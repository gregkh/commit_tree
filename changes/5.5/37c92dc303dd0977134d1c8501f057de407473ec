drm/i915: Add new CNL PCH ID seen on a CML platform

Atm we don't detect a PCH with PCI ID 0xA3C1 which showed up now on a CML
platform. We don't have the official assignment of the PCH PCI IDs, but
this looks like a CNP which was already used on CML platforms. Let's add
the new ID->PCH type mapping accordingly.
