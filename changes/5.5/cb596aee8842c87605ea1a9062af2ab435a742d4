habanalabs: Add a new H/W queue type

This patch adds a support for a new H/W queue type.
This type of queue is for DMA and compute engines jobs, for which
completion notification are sent by H/W.
Command buffer for this queue can be created either through the CB
IOCTL and using the retrieved CB handle, or by preparing a buffer on the
host or device SRAM/DRAM, and using the device address to that buffer.
The patch includes the handling of the 2 options, as well as the
initialization of the H/W queue and its jobs scheduling.
