arm64: dts: zii-ultra: Fix regulator-vsd-3v3's vin-supply

Regulator-vsd-3v3 is supplied via GEN_3V3 rail which is an output of
an "always on" load switch supplied by 3V3_MAIN. GEN_3V3 is also used
as vin-supply by a number of peripherals, so adding it also allows us
to follow the schematic more closely.
