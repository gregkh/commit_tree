dt-bindings: hspi: Convert bindings to json-schema

Convert Renesas HSPI bindings documentation to json-schema.
Also name bindings documentation file according to the compat string
being documented.

As a side effect of this change all currently supported/used compat
strings are listed while no while card compat string is documented.
This, in my opinion, is desirable as only supported hardware should
be documented.
