drm/i915/ringbuffer: Flush writes before RING_TAIL update

Be paranoid and make sure we flush any and all writes out of the WCB
before performing the UC mmio to update the RING_TAIL. (An UC write
should itself be enough to do the flush, hence the paranoia here.) Quite
infrequently, we see problems where the GPU seems to overshoot the
RING_TAIL and so executes garbage, hence the speculation.
