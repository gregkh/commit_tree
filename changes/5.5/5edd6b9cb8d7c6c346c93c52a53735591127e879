net/smc: introduce bookkeeping of SMCD link groups

If the ism module is unloaded return control from exit routine only,
if all link groups are freed.
If an IB device is thrown away return control from device removal only,
if all link groups belonging to this device are freed.
A counters for the total number of SMCD link groups per ISM device is
introduced. ism module unloading continues only if the total number of
SMCD link groups for all ISM devices is zero. ISM device
removal continues only it the total number of SMCD link groups per ISM
device has decreased to zero.
