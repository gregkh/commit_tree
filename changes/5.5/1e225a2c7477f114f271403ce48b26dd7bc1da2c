drm/i915/tgl: Add initial dkl pll support

The disable function can be the same as for MG phy since the same
registers are used. The others are different as registers changed,
also adding a empty dkl_pll_write() to be implemented later.

v2:
Setting the right HIP_INDEX_REG bits (José)

v3:
Masking non-computed registers of mg_pll_tdc_coldst_bias
when getting hardware state
Sharing mg_pll_enable() with TGL
