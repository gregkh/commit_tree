ASoC: pcm3168a: Use fixup instead of constraint for channels and formats

The snd_pcm_hw_constraint_minmax() works fine when a single codec is
connected to a single CPU DAI, but in multicodec or DPCM setup the
constraints placed by the driver will apply to the whole PCM stream (FE
included) and thus prevents more than 8 playback channels for example.
