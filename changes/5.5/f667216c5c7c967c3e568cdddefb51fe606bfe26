mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: re-implement erratum A-009204 workaround

The erratum A-009204 workaround patch was reverted because of
incorrect implementation.

8b6dc6b mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: Revert "mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: add
        erratum A-009204 support"

This patch is to re-implement the workaround (add a 5 ms delay
before setting SYSCTL[RSTD] to make sure all the DMA transfers
are finished).
