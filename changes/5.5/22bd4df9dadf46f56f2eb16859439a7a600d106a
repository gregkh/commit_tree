drm/panfrost: devfreq: Round frequencies to OPPs

Currently when setting a frequency in panfrost_devfreq_target the
returned frequency is the actual frequency that the clock driver reports
(the return of clk_get_rate()). However, where the provided OPPs don't
precisely match the frequencies that the clock actually achieves devfreq
will then complain (repeatedly):

  devfreq devfreq0: Couldn't update frequency transition information.

To avoid this change panfrost_devfreq_target() to fetch the opp using
devfreq_recommened_opp() and not actually query the clock for the
frequency.

A similar problem exists with panfrost_devfreq_get_cur_freq(), but in
this case because the function is optional we can just remove it and
devfreq will fall back to using the previously set frequency.
