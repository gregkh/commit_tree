libbpf: Fix BTF-defined map's __type macro handling of arrays

Due to a quirky C syntax of declaring pointers to array or function
prototype, existing __type() macro doesn't work with map key/value types
that are array or function prototype. One has to create a typedef first
and use it to specify key/value type for a BPF map.  By using typeof(),
pointer to type is now handled uniformly for all kinds of types. Convert
one of self-tests as a demonstration.
