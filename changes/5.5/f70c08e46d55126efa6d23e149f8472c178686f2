arm64: Kconfig: make CMDLINE_FORCE depend on CMDLINE

When building allmodconfig KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=$(pwd)/arch/arm64/configs/defconfig
CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE gets enabled. Which forces the user to pass the
full cmdline to CONFIG_CMDLINE="...".

Rework so that CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE gets set only if CONFIG_CMDLINE is
set to something except an empty string.
