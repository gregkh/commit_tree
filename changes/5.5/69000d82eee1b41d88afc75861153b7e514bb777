ext4: use RCU API in debug_print_tree

struct ext4_sb_info.system_blks was marked __rcu.
But access the pointer without using RCU lock and dereference.
Sparse warning with __rcu notation:

block_validity.c:139:29: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
block_validity.c:139:29:    expected struct rb_root const *
block_validity.c:139:29:    got struct rb_root [noderef] <asn:4> *
