iomap: remove unneeded variable in iomap_dio_rw()

The 'start' variable indicates the start of a filemap and is set to the
iocb's position, which we have already cached as 'pos', upon function
entry.

'pos' is used as a cursor indicating the current position and updated
later in iomap_dio_rw(), but not before the last use of 'start'.

Remove 'start' as it's synonym for 'pos' before we're entering the loop
calling iomapp_apply().
