pinctrl: lewisburg: Update pin list according to v1.1v6

Version 1.1v6 of pin list has some changes in pin names for Intel Lewisburg.

Update the driver accordingly.

Note, it reveals the bug in the driver that misses two pins in GPP_L and
has rather two extra ones. That's why the ordering of some groups is changed.
