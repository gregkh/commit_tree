iommu: Add gfp parameter to iommu_ops::map

Add a gfp_t parameter to the iommu_ops::map function.
Remove the needless locking in the AMD iommu driver.

The iommu_ops::map function (or the iommu_map function which calls it)
was always supposed to be sleepable (according to Joerg's comment in
this thread: https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/977520/ ) and so
should probably have had a "might_sleep()" since it was written. However
currently the dma-iommu api can call iommu_map in an atomic context,
which it shouldn't do. This doesn't cause any problems because any iommu
driver which uses the dma-iommu api uses gfp_atomic in it's
iommu_ops::map function. But doing this wastes the memory allocators
atomic pools.
