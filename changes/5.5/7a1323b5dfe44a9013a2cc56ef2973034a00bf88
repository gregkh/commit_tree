Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix crash handler reset of Hyper-V synic

The crash handler calls hv_synic_cleanup() to shutdown the
Hyper-V synthetic interrupt controller.  But if the CPU
that calls hv_synic_cleanup() has a VMbus channel interrupt
assigned to it (which is likely the case in smaller VM sizes),
hv_synic_cleanup() returns an error and the synthetic
interrupt controller isn't shutdown.  While the lack of
being shutdown hasn't caused a known problem, it still
should be fixed for highest reliability.

So directly call hv_synic_disable_regs() instead of
hv_synic_cleanup(), which ensures that the synic is always
shutdown.
