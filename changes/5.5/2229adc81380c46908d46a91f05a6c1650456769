drm/i915/execlist: Trim immediate timeslice expiry

We perform timeslicing immediately upon receipt of a request that may be
put into the second ELSP slot. The idea behind this was that since we
didn't install the timer if the second ELSP slot was empty, we would not
have any idea of how long ELSP[0] had been running and so giving the
newcomer a chance on the GPU was fair. However, this causes us extra
busy work that we may be able to avoid if we wait a jiffie for the first
timeslice as normal.
