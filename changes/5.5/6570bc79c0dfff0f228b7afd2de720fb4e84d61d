net: core: use listified Rx for GRO_NORMAL in napi_gro_receive()

Commit 323ebb61e32b4 ("net: use listified RX for handling GRO_NORMAL
skbs") made use of listified skb processing for the users of
napi_gro_frags().
The same technique can be used in a way more common napi_gro_receive()
to speed up non-merged (GRO_NORMAL) skbs for a wide range of drivers
including gro_cells and mac80211 users.
This slightly changes the return value in cases where skb is being
dropped by the core stack, but it seems to have no impact on related
drivers' functionality.
gro_normal_batch is left untouched as it's very individual for every
single system configuration and might be tuned in manual order to
achieve an optimal performance.
