staging: vchiq: Refactor indentation in vchiq_platform_conn_state_changed()

Reducing the indentation level helps a bit with
the readability of this function. There's also a checkpatch
fix here, moving the first argument to kthread_create() onto
the same line, as well as a relocation of the statement
"char threadname[16];" to the top of the function to avoid
a declaration in the middle of code.
