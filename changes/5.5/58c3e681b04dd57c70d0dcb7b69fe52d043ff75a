staging: vt6656: Fix non zero logical return of, usb_control_msg

Starting with commit 59608cb1de1856
("staging: vt6656: clean function's error path in usbpipe.c")
the usb control functions have returned errors throughout driver
with only logical variable checking.

However, usb_control_msg return the amount of bytes transferred
this means that normal operation causes errors.

Correct the return function so only return zero when transfer
is successful.
