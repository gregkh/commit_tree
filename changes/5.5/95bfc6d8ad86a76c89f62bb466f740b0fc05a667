scsi: lpfc: Make FW logging dynamically configurable

Currently, the FW logging facility is a load/boot time parameter which
requires the driver to be unloaded/reloaded or the system rebooted in order
to change its configuration.

Convert the logging facility to allow dynamic enablement and configuration.
Specifically:

 - Convert the feature so that it can be enabled dynamically via an
   attribute.  Additionally, the size of the buffer can be configured
   dynamically.

 - Add locks around states that now may be changing.

 - Tie the feature into debugfs so that the logs can be read at any time.
