bnxt_en: Allow PHY settings on multi-function or NPAR PFs if allowed by FW.

Currently, the driver does not allow PHY settings on a multi-function or
NPAR NIC whose port is shared by more than one function.  Newer
firmware now allows PHY settings on some of these NICs.  Check for
this new firmware setting and allow the user to set the PHY settings
accordingly.
