hugetlb: remove duplicated code

Remove duplicated code between region_chg and region_add, and refactor
it into a common function, add_reservation_in_range.  This is mostly
done because there is a follow up change in another series that disables
region coalescing in region_add, and I want to make that change in one
place only.  It should improve maintainability anyway on its own.
