net: hns3: fix for TX queue not restarted problem

There is timing window between ring_space checking and
netif_stop_subqueue when transmiting a SKB, and the TX BD
cleaning may be executed during the time window, which may
caused TX queue not restarted problem.

This patch fixes it by rechecking the ring_space after
netif_stop_subqueue to make sure TX queue is restarted.

Also, the ring->next_to_clean is updated even when pkts is
zero, because all the TX BD cleaned may be non-SKB, so it
needs to check if TX queue need to be restarted.
