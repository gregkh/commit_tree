bnxt_en: Call bnxt_ulp_stop()/bnxt_ulp_start() during error recovery.

Notify the RDMA driver by calling the bnxt_ulp_stop()/bnxt_ulp_start()
hooks during error recovery.  The current ULP IRQ start/stop
sequence in error recovery (which is insufficient) is replaced with the
full reset sequence when we call bnxt_ulp_stop()/bnxt_ulp_start().
