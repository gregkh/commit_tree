gpiolib: introduce devm_fwnode_gpiod_get_index()

devm_fwnode_get_index_gpiod_from_child() is too long, besides the fwnode
in question does not have to be a child of device node. Let's rename it
to devm_fwnode_gpiod_get_index() and keep the old name for compatibility
for now.

Also let's add a devm_fwnode_gpiod_get() wrapper as majority of the
callers need a single GPIO.
