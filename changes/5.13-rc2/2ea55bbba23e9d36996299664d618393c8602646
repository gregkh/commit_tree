locking/locktorture: Fix false positive circular locking splat in ww_mutex test

In order to avoid false positive circular locking lockdep splat
when runnng the ww_mutex torture test, we need to make sure that
the ww_mutexes have the same lock class as the acquire_ctx. This
means the ww_mutexes must have the same lockdep key as the
acquire_ctx. Unfortunately the current DEFINE_WW_MUTEX() macro fails
to do that. As a result, we add an init method for the ww_mutex test
to do explicit ww_mutex_init()'s of the ww_mutexes to avoid the false
positive warning.
