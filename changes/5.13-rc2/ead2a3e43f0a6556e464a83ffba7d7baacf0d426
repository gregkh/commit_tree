ASoC: mchp, i2s-mcc: Add property to specify pin pair for TDM

SAMA7G5's I2S-MCC has 4 pairs of DIN/DOUT pins. Since TDM only uses a
single pair of pins for synchronous capture and playback, the controller
needs to be told which of the pair is connected. This can be mentioned
using the new "microchip,tdm-data-pair" property. The property is optional,
needed only if TDM is used, and if it's missing DIN/DOUT 0 pins will be
used by default.
