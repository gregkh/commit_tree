drm/i915: Extend icl_sanitize_encoder_pll_mapping() to all DDI platforms

Now that all the encoder clock stuff is uniformly abstracted
for all hsw+ platforms, let's extend icl_sanitize_encoder_pll_mapping()
to cover all of them.

Not sure there is a particular benefit in doing so, but less special
cases always makes me happy.
