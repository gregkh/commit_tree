scsi: lpfc: Fix missing FDMI registrations after Mgmt Svc login

FDMI registration needs to be performed after every login with the FC Mgmt
service. The flag the driver is using to track registration is cleared on
link up, but never on Mgmt service logout/re-login.

Fix by clearing the flag whenever a new login is completed with the FC Mgmt
service.

While perusing the flag use, logging was performed as if FDMI registration
occurred on vports. However, it is limited to the physical port only.
Revise the logging to reflect physical port based.
