riscv: sifive: Apply errata "cip-1200" patch

For certain SiFive CPUs, "sfence.vma addr" cannot exactly flush addr
from TLB in the particular cases. The details could be found here:

In order to ensure the functionality, this patch uses the Alternative
scheme to replace all "sfence.vma addr" with "sfence.vma" at runtime.
