ARM: tegra: ouya: Specify all CPU cores as cooling devices

If CPU0 is unplugged the cooling device can not rebind to CPU1. And if
CPU0 is plugged in again, the cooling device may fail to initialize.

If the CPUs are mapped with the physical CPU0 to Linux numbering
CPU1, the cooling device mapping will fail.

Hence specify all CPU cores as a cooling devices in the device-tree.
