ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: drop display power on/off in D0i3 flows

Controller needs to ensure display power is enabled only for
HDA controller reset. Drop the display power-up/down calls from
D0i3 entry/exit paths.

This was previously not possible as codec drivers could not resume the
links, and instead controller kept the reference to display power. The
state of display power had be maintained in the D0i3 entry/exit code.
With commit 87fc20e4a0cb ("ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: use hdac_ext
fine-grained link management"), this is no longer needed and the code
can be cleaned up.
