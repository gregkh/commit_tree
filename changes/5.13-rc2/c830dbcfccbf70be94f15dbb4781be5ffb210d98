ACPI: scan: Call acpi_get_object_info() from acpi_set_pnp_ids()

Notice that it is not necessary to call acpi_get_object_info() from
acpi_add_single_object() in order to pass the pointer returned by it
to acpi_init_device_object() and from there to acpi_set_pnp_ids().

It is more straightforward to call acpi_get_object_info() from
acpi_set_pnp_ids() and avoid unnecessary pointer passing, so change
the code accordingly.

No intentional functional impact.
