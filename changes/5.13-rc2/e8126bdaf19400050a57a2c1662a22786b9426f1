KVM: SVM: Move SEV module params/variables to sev.c

Unconditionally invoke sev_hardware_setup() when configuring SVM and
handle clearing the module params/variable 'sev' and 'sev_es' in
sev_hardware_setup().  This allows making said variables static within
sev.c and reduces the odds of a collision with guest code, e.g. the guest
side of things has already laid claim to 'sev_enabled'.
