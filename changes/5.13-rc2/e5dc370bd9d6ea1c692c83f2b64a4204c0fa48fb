RDMA/mlx5: Set ODP caps only if device profile support ODP

Currently, ODP caps are set during the init stage of mlx5_ib_dev,
regardless of whether the device profile supports ODP or not.  There is no
point in setting ODP caps if the device profile doesn't support
ODP. Hence, move setting the ODP caps to the odp_init stage.
