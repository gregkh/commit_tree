gpu: host1x: Use HW-equivalent syncpoint expiration check

Make syncpoint expiration checks always use the same logic used by
the hardware. This ensures that there are no race conditions that
could occur because of the hardware triggering a syncpoint interrupt
and then the driver disagreeing.

One situation where this could occur is if a job incremented a
syncpoint too many times -- then the hardware would trigger an
interrupt, but the driver would assume that a syncpoint value
greater than the syncpoint's max value is in the future, and not
clean up the job.
