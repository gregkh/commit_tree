drm/i915/gt: Retire unexpected starting state error dumping

We have not seen an occurrence of the false restart state recenty, and if
we did see such an event from inside engine-reset, it would deadlock on
trying to suspend the tasklet to read the register state (from inside
the tasklet). Instead, we inspect the context state before submission
which will alert us to any issues prior to execution on HW.
