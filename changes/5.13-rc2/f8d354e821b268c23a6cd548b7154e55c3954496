thermal/drivers/devfreq_cooling: Use device name instead of auto-numbering

Currently the naming of a cooling device is just a cooling technique
followed by a number. When there are multiple cooling devices using
the same technique, it is impossible to clearly identify the related
device as this one is just a number.

For instance:

 thermal-devfreq-0
 thermal-devfreq-1
 etc ...

The 'thermal' prefix is redundant with the subsystem namespace. This
patch removes the 'thermal' prefix and changes the number by the device
name. So the naming above becomes:

 devfreq-5000000.gpu
 devfreq-1d84000.ufshc
 etc ...
