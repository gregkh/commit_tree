arm64: dts: qcom: Prep sc7180-trogdor trackpad IRQ for new boards

The trackpad interrupt got renamed and also moved to a new GPIO on
newer boards.  Let's do the move in the "trogdor.dtsi" file and then
undo it in the two old boards.

NOTE: since none of the new boards have device trees yet, this change
looks silly on its own but it will make sense after more boards are
supported.
