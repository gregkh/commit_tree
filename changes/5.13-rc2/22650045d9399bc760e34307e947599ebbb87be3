ARM: dts: r8a7742-iwg21d-q7-dbcm-ca: Add support for 8-bit ov7725 sensors

The 8-bit ov7725 sensors can also be connected to the camera daughter
board.

This patch creates a separate dtsi file to describe an ov7725 sensor,
and includes it multiple times in r8a7742-iwg21d-q7-dbcm-ca.dts. The
user can (un)comment #include statements depending on the cameras
connected.
