powerpc/kexec_file: Use current CPU info while setting up FDT

kexec_file_load() uses initial_boot_params in setting up the device tree
for the kernel to be loaded. Though initial_boot_params holds info about
CPUs at the time of boot, it doesn't account for hot added CPUs.

So, kexec'ing with kexec_file_load() syscall leaves the kexec'ed kernel
with inaccurate CPU info.

If kdump kernel is loaded with kexec_file_load() syscall and the system
crashes on a hot added CPU, the capture kernel hangs failing to identify
the boot CPU, with no output.

To avoid this from happening, extract current CPU info from of_root
device node and use it for setting up the fdt in kexec_file_load case.
