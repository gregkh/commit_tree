mm/memory_hotplug: remove broken locking of zone PCP structures during hot remove

zone_pcp_reset allegedly protects against a race with drain_pages using
local_irq_save but this is bogus.  local_irq_save only operates on the
local CPU.  If memory hotplug is running on CPU A and drain_pages is
running on CPU B, disabling IRQs on CPU A does not affect CPU B and
offers no protection.

This patch deletes IRQ disable/enable on the grounds that IRQs protect
nothing and assumes the existing hotplug paths guarantees the PCP cannot
be used after zone_pcp_enable().  That should be the case already
because all the pages have been freed and there is no page to put on the
PCP lists.
