usb: dwc2: Update dwc2_handle_usb_suspend_intr function.

To avoid working in two modes (partial power down
and hibernation) changed conditions for entering
partial power down or hibernation.

Instead of checking hw_params.power_optimized and
hw_params.hibernation now checking power_down
param which already set to one of the options
(Hibernation or Partial Power Down) based on
OTG_EN_PWROPT.
