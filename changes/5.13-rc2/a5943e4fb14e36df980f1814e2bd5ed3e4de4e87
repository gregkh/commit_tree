soundwire: qcom: check of_property_read status

Cppcheck complains:

drivers/soundwire/qcom.c:773:6: style: Variable 'ret' is assigned a
value that is never used. [unreadVariable]
 ret = of_property_read_u8_array(np, "qcom,ports-block-pack-mode",
     ^

The return value is checked for all other cases, not sure why it was
missed here.
