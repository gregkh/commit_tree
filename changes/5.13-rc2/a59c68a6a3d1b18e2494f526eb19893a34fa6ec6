usb: gadget: f_uac1: validate input parameters

Currently user can configure UAC1 function with
parameters that violate UAC1 spec or are not supported
by UAC1 gadget implementation.

This can lead to incorrect behavior if such gadget
is connected to the host - like enumeration failure
or other issues depending on host's UAC1 driver
implementation, bringing user to a long hours
of debugging the issue.

Instead of silently accept these parameters, throw
an error if they are not valid.
