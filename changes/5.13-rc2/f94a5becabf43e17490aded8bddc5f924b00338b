extconn: Clean-up few drivers by using managed work init

Few drivers implement remove call-back only for ensuring a delayed
work gets cancelled prior driver removal. Clean-up these by switching
to use devm_delayed_work_autocancel() instead.

Additionally, this helps avoiding mixing devm and manual resource
management and cleans up a (theoretical?) bug from extconn-palmas.c
and extcon-qcom-spmi-misc.c where (devm managed)IRQ might schedule
new work item after wq was cleaned at remove().

This change is compile-tested only. All testing is appreciated.
