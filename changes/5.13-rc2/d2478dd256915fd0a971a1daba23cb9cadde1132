scsi: fnic: Remove bogus ratelimit messages

Commit b43abcbbd5b1 ("scsi: fnic: Ratelimit printks to avoid flooding when
vlan is not set by the switch.i") added printk_ratelimit() in front of a
couple of debug-mode messages to reduce logging overrun when debugging the
driver. The code:

>           if (printk_ratelimit())
>                   FNIC_FCS_DBG(KERN_DEBUG, fnic->lport->host,
>                             "Start VLAN Discovery\n");

ends up calling printk_ratelimit() quite often, triggering many kernel
messages about callbacks being supressed.

The fix is to decompose FNIC_FCS_DBG(), then change the order of checks so
that printk_ratelimit() is only called if driver debugging is enabled.
