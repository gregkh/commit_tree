nvme-multipath: fix double initialization of ANA state

nvme_init_identify and thus nvme_mpath_init can be called multiple
times and thus must not overwrite potentially initialized or in-use
fields.  Split out a helper for the basic initialization when the
controller is initialized and make sure the init_identify path does
not blindly change in-use data structures.
