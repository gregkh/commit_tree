KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix kvm_unmap_gfn_range_hv() for Hash MMU

Commit 32b48bf8514c ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix conversion to gfn-based
MMU notifier callbacks") fixed kvm_unmap_gfn_range_hv() by adding a for
loop over each gfn in the range.

But for the Hash MMU it repeatedly calls kvm_unmap_rmapp() with the
first gfn of the range, rather than iterating through the range.

This exhibits as strange guest behaviour, sometimes crashing in firmare,
or booting and then guest userspace crashing unexpectedly.

Fix it by passing the iterator, gfn, to kvm_unmap_rmapp().
