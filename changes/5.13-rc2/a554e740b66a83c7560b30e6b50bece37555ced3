x86/boot/compressed: Enable -Wundef

A discussion around -Wundef showed that there were still a few boolean
Kconfigs where #if was used rather than #ifdef to guard different code.
Kconfig doesn't define boolean configs, which can result in -Wundef
warnings.

arch/x86/boot/compressed/Makefile resets the CFLAGS used for this
directory, and doesn't re-enable -Wundef as the top level Makefile does.
If re-added, with RANDOMIZE_BASE and X86_NEED_RELOCS disabled, the
following warnings are visible.

  arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.h:82:5: warning: 'CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_BASE'
  is not defined, evaluates to 0 [-Wundef]
      ^
  arch/x86/boot/compressed/misc.c:175:5: warning: 'CONFIG_X86_NEED_RELOCS'
  is not defined, evaluates to 0 [-Wundef]
      ^

Simply fix these and re-enable this warning for this directory.
