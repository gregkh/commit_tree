KVM: nSVM: remove a warning about vmcb01 VM exit reason

While in most cases, when returning to use the VMCB01,
the exit reason stored in it will be SVM_EXIT_VMRUN,
on first VM exit after a nested migration this field
can contain anything since the VM entry did happen
before the migration.

Remove this warning to avoid the false positive.
