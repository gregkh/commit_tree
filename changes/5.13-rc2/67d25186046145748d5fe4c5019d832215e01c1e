ext4: drop s_mb_bal_lock and convert protected fields to atomic

s_mb_buddies_generated gets used later in this patch series to
determine if the cr 0 and cr 1 optimziations should be performed or
not. Currently, s_mb_buddies_generated is protected under a
spin_lock. In the allocation path, it is better if we don't depend on
the lock and instead read the value atomically. In order to do that,
we drop s_bal_lock altogether and we convert the only two protected
fields by it s_mb_buddies_generated and s_mb_generation_time to atomic
type.
