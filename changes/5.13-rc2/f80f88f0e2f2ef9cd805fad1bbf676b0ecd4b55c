selftests/bpf: Fix the snprintf test

The BPF program for the snprintf selftest runs on all syscall entries.
On busy multicore systems this can cause concurrency issues.

For example it was observed that sometimes the userspace part of the
test reads "    4 0000" instead of "    4 000" (extra '0' at the end)
which seems to happen just before snprintf on another core sets
end[-1] = '\0'.

This patch adds a pid filter to the test to ensure that no
bpf_snprintf() will write over the test's output buffers while the
userspace reads the values.
