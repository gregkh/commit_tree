fsnotify: allow fsnotify_{peek,remove}_first_event with empty queue

Current code has an assumtion that fsnotify_notify_queue_is_empty() is
called to verify that queue is not empty before trying to peek or remove
an event from queue.

Remove this assumption by moving the fsnotify_notify_queue_is_empty()
into the functions, allow them to return NULL value and check return
value by all callers.

This is a prep patch for multi event queues.
