crypto: hisilicon/hpre - delete redundant log and return in advance

'hpre_cfg_by_dsm' has checked and printed error path internally. It is not
necessary to do it here, so remove it.

It should return error immediately when return value of 'hpre_cfg_by_dsm'
is non-zero, and no need to execute the remaining sentences.
