tpm: fix error return code in tpm2_get_cc_attrs_tbl()

If the total number of commands queried through TPM2_CAP_COMMANDS is
different from that queried through TPM2_CC_GET_CAPABILITY, it indicates
an unknown error. In this case, an appropriate error code -EFAULT should
be returned. However, we currently do not explicitly assign this error
code to 'rc'. As a result, 0 was incorrectly returned.
