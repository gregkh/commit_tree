gpiolib: acpi: Add quirk to ignore EC wakeups on Dell Venue 10 Pro 5055

Like some other Bay and Cherry Trail SoC based devices the Dell Venue
10 Pro 5055 has an embedded-controller which uses ACPI GPIO events to
report events instead of using the standard ACPI EC interface for this.

The EC interrupt is only used to report battery-level changes and
it keeps doing this while the system is suspended, causing the system
to not stay suspended.

Add an ignore-wake quirk for the GPIO pin used by the EC to fix the
spurious wakeups from suspend.
