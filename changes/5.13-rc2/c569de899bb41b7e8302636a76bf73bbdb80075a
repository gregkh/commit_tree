scsi: mpt3sas: Force reply post array allocations to be within same 4 GB region

According to the MPI specification, reply post array buffers can not cross
a 4 GB boundary.

While allocating, if any buffer crosses the 4 GB boundary, then:

 - Release the already allocated memory pools; and

 - Reallocate them by changing the DMA coherent mask to 32-bit
