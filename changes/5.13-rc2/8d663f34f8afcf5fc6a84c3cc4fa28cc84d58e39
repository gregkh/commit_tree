blk-mq: bypass IO scheduler's limit_depth for passthrough request

Commit 01e99aeca39796003 ("blk-mq: insert passthrough request into
hctx->dispatch directly") gives high priority to passthrough requests and
bypass underlying IO scheduler. But as we allocate tag for such request it
still runs io-scheduler's callback limit_depth, while we really want is to
give full sbitmap-depth capabity to such request for acquiring available
tag.
blktrace shows PC requests(dmraid -s -c -i) hit bfq's limit_depth:
  8,0    2        0     0.000000000 39952 1,0  m   N bfq [bfq_limit_depth] wr_busy 0 sync 0 depth 8
  8,0    2        1     0.000008134 39952  D   R 4 [dmraid]
  8,0    2        2     0.000021538    24  C   R [0]
  8,0    2        0     0.000035442 39952 1,0  m   N bfq [bfq_limit_depth] wr_busy 0 sync 0 depth 8
  8,0    2        3     0.000038813 39952  D   R 24 [dmraid]
  8,0    2        4     0.000044356    24  C   R [0]

This patch introduce a new wrapper to make code not that ugly.
