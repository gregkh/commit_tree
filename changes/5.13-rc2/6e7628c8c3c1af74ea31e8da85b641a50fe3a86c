PCI: microchip: Remove dev_err() when handing an error from platform_get_irq()

There is no need to call the dev_err() function directly to print a
custom message when handling an error from either the platform_get_irq()
or platform_get_irq_byname() functions as both are going to display an
appropriate error message in case of a failure.

This change is as per suggestions from Coccinelle, e.g.,
  drivers/pci/controller/pcie-microchip-host.c:1027:2-9: line 1027 is
  redundant because platform_get_irq() already prints an error
