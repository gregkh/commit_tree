genirq: Allow architectures to override set_handle_irq() fallback

Some architectures want to provide the generic set_handle_irq() API, but
for structural reasons need to provide their own implementation. For
example, arm64 needs to do this to provide uniform set_handle_irq() and
set_handle_fiq() registration functions.

Make this possible by allowing architectures to provide their own
implementation of set_handle_irq when CONFIG_GENERIC_IRQ_MULTI_HANDLER
is not selected.
