hwmon: raspberry-pi: Clean-up few drivers by using managed work init

Few drivers implement remove call-back only for ensuring a delayed
work gets cancelled prior driver removal. Clean-up these by switching
to use devm_delayed_work_autocancel() instead.

This change is compile-tested only. All testing is appreciated.
