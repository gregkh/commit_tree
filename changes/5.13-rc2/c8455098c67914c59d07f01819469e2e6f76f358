drm/i915/gen9_bc: Introduce HPD pin mappings for TGP PCH + CML combos

Next, let's start introducing the HPD pin mappings for Intel's new gen9_bc
platform in order to make hotplugging display connectors work. Since
gen9_bc is just a TGP PCH along with a CML CPU, except with the same HPD
mappings as ICL, we simply add a skl_hpd_pin function that is shared
between gen9 and gen9_bc which handles both the traditional gen9 HPD pin
mappings and the Icelake HPD pin mappings that gen9_bc uses.

Changes since v4:
* Split this into its own commit
* Introduce skl_hpd_pin() like vsyrjala suggested and use that instead of
  sticking our HPD pin mappings in TGP code
