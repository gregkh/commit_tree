blk-mq: plug request for shared sbitmap

In case of shared sbitmap, request won't be held in plug list any more
sine commit 32bc15afed04 ("blk-mq: Facilitate a shared sbitmap per
tagset"), this way makes request merge from flush plug list & batching
submission not possible, so cause performance regression.

Yanhui reports performance regression when running sequential IO
test(libaio, 16 jobs, 8 depth for each job) in VM, and the VM disk
is emulated with image stored on xfs/megaraid_sas.

Fix the issue by recovering original behavior to allow to hold request
in plug list.
