serial: xilinx_uartps: drop low-latency workaround

Commit c8dbdc842d30 ("serial: xuartps: Rewrite the interrupt handling
logic") reworked the driver interrupt processing but also, without
comment, added an unnecessary workaround for the infamous low_latency
behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push() which had been removed years
before.

Specifically, since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks around.
