netfilter: x_tables: remove paranoia tests

No need for these.
There is only one caller, the xtables core, when the table is registered
for the first time with a particular network namespace.

After ->table_init() call, the table is linked into the tables[af] list,
so next call to that function will skip the ->table_init().
