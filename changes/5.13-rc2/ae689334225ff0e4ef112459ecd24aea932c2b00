netfilter: ip_tables: pass table pointer via nf_hook_ops

iptable_x modules rely on 'struct net' to contain a pointer to the
table that should be evaluated.

In order to remove these pointers from struct net, pass them via
the 'priv' pointer in a similar fashion as nf_tables passes the
rule data.

To do that, duplicate the nf_hook_info array passed in from the
iptable_x modules, update the ops->priv pointers of the copy to
refer to the table and then change the hookfn implementations to
just pass the 'priv' argument to the traverser.

After this patch, the xt_table pointers can already be removed
from struct net.

However, changes to struct net result in re-compile of the entire
network stack, so do the removal after arptables and ip6tables
have been converted as well.
