Input: cyttsp - reduce reset pulse timings

The data sheet for CY8CTMA340 specifies that the reset pulse shall be at
least 1 ms. Specify 1-2 ms with usleep_range() to cut some slack for the
scheduler.

Curiously the datasheet does not specify how long we have to wait after a
hard reset until the chip is up, but I have found a vendor tree (Samsung
GT-S7710) that has code for this touch screen and there this is set to 5
ms so I use this with the same 1 ms fuzz.
