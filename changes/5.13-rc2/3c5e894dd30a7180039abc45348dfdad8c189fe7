media: venus: hfi: Define block offsets for V6 hardware

This commit defines a range of new base addresses for already defined
blocks.

- CPU_BASE_V6
- CPU_CS_BASE_V6
- CPU_IC_BASE_V6
- WRAPPER_BASE_V6

The base addresses of the blocks are slightly different for 6xx but, aside
from that are layout and bit compatible.

New 6xx specific block addresses will be added in separate commits.
