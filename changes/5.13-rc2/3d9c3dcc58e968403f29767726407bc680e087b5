scsi: storvsc: Enable scatterlist entry lengths > 4Kbytes

storvsc currently sets .dma_boundary to limit scatterlist entries to 4
Kbytes, which is less efficient with huge pages that offer large chunks of
contiguous physical memory. Improve the algorithm for creating the Hyper-V
guest physical address PFN array so that scatterlist entries with lengths >
4Kbytes are handled.  As a result, remove the .dma_boundary setting.

The improved algorithm also adds support for scatterlist entries with
offsets >= 4Kbytes, which is supported by many other SCSI low-level
drivers.  And it retains support for architectures where possibly PAGE_SIZE
!= HV_HYP_PAGE_SIZE (such as ARM64).
