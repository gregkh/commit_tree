cifs: constify get_normalized_path() properly

As it is, it takes const char * and, in some cases, stores it in
caller's variable that is plain char *.  Fortunately, none of the
callers actually proceeded to modify the string via now-non-const
alias, but that's trouble waiting to happen.

It's easy to do properly, anyway...
