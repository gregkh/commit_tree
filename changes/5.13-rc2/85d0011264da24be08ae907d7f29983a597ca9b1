KVM: x86: Emulate RDPID only if RDTSCP is supported

Do not advertise emulation support for RDPID if RDTSCP is unsupported.
RDPID emulation subtly relies on MSR_TSC_AUX to exist in hardware, as
both vmx_get_msr() and svm_get_msr() will return an error if the MSR is
unsupported, i.e. ctxt->ops->get_msr() will fail and the emulator will
inject a #UD.

Note, RDPID emulation also relies on RDTSCP being enabled in the guest,
but this is a KVM bug and will eventually be fixed.
