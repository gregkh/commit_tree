selftests/bpf: Expose and rename debug argument

Launching xdpxceiver with -D enables what was formerly know as 'debug'
mode. Rename this mode to 'dump-pkts' as it better describes the
behavior enabled by the option. New usage:

./xdpxceiver .. -D
or
./xdpxceiver .. --dump-pkts

Also make it possible to pass this flag to the app via the test_xsk.sh
shell script like so:

./test_xsk.sh -D
