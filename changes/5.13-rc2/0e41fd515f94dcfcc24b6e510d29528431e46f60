iio: hid-sensors: Move get sensitivity attribute to hid-sensor-common

No functional change has been made with this patch. The main intent here
is to reduce code repetition of getting sensitivity attribute.

In the current implementation, sensor_hub_input_get_attribute_info() is
called from multiple drivers to get attribute info for sensitivity
field. Moving this to common place will avoid code repetition.
