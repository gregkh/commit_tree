irqdomain: Introduce irq_domain_create_simple() API

Linus Walleij pointed out that ird_domain_add_simple() gained
additional functionality and can't be anymore replaced with
a simple conditional. In preparation to upgrade GPIO library
to use fwnode, introduce irq_domain_create_simple() API which is
functional equivalent to the existing irq_domain_add_simple(),
but takes a pointer to the struct fwnode_handle as a parameter.

While at it, amend documentation to mention irq_domain_create_*()
functions where it makes sense.
