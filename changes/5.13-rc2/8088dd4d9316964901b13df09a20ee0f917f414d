remoteproc: Properly deal with the resource table when stopping

When a remote processor that was attached to is stopped, special care
must be taken to make sure the shutdown process is similar to what
it would be had it been started by the remoteproc core.

This patch takes care of that by making a copy of the resource
table currently used by the remote processor.  From that point on
the copy is used, as if the remote processor had been started by
the remoteproc core.
