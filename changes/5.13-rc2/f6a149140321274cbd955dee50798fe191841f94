kcsan: Switch to KUNIT_CASE_PARAM for parameterized tests

Since KUnit now support parameterized tests via KUNIT_CASE_PARAM, update
KCSAN's test to switch to it for parameterized tests. This simplifies
parameterized tests and gets rid of the "parameters in case name"
workaround (hack).

At the same time, we can increase the maximum number of threads used,
because on systems with too few CPUs, KUnit allows us to now stop at the
maximum useful threads and not unnecessarily execute redundant test
cases with (the same) limited threads as had been the case before.
