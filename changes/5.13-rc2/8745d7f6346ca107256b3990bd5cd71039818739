mm/gup: add compound page list iterator

Patch series "mm/gup: page unpining improvements", v4.

This series improves page unpinning, with an eye on improving MR
deregistration for big swaths of memory (which is bound by the page
unpining), particularly:

1) Decrement the head page by @ntails and thus reducing a lot the
   number of atomic operations per compound page.  This is done by
   comparing individual tail pages heads, and counting number of
   consecutive tails on which they match heads and based on that update
   head page refcount.  Should have a visible improvement in all page
   (un)pinners which use compound pages

2) Introducing a new API for unpinning page ranges (to avoid the trick
   in the previous item and be based on math), and use that in RDMA
   ib_mem_release (used for mr deregistration).

Performance improvements: unpin_user_pages() for hugetlbfs and THP
improves ~3x (through gup_test) and RDMA MR dereg improves ~4.5x with the
new API.  See patches 2 and 4 for those.

This patch (of 4):

Add a helper that iterates over head pages in a list of pages.  It
essentially counts the tails until the next page to process has a
different head that the current.  This is going to be used by
unpin_user_pages() family of functions, to batch the head page refcount
updates once for all passed consecutive tail pages.
