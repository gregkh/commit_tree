iio: iio_enum_available_read(): Convert to sysfs_emit_at()

sysfs_emit() is preferred over raw s*printf() for sysfs attributes since it
knows about the sysfs buffer specifics and has some built-in sanity checks.

Convert the iio_enum_available_read() function to use sysfs_emit_at()
instead of scnprintf().

The conversion is straight forward, the only difference is that
sysfs_emit_at() takes the buffers start address and an offset as parameters
and already knows about the buffer's size limit.
