serial: stm32: fix probe and remove order for dma

The probe and remove orders are wrong as the uart_port is registered
before saving device data in the probe, and unregistered after DMA
resource deallocation in the remove. uart_port registering should be
done at the end of probe and unregistering should be done at the begin of
remove to avoid resource allocation issues.

Fix probe and remove orders. This enforce resource allocation occur at
proper time.
Terminate both DMA rx and tx transfers before removing device.

Move pm_runtime after uart_remove_one_port() call in remove() to keep the
probe error path.
