x86/sev: Move GHCB MSR protocol and NAE definitions in a common header

The guest and the hypervisor contain separate macros to get and set
the GHCB MSR protocol and NAE event fields. Consolidate the GHCB
protocol definitions and helper macros in one place.

Leave the supported protocol version define in separate files to keep
the guest and hypervisor flexibility to support different GHCB version
in the same release.

There is no functional change intended.
