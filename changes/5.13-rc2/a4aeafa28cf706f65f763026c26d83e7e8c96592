netfilter: xt_nat: pass table to hookfn

This changes how ip(6)table nat passes the ruleset/table to the
evaluation loop.

At the moment, it will fetch the table from struct net.

This change stores the table in the hook_ops 'priv' argument
instead.

This requires to duplicate the hook_ops for each netns, so
they can store the (per-net) xt_table structure.

The dupliated nat hook_ops get stored in net_generic data area.
They are free'd in the namespace exit path.

This is a pre-requisite to remove the xt_table/ruleset pointers
from struct net.
