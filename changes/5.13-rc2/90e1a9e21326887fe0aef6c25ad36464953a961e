nexthop: Add a dedicated flag for multipath next-hop groups

With the introduction of resilient nexthop groups, there will be two types
of multipath groups: the current hash-threshold "mpath" ones, and resilient
groups. Both are multipath, but to determine the fact, the system needs to
consider two flags. This might prove costly in the datapath. Therefore,
introduce a new flag, that should be set for next-hop groups that have more
than one nexthop, and should be considered multipath.
