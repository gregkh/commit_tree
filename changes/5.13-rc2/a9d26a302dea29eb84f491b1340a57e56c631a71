selftests/resctrl: Enable gcc checks to detect buffer overflows

David reported a buffer overflow error in the check_results() function of
the cmt unit test and he suggested enabling _FORTIFY_SOURCE gcc compiler
option to automatically detect any such errors.

Feature Test Macros man page describes_FORTIFY_SOURCE as below

"Defining this macro causes some lightweight checks to be performed to
detect some buffer overflow errors when employing various string and memory
manipulation functions (for example, memcpy, memset, stpcpy, strcpy,
strncpy, strcat, strncat, sprintf, snprintf, vsprintf, vsnprintf, gets, and
wide character variants thereof). For some functions, argument consistency
is checked; for example, a check is made that open has been supplied with a
mode argument when the specified flags include O_CREAT. Not all problems
are detected, just some common cases.

If _FORTIFY_SOURCE is set to 1, with compiler optimization level 1 (gcc
-O1) and above, checks that shouldn't change the behavior of conforming
programs are performed.

With _FORTIFY_SOURCE set to 2, some more checking is added, but some
conforming programs might fail.

Some of the checks can be performed at compile time (via macros logic
implemented in header files), and result in compiler warnings; other checks
take place at run time, and result in a run-time error if the check fails.

Use of this macro requires compiler support, available with gcc since
version 4.0."

Fix the buffer overflow error in the check_results() function of the cmt
unit test and enable _FORTIFY_SOURCE gcc check to catch any future buffer
overflow errors.
