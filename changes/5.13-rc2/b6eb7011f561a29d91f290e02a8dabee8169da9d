RDMA/core: Correct format of braces

Do following cleanups about braces:

- Add the necessary braces to maintain context alignment.
- Fix the open '{' that is not on the same line as "switch".
- Remove braces that are not necessary for single statement blocks.
- Fix "else" that doesn't follow close brace '}'.
