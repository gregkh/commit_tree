sched/fair: Fix clearing of has_idle_cores flag in select_idle_cpu()

In commit:

  9fe1f127b913 ("sched/fair: Merge select_idle_core/cpu()")

in select_idle_cpu(), we check if an idle core is present in the LLC
of the target CPU via the flag "has_idle_cores". We look for the idle
core in select_idle_cores(). If select_idle_cores() isn't able to find
an idle core/CPU, we need to unset the has_idle_cores flag in the LLC
of the target to prevent other CPUs from going down this route.

However, the current code is unsetting it in the LLC of the current
CPU instead of the target CPU. This patch fixes this issue.
