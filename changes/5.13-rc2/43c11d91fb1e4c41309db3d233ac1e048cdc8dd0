KVM: x86: to track if L1 is running L2 VM

The new per-cpu stat 'nested_run' is introduced in order to track if L1 VM
is running or used to run L2 VM.

An example of the usage of 'nested_run' is to help the host administrator
to easily track if any L1 VM is used to run L2 VM. Suppose there is issue
that may happen with nested virtualization, the administrator will be able
to easily narrow down and confirm if the issue is due to nested
virtualization via 'nested_run'. For example, whether the fix like
commit 88dddc11a8d6 ("KVM: nVMX: do not use dangling shadow VMCS after
guest reset") is required.
