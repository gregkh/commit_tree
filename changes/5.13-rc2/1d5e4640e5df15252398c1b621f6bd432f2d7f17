ARC: mm: Use max_high_pfn as a HIGHMEM zone border

Commit 4af22ded0ecf ("arc: fix memory initialization for systems
with two memory banks") fixed highmem, but for the PAE case it causes
bug messages:

This is because the fix expects highmem to be always less than
lowmem and uses min_low_pfn as an upper zone border for highmem.

max_high_pfn should be ok for both highmem and highmem+PAE cases.
