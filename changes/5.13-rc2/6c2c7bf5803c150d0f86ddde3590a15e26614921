KVM: SVM: Enable SEV/SEV-ES functionality by default (when supported)

Enable the 'sev' and 'sev_es' module params by default instead of having
them conditioned on CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT_ACTIVE_BY_DEFAULT.  The extra
Kconfig is pointless as KVM SEV/SEV-ES support is already controlled via
CONFIG_KVM_AMD_SEV, and CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT_ACTIVE_BY_DEFAULT has the
unfortunate side effect of enabling all the SEV-ES _guest_ code due to
it being dependent on CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT=y.
