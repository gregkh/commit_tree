scsi: ufs: ufs-debugfs: Add user-defined exception_event_mask

Allow users to enable specific exception events via debugfs.

The bits enabled by the driver ee_drv_ctrl are separated from the bits
enabled by the user ee_usr_ctrl. The control mask ee_mask_ctrl is the
logical-or of those two. A mutex is needed to ensure that the masks match
what was written to the device.
