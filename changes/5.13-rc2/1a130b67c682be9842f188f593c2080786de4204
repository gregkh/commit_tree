powerpc: Reference parameter in MSR_TM_ACTIVE() macro

Unlike the other MSR_TM_* macros, MSR_TM_ACTIVE does not reference or
use its parameter unless CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM is defined. This
causes an 'unused variable' compile warning unless the variable is also
guarded with CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM.

Reference but do nothing with the argument in the macro to avoid a
potential compile warning.
