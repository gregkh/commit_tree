drivers: gpu: drm: bridge: fix kconfig dependency on DRM_KMS_HELPER

When DRM_TOSHIBA_TC358762 is enabled and DRM_KMS_HELPER is disabled,
Kbuild gives the following warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for DRM_PANEL_BRIDGE
  Depends on [n]: HAS_IOMEM [=y] && DRM_BRIDGE [=y] && DRM_KMS_HELPER [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - DRM_TOSHIBA_TC358762 [=y] && HAS_IOMEM [=y] && DRM [=y] && DRM_BRIDGE [=y] && OF [=y]

This is because DRM_TOSHIBA_TC358762 selects DRM_PANEL_BRIDGE,
without depending on or selecting DRM_KMS_HELPER,
despite that config option depending on DRM_KMS_HELPER.
