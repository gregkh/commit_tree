landlock: Add ruleset and domain management

A Landlock ruleset is mainly a red-black tree with Landlock rules as
nodes.  This enables quick update and lookup to match a requested
access, e.g. to a file.  A ruleset is usable through a dedicated file
descriptor (cf. following commit implementing syscalls) which enables a
process to create and populate a ruleset with new rules.

A domain is a ruleset tied to a set of processes.  This group of rules
defines the security policy enforced on these processes and their future
children.  A domain can transition to a new domain which is the
intersection of all its constraints and those of a ruleset provided by
the current process.  This modification only impact the current process.
This means that a process can only gain more constraints (i.e. lose
accesses) over time.
