ASoC: wm8962: Relax bit clock divider searching

With S20_3LE format case, the sysclk = rate * 384,
the bclk = rate * 20 * 2, there is no proper bclk divider
for 384 / 40, because current condition needs exact match.
So driver fails to configure the clocking:

wm8962 3-001a: Unsupported BCLK ratio 9

Fix this by relaxing bitclk divider searching, so that when
no exact value can be derived from sysclk pick the closest
value greater than expected bitclk.
