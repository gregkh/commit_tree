arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Drop duplicate dp_hot_plug_det node in trogdor

This moved from being trogdor specific to being part of the general
sc7180.dtsi SoC file in commit 681a607ad21a ("arm64: dts: qcom:
sc7180: Add DisplayPort HPD pin dt node"). Then we dropped the pinconf
from the general sc7180.dtsi file in commit 8d079bf20410 ("arm64: dts:
qcom: sc7180: Drop pinconf on dp_hot_plug_det") and added it back to
the trogdor dts file in commit f772081f4883 ("arm64: dts: qcom:
sc7180: Add "dp_hot_plug_det" pinconf for trogdor").

As part of this we managed to forget to drop the old copy in the
trogdor dts. Let's do it now.
