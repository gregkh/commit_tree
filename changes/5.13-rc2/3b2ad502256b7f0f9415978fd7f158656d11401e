selftests/bpf: Add map linking selftest

Add selftest validating various aspects of statically linking BTF-defined map
definitions. Legacy map definitions do not support extern resolution between
object files. Some of the aspects validated:
  - correct resolution of extern maps against concrete map definitions;
  - extern maps can currently only specify map type and key/value size and/or
    type information;
  - weak concrete map definitions are resolved properly.

Static map definitions are not yet supported by libbpf, so they are not
explicitly tested, though manual testing showes that BPF linker handles them
properly.
