soundwire: Intel: add DMI quirk for Dell SKU 0A3E

We've been handling ACPI issues on early versions of the product with
a local ACPI initrd override but now that we have the possibility of a
kernel quirk let's get rid of the initrd override. This helps make
sure that the kernel will support all versions of the BIOS, with or
without updates.
