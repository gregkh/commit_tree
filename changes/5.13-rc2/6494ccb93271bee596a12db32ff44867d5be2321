rcu: Remove spurious instrumentation_end() in rcu_nmi_enter()

In rcu_nmi_enter(), there is an erroneous instrumentation_end() in the
second branch of the "if" statement.  Oddly enough, "objtool check -f
vmlinux.o" fails to complain because it is unable to correctly cover
all cases.  Instead, objtool visits the third branch first, which marks
following trace_rcu_dyntick() as visited.  This commit therefore removes
the spurious instrumentation_end().
