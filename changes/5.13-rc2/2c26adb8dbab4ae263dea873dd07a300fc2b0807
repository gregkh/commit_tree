arm64: dts: qcom: Add sc7180-lazor-limozeen skus

This is a SKU variant of lazor.  Add it.  This squashes the downstream
patches to support this hardware.

NOTES:
- The non-touch SKU actually has "innolux,n116bca-ea1" but that driver
  is still pending in simple-panel.  The bindings have been Acked
  though [1].  Things work well enough with the "innolux,n116bge"
  timings for now, though.
- The wonky special dts just for "-rev4" arguably doesn't need to go
  upstream since they weren't widely distributed, but since a few
  people have them we might as well.  If it ever causes problems we
  can delete it.
