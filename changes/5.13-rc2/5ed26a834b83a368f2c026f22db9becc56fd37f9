ASoC: Intel: soc-acpi: remove TGL RVP mixed SoundWire/TDM config

The TGL RVP can be configured in many ways. We initially supported a
mixed configuration with RT711 in SoundWire mode and RT1308 in
TDM mode.

However Intel teams no longer have any hardware with this
configuration and there are no commercially-available devices using it
either, so let's remove this entry. The corresponding topology will
also be removed from the SOF tree.

This patch partially reverts Commit d985d208bf8f ("ASoC: Intel: common: add match tables for TGL w/ SoundWire")
