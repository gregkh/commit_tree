staging: comedi: tests: ni_routes_test: Fix compilation error

The `ni_routes_test` module is not currently selectable using the
Kconfig files, but can be built by specifying `CONFIG_COMEDI_TESTS=m` on
the "make" command line.  It currently fails to compile due to an extra
parameter added to the `ni_assign_device_routes` function by
commit e3b7ce73c578 ("staging: comedi: ni_routes: Allow alternate board
name for routes").  Fix it by supplying the value `NULL` for the added
`alt_board_name` parameter (which specifies that there is no alternate
board name).
