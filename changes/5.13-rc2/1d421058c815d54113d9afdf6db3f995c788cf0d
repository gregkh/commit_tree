iommu/vt-d: Don't set then clear private data in prq_event_thread()

The VT-d specification (section 7.6) requires that the value in the
Private Data field of a Page Group Response Descriptor must match
the value in the Private Data field of the respective Page Request
Descriptor.

The private data field of a page group response descriptor is set then
immediately cleared in prq_event_thread(). This breaks the rule defined
by the VT-d specification. Fix it by moving clearing code up.
