perf/x86: Hybrid PMU support for counters

The number of GP and fixed counters are different among hybrid PMUs.
Each hybrid PMU should use its own counter related information.

When handling a certain hybrid PMU, apply the number of counters from
the corresponding hybrid PMU.

When reserving the counters in the initialization of a new event,
reserve all possible counters.

The number of counter recored in the global x86_pmu is for the
architecture counters which are available for all hybrid PMUs. KVM
doesn't support the hybrid PMU yet. Return the number of the
architecture counters for now.

For the functions only available for the old platforms, e.g.,
intel_pmu_drain_pebs_nhm(), nothing is changed.
