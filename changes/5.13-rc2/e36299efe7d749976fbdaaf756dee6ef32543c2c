kcsan, debugfs: Move debugfs file creation out of early init

Commit 56348560d495 ("debugfs: do not attempt to create a new file
before the filesystem is initalized") forbids creating new debugfs files
until debugfs is fully initialized.  This means that KCSAN's debugfs
file creation, which happened at the end of __init(), no longer works.
And was apparently never supposed to work!

However, there is no reason to create KCSAN's debugfs file so early.
This commit therefore moves its creation to a late_initcall() callback.
