tools headers UAPI: Sync files changed by landlock, quotactl_path and mount_settattr new syscalls

To pick the changes in these csets:

  a49f4f81cb48925e ("arch: Wire up Landlock syscalls")
  2a1867219c7b27f9 ("fs: add mount_setattr()")
  fa8b90070a80bb1a ("quota: wire up quotactl_path")

That silences these perf build warnings and add support for those new
syscalls in tools such as 'perf trace'.

For instance, this is now possible:

  # ~acme/bin/perf trace -v -e landlock*
  event qualifier tracepoint filter: (common_pid != 129365 && common_pid != 3502) && (id == 444 || id == 445 || id == 446)
  ^C#

That is tha filter expression attached to the raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit}
tracepoints.

  $ grep landlock tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
  444	common	landlock_create_ruleset	sys_landlock_create_ruleset
  445	common	landlock_add_rule	sys_landlock_add_rule
  446	common	landlock_restrict_self	sys_landlock_restrict_self
  $

This addresses these perf build warnings:
