samples: bpf: Do not unload prog within xdpsock

With the introduction of bpf_link in xsk's libbpf part, there's no
further need for explicit unload of prog on xdpsock's termination. When
process dies, the bpf_link's refcount will be decremented and resources
will be unloaded/freed under the hood in case when there are no more
active users.

While at it, don't dump stats on error path.
