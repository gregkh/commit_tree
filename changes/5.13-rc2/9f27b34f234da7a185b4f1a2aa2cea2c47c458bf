mm,hugetlb: drop clearing of flag from prep_new_huge_page

Pages allocated via the page allocator or CMA get its private field
cleared by means of post_alloc_hook().

Pages allocated during boot, that is directly from the memblock
allocator, get cleared by paging_init()-> ..  ->memmap_init_zone-> ..
->__init_single_page() before any memblock allocation.

Based on this ground, let us remove the clearing of the flag from
prep_new_huge_page() as it is not needed.  This was a leftover from
commit 6c0371490140 ("hugetlb: convert PageHugeFreed to HPageFreed
flag").

Previously the explicit clearing was necessary because compound
allocations do not get this initialization (see prep_compound_page).
