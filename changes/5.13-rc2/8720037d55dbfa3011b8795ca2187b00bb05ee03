serial: extend compile-test coverage

Allow more drivers to be compile tested more easily, for example, when
doing subsystem-wide changes.

Verified on X86_64 as well as arm, powerpc and m68k with minimal configs
in order to catch missing implicit build dependencies (e.g. MAILBOX for
SERIAL_TEGRA_TCU).
