PCI: Add pci_disable_parity()

Add pci_disable_parity() to disable reporting of parity errors for a
device by clearing PCI_COMMAND_PARITY.

The device will still set PCI_STATUS_DETECTED_PARITY when it detects
a parity error or receives a Poisoned TLP, but it will not set
PCI_STATUS_PARITY, which means it will not assert PERR#
(conventional PCI) or report Poisoned TLPs (PCIe).
