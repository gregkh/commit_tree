pinctrl: pinctrl-single: fix pcs_pin_dbg_show() when bits_per_mux is not zero

A System Error (SError, followed by kernel panic) was detected when
trying to print the supported pins in a pinctrl device which supports
multiple pins per register. This change fixes the pcs_pin_dbg_show() in
pinctrl-single driver when bits_per_mux is not zero. In addition move
offset calculation and pin offset in register to common function.
