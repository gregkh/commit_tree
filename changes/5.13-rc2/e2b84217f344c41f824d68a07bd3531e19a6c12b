btrfs: update outdated comment at btrfs_replace_file_extents()

There is a comment at btrfs_replace_file_extents() that mentions that we
set the full sync flag on an inode when cloning into a file with a size
greater than or equals to 16MiB, through try_release_extent_mapping() when
we truncate the page cache after replacing file extents during a clone
operation.

That is not true anymore since commit 5e548b32018d96 ("btrfs: do not set
the full sync flag on the inode during page release"), so update the
comment to remove that part and rephrase it slightly to make it more
clear why the full sync flag is set at btrfs_replace_file_extents().
