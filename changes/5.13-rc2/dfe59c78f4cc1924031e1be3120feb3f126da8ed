media: staging: atomisp: Corrected error handling in function

This patch fixes check of a result of 'power_up()' function call in
function 'gc0310_s_power()' to do "error handling" instead of "success
handling" as Dan Carpenter noted in his comment on the previous patch.
Lines 'return gc0310_init(sd)' and 'return ret' are swapped, and direct
value of 'ret' is checked in IF statement now.
