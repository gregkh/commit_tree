xfs: move the xfs_can_free_eofblocks call under the IOLOCK

In xfs_inode_free_eofblocks, move the xfs_can_free_eofblocks call
further down in the function to the point where we have taken the
IOLOCK.  This is preparation for the next patch, where we will need that
lock (or equivalent) so that we can check if there are any post-eof
blocks to clean out.
