lockdep: Add lockdep lock state defines

Adds defines for lock state returns from lock_is_held_type() based on
Johannes Berg's suggestions as it make it easier to read and maintain
the lock states. These are defines and a enum to avoid changes to
lock_is_held_type() and lockdep_is_held() return types.

Updates to lock_is_held_type() and  __lock_is_held() to use the new
defines.
