md: Fix missing unused status line of /proc/mdstat

Reading /proc/mdstat with a read buffer size that would not
fit the unused status line in the first read will skip this
line from the output.

So 'dd if=/proc/mdstat bs=64 2>/dev/null' will not print something
like: unused devices: <none>

Don't return NULL immediately in start() for v=2 but call
show() once to print the status line also for multiple reads.
