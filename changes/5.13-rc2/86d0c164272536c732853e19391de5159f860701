mm/ioremap: fix iomap_max_page_shift

iomap_max_page_shift is expected to contain a page shift, so it can't be a
'bool', has to be an 'unsigned int'

And fix the default values: P4D_SHIFT is when huge iomap is allowed.

However, on some architectures (eg: powerpc book3s/64), P4D_SHIFT is not a
constant so it can't be used to initialise a static variable.  So,
initialise iomap_max_page_shift with a maximum shift supported by the
architecture, it is gated by P4D_SHIFT in vmap_try_huge_p4d() anyway.
