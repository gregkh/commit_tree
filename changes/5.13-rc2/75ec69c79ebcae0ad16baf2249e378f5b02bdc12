drm/vmwgfx: Fix some memory leaks on errors

Dan noticed some issues with pci_release_region, this builds upon
that and fixes some other lingering issues. As part of this we
also can stop trying to manually free our managed device;
there's no need for it, it will be cleaned up automatically for us.
