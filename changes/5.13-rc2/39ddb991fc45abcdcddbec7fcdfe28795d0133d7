mm, page_alloc: avoid page_to_pfn() in move_freepages()

The start_pfn and end_pfn are already available in move_freepages_block(),
there is no need to go back and forth between page and pfn in
move_freepages and move_freepages_block, and pfn_valid_within() should
validate pfn first before touching the page.
