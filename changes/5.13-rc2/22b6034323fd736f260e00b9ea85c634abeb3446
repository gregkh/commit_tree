net, xdp: Update pkt_type if generic XDP changes unicast MAC

If a generic XDP program changes the destination MAC address from/to
multicast/broadcast, the skb->pkt_type is updated to properly handle
the packet when passed up the stack. When changing the MAC from/to
the NICs MAC, PACKET_HOST/OTHERHOST is not updated, though, making
the behavior different from that of native XDP.

Remember the PACKET_HOST/OTHERHOST state before calling the program
in generic XDP, and update pkt_type accordingly if the destination
MAC address has changed. As eth_type_trans() assumes a default
pkt_type of PACKET_HOST, restore that before calling it.

The use case for this is when a XDP program wants to push received
packets up the stack by rewriting the MAC to the NICs MAC, for
example by cluster nodes sharing MAC addresses.
