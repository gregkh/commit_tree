powerpc/32: Enable instruction translation at the same time as data translation

On 40x and 8xx, kernel text is pinned.
On book3s/32, kernel text is mapped by BATs.

Enable instruction translation at the same time as data translation, it
makes things simpler.

In syscall handler, MSR_RI can also be set at the same time because
srr0/srr1 are already saved and r1 is set properly.

On booke, translation is always on, so at the end all PPC32
have translation on early. Just update msr.

Also update comment in power_save_ppc32_restore().
