x86/paravirt: Switch functions with custom code to ALTERNATIVE

Instead of using paravirt patching for custom code sequences use
ALTERNATIVE for the functions with custom code replacements.

Instead of patching an ud2 instruction for unpopulated vector entries
into the caller site, use a simple function just calling BUG() as a
replacement.

Simplify the register defines for assembler paravirt calling, as there
isn't much usage left.
