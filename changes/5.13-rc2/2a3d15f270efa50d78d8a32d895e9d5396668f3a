vfio/mdev: Add missing typesafety around mdev_device

The mdev API should accept and pass a 'struct mdev_device *' in all
places, not pass a 'struct device *' and cast it internally with
to_mdev_device(). Particularly in its struct mdev_driver functions, the
whole point of a bus's struct device_driver wrapper is to provide type
safety compared to the default struct device_driver.

Further, the driver core standard is for bus drivers to expose their
device structure in their public headers that can be used with
container_of() inlines and '&foo->dev' to go between the class levels, and
'&foo->dev' to be used with dev_err/etc driver core helper functions. Move
'struct mdev_device' to mdev.h

Once done this allows moving some one instruction exported functions to
static inlines, which in turns allows removing one of the two grotesque
symbol_get()'s related to mdev in the core code.
