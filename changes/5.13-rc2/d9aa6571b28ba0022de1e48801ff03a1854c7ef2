drm/msm/dp: check sink_count before update is_connected status

Link status is different from display connected status in the case
of something like an Apple dongle where the type-c plug can be
connected, and therefore the link is connected, but no sink is
connected until an HDMI cable is plugged into the dongle.
The sink_count of DPCD of dongle will increase to 1 once an HDMI
cable is plugged into the dongle so that display connected status
will become true. This checking also apply at pm_resume.

Changes in v4:
-- none
