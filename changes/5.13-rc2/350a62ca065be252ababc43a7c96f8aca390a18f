bpf: Document the pahole release info related to libbpf in bpf_devel_QA.rst

pahole starts to use libbpf definitions and APIs since v1.13 after the
commit 21507cd3e97b ("pahole: add libbpf as submodule under lib/bpf").
It works well with the git repository because the libbpf submodule will
use "git submodule update --init --recursive" to update.

Unfortunately, the default github release source code does not contain
libbpf submodule source code and this will cause build issues, the tarball
from https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/pahole/pahole.git/ is same with
github, you can get the source tarball with corresponding libbpf submodule
codes from

https://fedorapeople.org/~acme/dwarves

This change documents the above issues to give more information so that
we can get the tarball from the right place, early discussion is here:
