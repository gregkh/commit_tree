psample: Encapsulate packet metadata in a struct

Currently, callers of psample_sample_packet() pass three metadata
attributes: Ingress port, egress port and truncated size. Subsequent
patches are going to add more attributes (e.g., egress queue occupancy),
which also need an indication whether they are valid or not.

Encapsulate packet metadata in a struct in order to keep the number of
arguments reasonable.
