um: synchronize kmsg_dumper

The kmsg_dumper can be called from any context and CPU, possibly
from multiple CPUs simultaneously. Since a static buffer is used
to retrieve the kernel logs, this buffer must be protected against
simultaneous dumping. Skip dumping if another context is already
dumping.
