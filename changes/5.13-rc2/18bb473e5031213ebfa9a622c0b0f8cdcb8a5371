mm: vmscan: shrink deferred objects proportional to priority

The number of deferred objects might get windup to an absurd number, and
it results in clamp of slab objects.  It is undesirable for sustaining
workingset.

So shrink deferred objects proportional to priority and cap nr_deferred
to twice of cache items.

The idea is borrowed from Dave Chinner's patch:
  https://lore.kernel.org/linux-xfs/20191031234618.15403-13-david@fromorbit.com/

Tested with kernel build and vfs metadata heavy workload in our
production environment, no regression is spotted so far.
