KVM: nSVM: fix few bugs in the vmcb02 caching logic

* Define and use an invalid GPA (all ones) for init value of last
  and current nested vmcb physical addresses.

* Reset the current vmcb12 gpa to the invalid value when leaving
  the nested mode, similar to what is done on nested vmexit.

* Reset	the last seen vmcb12 address when disabling the nested SVM,
  as it relies on vmcb02 fields which are freed at that point.
