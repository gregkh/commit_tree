kasan, arm64: tests supports for HW_TAGS async mode

This change adds KASAN-KUnit tests support for the async HW_TAGS mode.

In async mode, tag fault aren't being generated synchronously when a
bad access happens, but are instead explicitly checked for by the kernel.

As each KASAN-KUnit test expect a fault to happen before the test is over,
check for faults as a part of the test handler.
