printk: use seqcount_latch for clear_seq

kmsg_dump_rewind_nolock() locklessly reads @clear_seq. However,
this is not done atomically. Since @clear_seq is 64-bit, this
cannot be an atomic operation for all platforms. Therefore, use
a seqcount_latch to allow readers to always read a consistent
value.
