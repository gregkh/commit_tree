selftests: net: mirror_gre_vlan_bridge_1q: Make an FDB entry static

The FDB roaming test installs a destination MAC address on the wrong
interface of an FDB database and tests whether the mirroring fails, because
packets are sent to the wrong port. The test by mistake installs the FDB
entry as local. This worked previously, because drivers were notified of
local FDB entries in the same way as of static entries. However that has
been fixed in the commit 6ab4c3117aec ("net: bridge: don't notify switchdev
for local FDB addresses"), and local entries are not notified anymore. As a
result, the HW is not reconfigured for the FDB roam, and mirroring keeps
working, failing the test.

To fix the issue, mark the FDB entry as static.
