can: add new CAN FD bittiming parameters: Transmitter Delay Compensation (TDC)

At high bit rates, the propagation delay from the TX pin to the RX pin
of the transceiver causes measurement errors: the sample point on the
RX pin might occur on the previous bit.

This issue is addressed in ISO 11898-1 section 11.3.3 "Transmitter
delay compensation" (TDC).

This patch adds two new structures: can_tdc and can_tdc_const in order
to implement this TDC.

The structures are then added to can_priv.

A controller supports TDC if an only if can_priv::tdc_const is not
NULL.

TDC is active if and only if:
  - fd flag is on
  - can_priv::tdc.tdco is not zero.
It is the driver responsibility to check those two conditions are met.

No new controller modes are introduced (i.e. no CAN_CTRL_MODE_TDC) in
order not to be redundant with above logic.

The names of the parameters are chosen to match existing CAN
controllers specification. References:
