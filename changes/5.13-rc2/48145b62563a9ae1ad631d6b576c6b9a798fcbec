nvme: fix controller ioctl through ns_head

In multipath case, we should consider namespace attachment with
controllers in a subsystem when we find out the live controller for the
namespace.  This patch manually reverted the commit 3557a4409701
("nvme: don't bother to look up a namespace for controller ioctls") with
few more updates to nvme_ns_head_chr_ioctl which has been newly updated.

controller ioctls")
