KVM: arm/arm64: Fix KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST read

When reading the base address of the a REDIST region
through KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST we expect the
redistributor region list to be populated with a single
element.

However list_first_entry() expects the list to be non empty.
Instead we should use list_first_entry_or_null which effectively
returns NULL if the list is empty.
