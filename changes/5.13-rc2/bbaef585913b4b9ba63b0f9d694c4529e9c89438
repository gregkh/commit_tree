drm/amd/display: Copy over soc values before bounding box creation

[Why]
With certain fclock overclocks, state 1 may be chosen
as the closest clock level. This may result in this state
being empty if not populated beforehand, resulting in
black screens and screen corruption.

[How]
Copy over all soc states to clock_limits before bounding
box creation to avoid any cases with empty states.
