btrfs: update outdated comment at btrfs_orphan_cleanup()

btrfs_orphan_cleanup() has a comment referring to find_dead_roots, but
function does not exists since commit cb517eabba4f10 ("Btrfs: cleanup the
similar code of the fs root read"). What we use now to find and load dead
roots is btrfs_find_orphan_roots(). So update the comment and make it a
bit more detailed about why we can not delete an orphan item for a root.
