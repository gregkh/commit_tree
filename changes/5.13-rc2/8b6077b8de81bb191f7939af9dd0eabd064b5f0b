MAINTAINERS: update MELLANOX HARDWARE PLATFORM SUPPORT maintainers

The "MELLANOX HARDWARE PLATFORM SUPPORT" is maintained as part of the
pdx86 tree. But when Mark and I took over as new pdx86 maintainers the
"MELLANOX HARDWARE PLATFORM SUPPORT" MAINTAINERS entry was not updated.

Update the entry now.
