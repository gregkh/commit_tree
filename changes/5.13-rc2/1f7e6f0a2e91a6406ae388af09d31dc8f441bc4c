staging: rtl8723bs: remove commented RT_TRACE calls in core/rtw_mlme.c

Remove commented RT_TRACE calls in core/rtw_mlme.c

Remove all of the RT_TRACE logs in the core/rtw_mlme.c file as they
currently do nothing as they require the code to be modified by
hand in order to be turned on. This obviously has not happened
since the code was merged. Moreover it relies on an unneeded
private log level tracing which overrides the in-kernel public one,
so just remove them as they are unused.
