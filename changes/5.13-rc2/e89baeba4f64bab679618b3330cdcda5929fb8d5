usb: dwc2: Remove obsolete MODULE_ constants from platform.c

Originally, the core and platform drivers were separate modules, so each
had its own module info. Since commit 2d1165a4b95e (usb: dwc2: remove
dwc2_platform.ko) platform.c is included in the core module, which now
contains duplicate module info (from core.c and platform.c).

Due to the linking order and modinfo implementation, running `modinfo`
on the resulting dwc2.ko shows just the info from platform.c, rather
than that from core.c, suggesting that I am the author of the entire
dwc2 module. Since platform.c is just a minor part of the entire module,
this removes its module info in favor of the info from core.c.
