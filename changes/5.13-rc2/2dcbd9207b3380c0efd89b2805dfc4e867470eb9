mlxsw: spectrum_span: Add SPAN probability rate support

Currently, every packet that matches a mirroring trigger (e.g., received
packets, buffer dropped packets) is mirrored. Spectrum-2 and later ASICs
support mirroring with probability, where every 1 in N matched packets
is mirrored.

Extend the API that creates the binding between the trigger and the SPAN
agent with a probability rate parameter, which is an attribute of the
trigger. Set it to '1' to maintain existing behavior.

Subsequent patches will use it to perform more sophisticated sampling,
by mirroring packets to the CPU with probability.
