misc/pvpanic: split-up generic and platform dependent code

Split-up generic and platform dependent code in order to be able to re-use
generic event handling code in pvpanic PCI device driver in the next patches.

The code from pvpanic.c was split in two new files:
- pvpanic.c: generic code that handles pvpanic events
- pvpanic-mmio.c: platform/bus dependent code
