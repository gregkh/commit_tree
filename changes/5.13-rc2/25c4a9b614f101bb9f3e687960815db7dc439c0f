ASoC: simple-card: Fix breakage on kontron-sl28-var3-ads2

A KernelCI bisection identified 59c35c44a9cf89 "ASoC: simple-card: add
simple_parse_node()" as causing simple-card to fail to instantiate on
kontron-sl28-var3-ads2 systems.  Since the merge window is expected to
open over the weekend drop that commit and subsequent ones which depend
on it for now in case other systems are affected too.

The boot log showed the error as:

<4>[    9.948821] sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/platform/sound/(null)-wm8904-hifi'

(backtrace)

<3>[   10.191982] kobject_add_internal failed for (null)-wm8904-hifi with -EEXIST, don't try to register things with the same name in the same directory.

The dropped commits are:

73371bacf0475a20ab6 "ASoC: audio-graph: tidyup graph_dai_link_of_dpcm()"
434392271afcff350fe "ASoC: simple-card: add simple_link_init()"
