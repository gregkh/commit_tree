arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: fix display nodes

Apply these fixes to the newly added sm8250 display ndoes
 - Remove "notused" interconnect (which apparently was blindly copied from
   my old patches)
 - Use dispcc node example from dt-bindings, removing clocks which aren't
   documented or used by the driver and fixing the region size.
