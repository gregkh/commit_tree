scsi: core: Introduce enum scsi_disposition

Improve readability of the code in the SCSI core by introducing an
enumeration type for the values used internally that decide how to continue
processing a SCSI command. The eh_*_handler return values have not been
changed because that would involve modifying all SCSI drivers.

The output of the following command has been inspected to verify that no
out-of-range values are assigned to a variable of type enum
scsi_disposition:

KCFLAGS=-Wassign-enum make CC=clang W=1 drivers/scsi/
