drm/radeon/dpm: Disable sclk switching on Oland when two 4K 60Hz monitors are connected

Screen flickers rapidly when two 4K 60Hz monitors are in use. This issue
doesn't happen when one monitor is 4K 60Hz (pixelclock 594MHz) and
another one is 4K 30Hz (pixelclock 297MHz).

The issue is gone after setting "power_dpm_force_performance_level" to
"high". Following the indication, we found that the issue occurs when
sclk is too low.

So resolve the issue by disabling sclk switching when there are two
monitors requires high pixelclock (> 297MHz).

v2:
 - Only apply the fix to Oland.
