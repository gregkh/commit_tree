md: md_open returns -EBUSY when entering racing area

commit d3374825ce57 ("md: make devices disappear when they are no longer
needed.") introduced protection between mddev creating & removing. The
md_open shouldn't create mddev when all_mddevs list doesn't contain
mddev. With currently code logic, there will be very easy to trigger
soft lockup in non-preempt env.

This patch changes md_open returning from -ERESTARTSYS to -EBUSY, which
will break the infinitely retry when md_open enter racing area.

This patch is partly fix soft lockup issue, full fix needs mddev_find
is split into two functions: mddev_find & mddev_find_or_alloc. And
md_open should call new mddev_find (it only does searching job).

For more detail, please refer with Christoph's "split mddev_find" patch
in later commits.

*** env ***
kvm-qemu VM 2C1G with 2 iscsi luns
kernel should be non-preempt

*** script ***

about trigger every time with below script

```
1  node1="mdcluster1"
2  node2="mdcluster2"
3
4  mdadm -Ss
5  ssh ${node2} "mdadm -Ss"
6  wipefs -a /dev/sda /dev/sdb
7  mdadm -CR /dev/md0 -b clustered -e 1.2 -n 2 -l mirror /dev/sda \
   /dev/sdb --assume-clean
8
9  for i in {1..10}; do
10    echo ==== $i ====;
11
12    echo "test  ...."
13    ssh ${node2} "mdadm -A /dev/md0 /dev/sda /dev/sdb"
14    sleep 1
15
16    echo "clean  ....."
17    ssh ${node2} "mdadm -Ss"
18 done
```

I use mdcluster env to trigger soft lockup, but it isn't mdcluster
speical bug. To stop md array in mdcluster env will do more jobs than
non-cluster array, which will leave enough time/gap to allow kernel to
run md_open.

*** rootcause ***

"mdadm -A" (or other array assemble commands) will start a daemon "mdadm
--monitor" by default. When "mdadm -Ss" is running, the stop action will
wakeup "mdadm --monitor". The "--monitor" daemon will immediately get
info from /proc/mdstat. This time mddev in kernel still exist, so
/proc/mdstat still show md device, which makes "mdadm --monitor" to open
/dev/md0.

The previously "mdadm -Ss" is removing action, the "mdadm --monitor"
open action will trigger md_open which is creating action. Racing is
happening.

```
<thread 1>: "mdadm -Ss"
md_release
  mddev_put deletes mddev from all_mddevs
  queue_work for mddev_delayed_delete
  at this time, "/dev/md0" is still available for opening

<thread 2>: "mdadm --monitor ..."
md_open
 + mddev_find can't find mddev of /dev/md0, and create a new mddev and
 |    return.
 + trigger "if (mddev->gendisk != bdev->bd_disk)" and return
      -ERESTARTSYS.
```

In non-preempt kernel, <thread 2> is occupying on current CPU. and
mddev_delayed_delete which was created in <thread 1> also can't be
schedule.

In preempt kernel, it can also trigger above racing. But kernel doesn't
allow one thread running on a CPU all the time. after <thread 2> running
some time, the later "mdadm -A" (refer above script line 13) will call
md_alloc to alloc a new gendisk for mddev. it will break md_open
statement "if (mddev->gendisk != bdev->bd_disk)" and return 0 to caller,
the soft lockup is broken.
