KVM: x86: Tie Intel and AMD behavior for MSR_TSC_AUX to guest CPU model

Squish the Intel and AMD emulation of MSR_TSC_AUX together and tie it to
the guest CPU model instead of the host CPU behavior.  While not strictly
necessary to avoid guest breakage, emulating cross-vendor "architecture"
will provide consistent behavior for the guest, e.g. WRMSR fault behavior
won't change if the vCPU is migrated to a host with divergent behavior.

Note, the "new" kvm_is_supported_user_return_msr() checks do not add new
functionality on either SVM or VMX.  On SVM, the equivalent was
"tsc_aux_uret_slot < 0", and on VMX the check was buried in the
vmx_find_uret_msr() call at the find_uret_msr label.
