media: staging: ipu3: uapi: Add "WITH Linux-syscall-note" license

All Linux headers licensed under the GPL-2.0 must include a "WITH
Linux-syscall-note" extension in their SPDX license identifier, as
enforced by the scripts/headers_install.sh script. Fix the Intel IPU3
UAPI header currently stored with the driver in staging.
