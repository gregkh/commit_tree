drm: Refuse to create zero width/height cmdline modes

If the user specifies zero width/height cmdline mode i915 will
blow up as the fbdev path will bypass the regular fb sanity
check that would otherwise have refused to create a framebuffer
with zero width/height.

The reason I thought to try this is so that I can force a specific
depth for fbdev without actually having to hardcode the mode
on the kernel cmdline. Eg. if I pass video=0x0-8 I will get an
8bpp framebuffer at my monitor's native resolution.
