arm64: dts: ti: k3-j7200: Add support for higher speed modes and update delay select values for MMCSD subsystems

The following speed modes are now supported in J7200 SoC,
- HS200 and HS400 modes at 1.8 V card voltage, in MMCSD0 subsystem [1].
- UHS-I speed modes in MMCSD1 subsystem [1].

Add support for UHS-I modes by adding voltage regulator device tree nodes
and corresponding pinmux details, to power cycle and voltage switch cards.
Set respective tags in sdhci0 and remove no-1-8-v tag from sdhci1
device tree nodes.

Also update the delay values for various speed modes supported, based on
the revised january 2021 J7200 datasheet[2].
