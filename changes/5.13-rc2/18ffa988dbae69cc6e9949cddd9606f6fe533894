usb: dwc3: gadget: Return success always for kick transfer in ep queue

If an error is received when issuing a start or update transfer
command, the error handler will stop all active requests (including
the current USB request), and call dwc3_gadget_giveback() to notify
function drivers of the requests which have been stopped.  Avoid
returning an error for kick transfer during EP queue, to remove
duplicate cleanup operations on the request being queued.
