drm/i915/audio: set HDA link parameters in driver

Update logic to program AUD_FREQ_CNTRL register based on new guidance.
Earlier this register was configured by BIOS and driver discovered the
value at init. This is no longer recommended and instead driver should
set the values based on the hardware revision.

Add the recommended values for all supported hardware. This change applies
for all GEN12+ hardware. For TGL, some special case handling is needed
to not break existing systems.

Extend the debug print to also include values of the register as written
by BIOS. This can help debug rare cases where BIOS has configured the link
settings to incorrect values.
