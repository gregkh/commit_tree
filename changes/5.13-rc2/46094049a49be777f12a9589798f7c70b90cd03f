Revert "mtd: spi-nor: macronix: Add support for mx25l51245g"

This reverts commit 04b8edad262eec0d153005973dfbdd83423c0dcb.

mx25l51245g and mx66l51235l have the same flash ID. The flash
detection returns the first entry in the flash_info array that
matches the flash ID that was read, thus for the 0xc2201a ID,
mx25l51245g was always hit, introducing a regression for
mx66l51235l.

If one wants to differentiate the flash names, a better fix would be
to differentiate between the two at run-time, depending on SFDP,
and choose the correct name from a list of flash names, depending on
the SFDP differentiator.
