drm/i915: Avoid div-by-zero on gen2

Gen2 tiles are 2KiB in size so i915_gem_object_get_tile_row_size()
can in fact return <4KiB, which leads to div-by-zero here.
Avoid that.

Not sure i915_gem_object_get_tile_row_size() is entirely
sane anyway since it doesn't account for the different tile
layouts on i8xx/i915...

I'm not able to hit this before commit 6846895fde05 ("drm/i915:
Replace PIN_NONFAULT with calls to PIN_NOEVICT") and it looks
like I also need to run recent version of Mesa. With those in
place xonotic trips on this quite easily on my 85x.
