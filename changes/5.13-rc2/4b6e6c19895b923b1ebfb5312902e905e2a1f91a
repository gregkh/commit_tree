pinctrl: renesas: Move R-Car bias helpers to sh_pfc.h

The Renesas Pin Function Controller driver uses two header files:
  - sh_pfc.h, for use by both core code and SoC-specific drivers,
  - core.h, for internal use by the core code only.

Hence move the R-Car bias helper declarations from core.h to sh_pfc.h,
and drop the inclusion of core.h from SoC-specific drivers that no
longer need it.
