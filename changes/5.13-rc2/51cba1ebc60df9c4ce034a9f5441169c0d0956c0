init_on_alloc: Optimize static branches

The state of CONFIG_INIT_ON_ALLOC_DEFAULT_ON (and ...ON_FREE...) did not
change the assembly ordering of the static branches: they were always out
of line. Use the new jump_label macros to check the CONFIG settings to
default to the "expected" state, which slightly optimizes the resulting
assembly code.
