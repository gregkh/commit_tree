hpfs: replace one-element array with flexible-array member

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Also, this helps with the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds by
fixing the following warning:

  CC [M]  fs/hpfs/dir.o
fs/hpfs/dir.c: In function `hpfs_readdir':
fs/hpfs/dir.c:163:41: warning: array subscript 1 is above array bounds of `u8[1]' {aka `unsigned char[1]'} [-Warray-bounds]
  163 |         || de ->name[0] != 1 || de->name[1] != 1))
      |                                 ~~~~~~~~^~~
