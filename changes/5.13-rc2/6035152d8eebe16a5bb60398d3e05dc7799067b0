x86/mm/tlb: Open-code on_each_cpu_cond_mask() for tlb_is_not_lazy()

Open-code on_each_cpu_cond_mask() in native_flush_tlb_others() to
optimize the code. Open-coding eliminates the need for the indirect branch
that is used to call is_lazy(), and in CPUs that are vulnerable to
Spectre v2, it eliminates the retpoline. In addition, it allows to use a
preallocated cpumask to compute the CPUs that should be.

This would later allow us not to adapt on_each_cpu_cond_mask() to
support local and remote functions.

Note that calling tlb_is_not_lazy() for every CPU that needs to be
flushed, as done in native_flush_tlb_multi() might look ugly, but it is
equivalent to what is currently done in on_each_cpu_cond_mask().
Actually, native_flush_tlb_multi() does it more efficiently since it
avoids using an indirect branch for the matter.
