powerpc/uaccess: Call might_fault() inconditionaly

Commit 6bfd93c32a50 ("powerpc: Fix incorrect might_sleep in
__get_user/__put_user on kernel addresses") added a check to not call
might_sleep() on kernel addresses. This was to enable the use of
__get_user() in the alignment exception handler for any address.

Then commit 95156f0051cb ("lockdep, mm: fix might_fault() annotation")
added a check of the address space in might_fault(), based on
set_fs() logic. But this didn't solve the powerpc alignment exception
case as it didn't call set_fs(KERNEL_DS).

Nowadays, set_fs() is gone, previous patch fixed the alignment
exception handler and __get_user/__put_user are not supposed to be
used anymore to read kernel memory.

Therefore the is_kernel_addr() check has become useless and can be
removed.
