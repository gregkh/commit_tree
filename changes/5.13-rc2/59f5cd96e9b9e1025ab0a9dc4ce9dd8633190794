ASoC: simple-card-utils: setup dai_props cpu_dai/codec_dai at initial timing

We couldn't setup dai_props cpu_dai/codec_dai at the initial timing,
because "counting DAIs loop" and "detecting DAIs loop" were different.
But we can do it now, because these are using same loops.

This patch setups dai_props cpu_dai/codec_dai at the initial timing.
It can removes triky code from simple-card / audio-graph.
