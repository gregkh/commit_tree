media: imx: capture: Initialize video_device programmatically

Overwriting the whole video_device isn't future-proof as it would
overwrite any field initialized by video_device_alloc(). Furthermore,
the current implementation modifies the global template video_device as
if it were a per-instance structure, which is bad practice. To fix all
this, initialize the video device programmatically in
imx_media_capture_device_init().
