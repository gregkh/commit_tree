powerpc/32: Add a prepare_transfer_to_handler macro for exception prologs

In order to increase flexibility, add a macro that will for now
call transfer_to_handler.

As transfer_to_handler doesn't do the actual transfer anymore,
also name it prepare_transfer_to_handler. The following patches
will progressively remove the use of transfer_to_handler label.
