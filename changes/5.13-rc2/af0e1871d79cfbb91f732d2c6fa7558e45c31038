iio: tsl2583: Fix division by a zero lux_val

The lux_val returned from tsl2583_get_lux can potentially be zero,
so check for this to avoid a division by zero and an overflowed
gain_trim_val.

Fixes clang scan-build warning:

drivers/iio/light/tsl2583.c:345:40: warning: Either the
condition 'lux_val<0' is redundant or there is division
by zero at line 345. [zerodivcond]
