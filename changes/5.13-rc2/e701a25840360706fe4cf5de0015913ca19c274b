net: thunderx: Fix unintentional sign extension issue

The shifting of the u8 integers rq->caching by 26 bits to
the left will be promoted to a 32 bit signed int and then
sign-extended to a u64. In the event that rq->caching is
greater than 0x1f then all then all the upper 32 bits of
the u64 end up as also being set because of the int
sign-extension. Fix this by casting the u8 values to a
u64 before the 26 bit left shift.
