drm/i915/gt: Replace 'return' with a fall-through

Checkpatch worries that the 'return' before an else clause might be
redundant. In this case, it is avoiding hitting the MISSING_CASE()
warning. Let us appease checkpatch by falling through to the end of the
function, which typically means that we then clean up the unused
wa_list.
