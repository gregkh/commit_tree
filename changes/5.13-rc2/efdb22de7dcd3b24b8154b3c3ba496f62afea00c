bpf: Factor out visit_func_call_insn() in check_cfg()

During verifier check_cfg(), all instructions are
visited to ensure verifier can handle program control flows.
This patch factored out function visit_func_call_insn()
so it can be reused in later patch to visit callback function
calls. There is no functionality change for this patch.
