drivers/perf: hisi: Add new functions for L3C PMU

On HiSilicon Hip09 platform, some new functions are enhanced on L3C PMU:

* tt_req: it is the abbreviation of tracetag request and allows user to
count only read/write/atomic operations. tt_req is 3-bit and details are
listed in the hisi-pmu document.
$# perf stat -a -e hisi_sccl3_l3c0/config=0x02,tt_req=0x4/ sleep 5

* tt_core: it is the abbreviation of tracetag core and allows user to
filter by core/thread within the cluster, it is a 8-bit bitmap that each
bit represents the corresponding core/thread in this L3C.
$# perf stat -a -e hisi_sccl3_l3c0/config=0x02,tt_core=0xf/ sleep 5

* datasrc_cfg: it is the abbreviation of data source configuration and
allows user to check where the data comes from, such as: from local DDR,
cross-die DDR or cross-socket DDR. Its is 5-bit and represents different
data source in the SoC.
$# perf stat -a -e hisi_sccl3_l3c0/dat_access,datasrc_cfg=0xe/ sleep 5

* datasrc_skt: it is the abbreviation of data source from another socket
and is used in the multi-chips, if user wants to check the cross-socket
datat source, it shall be added in perf command. Only one bit is used to
control this.
$# perf stat -a -e hisi_sccl3_l3c0/dat_access,datasrc_cfg=0x10,datasrc_skt=1/ sleep 5
