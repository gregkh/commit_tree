soundwire: qcom: add support to new interrupts

Add support to new interrupts which includes reporting some of the
error interrupts and adding support to SLAVE pending interrupt!

This patch also changes the interrupt handler behaviour on handling
any pending interrupts by checking it before returning out of irq handler.
