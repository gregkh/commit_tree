ACPI: NFIT: Fix support for variable 'SPA' structure size

ACPI 6.4 introduced the "SpaLocationCookie" to the NFIT "System Physical
Address (SPA) Range Structure". The presence of that new field is
indicated by the ACPI_NFIT_LOCATION_COOKIE_VALID flag. Pre-ACPI-6.4
firmware implementations omit the flag and maintain the original size of
the structure.

Update the implementation to check that flag to determine the size
rather than the ACPI 6.4 compliant definition of 'struct
acpi_nfit_system_address' from the Linux ACPICA definitions.

Update the test infrastructure for the new expectations as well, i.e.
continue to emulate the ACPI 6.3 definition of that structure.

Without this fix the kernel fails to validate 'SPA' structures and this
leads to a crash in nfit_get_smbios_id() since that routine assumes that
SPAs are valid if it finds valid SMBIOS tables.
