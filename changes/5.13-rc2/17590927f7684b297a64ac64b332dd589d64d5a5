platform/surface: aggregator_registry: Add battery subsystem devices

Add battery subsystem (TC=0x02) devices (battery and AC) to the SSAM
device registry. These devices need to be registered for 7th-generation
Surface models. On 5th- and 6th-generation models, these devices are
handled via the standard ACPI battery/AC interface, which in turn
accesses the same SSAM interface via the Surface ACPI Notify (SAN)
driver.
