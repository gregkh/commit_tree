arm64: mte: initialize RGSR_EL1.SEED in __cpu_setup

A valid implementation choice for the ChooseRandomNonExcludedTag()
pseudocode function used by IRG is to behave in the same way as with
GCR_EL1.RRND=0. This would mean that RGSR_EL1.SEED is used as an LFSR
which must have a non-zero value in order for IRG to properly produce
pseudorandom numbers. However, RGSR_EL1 is reset to an UNKNOWN value
on soft reset and thus may reset to 0. Therefore we must initialize
RGSR_EL1.SEED to a non-zero value in order to ensure that IRG behaves
as expected.
