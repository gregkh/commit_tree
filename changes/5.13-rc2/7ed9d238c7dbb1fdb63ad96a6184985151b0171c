userfaultfd: release page in error path to avoid BUG_ON

Consider the following sequence of events:

1. Userspace issues a UFFD ioctl, which ends up calling into
   shmem_mfill_atomic_pte(). We successfully account the blocks, we
   shmem_alloc_page(), but then the copy_from_user() fails. We return
   -ENOENT. We don't release the page we allocated.
2. Our caller detects this error code, tries the copy_from_user() after
   dropping the mmap_lock, and retries, calling back into
   shmem_mfill_atomic_pte().
3. Meanwhile, let's say another process filled up the tmpfs being used.
4. So shmem_mfill_atomic_pte() fails to account blocks this time, and
   immediately returns - without releasing the page.

This triggers a BUG_ON in our caller, which asserts that the page
should always be consumed, unless -ENOENT is returned.

To fix this, detect if we have such a "dangling" page when accounting
fails, and if so, release it before returning.
