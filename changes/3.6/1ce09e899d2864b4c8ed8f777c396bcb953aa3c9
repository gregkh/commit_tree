hyperv: Add support for setting MAC from within guests

This adds support for setting synthetic NIC MAC address from within Linux
guests. Before using this feature, the option "spoofing of MAC address"
should be enabled at the Hyper-V manager / Settings of the synthetic
NIC.

Thanks to Kin Cho <kcho@infoblox.com> for the initial implementation and
tests. And, thanks to Long Li <longli@microsoft.com> for the debugging
works.
