ARM: dma-mapping: add support for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC attribute

This patch adds support for DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC attribute for
dma_(un)map_(single,page,sg) functions family. It lets dma mapping clients
to create a mapping for the buffer for the given device without performing
a CPU cache synchronization. CPU cache synchronization can be skipped for
the buffers which it is known that they are already in 'device' domain (CPU
caches have been already synchronized or there are only coherent mappings
for the buffer). For advanced users only, please use it with care.
