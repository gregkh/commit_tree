w1: introduce a slave mutex for serializing IO

w1 devices need a mutex to serial IO.  Most use master->mutex.
However that is used for other purposes and they can conflict.

In particular master->mutex is held while w1_attach_slave_device is
called.

For bq27000, this registers a 'powersupply' device which tries to read the
current status.  The attempt to read will cause a deadlock on
master->mutex.

So create a new per-slave mutex and use that for serializing IO for
bq27000.
