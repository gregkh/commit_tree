[SCSI] cleanup setting task state in scsi_error_handler()

A quick reading of scsi_error_handler() one could come away with the
impression that it does its wakeup event check while the task state is
TASK_RUNNING.  In fact it sets TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE at the bottom of the
loop, but that is ~50 lines down.

Just set TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE at the top of loop and be done.
