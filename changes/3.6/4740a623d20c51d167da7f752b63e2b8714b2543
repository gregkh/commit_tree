libceph: change ceph_con_in_msg_alloc convention to be less weird

This function's calling convention is very limiting.  In particular,
we can't return any error other than ENOMEM (and only implicitly),
which is a problem (see next patch).

Instead, return an normal 0 or error code, and make the skip a pointer
output parameter.  Drop the useless in_hdr argument (we have the con
pointer).
