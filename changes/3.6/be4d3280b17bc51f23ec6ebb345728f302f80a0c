md/raid1: make sequential read detection per disk based

Currently the sequential read detection is global wide. It's natural to make it
per disk based, which can improve the detection for concurrent multiple
sequential reads. And next patch will make SSD read balance not use distance
based algorithm, where this change help detect truly sequential read for SSD.
