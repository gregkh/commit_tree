USB: Fix race condition when removing host controllers

This patch (as1607) fixes a race that can occur if a USB host
controller is removed while a process is reading the
/sys/kernel/debug/usb/devices file.

The usb_device_read() routine uses the bus->root_hub pointer to
determine whether or not the root hub is registered.  The is not a
valid test, because the pointer is set before the root hub gets
registered and remains set even after the root hub is unregistered and
deallocated.  As a result, usb_device_read() or usb_device_dump() can
access freed memory, causing an oops.

The patch changes the test to use the hcd->rh_registered flag, which
does get set and cleared at the appropriate times.  It also makes sure
to hold the usb_bus_list_lock mutex while setting the flag, so that
usb_device_read() will become aware of new root hubs as soon as they
are registered.
