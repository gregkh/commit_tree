mm, oom: fix potential killing of thread that is disabled from oom killing

/proc/sys/vm/oom_kill_allocating_task will immediately kill current when
the oom killer is called to avoid a potentially expensive tasklist scan
for large systems.

Currently, however, it is not checking current's oom_score_adj value which
may be OOM_SCORE_ADJ_MIN, meaning that it has been disabled from oom
killing.

This patch avoids killing current in such a condition and simply falls
back to the tasklist scan since memory still needs to be freed.
