mmc: core: Simplify and fix for SD switch processing

In mmc_read_switch, just do a one time mode 0 switch command to get the
support bits information, no need to do multiple times as the support
bits do not change with different arguments.

And no need to check current limit support bits, as these bits are
fixed according to the signal voltage. If the signal voltage is 1.8V,
the support bits would be 0xf and if the signal voltage is 3.3V, the
support bits would be 0x01. We will check host's ability to set the
current limit.
