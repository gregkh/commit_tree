ipv6_tunnel: Allow receiving packets on the fallback tunnel if they pass sanity checks

At Facebook, we do Layer-3 DSR via IP-in-IP tunneling. Our load balancers wrap
an extra IP header on incoming packets so they can be routed to the backend.
In the v4 tunnel driver, when these packets fall on the default tunl0 device,
the behavior is to decapsulate them and drop them back on the stack. So our
setup is that tunl0 has the VIP and eth0 has (obviously) the backend's real
address.

In IPv6 we do the same thing, but the v6 tunnel driver didn't have this same
behavior - if you didn't have an explicit tunnel setup, it would drop the
packet.

This patch brings that v4 feature to the v6 driver.

The same IPv6 address checks are performed as with any normal tunnel,
but as the fallback tunnel endpoint addresses are unspecified, the checks
must be performed on a per-packet basis, rather than at tunnel
configuration time.
