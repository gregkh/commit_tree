digsig: add hash size comparision on signature verification

When pkcs_1_v1_5_decode_emsa() returns without error and hash sizes do
not match, hash comparision is not done and digsig_verify_rsa() returns
no error.  This is a bug and this patch fixes it.

The bug was introduced in v3.3 by commit b35e286a640f ("lib/digsig:
pkcs_1_v1_5_decode_emsa cleanup").
