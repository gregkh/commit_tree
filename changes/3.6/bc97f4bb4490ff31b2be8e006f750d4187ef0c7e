[SCSI] scsi_dh_alua: backoff alua rtpg retry linearly vs. geometrically

Currently the backoff algorithm for when to retry alua rtpg
requests progresses geometrically as so:

2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64... seconds.

This progression can lead to un-needed delay in retrying
alua rtpg requests when the rtpgs are delayed.  A less
aggressive backoff algorithm that is additive would not
lead to such large jumps when delays start getting long, but
would backoff linearly:

2, 4, 6, 8, 10... seconds.
