x86: Define early read-mostly per-cpu macros

Some read-mostly per-cpu data may need to be declared or defined
early, so it can be initialized and accessed before per_cpu
areas are allocated.

Only the data that resides in the per_cpu areas should be
read-mostly, as there is little benefit in optimizing cache
lines on initialization.
