mm: change nr_ptes BUG_ON to WARN_ON

Occasionally an isolated BUG_ON(mm->nr_ptes) gets reported, indicating
that not all the page tables allocated could be found and freed when
exit_mmap() tore down the user address space.

There's usually nothing we can say about it, beyond that it's probably a
sign of some bad memory or memory corruption; though it might still
indicate a bug in vma or page table management (and did recently reveal a
race in THP, fixed a few months ago).

But one overdue change we can make is from BUG_ON to WARN_ON.

It's fairly likely that the system will crash shortly afterwards in some
other way (for example, the BUG_ON(page_mapped(page)) in
__delete_from_page_cache(), once an inode mapped into the lost page tables
gets evicted); but might tell us more before that.

Change the BUG_ON(page_mapped) to WARN_ON too?  Later perhaps: I'm less
eager, since that one has several times led to fixes.
