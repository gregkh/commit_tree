kconfig: check ncursesw headers first in check-lxdialog

Commit 8c41e5e363db55d91aa3b1cdce4ab02ad9821de7 added a check for
ncursesw/curses.h for the case where ncurses and ncursesw are build
separately but only one is installed.  But if both are installed,
the headers ncurses/curses.h and ncursesw/curses.h differ, and since
libncursesw will be found first, so should ncursesw/curses.h.
