ARM: omap: allow building omap44xx without SMP

The new omap4 cpuidle implementation currently requires
ARCH_NEEDS_CPU_IDLE_COUPLED, which only works on SMP.

This patch makes it possible to build a non-SMP kernel
for that platform. This is not normally desired for
end-users but can be useful for testing.

Without this patch, building rand-0y2jSKT results in:

drivers/cpuidle/coupled.c: In function 'cpuidle_coupled_poke':
drivers/cpuidle/coupled.c:317:3: error: implicit declaration of function '__smp_call_function_single' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

It's not clear if this patch is the best solution for
the problem at hand. I have made sure that we can now
build the kernel in all configurations, but that does
not mean it will actually work on an OMAP44xx.
