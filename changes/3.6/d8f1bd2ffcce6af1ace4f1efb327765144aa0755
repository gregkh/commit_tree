bcma: fix regression in interrupt assignment on mips

The wrong interrupts where assigned to the cores in
bcma_core_mips_init(). This caused at least my serial console not to
response to any input.

This was caused by this patch which changed the order of the cores in
the list:

    bcma: add new cores at the end of list

This should be fixed properly later so that the correct interrupt
numbers are assigned to the cores independently from the ordering of
the list. This patch restores the old behavior again. I will look into
the problem more deeply later.

I also changed the order of the list with the cores and their assigned
interrupt number which gets printed to the log. Now they are printed in
the same order like all the other lists of cores and like it was done
before the patch which changed the order.
