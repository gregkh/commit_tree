workqueue: factor out worker_pool from global_cwq

Move worklist and all worker management fields from global_cwq into
the new struct worker_pool.  worker_pool points back to the containing
gcwq.  worker and cpu_workqueue_struct are updated to point to
worker_pool instead of gcwq too.

This change is mechanical and doesn't introduce any functional
difference other than rearranging of fields and an added level of
indirection in some places.  This is to prepare for multiple pools per
gcwq.

v2: Comment typo fixes as suggested by Namhyung.
