ixgbe: clean up ixgbe_get_settings ethtool function

This patch cleans up the method used for determining the link speed of
devices. The old method re-wrote some logic already existing in a mac.ops
function which should be used instead. The result is much simpler to
understand and removes a strange double-check of logic, as well as reducing
code redundancy.
