USB: vt6656: remove __devinit* from the struct usb_device_id table

This structure needs to always stick around, even if CONFIG_HOTPLUG
is disabled, otherwise we can oops when trying to probe a device that
was added after the structure is thrown away.

Thanks to Fengguang Wu and Bjørn Mork for tracking this issue down.
