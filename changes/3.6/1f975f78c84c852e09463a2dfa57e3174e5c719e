x86, pvops: Remove hooks for {rd,wr}msr_safe_regs

There were paravirt_ops hooks for the full register set variant of
{rd,wr}msr_safe which are actually not used by anyone anymore. Remove
them to make the code cleaner and avoid silent breakages when the pvops
members were uninitialized. This has been boot-tested natively and under
Xen with PVOPS enabled and disabled on one machine.
