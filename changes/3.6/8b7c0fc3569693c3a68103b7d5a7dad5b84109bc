wlcore: Propagate errors from wlcore_raw_*_data functions

wlcore_raw_read_data is called when the FW status is read which happens
while handling interrupts and when the FW log is read following a
recovery. Request a recovery in the former case, and don't read the FW
log in case the FW status read failed.
