cpusets: Remove/update outdated comments

cpuset_track_online_cpus() is no longer present. So remove the
outdated comment and replace it with reference to cpuset_update_active_cpus()
which is its equivalent.

Also, we don't lack memory hot-unplug anymore. And David Rientjes pointed
out how it is dealt with. So update that comment as well.
