net: fix rtnetlink IFF_PROMISC and IFF_ALLMULTI handling

When device flags are set using rtnetlink, IFF_PROMISC and IFF_ALLMULTI
flags are handled specially. Function dev_change_flags sets IFF_PROMISC and
IFF_ALLMULTI bits in dev->gflags according to the passed value but
do_setlink passes a result of rtnl_dev_combine_flags which takes those bits
from dev->flags.

This can be easily trigerred by doing:

tcpdump -i eth0 &
ip l s up eth0

ip sets IFF_UP flag in ifi_flags and ifi_change, which is combined with
IFF_PROMISC by rtnl_dev_combine_flags, causing __dev_change_flags to set
IFF_PROMISC in gflags.
