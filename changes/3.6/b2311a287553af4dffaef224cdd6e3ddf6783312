[SCSI] libsas: sas_rediscover_dev did not look at the SMP exec status.

The discovery function "sas_rediscover_dev" had two bugs: 1) it did
not pay attention to the return status from the SMP task execution;
2) the stack variable used for the returned SAS address was compared
against 0 without being initialized.
