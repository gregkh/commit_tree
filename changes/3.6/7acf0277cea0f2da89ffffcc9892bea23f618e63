dm: introduce split_discard_requests

This patch introduces a new variable split_discard_requests. It can be
set by targets so that discard requests are split on max_io_len
boundaries.

When split_discard_requests is not set, discard requests are only split on
boundaries between targets, as was the case before this patch.
