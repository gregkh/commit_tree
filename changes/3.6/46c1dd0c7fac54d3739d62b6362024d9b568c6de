cfg80211: fix regression in multi-vif AP start

Commit "cfg80211: provide channel to start_ap function" assumes that the
channel is always passed to the NL80211_CMD_START_AP command, however
in case of multi-BSSID, hostapd only passes the channel for the first vif.
This makes starting beaconing on secondary vifs fail with -EINVAL.

Fix this by storing the channel provided to .start_ap in wdev->preset_chan
and picking the first AP vif's channel for secondary vifs if not provided.
