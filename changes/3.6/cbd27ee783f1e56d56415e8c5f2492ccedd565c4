KVM: x86 emulator: initialize memop

memop is not initialized; this can lead to a two-byte operation
following a 4-byte operation to see garbage values.  Usually
truncation fixes things fot us later on, but at least in one case
(call abs) it doesn't.

Fix by moving memop to the auto-initialized field area.
