bnx2x: Make the transmission queues adjacent

In the current scheme the transmission queues of traffic-class 0 were 0-15, the
transmission queues of traffic-class 1 were 16-31 and so on. If the number of
RSS queues was smaller than 16, there were gaps in transmission queues
numbering, as well as in CIDs numbering. This is both a waste (especially when
16 is increased to 64), and may causes problems with flushing queues when
reducing the number of RSS queues (using ethtool -L). The new scheme eliminates
the gaps.
