libceph: fully initialize connection in con_init()

Move the initialization of a ceph connection's private pointer,
operations vector pointer, and peer name information into
ceph_con_init().  Rearrange the arguments so the connection pointer
is first.  Hide the byte-swapping of the peer entity number inside
ceph_con_init()
