irqdomain: Simple NUMA awareness.

While common irqdesc allocation is node aware, the irqdomain code is not.

Presently we observe a number of regressions/inconsistencies on
NUMA-capable platforms:

- Platforms using irqdomains with legacy mappings, where the
  irq_descs are allocated node-local and the irqdomain data
  structure is not.

- Drivers implementing irqdomains will lose node locality
  regardless of the underlying struct device's node id.

This plugs in NUMA node id proliferation across the various allocation
callsites by way of_node_to_nid() node lookup. While of_node_to_nid()
does the right thing for OF-capable platforms it doesn't presently handle
the non-DT case. This is trivially dealt with by simply wraping in to
numa_node_id() unconditionally.
