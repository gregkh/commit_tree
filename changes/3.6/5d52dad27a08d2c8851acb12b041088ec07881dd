batman-adv: Initialize lockdep class keys for hashes

The hash for claim and backbone hash in the bridge loop avoidance code receive
the same key because they are getting initialized by hash_new with the same
key. Lockdep will create a backtrace when they are used recursively. This can
be avoided by reinitializing the key directly after the hash_new.
