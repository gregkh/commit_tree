ipv6: optimize ipv6 addresses compares

On 64 bit arches having efficient unaligned accesses (eg x86_64) we can
use long words to reduce number of instructions for free.

Joe Perches suggested to change ipv6_masked_addr_cmp() to return a bool
instead of 'int', to make sure ipv6_masked_addr_cmp() cannot be used
in a sorting function.
