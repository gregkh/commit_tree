staging: vt6656: iwctl: Fix up variable declarations (whitespace and 'one-per-line')

Ensure that we have only one variable declaration per line and for
each of those lines we have one space between type and variable name
and if there's assignment, then we have one space on each side of the
equals sign (and no more than 80 characters per line).
