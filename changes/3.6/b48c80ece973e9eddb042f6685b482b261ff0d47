inet: Add family scope inetpeer flushes.

This implementation can deal with having many inetpeer roots, which is
a necessary prerequisite for per-FIB table rooted peer tables.

Each family (AF_INET, AF_INET6) has a sequence number which we bump
when we get a family invalidation request.

Each peer lookup cheaply checks whether the flush sequence of the
root we are using is out of date, and if so flushes it and updates
the sequence number.
