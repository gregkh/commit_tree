ARM: 7496/1: hw_breakpoint: don't rely on dfsr to show watchpoint access type

From ARM debug architecture v7.1 onwards, a watchpoint exception causes
the DFAR to be updated with the faulting data address. However, DFSR.WnR
takes an UNKNOWN value and therefore cannot be used in general to
determine the access type that triggered the watchpoint.

This patch forbids watchpoints without an overflow handler from
specifying a specific access type (load/store). Those with overflow
handlers must be able to handle false positives potentially triggered by
a watchpoint of a different access type on the same address. For
SIGTRAP-based handlers (i.e. ptrace), this should have no impact.
