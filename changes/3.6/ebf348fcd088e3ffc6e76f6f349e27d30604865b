cfg80211: validate remain-on-channel time better

The remain-on-channel time validation shouldn't
depend on the value of HZ, as it does now with
the check against jiffies, since then you might
use a value that works on one system but not on
another. Fix it by checking against a minimum
that's fixed.

Also add validation of the wait duration for a
management frame TX since this also translates
into remain-on-channel internally.
