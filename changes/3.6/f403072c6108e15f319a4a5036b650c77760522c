uprobes: Don't recheck vma/f_mapping in write_opcode()

write_opcode() rechecks valid_vma() and ->f_mapping, this is
pointless. The caller, register_for_each_vma() or uprobe_mmap(),
has already done these checks under mmap_sem.

To clarify, uprobe_mmap() checks valid_vma() only, but we can
rely on build_probe_list(vm_file->f_mapping->host).
