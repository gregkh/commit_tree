drm/i915: properly SIGBUS on I/O errors

... instead of looping endless with no hope of ever serving that
page-fault. We only need to break out of this loop when the gpu died,
to run the reset work (and hopefully resurrect it).

To clarify questions Chris raised on irc: This is about handling I/O
errors not from our own code, but e.g. when the disk died when trying
to swap in a gem bo. So this patch remidies the issue that the current
handling only handles gpu-death-induced cases of -EIO. Admittedly,
dying disks are much rarer than hanging gpus ...To clarify questions
