crypto: algapi - Fix hang on crypto allocation

git commit 398710379 (crypto: algapi - Move larval completion
into algboss) replaced accidentally a call to complete_all() by
a call to complete(). This causes a hang on crypto allocation
if we have more than one larval waiter. This pach restores the
call to complete_all().
