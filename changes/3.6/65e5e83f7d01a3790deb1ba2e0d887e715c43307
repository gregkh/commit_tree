fs/ufs: remove extra superblock write on unmount

UFS calls 'ufs_write_super()' from 'ufs_put_super()' in order to write the
superblocks to the media. However, it is not needed because VFS calls
'->sync_fs()' before calling '->put_super()' - so by the time we are in
'ufs_write_super()', the superblocks are already synchronized.
