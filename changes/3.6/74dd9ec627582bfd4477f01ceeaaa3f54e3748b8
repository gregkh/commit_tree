ARM: OMAP: dmtimer: use devm_ API and do some cleanup in probe()

Replace the regular kzalloc and ioremap with the devm_ equivalent
to simplify error handling. We don't need kree() any more in
omap_dm_timer_remove().

Also added *dev* pointer to reference pdev->dev which makes the
usage shorter in code.
