netfilter: NFQUEUE: don't xor src/dst ip address for load distribution

because reply packets need to go to the same nfqueue, src/dst ip
address were xor'd prior to jhash().

However, this causes bad distribution for some workloads, e.g.
flows a.b.1.{1,n} -> a.b.2.{1,n} all share the same hash value.

Avoid this by hashing both. To get same hash for replies,
first argument is the smaller address.
