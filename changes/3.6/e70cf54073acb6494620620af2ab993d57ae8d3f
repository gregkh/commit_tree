tile: gxio iorpc numbering change for TRIO interface

An ABI numbering change was made in the hypervisor for Tilera's 4.1
MDE release (just shipped).  It's incompatible with the previous 4.0
release ABI numbering, so we track the new numbering going forward.
We plan to avoid modifying ABI numbering for these interfaces again.
