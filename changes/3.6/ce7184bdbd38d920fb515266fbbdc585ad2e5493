xen: fix logical error in tlb flushing

While TLB_FLUSH_ALL gets passed as 'end' argument to
flush_tlb_others(), the Xen code was made to check its 'start'
parameter. That may give a incorrect op.cmd to MMUEXT_INVLPG_MULTI
instead of MMUEXT_TLB_FLUSH_MULTI. Then it causes some page can not
be flushed from TLB.

This patch fixed this issue.
