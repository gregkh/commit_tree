tcp: refine SYN handling in tcp_validate_incoming

Followup of commit 0c24604b68fc (tcp: implement RFC 5961 4.2)

As reported by Vijay Subramanian, we should send a challenge ACK
instead of a dup ack if a SYN flag is set on a packet received out of
window.

This permits the ratelimiting to work as intended, and to increase
correct SNMP counters.
