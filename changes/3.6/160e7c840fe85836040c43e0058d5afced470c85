remoteproc: adopt the driver core's alloc/add/del/put naming

To make remoteproc's API more intuitive for developers, we adopt
the driver core's naming, i.e. alloc -> add -> del -> put. We'll also
add register/unregister when their first user shows up.

Otherwise - there's no functional change here.
