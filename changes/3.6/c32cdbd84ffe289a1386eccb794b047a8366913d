ath9k: Stop the BTCOEX timers before disabling BTCOEX

Its safe to stop the BTCOEX timers 'period_timer' and
'no_stomp_timer' before disabling BTCOEX. These timers
can call ath9k_hw_btcoex_enable (or) change the BT
stomp type if they seem to be running after we had
called ath9k_hw_btcoex_disable, which is obviously
not correct.
