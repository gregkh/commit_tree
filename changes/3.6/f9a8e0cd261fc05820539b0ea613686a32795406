dm thin: optimize power of two block size

dm-thin will be most likely used with a block size that is a power of
two. So it should be optimized for this case.

This patch changes division and modulo operations to shifts and bit
masks if block size is a power of two.

A test that bi_sector is divisible by a block size is removed from
io_overlaps_block. Device mapper never sends bios that span a block
boundary. Consequently, if we tested that bi_size is equivalent to block
size, bi_sector must already be on a block boundary.
