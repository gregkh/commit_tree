ath9k: Fix race in reset-work usage

Using work_pending() to defer certain operations when
a HW-reset work has been queued is racy since the check
would return false when the work item is actually in
execution. Use SC_OP_HW_RESET instead to fix this race.
Also, unify the reset debug statistics maintenance.
