powerpc/perf: Move code to select SIAR or pt_regs into perf_read_regs

The logic to choose whether to use the SIAR or get the information
out of pt_regs is going to get more complicated, so do it once in
perf_read_regs.

We overload regs->result which is gross but we are already doing it
with regs->dsisr.
