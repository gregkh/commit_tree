[SCSI] bnx2fc: Improve error recovery by handling parity errors

During parity errors, the ramrods are not issued to FW. bnx2fc waits for the
timeout value, and proceeds with cleaning up the IOs. Since we are already
out-of-sync with FW, cleanup commands timeout too, and do not get the
completion.  This operation takes 36 secs for each session to upload causing
huge delays. To fix this, bnx2fc now gets a PARITY_ERROR from cnic driver, and
upon failure, the driver does not issue any commands to the FW and finishes the
upload process sooner.
