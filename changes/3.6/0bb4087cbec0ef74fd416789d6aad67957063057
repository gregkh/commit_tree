ipv4: Fix neigh lookup keying over loopback/point-to-point devices.

We were using a special key "0" for all loopback and point-to-point
device neigh lookups under ipv4, but we wouldn't use that special
key for the neigh creation.

So basically we'd make a new neigh at each and every lookup :-)

This special case to use only one neigh for these device types
is of dubious value, so just remove it entirely.
