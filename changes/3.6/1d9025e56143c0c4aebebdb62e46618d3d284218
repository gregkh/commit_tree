xfs: remove struct xfs_dabuf and infrastructure

The struct xfs_dabuf now only tracks a single xfs_buf and all the
information it holds can be gained directly from the xfs_buf. Hence
we can remove the struct dabuf and pass the xfs_buf around
everywhere.

Kill the struct dabuf and the associated infrastructure.
