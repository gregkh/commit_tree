ASoC: tegra+wm8903: unconditionally free jack GPIOs in remove

The headphone jack GPIOs are added/initialized in the DAI link's init()
method, and hence in theory may not always have been added before remove()
is called in some unusual cases. In order to prevent calling
snd_soc_jack_free_gpios() if snd_soc_jack_add_gpios() had not been, the
code kept track of the initialization state to avoid the free call when
necessary.

However, it appears that snd_soc_jack_free_gpios() is robust in the face
of being called without snd_soc_jack_add_gpios() first succeeding, so
there is little point manually tracking this information. Hence, remove
the tracking code. Almost all other machine drivers already operate this
way.
