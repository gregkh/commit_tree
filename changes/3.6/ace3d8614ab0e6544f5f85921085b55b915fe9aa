HID: uhid: add internal message buffer

When receiving messages from the HID subsystem, we need to process them
and store them in an internal buffer so user-space can read() on the char
device to retrieve the messages.

This adds a static buffer for 32 messages to each uhid device. Each
message is dynamically allocated so the uhid_device structure does not get
too big.

uhid_queue() adds a message to the buffer. If the buffer is full, the
message is discarded. uhid_queue_event() is an helper for messages without
payload.

This also adds a public header: uhid.h. It contains the declarations for
the user-space API. It is built around "struct uhid_event" which contains
a type field which specifies the event type and each event can then add a
variable-length payload. For now, there is only a dummy event but later
patches will add new event types and payloads.
