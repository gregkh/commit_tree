KVM: Split cpuid register access from computation

Introduce kvm_cpuid() to perform the leaf limit check and calculate
register values, and let kvm_emulate_cpuid() just handle reading and
writing the registers from/to the vcpu.  This allows us to reuse
kvm_cpuid() in a context where directly reading and writing registers
is not desired.
