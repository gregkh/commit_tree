[SCSI] virtio-scsi: Add vdrv->scan for post VIRTIO_CONFIG_S_DRIVER_OK LUN scanning

This patch changes virtio-scsi to use a new virtio_driver->scan() callback
so that scsi_scan_host() can be properly invoked once virtio_dev_probe() has
set add_status(dev, VIRTIO_CONFIG_S_DRIVER_OK) to signal active virtio-ring
operation, instead of from within virtscsi_probe().

This fixes a bug where SCSI LUN scanning for both virtio-scsi-raw and
virtio-scsi/tcm_vhost setups was happening before VIRTIO_CONFIG_S_DRIVER_OK
had been set, causing VIRTIO_SCSI_S_BAD_TARGET to occur.  This fixes a bug
with virtio-scsi/tcm_vhost where LUN scan was not detecting LUNs.

Tested with virtio-scsi-raw + virtio-scsi/tcm_vhost w/ IBLOCK on 3.5-rc2 code.
