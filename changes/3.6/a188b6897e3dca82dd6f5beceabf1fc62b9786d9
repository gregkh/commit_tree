usb: gadget: hsotg: pullup method implementation for s3c-hsotg UDC driver

This commit adds pullup method implementation for UDC s3c-hsotg driver.
It is needed for e.g. CCG - Configurable Composite Gadget, when user space
configuration change request device disconnection from USB bus (done via
calling usb_gadget_connect/disconnect, which calls UDC's pullup method).

Implementation of pullup method has caused removal of phy_enable and
core_init methods from udc_start to pullup.
