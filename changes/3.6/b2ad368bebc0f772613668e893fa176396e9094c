tracing: Fix initialization failure path in tracing_set_tracer()

If tracer->init() fails, current code will leave current_tracer pointing
to an unusable tracer, which at best makes 'current_tracer' report
inaccurate value.

Fix the issue by pointing current_tracer to nop tracer, and only update
current_tracer with the new one after all the initialization succeeds.
