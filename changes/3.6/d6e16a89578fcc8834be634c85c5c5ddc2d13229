usb: gadget: mass_storage: fail fsg_store_file() early if colud not open file

Currently, when a new value is stored to the “file” sysfs entry,
fsg_store_file() will release existing backing file and only then attempt to
open a new one.  If that fails, no new backing file is open.

This commit changes the fsg_lun_open() so that it closes existing backing file
only after the new backing file has been successfully opened.  With that
change, fsg_store_file() may use it to perform an atomic open operation with
guarantee that logical unit will either point to the new backing file or still
to the old one.
