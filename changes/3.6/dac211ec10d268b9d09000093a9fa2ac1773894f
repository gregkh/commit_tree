mac80211: fail authentication when AP denied authentication

ieee80211_rx_mgmt_auth() doesn't handle denied authentication
properly - it authenticates the station and waits for association
(for 5 seconds) instead of failing the authentication.

Fix it by destroying auth_data and bailing out instead.
