target: add a parse_cdb method to the backend drivers

Instead of trying to handle all SCSI command sets in one function
(transport_generic_cmd_sequencer) call out to the backend driver to perform
this functionality.  For pSCSI a copy of the existing code is used, but for
all virtual backends we can use a new parse_sbc_cdb helper is used to
provide a simple SBC emulation.

For now this setups means a fair amount of duplication between pSCSI and the
SBC library, but patches later in this series will sort out that problem.
