powerpc: Add VDSO version of getcpu

We have a request for a fast method of getting CPU and NUMA node IDs
from userspace. This patch implements a getcpu VDSO function,
similar to x86.

Ben suggested we use SPRG3 which is userspace readable. SPRG3 can be
modified by a KVM guest, so we save the SPRG3 value in the paca and
restore it when transitioning from the guest to the host.

I have a glibc patch that implements sched_getcpu on top of this.
Testing on a POWER7:

baseline: 538 cycles
vdso:      30 cycles
