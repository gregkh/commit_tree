time: Rework timekeeping functions to take timekeeper ptr as argument

As part of cleaning up the timekeeping code, this patch converts
a number of internal functions to takei a timekeeper ptr as an
argument, so that the internal functions don't access the global
timekeeper structure directly. This allows for further optimizations
to reduce lock hold time later.

This patch has been updated to include more consistent usage of the
timekeeper value, by making sure it is always passed as a argument
to non top-level functions.
