dmaengine: virt-dma: add support for cyclic DMA periodic callbacks

Add support for cyclic DMA's periodic callbacks.  Drivers are expected
to call vchan_cyclic_callback() when a period has completed, which will
schedule the tasklet to make the callback into the driver.

As callbacks are made from tasklet context, it is important to realise
that we don't guarantee a callback for each completed period, but for
N completed periods where N may be greater than one.
