Bluetooth: Update HCI timeouts constants to use msecs_to_jiffies

The HCI constants are always used in form of jiffies. So just
include the conversion from msecs in the define itself. This has the
advantage of making the code where the timeout is used more readable
and avoiding unnecessary conversions.

The patch is similar to commit ba13ccd9 doing the same job for L2CAP
