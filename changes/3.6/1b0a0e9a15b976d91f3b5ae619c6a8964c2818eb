cpuidle: add checks to avoid NULL pointer dereference

The existing check for dev == NULL in __cpuidle_register_device() is
rendered useless because dev is dereferenced before the check itself.
Moreover, correctly speaking, it is the job of the callers of this
function, i.e., cpuidle_register_device() & cpuidle_enable_device() (which
also happen to be exported functions) to ensure that
__cpuidle_register_device() is called with a non-NULL dev.

So add the necessary dev == NULL checks in the two callers and remove the
(useless) check from __cpuidle_register_device().
