drbd: announce FLUSH/FUA capability to upper layers

Unconditionally announce FLUSH/FUA to upper layers.
If the lower layers on either node do not actually support this,
generic_make_request() will deal with it.

If this causes performance regressions on your setup,
make sure there are no volatile caches involved,
and mount -o nobarrier or equivalent.
