drm/i915: Inifite timeout for wait ioctl

Change the ns_timeout parameter of the wait ioctl to a signed value.
Doing this allows the kernel to provide an infinite wait when a timeout
of less than 0 is provided. This mimics select/poll.

Initially the parameter was meant to match up with the GL spec 1:1, but
after being made aware of how much 2^64 - 1 nanoseconds actually is, I
do not think anyone will ever notice the loss of 1 bit.

The infinite timeout on waiting is similar to the existing i915
userspace interface with the exception that struct_mutex is dropped
while doing the wait in this ioctl.
