ARM: 7439/1: head.S: simplify initial page table mapping

Let's map the initial RAM up to the end of the kernel .bss instead of
the strict kernel image area.  This simplifies the code as the kernel
image only needs to be handled specially in the XIP case.  That covers
the legacy ATAG location as well.
