Revert "md/raid5: For odirect-write performance, do not set STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE."

This reverts commit 895e3c5c58a80bb9e4e05d9ac38b4f30e0f97d80.

While this patch seemed like a good idea and did help some workloads,
it hurts other workloads.
Large sequential O_DIRECT writes were faster,
Small random O_DIRECT writes were slower.

Other changes (batching RAID5 writes) have improved the sequential
writes using a different mechanism, so the net result of this patch
is definitely negative.  So revert it.
