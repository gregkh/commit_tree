[SCSI] async: introduce 'async_domain' type

This is in preparation for teaching async_synchronize_full() to sync all
pending async work, and not just on the async_running domain.  This
conversion is functionally equivalent, just embedding the existing list
in a new async_domain type.

The .registered attribute is used in a later patch to distinguish
between domains that want to be flushed by async_synchronize_full()
versus those that only expect async_synchronize_{full|cookie}_domain to
be used for flushing.
