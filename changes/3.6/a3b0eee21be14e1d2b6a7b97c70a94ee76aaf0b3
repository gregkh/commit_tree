staging: comedi: Kconfig: fix drivers that require the 8255 driver

Many of the comedi drivers require the 8255 driver for
various subdevice support. The Makefile currently uses
CONFIG_COMEDI_PCI_DRIVERS to make sure the 8255 driver
is compiled. The Kconfig help for that option says that
it does not directly affect the kernel.

Fix this by adding 'select COMEDI_8255' to the drivers
that actually need the support.

Also, remove two cases where the drivers don't require
the 8255 support.
