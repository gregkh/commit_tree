char/ipmi: remove local ioctl defines replaced by generic ones

This watchdog driver had ioctl defines introduced locally
for pre timeout handling, marked to be removed as soon as
a generic replacement would become available.

The latter has actually occurred in 2006, at e05b59fe.

Remove the local duplicates for pre timeout handling.
