powerpc/powernv: Always go into nap mode when CPU is offline

The CPU hotplug code for the powernv platform currently only puts
offline CPUs into nap mode if the powersave_nap variable is set.
However, HV-style KVM on this platform requires secondary CPU threads
to be offline and in nap mode.  Since we know nap mode works just
fine on all POWER7 machines, and the only machines that support the
powernv platform are POWER7 machines, this changes the code to
always put offline CPUs into nap mode, regardless of powersave_nap.
Powersave_nap still controls whether or not CPUs go into nap mode
when idle, as before.
