USB: EHCI: remove PS3 status polling

This patch (as1575) removes special code added for status polling of
the EHCI controller in PS3 systems.  While the controller is running,
the polling is now carried out by an hrtimer handler.  When the
controller is suspending or stopping, we use the same polling routine
as the old code -- but in neither case do we need to conclude that the
controller has died if the polling goes on for too long.

As a result the entire handshake_on_error_set_halt() routine is now
unused, so it is removed from the driver.
