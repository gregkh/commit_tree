rbd: drop "object_name" from rbd_req_sync_watch()

rbd_req_sync_watch() is only called in one place, and in that place
it passes rbd_dev->header_name as the value of the "object_name"
parameter.  This value is available within the function already.

Having the extra parameter leaves the impression the object name
could take on different values, but it does not.

So get rid of the parameter.  We can always add it back again if
we find we want to watch some other object in the future.
