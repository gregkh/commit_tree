tcp: Get rid of inetpeer special cases.

The get_peer method TCP uses is full of special cases that make no
sense accommodating, and it also gets in the way of doing more
reasonable things here.

First of all, if the socket doesn't have a usable cached route, there
is no sense in trying to optimize timewait recycling.

Likewise for the case where we have IP options, such as SRR enabled,
that make the IP header destination address (and thus the destination
address of the route key) differ from that of the connection's
destination address.

Just return a NULL peer in these cases, and thus we're also able to
get rid of the clumsy inetpeer release logic.
