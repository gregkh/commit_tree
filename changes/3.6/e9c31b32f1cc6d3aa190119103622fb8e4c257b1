debug: Do not permit CONFIG_DEBUG_STACK_USAGE=y on IA64 or PARISC

The stack_not_used() function in <linux/sched.h> assumes that stacks
grow downwards. This is not true on IA64 or PARISC, so this function
would walk off in the wrong direction and into the weeds.

Found on IA64 because of a compilation failure with recursive dependencies
on IA64_TASKSIZE and IA64_THREAD_INFO_SIZE.

Fixing the code is possible, but should be combined with other
infrastructure additions to set up the "canary" at the end of the stack.
