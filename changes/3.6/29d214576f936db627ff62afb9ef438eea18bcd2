xhci: Recognize USB 3.0 devices as superspeed at powerup

On Intel Panther Point chipset USB 3.0 devices show up as
high-speed devices on powerup, but after an s3 cycle they are
correctly recognized as SuperSpeed. At powerup switch the port
to xHCI so that USB 3.0 devices are correctly recognized.

commit ID 69e848c2090aebba5698a1620604c7dccb448684 "Intel xhci: Support
