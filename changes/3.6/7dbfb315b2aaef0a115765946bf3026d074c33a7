drivers/rtc/rtc-rs5c348.c: fix hour decoding in 12-hour mode

Correct the offset by subtracting 20 from tm_hour before taking the
modulo 12.

[ "Why 20?" I hear you ask. Or at least I did.

  Here's the reason why: RS5C348_BIT_PM is 32, and is - stupidly -
  included in the RS5C348_HOURS_MASK define.  So it's really subtracting
  out that bit to get "hour+12".  But then because it does things modulo
  12, it needs to add the 12 in again afterwards anyway.

  This code is confused.  It would be much clearer if RS5C348_HOURS_MASK
  just didn't include the RS5C348_BIT_PM bit at all, then it wouldn't
  need to do the silly subtract either.

  Whatever. It's all just math, the end result is the same.   - Linus ]
