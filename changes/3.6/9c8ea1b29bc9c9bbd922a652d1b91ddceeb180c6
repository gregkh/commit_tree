iio: add LM3533 ambient-light-sensor driver

Add sub-driver for the ambient-light-sensor interface on National
Semiconductor / TI LM3533 lighting power chips.

The sensor interface can be used to control the LEDs and backlights of
the chip through defining five light zones and three sets of
corresponding output-current values.

The driver provides raw and mean adc readings along with the current
light zone through sysfs. A threshold event can be generated on zone
changes. The ALS-control output values can be set per zone for the three
current output channels.
