ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: temporarily comment out data for the sl2if IP block

The OMAP4 sl2if IP block requires some special programming for it to
enter idle. Without this programming, it will prevent the rest of
the chip from entering full chip idle.

This patch comments out the IP block data.

Later, once the appropriate support is available, this patch can be
reverted.
