exofs: stop using s_dirt

Exofs has the '->write_super()' handler and makes some use of the '->s_dirt'
superblock flag, but it really needs neither of them because it never sets
's_dirt' to one which means the VFS never calls its '->write_super()' handler.
Thus, remove both.

Note, I am trying to remove both 's_dirt' and 'write_super()' from VFS
altogether once all users are gone.
