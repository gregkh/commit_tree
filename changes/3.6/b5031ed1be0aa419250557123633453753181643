xen: Use correct masking in xen_swiotlb_alloc_coherent.

When running 32-bit pvops-dom0 and a driver tries to allocate a coherent
DMA-memory the xen swiotlb-implementation returned memory beyond 4GB.

The underlaying reason is that if the supplied driver passes in a
DMA_BIT_MASK(64) ( hwdev->coherent_dma_mask is set to 0xffffffffffffffff)
our dma_mask will be u64 set to 0xffffffffffffffff even if we set it to
DMA_BIT_MASK(32) previously. Meaning we do not reset the upper bits.
By using the dma_alloc_coherent_mask function - it does the proper casting
and we get 0xfffffffff.

This caused not working sound on a system with 4 GB and a 64-bit
compatible sound-card with sets the DMA-mask to 64bit.

On bare-metal and the forward-ported xen-dom0 patches from OpenSuse a coherent
DMA-memory is always allocated inside the 32-bit address-range by calling
dma_alloc_coherent_mask.

This patch adds the same functionality to xen swiotlb and is a rebase of the
original patch from Ronny Hegewald which never got upstream b/c the
underlaying reason was not understood until now.
