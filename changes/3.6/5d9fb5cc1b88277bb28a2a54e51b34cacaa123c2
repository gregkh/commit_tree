[SCSI] core, classes, mpt2sas: have scsi_internal_device_unblock take new state

This has scsi_internal_device_unblock/scsi_target_unblock take
the new state to set the devices as an argument instead of
always setting to running. The patch also converts users of these
functions.

This allows the FC and iSCSI class to transition devices from blocked
to transport-offline, so that when fast_io_fail/replacement_timeout
has fired we do not set the devices back to running. Instead, we
set them to SDEV_TRANSPORT_OFFLINE.
