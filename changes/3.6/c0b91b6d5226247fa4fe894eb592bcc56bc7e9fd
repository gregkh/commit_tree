asus-wmi: enable resume on lid open

According to the ASUS WMI spec., to enable resume on lid open should
use the device ID(0x00120032), but it doesn't work indeed.

After discussing with ASUS' BIOS engineer, they say wake on lid open
doesn't have a uniq device ID(0x00120032) in the BIOS. It shares the same
device ID with deep S3(0x00120031), and the deep S3(resume on lid open)
is disable by default.

Adding this option in asus wmi sysfs
   /sys/devices/platform/<platform>/lid_resume
so that userspace apps can enable/disable this feature by themselves.
