target: fix NULL pointer dereference bug alloc_page() fails to get memory

I am hitting this bug when the target is low in memory that fails the
alloc_page() for the newly submitted command. This is a sort of off-by-one
bug causing NULL pointer dereference in __free_page() since 'i' here is
really the counter of total pages that have been successfully allocated here.
