IB/qib: Fix failure of compliance test C14-024#06_LocalPortNum

Commit 3236b2d469db ("IB/qib: MADs with misset M_Keys should return
failure") introduced a return code assignment that unfortunately
introduced an unconditional exit for the routine due to missing braces.

This patch adds the braces to correct the original patch.
