ARM: 7451/1: arch timer: implement read_current_timer and get_cycles

This patch implements read_current_timer using the architected timers
when they are selected via CONFIG_ARM_ARCH_TIMER. If they are detected
not to be usable at runtime, we return -ENXIO to the caller.

Furthermore, if read_current_timer is exported then we can implement
get_cycles in terms of it for use as both an entropy source and for
implementing __udelay and friends.
