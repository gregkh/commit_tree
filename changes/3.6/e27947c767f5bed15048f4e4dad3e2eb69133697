libceph: define and use an explicit CONNECTED state

There is no state explicitly defined when a ceph connection is fully
operational.  So define one.

It's set when the connection sequence completes successfully, and is
cleared when the connection gets closed.

Be a little more careful when examining the old state when a socket
disconnect event is reported.
