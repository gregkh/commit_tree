mm: memcg: only check anon swapin page charges for swap cache

shmem knows for sure that the page is in swap cache when attempting to
charge a page, because the cache charge entry function has a check for it.
Only anon pages may be removed from swap cache already when trying to
charge their swapin.

Adjust the comment, though: '4969c11 mm: fix swapin race condition' added
a stable PageSwapCache check under the page lock in the do_swap_page()
before calling the memory controller, so it's unuse_pte()'s pte_same()
that may fail.
