perf/x86/amd: Unify AMD's generic and family 15h pmus

There is no need for keeping separate pmu structs. We can enable
amd_{get,put}_event_constraints() functions also for family 15h event.

The advantage is that there is only a single pmu struct for all AMD
cpus. This patch introduces functions to setup the pmu to enabe core
performance counters or counter constraints.

Also, cpuid checks are used instead of family checks where
possible. Thus, it enables the code independently of cpu families if
the feature flag is set.
