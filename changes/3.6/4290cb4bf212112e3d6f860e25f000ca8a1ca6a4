cfg80211: reduce monitor interface tracking

Revert commit b78e8ceac23655e1e06b30aa95ab11742d1ac7c0
("cfg80211: track monitor channel") and remove the
set_monitor_enabled() callback.

Due to the tracking happening in NETDEV_PRE_UP, it had
introduced bugs because the monitor interface callback
would be called before the device was started. It looks
like there's no way to fix this, and using NETDEV_PRE_UP
is broken anyway (since there's no NETDEV_UP_FAIL), so
remove all that code, track interfaces in NETDEV_UP and
also stop tracking the monitor channel in cfg80211.

This mostly reverts to before the tracking, except that
we keep the interface count tracking so that setting the
monitor channel can be rejected properly.
