libceph: (re)initialize bio_iter on start of message receive

Previously, we were opportunistically initializing the bio_iter if it
appeared to be uninitialized in the middle of the read path.  The problem
is that a sequence like:

 - start reading message
 - initialize bio_iter
 - read half a message
 - messenger fault, reconnect
 - restart reading message
 - ** bio_iter now non-NULL, not reinitialized **
 - read past end of bio, crash

Instead, initialize the bio_iter unconditionally when we allocate/claim
the message for read.
