Staging: ipack/bridges/tpci200: tpci200_slot_map_space() should return 0 if succeed.

tpci200_slot_map_space() should return 0 if the operation was properly
done. If not, the caller will think that something wrong happened.

This patch establish the returned value to 0. It is overwritten in case of
error.
