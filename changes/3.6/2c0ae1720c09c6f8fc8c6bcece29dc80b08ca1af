iommu/amd: Convert iommu initialization to state machine

This step makes it very easy to keep track about the current
intialization state of the iommu driver. With this change we
can initialize the IOMMU hardware to a point where it can
remap interrupts and later resume the initializion to enable
dma remapping.
