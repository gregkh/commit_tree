Bluetooth: Add the ERTM receive state machine

This adds a top-level state machine with handlers for two receive
states defined in the ERTM spec, RECV and SREJ_SENT.  The reqseq value
of the incoming frame is also validated at the top level and a
disconnection is forced if it is invalid.  The actions for the RECV
and SREJ_SENT states are implemented according to the state tables in
the ERTM specification.
