ALSA: hda - Fix invalid D3 of headphone DAC on VT202x codecs

We've got a bug report about the silent output from the headphone on a
mobo with VT2021, and spotted out that this was because of the wrong
D3 state on the DAC for the headphone output.  The bug is triggered by
the incomplete check for this DAC in set_widgets_power_state_vt1718S().
It checks only the connectivity of the primary output (0x27) but
doesn't consider the path from the headphone pin (0x28).

Now this patch fixes the problem by checking both pins for DAC 0x0b.
