ixgbe: Enable FCoE FSO and CRC offloads based on CAPABLE instead of ENABLED flag

Instead of only setting the FCOE segmentation offload and CRC offload flags
if we enable FCoE, we could just set them always since there are no
modifications needed to the hardware or adapter FCoE structure in order to
use these features.

The advantage to this is that if FCoE enablement fails, for example because
SR-IOV was enabled on 82599, we will still have use of the FCoE
segmentation offload and Tx/Rx CRC offloads which should still help to
improve the FCoE performance.
