x86, microcode: Sanitize per-cpu microcode reloading interface

Microcode reloading in a per-core manner is a very bad idea for both
major x86 vendors. And the thing is, we have such interface with which
we can end up with different microcode versions applied on different
cores of an otherwise homogeneous wrt (family,model,stepping) system.

So turn off the possibility of doing that per core and allow it only
system-wide.

This is a minimal fix which we'd like to see in stable too thus the
more-or-less arbitrary decision to allow system-wide reloading only on
the BSP:

$ echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/microcode/reload
...

and disable the interface on the other cores:

$ echo 1 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu23/microcode/reload
-bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument

Also, allowing the reload only from one CPU (the BSP in
that case) doesn't allow the reload procedure to degenerate
into an O(n^2) deal when triggering reloads from all
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuX/microcode/reload sysfs nodes
simultaneously.

A more generic fix will follow.
