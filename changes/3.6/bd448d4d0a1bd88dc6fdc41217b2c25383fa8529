x86, boot: Exclude cmdline.c if you can't use it

CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK is the only feature that might use command line
parsing in the decompression stage.  If it is disabled then we can
exclude the related code to save space. This can result in an estimated
space savings of 2240 bytes from the compressed kernel image.
