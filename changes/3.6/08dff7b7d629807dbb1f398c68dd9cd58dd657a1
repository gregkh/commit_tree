mm/hotplug: correctly add new zone to all other nodes' zone lists

When online_pages() is called to add new memory to an empty zone, it
rebuilds all zone lists by calling build_all_zonelists().  But there's a
bug which prevents the new zone to be added to other nodes' zone lists.

online_pages() {
	build_all_zonelists()
	.....
	node_set_state(zone_to_nid(zone), N_HIGH_MEMORY)
}

Here the node of the zone is put into N_HIGH_MEMORY state after calling
build_all_zonelists(), but build_all_zonelists() only adds zones from
nodes in N_HIGH_MEMORY state to the fallback zone lists.
build_all_zonelists()

    ->__build_all_zonelists()
	->build_zonelists()
	    ->find_next_best_node()
		->for_each_node_state(n, N_HIGH_MEMORY)

So memory in the new zone will never be used by other nodes, and it may
cause strange behavor when system is under memory pressure.  So put node
into N_HIGH_MEMORY state before calling build_all_zonelists().
