libceph: have messages point to their connection

When a ceph message is queued for sending it is placed on a list of
pending messages (ceph_connection->out_queue).  When they are
actually sent over the wire, they are moved from that list to
another (ceph_connection->out_sent).  When acknowledgement for the
message is received, it is removed from the sent messages list.

During that entire time the message is "in the possession" of a
single ceph connection.  Keep track of that connection in the
message.  This will be used in the next patch (and is a helpful
bit of information for debugging anyway).
