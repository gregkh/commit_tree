ipv4: Adjust semantics of rt->rt_gateway.

In order to allow prefixed routes, we have to adjust how rt_gateway
is set and interpreted.

The new interpretation is:

1) rt_gateway == 0, destination is on-link, nexthop is iph->daddr

2) rt_gateway != 0, destination requires a nexthop gateway

Abstract the fetching of the proper nexthop value using a new
inline helper, rt_nexthop(), as suggested by Joe Perches.
