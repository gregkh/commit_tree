staging: comedi: das08_cs: refactor the pcmcia probe/remove

Move the pcmcia_disable_device() call where needed in the pcmcia
probe/remove and delete the das08_pcmcia_release() function.

Move the logic of the das08_pcmcia_config() directly into the
probe function and properly return an error code when the config
fails.

Only set cur_dev, used by the comedi_driver, if the pcmcia probe
is successful. Also, make sure to NULL it in the remove.

Remove all the kernel messages in the pcmcia support code. They
are just added noise.
