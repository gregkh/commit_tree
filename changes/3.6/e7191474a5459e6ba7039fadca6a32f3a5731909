HID: uhid: forward open/close events to user-space

HID core notifies us with *_open/*_close callbacks when there is an actual
user of our device. We forward these to user-space so they can react on
this. This allows user-space to skip I/O unless they receive an OPEN
event. When they receive a CLOSE event they can stop I/O again to save
energy.
