MD RAID10: Export md_raid10_congested

md/raid10: Export is_congested test.

we export the RAID10 congestion checking function so that dm-raid.c can
make use of it and make use of the personality.  The 'queue' and 'gendisk'
structures will not be available to the MD code when device-mapper sets
up the device, so we conditionalize access to these fields also.
