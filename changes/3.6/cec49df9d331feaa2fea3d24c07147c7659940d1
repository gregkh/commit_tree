x86, boot: Exclude early_serial_console.c if can't use it.

Removes early_serial_console.c code if we don't have the config option that
enables it (EARLY_PRINTK). When disabling this code, make early_serial_base a
constant 0 to allow the compiler to optimize away the code that checks for
early_serial_base.
