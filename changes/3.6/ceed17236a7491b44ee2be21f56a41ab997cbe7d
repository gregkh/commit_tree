quota: Split dquot_quota_sync() to writeback and cache flushing part

Split off part of dquot_quota_sync() which writes dquots into a quota file
to a separate function. In the next patch we will use the function from
filesystems and we do not want to abuse ->quota_sync quotactl callback more
than necessary.
