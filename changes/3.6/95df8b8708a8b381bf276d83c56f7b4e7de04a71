PCI: fix undefined reference to 'pci_fixup_final_inited'

My "PCI: Integrate 'pci_fixup_final' quirks into hot-plug paths" patch
introduced an undefined reference to 'pci_fixup_final_inited' when
CONFIG_PCI_QUIRKS is not enabled (on x86_64):
  drivers/built-in.o: In function `pci_bus_add_device':
  (.text+0x4f62): undefined reference to `pci_fixup_final_inited'

This patch removes the external reference ending up with a result closer
to what we ultimately want when the boot path issues described in the
original patch are resolved.
