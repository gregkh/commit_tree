scripts/coccinelle: list iterator variable semantic patch

If list_for_each_entry, etc complete a traversal of the list, the iterator
variable ends up pointing to an address at an offset from the list head,
and not a meaningful structure.  Thus this value should not be used after
the end of the iterator.
