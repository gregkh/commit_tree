libceph: don't touch con state in con_close_socket()

In con_close_socket(), a connection's SOCK_CLOSED flag gets set and
then cleared while its shutdown method is called and its reference
gets dropped.

Previously, that flag got set only if it had not already been set,
so setting it in con_close_socket() might have prevented additional
processing being done on a socket being shut down.  We no longer set
SOCK_CLOSED in the socket event routine conditionally, so setting
that bit here no longer provides whatever benefit it might have
provided before.

A race condition could still leave the SOCK_CLOSED bit set even
after we've issued the call to con_close_socket(), so we still clear
that bit after shutting the socket down.  Add a comment explaining
the reason for this.
