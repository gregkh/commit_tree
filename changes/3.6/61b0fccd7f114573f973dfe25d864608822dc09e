x86/mce: Add quirk for instruction recovery on Sandy Bridge processors

Sandy Bridge processors follow the SDM (Vol 3B, Table 15-20) and
set both the RIPV and EIPV bits in the MCG_STATUS register to
zero for machine checks during instruction fetch. This is more
than a little counter-intuitive and means that Linux cannot
recover from these errors. Rather than insert special case code
at several places in mce.c and mce-severity.c, we pretend the
EIPV bit was set for just this case early in processing the
machine check.
