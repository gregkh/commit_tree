cfg80211: provide channel to join_mesh function

Just like the AP mode patch, instead of setting
the channel and then joining the mesh network,
provide the channel to join the network on to
the join_mesh() function.

Like in AP mode, you can also give the channel
to the join-mesh nl80211 command now.

Unlike AP mode, it picks a default channel if
none was given.

As libertas uses mesh mode interfaces but has
no join_mesh callback and we can't simply break
it, keep some compatibility code for that case
and configure the channel directly for it.

In the non-libertas case, where we store the
channel until join, allow setting it while the
interface is down.
