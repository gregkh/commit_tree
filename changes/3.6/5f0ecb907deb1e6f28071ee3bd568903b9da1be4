hwmon: (fam15h_power) Tweak runavg_range on resume

The quirk introduced with commit
00250ec90963b7ef6678438888f3244985ecde14 (hwmon: fam15h_power: fix
bogus values with current BIOSes) is not only required during driver
load but also when system resumes from suspend. The BIOS might set the
previously recommended (but unsuitable) initilization value for the
running average range register during resume.
