ALSA: hda - Add the inverted digital mic workaround to Realtek codecs

Some laptops are equipped with ForteMedia digital mics that give the
differential input.  With such devices, summing stereo streams into a
mono (like PulseAudio does) results in almost silence.

This patch provides a workaround for this bug by adding a new mixer
switch to turn on/off the right channel of digital mic, just like a
similar fix for Conexant codecs.

When the new switch "Inverted Internal Mic Capture Switch" is off and
the current input source is the digital mic, the right channel of the
recording stream is muted.  When another input source is selected, the
right channel is restored.
