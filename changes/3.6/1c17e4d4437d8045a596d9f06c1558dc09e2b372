rcu: Prevent uninitialized string in RCU CPU stall info

An uninitialized string may be displayed at the end of the rcu_preempt
detected stall info such as

0: (1 GPs behind) idle=075/140000000000000/0 =8?^D=8?^D
                                             ^^^^^^^^^^
if CONFIG_RCU_FAST_NO_HZ is not defined.

This trivial patch clears the string in this case.
