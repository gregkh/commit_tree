USB: EHCI: remove unneeded suspend/resume code

This patch (as1566) removes the code in ehci-hcd's resume routines
which tries to restart or cancel any transfers left active while the
root hub or controller was asleep.  This code isn't necessary, because
all URBs are terminated before the root hub is suspended.
