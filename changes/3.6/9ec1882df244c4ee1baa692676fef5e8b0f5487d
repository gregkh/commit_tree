tty: serial: imx: console write routing is unsafe on SMP

The console feature's write routing is unsafe on SMP with
the startup/shutdown call.

There could be several consumers of the console
* the kernel printk
* the init process using /dev/kmsg to call printk to show log
* shell, which open /dev/console and write with sys_write()

The shell goes into the normal uart open/write routing,
but the other two go into the console operations.
The open routing calls imx serial startup, which will write USR1/2
register without any lock and critical with imx_console_write call.

Add a spin_lock for startup/shutdown/console_write routing.

This patch is a port from Freescale's Android kernel.
