clk: add non CONFIG_HAVE_CLK routines

Many drivers are shared between architectures that may or may not have
HAVE_CLK selected for them.  To remove compilation errors for them we
enclose clk_*() calls in these drivers within #ifdef CONFIG_HAVE_CLK,
#endif.

This patch removes the need of these CONFIG_HAVE_CLK statements, by
introducing dummy routines when HAVE_CLK is not selected by platforms.
So, definition of these routines will always be available.  These calls
will return error for platforms that don't select HAVE_CLK.
