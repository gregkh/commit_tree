raid5: remove unnecessary bitmap write optimization

Neil pointed out the bitmap write optimization in handle_stripe_clean_event()
is unnecessary, because the chance one stripe gets written twice in the mean
time is rare. We can always do a bitmap_startwrite when a write request is
added to a stripe and bitmap_endwrite after write request is done.  Delete the
optimization. With it, we can delete some cases of device_lock.
