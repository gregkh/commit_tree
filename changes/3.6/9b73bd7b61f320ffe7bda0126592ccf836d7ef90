xfs: factor buffer reading from xfs_dir2_leaf_getdents

The buffer reading code in xfs_dir2_leaf_getdents is complex and difficult to
follow due to the readahead and all the context is carries. it is also badly
indented and so difficult to read. Factor it out into a separate function to
make it easier to understand and optimise in future patches.
