ath9k: raise aggregation limit to 64k for HT IBSS

mac80211 adds stations in HT IBSS as soon as a frame comes by,
even if the HT capabilities are not known yet (they are often
received later, e.g. in beacons). So far, ampdu factor/density
are only calculated when the station is initially added.

This patch changes this to update ampdu factor/density settings
when starting a blockack session.

Using this patch, we had performance boosts from 60 to 150 MBit/s
between two 2x2 Atheros devices in 5 GHz HT IBSS mode.
