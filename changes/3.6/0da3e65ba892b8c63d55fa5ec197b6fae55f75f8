leds: Rename led_set_brightness() to __led_set_brightness()

Rename leds internal interface led_set_brightness() to __led_set_brightness()
to reduce confusion between led_set_brightness() and the external interface
led_brightness_set(). led_brightness_set() cancels the timer and then calls
led_set_brightness().
