md/raid5: For odirect-write performance, do not set STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE.

'sync' writes set both REQ_SYNC and REQ_NOIDLE.
O_DIRECT writes set REQ_SYNC but not REQ_NOIDLE.

We currently assume that a REQ_SYNC request will not be followed by
more requests and so set STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE to expedite the
request.
This is appropriate for sync requests, but not for O_DIRECT requests.

So make the setting of STRIPE_PREREAD_ACTIVE conditional on REQ_NOIDLE
rather than REQ_SYNC.  This is consistent with the documented meaning
of REQ_NOIDLE:

        __REQ_NOIDLE,           /* don't anticipate more IO after this one */
