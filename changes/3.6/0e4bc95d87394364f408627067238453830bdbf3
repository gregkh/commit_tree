powerpc/iommu: Reduce spinlock coverage in iommu_alloc and iommu_free

We currently hold the IOMMU spinlock around tce_build and tce_flush.
This causes our spinlock hold times to be much higher than required
and can impact multiqueue adapters.

This patch moves tce_build and tce_flush outside of the lock in
iommu_alloc, and tce_flush outside of the lock in iommu_free.

Some performance numbers were obtained with a Chelsio T3 adapter on
two POWER7 boxes, running a 100 session TCP round robin test.

Performance improved 32% with this patch applied.
