ASoC: tegra+wm8903: simplify gpio tests in widget callbacks

By the time any widget callbacks could be called, if the GPIO ID they
will manipulate is valid, it must have already been requested, or the
card would have failed to probe or initialize. So, testing for GPIO
validity is equivalent to testing whether the GPIO was successfully
requested at this point in the code. Making this change will allow later
patches to remove the gpio_requested variable.
