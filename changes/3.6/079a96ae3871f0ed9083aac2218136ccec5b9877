ipc: add COMPAT_SHMLBA support

If the SHMLBA definition for a native task differs from the definition for
a compat task, the do_shmat() function would need to handle both.

This patch introduces COMPAT_SHMLBA, which is used by the compat shmat
syscall when calling the ipc code and allows architectures such as AArch64
(where the native SHMLBA is 64k but the compat (AArch32) definition is
16k) to provide the correct semantics for compat IPC system calls.
