time: Fix adjustment cleanup bug in timekeeping_adjust()

Tetsuo Handa reported that sporadically the system clock starts
counting up too quickly which is enough to confuse the hangcheck
timer to print a bogus stall warning.

Commit 2a8c0883 "time: Move xtime_nsec adjustment underflow handling
timekeeping_adjust" overlooked this exit path:

        } else
                return;

which should really be a proper exit sequence, fixing the bug as a
side effect.

Also make the flow more readable by properly balancing curly
braces.
