powerpc: Disable /dev/port interface on systems without an ISA bridge

Some power systems do not have legacy ISA devices. So, /dev/port is not
a valid interface on these systems. User level tools such as kbdrate is
trying to access the device using this interface which is causing the
system crash.

This patch will fix this issue by not creating this interface on these
powerpc systems.
