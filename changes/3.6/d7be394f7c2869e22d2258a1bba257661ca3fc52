staging: zcache: don't limit number of pools per client

Currently the amount of pools each client can use is limited to 16, this is
and arbitrary limit which isn't really required by current implementation.

This places and arbitrary limit on the number of mounted filesystems that
can use cleancache.

This patch removes that limit and uses IDR to do sparse mapping of pools
in each client.
