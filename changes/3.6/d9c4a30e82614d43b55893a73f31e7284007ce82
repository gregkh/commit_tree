uprobes: Move BUG_ON(UPROBE_SWBP_INSN_SIZE) from write_opcode() to install_breakpoint()

write_opcode() ensures that UPROBE_SWBP_INSN doesn't cross the
page boundary. This looks a bit confusing, the check does not
depend on vaddr and it is enough to do it only once right after
install_breakpoint()->arch_uprobe_analyze_insn().
