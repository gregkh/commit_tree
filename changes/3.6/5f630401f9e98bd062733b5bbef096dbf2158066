powerpc/kgdb: Restore current_thread_info properly

For powerpc BooKE and e200, singlestep is handled on the critical/dbg
exception stack. This causes current_thread_info() to fail for kgdb
internal, so previously We work around this issue by copying
the thread_info from the kernel stack before calling kgdb_handle_exception,
and copying it back afterwards.

But actually we don't do this properly. We should backup current_thread_info
then restore that when exit.
