i2c: tegra: make sure register writes completes

The Tegra PPSB (an peripheral bus) queues writes transactions.
In order to guarantee that writes have completed before a
certain time, a read transaction to a register on the same
bus must be executed.
This is necessary in situations such as when clearing an
interrupt status or enable, so that when returning from an
interrupt handler, the HW has already de-asserted its
interrupt status output, which will avoid spurious interrupts.
