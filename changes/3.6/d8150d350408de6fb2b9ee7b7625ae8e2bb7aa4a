PM / Hibernate: Print hibernation/thaw progress indicator one line at a time.

With the introduction of suspend to both into in-kernel hibernation
code, dmesg was getting polluted with backspace characters printed as
part of image saving progress indicator. This patch introduces printing
of progress indicator on image save/load every 10% and one line at a
time. As an additional benefit, all other messages emitted by the kernel
during hibernation/thaw should now print cleanly as well.
