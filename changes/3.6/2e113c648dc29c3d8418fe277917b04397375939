ARM: OMAP2+: control: Add AM33XX control reg & sec clkctrl offset

Define AM33XX control register, in order to allow access to
control register address space, also add CONTROL_SEC_CLK_CTRL
register offset; both are required in clock tree data,
for wdt0 and timer0 clock source select configuration.

CONTROL.SEC_CLK_CTRL register is provided to select/configure
clock input for WDT0 and TIMER0.
