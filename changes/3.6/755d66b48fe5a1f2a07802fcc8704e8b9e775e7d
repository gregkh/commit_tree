pstore/ram: Factor ramoops_get_next_prz() out of ramoops_pstore_read()

This will help make code clearer when we'll add support for other
message types.

The patch also changes return value from -EINVAL to 0 in case of
end-of-records. The exact value doesn't matter for pstore (it should
be just <= 0), but 0 feels more correct.
