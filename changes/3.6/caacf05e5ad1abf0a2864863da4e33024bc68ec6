ipv4: Properly purge netdev references on uncached routes.

When a device is unregistered, we have to purge all of the
references to it that may exist in the entire system.

If a route is uncached, we currently have no way of accomplishing
this.

So create a global list that is scanned when a network device goes
down.  This mirrors the logic in net/core/dst.c's dst_ifdown().
