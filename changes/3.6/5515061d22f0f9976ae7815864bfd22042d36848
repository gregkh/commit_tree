mm: throttle direct reclaimers if PF_MEMALLOC reserves are low and swap is backed by network storage

If swap is backed by network storage such as NBD, there is a risk that a
large number of reclaimers can hang the system by consuming all
PF_MEMALLOC reserves.  To avoid these hangs, the administrator must tune
min_free_kbytes in advance which is a bit fragile.

This patch throttles direct reclaimers if half the PF_MEMALLOC reserves
are in use.  If the system is routinely getting throttled the system
administrator can increase min_free_kbytes so degradation is smoother but
the system will keep running.
