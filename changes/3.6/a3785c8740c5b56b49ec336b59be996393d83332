target/pscsi: Only emulate REPORT_LUNS for passthrough

This patch changes back the pSCSI backend to follow pre 3.6-queue code to
passthrough SPC-3 persistent reservations + SPC-2 legacy reservation
handling to the underlying LLD / physical hardware.

For folks who really need this for their own SPC-3 emulation logic, avoid
changing the functionality of this beyond what is exported for REPORT_LUNS
for existing code, and to avoid problems with SPC-3 PR/ALUA as INQUIRY
EVPD=0x83 emulation needs to be in place in order for this to work as
expected with spc_parse_cdb() code..
