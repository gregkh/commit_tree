ipv4: Calling ->cow_metrics() now is a bug.

Nothing every writes to ipv4 metrics any longer.

PMTU is stored in rt->rt_pmtu.

Dynamic TCP metrics are stored in a special TCP metrics cache,
completely outside of the routes.

Therefore ->cow_metrics() can simply nothing more than a WARN_ON
trigger so we can catch anyone who tries to add new writes to
ipv4 route metrics.
