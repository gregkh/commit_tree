drm/i915: reorder edp disabling to fix ivb MacBook Air

eDP is tons of fun. It turns out that at least the new MacBook Air 5,1
model absolutely doesn't like the new force vdd dance we've introduced
in

    drm/i915: enable vdd when switching off the eDP panel

But that patch also tried to fix some neat edp sequence issue with the
force_vdd timings. Closer inspection reveals that we've raised
force_vdd only to do the aux channel communication dp_sink_dpms. If we
move the edp_panel_off below that, we don't need any force_vdd for the
disable sequence, which makes the Air happy.

Unfortunately the reporter of the original bug that the above commit
fixed is travelling, so we can't test whether this regresses things.
But my theory is that since we don't check for any power-off ->
force_vdd-on delays in edp_panel_vdd_on, this was the actual
root-cause of this failure. With that force_vdd dance completely
eliminated, I'm hopeful the original bug stays fixed, too.

For reference the old bug, which hopefully doesn't get broken by this:

In any case, regression fixers win over plain bugfixes, so this needs
to go in asap.

v2: The crucial pieces seems to be to clear the force_vdd flag
uncoditionally, too, in edp_panel_off. Looks like this is left behind
by the firmware somehow.

v3: The Apple firmware seems to switch off the panel on it's own, hence
we still need to keep force_vdd on, but properly clear it when switching
the panel off.
