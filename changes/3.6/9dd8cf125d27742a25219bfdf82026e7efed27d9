ALSA: hda - Don't rely on event tag for simple_hdmi

VIA codecs seem not returning the event tag in the unsolicited events,
thus the current code relying on the tag value doesn't work.
Since simple_hdmi stuff has only a single pin, we can use simply
snd_hda_jack_set_dirty_all() to activate the pin-detection
independently from the tag value.
