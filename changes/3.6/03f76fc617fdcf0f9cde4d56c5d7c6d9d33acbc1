staging/xgifb: Replace delay lookup tables with constant values

For TV Devices:
The values taken from XGI_TVDelayList are always overwritten with the
values from XGI_TVDelayList2 since the if condition for using the values
from XGI_TVDelayList2 is identical with the check to enter this scope and
thus always true.
The delay values in XGI_TVDelayList2 is always 0x22 so we
can simply replace it with this constant value.

For LCD Devices:
The LCD_DelayCompensation field is always set to 0x12 so we can simply
replace this field with a constant value.

This saves about 500 bytes in compiled size.
