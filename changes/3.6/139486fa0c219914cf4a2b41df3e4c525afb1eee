ARM: OMAP2+: HWMOD: Correct timer device attributes

Fix the following issues with the timer device attributes for OMAP2+ devices:

1. For OMAP24xx devices, timers 2-8 have the ALWAYS-ON attribute indicating
   that these timers are in an ALWAYS-ON power domain. This is not the case
   only timer1 is in an ALWAYS-ON power domain.
2. For OMAP3xxx devices, timers 2-7 have the ALWAYS-ON attribute indicating
   that these timers are in an ALWAYS-ON power domain. This is not the case
   only timer1 and timer12 are in an ALWAYS-ON power domain.
3. For OMAP3xxx devices, timer12 does not have the ALWAYS-ON attribute but
   is in an always-on power domain.
