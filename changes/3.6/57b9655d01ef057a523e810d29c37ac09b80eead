udf: Improve table length check to avoid possible overflow

When a partition table length is corrupted to be close to 1 << 32, the
check for its length may overflow on 32-bit systems and we will think
the length is valid. Later on the kernel can crash trying to read beyond
end of buffer. Fix the check to avoid possible overflow.
