sfc: Disable VF queues during register self-test

Currently VF queues and drivers may remain active during this test.
This could cause memory corruption or spurious test failures.
Therefore we reset the port/function before running these tests on
Siena.

On Falcon this doesn't work: we have to do some additional
initialisation before some blocks will work again.  So refactor the
reset/register-test sequence into an efx_nic_type method so
efx_selftest() doesn't have to consider such quirks.

In the process, fix another minor bug: Siena does not have an
'invisible' reset and the self-test currently fails to push the PHY
configuration after resetting.  Passing RESET_TYPE_ALL to
efx_reset_{down,up}() fixes this.
