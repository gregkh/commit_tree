rcu: Disable preemption in rcu_blocking_is_gp()

It is time to optimize CONFIG_TREE_PREEMPT_RCU's synchronize_rcu()
for uniprocessor optimization, which means that rcu_blocking_is_gp()
can no longer rely on RCU read-side critical sections having disabled
preemption.  This commit therefore disables preemption across
rcu_blocking_is_gp()'s scan of the cpu_online_mask.

(Updated from previous version to fix embarrassing bug spotted by
Wu Fengguang.)
