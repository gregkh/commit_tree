random: Add comment to random_initialize()

Many platforms have per-machine instance data (serial numbers,
asset tags, etc.) squirreled away in areas that are accessed
during early system bringup. Mixing this data into the random
pools has a very high value in providing better random data,
so we should allow (and even encourage) architecture code to
call add_device_randomness() from the setup_arch() paths.

However, this limits our options for internal structure of
the random driver since random_initialize() is not called
until long after setup_arch().

Add a big fat comment to rand_initialize() spelling out
this requirement.
