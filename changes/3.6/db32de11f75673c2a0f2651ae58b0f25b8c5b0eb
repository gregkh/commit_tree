Revert "usb/uas: one only one status URB/host on stream-less connection"

This reverts commit ceb3f91fd53c9fbd7b292fc2754ba4efffeeeedb.

IMO the real bug is assigning status urbs to scsi requests.  First there
is no such link in the non-stream case.  Also there isn't nessesarely a
scsi request in the first place, for example when submitting task
management requests.

This patch just papers over the real bug and introduces different status
urb handling in the stream/non-stream case for no good reason.
