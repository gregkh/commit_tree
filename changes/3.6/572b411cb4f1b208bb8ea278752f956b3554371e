powerpc/kgdb: Do not set kgdb_single_step on ppc

The kgdb_single_step flag has the possibility to indefinitely
hang the system on an SMP system.

The x86 arch have the same problem, and that problem was fixed by
commit 8097551d9ab9b9e3630(kgdb,x86: do not set kgdb_single_step
on x86). This patch does the same behaviors as x86's patch.
