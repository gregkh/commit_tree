pstore: Headers should include all stuff they use

Headers should really include all the needed prototypes, types, defines
etc. to be self-contained. This is a long-standing issue, but apparently
the new tracing code unearthed it (SMP=n is also a prerequisite):

In file included from fs/pstore/internal.h:4:0,
                 from fs/pstore/ftrace.c:21:
include/linux/pstore.h:43:15: error: field ‘read_mutex’ has incomplete type

While at it, I also added the following:

linux/types.h -> size_t, phys_addr_t, uXX and friends
linux/spinlock.h -> spinlock_t
linux/errno.h -> Exxxx
linux/time.h -> struct timespec (struct passed by value)
struct module and rs_control forward declaration (passed via pointers).
