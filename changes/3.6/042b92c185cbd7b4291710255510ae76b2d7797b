ALSA: hda - Do not set GPIOs for speakers on IDT if there are no speakers

This fixes an issue with a machine where there were no speakers,
but GPIO0 had to be data=1 for the headphone to be functioning.

I'm not sure if we need a more advanced patch to solve all possible cases,
but if so, this patch would still provide a minor optimisation.
