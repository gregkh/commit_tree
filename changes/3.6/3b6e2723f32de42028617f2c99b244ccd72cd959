locks: prevent side-effects of locks_release_private before file_lock is initialized

When calling fcntl(fd, F_SETLEASE, lck) [with lck=F_WRLCK or F_RDLCK],
the custom signal or owner (if any were previously set using F_SETSIG
or F_SETOWN fcntls) would be reset when F_SETLEASE was called for the
second time on the same file descriptor.

This bug is a regression of 2.6.37 and is described here:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=43336

This patch reverts a commit from Oct 2004 (with subject "nfs4 lease:
move the f_delown processing") which originally introduced the
lm_release_private callback.
