perf/trace: Add ability to set a target task for events

A few events are interesting not only for a current task.
For example, sched_stat_* events are interesting for a task
which wakes up. For this reason, it will be good if such
events will be delivered to a target task too.

Now a target task can be set by using __perf_task().

The original idea and a draft patch belongs to Peter Zijlstra.

I need these events for profiling sleep times. sched_switch is used for
getting callchains and sched_stat_* is used for getting time periods.
These events are combined in user space, then it can be analyzed by
perf tools.
