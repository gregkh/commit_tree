sparc64: do not clobber personality flags in sys_sparc64_personality()

There are multiple errors in how sys_sparc64_personality() handles
personality flags stored in top three bytes.

- directly comparing current->personality against PER_LINUX32 doesn't work
  in cases when any of the personality flags stored in the top three bytes
  are used.
- directly forcefully setting personality to PER_LINUX32 or PER_LINUX
  discards any flags stored in the top three bytes

Fix the first one by properly using personality() macro to compare only
PER_MASK bytes.
Fix the second one by setting only the bits that should be set, instead of
overwriting the whole value.
