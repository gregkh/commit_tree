tipc: use standard printk shortcut macros (pr_err etc.)

All messages should go directly to the kernel log.  The TIPC
specific error, warning, info and debug trace macro's are
removed and all references replaced with pr_err, pr_warn,
pr_info and pr_debug.

Commonly used sub-strings are explicitly declared as a const
char to reduce .text size.

Note that this means the debug messages (changed to pr_debug),
are now enabled through dynamic debugging, instead of a TIPC
specific Kconfig option (TIPC_DEBUG).  The latter will be
phased out completely
