staging/xgifb: Add mutext for fb_mmap locking

This adds a mutex for fb_mmap around smem_start and smem_len
so the mutex inside the fb_mmap() is actually used.  Changing of
these fields before calling the framebuffer_register() are not mutexed.

We check whether framebuffer_register has been called by reading
fbinfo->count.

See 537a1bf0 - "fbdev: add mutex for fb_mmap locking" by Krzysztof Helt
for details.
