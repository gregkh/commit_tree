tcp: Maintain dynamic metrics in local cache.

Maintain a local hash table of TCP dynamic metrics blobs.

Computed TCP metrics are no longer maintained in the route metrics.

The table uses RCU and an extremely simple hash so that it has low
latency and low overhead.  A simple hash is legitimate because we only
make metrics blobs for fully established connections.

Some tweaking of the default hash table sizes, metric timeouts, and
the hash chain length limit certainly could use some tweaking.  But
the basic design seems sound.

With help from Eric Dumazet and Joe Perches.
