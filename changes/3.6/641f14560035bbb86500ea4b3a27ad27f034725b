hwmon: (coretemp) Use get_online_cpus to avoid races involving CPU hotplug

coretemp_init loops with for_each_online_cpu, adding platform_devices
and sysfs interfaces, then calls register_hotcpu_notifier.  There is a
race if a CPU is offlined or onlined after the loop, but before
register_hotcpu_notifier.  The race might result in the absence of a
platform_device+sysfs interface for an online CPU, or the presence of
a platform_device+sysfs interface for an offline CPU.  A similar race
occurs during coretemp_exit, after the module calls
unregister_hotcpu_notifier, but before it unregisters all devices, a
CPU might offline and a device for an offline CPU will exist for a
short while.

This fix surrounds for_each_online_cpu and register_hotcpu_notifier
with get_online_cpus+put_online_cpus; and surrounds
unregister_hotcpu_notifier and device unregistering with
get_online_cpus+put_online_cpus.

Build tested.
