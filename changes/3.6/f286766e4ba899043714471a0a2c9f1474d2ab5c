staging: comedi: remove comedi_fops.h

Move the contents of "comedi_fops.h" into "comedi_internal.h" and delete
"comedi_fops.h". It only contains a couple of external variable
declarations (and #include <linux/types.h>) and one of those isn't even
declared in "comedi_fops.c".  The other one is an external declaration
of a variable used to store a module parameter and some of those are
already externally declared in "comedi_internal.h", so they can keep it
company!
