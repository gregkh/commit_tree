MIPS: Add CPU support for Loongson1B

Loongson 1B is a 32-bit SoC designed by Institute of Computing Technology
(ICT) and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), which implements the
MIPS32 release 2 instruction set.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: But which is not strictly a MIPS32 compliant device
which also is why it identifies itself with the Legacy Vendor ID in the
PrID register.  When applying the patch I shoveled some code around to
keep things in alphabetical order and avoid forward declarations.]
