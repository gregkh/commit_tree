vsprintf: add support of '%*ph[CDN]'

There are many places in the kernel where the drivers print small buffers
as a hex string.  This patch adds a support of the variable width buffer
to print it as a hex string with a delimiter.  The idea came from Pavel
Roskin here: http://www.digipedia.pl/usenet/thread/18835/17449/

Sample output of
	pr_info("buf[%d:%d] %*phC\n", from, len, len, &buf[from]);
could be look like this:
	[ 0.726130] buf[51:8] e8:16:b6:ef:e3:74:45:6e
	[ 0.750736] buf[59:15] 31:81:b8:3f:35:49:06:ae:df:32:06:05:4a:af:55
	[ 0.757602] buf[17:5] ac:16:d5:2c:ef
