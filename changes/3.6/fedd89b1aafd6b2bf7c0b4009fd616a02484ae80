regulator: palmas: Slightly code change for better readability

It's a little bit hard to read that the "else" case means id == PALMAS_REG_SMPS10.

if (id != PALMAS_REG_SMPS10){
        do something for the cases id != PALMAS_REG_SMPS10;
} else {
        do something for the case id == PALMAS_REG_SMPS10;
}

This patch changes above syntax to switch statement.
