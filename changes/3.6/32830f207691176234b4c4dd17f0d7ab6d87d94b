USB: EHCI: use hrtimer for unlinking empty async QHs

This patch (as1583) changes ehci-hcd to use an hrtimer event for
unlinking empty (unused) async QHs instead of using a kernel timer.

The check for empty QHs is moved to a new routine, where it doesn't
require going through an entire scan of both the async and periodic
schedules.  And it can unlink multiple QHs at once, unlike the current
code.
