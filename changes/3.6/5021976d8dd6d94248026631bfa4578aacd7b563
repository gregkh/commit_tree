Btrfs: remove unwanted printk() for btrfs device I/O stats

People complained about the annoying kernel log message
"btrfs: no dev_stats entry found ... (OK on first mount after mkfs)"
everytime a filesystem is mounted for the first time after running
mkfs. Since the distribution of the btrfs-progs is not synchronized
to the kernel version, mkfs like it is now will be used also in the
future. Then this message is not useful to find errors, it is just
annoying. This commit removes the printk().
