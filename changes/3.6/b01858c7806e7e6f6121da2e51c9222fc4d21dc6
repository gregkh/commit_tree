ARM: S3C24XX: Fix s3c2410_dma_enqueue parameters

Commit d670ac019f60 (ARM: SAMSUNG: DMA Cleanup as per sparse) changed the
prototype of the s3c2410_dma_* functions to use the enum dma_ch instead
of an generic unsigned int.

In the s3c24xx dma.c s3c2410_dma_enqueue seems to have been forgotten,
the other functions there were changed correctly.
