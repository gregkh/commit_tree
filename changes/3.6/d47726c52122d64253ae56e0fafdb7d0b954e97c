i2c: Add SCCB support

SCCB is a serial communication bus developed by Omnivision. Its 2-wire
mode is very similar to SMBus byte data transactions, but requires the
controller to ignore the ACK bit and to insert a stop condition after
each message.

Add a device SCCB flag and a message stop flag to be passed to
controller drivers.
