PCI: leave MEM and IO decoding disabled during 64-bit BAR sizing, too

After 253d2e5498, we disable MEM and IO decoding for most devices while we
size 32-bit BARs.  However, we restore the original COMMAND register before
we size the upper 32 bits of 64-bit BARs, so we can still cause a conflict.

This patch waits to restore the original COMMAND register until we're
completely finished sizing the BAR.
