hwmon: Honeywell Humidicon HIH-6130/HIH-6131 humidity and temperature sensor driver

This is a new driver for the Honeywell Humidicon HIH-6130/HIH-6131 humidity sensor.

The driver is based on the existing Sensiron sht21 driver with the necessary changes
to the probe, update_measurements and conversion functions necessary to use the
Honeywell sensors.

There's no difference between the 6130 & 6131 other than the 6131 having an external
condensation filter attached.
