drm/radeon: fix non revealent error message

We want to print link status query failed only if it's
an unexepected fail. If we query to see if we need
link training it might be because there is nothing
connected and thus link status query have the right
to fail in that case.

To avoid printing failure when it's expected, move the
failure message to proper place.
