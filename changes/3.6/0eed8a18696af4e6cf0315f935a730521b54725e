ASoC: Convert S3C24XX I2S driver to gpiolib API

The s3c2410_gpio* calls are obsolete and have been scheduled for
removal since several kernel releases. Remove them and use common
gpiolib API.
This patch is a prerequisite for removal of the obsolete S3C24XX
SoC GPIO definitions.

Tested on Micro2440-SDK.
