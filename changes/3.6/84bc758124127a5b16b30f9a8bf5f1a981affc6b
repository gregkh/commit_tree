drm/i915: l3 parity sysfs interface

Dumb binary interfaces which allow root-only updates of the cache
remapping registers. As mentioned in a previous patch, software using
this interface needs to know about HW limits, and other programming
considerations as the kernel interface does no checking for these things
on the root-only interface.

v1: Drop extra posting reads (Chris)
Return negative values in the sysfs interfaces on errors (Chris)

v2: Return -EINVAL for offset % 4 (Jesse)
Move schizo userspace check out (Jesse)
Cleaner sysfs item initializers (Daniel)
