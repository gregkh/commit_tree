mm, oom: replace some information in tasklist dump

The number of ptes and swap entries are used in the oom killer's badness
heuristic, so they should be shown in the tasklist dump.

This patch adds those fields and replaces cpu and oom_adj values that are
currently emitted.  Cpu isn't interesting and oom_adj is deprecated and
will be removed later this year, the same information is already displayed
as oom_score_adj which is used internally.

At the same time, make the documentation a little more clear to state this
information is helpful to determine why the oom killer chose the task it
did to kill.
