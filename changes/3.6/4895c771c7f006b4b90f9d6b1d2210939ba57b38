ipv4: Add FIB nexthop exceptions.

In a regime where we have subnetted route entries, we need a way to
store persistent storage about destination specific learned values
such as redirects and PMTU values.

This is implemented here via nexthop exceptions.

The initial implementation is a 2048 entry hash table with relaiming
starting at chain length 5.  A more sophisticated scheme can be
devised if that proves necessary.
