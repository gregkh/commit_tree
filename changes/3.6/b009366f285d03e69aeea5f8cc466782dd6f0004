ARM: OMAP: counter-32k: Select the CR register offset using the IP scheme

OMAP socs has a legacy and a highlander version of the
32k sync counter IP. The register offsets vary between the
highlander and the legacy scheme. So use the 'SCHEME'
bits(30-31) of the revision register to distinguish between
the two versions and choose the CR register offset accordingly.
