staging: comedi: amplc_pci224: Replace printk calls

Replace the printk calls with dev_info, dev_err, etc.  There were some
consecutive printk calls without newlines which now scnprintf into a
temporary buffer and this bit of code has been factored out into new
function pci224_report_attach().

A couple of DPRINTK() macro calls which may result in printk() calls
have been left alone to be tackled en masse at a later date.
