nl80211: prepare for non-netdev wireless devs

In order to support a P2P device abstraction and
Bluetooth high-speed AMPs, we need to have a way
to identify virtual interfaces that don't have a
netdev associated.

Do this by adding a NL80211_ATTR_WDEV attribute
to identify a wdev which may or may not also be
a netdev.

To simplify things, use a 64-bit value with the
high 32 bits being the wiphy index for this new
wdev identifier in the nl80211 API.
