drm/i915: don't chnage the original mode in dp_mode_fixup

We should only frob adjusted_mode. This is in preparation of
a massive patch by Laurent Pinchart to make the mode argument
const.

After the previous two prep patches the only thing left is to clean up
things a bit. I've opted to pass in an adjust_mode param to
dp_adjust_dithering because that way we can be sure to avoid
duplicating this logic between mode_valid and mode_fixup - which was
the cause behind a dp link bw calculation bug in the past.

Also mark the mode argument of pch_panel_fitting const.

v2: Split up the mode->clock => adjusted_mode->clock change,
as suggested by Chris Wilson.
