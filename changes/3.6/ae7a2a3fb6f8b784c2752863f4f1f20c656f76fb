KVM: host side for eoi optimization

Implementation of PV EOI using shared memory.
This reduces the number of exits an interrupt
causes as much as by half.

The idea is simple: there's a bit, per APIC, in guest memory,
that tells the guest that it does not need EOI.
We set it before injecting an interrupt and clear
before injecting a nested one. Guest tests it using
a test and clear operation - this is necessary
so that host can detect interrupt nesting -
and if set, it can skip the EOI MSR.

There's a new MSR to set the address of said register
in guest memory. Otherwise not much changed:
- Guest EOI is not required
- Register is tested & ISR is automatically cleared on exit

For testing results see description of previous patch
'kvm_para: guest side for eoi avoidance'.
