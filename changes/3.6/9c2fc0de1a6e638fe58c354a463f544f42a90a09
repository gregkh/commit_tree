udf: Fix data corruption for files in ICB

When a file is stored in ICB (inode), we overwrite part of the file, and
the page containing file's data is not in page cache, we end up corrupting
file's data by overwriting them with zeros. The problem is we use
simple_write_begin() which simply zeroes parts of the page which are not
written to. The problem has been introduced by be021ee4 (udf: convert to
new aops).

Fix the problem by providing a ->write_begin function which makes the page
properly uptodate.
