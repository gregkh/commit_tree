quota: Move quota syncing to ->sync_fs method

Since the moment writes to quota files are using block device page cache and
space for quota structures is reserved at the moment they are first accessed we
have no reason to sync quota before inode writeback. In fact this order is now
only harmful since quota information can easily change during inode writeback
(either because conversion of delayed-allocated extents or simply because of
allocation of new blocks for simple filesystems not using page_mkwrite).

So move syncing of quota information after writeback of inodes into ->sync_fs
method. This way we do not have to use ->quota_sync callback which is primarily
intended for use by quotactl syscall anyway and we get rid of calling
->sync_fs() twice unnecessarily. We skip quota syncing for OCFS2 since it does
proper quota journalling in all cases (unlike ext3, ext4, and reiserfs which
also support legacy non-journalled quotas) and thus there are no dirty quota
structures.
