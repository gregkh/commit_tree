thinkpad-acpi: recognize latest V-Series using DMI_BIOS_VENDOR

In the latest V-series bios DMI_PRODUCT_VERSION does not contain
the string Lenovo or Thinkpad, but is set to the model number, this
causes the thinkpad_acpi module to fail to load. Recognize laptop
as Lenovo using DMI_BIOS_VENDOR instead, which is set to Lenovo.

Test on V490u

== Before the patch ==
sudo modprobe thinkpad_acpi
FATAL: Error inserting thinkpad_acpi (/lib/modules/3.2.0-27-generic/kernel/drivers/platform/x86/thinkpad_acpi.ko): No such device

Test on B485
=============
This patch was also test in a B485 where the thinkpad_acpi module does not
have any issues loading. But, I tested it to make sure this patch does not
break on already functioning models of Lenovo products.
