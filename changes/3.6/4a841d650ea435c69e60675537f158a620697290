perf tools: Make the breakpoint events sample period default to 1

There have one problem about hw_breakpoint perf event, as watched, the
events reported to userspace is not correctly, sometime one trigger
bp_event report several events, sometime bp_event cannot go through to
user.

The root cause is attr->freq is 1 passed to kernel defaultly in bp
events, this make kernel calculate event period not as expect, make
sample period to 1 will change attr->freq to 0, to fix this problem.

This patch is similar with commit f92128 about tracepoint events:
    perf: Make the trace events sample period default to 1
