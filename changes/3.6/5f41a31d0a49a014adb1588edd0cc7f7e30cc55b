target: remove the execute list

Since "target: Drop se_device TCQ queue_depth usage from I/O path" we always
submit all commands (or back then, tasks) from __transport_execute_tasks.

That means the the execute list has lots its purpose, as we can simply
submit the commands that are restarted in transport_complete_task_attr
directly while we walk the list.  In fact doing so also solves a race
in the way it currently walks to delayed_cmd_list as well.
