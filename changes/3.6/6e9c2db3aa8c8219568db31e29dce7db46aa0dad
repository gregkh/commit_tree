netfilter: fix compilation of the nfnl_cthelper if NF_CONNTRACK is unset

This patch fixes the compilation of net/netfilter/nfnetlink_cthelper.c
if CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK is not set.

This patch also moves the definition of the cthelper infrastructure to
the scope of NF_CONNTRACK things.

I have also renamed NETFILTER_NETLINK_CTHELPER by NF_CT_NETLINK_HELPER,
to use similar names to other nf_conntrack_netlink extensions. Better now
that this has been only for two days in David's tree.

Two new dependencies have been added:

* NF_CT_NETLINK
* NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE

Since these infrastructure requires both ctnetlink and nfqueue.
