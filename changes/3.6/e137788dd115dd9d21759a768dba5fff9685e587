mmc: add a function to get regulators, supplying card's power

Add a function to get regulators, supplying card's Vdd and Vccq on a
specific host. If a Vdd supplying regulator is found, the function checks,
whether a valid OCR mask can be obtained from it. The Vccq regulator is
optional. A failure to get it is not fatal.
