mm: prepare for removal of obsolete /proc/sys/vm/nr_pdflush_threads

Since per-BDI flusher threads were introduced in 2.6, the pdflush
mechanism is not used any more.  But the old interface exported through
/proc/sys/vm/nr_pdflush_threads still exists and is obviously useless.

For back-compatibility, printk warning information and return 2 to notify
the users that the interface is removed.
