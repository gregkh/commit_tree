tpm_tis: Use struct dev_pm_ops for power management

Make the tpm_tis driver define its PM callbacks through
a struct dev_pm_ops object rather than by using legacy PM hooks
in struct platform_driver.

This allows the driver to use tpm_pm_suspend() as its suspend
callback directly, without defining its own suspend callback
routine.
