ASoC: mxs-saif: fix clock prepare and enable unbalance issue

Currently we directly call a clock_enable in trigger function without
a clk_prepare as pair first.
This will cause system hang immediately when run capture because
the clock was not prepared(playback does not hang because the clock was
prepared already by get_mclk before), a warning message in clock framework
may cause a deadlock to reclaim clock lock (see: pl011_console_write).

Here we prepare clock first in hw_param, then enable it in trigger
function to guarantee the balance.
