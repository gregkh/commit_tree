staging: comedi: das08: Remove forward function declarations.

Moved some functions to avoid forward declarations.  Moved a few other
bits at the same time to keep EXPORT_SYMBOL{,_GPL}() close to the symbol
being exported, and PCI table close to the code that refers to it.

Changed whitespace in das08_board[] and das08_cs_board[] initializers.
