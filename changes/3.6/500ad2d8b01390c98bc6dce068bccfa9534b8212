perf/hwpb: Invoke __perf_event_disable() if interrupts are already disabled

While debugging a warning message on PowerPC while using hardware
breakpoints, it was discovered that when perf_event_disable is invoked
through hw_breakpoint_handler function with interrupts disabled, a
subsequent IPI in the code path would trigger a WARN_ON_ONCE message in
smp_call_function_single function.

This patch calls __perf_event_disable() when interrupts are already
disabled, instead of perf_event_disable().
