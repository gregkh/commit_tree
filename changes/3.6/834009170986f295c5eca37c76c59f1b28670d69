[libata] acpi: call ata_acpi_gtm during ata port init time

Commit 30dcf76acc695cbd2fa919e294670fe9552e16e7 mistakenly dropped
the code to get an initial gtm for the IDE channel. This caused the
following problem for Sergei:

Fix this by adding the call back in ata_acpi_bind_host, and due to
this, the ata_ap_acpi_handle is modified accordingly.
