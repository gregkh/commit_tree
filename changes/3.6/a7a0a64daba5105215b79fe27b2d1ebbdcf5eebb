ALSA: hda - Always call standard unsolicited event for Realtek codecs

With the model parsers out of the way, we have no custom unsol
events to worry about, we can therefore simplify the code.

In addition, this fixes a bug on the ASUS TC710, which has only
a headphone jack and a mic jack, but no internal mic or speakers.
Therefore the unsol_event pointer was not set, and as a result,
the jack kcontrols were not correctly updated.
