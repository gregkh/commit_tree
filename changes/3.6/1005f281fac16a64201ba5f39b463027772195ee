MIPS: Netlogic: remove cpu_has_dc_aliases define for XLP

On XLP, the dcache size depends on the number of enabled threads in
core. There are no dcache aliases if the pagesize is large enough or
if enough threads are enabled in the core.

Remove the #define for cpu_has_dc_aliases and leave it to be computed
at runtime.
