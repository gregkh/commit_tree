rbd: preserve snapc->seq in rbd_header_set_snap()

In rbd_header_set_snap(), there is logic to make the snap context's
seq field get set to a particular snapshot id, or 0 if there is no
snapshot for the rbd image.

This seems to be an artifact of how the current snapshot id for an
rbd_dev was recorded before the rbd_dev->snap_id field began to be
used for that purpose.

There's no need to update the value of snapc->seq here any more, so
stop doing it.  Tidy up a few local variables in that function
while we're at it.
