i2c: Convert i2c-octeon.c to use device tree.

There are three parts to this:

1) Remove the definitions of OCTEON_IRQ_TWSI and OCTEON_IRQ_TWSI2.
   The interrupts are specified by the device tree and these hard
   coded irq numbers block the used of the irq lines by the irq_domain
   code.

2) Remove platform device setup code from octeon-platform.c, it is
   now unused.

3) Convert i2c-octeon.c to use device tree.  Part of this includes
   using the devm_* functions instead of the raw counterparts, thus
   simplifying error handling.  No functionality is changed.
