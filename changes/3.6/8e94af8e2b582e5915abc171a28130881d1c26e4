rbd: encapsulate header validity test

If an rbd image header is read and it doesn't begin with the
expected magic information, a warning is displayed.  This is
a fairly simple test, but it could be extended at some point.
Fix the comparison so it actually looks at the "text" field
rather than the front of the structure.

In any case, encapsulate the validity test in its own function.
