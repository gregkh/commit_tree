ath6kl: Include match ssid list in scheduled scan

Scheduled scan implementation was only taking probed list into
consideration. The matched list was dropped. This would cause
FW not to report the AP as the list never had that AP's SSID
populated. This was causing long connection time when supplicant
would just issue a wild card SSID in probed list. As a part of
this implementation, ath6kl driver would create a complete list
by taking both probed and matched list and pass it to FW. FW would
probe for the SSID that it needs to and would match against the
relevant SSIDS that is been configured.

kvalo: whitespace changes, less indentation in the for loop, use ++
