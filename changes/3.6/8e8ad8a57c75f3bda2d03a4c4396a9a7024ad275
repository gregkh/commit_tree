ext4: Convert to new freezing mechanism

We remove most of frozen checks since upper layer takes care of blocking all
writes. We have to handle protection in ext4_page_mkwrite() in a special way
because we cannot use generic block_page_mkwrite(). Also we add a freeze
protection to ext4_evict_inode() so that iput() of unlinked inode cannot modify
a frozen filesystem (we cannot easily instrument ext4_journal_start() /
ext4_journal_stop() with freeze protection because we are missing the
superblock pointer in ext4_journal_stop() in nojournal mode).
