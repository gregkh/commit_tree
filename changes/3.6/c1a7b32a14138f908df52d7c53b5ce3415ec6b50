KVM: Avoid wasting pages for small lpage_info arrays

lpage_info is created for each large level even when the memory slot is
not for RAM.  This means that when we add one slot for a PCI device, we
end up allocating at least KVM_NR_PAGE_SIZES - 1 pages by vmalloc().

To make things worse, there is an increasing number of devices which
would result in more pages being wasted this way.

This patch mitigates this problem by using kvm_kvzalloc().
