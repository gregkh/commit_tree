drbd: fix drbd wire compatibility for empty flushes

DRBD has a concept of request epochs or reorder-domains,
which are separated on the wire by P_BARRIER packets.

Older DRBD is not able to handle zero-sized requests at all,
so we need to map empty flushes to these drbd barriers.

These are the equivalent of empty flushes, and
by default trigger flushes on the receiving side anyways
(unless not supported or explicitly disabled),
so there is no need to handle this differently in newer drbd either.
