net_sched: gred: fix qave reporting via netlink

q->vars.qavg is a Wlog scaled value, but q->backlog is not. In order
to pass q->vars.qavg as the backlog value, we need to un-scale it.
Additionally, the qave value returned via netlink should not be Wlog
scaled, so we need to un-scale the result of red_calc_qavg().

This caused artificially high values for "Average Queue" to be shown
by 'tc -s -d qdisc', but did not affect the actual operation of GRED.
