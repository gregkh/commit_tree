USB: EHCI: don't refcount iso_stream structures

This patch (as1580) makes ehci_iso_stream structures behave more like
QHs, in that they will remain allocated until their isochronous
endpoint is disabled.  This will come in useful in the future, when
periodic bandwidth gets allocated as an altsetting is installed rather
than on-the-fly.

For now, the change to the ehci_iso_stream lifetimes means that each
structure is always deallocated at exactly one spot in
ehci_endpoint_disable() and never used again.  As a result, it is no
longer necessary to use reference counting on these things, and the
patch removes it.
