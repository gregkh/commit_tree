Btrfs: don't return true in releasepage unless we actually freed the eb

I noticed while looking at an extent_buffer race that we will
unconditionally return 1 if we get down to release_extent_buffer after
clearing the tree ref.  However we can easily race in here and get a ref on
the eb and not actually free the eb.  So make release_extent_buffer return 1
if it free'd the eb and 0 if not so we can be a little kinder to the vm.
