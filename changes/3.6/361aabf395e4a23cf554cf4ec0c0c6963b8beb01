USB: EHCI: don't lose events during a scan

This patch (as1584) fixes a minor bug that has been present in
ehci-hcd since the beginning.

Scanning the schedules for URB completions is single-threaded.  If a
completion interrupt occurs while an URB is being given back, the
interrupt handler realizes that a scan is in progress on another CPU
and avoids starting a new one.

This means that completion events can be lost.  If an URB completes
after it has been scanned but while a scan is still in progress, the
driver won't notice and won't rescan the completed URB.

The patch fixes the problem by adding a new flag to indicate that
another scan is needed after the current scan is done.  The flag gets
set whenever a completion interrupt occurs while a scan is in
progress.  The rescan will see the completion, thus preventing it from
getting lost.
