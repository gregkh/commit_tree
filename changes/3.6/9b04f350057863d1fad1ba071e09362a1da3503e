ipv4: properly update pmtu

Sylvain Munault reported following info :

 - TCP connection get "stuck" with data in send queue when doing
   "large" transfers ( like typing 'ps ax' on a ssh connection )
 - Only happens on path where the PMTU is lower than the MTU of
   the interface
 - Is not present right after boot, it only appears 10-20min after
   boot or so. (and that's inside the _same_ TCP connection, it works
   fine at first and then in the same ssh session, it'll get stuck)
 - Definitely seems related to fragments somehow since I see a router
   sending ICMP message saying fragmentation is needed.
 - Exact same setup works fine with kernel 3.5.1

Problem happens when the 10 minutes (ip_rt_mtu_expires) expiration
period is over.

ip_rt_update_pmtu() calls dst_set_expires() to rearm a new expiration,
but dst_set_expires() does nothing because dst.expires is already set.

It seems we want to set the expires field to a new value, regardless
of prior one.
