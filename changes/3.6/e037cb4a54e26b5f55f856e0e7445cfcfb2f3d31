ALSA : hda - bug fix on checking the supported power states of a codec

The return value of snd_hda_param_read() is -1 for an error, otherwise
it's the supported power states of a codec.

The supported power states is a 32-bit value. Bit 31 will be set to 1
if the codec supports EPSS, thus making "sup" negative. And the bit
28:5 is reserved as "0".
So a negative value other than -1 shall be further checked.

Please refer to High-Definition spec 7.3.4.12 "Supported Power
States", thanks!
