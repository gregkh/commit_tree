cpusets, hotplug: Restructure functions that are invoked during hotplug

Separate out the cpuset related handling for CPU/Memory online/offline.
This also helps us exploit the most obvious and basic level of optimization
that any notification mechanism (CPU/Mem online/offline) has to offer us:
"We *know* why we have been invoked. So stop pretending that we are lost,
and do only the necessary amount of processing!".

And while at it, rename scan_for_empty_cpusets() to
scan_cpusets_upon_hotplug(), which is more appropriate considering how
it is restructured.
