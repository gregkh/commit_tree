ASoC: tegra: fix maxburst settings in dmaengine code

The I2S controllers are programmed with an "attention" level of 4 DWORDs.
This must match the configuration passed to the DMA driver, so that when
they burst in data, they don't overflow the available FIFO space. Also,
the burst size is relevant to the destination for playback, and source
for capture, not vice-versa as originally written.
