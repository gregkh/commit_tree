[media] em28xx: Improve support for the Terratec Cinergy HTC Stick HD

The windows driver used different values for the GPIOs and analog
decoder configuration. The values from the windows driver are now
used.
It also seems that the windows driver has LNA always disabled.
Thus we are doing the same (using the same flags as on windows).

I (only) tested with DVB-T and it worked quite well.
