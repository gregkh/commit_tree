dma: sh: provide a migration path for slave drivers to stop using .private

This patch extends the sh dmaengine driver to support the preferred channel
selection and configuration method, instead of using the "private" field
from struct dma_chan. We add a standard filter function to be used by
slave drivers instead of implementing their own ones, and add support for
the DMA_SLAVE_CONFIG control operation, which must accompany the new
channel selection method. We still support the legacy .private channel
allocation method to cater for a smooth driver migration.
