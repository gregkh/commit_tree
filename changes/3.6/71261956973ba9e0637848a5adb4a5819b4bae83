pkt_sched: fix virtual-start-time update in QFQ

If the old timestamps of a class, say cl, are stale when the class
becomes active, then QFQ may assign to cl a much higher start time
than the maximum value allowed. This may happen when QFQ assigns to
the start time of cl the finish time of a group whose classes are
characterized by a higher value of the ratio
max_class_pkt/weight_of_the_class with respect to that of
cl. Inserting a class with a too high start time into the bucket list
corrupts the data structure and may eventually lead to crashes.
This patch limits the maximum start time assigned to a class.
