alpha: fix fpu.h usage in userspace

After commit ec2212088c42 ("Disintegrate asm/system.h for Alpha"), the
fpu.h header which we install for userland started depending on
special_insns.h which is not installed.

However, fpu.h only uses that for __KERNEL__ code, so protect the
inclusion the same way to avoid build breakage in glibc:

  /usr/include/asm/fpu.h:4:31: fatal error: asm/special_insns.h: No such file or directory
