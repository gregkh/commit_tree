HID: uhid: introduce user-space I/O driver support for HID

This adds a dummy driver that will support user-space I/O drivers for the
HID subsystem. This allows to write transport-level drivers like USB-HID
and Bluetooth-HID in user-space.

Low-Energy Bluetooth needs this to feed HID data that is parsed in
user-space back into the kernel.
