ARM: SAMSUNG: Modify s3c64xx_spi{0|1|2}_set_platdata function

With the spi controller hardware configuration moved into the driver data, there
are no more default hardware configuration data that is passed through platform
data. Accordingly, the s3c64xx_spi{0|1|2}_set_platdata functions are adapted to
these changes.
