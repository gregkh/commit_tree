x86/apic/x2apic: Limit the vector reservation to the user specified mask

For the x2apic cluster mode, vector for an interrupt is
currently reserved on all the cpu's that are part of the x2apic
cluster. But the interrupts will be routed only to the cluster
(derived from the first cpu in the mask) members specified in
the mask. So there is no need to reserve the vector in the
unused cluster members.

Modify __assign_irq_vector() to reserve the vectors based on the
user specified irq destination mask. If the new mask is a proper
subset of the currently used mask, cleanup the vector allocation
on the unused cpu members.

Also, allow the apic driver to tune the vector domain based on
the affinity mask (which in most cases is the user-specified
mask).
