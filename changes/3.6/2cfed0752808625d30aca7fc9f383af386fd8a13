mm: fix free page check in zone_watermark_ok()

__zone_watermark_ok currently compares free_pages which is a signed type
with z->lowmem_reserve[classzone_idx] which is unsigned which might lead
to sign overflow if free_pages doesn't satisfy the given order (or it came
as negative already) and then we rely on the following order loop to fix
it (which doesn't work for order-0).  Let's fix the type conversion and do
not rely on the given value of free_pages or follow up fixups.

This patch fixes it because "memory-hotplug: fix kswapd looping forever
problem" depends on this.

As benefit of this patch, it doesn't rely on the loop to exit
__zone_watermark_ok in case of high order check and make the first test
effective.(ie, if (free_pages <= min + lowmem_reserve))

Aaditya reported this problem when he test my hotplug patch.
