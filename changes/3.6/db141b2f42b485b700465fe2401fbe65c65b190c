drbd: fix max_bio_size to be unsigned

We capped our max_bio_size respectively max_hw_sectors with
min_t(int, lower level limit, our limit);
unfortunately, some drivers, e.g. the kvm virtio block driver, initialize their
limits to "-1U", and that is of course a smaller "int" value than our limit.

Impact: we started to request 16 MB resync requests,
which lead to protocol error and a reconnect loop.

Fix all relevant constants and parameters to be unsigned int.
