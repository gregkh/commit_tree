staging: comedi: dmm32at: remove unneeded boardinfo variables

Like most of the comedi drivers, this one appears to have been started
based on the skel driver. Cut-and-paste from that driver has resulted
in an unnecessarily complex boardinfo struct.

Remove everything from the boardinfo struct, except the 'name', and
just use the open coded values in the attach function.
