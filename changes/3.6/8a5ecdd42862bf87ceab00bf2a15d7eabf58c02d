block: add q->nr_rqs[] and move q->rq.elvpriv to q->nr_rqs_elvpriv

Add q->nr_rqs[] which currently behaves the same as q->rq.count[] and
move q->rq.elvpriv to q->nr_rqs_elvpriv.  blk_drain_queue() is updated
to use q->nr_rqs[] instead of q->rq.count[].

These counters separates queue-wide request statistics from the
request list and allow implementation of per-queue request allocation.

While at it, properly indent fields of struct request_list.
