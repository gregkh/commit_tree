llc2: Fix silent failure of llc_station_init()

llc_station_init() creates and processes an event skb with no effect
other than to change the state from DOWN to UP.  Allocation failure is
reported, but then ignored by its caller, llc2_init().  Remove this
possibility by simply initialising the state as UP.
