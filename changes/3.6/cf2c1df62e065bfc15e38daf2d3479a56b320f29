bnx2x: Return only online tests for MF

1. In multi-function device, show only the online tests in self-test results as
   only these test are performed (offline tests cannot be performed as they may
   corrupt the traffic of other functions on the same physical port). Note that
   multi-function mode cannot change while the driver is up.
2. Check result code in NIC load and act accordingly.
