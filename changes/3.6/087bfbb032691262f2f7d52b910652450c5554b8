perf/x86: Add generic Intel uncore PMU support

This patch adds the generic Intel uncore PMU support, including helper
functions that add/delete uncore events, a hrtimer that periodically
polls the counters to avoid overflow and code that places all events
for a particular socket onto a single cpu.

The code design is based on the structure of Sandy Bridge-EP's uncore
subsystem, which consists of a variety of components, each component
contains one or more "boxes".

(Tooling support follows in the next patches.)
