[media] V4L: Remove "_ACTIVE" from the selection target name definitions

This patch drops the _ACTIVE part from the selection target names
as a prerequisite to unify the selection target names across the subdev
and regular video node API.

The meaning of V4L2_SEL_TGT_*_ACTIVE and V4L2_SUBDEV_SEL_TGT_*_ACTUAL
selection targets is logically the same. Different names add to confusion
where both APIs are used in a single driver or an application. For some
system configurations different names may lead to interoperability issues.

For backwards compatibility V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_ACTIVE and
V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE_ACTIVE are defined as aliases to V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP
and V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE. These aliases will be removed after deprecation
period, according to Documentation/feature-removal-schedule.txt.
