[PARISC] fix personality flag check in copy_thread()

Directly comparing task_struct->personality against PER_* is not fully
correct, as it doesn't take flags potentially stored in top three bytes
into account.

Analogically, directly forcefully setting personality to PER_LINUX32 or
PER_LINUX discards any flags stored in the top three bytes.
