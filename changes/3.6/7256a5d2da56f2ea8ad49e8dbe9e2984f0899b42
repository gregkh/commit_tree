powerpc: Fix personality handling in ppc64_personality()

Directly comparing current->personality against PER_LINUX32 doesn't work
in cases when any of the personality flags stored in the top three bytes
are used.

Directly forcefully setting personality to PER_LINUX32 or PER_LINUX
discards any flags stored in the top three bytes

Use personality() macro to compare only PER_MASK bytes and make sure that
we are setting only the bits that should be set, instead of overwriting
the whole value.
