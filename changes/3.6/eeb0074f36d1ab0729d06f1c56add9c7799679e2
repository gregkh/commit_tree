rpmsg: fix dma_free_coherent dev parameter

dma_alloc/free_coherent APIs requires the platform specific remoteproc
device as the device parameter. We are passing vdev->dev.parent to the
dma_free_coherent function which is the generic rproc device and it is
wrong, it has to be vdev->dev.parent->parent instead, same as when we
call dma_alloc_coherent function.
