net: netprio_cgroup: rework update socket logic

Instead of updating the sk_cgrp_prioidx struct field on every send
this only updates the field when a task is moved via cgroup
infrastructure.

This allows sockets that may be used by a kernel worker thread
to be managed. For example in the iscsi case today a user can
put iscsid in a netprio cgroup and control traffic will be sent
with the correct sk_cgrp_prioidx value set but as soon as data
is sent the kernel worker thread isssues a send and sk_cgrp_prioidx
is updated with the kernel worker threads value which is the
default case.

It seems more correct to only update the field when the user
explicitly sets it via control group infrastructure. This allows
the users to manage sockets that may be used with other threads.
