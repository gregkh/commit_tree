ALSA: hda - add support for HD-Audio CODECes of VIA HDMI GFX Cards

This is patch supporting the CODECes of HD-Audio function of VIA GFX
cards which support HDMI.
For CODECes 0x9f80/0x9f81, which belong to VX900, since the hardware
is not fully compliant to HD-Audio 1.3, simple_i*() is adopted
temporarily.
