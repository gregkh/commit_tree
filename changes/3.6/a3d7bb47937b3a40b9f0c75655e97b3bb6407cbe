uprobes: Change read_opcode() to use FOLL_FORCE

set_orig_insn()->read_opcode() should not fail if the probed
task did mprotect() after uprobe_register(), change it to use
FOLL_FORCE. Without FOLL_WRITE this doesn't have any "side"
effect but allows to read the !VM_READ memory.

There is another reason for this change, we are going to use
is_swbp_at_addr() from handle_swbp() which can race with another
thread doing mprotect().
