Revert "i2c: tegra: convert normal suspend/resume to *_noirq"

This reverts commit 7c86d44cda2e715bc95f525fd0eac4bd6a66998e.
Stephen says:

IIRC, I proposed it before solely to solve some suspend/resume ordering
issues, and Colin Cross NAKd it. These days, deferred probe should make
this change unnecessary.
