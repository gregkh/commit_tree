dm thin: split discards on block boundary

This patch sets the variable "ti->split_discard_requests" for the dm thin
target so that device mapper core splits discard requests on a block
boundary.

Consequently, a discard request that spans multiple blocks is never sent
to dm-thin. The patch also removes some code in process_discard that
deals with discards that span multiple blocks.
