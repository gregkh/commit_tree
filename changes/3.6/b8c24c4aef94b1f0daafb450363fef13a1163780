slob: Define page struct fields used in mm_types.h

Define the fields used by slob in mm_types.h and use struct page instead
of struct slob_page in slob. This cleans up numerous of typecasts in slob.c and
makes readers aware of slob's use of page struct fields.

[Also cleans up some bitrot in slob.c. The page struct field layout
in slob.c is an old layout and does not match the one in mm_types.h]
