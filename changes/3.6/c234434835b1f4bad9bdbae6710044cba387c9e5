staging: zsmalloc: zsmalloc: use unsigned long instead of void *

We should use unsigned long as handle instead of void * to avoid any
confusion. Without this, users may just treat zs_malloc return value as
a pointer and try to deference it.

This patch passed compile test(zram, zcache and ramster) and zram is
tested on qemu.
