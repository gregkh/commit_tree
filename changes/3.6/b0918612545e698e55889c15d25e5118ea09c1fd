ktest: Add CONFIG_BISECT_CHECK option

The config-bisect can take a bad config and bisect it down to find out
what config actually breaks the config. But as all tests will apply a
minconfig (defined by a user) to apply before booting, it is possible
that the minconfig could actually make the bad config work (minconfigs
can disable configs). The end result is that the config bisect test will
not find a config that breaks. This can be rather frustrating to the
user.

The CONFIG_BISECT_CHECK option, when set to 1, will make sure that the
bad config (with the minconfig applied) still fails before trying to
bisect.

And yes, I did get burned by this.
