drm/i915: Apply post-sync write for pipe control invalidates

When invalidating the TLBs it is documentated as requiring a post-sync
write. Failure to do so seems to result in a GPU hang.

Exposure to this hang on IVB seems to be a result of removing the extra
stalls required for SNB pipecontrol workarounds:

    drm/i915: Only apply the SNB pipe control w/a to gen6

Note: Manually switch the pipe_control cmd to 4 dwords to avoid a
(silent) functional conflict with -next. This way will get a loud (but
conflict with next (since the scratch_addr has been deleted there).
