netfilter: ctnetlink: fix compilation with NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS=n

This patch fixes compilation with NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS=n and
NETFILTER_NETLINK_QUEUE_CT=y.

I'm leaving all those static inline functions that calculate the size
of the event message out of the ifdef area of NF_CONNTRACK_EVENTS since
they will not be included by gcc in case they are unused.
