mm, slab: lock the correct nodelist after reenabling irqs

cache_grow() can reenable irqs so the cpu (and node) can change, so ensure
that we take list_lock on the correct nodelist.

This fixes an issue with commit 072bb0aa5e06 ("mm: sl[au]b: add
knowledge of PFMEMALLOC reserve pages") where list_lock for the wrong
node was taken after growing the cache.
