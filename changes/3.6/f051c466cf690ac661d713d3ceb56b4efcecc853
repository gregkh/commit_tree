pwm: Allow chips to support multiple PWMs

Many PWM controllers provide access to more than a single PWM output and
may even share some resource among them. Allowing a PWM chip to provide
multiple PWM devices enables better sharing of those resources. As a
side-effect this change allows easy integration with the device tree
where a given PWM can be looked up based on the PWM chip's phandle and a
corresponding index.

This commit modifies the PWM core to support multiple PWMs per struct
pwm_chip. It achieves this in a similar way to how gpiolib works, by
allowing PWM ranges to be requested dynamically (pwm_chip.base == -1) or
starting at a given offset (pwm_chip.base >= 0). A chip specifies how
many PWMs it controls using the npwm member. Each of the functions in
the pwm_ops structure gets an additional argument that specified the PWM
number (it can be converted to a per-chip index by subtracting the
chip's base).

The total maximum number of PWM devices is currently fixed to 1024 while
the data is actually stored in a radix tree, thus saving resources if
not all of them are used.
