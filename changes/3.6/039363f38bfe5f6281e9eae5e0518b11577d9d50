mm, sl[aou]b: Extract common code for kmem_cache_create()

Kmem_cache_create() does a variety of sanity checks but those
vary depending on the allocator. Use the strictest tests and put them into
a slab_common file. Make the tests conditional on CONFIG_DEBUG_VM.

This patch has the effect of adding sanity checks for SLUB and SLOB
under CONFIG_DEBUG_VM and removes the checks in SLAB for !CONFIG_DEBUG_VM.
