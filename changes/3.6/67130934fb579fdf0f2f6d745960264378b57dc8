libceph: embed ceph connection structure in mon_client

A monitor client has a pointer to a ceph connection structure in it.
This is the only one of the three ceph client types that do it this
way; the OSD and MDS clients embed the connection into their main
structures.  There is always exactly one ceph connection for a
monitor client, so there is no need to allocate it separate from the
monitor client structure.

So switch the ceph_mon_client structure to embed its
ceph_connection structure.
