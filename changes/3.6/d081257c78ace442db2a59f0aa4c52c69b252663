ath9k_hw: remove debugging masks from AR_MCI_INTERRUPT_RX_MSG_DEFAULT

Remove the CONT_* and LNA_* messages from
AR_MCI_INTERRUPT_RX_MSG_DEFAULT. Those MCI rx messages only
meant for debugging purpose. Including them in default rx_msg
series could raise huge amount of MCI interrupts when BT traffic
is going on. And also it increases power consumption when WLAN
is scanning.
