cpuidle: move field disable from per-driver to per-cpu

Andrew J.Schorr raises a question.  When he changes the disable setting on
a single CPU, it affects all the other CPUs.  Basically, currently, the
disable field is per-driver instead of per-cpu.  All the C states of the
same driver are shared by all CPU in the same machine.

The patch changes the `disable' field to per-cpu, so we could set this
separately for each cpu.
