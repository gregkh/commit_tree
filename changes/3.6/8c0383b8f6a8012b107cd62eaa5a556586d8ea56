ARM: exynos_defconfig: enable more platforms in defconfig

This enables the new EXYNOS5 platforms in the defconfig, and enables DT
support on EXYNOS4.

Other options enabled: USB host, EXT3/4, regulators and tps65090,
networking and a few of the common usb ethernet adapters as well as the
smsc911x controller used on some boards.

I enabled EFI_PARTITION, since it's used on some filesystem images I'm
using. I didn't see a need to keep Solaris and BSD partition format
still enabled.

Finally, framebuffer console, logo and fonts were enabled.

Note that enabling some of these options introduces build coverage
previously missing, thus introducing a few build errors and warnings
for which fixes have been sent out already.
