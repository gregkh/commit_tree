     regression: disable timer peek-ahead for 2.6.28

     It's showing up as regressions; disabling it very likely just papers
     over an underlying issue, but time is running out for 2.6.28, lets get
     back to this for 2.6.29

 Many years has passed since 2008, so it seems ok to remove whole `#if 0' block.
