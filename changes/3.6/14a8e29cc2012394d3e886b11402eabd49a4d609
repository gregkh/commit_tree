crypto: caam - consolidate memory barriers from job ring en/dequeue

Memory barriers are implied by the i/o register write implementation
(at least on Power).  So we can remove the redundant wmb() in
caam_jr_enqueue, and, in dequeue(), hoist the h/w done notification
write up to before we need to increment the head of the ring, and
save an smp_mb.
