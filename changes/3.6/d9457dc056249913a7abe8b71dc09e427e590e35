xfs: Convert to new freezing code

Generic code now blocks all writers from standard write paths. So we add
blocking of all writers coming from ioctl (we get a protection of ioctl against
racing remount read-only as a bonus) and convert xfs_file_aio_write() to a
non-racy freeze protection. We also keep freeze protection on transaction
start to block internal filesystem writes such as removal of preallocated
blocks.
