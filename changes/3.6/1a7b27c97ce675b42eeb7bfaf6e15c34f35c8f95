ipv4: Use newinet->inet_opt in inet_csk_route_child_sock()

Since 0e734419923bd ("ipv4: Use inet_csk_route_child_sock() in DCCP and
TCP."), inet_csk_route_child_sock() is called instead of
inet_csk_route_req().

However, after creating the child-sock in tcp/dccp_v4_syn_recv_sock(),
ireq->opt is set to NULL, before calling inet_csk_route_child_sock().
Thus, inside inet_csk_route_child_sock() opt is always NULL and the
SRR-options are not respected anymore.
Packets sent by the server won't have the correct destination-IP.

This patch fixes it by accessing newinet->inet_opt instead of ireq->opt
inside inet_csk_route_child_sock().
