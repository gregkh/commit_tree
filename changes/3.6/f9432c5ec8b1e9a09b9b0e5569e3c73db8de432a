Bluetooth: RFCOMM - Fix info leak in ioctl(RFCOMMGETDEVLIST)

The RFCOMM code fails to initialize the two padding bytes of struct
rfcomm_dev_list_req inserted for alignment before copying it to
userland. Additionally there are two padding bytes in each instance of
struct rfcomm_dev_info. The ioctl() that for disclosures two bytes plus
dev_num times two bytes uninitialized kernel heap memory.

Allocate the memory using kzalloc() to fix this issue.
