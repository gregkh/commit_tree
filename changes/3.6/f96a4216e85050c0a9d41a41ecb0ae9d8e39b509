USB: echi-dbgp: increase the controller wait time to come out of halt.

The default 10 microsecond delay for the controller to come out of
halt in dbgp_ehci_startup is too short, so increase it to 1 millisecond.

This is based on emperical testing on various USB debug ports on
modern machines such as a Lenovo X220i and an Ivybridge development
platform that needed to wait ~450-950 microseconds.
