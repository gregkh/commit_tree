crypto: caam - support external seq in/out lengths

functions for external storage of seq in/out lengths,
i.e., for 32-bit lengths.

These type-dependent functions automatically determine whether to
store the length internally (embedded in the command header word) or
externally (after the address pointer), based on size of the type
given.
