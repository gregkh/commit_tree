ASoC: wm9712: Fix microphone source selection

Currently the microphone input source is not selectable as while there is
a DAPM widget it's not connected to anything so it won't be properly
instantiated. Add something more correct for the input structure to get
things going, even though it's not hooked into the rest of the routing
map and so won't actually achieve anything except allowing the relevant
register bits to be written.
