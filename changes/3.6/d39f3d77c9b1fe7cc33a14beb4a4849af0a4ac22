kmsg - export "continuation record" flag to /dev/kmsg

In some cases we are forced to store individual records for a continuation
line print.

Export a flag to allow the external re-construction of the line. The flag
allows us to apply a similar logic externally which is used internally when
the console, /proc/kmsg or the syslog() output is printed.
