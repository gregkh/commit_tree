mmc: dw_mmc: Add check for IDMAC configuration

In the current dwmmc driver there is support for selecting IDMAC from
the menu config option. If the support for IDMAC is enabled in the menu
config and the hardware configuration register's DMA_INTERFACE field is
0, the driver will still try to do the DMA initialization.

The dw_mci_idmac_init function currently implemented returns only success
indicating that the DMA initialization is always successful. This patch
adds a check for existence of the DMA IP to allow the DMA initialization.
