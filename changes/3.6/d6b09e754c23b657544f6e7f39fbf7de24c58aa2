fault-injection: fix failcmd.sh warning

"fault-injection: add tool to run command with failslab or
fail_page_alloc" added tools/testing/fault-injection/failcmd.sh to make it
easier to inject slab/page allocation failures by fault injection.

failcmd.sh prints the following warning when running with arguments
for command.

	# ./failcmd.sh echo aaa
	failcmd.sh: line 209: [: echo: binary operator expected
	aaa

This warning is caused by an improper check whether at least one
parameter is left after parsing command options.

Fix it by testing the length of $1 instead of $@
