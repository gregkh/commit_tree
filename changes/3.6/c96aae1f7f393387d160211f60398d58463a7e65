xen/setup: Fix one-off error when adding for-balloon PFNs to the P2M.

When we are finished with return PFNs to the hypervisor, then
populate it back, and also mark the E820 MMIO and E820 gaps
as IDENTITY_FRAMEs, we then call P2M to set areas that can
be used for ballooning. We were off by one, and ended up
over-writting a P2M entry that most likely was an IDENTITY_FRAME.
For example:

1-1 mapping on 40000->40200
1-1 mapping on bc558->bc5ac
1-1 mapping on bc5b4->bc8c5
1-1 mapping on bc8c6->bcb7c
1-1 mapping on bcd00->100000
Released 614 pages of unused memory
Set 277889 page(s) to 1-1 mapping
Populating 40200-40466 pfn range: 614 pages added

=> here we set from 40466 up to bc559 P2M tree to be
INVALID_P2M_ENTRY. We should have done it up to bc558.

The end result is that if anybody is trying to construct
a PTE for PFN bc558 they end up with ~PAGE_PRESENT.
