i2c: i2c-bfin-twi: Illegal i2c bus lock upon certain transfer scenarios.

For transfer counts > 255 bytes i2c-bfin-twi sets the data
transfer counter DCNT to 0xFF indicating unlimited transfers.
It then uses a flag iface->manual_stop to manually issue the STOP
condition, once the required amount of bytes are received.

We found that on I2C receive operation issuing the STOP condition
together with a FULL RCV FIFO (2bytes) will cause SDA and SCL be
constantly driven low.

Temporary workaround until further investigation:
Discard the RCV FIFO before issuing the STOP condition.
