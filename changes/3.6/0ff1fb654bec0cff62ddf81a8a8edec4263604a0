{NET, IB}/mlx4: Add device managed flow steering firmware API

The driver is modified to support three operation modes.

If supported by firmware use the device managed flow steering
API, that which we call device managed steering mode. Else, if
the firmware supports the B0 steering mode use it, and finally,
if none of the above, use the A0 steering mode.

When the steering mode is device managed, the code is modified
such that L2 based rules set by the mlx4_en driver for Ethernet
unicast and multicast, and the IB stack multicast attach calls
done through the mlx4_ib driver are all routed to use the device
managed API.

When attaching rule using device managed flow steering API,
the firmware returns a 64 bit registration id, which is to be
provided during detach.

Currently the firmware is always programmed during HCA initialization
to use standard L2 hashing. Future work should be done to allow
configuring the flow-steering hash function with common, non
proprietary means.
