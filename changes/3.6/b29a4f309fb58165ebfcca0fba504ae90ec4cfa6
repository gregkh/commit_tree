[SCSI] libfc: add exch timer debug info

Add exch timeout info to have debug log with exch timeout
value to match with retries, also add debug info
on exch timer cancel.

Added common fc_exch_timer_cancel() func and grouped this
along with fc_exch_timer_set() function, so that
added debug code is not repeated.
