USB: kaweth.c: use GFP_ATOMIC under spin_lock

The problem is that we call this with a spin lock held.  The call tree
is:
	kaweth_start_xmit() holds kaweth->device_lock.
	-> kaweth_async_set_rx_mode()
	   -> kaweth_control()
	      -> kaweth_internal_control_msg()

The kaweth_internal_control_msg() function is only called from
kaweth_control() which used GFP_ATOMIC for its allocations.
