Change email address for Steve Glendinning

I no longer have a mailbox at smsc.com, and I've had two reports
that that email address now bounces from people trying to
contact me.  This patch updates all references to that invalid
address to one that I can be contacted on more permanently.

This patch also updates the maintainer status to reflect
the fact I'm no longer directly paid to maintain these drivers.
