perf/x86: Add Intel Westmere-EX uncore support

The Westmere-EX uncore is similar to the Nehalem-EX uncore. The
differences are:
 - Westmere-EX uncore has 10 instances of Cbox. The MSRs for Cbox8
   and Cbox9 in the Westmere-EX aren't contiguous with Cbox 0~7.
 - The fvid field in the ZDP_CTL_FVC register in the Mbox is
   different. It's 5 bits in the Nehalem-EX, 6 bits in the
   Westmere-EX.
