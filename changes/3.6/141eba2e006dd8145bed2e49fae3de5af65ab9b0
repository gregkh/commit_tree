regmap: allow busses to request formatting with specific endianness

Add a field to struct regmap_bus that allows bus drivers to request that
register addresses and values be formatted with a specific endianness.

The default endianness is unchanged from current operation: Big.

Implement native endian formatting/parsing for 16- and 32-bit values.
This will be enough to support regmap-mmio.c.
