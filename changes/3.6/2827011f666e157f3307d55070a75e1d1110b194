Bluetooth: Fix early return from l2cap_chan_del

This fixes a regression from commit
2ead70b8390d199ca04cd35311b51f5f3676079e that is present in all
kernels starting at v3.0.

When L2CAP information was moved to struct l2cap_chan, a check was
added to l2cap_chan_del to avoid certain cleanup operations when ERTM
or streaming mode had not yet been initialized.  The logic in the
check did not take in to account that chan->conf_state is set to 0 in
l2cap_chan_ready, so l2cap_chan_del failed to cancel timers and leaked
memory any time the ERTM queues or lists were not empty.

This change makes sure that l2cap_chan_del only returns early if
ERTM initialization was not performed.
