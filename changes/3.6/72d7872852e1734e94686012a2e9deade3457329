mac80211: allow low-level drivers to set netdev feature bits

Low level drivers can now set certain netdev feature bits in
netdev_features member of the ieee80211_hw struct. These will be
propagated to every netdev created from this HW.

The white-listed features currently include only ones related to HW
checksumming.
