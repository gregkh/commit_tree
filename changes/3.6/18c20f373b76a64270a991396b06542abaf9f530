x86, MCE, AMD: Print decimal thresholding values

If one sets the threshold limit, say to 25:

$ echo 25 > machinecheck0/threshold_bank4/misc0/threshold_limit

and then reads it back again, it gives

$ cat machinecheck0/threshold_bank4/misc0/threshold_limit
19

which is actually 0x19 but we don't know that.

Make all output decimal.
