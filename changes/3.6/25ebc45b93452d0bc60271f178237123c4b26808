powerpc/pseries/iommu: remove default window before attempting DDW manipulation

An upcoming release of firmware will add DDW extensions, in particular
an API to "reset" the DMA window to the original configuration (32-bit,
2GB in size). With that API available, we can safely remove the default
window, increasing the resources available to firmware for creation of
larger windows for the slot in question -- if we encounter an error, we
can use the new API to reset the state of the slot.

Further, this same release of firmware will make it a hard requirement
for OSes to release the existing window before any other windows will be
shown as available, to avoid conflicts in addressing between the two
windows.

In anticipation of these changes, always remove the default window
before we do any DDW manipulations.
