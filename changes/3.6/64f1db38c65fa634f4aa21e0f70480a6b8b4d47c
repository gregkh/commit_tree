target: remove control CDB flags

We don't need three flags to classifiy the CDB as we can check for a NULL S/G
list for a dataless command, and can infer from the absence of the data flag
that we deal with a control CDB.  Also remove the _SG_IO from the data CDB
flag as all I/O is dont on S/G lists now.
