ext4: fix long mount times on very big file systems

Commit 8aeb00ff85a: "ext4: fix overhead calculation used by
ext4_statfs()" introduced a O(n**2) calculation which makes very large
file systems take forever to mount.  Fix this with an optimization for
non-bigalloc file systems.  (For bigalloc file systems the overhead
needs to be set in the the superblock.)
