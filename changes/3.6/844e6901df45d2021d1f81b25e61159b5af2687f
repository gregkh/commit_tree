regulator: tps65217: Fix voltage boundary checking in tps65217_pmic_map_voltage

It is ok to request voltage with min_uV < tps->info[rid]->min_uV and
max_uV > tps->info[rid]->max_uV.

The equation we used in uv_to_vsel() does not allow
min_uV < tps->info[rid]->min_uV, otherwise it returns negative selector.
So we need to set min_uV = tps->info[rid]->min_uV if
min_uV < tps->info[rid]->min_uV.
