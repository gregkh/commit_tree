ARM: 7463/1: topology: Update cpu_power according to DT information

Use cpu compatibility field and clock-frequency field of DT to
estimate the capacity of each core of the system and to update
the cpu_power field accordingly.
This patch enables to put more running tasks on big cores than
on LITTLE ones. But this patch doesn't ensure that long running
tasks will run on big cores and short ones on LITTLE cores.
