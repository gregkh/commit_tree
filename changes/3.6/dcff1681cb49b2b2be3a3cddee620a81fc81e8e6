staging: comedi: adl_pci6208: remove the bogus pci devices

Remove the commented out pci device entries in the MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE
as well as the associated boardinfo, which is also commented out. Add
some whitespace to the boardinfo to improve readability.

This driver should also support the pci-6216 card which has an
additional 8 analog outputs (16 total). But the device id needs
to be determined.
