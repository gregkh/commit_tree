x86, MCE, AMD: Move shared bank to node descriptor

Well, instead of having a real bank 4 on the BSP of each node and
symlinks on the remaining cores, we push it up into the amd_northbridge
descriptor which now contains a pointer to the northbridge bank 4
because the bank is one per northbridge and, as such, belongs in the NB
descriptor anyway.

Each time we hotplug CPUs, we use the northbridge pointer to copy the
shared bank into the per-CPU array of threshold_banks pointers, or
destroy it when the last CPU on the node goes offline, or create it when
the first comes online.
