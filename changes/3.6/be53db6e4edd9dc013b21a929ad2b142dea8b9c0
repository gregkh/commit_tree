alpha: take a bunch of syscalls into osf_sys.c

New helper: current_thread_info().  Allows to do a bunch of odd syscalls
in C. While we are at it, there had never been a reason to do
osf_getpriority() in assembler.  We also get "namespace"-aware (read:
consistent with getuid(2), etc.) behaviour from getx?id() syscalls now.
