Revert "xen PVonHVM: move shared_info to MMIO before kexec"

This reverts commit 00e37bdb0113a98408de42db85be002f21dbffd3.

During shutdown of PVHVM guests with more than 2VCPUs on certain
machines we can hit the race where the replaced shared_info is not
replaced fast enough and the PV time clock retries reading the same
area over and over without any any success and is stuck in an
infinite loop.
