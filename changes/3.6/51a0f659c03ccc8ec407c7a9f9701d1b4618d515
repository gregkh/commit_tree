dm persistent data: create new dm_block_manager struct

This patch introduces a separate struct for the block_manager.
It also uses IS_ERR to check the return value of dm_bufio_client_create
instead of testing incorrectly for NULL.

Prior to this patch a struct dm_block_manager was really an alias for
a struct dm_bufio_client.  We want to add some functionality to the
block manager that will require extra fields, so this one to one
mapping is no longer valid.
