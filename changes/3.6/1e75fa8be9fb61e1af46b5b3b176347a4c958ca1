time: Condense timekeeper.xtime into xtime_sec

The timekeeper struct has a xtime_nsec, which keeps the
sub-nanosecond remainder.  This ends up being somewhat
duplicative of the timekeeper.xtime.tv_nsec value, and we
have to do extra work to keep them apart, copying the full
nsec portion out and back in over and over.

This patch simplifies some of the logic by taking the timekeeper
xtime value and splitting it into timekeeper.xtime_sec and
reuses the timekeeper.xtime_nsec for the sub-second portion
(stored in higher res shifted nanoseconds).

This simplifies some of the accumulation logic. And will
allow for more accurate timekeeping once the vsyscall code
is updated to use the shifted nanosecond remainder.
