Btrfs: don't update atime on RO subvolumes

Before the update_time inode operation was indroduced, it was
not possible to prevent updates of atime on RO subvolumes. VFS
was only able to check for RO on the mount, but did not know
anything about btrfs subvolumes.

btrfs_update_time does now check if the root is RO and skip
updating of times.
