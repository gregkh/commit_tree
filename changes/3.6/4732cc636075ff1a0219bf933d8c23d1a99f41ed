spi/s3c64xx: improve error handling

When a device tree definition os an s3c64xx SPI master is missing
a "controller-data" subnode, the newly added s3c64xx_get_slave_ctrldata
function might use uninitialized memory in place of that node,
which was correctly reported by gcc.

Without this patch, building s3c6400_defconfig results in:

drivers/spi/spi-s3c64xx.c: In function 's3c64xx_get_slave_ctrldata.isra.25':
drivers/spi/spi-s3c64xx.c:841:5: warning: 'data_np' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
