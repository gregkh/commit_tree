fs: Push mnt_want_write() outside of i_mutex

Currently, mnt_want_write() is sometimes called with i_mutex held and sometimes
without it. This isn't really a problem because mnt_want_write() is a
non-blocking operation (essentially has a trylock semantics) but when the
function starts to handle also frozen filesystems, it will get a full lock
semantics and thus proper lock ordering has to be established. So move
all mnt_want_write() calls outside of i_mutex.

One non-trivial case needing conversion is kern_path_create() /
user_path_create() which didn't include mnt_want_write() but now needs to
because it acquires i_mutex.  Because there are virtual file systems which
don't bother with freeze / remount-ro protection we actually provide both
versions of the function - one which calls mnt_want_write() and one which does
not.

[AV: scratch the previous, mnt_want_write() has been moved to kern_path_create()
by now]
