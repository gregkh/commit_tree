powerpc/85xx: Add BSC9131 RDB Support

BSC9131RDB is a Freescale reference design board for BSC9131 SoC. The
BSC9131 is integrated SoC that targets Femto base station market. It
combines Power Architecture e500v2 and DSP StarCore SC3850 core
technologies with MAPLE-B2F baseband acceleration processing elements.

The BSC9131 SoC includes the following function and features:
    . Power Architecture subsystem including a e500 processor with 256-Kbyte
    shared L2 cache
    . StarCore SC3850 DSP subsystem with a 512-Kbyte private L2 cache
    . The Multi Accelerator Platform Engine for Femto BaseStation Baseband
      Processing (MAPLE-B2F)
    . A multi-standard baseband algorithm accelerator for Channel
      Decoding/Encoding, Fourier Transforms, UMTS chip rate processing, LTE
      UP/DL Channel processing, and CRC algorithms
    . Consists of accelerators for Convolution, Filtering, Turbo Encoding,
      Turbo Decoding, Viterbi decoding, Chiprate processing, and Matrix
      Inversion operations
    . DDR3/3L memory interface with 32-bit data width without ECC and 16-bit
      with ECC, up to 400-MHz clock/800 MHz data rate
    . Dedicated security engine featuring trusted boot
    . DMA controller
    . OCNDMA with four bidirectional channels
    . Interfaces
    . Two triple-speed Gigabit Ethernet controllers featuring network
      acceleration including IEEE 1588. v2 hardware support and
      virtualization (eTSEC)
    . eTSEC 1 supports RGMII/RMII
    . eTSEC 2 supports RGMII
    . High-speed USB 2.0 host and device controller with ULPI interface
    . Enhanced secure digital (SD/MMC) host controller (eSDHC)
    . Antenna interface controller (AIC), supporting three industry standard
      JESD207/three custom ADI RF interfaces (two dual port and one single
      port) and three MAXIM's MaxPHY serial interfaces
    . ADI lanes support both full duplex FDD support and half duplex TDD
      support
    . Universal Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) interface that facilitates
      communication to SIM cards or Eurochip pre-paid phone cards
    . TDM with one TDM port
    . Two DUART, four eSPI, and two I2C controllers
    . Integrated Flash memory controller (IFC)
    . TDM with 256 channels
    . GPIO
    . Sixteen 32-bit timers

The DSP portion of the SoC consists of DSP core (SC3850) and various
accelerators pertaining to DSP operations.
