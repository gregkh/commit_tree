nbd: clear waiting_queue on shutdown

Fix a serious but uncommon bug in nbd which occurs when there is heavy
I/O going to the nbd device while, at the same time, a failure (server,
network) or manual disconnect of the nbd connection occurs.

There is a small window between the time that the nbd_thread is stopped
and the socket is shutdown where requests can continue to be queued to
nbd's internal waiting_queue.  When this happens, those requests are
never completed or freed.

The fix is to clear the waiting_queue on shutdown of the nbd device, in
the same way that the nbd request queue (queue_head) is already being
cleared.
