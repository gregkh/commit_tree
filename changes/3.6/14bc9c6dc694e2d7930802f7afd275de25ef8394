ALSA: hda - Fix panned "Beep Playback Switch"

When "Beep Playback Switch" had a different value on left and right
channels (such as muting left but not right, or vice versa), this
could result in the right channel being ignored.

This patch enables beep to be sounding from right channel only, and
also give correct result back to userspace (e g amixer).
