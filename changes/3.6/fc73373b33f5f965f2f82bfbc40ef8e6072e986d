KVM: Add x86_hyper_kvm to complete detect_hypervisor_platform check

While debugging I noticed that unlike all the other hypervisor code in the
kernel, kvm does not have an entry for x86_hyper which is used in
detect_hypervisor_platform() which results in a nice printk in the
syslog.  This is only really a stub function but it
does make kvm more consistent with the other hypervisors.
