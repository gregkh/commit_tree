target: fix use-after-free with PSCSI sense data

The pointer to the sense buffer is fetched by transport_get_sense_data,
but this is called by target_complete_ok_work long after pscsi_req_done
has freed the struct that contains it.

Pass instead the fabric's sense buffer to transport_complete,
and copy the data to it directly in transport_complete.  Setting
SCF_TRANSPORT_TASK_SENSE also becomes a duty of transport_complete.
