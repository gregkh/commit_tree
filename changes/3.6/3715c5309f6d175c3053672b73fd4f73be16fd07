lib/vsprintf.c: kptr_restrict: fix pK-error in SysRq show-all-timers(Q)

When using ALT+SysRq+Q all the pointers are replaced with "pK-error" like
this:

	[23153.208033]   .base:               pK-error

with echo h > /proc/sysrq-trigger it works:

	[23107.776363]   .base:       ffff88023e60d540

The intent behind this behavior was to return "pK-error" in cases where
the %pK format specifier was used in interrupt context, because the
CAP_SYSLOG check wouldn't be meaningful.  Clearly this should only apply
when kptr_restrict is actually enabled though.
