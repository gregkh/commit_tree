ARM: OMAP AM35xx: clock and hwmod data: fix AM35xx HSOTGUSB hwmod

Partially fix the hwmod data for the AM35xx USB OTG hwmod.  This
should resolve the following boot warning on AM35xx platforms:

omap_hwmod: am35x_otg_hs: cannot be enabled for reset (3)

While here, also fix the clkdev records, to avoid warnings about
duplicate clock aliases.

The hwmod is also connected to the wrong interconnect.  It should be
connected to the IPSS, not the L4 CORE.  But that is left for a future
fix, since it probably has a dependency on some hwmod core changes.
