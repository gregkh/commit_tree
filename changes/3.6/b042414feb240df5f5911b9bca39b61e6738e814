nfs: increase number of permitted callback connections.

By default a sunrpc service is limited to (N+3)*20 connections
where N is the number of threads.  This is 80 when N==1.
If this number is exceeded a warning is printed suggesting that
the number of threads be increased.  However with services which
run a single thread, this is impossible.

For such services there is a ->sv_maxconn setting that can be
used to forcibly increase the limit, and silence the message.
This is used by lockd.

The nfs client uses a sunrpc service to handle callbacks and
it too is single-threaded, so to avoid the useless messages,
and to allow a reasonable number of concurrent connections,
we need to set ->sv_maxconn.  1024 seems like a good number.
