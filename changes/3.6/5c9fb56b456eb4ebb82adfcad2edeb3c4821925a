ARM: S3C24XX: Convert QT2410 board file to the gpiolib API

Replace SoC specific GPIO functions with the gpiolib API. The LED
gpio is freed right after it is configured so it can be acquired
in the s3c24xx_led driver.

This change is required for converting the s3c24xx_led driver
to the gpiolib API.
