devicetree: add helper inline for retrieving a node's full name

The pattern (np ? np->full_name : "<none>") is rather common in the
kernel, but can also make for quite long lines.  This patch adds a new
inline function, of_node_full_name() so that the test for a valid node
pointer doesn't need to be open coded at all call sites.
