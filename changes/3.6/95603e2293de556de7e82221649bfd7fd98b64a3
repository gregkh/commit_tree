net-next: add dev_loopback_xmit() to avoid duplicate code

Add dev_loopback_xmit() in order to deduplicate functions
ip_dev_loopback_xmit() (in net/ipv4/ip_output.c) and
ip6_dev_loopback_xmit() (in net/ipv6/ip6_output.c).

I was about to reinvent the wheel when I noticed that
ip_dev_loopback_xmit() and ip6_dev_loopback_xmit() do exactly what I
need and are not IP-only functions, but they were not available to reuse
elsewhere.

ip6_dev_loopback_xmit() does not have line "skb_dst_force(skb);", but I
understand that this is harmless, and should be in dev_loopback_xmit().
