ceph: avoid divide by zero in __validate_layout()

If "l->stripe_unit" is zero the the mod on the next line will cause a
divide by zero bug.  This comes from the copy_from_user() in
ceph_ioctl_set_layout_policy().  Passing 0 is valid, though (it means
"do not change") so avoid the % check in that case.
