ARM: integrator: put symbolic bus names on devices

All the Integrator devices have bus names like "mb:16" which
I think means "memory base 0x16000000" which is where the
UART0 is. So let's call it "uart0" because that's what most
platforms do these days.

Change this everywhere for the integrator as we prepare for
some core clock code movement.
