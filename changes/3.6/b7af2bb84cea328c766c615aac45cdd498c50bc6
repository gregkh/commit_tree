Input: wacom - battery reporting improvements

Do not register battery device until connected to a tablet.
This prevents an empty battery icon from being shown when tablet is
connected using USB cable.

Also, call power_supply_powers() for apps that can make use of that
info.

And stop ignoring input registration failures.
