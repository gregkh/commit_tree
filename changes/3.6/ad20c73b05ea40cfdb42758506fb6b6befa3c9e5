classmate-laptop: always call input_sync() after input_report_switch()

Due to commit cdda911c34006f1089f3c87b1a1f31ab3a4722f2 evdev only
becomes readable when the buffer contains an EV_SYN/SYN_REPORT event.

So in order to read the tablet sensor data as it happens we need to
ensure that we always call input_sync() after input_report_switch()
