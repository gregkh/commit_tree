xfs: Fix overallocation in xfs_buf_allocate_memory()

Commit de1cbee which removed b_file_offset in favor of b_bn introduced a bug
causing xfs_buf_allocate_memory() to overestimate the number of necessary
pages. The problem is that xfs_buf_alloc() sets b_bn to -1 and thus effectively
every buffer is straddling a page boundary which causes
xfs_buf_allocate_memory() to allocate two pages and use vmalloc() for access
which is unnecessary.

Dave says xfs_buf_alloc() doesn't need to set b_bn to -1 anymore since the
buffer is inserted into the cache only after being fully initialized now.
So just make xfs_buf_alloc() fill in proper block number from the beginning.
