Staging: ipack/bridges/tpci200: removed check of tpci200->slots[dev->slot].dev

When ipack_device_register() is called, the variable
tpci200->slots[dev->slot].dev has not assigned a value and it gives an error
when the mezzanine driver is reading a register from the board for the match()
function, as all the I/O functions call check_slot().
