ASoC: make snd_soc_dai_link more symmetrical

Prior to this patch, the CPU side of a DAI link was specified using a
single name. Often, this was the result of calling dev_name() on the
device providing the DAI, but in the case of a CPU DAI driver that
provided multiple DAIs, it needed to mix together both the device name
and some device-relative name, in order to form a single globally unique
name.

However, the CODEC side of the DAI link was specified using separate
fields for device (name or OF node) and device-relative DAI name.

This patch allows the CPU side of a DAI link to be specified in the same
way as the CODEC side, separating concepts of device and device-relative
DAI name.

I believe this will be important in multi-codec and/or dynamic PCM
scenarios, where a single CPU driver provides multiple DAIs, while also
booting using device tree, with accompanying desire not to hard-code the
CPU side device's name into the original .cpu_dai_name field.

Ideally, both the CPU DAI and CODEC DAI loops in soc_bind_dai_link()
would now be identical. However, two things prevent that at present:

1) The need to save rtd->codec for the CODEC side, which means we have
to search for the CODEC explicitly, and not just the CODEC side DAI.

2) Since we know the CODEC side DAI is part of a codec, and not just
a standalone DAI, it's slightly more efficient to convert .codec_name/
.codec_of_node into a codec first, and then compare each DAI's .codec
field, since this avoids strcmp() on each DAI's CODEC's name within
the loop.

However, the two loops are essentially semantically equivalent.
