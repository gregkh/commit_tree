ipv4: Create and use fib_compute_spec_dst() helper.

The specific destination is the host we direct unicast replies to.
Usually this is the original packet source address, but if we are
responding to a multicast or broadcast packet we have to use something
different.

Specifically we must use the source address we would use if we were to
send a packet to the unicast source of the original packet.

The routing cache precomputes this value, but we want to remove that
precomputation because it creates a hard dependency on the expensive
rpfilter source address validation which we'd like to make cheaper.

There are only three places where this matters:

1) ICMP replies.

2) pktinfo CMSG

3) IP options

Now there will be no real users of rt->rt_spec_dst and we can simply
remove it altogether.
