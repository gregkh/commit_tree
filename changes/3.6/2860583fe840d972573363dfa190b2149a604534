ipv4: Kill rt->fi

It's not really needed.

We only grabbed a reference to the fib_info for the sake of fib_info
local metrics.

However, fib_info objects are freed using RCU, as are therefore their
private metrics (if any).

We would have triggered a route cache flush if we eliminated a
reference to a fib_info object in the routing tables.

Therefore, any existing cached routes will first check and see that
they have been invalidated before an errant reference to these
metric values would occur.
