xen/mm: zero PTEs for non-present MFNs in the initial page table

When constructing the initial page tables, if the MFN for a usable PFN
is missing in the p2m then that frame is initially ballooned out.  In
this case, zero the PTE (as in decrease_reservation() in
drivers/xen/balloon.c).

This is obviously safe instead of having an valid PTE with an MFN of
INVALID_P2M_ENTRY (~0).
