wlcore: use psd_type indexing according to spec

In ieee80211.h the uapsd bit mask is defined such that
VO=BIT(0), VI=BIT(1), BK=BIT(2), BE=BIT(3).
The firmware uses the indexing as defined in the ieee80211
spec, meaning that VO=3, VI=2, BK=1, BE=0.

In AP mode when adding peer wlcore needs to convert
the indexing accordingly.
