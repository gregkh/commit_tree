brcmsmac: fix mismatch in number of custom regulatory rules

The driver provides the cfg80211 regulatory framework with a set of
custom rules. However, there was a mismatch in number of rules
and the actual rules provided. This resulted in setting an invalid
power level:

ieee80211 phy0: brcms_ops_config: change channel 13
ieee80211 phy0: brcms_ops_config: Error setting power_level (8758364)

Closer look in cfg80211 regulatory blurb showed following bogus rule:
cfg80211: 0 KHz - -60446948 KHz @ 875836468 KHz), (875836468 mBi, 875836468 mBm)
