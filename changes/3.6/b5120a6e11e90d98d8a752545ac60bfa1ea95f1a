IPoIB: Fix AB-BA deadlock when deleting neighbours

Lockdep points out a circular locking dependency betwwen the ipoib
device priv spinlock (priv->lock) and the neighbour table rwlock
(ntbl->rwlock).

In the normal path, ie neigbour garbage collection task, the neigh
table rwlock is taken first and then if the neighbour needs to be
deleted, priv->lock is taken.

However in some error paths, such as in ipoib_cm_handle_tx_wc(),
priv->lock is taken first and then ipoib_neigh_free routine is called
which in turn takes the neighbour table ntbl->rwlock.

The solution is to get rid the neigh table rwlock completely and use
only priv->lock.
