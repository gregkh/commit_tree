Btrfs: remove mnt_want_write call in btrfs_mksubvol

We got a recursive lock in mksubvol because the caller already held
a lock. I think we got into this due to a merge error. Commit a874a63
removed the mnt_want_write call from btrfs_mksubvol and added a
replacement call to mnt_want_write_file in btrfs_ioctl_snap_create_transid.
Commit e7848683 however tried to move all calls to mnt_want_write above
i_mutex. So somewhere while merging this, it got mixed up. The
solution is to remove the mnt_want_write call completely from
mksubvol.
