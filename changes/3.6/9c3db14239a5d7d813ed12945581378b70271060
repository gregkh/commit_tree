staging: comedi: Kconfig: remove redundant depends on tests

The 'depends on COMEDI_ISA_DRIVERS' for COMEDI_AMPLC_DIO200_ISA is
not needed. This option is alread in an if/endif block that will
satisy the check.

The 'depends on COMEDI' for COMEDI_NI_COMMON was missed when all
the comedi options were wrapped in an if/endif block.
