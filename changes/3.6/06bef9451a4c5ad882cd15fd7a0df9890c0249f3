UBIFS: add debugfs knob to switch to R/O mode

This patch adds another debugfs knob which switches UBIFS to R/O mode.
I needed it while trying to reproduce the 'first log node is not CS node'
bug. Without this debugfs knob you have to perform a power cut to repruduce
the bug. The knob is named 'ro_error' and all it does is it sets the
'ro_error' UBIFS flag which makes UBIFS disallow any further writes - even
write-back will fail with -EROFS. Useful for debugging.
