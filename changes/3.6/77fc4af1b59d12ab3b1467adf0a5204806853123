uprobes: Change register_for_each_vma() to take mm->mmap_sem for writing

Change register_for_each_vma() to take mm->mmap_sem for writing.
This is a bit unfortunate but hopefully not too bad, this is the
slow path anyway.

This is needed to ensure that find_active_uprobe() can not race
with uprobe_register() which adds the new bp at the same
bp_vaddr, after find_uprobe() fails and before
is_swbp_at_addr_fast() checks the memory.

IOW, this is needed to ensure that if find_active_uprobe()
returns NULL but is_swbp == true, we can safely assume that it
was the "normal" int3 and we should send SIGTRAP.

There is another reason for this change. We are going to replace
uprobes_state->count with MMF_ flags set by register/unregister
and cleared by find_active_uprobe(), and set/clear shouldn't
race with each other.
