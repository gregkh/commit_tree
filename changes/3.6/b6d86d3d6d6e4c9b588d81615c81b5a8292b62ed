linux/kernel.h: Fix DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST to support negative dividends

DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST returns a bad result for negative dividends:
	DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST(-2, 2) = 0

Most of the time this does not matter. However, in the hardware monitoring
subsystem, DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST is sometimes used on integers which can be
negative (such as temperatures).
