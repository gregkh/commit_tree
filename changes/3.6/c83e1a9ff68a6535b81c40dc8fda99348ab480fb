USB: EHCI: don't refcount QHs

This patch (as1567) removes ehci-hcd's reference counting of QH
structures.  It's not necessary to refcount these things because they
always get deallocated at exactly one spot in ehci_endpoint_disable()
(except for two special QHs, ehci->async and ehci->dummy) and are
never used again.
