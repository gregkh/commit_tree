HID: uhid: allow feeding input data into uhid devices

This adds a new event type UHID_INPUT which allows user-space to feed raw
HID reports into the HID subsystem. We copy the data into kernel memory
and directly feed it into the HID core.

There is no error handling of the events couldn't be parsed so user-space
should consider all events successfull unless read() returns an error.
