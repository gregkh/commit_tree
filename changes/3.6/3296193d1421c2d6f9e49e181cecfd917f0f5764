dt: introduce for_each_available_child_of_node, of_get_next_available_child

Macro for_each_child_of_node() makes it easy to iterate over all of the
children for a given device tree node, including those nodes that are
marked as unavailable (i.e. status = "disabled").

Introduce for_each_available_child_of_node(), which is like
for_each_child_of_node(), but it automatically skips unavailable nodes.
This also requires the introduction of helper function
of_get_next_available_child(), which returns the next available child
node.
