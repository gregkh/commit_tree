ARM: 7528/1: uaccess: annotate [__]{get,put}_user functions with might_fault()

The user access functions may generate a fault, resulting in invocation
of a handler that may sleep.

This patch annotates the accessors with might_fault() so that we print a
warning if they are invoked from atomic context and help lockdep keep
track of mmap_sem.
