Bluetooth: Refactor l2cap_send_ack

The function now encapsulates more of the logic to either immediately
send an ack if the transmit window is over 75% full, or wait for the
ack timer to expire if the transmit window is not full enough.  It is
also able to push out waiting iframes that can carry an
acknowledgement.
