fs: move path_put on failure out of ->follow_link

Currently the non-nd_set_link based versions of ->follow_link are expected
to do a path_put(&nd->path) on failure.  This calling convention is unexpected,
undocumented and doesn't match what the nd_set_link-based instances do.

Move the path_put out of the only non-nd_set_link based ->follow_link
instance into the caller.
