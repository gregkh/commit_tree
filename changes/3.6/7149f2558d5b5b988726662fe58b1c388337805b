eCryptfs: Write out all dirty pages just before releasing the lower file

Fixes a regression caused by:

821f749 eCryptfs: Revert to a writethrough cache model

That patch reverted some code (specifically, 32001d6f) that was
necessary to properly handle open() -> mmap() -> close() -> dirty pages
-> munmap(), because the lower file could be closed before the dirty
pages are written out.

Rather than reapplying 32001d6f, this approach is a better way of
ensuring that the lower file is still open in order to handle writing
out the dirty pages. It is called from ecryptfs_release(), while we have
a lock on the lower file pointer, just before the lower file gets the
final fput() and we overwrite the pointer.
