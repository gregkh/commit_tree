kdump: append newline to the last lien of vmcoreinfo note

The last line of vmcoreinfo note does not end with \n.  Parsing all the
lines in note becomes easier if all lines end with \n instead of trying to
special case the last line.

I know at least one tool, vmcore-dmesg in kexec-tools tree which made the
assumption that all lines end with \n.  I think it is a good idea to fix
it.
