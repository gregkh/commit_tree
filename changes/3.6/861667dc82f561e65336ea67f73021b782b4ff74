MIPS: Fix race condition in module relocation code.

The relocation code was essentially taken from the 2.4 modutils which
perform relocation in userspace.  In 2.6 relocation of multiple modules
may be performed in parallel by the in-kernel loader so the global
variable mips_hi16_list won't fly anymore.  Fix race by moving it into
mod_arch_specific.

[ralf@linux-mips.org: folded in Tony's followup fix.  Thanks Tony!]
