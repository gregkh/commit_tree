Staging: et131x: fix | vs & typos

These two places seem like they should be using bitwise OR instead of
bitwise AND.  The first one is a noop which is equivalent to:

	imr |= (0x0100 & 0x0004 & 0x0001);

The second is sets lcr2 to zero instead of just clearing the high bits.

	lcr2 &= (0x00F0 & 0x000F);
