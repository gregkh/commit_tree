perf/x86: Fix Intel Ivy Bridge support

This patch updates the existing Intel IvyBridge (model 58)
support with proper PEBS event constraints. It cannot reuse
the same as SandyBridge because some events (0xd3) are
specific to IvyBridge.

Also there is no UOPS_DISPATCHED.THREAD on IVB, so do not
populate the PERF_COUNT_HW_STALLED_CYCLES_BACKEND mapping.
