ixgbe: Only enable anti-spoof on VF pools

The current logic is enabling anti-spoof on all pools and then clearing
anti-spoof on just the first PF pool.  The correct approach is to only set
anti-spoof on the VF pools and to leave all of the PF pools unchecked.

This allows for items such as FCoE to use adjacent pools within the PF for
transmit and receive queues without the traffic being blocked by this
security feature.
