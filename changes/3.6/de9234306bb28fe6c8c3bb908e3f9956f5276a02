ARM: davinci: remove broken ntosd2_init_i2c

ntosd2_init_i2c walks the ntosd2_i2c_info array, which it expects to
be populated with at least one member. gcc correctly warns about
the out-of-bounds access here.

Since this can not possibly work, it's better to disable i2c
support entirely on this board.

Without this patch, building davinci_all_defconfig results in:

arch/arm/mach-davinci/board-neuros-osd2.c: In function 'davinci_ntosd2_init':
arch/arm/mach-davinci/board-neuros-osd2.c:187:20: warning: array subscript is above array bounds [-Warray-bounds]
