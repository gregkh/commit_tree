s390/vtimer: rework virtual timer interface

The current virtual timer interface is inherently per-cpu and hard to
use. The sole user of the interface is appldata which uses it to execute
a function after a specific amount of cputime has been used over all cpus.

Rework the virtual timer interface to hook into the cputime accounting.
This makes the interface independent from the CPU timer interrupts, and
makes the virtual timers global as opposed to per-cpu.
Overall the code is greatly simplified. The downside is that the accuracy
is not as good as the original implementation, but it is still good enough
for appldata.
