mfd: Add irq domain support for max8997 interrupts

Add irq domain support for max8997 interrupts. The reverse mapping method
used is linear mapping since the sub-drivers of max8997 such as regulator
and charger drivers can use the max8997 irq_domain to get the linux irq
number for max8997 interrupts. All uses of irq_base in platform data and
max8997 driver private data are removed.
