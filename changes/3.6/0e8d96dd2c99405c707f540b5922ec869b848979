exofs: readpage_strip: Add a BUG_ON to check for PageLocked(page)

readpage_strip can be called from several code paths all of which
require that the page be locked before any operations are carried
out.

Since we export the exofs_readpage callback to the VFS, add a
BUG_ON to check for PageLocked(page) to make sure that this
understanding is never compromised.
