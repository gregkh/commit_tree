KVM: VMX: Relax check on unusable segment

Some userspace (e.g. QEMU 1.1) munge the d and g bits of segment
descriptors, causing us not to recognize them as unusable segments
with emulate_invalid_guest_state=1.  Relax the check by testing for
segment not present (a non-present segment cannot be usable).
