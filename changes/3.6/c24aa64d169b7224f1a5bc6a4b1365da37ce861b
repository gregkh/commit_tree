fault-injection: add tool to run command with failslab or fail_page_alloc

This adds tools/testing/fault-injection/failcmd.sh to run a command while
injecting slab/page allocation failures via fault injection.

Example:

Run a command "make -C tools/testing/selftests/ run_tests" with
injecting slab allocation failure.

	# ./tools/testing/fault-injection/failcmd.sh \
		-- make -C tools/testing/selftests/ run_tests

Same as above except to specify 100 times failures at most instead of
one time at most by default.

	# ./tools/testing/fault-injection/failcmd.sh --times=100 \
		-- make -C tools/testing/selftests/ run_tests

Same as above except to inject page allocation failure instead of slab
allocation failure.

	# env FAILCMD_TYPE=fail_page_alloc \
		./tools/testing/fault-injection/failcmd.sh --times=100 \
		-- make -C tools/testing/selftests/ run_tests
