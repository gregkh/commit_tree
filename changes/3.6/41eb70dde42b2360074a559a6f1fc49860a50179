ext4: use s_csum_seed instead of i_csum_seed for xattr block

In xattr block operation, we use h_refcount to indicate whether the
xattr block is shared among many inodes. And xattr block csum uses
s_csum_seed if it is shared and i_csum_seed if it belongs to
one inode. But this has a problem. So consider the block is shared
first bewteen inode A and B, and B has some xattr update and CoW
the xattr block. When it updates the *old* xattr block(because
of the h_refcount change) and calls ext4_xattr_release_block, we
has no idea that inode A is the real owner of the *old* xattr
block and we can't use the i_csum_seed of inode A either in xattr
block csum calculation. And I don't think we have an easy way to
find inode A.

So this patch just removes the tricky i_csum_seed and we now uses
s_csum_seed every time for the xattr block csum. The corresponding
patch for the e2fsprogs will be sent in another patch.

This is spotted by xfstests 117.
