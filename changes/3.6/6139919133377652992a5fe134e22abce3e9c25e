libceph: recheck con state after allocating incoming message

We drop the lock when calling the ->alloc_msg() con op, which means
we need to (a) not clobber con->in_msg without the mutex held, and (b)
we need to verify that we are still in the OPEN state when we retake
it to avoid causing any mayhem.  If the state does change, -EAGAIN
will get us back to con_work() and loop.
