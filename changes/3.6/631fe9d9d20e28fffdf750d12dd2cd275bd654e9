USB: EHCI: initialize data before resetting hardware

Currently, EHCI initialization turns off the controller (in case it
was left running by the firmware) before setting up the ehci_hcd data
structure.  This patch (as1565) reverses that order.

Although it doesn't matter now, it will matter later on when future
additions to ehci_halt() will want to acquire a spinlock that gets
initialized by ehci_init().
