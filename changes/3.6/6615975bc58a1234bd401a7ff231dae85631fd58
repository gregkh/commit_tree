ARM: OMAP: Add flag to indicate if a timer needs a manual reset

For OMAP1 devices, it is necessary to perform a manual reset of the timer.
Currently, this is indicating by setting the "needs_manual_reset" variable in
the platform data. Instead of using an extra variable to indicate this add a new
timer capabilities flag to indicate this and remove the "needs_manual_reset"
member from the platform data.
