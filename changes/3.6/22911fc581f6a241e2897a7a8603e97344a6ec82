net: skb_free_datagram_locked() doesnt drop all packets

dropwatch wrongly diagnose all received UDP packets as drops.

This patch removes trace_kfree_skb() done in skb_free_datagram_locked().

Locations calling skb_free_datagram_locked() should do it on their own.

As a result, drops are accounted on the right function.
