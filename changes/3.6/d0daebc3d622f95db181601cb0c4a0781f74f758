ipv4: Add interface option to enable routing of 127.0.0.0/8

Routing of 127/8 is tradtionally forbidden, we consider
packets from that address block martian when routing and do
not process corresponding ARP requests.

This is a sane default but renders a huge address space
practically unuseable.

The RFC states that no address within the 127/8 block should
ever appear on any network anywhere but it does not forbid
the use of such addresses outside of the loopback device in
particular. For example to address a pool of virtual guests
behind a load balancer.

This patch adds a new interface option 'route_localnet'
enabling routing of the 127/8 address block and processing
of ARP requests on a specific interface.

Note that for the feature to work, the default local route
covering 127/8 dev lo needs to be removed.

Example:
  $ sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.eth0.route_localnet=1
  $ ip route del 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo table local
  $ ip addr add 127.1.0.1/16 dev eth0
  $ ip route flush cache
