net/mlx4_core: Change resource tracking mechanism to use red-black tree

Change the data structure used for managing the SRIOV resource tracking
mechanism from radix tree to red-black tree. This is preparation step
for supporting resource IDs which are 64bit long, such as network flow
steering rules. Such IDs can't be used as radix-tree keys on 32bit
architectures and hence the reason for the change.
