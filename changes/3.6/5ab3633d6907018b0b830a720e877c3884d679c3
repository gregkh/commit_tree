drm/i915: make rc6 in sysfs functions conditional

Commit 0136db586c028f71e7cc21cc183064ff0d5919c8 merges rc6 information
into the power group. However, when compiled with CONFIG_PM not set,
modprobing i915 would taint since power_group_name is defined as NULL.

This patch makes these rc6 in sysfs functions conditional upon the
definition of the CONFIG_PM macro to avoid the above-mentioned problem.
