ARM: shmobile: add common extra gpio functions

Current gpio frame work doesn't have the method to control
just pull up/down/free, but some SH-ARM boards need such kind of operation.
This patch adds common extra gpio functions for SH-ARM.

But these functions should be replaced by correct
gpio function in the future.
