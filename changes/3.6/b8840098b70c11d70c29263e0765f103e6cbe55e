crypto: bfin_crc - CRC hardware driver for BF60x family processors.

The CRC peripheral is a hardware block used to compute the CRC of the block
of data. This is based on a CRC32 engine which computes the CRC value of 32b
data words presented to it. For data words of < 32b in size, this driver
pack 0 automatically into 32b data units. This driver implements the async
hash crypto framework API.
