workqueue: drop CPU_DYING notifier operation

Workqueue used CPU_DYING notification to mark GCWQ_DISASSOCIATED.
This was necessary because workqueue's CPU_DOWN_PREPARE happened
before other DOWN_PREPARE notifiers and workqueue needed to stay
associated across the rest of DOWN_PREPARE.

After the previous patch, workqueue's DOWN_PREPARE happens after
others and can set GCWQ_DISASSOCIATED directly.  Drop CPU_DYING and
let the trustee set GCWQ_DISASSOCIATED after disabling concurrency
management.
