VFS: Fix the banner comment on lookup_open()

Since commit 197e37d9, the banner comment on lookup_open() no longer matches
what the function returns.  It used to return a struct file pointer or NULL and
now it returns an integer and is passed the struct file pointer it is to use
amongst its arguments.  Update the comment to reflect this.

Also add a banner comment to atomic_open().
