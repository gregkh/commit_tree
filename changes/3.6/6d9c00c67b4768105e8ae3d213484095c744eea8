powerpc: Fix null pointer deref in perf hardware breakpoints

Currently if you are doing a global perf recording with hardware
breakpoints (ie perf record -e mem:0xdeadbeef -a), you can oops with:

  Faulting instruction address: 0xc000000000738890
  cpu 0xc: Vector: 300 (Data Access) at [c0000003f76af8d0]
      pc: c000000000738890: .hw_breakpoint_handler+0xa0/0x1e0
      lr: c000000000738830: .hw_breakpoint_handler+0x40/0x1e0
      sp: c0000003f76afb50
     msr: 8000000000001032

    current = 0xc0000003f765ac00
    paca    = 0xc00000000f262a00   softe: 0        irq_happened: 0x01
    pid   = 6810, comm = loop-read
  enter ? for help

  SP (ff8679e0) is in userspace

This is because we don't check to see if the break point is associated
with task before we deference the task_struct pointer.

This changes the update to use current.
