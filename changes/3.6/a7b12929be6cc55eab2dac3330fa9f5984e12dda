vt: fix race in vt_waitactive()

pm_restore_console() is called from the suspend/resume path, and this
calls vt_move_to_console(), which calls vt_waitactive().

There's a race in this path which causes the process which requests the
suspend to sleep indefinitely waiting for an event which already
happened:

P1                                      P2
 vt_move_to_console()
  set_console()
    schedule_console_callback()
  vt_waitactive()
    check n == fg_console +1
                                       console_callback()
                                         switch_screen()
                                         vt_event_post() // no waiters

    vt_event_wait() // forever

Fix the race by ensuring we're registered for the event before we check
if it's already completed.
