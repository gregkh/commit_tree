Bluetooth: A2MP: Do not reference hci_conn

Make A2MP channel special channel which do not reference hci_conn.
This prevents from keeping ACL connection open when all L2CAP
channels got closed.

hci_conn_hold and hci_conn_put are not reference counts on the
hci_conn structure in the typical way.  They are reference counts for
the ACL.  When you do the last hci_conn_put, the ACL is disconnected
after a timeout.
