libceph: fix overflow in __decode_pool_names()

`len' is read from network and thus needs validation.  Otherwise a
large `len' would cause out-of-bounds access via the memcpy() call.
In addition, len = 0xffffffff would overflow the kmalloc() size,
leading to out-of-bounds write.

This patch adds a check of `len' via ceph_decode_need().  Also use
kstrndup rather than kmalloc/memcpy.
