cuse: fix fuse_conn_kill()

fuse_conn_kill() removed fc->entry, called fuse_ctl_remove_conn() and
fuse_bdi_destroy().  None of which is appropriate for cuse cleanup.

The fuse_ctl_remove_conn() decrements the nlink on the control filesystem, which
is totally bogus.  The others are harmless but unnecessary.

So move these out from fuse_conn_kill() to fuse_put_super() where they belong.
