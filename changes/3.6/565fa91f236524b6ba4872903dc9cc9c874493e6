ARM: imx: clean and consolidate imx5 suspend and idle code

The imx5 idle code that existed in mm-imx5.c is moved to pm-imx5.c.
The imx5_pm_init call is now exported and called during the
MACHINE_START late_init in supported imx5 platforms.

Remove various enabling/disabling of the gpc_dvfs clock and
enable it once during initialization.  This is a very low
power clock that must be enabled during low power operations.

There are only two "suspend_state_t" imx5 low power modes ever
used.  STOP_POWER_OFF for suspend to mem and
WAIT_UNCLOCKED_POWER_OFF for idle and suspend to standby.  The
latter mode only requires 500 nanoseconds of extra hardware
exit time beyond a basic WFI operation (WAIT_CLOCKED mode) so
no other idle mode is necessary.  Given this information, it
is more efficient to keep the registers in the often used
WAIT_UNCLOCKED_POWER_OFF state and only to and from the
STOP_POWER_OFF register state as needed when suspend to
mem is required.
