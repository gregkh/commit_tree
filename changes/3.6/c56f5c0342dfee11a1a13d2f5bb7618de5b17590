Thermal: Make Thermal trip points writeable

Some of the thermal drivers using the Generic Thermal Framework
require (all/some) trip points to be writeable. This patch makes
the trip point temperatures writeable on a per-trip point basis,
and modifies the required function call in thermal.c. This patch
also updates the Documentation to reflect the new change.
