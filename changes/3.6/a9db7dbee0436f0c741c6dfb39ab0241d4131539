ASoC: when initializing CPU DAI, don't duplicate any CODEC init

If the CPU-side of a DAI link is a CODEC rather than a standalone DAI,
the codec initialization will call try_module_get() and create the DAI
widgets. Ensure that this isn't duplicated when the CPU DAI itself is
probed, if the CPU DAI is part of a CODEC.

Note that this is not a complete fix on its own, since there's no
guarantee that the CODEC itself will be initialized - currently that only
happens if the CODEC is also used as the CODEC-side of a DAI link, and
that initialization may happen before or after the DAIs within the CODEC
are initialized. However, such a scenario doesn't necessarily currently
work, and I don't think this change alone makes it any worse. This is
fixed in a couple patches time.
