powerpc/boot: Only build board support files when required.

Currently we build all board files regardless of the final zImage
target.  This is sub-optimal (in terms on compilation) and leads to
problems in one platform needlessly causing failures for other
platforms.

Use the Kconfig variables to selectively construct this board files to
build.
