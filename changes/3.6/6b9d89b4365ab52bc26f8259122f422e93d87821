drm: Add colouring to the range allocator

In order to support snoopable memory on non-LLC architectures (so that
we can bind vgem objects into the i915 GATT for example), we have to
avoid the prefetcher on the GPU from crossing memory domains and so
prevent allocation of a snoopable PTE immediately following an uncached
PTE. To do that, we need to extend the range allocator with support for
tracking and segregating different node colours.

This will be used by i915 to segregate memory domains within the GTT.

v2: Now with more drm_mm helpers and less driver interference.
