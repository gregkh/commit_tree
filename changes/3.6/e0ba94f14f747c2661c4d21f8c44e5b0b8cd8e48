x86/tlb_info: get last level TLB entry number of CPU

For 4KB pages, x86 CPU has 2 or 1 level TLB, first level is data TLB and
instruction TLB, second level is shared TLB for both data and instructions.

For hupe page TLB, usually there is just one level and seperated by 2MB/4MB
and 1GB.

Although each levels TLB size is important for performance tuning, but for
genernal and rude optimizing, last level TLB entry number is suitable. And
in fact, last level TLB always has the biggest entry number.

This patch will get the biggest TLB entry number and use it in furture TLB
optimizing.

Accroding Borislav's suggestion, except tlb_ll[i/d]_* array, other
function and data will be released after system boot up.

For all kinds of x86 vendor friendly, vendor specific code was moved to its
specific files.
