staging: comedi: cb_pcidas: remove the PCI BAR index defines

The defines for the "indices of the base address regions" don't
add much to the readability of the code. They are only used in
the pci_resource_start() calls to get the base address for
the various io regions and the names of the variables provide
adequate documentation.

Remove the defines and just use the open-coded values for the
BARs. Also, remove the incomplete comment above the initialization
of the variables.
