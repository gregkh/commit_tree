can: c_can_pci: fix compilation on non HAVE_CLK archs

In commit:

  5b92da0 c_can_pci: generic module for C_CAN/D_CAN on PCI

the c_can_pci driver has been added. It uses clk_*() functions
resulting in a link error on archs without clock support. This
patch removed these clk_() functions as these parts of the driver
are not tested.
