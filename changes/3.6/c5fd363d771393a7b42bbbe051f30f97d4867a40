cifs: move file_lock off stack in cifs_push_posix_locks

struct file_lock is pretty large, so we really don't want that on the
stack in a potentially long call chain. Reorganize the arguments to
CIFSSMBPosixLock to eliminate the need for that.

Eliminate the get_flag and simply use a non-NULL pLockInfo to indicate
that this is a "get" operation. In order to do that, need to add a new
loff_t argument for the start_offset.
