inetpeer: fix token initialization

When jiffies wraps around (for example, 5 minutes after the boot, see
INITIAL_JIFFIES) and peer has just been created, now - peer->rate_last can be
< XRLIM_BURST_FACTOR * timeout, so token is not set to the maximum value, thus
some icmp packets can be unexpectedly dropped.

Fix this case by initializing last_rate to 60 seconds in the past.
