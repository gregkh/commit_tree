x86/PCI: get rid of redundant log messages

For each resource of a PCI host bridge, the arch code and PCI
code log following messages.  We don't need both, so drop the
arch-specific printing.

    pci_root PNP0A08:00: host bridge window [io 0x0000-0x03af]
    pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0x03af]
