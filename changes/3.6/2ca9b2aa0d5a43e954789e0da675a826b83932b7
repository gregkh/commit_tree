net: fec: reset phy after pinctrl setup

In case that bootloader or platform initialization does not set up
fec pins, the fec_reset_phy will not be able to succeed, because
fec_reset_phy is currently called before devm_pinctrl_get_select_default.
Move fec_reset_phy call to the place between devm_pinctrl_get_select_default
and fec_enet_init to have above case be taken care.
