libceph: small changes to messenger.c

This patch gathers a few small changes in "net/ceph/messenger.c":
  out_msg_pos_next()
    - small logic change that mostly affects indentation
  write_partial_msg_pages().
    - use a local variable trail_off to represent the offset into
      a message of the trail portion of the data (if present)
    - once we are in the trail portion we will always be there, so we
      don't always need to check against our data position
    - avoid computing len twice after we've reached the trail
    - get rid of the variable tmpcrc, which is not needed
    - trail_off and trail_len never change so mark them const
    - update some comments
  read_partial_message_bio()
    - bio_iovec_idx() will never return an error, so don't bother
      checking for it
