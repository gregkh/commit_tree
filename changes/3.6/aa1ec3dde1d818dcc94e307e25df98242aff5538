net/mlx4_core: Change resource tracking ID to be 64 bit

Currently the IDs used by the resource tracker are of type u32, so far this was
ok since all the different resources we were tracking could be encoded in 32bit.

As a preparation step for tracking of resources whose IDs need > 32 bits such
as network flow steering rules, who are 64 bit in size, move to use 64 bit
based resource IDs.
