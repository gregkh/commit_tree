block: remove plugging at buffered write time

Buffered write(2) is not directly tied to IO, so it's not suitable to
handle plug in generic_file_aio_write().

Note that plugging for O_SYNC writes is also removed. The user may pass
arbitrary @size arguments, which may be much larger than the preferable
I/O size, or may cross extent/device boundaries. Let the lower layers
handle the plugging. The plugging code here actually turns them into
no-ops.
