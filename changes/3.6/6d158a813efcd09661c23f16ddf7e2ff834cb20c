tracing: Remove NR_CPUS array from trace_iterator

Replace the NR_CPUS array of buffer_iter from the trace_iterator
with an allocated array. This will just create an array of
possible CPUS instead of the max number specified.

The use of NR_CPUS in that array caused allocation failures for
machines that were tight on memory. This did not cause any failures
to the system itself (no crashes), but caused unnecessary failures
for reading the trace files.

Added a helper function called 'trace_buffer_iter()' that returns
the buffer_iter item or NULL if it is not defined or the array was
not allocated. Some routines do not require the array
(tracing_open_pipe() for one).
