powerpc: Enable jump label support

When looking through some instruction traces I noticed our tracepoint
checks were inline. It turns out we don't have CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL
enabled.

By enabling CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL we replace a load/compare/branch with
a nop at every tracepoint call. For example in do_IRQ:

CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL disabled:
        stdx 3,11,9
        lwz 0,8(29)
        cmpwi 7,0,0
        bne- 7,.L124
        bl .irq_enter

CONFIG_JUMP_LABEL enabled:
        stdx 3,11,9
        nop
        bl .irq_enter
