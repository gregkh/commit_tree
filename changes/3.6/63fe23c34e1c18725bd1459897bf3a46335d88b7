dmaengine: sa11x0-dma: fix DMA residue support

The semantics now implemented are:

- If the cookie has completed successfully, the residue will be zero.
- If the cookie is in progress or the channel is paused, it will be the
  number of bytes yet to be transferred. [*]
- If the cookie is queued, it will be the number of bytes in the
  descriptor.

* - where this is the number of bytes yet to be transferred to/from
  RAM.
