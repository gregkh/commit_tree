target: Fix possible integer underflow in UNMAP emulation

It's possible for an initiator to send us an UNMAP command with a
descriptor that is less than 8 bytes; in that case it's really bad for
us to set an unsigned int to that value, subtract 8 from it, and then
use that as a limit for our loop (since the value will wrap around to
a huge positive value).

Fix this by making size be signed and only looping if size >= 16 (ie
if we have at least a full descriptor available).

Also remove offset as an obfuscated name for the constant 8.
