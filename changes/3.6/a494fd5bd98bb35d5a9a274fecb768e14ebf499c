[SCSI] libsas: drop sata port multiplier infrastructure

On the way to add a new sata_device field, noticed that libsas is
carrying port multiplier infrastructure that is explicitly disabled by
sas_discover_sata().  The aic94xx touches the unused port_no, so leave
that field in case there was some use for it.
