[media] snd_tea575x: Add write_/read_val operations

Some devices which use the tea575x tuner chip don't allow bit banging the
lines, instead they offer a method to directly set / get the contents of the
25 bit shift-register in the chip. Notably the Griffin radioSHARK USB radio
receiver does this.
