bridge: fix rcu dereference outside of rcu_read_lock

Alternative solution for problem found by Linux Driver Verification
project (linuxtesting.org).

As it noted in the comment before the br_handle_frame_finish
function, this function should be called under rcu_read_lock.

The problem callgraph:
br_dev_xmit -> br_nf_pre_routing_finish_bridge_slow ->
 -> br_handle_frame_finish -> br_port_get_rcu -> rcu_dereference

And in this case there is no read-lock section.
