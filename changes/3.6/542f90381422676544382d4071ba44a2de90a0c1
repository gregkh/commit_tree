dm: support non power of two target max_io_len

Remove the restriction that limits a target's specified maximum incoming
I/O size to be a power of 2.

Rename this setting from 'split_io' to the less-ambiguous 'max_io_len'.
Change it from sector_t to uint32_t, which is plenty big enough, and
introduce a wrapper function dm_set_target_max_io_len() to set it.
Use sector_div() to process it now that it is not necessarily a power of 2.
