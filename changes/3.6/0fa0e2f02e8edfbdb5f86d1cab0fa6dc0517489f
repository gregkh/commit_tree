x86: Move call to print_modules() out of show_regs()

Printing the list of loaded modules is really unrelated to what
this function is about, and is particularly unnecessary in the
context of the SysRQ key handling (gets printed so far over and
over).

It should really be the caller of the function to decide whether
this piece of information is useful (and to avoid redundantly
printing it).
