memcg: prevent OOM with too many dirty pages

The current implementation of dirty pages throttling is not memcg aware
which makes it easy to have memcg LRUs full of dirty pages.  Without
throttling, these LRUs can be scanned faster than the rate of writeback,
leading to memcg OOM conditions when the hard limit is small.

This patch fixes the problem by throttling the allocating process
(possibly a writer) during the hard limit reclaim by waiting on
PageReclaim pages.  We are waiting only for PageReclaim pages because
those are the pages that made one full round over LRU and that means that
the writeback is much slower than scanning.

The solution is far from being ideal - long term solution is memcg aware
dirty throttling - but it is meant to be a band aid until we have a real
fix.  We are seeing this happening during nightly backups which are placed
into containers to prevent from eviction of the real working set.

The change affects only memcg reclaim and only when we encounter
PageReclaim pages which is a signal that the reclaim doesn't catch up on
with the writers so somebody should be throttled.  This could be
potentially unfair because it could be somebody else from the group who
gets throttled on behalf of the writer but as writers need to allocate as
well and they allocate in higher rate the probability that only innocent
processes would be penalized is not that high.

I have tested this change by a simple dd copying /dev/zero to tmpfs or
ext3 running under small memcg (1G copy under 5M, 60M, 300M and 2G
containers) and dd got killed by OOM killer every time.  With the patch I
could run the dd with the same size under 5M controller without any OOM.
The issue is more visible with slower devices for output.
