powerpc: Fixup oddity in entry_32.S

When I "fixed" the CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS case on interrupt entry,
I screwed up a little bit with the test for user space vs. kernel.

The code is fine, there's just some dead code around it. I basically
removed the test and always create the added stack frame whether
coming from user or kernel since in any case we do need to save
a bunch of volatile registers or bad things would happen (we can
take page faults in the kernel for example).
