workqueue: ROGUE workers are UNBOUND workers

Currently, WORKER_UNBOUND is used to mark workers for the unbound
global_cwq and WORKER_ROGUE is used to mark workers for disassociated
per-cpu global_cwqs.  Both are used to make the marked worker skip
concurrency management and the only place they make any difference is
in worker_enter_idle() where WORKER_ROGUE is used to skip scheduling
idle timer, which can easily be replaced with trustee state testing.

This patch replaces WORKER_ROGUE with WORKER_UNBOUND and drops
WORKER_ROGUE.  This is to prepare for removing trustee and handling
disassociated global_cwqs as unbound.
