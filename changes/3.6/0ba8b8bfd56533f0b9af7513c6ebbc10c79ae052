i2c-i801: Clear only status bits in HST_STS

Writing back the whole status register could clear unwanted bits.
In particular, it could clear the "INUSE_STS" bit, which is a
'hardware semaphore', that might be useful to use some day.
To prepare for this, let's ban writing back the whole status to register
HST_STS, of which this is the only instance.
