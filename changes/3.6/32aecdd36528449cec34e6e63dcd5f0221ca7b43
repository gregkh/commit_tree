slightly reduce idiocy in drivers/staging/bcm/Misc.c

a) vfs_llseek() does *not* access userland pointers of any kind
b) neither does filp_close(), for that matter
c) ... nor filp_open()
d) vfs_read() does, but we do have a wrapper for that (kernel_read()),
so there's no need to reinvent it.
e) passing current->files to filp_close() on something that never
had been in descriptor table is pointless.
