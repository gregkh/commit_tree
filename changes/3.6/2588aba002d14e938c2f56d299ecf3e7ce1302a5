pch_uart: Add eg20t_port lock field, avoid recursive spinlocks

pch_uart_interrupt() takes priv->port.lock which leads to two recursive
spinlock calls if low_latency==1 or CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT_FULL=y (one
otherwise):

pch_uart_interrupt
  spin_lock_irqsave(priv->port.lock, flags)
  case PCH_UART_IID_RDR_TO (data ready)
  handle_rx_to
    push_rx
      tty_port_tty_get
        spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock, flags) <--- already hold this lock
        ...
      tty_flip_buffer_push
        ...
        flush_to_ldisc
          spin_lock_irqsave(&tty->buf.lock)
            spin_lock_irqsave(&tty->buf.lock)
            disc->ops->receive_buf(tty, char_buf)
              n_tty_receive_buf
                tty->ops->flush_chars()
                uart_flush_chars
                  uart_start
                    spin_lock_irqsave(&port->lock) <--- already hold this lock

Avoid this by using a dedicated lock to protect the eg20t_port structure
and IO access to its membase. This is more consistent with the 8250
driver.  Ensure priv->lock is always take prior to priv->port.lock when
taken at the same time.

V2: Remove inadvertent whitespace change.
V3: Account for oops_in_progress for the private lock in
    pch_console_write().

Note: Like the 8250 driver, if a printk is introduced anywhere inside
      the pch_console_write() critical section, the kernel will hang
      on a recursive spinlock on the private lock. The oops case is
      handled by using a trylock in the oops_in_progress case.
