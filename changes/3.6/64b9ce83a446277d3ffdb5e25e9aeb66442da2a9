[media] v4l: Common documentation for selection targets

Both V4L2 and V4L2 subdev interface have very similar selection APIs with
differences foremost related to in-memory and media bus formats. However,
the selection targets are the same for both. Most targets are and in the
future will likely continue to be more the same than with any differences.
Thus it makes sense to unify the documentation of the targets.
