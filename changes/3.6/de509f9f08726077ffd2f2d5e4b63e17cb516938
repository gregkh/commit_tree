PCI: add Chelsio T310 10GbE NIC broken INTx masking quirk

According to

http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.emulators.kvm.devel/91388

the T310 does not properly support INTx masking as it fails to keep the
PCI_STATUS_INTERRUPT bit updated once the interrupt is masked. Mark this
adapter as broken so that pci_intx_mask_supported won't report it as
compatible.

[bhelgaas: use HEADER, not FINAL, which is currently broken for hotplug]
