workqueue: don't use WQ_HIGHPRI for unbound workqueues

Unbound wqs aren't concurrency-managed and try to execute work items
as soon as possible.  This is currently achieved by implicitly setting
%WQ_HIGHPRI on all unbound workqueues; however, WQ_HIGHPRI
implementation is about to be restructured and this usage won't be
valid anymore.

Add an explicit chain-wakeup path for unbound workqueues in
process_one_work() instead of piggy backing on %WQ_HIGHPRI.
