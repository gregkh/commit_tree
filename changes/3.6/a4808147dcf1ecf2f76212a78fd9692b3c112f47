seq_file: Add seq_vprintf function and export it

The existing seq_printf function is rewritten in terms of the new
seq_vprintf which is also exported to modules. This allows GFS2
(and potentially other seq_file users) to have a vprintf based
interface and to avoid an extra copy into a temporary buffer in
some cases.
