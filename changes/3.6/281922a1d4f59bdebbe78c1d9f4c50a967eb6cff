crypto: caam - add support for SEC v5.x RNG4

The SEC v4.x' RNGB h/w block self-initialized.  RNG4, available
on SEC versions 5 and beyond, is based on a different standard
that requires manual initialization.

Also update any new errors From the SEC v5.2 reference manual:
The SEC v5.2's RNG4 unit reuses some error IDs, thus the addition
of rng_err_id_list over the CHA-independent err_id_list.
