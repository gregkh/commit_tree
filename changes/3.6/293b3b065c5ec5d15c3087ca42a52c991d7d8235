NFSv4.1 do not send LAYOUTRETURN on emtpy plh_segs list

mark_matching_lsegs_invalid() resets the mds_threshold counters and can
dereference the layout hdr on an initial empty plh_segs list. It returns 0 both
in the case of an initial empty list and in a non-emtpy list that was cleared
by calls to mark_lseg_invalid.

Don't send a LAYOUTRETURN if the list was initially empty.
