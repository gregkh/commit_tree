regulator: core: remove sysfs entry properly in regulator_put

With changes introduced by commit 222cc7b (regulator: core: Allow
multiple requests of a single supply mapping) on create_regulator,
regulator_put needs a corresponding update on sysfs entry removing.

Also regulator->dev still needs to get assigned in create_regulator,
otherwise, sysfs_remove_link call in regulator_put will get bypassed.
