x86/mm/mtrr: Fix alignment determination in range_to_mtrr()

With the variable operated on being of "unsigned long" type,
neither ffs() nor fls() are suitable to use on them, as those
truncate their arguments to 32 bits. Using __ffs() and __fls()
respectively at once eliminates the need to subtract 1 from their
results.

Additionally, with the alignment value subsequently used as a
shift count, it must be enforced to be less than BITS_PER_LONG
(and on 64-bit there's no need for it to be any smaller).
