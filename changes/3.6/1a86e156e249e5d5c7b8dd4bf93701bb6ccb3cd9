USB: cdc-wdm: QMI devices are now handled by qmi_wwan

qmi_wwan has been changed to drive both the control and data
interface for all QMI/wwan devices, using cdc-wdm as a subdriver.
Remove the stale device ID entries from cdc-wdm.

>From now on new QMI/wwan devices will only need to be added to
the qmi_wwan driver, regardless of the USB descriptor layout

Note that this is not appropriate for stable/longterm kernels
despite being a device ID patch.
