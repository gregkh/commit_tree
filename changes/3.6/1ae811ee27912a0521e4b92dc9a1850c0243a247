NFS: Fix a regression when loading the NFS v4 module

Some systems have a modprobe.d/nfs.conf file that sets an nfs4 alias
pointing to nfs.ko, rather than nfs4.ko.  This can prevent the v4 module
from loading on mount, since the kernel sees that something named "nfs4"
has already been loaded.  To work around this, I've renamed the modules
to "nfsv2.ko" "nfsv3.ko" and "nfsv4.ko".

I also had to move the nfs4_fs_type back to nfs.ko to ensure that `mount
-t nfs4` still works.
