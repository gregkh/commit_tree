mm/page_alloc: fix the page address of higher page's buddy calculation

The heuristic method for buddy has been introduced since commit
43506fad21ca ("mm/page_alloc.c: simplify calculation of combined index
of adjacent buddy lists").  But the page address of higher page's buddy
was wrongly calculated, which will lead page_is_buddy to fail for ever.
IOW, the heuristic method would be disabled with the wrong page address
of higher page's buddy.

Calculating the page address of higher page's buddy should be based
higher_page with the offset between index of higher page and index of
higher page's buddy.
