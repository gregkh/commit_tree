brcmfmac: add debugfs helper functions

This patch adds debugfs support to brcmfmac. It provide helper functions
to setup the debugfs folder structure for the driver, which has following
hierarchy:

<debugfs_mount>/brcmfmac/<dev_name>/

ie.: /sys/kernel/debug/brcmfmac/mmc0:0001:2/

The new source file provides functions to create and remove the two
folders and a function to retrieve the device-specific folder so files
can be created in it.
