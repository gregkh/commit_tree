     Btrfs: put back delayed refs that are too new

I added a window where the delayed_ref's head->ref_mod code can diverge
from the sum of the remaining refs, because we release the head->mutex
in the middle. This leads to btrfs_lookup_extent_info returning wrong
numbers. This patch fixes this by adjusting the head's ref_mod with each
delayed ref we run.
