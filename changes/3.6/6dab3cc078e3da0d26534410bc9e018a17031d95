uprobes: Remove copy_vma()->uprobe_mmap()

Remove copy_vma()->uprobe_mmap(new_vma), it is absolutely wrong.

This new_vma was just initialized to represent the new unmapped
area, [vm_start, vm_end) was returned by get_unmapped_area() in
the caller.

This means that uprobe_mmap()->get_user_pages() will fail for
sure, simply because find_vma() can never succeed. And I
verified that sys_mremap()->mremap_to() indeed always fails with
the wrong ENOMEM code if [addr, addr+old_len] is probed.

And why this uprobe_mmap() was added? I believe the intent was
wrong. Note that the caller is going to do move_page_tables(),
all registered uprobes are already faulted in, we only change
the virtual addresses.

NOTE: However, somehow we need to close the race with
uprobe_register() which relies on map_info->vaddr. This needs
another fix I'll try to do later. Probably we need uprobe_mmap()
in move_vma() but we can not do this right now, this can confuse
uprobes_state.counter (which I still hope we are going to kill).
