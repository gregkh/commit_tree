Input: atmel_mxt_ts - send all MT-B slots in one input report

Each interrupt contains information for all contacts with changing
properties.  Process all of this information at once, and send it all in a
a single input report (ie input events ending in EV_SYN/SYN_REPORT).

This patch was tested using an MXT224E.
