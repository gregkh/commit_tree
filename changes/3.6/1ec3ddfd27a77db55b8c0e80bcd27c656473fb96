hwmon: (via-cputemp) Use get_online_cpus to avoid races involving CPU hotplug

via_cputemp_init loops with for_each_online_cpu, adding
platform_devices, then calls register_hotcpu_notifier.  If a CPU is
offlined between the loop and register_hotcpu_notifier, then later
onlined, via_cputemp_device_add will attempt to add platform devices
with the same ID.  A similar race occurs during via_cputemp_exit,
after the module calls unregister_hotcpu_notifier, a CPU might offline
and a device will exist for a CPU that is offline.

This fix surrounds for_each_online_cpu and register_hotcpu_notifier
with get_online_cpus+put_online_cpus; and surrounds
unregister_hotcpu_notifier and device unregistering with
get_online_cpus+put_online_cpus.

Build tested.
