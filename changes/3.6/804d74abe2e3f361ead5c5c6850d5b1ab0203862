drm: use drm_compat_ioctl for 32-bit apps

Most of the DRM drivers appear to be missing the .compat_ioctl file
operation entry necessary for 32-bit application compatibility.

This patch  uses drm_compat_ioctl for all drivers which don't have
their own, and which are using drm_ioctl for .unlocked_ioctl.

This leaves drivers/gpu/drm/psb/psb_drv.c unchanged; it has a custom
.unlocked_ioctl and will presumably need a custom .compat_ioctl as
well.
