delousing target_core_file a bit

* set_fs(KERNEL_DS) + getname() is probably the weirdest implementation
of strdup() I've seen.  Especially since they don't to copy it at all...
* filp_open() never returns NULL; it's ERR_PTR(-E...) on failure.
* file->f_dentry is never going to be NULL, TYVM.
* match_strdup() + snprintf() + kfree() is a bloody weird way to spell
match_strlcpy().

Pox on cargo-cult programmers...
