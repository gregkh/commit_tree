ARM: shmobile: mackerel: fixup usb module order

renesas_usbhs driver can play role as both Host and Gadget.
In case of Gadget, it requires not only renesas_usbhs
but also usb gadget module (like g_ether).
So, renesas_usbhs driver calls usb_add_gadget_udc() on probe time.

Because of this behavior,
Host port plays also Gadget role if kernel has both Host/Gadget support.

In mackerel case, from 0ada2da51800a4914887a9bcf22d563be80e50be
(ARM: mach-shmobile: mackerel: use renesas_usbhs instead of r8a66597_hcd)
usb0 plays Gadget role, and usb1 plays Host role,
and current mackerel board probes as usb1 -> usb0.
Thus, 1st installed usb gadget module (like g_ether) will be
assigned to usb1 (= usb Host port), and 2nd module to usb0 (= usb Gadget port).
It is very confusable for user.
This patch fixup usb modes probing order as usb0 -> usb1.
