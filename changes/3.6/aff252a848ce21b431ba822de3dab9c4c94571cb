ALSA: snd-usb: fix clock source validity index

uac_clock_source_is_valid() uses the control selector value to access
the bmControls bitmap of the clock source unit. This is wrong, as
control selector values start from 1, while the bitmap uses all
available bits.

In other words, "Clock Validity Control" is stored in D3..2, not D5..4
of the clock selector unit's bmControls.
