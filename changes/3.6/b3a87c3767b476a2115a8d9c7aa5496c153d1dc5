staging/ft1000: fix the no brace needed warning in ft1000_read_fifo_len

as the if else statements enclose only one line, so braces around them are not
needed.

The following warning is fixed

drivers/staging/ft1000/ft1000-pcmcia/ft1000_hw.c:100: WARNING: braces {} are not necessary for any arm of this statement
