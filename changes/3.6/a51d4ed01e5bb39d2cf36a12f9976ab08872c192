i915: Quirk no_lvds on Gigabyte GA-D525TUD ITX motherboard

This board is incorrectly detected as having an LVDS connector,
resulting in the VGA output (the only available output on the board)
showing the console only in the top-left 1024x768 pixels, and an extra
LVDS connector appearing in X.

It's a desktop Mini-ITX board using an Atom D525 CPU with an NM10
chipset.

I've had this board for about a year, but this is the first time I
noticed the issue because I've been running it headless for most of its
life.
