ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva: fixup: sound card detection order

Since armadillo800eva has 2 sound cards,
and had reversed deferred probe order issue,
it was purposely registered in reverse order.

But it was solved by
1d29cfa57471a5e4b8a7c2a7433eeba170d3ad92
(driver core: fixup reversed deferred probe order)

armadillo800eva board is expecting that
FSI-WM8978 is the 1st, and FSI-HDMI is the 2nd sound card.
This patch fixes it up
