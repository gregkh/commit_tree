apic: add apic_set_eoi_write for PV use

KVM PV EOI optimization overrides eoi_write apic op with its own
version. Add an API for this to avoid meddling with core x86 apic driver
data structures directly.

For KVM use, we don't need any guarantees about when the switch to the
new op will take place, so it could in theory use this API after SMP init,
but it currently doesn't, and restricting callers to early init makes it
clear that it's safe as it won't race with actual APIC driver use.
