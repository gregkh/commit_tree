net: em_canid: Ematch rule to match CAN frames according to their identifiers

This ematch makes it possible to classify CAN frames (AF_CAN) according
to their identifiers. This functionality can not be easily achieved with
existing classifiers, such as u32, because CAN identifier is always stored
in native endianness, whereas u32 expects Network byte order.
