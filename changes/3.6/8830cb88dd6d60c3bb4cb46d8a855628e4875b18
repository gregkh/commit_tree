Input: wacom_i2c - fix compiler warning

Apparently GCC can't figure out that we bail if we fail to query device
and will not try to use 'features':

drivers/input/touchscreen/wacom_i2c.c: In function ‘wacom_i2c_probe’:
drivers/input/touchscreen/wacom_i2c.c:177:20: warning: ‘features.fw_version’
	may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
