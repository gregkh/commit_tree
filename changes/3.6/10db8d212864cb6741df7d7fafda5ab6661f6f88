powerpc/eeh: Check handle_eeh_events() return value

Function eeh_event_handler() dereferences the pointer returned by
handle_eeh_events() without checking, causing a crash if NULL was
returned, which is expected in some situations.

This patch fixes this bug by checking for the value returned by
handle_eeh_events() before dereferencing it.
