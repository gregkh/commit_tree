memcg: rename MEM_CGROUP_CHARGE_TYPE_MAPPED as MEM_CGROUP_CHARGE_TYPE_ANON

Now, in memcg, 2 "MAPPED" enum/macro are found
 MEM_CGROUP_CHARGE_TYPE_MAPPED
 MEM_CGROUP_STAT_FILE_MAPPED

Thier names looks similar to each other but the former is used for
accounting anonymous memory. rename it as TYPE_ANON.
