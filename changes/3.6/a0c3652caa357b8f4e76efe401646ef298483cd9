spi: spi-coldfire-qspi: Drop extra spi_master_put in device remove function

The call sequence spi_alloc_master/spi_register_master/spi_unregister_master is
complete; it reduces the device reference count to zero, which and results in
device memory being freed. The subsequent call to spi_master_put is unnecessary
and results in an access to free memory. Drop it.
