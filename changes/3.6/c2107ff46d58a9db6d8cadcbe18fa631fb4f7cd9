staging: comedi: cb_das16_cs: refactor the pcmcia attach/detach

Move the pcmcia_disable_device() call where needed in the
pcmcia attach/detach and delete the das16cs_pcmcia_release()
function.

Move the logic of das16cs_pcmcia_config() directly into the
attach function and properly return an error code when the
config fails.

Only set the cur_dev, used by the comedi_driver, if the pcmcia
attach is successful. Also, make sure to NULL it in the detach.

Remove all the kernel messages in the pcmcia support code. They
are just added noise.
