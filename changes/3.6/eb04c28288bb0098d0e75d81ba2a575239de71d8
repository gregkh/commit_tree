fs: Add freezing handling to mnt_want_write() / mnt_drop_write()

Most of places where we want freeze protection coincides with the places where
we also have remount-ro protection. So make mnt_want_write() and
mnt_drop_write() (and their _file alternative) prevent freezing as well.
For the few cases that are really interested only in remount-ro protection
provide new function variants.
