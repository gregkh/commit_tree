svcrpc: fix svc_xprt_enqueue/svc_recv busy-looping

The rpc server tries to ensure that there will be room to send a reply
before it receives a request.

It does this by tracking, in xpt_reserved, an upper bound on the total
size of the replies that is has already committed to for the socket.

Currently it is adding in the estimate for a new reply *before* it
checks whether there is space available.  If it finds that there is not
space, it then subtracts the estimate back out.

This may lead the subsequent svc_xprt_enqueue to decide that there is
space after all.

The results is a svc_recv() that will repeatedly return -EAGAIN, causing
server threads to loop without doing any actual work.
