MTD: NAND: JZ4740: Multi-bank support with autodetection

The platform data can now specify which external memory banks to probe
for NAND chips, and in which order. Banks that contain a NAND are used
and the other banks are freed.

Squashed version of development done in jz-2.6.38 branch.
Original patch by Lars-Peter Clausen with some bug fixes from me.
Thanks to Paul Cercueil for the initial autodetection patch.
