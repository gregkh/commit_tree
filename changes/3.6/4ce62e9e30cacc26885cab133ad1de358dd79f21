workqueue: introduce NR_WORKER_POOLS and for_each_worker_pool()

Introduce NR_WORKER_POOLS and for_each_worker_pool() and convert code
paths which need to manipulate all pools in a gcwq to use them.
NR_WORKER_POOLS is currently one and for_each_worker_pool() iterates
over only @gcwq->pool.

Note that nr_running is per-pool property and converted to an array
with NR_WORKER_POOLS elements and renamed to pool_nr_running.  Note
that get_pool_nr_running() currently assumes 0 index.  The next patch
will make use of non-zero index.

The changes in this patch are mechanical and don't caues any
functional difference.  This is to prepare for multiple pools per
gcwq.

v2: nr_running indexing bug in get_pool_nr_running() fixed.

v3: Pointer to array is stupid.  Don't use it in get_pool_nr_running()
    as suggested by Linus.
