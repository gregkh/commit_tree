rcu: Move rcu_barrier_cpu_count to rcu_state structure

In order to allow each RCU flavor to concurrently execute its rcu_barrier()
function, it is necessary to move the relevant state to the rcu_state
structure.  This commit therefore moves the rcu_barrier_cpu_count global
variable to a new ->barrier_cpu_count field in the rcu_state structure.
