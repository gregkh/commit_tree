pstore: Add persistent function tracing

With this support kernel can save function call chain log into a
persistent ram buffer that can be decoded and dumped after reboot
through pstore filesystem. It can be used to determine what function
was last called before a reset or panic.

We store the log in a binary format and then decode it at read time.

p.s.
Mostly the code comes from trace_persistent.c driver found in the
Android git tree, written by Colin Cross <ccross@android.com>
(according to sign-off history). I reworked the driver a little bit,
and ported it to pstore.
