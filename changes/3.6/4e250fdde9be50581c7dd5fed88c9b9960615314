time: Remove all direct references to timekeeper

Ingo noted that the numerous timekeeper.value references made
the timekeeping code ugly and caused many long lines that
had to be broken up. He recommended replacing timekeeper.value
references with tk->value.

This patch provides a local tk value for all top level time
functions and sets it to &timekeeper. Then all timekeeper
access is done via a tk pointer.
