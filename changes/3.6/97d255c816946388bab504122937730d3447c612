mm: do not use page_count() without a page pin

d179e84ba ("mm: vmscan: do not use page_count without a page pin") fixed
this problem in vmscan.c but same problem is in __count_immobile_pages().

I copy and paste d179e84ba's contents for description.

"It is unsafe to run page_count during the physical pfn scan because
compound_head could trip on a dangling pointer when reading
page->first_page if the compound page is being freed by another CPU."
