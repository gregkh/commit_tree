workqueue: use @pool instead of @gcwq or @cpu where applicable

Modify all functions which deal with per-pool properties to pass
around @pool instead of @gcwq or @cpu.

The changes in this patch are mechanical and don't caues any
functional difference.  This is to prepare for multiple pools per
gcwq.
