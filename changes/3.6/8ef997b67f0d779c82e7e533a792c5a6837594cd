ARM: 7534/1: clk: Make the managed clk functions generically available

The managed clk functions are currently only available when the generic clk
lookup framework is build. But the managed clk functions are merely wrappers
around clk_get and clk_put and do not depend on any specifics of the generic
lookup functions and there are still quite a few custom implementations of the
clk API. So make the managed functions available whenever the clk API is
implemented.

The patch also removes the custom implementation of devm_clk_get for the
coldfire platform.
