rtc: wm831x: Feed the write counter into device_add_randomness()

The tamper evident features of the RTC include the "write counter" which
is a pseudo-random number regenerated whenever we set the RTC. Since this
value is unpredictable it should provide some useful seeding to the random
number generator.

Only do this on boot since the goal is to seed the pool rather than add
useful entropy.
