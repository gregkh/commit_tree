[SCSI] Stop accepting SCSI requests before removing a device

Avoid that the code for requeueing SCSI requests triggers a
crash by making sure that that code isn't scheduled anymore
after a device has been removed.

Also, source code inspection of __scsi_remove_device() revealed
a race condition in this function: no new SCSI requests must be
accepted for a SCSI device after device removal started.
