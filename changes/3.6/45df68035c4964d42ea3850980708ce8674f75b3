drm/radeon: record what is next valid wptr for each ring v4

Before emitting any indirect buffer, emit the offset of the next
valid ring content if any. This allow code that want to resume
ring to resume ring right after ib that caused GPU lockup.

v2: use scratch registers instead of storing it into memory
v3: skip over the surface sync for ni and si as well
v4: use SET_CONFIG_REG instead of PACKET0
