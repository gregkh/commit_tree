netfilter: nf_ct_sip: fix IPv6 address parsing

Within SIP messages IPv6 addresses are enclosed in square brackets in most
cases, with the exception of the "received=" header parameter. Currently
the helper fails to parse enclosed addresses.

This patch:

- changes the SIP address parsing function to enforce square brackets
  when required, and accept them when not required but present, as
  recommended by RFC 5118.

- adds a new SDP address parsing function that never accepts square
  brackets since SDP doesn't use them.

With these changes, the SIP helper correctly parses all test messages
from RFC 5118 (Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Torture Test Messages
for Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6)).
