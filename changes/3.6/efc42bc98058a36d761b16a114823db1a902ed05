scatterlist: add sg_alloc_table_from_pages function

This patch adds a new constructor for an sg table. The table is constructed
from an array of struct pages. All contiguous chunks of the pages are merged
into a single sg nodes. A user may provide an offset and a size of a buffer if
the buffer is not page-aligned.

The function is dedicated for DMABUF exporters which often perform conversion
from an page array to a scatterlist. Moreover the scatterlist should be
squashed in order to save memory and to speed-up the process of DMA mapping
using dma_map_sg.

The code is based on the patch 'v4l: vb2-dma-contig: add support for
scatterlist in userptr mode' and hints from Laurent Pinchart.
