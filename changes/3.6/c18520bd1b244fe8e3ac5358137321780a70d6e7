net/mlx4_en: Fixing TX queue stop/wake flow

Removing the ring->blocked flag, it is redundant and leads to a race:

We close the TX queue and then set the "blocked" flag.
Between those 2 operations the completion function can check the "blocked"
flag, sees that it is 0, and wouldn't open the TX queue.

Using netif_tx_queue_stopped to check the state of the queue to avoid this race.
