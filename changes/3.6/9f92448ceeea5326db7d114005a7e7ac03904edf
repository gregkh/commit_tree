uprobes: Clean up and document write_opcode()->lock_page(old_page)

The comment above write_opcode()->lock_page(old_page) tells
about the race with do_wp_page(). I don't really understand
which exactly race it means, but afaics this lock_page() was not
enough to close all races with do_wp_page().

Anyway, since:

   77fc4af1b59d uprobes: Change register_for_each_vma() to take mm->mmap_sem for writing

this code is always called with ->mmap_sem held for writing,
so we can forget about do_wp_page().

However, we can't simply remove this lock_page(), and the only
(afaics) reason is __replace_page()->try_to_free_swap().

Nothing in write_opcode() needs it, move it into
__replace_page() and fix the comment.
