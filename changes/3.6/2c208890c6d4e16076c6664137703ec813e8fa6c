wireless: Remove casts to same type

Adding casts of objects to the same type is unnecessary
and confusing for a human reader.

For example, this cast:

        int y;
        int *p = (int *)&y;

I used the coccinelle script below to find and remove these
unnecessary casts.  I manually removed the conversions this
script produces of casts with __force, __iomem and __user.

@@
type T;
T *p;
@@

-       (T *)p
+       p

Neatened the mwifiex_deauthenticate_infra function which
was doing odd things with array pointers and not using
is_zero_ether_addr.
