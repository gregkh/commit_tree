mwifiex: correction in mcs index check

mwifiex driver supports 2x2 chips as well. Hence valid mcs values
are 0 to 15. The check for mcs index is corrected in this patch.

For example: if 40MHz is enabled and mcs index is 11, "iw link"
command would show "tx bitrate: 108.0 MBit/s" without this patch.
Now it shows "tx bitrate: 108.0 MBit/s MCS 11 40Mhz" with the patch.
