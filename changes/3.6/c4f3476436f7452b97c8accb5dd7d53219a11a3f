USB: EHCI: fix up locking

This patch (as1588) adjusts the locking in ehci-hcd's various halt,
shutdown, and suspend/resume pathways.  We want to hold the spinlock
while writing device registers and accessing shared variables, but not
while polling in a loop.

In addition, there's no need to call ehci_work() at times when no URBs
can be active, i.e., in ehci_stop() and ehci_bus_suspend().

Finally, ehci_adjust_port_wakeup_flags() is called only in situations
where interrupts are enabled; therefore it can use spin_lock_irq
rather than spin_lock_irqsave.
