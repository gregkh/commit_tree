    drm/i915: fix pixel color depth setting on eDP

Since then we've fixed up the dp link bandwidth calculation code and
should now automatically fall back to 6bpc dithering. So this is
unnecessary.

Furthermore it seems to break the new MacbookPro with retina display,
hence let's just rip this out.

Testing feedback highgly welcome, and thanks for Benoit for finding
out that the bpc computations are busted.
