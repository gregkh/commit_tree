rtlwifi: rtl8192ce: Log message that B_CUT device may not work

There are a number of problems that occur for the latest version
of the Realtek RTL8188CE device with the in-kernel driver. These
include selection of the wrong firmware, and system lockup. A full
fix is known, but is too invasive for inclusion in stable. This patch
fixes the problem with loading the wrong firmware, and logs a message
that the device may not work for kernels 3.6 and older.
