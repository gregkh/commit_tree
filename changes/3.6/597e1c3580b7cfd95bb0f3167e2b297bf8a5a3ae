mm/mmu_gather: enable tlb flush range in generic mmu_gather

This patch enabled the tlb flush range support in generic mmu layer.

Most of arch has self tlb flush range support, like ARM/IA64 etc.
X86 arch has no this support in hardware yet. But another instruction
'invlpg' can implement this function in some degree. So, enable this
feather in generic layer for x86 now. and maybe useful for other archs
in further.

Generic mmu_gather struct is protected by micro
HAVE_GENERIC_MMU_GATHER. Other archs that has flush range supported
own self mmu_gather struct. So, now this change is safe for them.

In future we may unify this struct and related functions on multiple
archs.

Thanks for Peter Zijlstra time and time reminder for multiple
architecture code safe!
