HID: Fix logitech-dj: missing Unifying device issue

This patch fixes an issue introduced after commit 4ea5454203d991ec
("HID: Fix race condition between driver core and ll-driver").

After that commit, hid-core discards any incoming packet that arrives while
hid driver's probe function is being executed.

This broke the enumeration process of hid-logitech-dj, that must receive
control packets in-band with the mouse and keyboard packets. Discarding mouse
or keyboard data at the very begining is usually fine, but it is not the case
for control packets.

This patch forces a re-enumeration of the paired devices when a packet arrives
that comes from an unknown device.

Based on a patch originally written by Benjamin Tissoires.
