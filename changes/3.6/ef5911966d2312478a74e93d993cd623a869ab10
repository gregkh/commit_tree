ARM: vexpress: remove automatic errata workaround selection

The vexpress Kconfig setup tries to be clever^Whelpful and selects some
errata workarounds for certain revisions of the Cortex-A9 and PL310,
which may be required depending on the core tile.

Since the mach-vexpress can support A5, A7 and A15 coretiles, let's
make errata workaround selection optional.
