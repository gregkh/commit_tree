regulator: tps65217: Convert LDO1 to use regulator_list_voltage_table

Convert tps65217_pmic_ldo1_ops to use regulator_list_voltage_table.

We have n_voltages and volt_table settings in regulator_desc,
so we don't need the table and table_len fields in struct tps_info.
Thus remove them from struct tps_info.
