Revert "openvswitch: potential NULL deref in sample()"

This reverts commit 5b3e7e6cb5771bedda51cdb6f715d1da8cd9e644.

The problem that the original commit was attempting to fix can
never happen in practice because validation is done one a per-flow
basis rather than a per-packet basis.  Adding additional checks at
runtime is unnecessary and inconsistent with the rest of the code.
