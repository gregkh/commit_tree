x86/uv: Implement UV BAU runtime enable and disable control via /proc/sgi_uv/

This patch enables the BAU to be turned on or off dynamically.

  echo "on"  > /proc/sgi_uv/ptc_statistics
  echo "off" > /proc/sgi_uv/ptc_statistics

The system may be booted with or without the nobau option.

Whether the system currently has the BAU off can be seen in
the /proc file -- normally with the baustats script.
Each cpu will have a 1 in the bauoff field if the BAU was turned
off, so baustats will give a count of cpus that have it off.
