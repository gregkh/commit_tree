scripts/coccinelle: Find threaded IRQs requests which are missing IRQF_ONESHOT

Since commit 1c6c69525b ("genirq: Reject bogus threaded irq requests") threaded
IRQs without a primary handler need to be requested with IRQF_ONESHOT, otherwise
the request will fail. This semantic patch will help to statically identify
(and fix) such cases.
