I2C: OMAP: Don't check if wait_for_completion_timeout() returns less than zero

By definition, wait_for_completion_timeout() returns an unsigned value and
therefore, it is not necessary to check if the return value is less than zero
as this is not possible.

This is based on a patch from Jon Hunter <jon-hunter@ti.com>
Changes from his patch
- Declare a long as the wait_for_completion_timeout returns long.
