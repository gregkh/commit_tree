libceph: use con get/put ops from osd_client

There were a few direct calls to ceph_con_{get,put}() instead of the con
ops from osd_client.c.  This is a bug since those ops aren't defined to
be ceph_con_get/put.

This breaks refcounting on the ceph_osd structs that contain the
ceph_connections, and could lead to all manner of strangeness.

The purpose of the ->get and ->put methods in a ceph connection are
to allow the connection to indicate it has a reference to something
external to the messaging system, *not* to indicate something
external has a reference to the connection.
