mmc: card: Skip secure erase on MoviNAND; causes unrecoverable corruption.

For several MoviNAND eMMC parts, there are known issues with secure
erase and secure trim.  For these specific MoviNAND devices, we skip
these operations.

Specifically, there is a bug in the eMMC firmware that causes
unrecoverable corruption when the MMC is erased with MMC_CAP_ERASE
enabled.
