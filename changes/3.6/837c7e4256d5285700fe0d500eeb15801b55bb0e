[media] v4l2-dev: G_PARM was incorrectly enabled for all video nodes

G_PARM should only be enabled if:

- vidioc_g_parm is present
- or: it is a video node and vidioc_g_std or tvnorms are set.

Without this additional check v4l2-compliance would complain about
being able to use g_parm when it didn't expect it.
