slub: Get rid of the node field

The node field is always page_to_nid(c->page). So its rather easy to
replace. Note that there maybe slightly more overhead in various hot paths
due to the need to shift the bits from page->flags. However, that is mostly
compensated for by a smaller footprint of the kmem_cache_cpu structure (this
patch reduces that to 3 words per cache) which allows better caching.
