perf kvm: Guest userspace samples should not be lumped with host uspace

e.g., perf kvm --host  --guest report -i perf.data --stdio -D
shows:

1 599127912065356 0x143b8 [0x48]: PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE(IP, 5): 5671/5676: 0x7fdf95a061c0 period: 1 addr: 0
... chain: nr:2
.....  0: ffffffffffffff80
.....  1: fffffffffffffe00
 ... thread: qemu-kvm:5671
 ...... dso: <not found>

(IP, 5) means sample in guest userspace. Those samples should not be lumped
into the VMM's host thread. i.e, the report output:

    56.86%  qemu-kvm  [unknown]         [u] 0x00007fdf95a061c0

With this patch the output emphasizes it is a guest userspace hit:

    56.86%  [guest/5671]  [unknown]         [u] 0x00007fdf95a061c0

Looking at 3 VMs (2 64-bit, 1 32-bit) with each running a CPU bound
process (openssl speed), perf report currently shows:

  93.84%  117726   qemu-kvm  [unknown]   [u] 0x00007fd7dcaea8e5

which is wrong. With this patch you get:

  31.50%   39258   [guest/18772]  [unknown]   [u] 0x00007fd7dcaea8e5
  31.50%   39236   [guest/11230]  [unknown]   [u] 0x0000000000a57340
  30.84%   39232   [guest/18395]  [unknown]   [u] 0x00007f66f641e107
