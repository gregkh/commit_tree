dlm: fix missing dir remove

I don't know exactly how, but in some cases, a dir
record is not removed, or a new one is created when
it shouldn't be.  The result is that the dir node
lookup returns a master node where the rsb does not
exist.  In this case, The master node will repeatedly
return -EBADR for requests, and the lock requests will
be stuck.

Until all possible ways for this to happen can be
eliminated, a simple and effective way to recover from
this situation is for the supposed master node to send
a standard remove message to the dir node when it
receives a request for a resource it has no rsb for.
