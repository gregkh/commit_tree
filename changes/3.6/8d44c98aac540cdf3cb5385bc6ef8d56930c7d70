dm persistent data: always unlock superblock in dm_bm_flush_and_unlock

Unlock the superblock even if initial dm_bufio_write_dirty_buffers fails.

Also, remove redundant flush calls.  dm_bm_flush_and_unlock's calls to
dm_bufio_write_dirty_buffers already result in dm_bufio_issue_flush
being called.

This avoids warnings about unflushed dirty buffers from bufio.
