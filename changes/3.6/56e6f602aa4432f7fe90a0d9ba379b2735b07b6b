perf tool: Save cmdline from user in file header vs what is passed to record

A number of builtin commands process some user args and then pass the rest to
cmd_record. cmd_record then saves argc/argv that it receives into the header of
the perf data file. But this loses the arguments handled by the first command
-- ie., the real command line from the user. This patch saves the command line
as typed by the user rather than what was passed to cmd_record.

As an example consider the command:
$ perf kvm --guest --host --guestmount=/tmp/guest-mount record
    -fo /tmp/perf.data -ag -- sleep 10

Currently the command saved to the header is:
    cmdline : /tmp/p3.5/perf record -o perf.data.kvm -fo /tmp/perf.data -ag -- sleep 1

(ignore the duplicated -o -- the first would be yet another bug with perf-kvm).

With this patch the command line saved to the header is:
cmdline : /tmp/p3.5/perf kvm --guest --host --guestmount=/tmp/guest-mount
    record -fo /tmp/perf.data -ag -- sleep 1

v2: simplified to saving the command in parse_options per Stephane's suggestion
