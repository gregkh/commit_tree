x86/x2apic/cluster: Use all the members of one cluster specified in the smp_affinity mask for the interrupt destination

If the HW implements round-robin interrupt delivery, this
enables multiple cpu's (which are part of the user specified
interrupt smp_affinity mask and belong to the same x2apic
cluster) to service the interrupt.

Also if the platform supports Power Aware Interrupt Routing,
then this enables the interrupt to be routed to an idle cpu or a
busy cpu depending on the perf/power bias tunable.

We are now grouping all the cpu's in a cluster to one vector
domain. So that will limit the total number of interrupt sources
handled by Linux. Previously we support "cpu-count *
available-vectors-per-cpu" interrupt sources but this will now
reduce to "cpu-count/16 * available-vectors-per-cpu".
