KEYS: Fix some sparse warnings

Fix some sparse warnings in the keyrings code:

 (1) compat_keyctl_instantiate_key_iov() should be static.

 (2) There were a couple of places where a pointer was being compared against
     integer 0 rather than NULL.

 (3) keyctl_instantiate_key_common() should not take a __user-labelled iovec
     pointer as the caller must have copied the iovec to kernel space.

 (4) __key_link_begin() takes and __key_link_end() releases
     keyring_serialise_link_sem under some circumstances and so this should be
     declared.

     Note that adding __acquires() and __releases() for this doesn't help cure
     the warnings messages - something only commenting out both helps.
