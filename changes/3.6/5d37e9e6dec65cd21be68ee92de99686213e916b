fs: Skip atime update on frozen filesystem

It is unexpected to block reading of frozen filesystem because of atime update.
Also handling blocking on frozen filesystem because of atime update would make
locking more complex than it already is. So just skip atime update when
filesystem is frozen like we skip it when filesystem is remounted read-only.
