[SCSI] Revert "[SCSI] fix async probe regression"

This reverts commit 43a8d39d0137612c336aa8bbb2cb886a79772ffb.

Commit 43a8d39d fixed the fact that wait_for_device_probe() was unable
to flush sd probe work.  Now that sd probe work is once again flushable
via wait_for_device_probe() this workaround is no longer needed.
