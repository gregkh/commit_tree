[media] bttv-cards.c: Allow radio for CHP05x/CHP06x

Add ".has_radio = 1" for BTTV_BOARD_MAGICTVIEW061 because there are
some CHP05x/CHP06x boards with a radio tuner.

I still have an analog Askey Magic TView card (CHP051, PCI 144f:3002)
which I use for radio only. This worked fine with kernel 2.6.37
(openSUSE 11.4), but no longer works with kernel 3.1.10 (openSUSE 12.1).

The reason apparently is that ".has_radio = 1" is missing in
bttv-cards.c for BTTV_BOARD_MAGICTVIEW061; when I add this line and
recompile the kernel, radio is working again. The line is still missing
in the latest git tree, for which I have generated the attached patch.

I can't test what will happen for CHP05x/CHP06x devices without radio;
however, it seems that other cards also have the problem that there are
some boards with radio and some without, so I hope that this can be
sorted out.
