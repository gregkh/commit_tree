regulator: Add ramp_delay configuration to constraints

For some hardwares ramp_delay for BUCKs is a configurable parameter which can
be configured through DT or board file.This patch adds ramp_delay to regulator
constraints and allow user to configure it for regulators which supports this
feature, through DT or board file. It will provide two ways of setting the
ramp_delay for a regulator:
	First, by setting it as constraints in board file(for configurable
regulators) and set_machine_constraints() will take care of setting it on
hardware by calling(the provided) .set_ramp_delay() operation(callback).
	Second, by setting it as data in regulator_desc(as fixed/default
ramp_delay rate) for a regulator in driver.

regulator_set_voltage_time_sel() will give preference to
constraints->ramp_delay while reading ramp_delay rate for regulator. Similarly
users should also take care accordingly while refering ramp_delay rate(in case
of implementing their private .set_voltage_time_sel() callbacks for different
regulators).
