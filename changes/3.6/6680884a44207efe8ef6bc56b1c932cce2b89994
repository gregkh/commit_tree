Input: ad7879 - add option to correct xy axis

Sebastian Zenker reported that driver swaps x and y samples when the
touchscreen leads are connected in accordance with the datasheet
specification.  Transposed axis can be typically corrected by touch
screen calibration however this bug also negatively influences touch
pressure measurements.

Add an option to correct x and y axis.
