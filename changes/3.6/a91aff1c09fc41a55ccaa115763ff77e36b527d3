staging:iio: Request threaded-only IRQs with IRQF_ONESHOT

Since commit 1c6c69525b ("genirq: Reject bogus threaded irq requests") threaded
IRQs without a primary handler need to be requested with IRQF_ONESHOT, otherwise
the request will fail. This patch adds the IRQF_ONESHOT to IIO drivers where it
is missing.
