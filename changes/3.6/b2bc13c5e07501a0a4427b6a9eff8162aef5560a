Staging: ipack: delete the call to remove() in ipack_driver_register

When a bus driver calls ipack_driver_register(), it should manages the returning
NULL value to undo all the operations it did before this call, and print the
corresponding trace.

It is not a task for the ipack driver to call the remove() function here.
