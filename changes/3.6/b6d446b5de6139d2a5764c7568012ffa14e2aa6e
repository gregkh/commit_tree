staging: comedi: amplc_pc236: store the pci_dev in the comedi_device

Use the hw_dev pointer in the comedi_device struct to hold the
pci_dev instead of carrying it in the private data.

Since the pci_dev is no longer held in the provate data, we can
also cleanup the detach a bit. Remove the IS_ENABLED() tests in
the detach. If the pci_dev is non NULL it's a PCI device otherwise
it's an ISA device. Using IS_ENABLED() to omit the code paths
makes the code a bit confusing and doesn't save much.
