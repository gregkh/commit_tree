eCryptfs: check for eCryptfs cipher support at mount

The issue occurs when eCryptfs is mounted with a cipher supported by
the crypto subsystem but not by eCryptfs. The mount succeeds and an
error does not occur until a write. This change checks for eCryptfs
cipher support at mount time.

Resolves Launchpad issue #338914, reported by Tyler Hicks in 03/2009.
