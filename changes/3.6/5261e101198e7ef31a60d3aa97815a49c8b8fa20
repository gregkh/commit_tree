mfd: Update db8500-prmcu hostport_access enable

Force the Modem wakeup by asserting the CaWakeReq signal before the
hostaccess_req/ack ping-pong sequence. The Awake_req signal is de-asserted
asserted at the same time than the hostaccess_req. Return error on failure
case so that the client using this can take appropiate steps.
