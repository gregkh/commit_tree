ALSA: hda - Turn on PIN_OUT from hdmi playback prepare.

Turn on the pin widget's PIN_OUT bit from playback prepare. The pin is
enabled in open, but is disabled in hdmi_init_pin which is called during
system resume.  This causes a system suspend/resume during playback to
mute HDMI/DP. Enabling the pin in prepare instead of open allows calling
snd_pcm_prepare after a system resume to restore audio.
