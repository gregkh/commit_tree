iwlwifi: disable the watchdog for queues by default

I saw that when the watchdog triggers, the packets do go
through if we wait enough time. So we still have an issue
where packets are blocked in the Tx queue for a short while
and this needs to be debugged separately. For now, don't
restart the driver when it is not needed.
