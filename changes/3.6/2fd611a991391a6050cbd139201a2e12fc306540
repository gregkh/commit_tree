uprobes: Suppress uprobe_munmap() from mmput()

uprobe_munmap() does get_user_pages() and it is also called from
the final mmput()->exit_mmap() path. This slows down
exit/mmput() for no reason, and I think  it is simply
dangerous/wrong to try to fault-in a page into the dying mm. If
nothing else, this happens after the last sync_mm_rss(), afaics
handle_mm_fault() can change the task->rss_stat and make the
subsequent check_mm() unhappy.

Change uprobe_munmap() to check mm->mm_users != 0.
