ath9k: fix PA linearization calibration related crash

Before PAPRD training can run, the card needs to have sent a packet for
thermal calibration. Sending a dummy packet with the PAPRD training flag
set causes a crash under some circumstance.
Fix the code by replacing the dummy tx with a delay that waits for a
real packet tx to have occurred.
