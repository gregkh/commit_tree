GFS2: Fix error handling when reading an invalid block from the journal

When we read an invalid block from the journal, we should not call
withdraw, but simply print a message and return an error. It is
up to the caller to then handle that error. In the case of mount
that means a failed mount, rather than a withdraw (requiring a
reboot). In the case of recovering another nodes journal then
we return an error via the uevent.
