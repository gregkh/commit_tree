ACPI, APEI: Fixup common access width firmware bug

Many firmwares have a common register definition bug where 8-bit
access width is specified for a 32-bit register. Ideally this should
be fixed in the BIOS, but earlier versions of the kernel did not
complain, so fix that up silently.

This closes kernel bug #43282:
