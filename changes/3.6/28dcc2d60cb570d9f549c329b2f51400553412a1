drm/i915: do not expose a dysfunctional backlight interface to userspace

Previously intel_panel_setup_backlight() would create a sysfs backlight
interface with max brightness of 1 if it was unable to figure out the max
backlight brightness. This rendered the backlight interface useless.

Do not create a dysfunctional backlight interface to begin with.
