pmac_zilog,kdb: Fix console poll hook to return instead of loop

kdb <-> kgdb transitioning does not work properly with this UART
driver because the get character routine loops indefinitely as opposed
to returning NO_POLL_CHAR per the expectation of the KDB I/O driver
API.

The symptom is a kernel hang when trying to switch debug modes.
