ath6kl: Fix race in aggregation reorder logic

There are many places where tid data are accessed without
the lock (rxtid->lock), this can lead to a race condition
when the timeout handler for aggregatin reorder and the
receive function are getting executed at the same time.
Fix this race, but still there are races which can not
be fixed without rewriting the whole aggregation reorder
logic, for now fix the obvious ones.
