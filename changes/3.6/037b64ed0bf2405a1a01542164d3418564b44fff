rcu: Place pointer to call_rcu() in rcu_data structure

This is a preparatory commit for increasing rcu_barrier()'s concurrency.
It adds a pointer in the rcu_data structure to the corresponding call_rcu()
function.  This allows a pointer to the rcu_data structure to imply the
function pointer, which allows _rcu_barrier() state to be placed in the
rcu_state structure.
