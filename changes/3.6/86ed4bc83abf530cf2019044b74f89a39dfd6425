ACPICA: Add support for multiple notify handlers

This change adds support to allow multiple notify handlers on
Device, ThermalZone, and Processor objects. Also re-worked
and restructured the entire notify support code for handler
installation, handler removal, notify event queuing, and notify
dispatch to handler.

Extends and updates original commit 3f0be67("ACPI / ACPICA: Multiple
system notify handlers per device") by Rafael Wysocki.
