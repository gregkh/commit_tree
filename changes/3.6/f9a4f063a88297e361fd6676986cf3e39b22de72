iommu/tegra: Don't call alloc_pdir with as->lock

Instead of taking as->lock before calling alloc_pdir() and
releasing it in that function to allocate memory, just take
the lock only in the alloc_pdir function and run the loop
without any lock held. This simplifies the complicated
lock->unlock->alloc->lock->unlock sequence into
alloc->lock->unlock.
