kbuild: add symbol prefix arg to kallsyms

Commit 1f2bfbd00e466ff3489b2ca5cc75b1cccd14c123 ("kbuild: link of
vmlinux moved to a script") introduced in v3.5-rc1 broke kallsyms on
architectures which have symbol prefixes.

The --symbol-prefix argument used to be added to the KALLSYMS command
line from the architecture Makefile, however this isn't picked up by the
new scripts/link-vmlinux.sh. This resulted in symbols like
kallsyms_addresses being added which weren't correctly overriding the
weak symbols such as _kallsyms_addresses. These could then trigger
BUG_ONs in kallsyms code.

This is fixed by removing the KALLSYMS addition from the architecture
Makefile, and using CONFIG_SYMBOL_PREFIX in the link-vmlinux.sh script
to determine whether to add the --symbol-prefix argument.
