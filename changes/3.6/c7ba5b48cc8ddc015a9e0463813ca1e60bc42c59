KVM: MMU: fast path of handling guest page fault

If the the present bit of page fault error code is set, it indicates
the shadow page is populated on all levels, it means what we do is
only modify the access bit which can be done out of mmu-lock

Currently, in order to simplify the code, we only fix the page fault
caused by write-protect on the fast path
