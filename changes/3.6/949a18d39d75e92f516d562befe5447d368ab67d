staging: comedi: adl_pci6208: remove thisboard and devpriv macros

The 'thisboard' and 'devpriv' macros rely on a local variable having
a specific name and yield pointers derived from that local variable.
Replace the macros with local variables where used. Use the
comedi_board() helper to get the 'thisboard' pointer.
