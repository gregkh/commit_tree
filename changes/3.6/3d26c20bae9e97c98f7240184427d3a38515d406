Platform: OLPC: allow EC cmd to be overridden, and create a workqueue to call it

This provides a new API allows different OLPC architectures to override the
EC driver.  x86 and ARM OLPC machines use completely different EC backends.

The olpc_ec_cmd is synchronous, and waits for the workqueue to send the
command to the EC.  Multiple callers can run olpc_ec_cmd() at once, and
they will by serialized and sleep while only one executes on the EC at a time.

We don't provide an unregister function, as that doesn't make sense within
the context of OLPC machines - there's only ever 1 EC, it's critical to
functionality, and it certainly not hotpluggable.
