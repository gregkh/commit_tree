drm/i915: ensure HDMI port is disabled inside set_infoframes

This function is supposed to be used at mode set time, so prevent
against future mistakes by adding a WARN().

Based on a patch by Paulo Zanoni, with the check extracted into a
little assert_hdmi_port_disabled helper added to make things self
documenting and move the assert stuff out of line.

[fixed up spelling goof-up while applying.]
