dma: tegra: fix residual calculation for cyclic case

In cyclic mode of DMA, the byte transferred can be more
than the requested size and in this case, calculating
residuals based on the current position of DMA transfer to
bytes requested i.e. bytes required to transfer to reach
bytes requested from current DMA position.
