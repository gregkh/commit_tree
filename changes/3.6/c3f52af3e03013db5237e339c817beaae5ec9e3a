NFS: Fix the initialisation of the readdir 'cookieverf' array

When the NFS_COOKIEVERF helper macro was converted into a static
inline function in commit 99fadcd764 (nfs: convert NFS_*(inode)
helpers to static inline), we broke the initialisation of the
readdir cookies, since that depended on doing a memset with an
argument of 'sizeof(NFS_COOKIEVERF(inode))' which therefore
changed from sizeof(be32 cookieverf[2]) to sizeof(be32 *).

At this point, NFS_COOKIEVERF seems to be more of an obfuscation
than a helper, so the best thing would be to just get rid of it.
