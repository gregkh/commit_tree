ath9k: fix aggregate size limit based on queue TXOP limit

If the aggregate size exceeds the TXOP limit, it leads to lots of unnecessary
hardware and software retries.

The previous 4ms frame limit table was completely undocumented, the commit
that updated it only vaguely referenced and equation from the standard,
but I've been unable to replicate its results.

Fix this by using a formula based on the code in ath_pkt_duration, which is
more likely to be correct for this case.
