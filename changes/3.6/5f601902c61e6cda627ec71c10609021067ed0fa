staging: zsmalloc: remove x86 dependency

This patch replaces the page table assisted object mapping
method, which has x86 dependencies, with a arch-independent
method that does a simple copy into a temporary per-cpu
buffer.

While a copy seems like it would be worse than mapping the pages,
tests demonstrate the copying is always faster and, in the case of
running inside a KVM guest, roughly 4x faster.
