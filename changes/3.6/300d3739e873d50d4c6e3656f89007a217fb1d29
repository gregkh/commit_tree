Revert "NMI watchdog: fix for lockup detector breakage on resume"

Revert commit 45226e9 (NMI watchdog: fix for lockup detector breakage
on resume) which breaks resume from system suspend on my SH7372
Mackerel board (by causing a NULL pointer dereference to happen) and
is generally wrong, because it abuses the CPU hotplug functionality
in a shamelessly blatant way.

The original issue should be addressed through appropriate syscore
resume callback instead.
