i2c-i801: Check and return errors during byte-by-byte transfers

If an error is detected in the polling loop, abort the transaction and
return an error code.

 * DEV_ERR is set if the device does not respond with an acknowledge, and
the SMBus controller times out (minimum 25ms).
 * BUS_ERR is set if a bus arbitration collision is detected.  In other
words, when the SMBus controller tries to generate a START condition, but
detects that the SMBDATA is being held low, usually by another SMBus/I2C
master.
 * FAILED is only set if a transaction is stopped by software (using
the SMBHSTCNT KILL bit).
