net-tcp: Fast Open client - sending SYN-data

This patch implements sending SYN-data in tcp_connect(). The data is
from tcp_sendmsg() with flag MSG_FASTOPEN (implemented in a later patch).

The length of the cookie in tcp_fastopen_req, init'd to 0, controls the
type of the SYN. If the cookie is not cached (len==0), the host sends
data-less SYN with Fast Open cookie request option to solicit a cookie
from the remote. If cookie is not available (len > 0), the host sends
a SYN-data with Fast Open cookie option. If cookie length is negative,
  the SYN will not include any Fast Open option (for fall back operations).

To deal with middleboxes that may drop SYN with data or experimental TCP
option, the SYN-data is only sent once. SYN retransmits do not include
data or Fast Open options. The connection will fall back to regular TCP
handshake.
