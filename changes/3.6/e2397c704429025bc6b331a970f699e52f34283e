target: Add generation of LOGICAL BLOCK ADDRESS OUT OF RANGE

Many SCSI commands are defined to return a CHECK CONDITION / ILLEGAL
REQUEST with ASC set to LOGICAL BLOCK ADDRESS OUT OF RANGE if the
initiator sends a command that accesses a too-big LBA.  Add an enum
value and case entries so that target code can return this status.
