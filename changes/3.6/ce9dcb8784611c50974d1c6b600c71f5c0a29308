ARM: davinci: add runtime PM support for clock management

Add runtime PM core support to davinci by using the pm_clk
infrastructure of the PM core.

When runtime PM is enabled, the davinci runtime PM implementation will
use the pm_clk layer to enable/disable clocks on demand.  When runtime
PM is disabled, the pm_clk core will automatically enable clocks when
the driver is bound and disable clocks when the driver is unbound.
