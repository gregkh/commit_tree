ipv6: raw: fix icmpv6_filter()

icmpv6_filter() should not modify its input, or else its caller
would need to recompute ipv6_hdr() if skb->head is reallocated.

Use skb_header_pointer() instead of pskb_may_pull() and
change the prototype to make clear both sk and skb are const.

Also, if icmpv6 header cannot be found, do not deliver the packet,
as we do in IPv4.
