ipc: allow compat IPC version field parsing if !ARCH_WANT_OLD_COMPAT_IPC

Commit 48b25c43e6ee ("ipc: provide generic compat versions of IPC
syscalls") added a new ARCH_WANT_OLD_COMPAT_IPC config option for
architectures to select if their compat target requires the old IPC
syscall interface.

For architectures (such as AArch64) that do not require the internal
calling conventions provided by this option, but have a compat target
where the C library passes the IPC_64 flag explicitly,
compat_ipc_parse_version no longer strips out the flag before calling
the native system call implementation, resulting in unknown SHM/IPC
commands and -EINVAL being returned to userspace.

This patch separates the selection of the internal calling conventions
for the IPC syscalls from the version parsing, allowing architectures to
select __ARCH_WANT_COMPAT_IPC_PARSE_VERSION if they want to use version
parsing whilst retaining the newer syscall calling conventions.
