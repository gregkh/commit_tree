cfg80211: process pending events when unregistering net device

libertas currently calls cfg80211_disconnected() when it is being
brought down. This causes an event to be allocated, but since the
wdev is already removed from the rdev by the time that the event
processing work executes, the event is never processed or freed.

Fix this leak, and other possible situations, by processing the event
queue when a device is being unregistered. Thanks to Johannes Berg for
the suggestion.
