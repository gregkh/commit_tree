mm: CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE -> CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP

0ee332c14518699 ("memblock: Kill early_node_map[]") wanted to replace
CONFIG_ARCH_POPULATES_NODE_MAP with CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP but
ended up replacing one occurence with a reference to the non-existent
symbol CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE.

The resulting omission of code would probably have been causing problems
to 32-bit machines with memory hotplug.
