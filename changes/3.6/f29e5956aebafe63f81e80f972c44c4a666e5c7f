pstore: Add console log messages support

Pstore doesn't support logging kernel messages in run-time, it only
dumps dmesg when kernel oopses/panics. This makes pstore useless for
debugging hangs caused by HW issues or improper use of HW (e.g.
weird device inserted -> driver tried to write a reserved bits ->
SoC hanged. In that case we don't get any messages in the pstore.

Therefore, let's add a runtime logging support: PSTORE_TYPE_CONSOLE.
