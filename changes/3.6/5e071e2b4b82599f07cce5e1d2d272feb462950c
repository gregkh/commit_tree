sh: Fix up TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME sans TIF_SIGPENDING handling.

As Al notes, we missed a TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME check which caused any
handlers without TIF_SIGPENDING also set to skip the notification:

	Looks like while it is in the relevant masks *and* checked in
	do_notify_resume() both on 32bit and 64bit variants since commit
	ab99c733ae73cce31f2a2434f7099564e5a73d95 ("sh: Make syscall tracer
	use tracehook notifiers, add TIF_NOTIFY_RESUME.") they are
	actually *not* reached without simulataneous SIGPENDING, since
	the actual glue in the callers had not been updated back then and
	still checks for _TIF_SIGPENDING alone when deciding whether to
	hit do_notify_resume() or not.
