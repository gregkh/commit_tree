mfd: USB: Fix the omap-usb EHCI ULPI PHY reset fix issues.

'ARM: OMAP3: USB: Fix the EHCI ULPI PHY reset issue' (1fcb57d0) fixes
an issue where the ULPI PHYs were not held in reset while initializing
the EHCI controller. However, it also changes behavior in
omap-usb-host.c omap_usbhs_init by releasing reset while the
configuration in that function was done.

This change caused a regression on BB-xM where USB would not function
if 'usb start' had been run from u-boot before booting. A change was
made to release reset a little bit earlier which fixed the issue on
BB-xM and did not cause any regressions on 3430 sdp, the board for
which the fix was originally made.

This new fix, 'USB: EHCI: OMAP: Finish ehci omap phy reset cycle
before adding hcd.', (3aa2ae74) caused a regression on OMAP5.

The original fix to hold the EHCI controller in reset during
initialization was correct, however it appears that changing
omap_usbhs_init to not hold the PHYs in reset during it's
configuration was incorrect. This patch first reverts both fixes, and
then changes ehci_hcd_omap_probe in ehci-omap.c to hold the PHYs in
reset as the original patch had done. It also is sure to incorporate
the _cansleep change that has been made in the meantime.

I've tested this on Beagleboard xM, I'd really like to get an ack from
the 3430 sdp and OMAP5 guys before getting this merged.

v3 - Brown paper bag its too early in the morning actually run
     git commit amend fix
v2 - Put cansleep gpiolib call outside of spinlock
