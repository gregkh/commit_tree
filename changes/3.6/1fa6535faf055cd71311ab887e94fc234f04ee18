Bluetooth: Add support for Apple vendor-specific devices

As pointed out by Gustavo and Marcel, all Apple-specific Broadcom
devices seen so far have the same interface class, subclass and
protocol numbers. This patch adds an entry which matches all of them,
using the new USB_VENDOR_AND_INTERFACE_INFO() macro.

In particular, this patch adds support for the MacBook Pro Retina
(05ac:8286), which is not in the present list.
