dm persistent data: stop using dm_bm_unlock_move when shadowing blocks in tm

Stop using dm_bm_unlock_move when shadowing blocks in the transaction
manager as an optimisation and remove the function as it is then no
longer used.

Some code, such as the space maps, keeps using on-disk data structures
from the previous transaction.  It can do this because blocks won't
be reallocated until the subsequent transaction.  Using
dm_bm_unlock_move to copy blocks sounds like a win, but it forces a
synchronous read should the old block be accessed.
