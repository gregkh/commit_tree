powerpc: Fix usage of register macros getting ready for %r0 change

Anything that uses a constructed instruction (ie. from ppc-opcode.h),
need to use the new R0 macro, as %r0 is not going to work.

Also convert usages of macros where we are just determining an offset
(usually for a load/store), like:
	std	r14,STK_REG(r14)(r1)
Can't use STK_REG(r14) as %r14 doesn't work in the STK_REG macro since
it's just calculating an offset.
