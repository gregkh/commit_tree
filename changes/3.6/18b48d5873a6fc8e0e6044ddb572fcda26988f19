memory hotplug: reset pgdat->kswapd to NULL if creating kernel thread fails

If kthread_run() fails, pgdat->kswapd contains errno.  When we stop this
thread, we only check whether pgdat->kswapd is NULL and access it.  If
it contains errno, it will cause page fault.  Reset pgdat->kswapd to
NULL when creating kernel thread fails can avoid this problem.
