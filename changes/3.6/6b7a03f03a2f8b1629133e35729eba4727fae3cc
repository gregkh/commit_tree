xfs: handle EOF correctly in xfs_vm_writepage

We need to zero out part of a page which beyond EOF before setting uptodate,
otherwise, mapread or write will see non-zero data beyond EOF.

Based on the code in fs/buffer.c and the following ext4 commit:

  ext4: handle EOF correctly in ext4_bio_write_page()

And yes, I wish we had a good test case for it.
