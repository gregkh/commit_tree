ARM: OMAP3: PM: cpuidle: optimize the PER latency in C1 state

One of the main contributors of the low power code latency is
the PER power domain. To optimize the high-performance and
low-latency C1 state, prevent any PER state which is lower
than the CORE state in C1.

Reported and suggested by Kevin Hilman.
