[media] media: reorganize the main Kconfig items

Change the main items to:

<m> Multimedia support  --->
   [ ]   Cameras/video grabbers support
   [ ]   Analog TV support
   [ ]   Digital TV support
   [ ]   AM/FM radio receivers/transmitters support
   [ ]   Remote Controller support

This provides an interface that is clearer to end users that
are compiling the Kernel, and will allow the building system
to automatically unselect drivers for unused functions.
