ftrace: Disable function tracing during suspend/resume and hibernation, again

If function tracing is enabled for some of the low-level suspend/resume
functions, it leads to triple fault during resume from suspend, ultimately
ending up in a reboot instead of a resume (or a total refusal to come out
of suspended state, on some machines).

This issue was explained in more detail in commit f42ac38c59e0a03d (ftrace:
disable tracing for suspend to ram). However, the changes made by that commit
got reverted by commit cbe2f5a6e84eebb (tracing: allow tracing of
suspend/resume & hibernation code again). So, unfortunately since things are
not yet robust enough to allow tracing of low-level suspend/resume functions,
suspend/resume is still broken when ftrace is enabled.

So fix this by disabling function tracing during suspend/resume & hibernation.
