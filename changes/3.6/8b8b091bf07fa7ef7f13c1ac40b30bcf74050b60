pinctrl: Add one-register-per-pin type device tree based pinctrl driver

Add one-register-per-pin type device tree based pinctrl driver.

This driver has been tested on omap2+ series of processors,
where there is either an 8 or 16-bit padconf register for each pin.
Support for other similar pinmux controllers can be added.
