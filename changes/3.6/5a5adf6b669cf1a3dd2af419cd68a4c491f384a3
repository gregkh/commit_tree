[media] v4l2-dev/ioctl.c: add vb2_queue support to video_device

This prepares struct video_device for easier integration with vb2.

It also introduces a new lock that protects the vb2_queue. It is up
to the driver to use it or not. And the driver can associate an owner
filehandle with the queue to check whether queuing requests are
permitted for the calling filehandle.
