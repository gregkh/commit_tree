locks: fix checking of fcntl_setlease argument

The only checks of the long argument passed to fcntl(fd,F_SETLEASE,.)
are done after converting the long to an int.  Thus some illegal values
may be let through and cause problems in later code.

[ They actually *don't* cause problems in mainline, as of Dave Jones's
  commit 8d657eb3b438 "Remove easily user-triggerable BUG from
  generic_setlease", but we should fix this anyway.  And this patch will
  be necessary to fix real bugs on earlier kernels. ]
