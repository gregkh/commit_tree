mmc: sdhci: if MAX_CURRENT is 0, try getting current from regulator

The sd host controller spec indicates the the MAX_CURRENT value may
be returned as 0.  In this case other methods need to be used to
return the current.  If 0 is returned and there is a regulator,
ask the regulator for how much current is available.
