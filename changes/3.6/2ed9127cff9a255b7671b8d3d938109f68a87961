usb: musb: host: Disable MUSB DMA mode incase of DMA channel request failure

Currently in case of MUSB DMA channel request failure we are not
clearing MUSB_RXCSR_DMAENAB, MUSB_RXCSR_H_AUTOREQ and
MUSB_RXCSR_AUTOCLEAR bits of MUSB RXCSR of MUSB DMA. Which is
causing failure in receipt of data packets in next transfer.

Fix is to disable the MUSB DMA mode and related bits incase of
DMA channel request fails
