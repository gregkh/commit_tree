leds: Rename led_brightness_set() to led_set_brightness()

Rename leds external interface led_brightness_set() to led_set_brightness().
This is the second phase of the change to reduce confusion between the
leds internal and external interfaces that set brightness. With this change,
now the external interface is led_set_brightness(). The first phase renamed
the internal interface led_set_brightness() to __led_set_brightness().
There are no changes to the interface implementations.
