PCI/PM: Fix config reg access for D3cold and bridge suspending

This patch fixes the following bug:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-pci&m=134338059022620&w=2

Where lspci does not work properly if a device and the corresponding
parent bridge (such as PCIe port) is suspended.  This is because the
device configuration space registers will be not accessible if the
corresponding parent bridge is suspended or the device is put into
D3cold state.

To solve the issue, the bridge/PCIe port connected to the device is
put into active state before read/write configuration space registers.
If the device is in D3cold state, it will be put into active state
too.

To avoid resume/suspend PCIe port for each configuration register
read/write, a small delay is added before the PCIe port to go
suspended.
