wlcore/wl12xx: add support for HP and SKW FEM radio manufacturers

Add support for HP (High Performance TQS fem type 3) and SKW
(fem type 2). This is done by increasing the number of FEM
manufacturers to 4.

Usually FEM parameters from ini file are read from nvs file and
passed to firmware using TEST_CMD_INI_FILE_RADIO_PARAM. Still,
because the nvs file has only place for 2 FEMs, we need to pass the
new FEM types information in one of the available entries.

This is done by mapping new fem types 2,3 to entry 0. This solution
works for manual FEM selection. AutoDetect-FEM still support only
fem types 0 and 1.
