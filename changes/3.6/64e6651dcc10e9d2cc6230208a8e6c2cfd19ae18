eCryptfs: Call lower ->flush() from ecryptfs_flush()

Since eCryptfs only calls fput() on the lower file in
ecryptfs_release(), eCryptfs should call the lower filesystem's
->flush() from ecryptfs_flush().

If the lower filesystem implements ->flush(), then eCryptfs should try
to flush out any dirty pages prior to calling the lower ->flush(). If
the lower filesystem does not implement ->flush(), then eCryptfs has no
need to do anything in ecryptfs_flush() since dirty pages are now
written out to the lower filesystem in ecryptfs_release().
