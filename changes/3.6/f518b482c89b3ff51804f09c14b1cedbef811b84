i2c: omap: Correct I2C revision for OMAP3

The OMAP3530 is based upon the same silicon as the OMAP3430 and so the I2C
revision is the same for 3430 and 3530. However, the OMAP3630 device has the
same I2C revision as OMAP4. Correct the revision definition to reflect this.

This patch is based on work done by Jon Hunter <jon-hunter@ti.com>
Changes from his patch
- Update OMAP_I2C_REV_ON_3430 also to reflect that it is same as 3530
