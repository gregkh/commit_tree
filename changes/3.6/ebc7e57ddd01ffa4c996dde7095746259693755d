wlcore/wl18xx: enable MIMO/wide-chan rates in AP-mode rate config

Add a HW op to add extra enabled rates for AP-mode data-rates. Since
the rates might depend on channel properties, reconfigure AP-mode rates
when these change.

Implement the HW op for the 18xx family, where MIMO or wide-chan rates
can be added.
