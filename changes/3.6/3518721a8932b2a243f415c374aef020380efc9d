Smack: user access check bounds

Some of the bounds checking used on the /smack/access
interface was lost when support for long labels was
added. No kernel access checks are affected, however
this is a case where /smack/access could be used
incorrectly and fail to detect the error. This patch
reintroduces the original checks.

Targeted for git://git.gitorious.org/smack-next/kernel.git
