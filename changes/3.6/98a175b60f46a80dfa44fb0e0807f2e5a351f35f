regulator: core: Add regulator_set_voltage_time_sel to calculate ramp delay.

This patch adds regulator_set_voltage_time_sel(), to move into core, the
commonly used code by drivers to provide the .set_voltage_time_sel callback.
It will also allow us to configure different ramp delay for different
regulators easily.
