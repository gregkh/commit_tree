iommu/tegra: remove invalid reference to list iterator variable

If list_for_each_entry, etc complete a traversal of the
list, the iterator variable ends up pointing to an address
at an offset from the list head, and not a meaningful
structure.  Thus this value should not be used after the end
of the iterator.  Replace c->dev by dev, which is the value
that c->dev has been compared to.

This problem was found using Coccinelle (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/).
