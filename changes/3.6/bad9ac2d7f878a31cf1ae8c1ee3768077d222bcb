perf/x86/ibs: Check syscall attribute flags

Current implementation simply ignores attribute flags. Thus, there is
no notification to userland of unsupported features. Check syscall's
attribute flags to let userland know if a feature is supported by the
kernel. This is also needed to distinguish between future kernels what
might support a feature.
