Revert "Input: atmel_mxt_ts - warn if sysfs could not be created"

Dmitry: I understand that I am a bit late to the party :) but I do not
agree with this change. Failure to create attributes is not sometihng
that user could cause (at least not easily) and thus would not be a
setup issue but something more severe. I believe we should fail
loading the driver so sysfs attribute breakage will be noticed as soon
as possible, instead of discovering it much much later in the process.

This reverts commit 639900380062ecd78ee8b265ea23929c565469b4.
