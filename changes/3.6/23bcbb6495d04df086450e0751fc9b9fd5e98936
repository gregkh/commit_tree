staging: comedi: pcl812: remove PCL812_EXTDEBUG define and related code

The PCL812_EXTDEBUG define enables a bunch of function tracing debug
messages as well as a dump of the comedi_cmd info during the cmdtest.
There are better ways to do the function tracing and the cmdtest
dump shouldn't be in the driver. Just remove all of it.
