ARM: 7484/1: Don't enable GENERIC_LOCKBREAK with ticket spinlocks

Now that ARM has implemented its spinlocks with tickets we don't
need to use the generic lockbreak algorithm. Remove the Kconfig
from ARM so that we use the arch_spin_is_contended() definition
from the asm header. This also saves a word in each lock because
we don't need the break_lock member anymore.
