CIFS: Extend credit mechanism to process request type

Split all requests to echos, oplocks and others - each group uses
its own credit slot. This is indicated by new flags

CIFS_ECHO_OP and CIFS_OBREAK_OP

that are not used now for CIFS. This change is required to support
SMB2 protocol because of different processing of these commands.
