edac: Move grain/dtype/edac_type calculus to be out of channel loop

The 3e7bddc changeset (edac: move dimm properties to struct memset_info)
moved the calculus inside a loop. However, at those stuff are common to
all channels, on several drivers, it is better to put the calculus
outside the loop, to optimize the code.
