ext4: make quota as first class supported feature

This patch adds support for quotas as a first class feature in ext4;
which is to say, the quota files are stored in hidden inodes as file
system metadata, instead of as separate files visible in the file system
directory hierarchy.

It is based on the proposal at:

This patch introduces a new feature - EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_QUOTA
which, when turned on, enables quota accounting at mount time
iteself. Also, the quota inodes are stored in two additional superblock
fields.  Some changes introduced by this patch that should be pointed
out are:

1) Two new ext4-superblock fields - s_usr_quota_inum and
   s_grp_quota_inum for storing the quota inodes in use.
2) Default quota inodes are: inode#3 for tracking userquota and inode#4
   for tracking group quota. The superblock fields can be set to use
   other inodes as well.
3) If the QUOTA feature and corresponding quota inodes are set in
   superblock, the quota usage tracking is turned on at mount time. On
   'quotaon' ioctl, the quota limits enforcement is turned
   on. 'quotaoff' ioctl turns off only the limits enforcement in this
   case.
4) When QUOTA feature is in use, the quota mount options 'quota',
   'usrquota', 'grpquota' are ignored by the kernel.
5) mke2fs or tune2fs can be used to set the QUOTA feature and initialize
   quota inodes. The default reserved inodes will not be visible to user
   as regular files.
6) The quota-tools will need to be modified to support hidden quota
   files on ext4. E2fsprogs will also include support for creating and
   fixing quota files.
7) Support is only for the new V2 quota file format.
