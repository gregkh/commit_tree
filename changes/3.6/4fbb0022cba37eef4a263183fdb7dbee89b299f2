gpio: of_get_named_gpio_flags() return -EPROBE_DEFER if GPIO not yet available

of_get_named_gpio_flags() and of_get_named_gpio() return -EPROBE_DEFER if the
respective GPIO is not (yet) available. This is useful if driver's probe()
functions try to get a GPIO whose controller isn't probed yet. Thus, the driver
can be probed again later on.

The function still returns -EINVAL on other errors (parse error or node doesn't
exist). This way, the case of an optional/intentionally missing GPIO is handled
appropriately.
