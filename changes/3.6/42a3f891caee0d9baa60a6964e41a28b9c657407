ARM i.MX25: Make timer irq work again

Since i.MX has SPARSE_IRQ enabled the i.MX25 timer is broken. This
is because the internal irqs now start at an offset of NR_IRQS_LEGACY.
The patch fixed this up, but missed the i.MX25 timer which used a
hardcoded value instead of a define. This patch introduces a define
for the timer irq and uses it.

This is broken since introduced with 3.6-rc1:
