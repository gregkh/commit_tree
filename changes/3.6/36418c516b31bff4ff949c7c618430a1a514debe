ARM: 7499/1: mm: Fix vmalloc overlap check for !HIGHMEM

With !HIGHMEM, sanity_check_meminfo checks for banks that completely or
partially overlap the vmalloc region. The test for partial overlap checks
__va(bank->start + bank->size) > vmalloc_min. This is not appropriate if
there is a non-linear translation between virtual and physical addresses,
as bank->start + bank->size is actually in the bank following the one being
interrogated.

In most cases, even when using SPARSEMEM, this is not problematic as the
subsequent bank will start at a higher va than the one in question. However
if the physical to virtual address conversion is not monotonic increasing,
the incorrect test could result in a bank not being truncated when it
should be.

This patch ensures we perform the va-pa conversion on memory from the
bank we are interested in, not the following one.
