ARM: OMAP4: CPUidle: Open broadcast clock-event device.

OMAP4 idle driver uses CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_[ENTER/EXIT]
for broadcast clock events. But _ENTER/_EXIT doesn't really open
broadcast clock events and to explicitly setup the broadcast device,
CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_ON should be used.

Add the missing CLOCK_EVT_NOTIFY_BROADCAST_ON clockevent notifications.
This will setup the broadcast timer in either periodic/oneshot modes
correctly. Recent clockevent infrastructure change 77b0d60 {leave the
broadcast device in shutdown mode when not needed} exposed this bug
leading to boot hangs in oneshot mode. Prior to this, periodic broadcast
mode was also broken. This change fixes both the periodic/oneshot broadcast
modes.
