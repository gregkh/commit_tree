i7core_edac: change the mem allocation scheme to make Documentation/kobject.txt happy

Kernel kobjects have rigid rules: each container object should be
dynamically allocated, and can't be allocated into a single kmalloc.

EDAC never obeyed this rule: it has a single malloc function that
allocates all needed data into a single kzalloc.

As this is not accepted anymore, change the allocation schema of the
EDAC *_info structs to enforce this Kernel standard.
