task_work: add a scheduling point in task_work_run()

It seems commit 4a9d4b02 (switch fput to task_work_add) reintroduced
the problem addressed in commit 944be0b2 (close_files(): add scheduling
point)

If a server process with a lot of files (say 2 million tcp sockets)
is killed, we can spend a lot of time in task_work_run() and trigger
a soft lockup.
