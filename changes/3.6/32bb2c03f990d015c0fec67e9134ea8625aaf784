wlcore/wl12xx/wl18xx: handle spare blocks spacial cases per arch

Add a HW op for getting spare blocks.

12xx cards require 2 spare blocks for GEM encrypted SKBs, regardless
of VIFs or keys programmed into the FW.

18xx cards require 2 spare blocks when there are any connected TKIP or
GEM VIFs. For now always return 2 spare blocks, as this works with all
networks. The special case TKIP/GEM functionality is added at a later
patch.
