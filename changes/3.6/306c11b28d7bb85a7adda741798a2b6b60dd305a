target: go through normal processing for zero-length PSCSI commands

Right now, commands with a zero-size payload are skipped completely.
This is wrong; such commands should be passed down to the device and
processed normally.

For physical backends, this ignores completely things such as START
STOP UNIT.  For virtual backends, we have a hack in place to clear a
unit attention state on a zero-size REQUEST SENSE, but we still do
not report errors properly on zero-length commands---out-of-bounds
0-block reads and writes, too small parameter list lengths, etc.

This patch fixes this for PSCSI.  Uses of transport_kmap_data_sg are
guarded with a check for non-zero cmd->data_length; for all other
commands a zero length is handled properly in pscsi_execute_cmd.
The sole exception will be for now REPORT LUNS, which is handled
through the normal SPC emulation.
