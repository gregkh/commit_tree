target: simply fabric driver queue full processing

There is no need to schedule the delayed processing in a workqueue that
offloads it to the target processing thread.  Instead execute it directly
from the workqueue.  There will be a lot of future work in this area,
which I'd likfe to defer for now as it is not nessecary for getting rid
of the target processing thread.
