ARM: 7474/1: get rid of TIF_SYSCALL_RESTARTSYS

just let do_work_pending() return 1 on normal local restarts and
-1 on those that had been caused by ERESTART_RESTARTBLOCK (and 0
is still "all done, sod off to userland now").  And let the asm
glue flip scno to restart_syscall(2) one if it got negative from
us...
