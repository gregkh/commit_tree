staging: zsmalloc: Finish conversion to a separate module

ZSMALLOC is tristate, but the code has no MODULE_LICENSE and since it
depends on GPL-only symbols it cannot be loaded as a module.  This in
turn breaks zram which now depends on it.  I assume it's meant to be
Dual BSD/GPL like the other z-stuff.

There is also no module_exit, which will make it impossible to unload.
Add the appropriate module_init and module_exit declarations suggested
by comments.
