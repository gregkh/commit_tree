rcu: Introduce for_each_rcu_flavor() and use it

The arrival of TREE_PREEMPT_RCU some years back included some ugly
code involving either #ifdef or #ifdef'ed wrapper functions to iterate
over all non-SRCU flavors of RCU.  This commit therefore introduces
a for_each_rcu_flavor() iterator over the rcu_state structures for each
flavor of RCU to clean up a bit of the ugliness.
