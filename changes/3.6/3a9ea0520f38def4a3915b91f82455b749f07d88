uprobes: Introduce find_active_uprobe() helper

No functional changes. Move the "find uprobe" code from
handle_swbp() to the new helper, find_active_uprobe().

Note: with or without this change, the find-active-uprobe logic
is not exactly right. We can race with another thread which
unmaps the memory with the valid uprobe before we take
mm->mmap_sem. We can't find this uprobe simply because
find_vma() fails. In this case we wrongly assume that this trap
was not caused by uprobe and send the erroneous SIGTRAP. See the
next changes.
