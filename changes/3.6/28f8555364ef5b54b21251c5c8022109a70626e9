rcu: The rcu_needs_cpu() function is not a quiescent state

The TINY_PREEMPT_RCU() function rcu_preempt_needs_cpu(), which is called
from rcu_needs_cpu(), assumes that it is in a quiescent state with respect
to the CPU.  This is no longer the case.  This commit therefore updates
rcu_preempt_needs_cpu() to make it aware that it is not running in a
quiescent state.
