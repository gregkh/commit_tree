rbd: return errors for mapped but deleted snapshot

When a snapshot is deleted, the OSD will return ENOENT when reading
from it. This is normally interpreted as a hole by rbd, which will
return zeroes. To minimize the time in which this can happen, stop
requests early when we are notified that our snapshot no longer
exists.
