acpi/video_detect: blacklist samsung x360

On Samsung X360, the BIOS will set a flag (VDRV) if the generic
ACPI backlight device is used. This flag will definitively break
the backlight interface (even the vendor interface) untill next
reboot. It's why we should prevent video.ko from being used here
and we can't rely on a later call to acpi_video_unregister().
