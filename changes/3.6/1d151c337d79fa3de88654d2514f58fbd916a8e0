c/r: fcntl: add F_GETOWNER_UIDS option

When we restore file descriptors we would like them to look exactly as
they were at dumping time.

With help of fcntl it's almost possible, the missing snippet is file
owners UIDs.

To be able to read their values the F_GETOWNER_UIDS is introduced.

This option is valid iif CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE is turned on, otherwise
returning -EINVAL.
