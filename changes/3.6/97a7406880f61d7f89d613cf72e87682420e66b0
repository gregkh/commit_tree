ext4: remove useless marking of superblock dirty

Commit a0375156 properly notes that superblock doesn't need to be marked
as dirty when only number of free inodes / blocks / number of directories
changes since that is recomputed on each mount anyway. However that comment
leaves some unnecessary markings as dirty in place. Remove these.

Artem: tested using xfstests for both journalled and non-journalled ext4.
