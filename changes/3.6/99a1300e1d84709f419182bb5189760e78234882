thp: avoid VM_BUG_ON page_count(page) false positives in __collapse_huge_page_copy

Speculative cache pagecache lookups can elevate the refcount from
under us, so avoid the false positive. If the refcount is < 2 we'll be
notified by a VM_BUG_ON in put_page_testzero as there are two
put_page(src_page) in a row before returning from this function.
