[media] i2c: Export an unlocked flavor of i2c_transfer

Some drivers (in particular for TV cards) need exclusive access to
their I2C buses for specific operations. Export an unlocked flavor
of i2c_transfer to give them full control.

The unlocked flavor has the following limitations:
* Obviously, caller must hold the i2c adapter lock.
* No debug messages are logged. We don't want to log messages while
  holding a rt_mutex.
* No check is done on the existence of adap->algo->master_xfer. It
  is thus the caller's responsibility to ensure that the function is
  OK to call.
