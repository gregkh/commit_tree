ipv4: Cache ip_error() routes even when not forwarding.

And account for the fact that, when we are not forwarding, we should
bump statistic counters rather than emit an ICMP response.

RP-filter rejected lookups are still not cached.

Since -EHOSTUNREACH and -ENETUNREACH can now no longer be seen in
ip_rcv_finish(), remove those checks.
