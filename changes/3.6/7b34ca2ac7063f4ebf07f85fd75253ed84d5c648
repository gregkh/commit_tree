inet: Avoid potential NULL peer dereference.

We handle NULL in rt{,6}_set_peer but then our caller will try to pass
that NULL pointer into inet_putpeer() which isn't ready for it.

Fix this by moving the NULL check one level up, and then remove the
now unnecessary NULL check from inetpeer_ptr_set_peer().
