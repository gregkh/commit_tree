I2C: OMAP: make omap_i2c_unidle/idle functions depend on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME

The functions omap_i2c_unidle/idle are called from omap_i2c_runtime_resume
and omap_i2c_runtime_suspend which is compiled for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME.
This patch removes the omap_i2c_unidle/idle functions and folds them
into the runtime callbacks.

This fixes the below warn when CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is not defined
