ipv4: Cache output routes in fib_info nexthops.

If we have an output route that lacks nexthop exceptions, we can cache
it in the FIB info nexthop.

Such routes will have DST_HOST cleared because such routes refer to a
family of destinations, rather than just one.

The sequence of the handling of exceptions during route lookup is
adjusted to make the logic work properly.

Before we allocate the route, we lookup the exception.

Then we know if we will cache this route or not, and therefore whether
DST_HOST should be set on the allocated route.

Then we use DST_HOST to key off whether we should store the resulting
route, during rt_set_nexthop(), in the FIB nexthop cache.
