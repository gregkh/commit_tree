Btrfs: join tree mod log code with the code holding back delayed refs

We've got two mechanisms both required for reliable backref resolving (tree
mod log and holding back delayed refs). You cannot make use of one without
the other. So instead of requiring the user of this mechanism to setup both
correctly, we join them into a single interface.

Additionally, we stop inserting non-blockers into fs_info->tree_mod_seq_list
as we did before, which was of no value.
