libceph: embed ceph messenger structure in ceph_client

A ceph client has a pointer to a ceph messenger structure in it.
There is always exactly one ceph messenger for a ceph client, so
there is no need to allocate it separate from the ceph client
structure.

Switch the ceph_client structure to embed its ceph_messenger
structure.
