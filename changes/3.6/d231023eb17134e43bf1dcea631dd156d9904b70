bnx2x: link cleanup

This patch does several things:
 1. Add static to function when possible.
 2. Correct comments.
 3. Change msleep(small) --> usleep_range(small, small*2).
    Also correct existing calls to usleep_range.
 4. Remove dead code.
 5. Change 'if(rc != 0)' --> if(rc)

Most of these changes are purely semantic.
