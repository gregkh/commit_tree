UBIFS: fix complaints about too small debug buffer size

When debugging is enabled, we use a temporary on-stack buffer for formatting
the key strings like "(11368871, direntry, 0xcd0750)". The buffer size is
32 bytes and sometimes it is not enough to fit the key string - e.g., when
inode numbers are high. This is not fatal, but the key strings are incomplete
and UBIFS complains like this:

	UBIFS assert failed in dbg_snprintf_key at 137 (pid 1)

This is a regression caused by "515315a UBIFS: fix key printing".

Fix the issue by increasing the buffer to 48 bytes.
