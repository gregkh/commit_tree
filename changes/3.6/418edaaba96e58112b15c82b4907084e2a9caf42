RDMA/ucma.c: Fix for events with wrong context on iWARP

It is possible for asynchronous RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED events to be
generated with ctx->uid == 0, because ucma_set_event_context() copies
ctx->uid to the event structure outside of ctx->file->mut.  This leads
to a crash in the userspace library, since it gets a bogus event.

Fix this by taking the mutex a bit earlier in ucma_event_handler.
