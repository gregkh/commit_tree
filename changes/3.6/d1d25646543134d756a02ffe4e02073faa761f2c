rbd: use reference counting for the snap context

This prevents a race between requests with a given snap context and
header updates that free it. The osd client was already expecting the
snap context to be reference counted, since it get()s it in
ceph_osdc_build_request and put()s it when the request completes.

Also remove the second down_read()/up_read() on header_rwsem in
rbd_do_request, which wasn't actually preventing this race or
protecting any other data.
