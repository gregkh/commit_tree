i2c: Fall back to emulated SMBus if the operation isn't supported natively

Adapter drivers might support only a subset of the SMBus operations
natively. Those drivers currently have to manually emulate unsupported
operations using I2C.

Make the i2c_smbus_xfer() function fall back to
i2c_smbus_xfer_emulated() when the adapter's .smbus_xfer() operation
returns -EOPNOTSUPP, like it already does when the .smbus_xfer()
operation isn't available at all.

[JD: Minor optimization.]
