NFS: Add version registering framework

This patch adds in the code to track multiple versions of the NFS
protocol.  I created default structures for v2, v3 and v4 so that each
version can continue to work while I convert them into kernel modules.
I also removed the const parameter from the rpc_version array so that I
can change it at runtime.
