Fix unexpected SA hard expiration after changing date

After SA is setup, one timer is armed to detect soft/hard expiration,
however the timer handler uses xtime to do the math. This makes hard
expiration occurs first before soft expiration after setting new date
with big interval. As a result new child SA is deleted before rekeying
the new one.
