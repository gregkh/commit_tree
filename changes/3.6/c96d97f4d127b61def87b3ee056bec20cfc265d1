net/mlx4: Set steering mode according to device capabilities

Instead of checking the firmware supported steering mode in various
places in the code, add a dedicated field in the mlx4 device capabilities
structure which is written once during the initialization flow and read
across the code.

This also set the grounds for add new steering modes. Currently two modes
are supported, and are named after the ConnectX HW versions A0 and B0.

A0 steering uses mac_index, vlan_index and priority to steer traffic
into pre-defined range of QPs.

B0 steering uses Ethernet L2 hashing rules and is enabled only
if the firmware supports both unicast and multicast B0 steering,

The current steering modes are relevant for Ethernet traffic only,
such that Infiniband steering remains untouched.
