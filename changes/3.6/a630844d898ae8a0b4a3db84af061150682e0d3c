net/stmmac: Use clk_prepare_enable and clk_disable_unprepare

This patch fixes an issue introduced by commit ID 6a81c26f
[net/stmmac: remove conditional compilation of clk code], which
switched from the internal stmmac_clk_{en}{dis}able calls to
clk_{en}{dis}able. By this, calling clk_prepare and clk_unprepare
was removed.

clk_{un}prepare is mandatory for platforms using common clock framework.
Since these drivers are used by SPEAr platform, which supports common
clock framework, add clk_{un}prepare() support for them. Otherwise
the clocks are not correctly en-/disabled and ethernet support doesn't
work.
