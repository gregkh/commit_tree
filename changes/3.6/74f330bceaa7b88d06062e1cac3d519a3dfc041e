mmc: sdhci-esdhc: break out early if clock is 0

Since commit 30832ab56 ("mmc: sdhci: Always pass clock request value
zero to set_clock host op") was merged, esdhc_set_clock starts hitting
"if (clock == 0)" where ESDHC_SYSTEM_CONTROL has been operated.  This
causes SDHCI card-detection function being broken.  Fix the regression
by moving "if (clock == 0)" above ESDHC_SYSTEM_CONTROL operation.
