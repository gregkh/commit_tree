clk: wm831x: Add initial WM831x clock driver

The WM831x and WM832x series of PMICs contain a flexible clocking
subsystem intended to provide always on and system core clocks.  It
features:

- A 32.768kHz crystal oscillator which can optionally be used to pass
  through an externally generated clock.
- A FLL which can be clocked from either the 32.768kHz oscillator or
  the CLKIN pin.
- A CLKOUT pin which can bring out either the oscillator or the FLL
  output.
- The 32.768kHz clock can also optionally be brought out on the GPIO
  pins of the device.

This driver fully supports the 32.768kHz oscillator and CLKOUT.  The FLL
is supported only in AUTO mode, the full flexibility of the FLL cannot
currently be used.

Due to a lack of access to systems where the core SoC has been converted
to use the generic clock API this driver has been compile tested only.
