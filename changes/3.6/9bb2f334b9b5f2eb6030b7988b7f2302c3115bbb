rbd: create pool_id device attribute

Add an entry under /sys/bus/rbd/devices/<N>/ named "pool_id" that
provides the id for the pool the rbd image is assocatied with.  This
is in addition to the pool name already provided.

Rename the "poolid" field in struct rbd_device  to be "pool_id".

Update the documentation to reflect the addition of this new entry.
