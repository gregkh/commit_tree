drm/radeon: add an exclusive lock for GPU reset v2

GPU reset need to be exclusive, one happening at a time. For this
add a rw semaphore so that any path that trigger GPU activities
have to take the semaphore as a reader thus allowing concurency.

The GPU reset path take the semaphore as a writer ensuring that
no concurrent reset take place.

v2: init rw semaphore
