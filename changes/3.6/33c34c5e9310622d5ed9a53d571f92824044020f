6lowpan: rework fragment-deleting routine

6lowpan module starts collecting incomming frames and fragments
right after lowpan_module_init() therefor it will be better to
clean unfinished fragments in lowpan_cleanup_module() function
instead of doing it when link goes down.

Changed spinlocks type to prevent deadlock with expired timer event
and removed unused one.
