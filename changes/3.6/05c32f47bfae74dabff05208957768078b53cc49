dlm: fix race between remove and lookup

It was possible for a remove message on an old
rsb to be sent after a lookup message on a new
rsb, where the rsbs were for the same resource
name.  This could lead to a missing directory
entry for the new rsb.

It is fixed by keeping a copy of the resource
name being removed until after the remove has
been sent.  A lookup checks if this in-progress
remove matches the name it is looking up.
