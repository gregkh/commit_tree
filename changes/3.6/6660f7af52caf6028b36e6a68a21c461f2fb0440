dma: tegra: do not set transfer desc flag to DMA_CTRL_ACK in cyclic mode

The sound dmaengine pcm driver uses the dma in cyclic mode and
it does not ack the transfer descriptor  after transfer stops.
This may lead to hold that desc in chip's dma driver and does
not allow to reuse/free that descriptors. Hence not enabling
flag DMA_CTRL_ACK when dma runs in cyclic mode.
