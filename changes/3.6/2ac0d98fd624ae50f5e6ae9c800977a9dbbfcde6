nohz: Make nohz API agnostic against idle ticks cputime accounting

When the timer tick fires, it accounts the new jiffy as either part
of system, user or idle time. This is how we record the cputime
statistics.

But when the tick is stopped from the idle task, we still need
to record the number of jiffies spent tickless until we restart
the tick and fall back to traditional tick-based cputime accounting.

To do this, we take a snapshot of jiffies when the tick is stopped
and compute the difference against the new value of jiffies when
the tick is restarted. Then we account this whole difference to
the idle cputime.

However we are preparing to be able to stop the tick from other places
than idle. So this idle time accounting needs to be performed from
the callers of nohz APIs, not from the nohz APIs themselves because
we now want them to be agnostic against places that stop/restart tick.

Therefore, we pull the tickless idle time accounting out of generic
nohz helpers up to idle entry/exit callers.
