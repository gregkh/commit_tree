pwm: pwm-tiehrpwm: Fix conflicting channel period setting

EHRPWM hardware supports 2 independent PWM channels. However the device
uses only one register to handle period setting for both channels. So
both channels should be configured for same period (in nsec).

Fix the same by returning error for conflicting period values.

However, allow
1. Configuration of period settings if not conflicting with other
channels
2. Re-configuring of period settings if no other channels being
configured
