NFS: Clear key construction data if the idmap upcall fails

idmap_pipe_downcall already clears this field if the upcall succeeds,
but if it fails (rpc.idmapd isn't running) the field will still be set
on the next call triggering a BUG_ON().  This patch tries to handle all
possible ways that the upcall could fail and clear the idmap key data
for each one.
