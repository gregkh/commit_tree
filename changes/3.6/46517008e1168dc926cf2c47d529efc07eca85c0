ipv4: Kill ip_rt_frag_needed().

There is zero point to this function.

It's only real substance is to perform an extremely outdated BSD4.2
ICMP check, which we can safely remove.  If you really have a MTU
limited link being routed by a BSD4.2 derived system, here's a nickel
go buy yourself a real router.

The other actions of ip_rt_frag_needed(), checking and conditionally
updating the peer, are done by the per-protocol handlers of the ICMP
event.

TCP, UDP, et al. have a handler which will receive this event and
transmit it back into the associated route via dst_ops->update_pmtu().

This simplification is important, because it eliminates the one place
where we do not have a proper route context in which to make an
inetpeer lookup.
