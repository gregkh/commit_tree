drm/sis: fixup sis_mm ioctl structs

Userspace uses long in quite a few places more than the kernel. Which
gives me neat proof that I'm the only guy on this side of the galaxy
who ever tried to run glxgears on a 64bit machine with sis graphics on
linux.

Note that the longs in drm_sis_mem_t aren't aligned properly, so this
won't even work with 32bit userspace on 64bit kernel as-is. Hence the
patch can't break that, either.

Nope, I'm not nuts enough to write the 32bit ioctl compat layer for
this and test it with some wine app. Even though hunting the ebay
dungeons for a sis card actually supported by the mesa drivers casts
some doubts on this ...
