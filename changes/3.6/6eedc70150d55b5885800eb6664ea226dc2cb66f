vfs: Move noop_backing_dev_info check from sync into writeback

In principle, a filesystem may want to have ->sync_fs() called during sync(1)
although it does not have a bdi (i.e. s_bdi is set to noop_backing_dev_info).
Only writeback code really needs bdi set to something reasonable. So move the
checks where they are more logical.
