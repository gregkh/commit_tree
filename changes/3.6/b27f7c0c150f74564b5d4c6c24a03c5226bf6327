btrfs: join DEV_STATS ioctls to one

Commit c11d2c236cc260b36 (Btrfs: add ioctl to get and reset the device
stats) introduced two ioctls doing almost the same thing distinguished
by just the ioctl number which encodes "do reset after read". I have
suggested

to implement it via the ioctl args. This hasn't happen, and I think we
should use a more clean way to pass flags and should not waste ioctl
numbers.
