ARM: 7502/1: contextidr: avoid using bfi instruction during notifier

The bfi instruction is not available on ARMv6, so instead use an and/orr
sequence in the contextidr_notifier. This gets rid of the assembler
error:

  Assembler messages:
  Error: selected processor does not support ARM mode `bfi r3,r2,#0,#8'
