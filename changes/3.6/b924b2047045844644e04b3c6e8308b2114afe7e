ARM: OMAP: Make FS USB omap1 only

As the FS USB code is not being actively used for omap2+
there's no point keeping it around for omap2+.

Let's make the FS USB platform init code omap1 only so
we can remove the last user of omap_read/write for omap2+,
and simplify things for further USB, DMA, and device tree
related work.

While at it, also group the mach includes for the related
drivers.
