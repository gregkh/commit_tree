mknod: take sanity checks on mode into the very beginning

Note that applying umask can't affect their results.  While
that affects errno in cases like
	mknod("/no_such_directory/a", 030000)
yielding -EINVAL (due to impossible mode_t) instead of
-ENOENT (due to inexistent directory), IMO that makes a lot
more sense, POSIX allows to return either and any software
that relies on getting -ENOENT instead of -EINVAL in that
case deserves everything it gets.
