brcmfmac: fix race condition for rx and tx data.

On both rx and tx there is was a race condition on the queueing
of usb requests. When for example frame gets submitted it is
possible that complete function gets called even before
usb_submit_urb() returns. As a result it is possible that usb
requests get losts, which was noticed on OMAP4 pandaboard
platform. This patch fixes the race condition.
