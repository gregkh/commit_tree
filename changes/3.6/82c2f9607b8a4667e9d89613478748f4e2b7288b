crypto: caam - ERA retrieval and printing for SEC device

This patch adds support for retrieving and printing of
SEC ERA information. It is useful for knowing beforehand
what features exist from the SEC point of view on a
certain SoC. Only era-s 1 to 4 are currently supported;
other eras will appear as unknown.
