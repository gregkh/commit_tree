staging:iio:trigger: Use to_iio_trigger() instead of dev_get_drvdata()

Use to_iio_trigger(dev) instead of dev_get_drvdata(dev). Both will return the
trigger which belongs to the device, but the the first on is a bit more
lightweight. Also this will eventually free up the drvdata pointer of the device
for driver specific data.
