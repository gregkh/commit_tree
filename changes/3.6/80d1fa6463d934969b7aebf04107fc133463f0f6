cpusets, hotplug: Implement cpuset tree traversal in a helper function

At present, the functions that deal with cpusets during CPU/Mem hotplug
are quite messy, since a lot of the functionality is mixed up without clear
separation. And this takes a toll on optimization as well. For example,
the function cpuset_update_active_cpus() is called on both CPU offline and CPU
online events; and it invokes scan_for_empty_cpusets(), which makes sense
only for CPU offline events. And hence, the current code ends up unnecessarily
traversing the cpuset tree during CPU online also.

As a first step towards cleaning up those functions, encapsulate the cpuset
tree traversal in a helper function, so as to facilitate upcoming changes.
