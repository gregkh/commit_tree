rtc: pl031: fix up IRQ flags

The pl031 interrupt is shared between the timer part and the clockwatch
part of the same HW block on the ux500, so mark it IRQF_SHARED on this
variant.

This patch also adds the IRQF_NO_SUSPEND flag to the rtc irq on all
variants as we don't want this pretty important IRQ to be disabled in
suspend.
