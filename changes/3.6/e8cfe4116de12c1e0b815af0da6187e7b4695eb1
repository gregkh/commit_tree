staging: tidspbridge: split bridge_io_on_loaded

Due to its size, this function declares too many variables,
to split it a new structure has been declared to hold values
as they are read from the baseimage.

While at it, indentation was reduced by renaming variables
and reducing blocks of code with the following structure:

if (success) {
    ...
    if (success)
        ...
}

This fixes the following warning:
drivers/staging/tidspbridge/core/io_sm.c:
	In function 'bridge_io_on_loaded':
drivers/staging/tidspbridge/core/io_sm.c:777:
	warning: the frame size of 1032 bytes is larger
	than 1024 bytes
