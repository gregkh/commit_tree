[SCSI] hpsa: fix handling of protocol error

If a command status of CMD_PROTOCOL_ERR is received, this
information should be conveyed to the SCSI mid layer, not
dropped on the floor.  CMD_PROTOCOL_ERR may be received
from the Smart Array for any commands destined for an external
RAID controller such as a P2000, or commands destined for tape
drives or CD/DVD-ROM drives, if for instance a cable is
disconnected.  This mostly affects multipath configurations, as
disconnecting a cable on a non-multipath configuration is not
going to do anything good regardless of whether CMD_PROTOCOL_ERR
is handled correctly or not.  Not handling CMD_PROTOCOL_ERR
correctly in a multipath configaration involving external RAID
controllers may cause data corruption, so this is quite a serious
bug.  This bug should not normally cause a problem for direct
attached disk storage.
