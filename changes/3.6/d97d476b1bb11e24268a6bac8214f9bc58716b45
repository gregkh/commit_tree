slab: Fix a typo in commit 8c138b "slab: Get rid of obj_size macro"

Commit  8c138b only sits in Pekka's and linux-next tree now, which tries
to replace obj_size(cachep) with cachep->object_size, but has a typo in
kmem_cache_free() by using "size" instead of "object_size", which casues
some regressions.
