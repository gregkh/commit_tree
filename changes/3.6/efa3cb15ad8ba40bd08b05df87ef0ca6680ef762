i2c-i801: Refactor use of LAST_BYTE in i801_block_transaction_byte_by_byte

As a slight optimization, pull some logic out of the polling loop during
byte-by-byte transactions by just setting the I801_LAST_BYTE bit, as
defined in the i801 (PCH) datasheet, when reading the last byte of a
byte-by-byte I2C_SMBUS_READ.
