dmaengine: PL08x: fix tx_status function to return correct residue

Now that we're converted to use the generic vchan support, we can fix
the residue return from tx_status to be compliant with dmaengine.  This
returns the number of bytes remaining for the _specified_ cookie, not
the number of bytes in all pending transfers on the channel.
