sparc32: drop fixmap.h

sparc32 does not support fixmaps - so do not pretend so by
having the fixmap.h file.
Move relevant parts to vaddrs.h.

I looked at simplifying this even more but failed to understand
the reasoning behind the extra guard page involved and due to
missing testing possibilities only the trivial conversion was done.
