x86, cpu, amd: Fix crash as Xen Dom0 on AMD Trinity systems

f7f286a910221 ("x86/amd: Re-enable CPU topology extensions in case BIOS
has disabled it") wrongfully added code which used the AMD-specific
{rd,wr}msr variants for no real reason.

This caused boot panics on xen which wasn't initializing the
{rd,wr}msr_safe_regs pv_ops members properly.

This, in turn, caused a heated discussion leading to us reviewing all
uses of the AMD-specific variants and removing them where unneeded
(almost everywhere except an obscure K8 BIOS fix, see 6b0f43ddfa358).

Finally, this patch switches to the standard {rd,wr}msr*_safe* variants
which should've been used in the first place anyway and avoided unneeded
excitation with xen.
