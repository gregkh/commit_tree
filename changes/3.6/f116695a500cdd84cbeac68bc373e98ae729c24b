mm: frontswap: split out __frontswap_unuse_pages

An attempt at making frontswap_shrink shorter and more readable. This patch
splits out walking through the swap list to find an entry with enough
pages to unuse.

Also, assert that the internal __frontswap_unuse_pages is called under swap
lock, since that part of code was previously directly happen inside the lock.
