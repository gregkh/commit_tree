mm: cma: fix alignment requirements for contiguous regions

Contiguous Memory Allocator requires each of its regions to be aligned
in such a way that it is possible to change migration type for all
pageblocks holding it and then isolate page of largest possible order from
the buddy allocator (which is MAX_ORDER-1). This patch relaxes alignment
requirements by one order, because MAX_ORDER alignment is not really
needed.
