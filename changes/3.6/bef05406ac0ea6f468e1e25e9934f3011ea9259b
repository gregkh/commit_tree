bnx2x: Avoid sending multiple statistics queries

During traffic when DCB is enabled, it is possible for multiple instances
of statistics queries to be sent to the chip - this may cause the FW to assert.

This patch prevents the sending of an additional instance of statistics query
while the previous query hasn't completed.
