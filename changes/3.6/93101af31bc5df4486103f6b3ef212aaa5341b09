HID: usbhid: inline some simple routines

This patch (as1594) simplifies the usbhid driver by inlining a couple
of routines.  As a result of an earlier patch, irq_out_pump_restart()
and ctrl_pump_restart() are each used in only one place.  Since they
don't really do what their names say, and since they each involve only
about two lines of actual code, there's no reason to keep them as
separate functions.
