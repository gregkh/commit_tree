staging: comedi: cb_pcidio: cleanup "find pci device" code

Add a couple local variables to make the tests more concise.
Reorder the tests to make the for() loop checking for a
matching boardtype quicker.

Drop the dev_dbg for a match. It's just add noise.
Reword the dev_err when no match is found.
