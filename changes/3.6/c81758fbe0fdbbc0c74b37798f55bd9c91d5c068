mm/compaction.c: fix deferring compaction mistake

Commit aff622495c9a ("vmscan: only defer compaction for failed order and
higher") fixed bad deferring policy but made mistake about checking
compact_order_failed in __compact_pgdat().  So it can't update
compact_order_failed with the new order.  This ends up preventing
correct operation of policy deferral.  This patch fixes it.
