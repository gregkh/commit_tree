vfio: Add PCI device driver

Add PCI device support for VFIO.  PCI devices expose regions
for accessing config space, I/O port space, and MMIO areas
of the device.  PCI config access is virtualized in the kernel,
allowing us to ensure the integrity of the system, by preventing
various accesses while reducing duplicate support across various
userspace drivers.  I/O port supports read/write access while
MMIO also supports mmap of sufficiently sized regions.  Support
for INTx, MSI, and MSI-X interrupts are provided using eventfds to
userspace.
