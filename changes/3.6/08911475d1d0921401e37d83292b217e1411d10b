netfilter: nf_conntrack: generalize nf_ct_l4proto_net

This patch generalizes nf_ct_l4proto_net by splitting it into chunks and
moving the corresponding protocol part to where it really belongs to.

To clarify, note that we follow two different approaches to support per-net
depending if it's built-in or run-time loadable protocol tracker.
