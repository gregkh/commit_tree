USB: CDC ACM: Fix NULL pointer dereference

If a device specifies zero endpoints in its interface descriptor,
the kernel oopses in acm_probe(). Even though that's clearly an
invalid descriptor, we should test wether we have all endpoints.
This is especially bad as this oops can be triggered by just
plugging a USB device in.
