sparc64: Be less verbose during vmemmap population.

On a 2-node machine with 256GB of ram we get 512 lines of
console output, which is just too much.

This mimicks Yinghai Lu's x86 commit c2b91e2eec9678dbda274e906cc32ea8f711da3b
(x86_64/mm: check and print vmemmap allocation continuous) except that
we aren't ever going to get contiguous block pointers in between calls
so just print when the virtual address or node changes.

This decreases the output by an order of 16.

Also demote this to KERN_DEBUG.
