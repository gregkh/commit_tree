Redefine ATOMIC_INIT and ATOMIC64_INIT to drop the casts

The following build error occurred during an alpha build:

  net/core/sock.c:274:36: error: initializer element is not constant

Dave Anglin says:
> Here is the line in sock.i:
>
> struct static_key memalloc_socks = ((struct static_key) { .enabled =
> ((atomic_t) { (0) }) });

The above line contains two compound literals.  It also uses a designated
initializer to initialize the field enabled.  A compound literal is not a
constant expression.

The location of the above statement isn't fully clear, but if a compound
literal occurs outside the body of a function, the initializer list must
consist of constant expressions.
