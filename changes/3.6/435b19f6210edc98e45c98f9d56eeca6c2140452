ixgbe: Update configure virtualization to allow for multiple PF pools

This change allows all pools from the default pool forward to be enabled vi
ixgbe_configure_virtualization.  This is needed as we are planning to use
queues belonging to adjacent pools for FCoE when SR-IOV and FCoE are both
enabled.

In addition this patch contains some minor formatting changes as there were
a few spots that seemed to be in need of some cleanup.
