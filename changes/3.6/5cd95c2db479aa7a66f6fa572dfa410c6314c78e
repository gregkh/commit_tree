perf kvm: Set name for VM process in guest machine

COMM events are not generated in the context of a guest machine, so the
thread name is never set for the VMM process. For example, the qemu-kvm
name applies to the process in the host machine, not the guest machine.
So, samples for guest machines are currently displayed as:

    99.67%     :5671  [unknown]         [g] 0xffffffff81366b41

where 5671 is the pid of the VMM. With this patch the samples in the guest
machine are shown as:

    18.43%  [guest/5671]  [unknown]           [g] 0xffffffff810d68b7
