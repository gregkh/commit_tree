KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix incorrect branch in H_CEDE code

In handling the H_CEDE hypercall, if this vcpu has already been
prodded (with the H_PROD hypercall, which Linux guests don't in fact
use), we branch to a numeric label '1f'.  Unfortunately there is
another '1:' label before the one that we want to jump to.  This fixes
the problem by using a textual label, 'kvm_cede_prodded'.  It also
changes the label for another longish branch from '2:' to
'kvm_cede_exit' to avoid a possible future problem if code modifications
add another numeric '2:' label in between.
