rcu: Make __call_rcu() handle invocation from idle

Although __call_rcu() is handled correctly when called from a momentary
non-idle period, if it is called on a CPU that RCU believes to be idle
on RCU_FAST_NO_HZ kernels, the callback might be indefinitely postponed.
This commit therefore ensures that RCU is aware of the new callback and
has a chance to force the CPU out of dyntick-idle mode when a new callback
is posted.
