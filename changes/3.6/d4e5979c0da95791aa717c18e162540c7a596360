ath9k: Add PID/VID support for AR1111

AR1111 is same as AR9485. The h/w
difference between them is quite insignificant,
Felix suggests only very few baseband features
may not be available in AR1111. The h/w code for
AR9485 is already present, so AR1111 should
work fine with the addition of its PID/VID.
