NFSv4.1 mark layout when already returned

When the file layout driver is fencing a DS, _pnfs_return_layout can be
called mulitple times per inode due to in-flight i/o referencing lsegs on it's
plh_segs list.

Remember that LAYOUTRETURN has been called, and do not call it again.
Allow LAYOUTRETURNs after a subsequent LAYOUTGET.
