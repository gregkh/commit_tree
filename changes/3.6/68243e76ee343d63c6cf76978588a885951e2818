mm: account for the number of times direct reclaimers get throttled

Under significant pressure when writing back to network-backed storage,
direct reclaimers may get throttled.  This is expected to be a short-lived
event and the processes get woken up again but processes do get stalled.
This patch counts how many times such stalling occurs.  It's up to the
administrator whether to reduce these stalls by increasing
min_free_kbytes.
