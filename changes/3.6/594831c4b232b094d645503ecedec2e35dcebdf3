Btrfs: fix potential race in extent buffer freeing

This sounds sort of impossible but it is the only thing I can think of and
at the very least it is theoretically possible so here it goes.

If we are in try_release_extent_buffer we will check that the ref count on
the extent buffer is 1 and not under IO, and then go down and clear the tree
ref.  If between this check and clearing the tree ref somebody else comes in
and grabs a ref on the eb and the marks it dirty before
try_release_extent_buffer() does it's tree ref clear we can end up with a
dirty eb that will be freed while it is still dirty which will result in a
panic.  Thanks,
