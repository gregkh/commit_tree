ath9k: do not sampling on ani timer when chip is in sleep

The baseband and cycle counters are being sampled during ani
processing for debugging purpose. Whenever the ani is postponded
due to sleep state, taking samples on that time is of no use and
also unneccesarily waking up the chip might increase the power
consumption on idle associated state. Hence moving debug function
within powersave block.
