Revert "[media] radio: Add Sanyo LM7000 tuner driver"

This reverts commit 4ecbb69414c61af3594209e081d6e834ea68a16d.

As requested by Hans Verkuil:
> You accidentally merged the wrong first version of the lm7000 patch series.
>
> These are the correct second version patches:
>
> http://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/11689/
> http://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/11690/
> http://patchwork.linuxtv.org/patch/11691/
>
> The second version is much simpler and doesn't require the creation of a whole
> new driver.
