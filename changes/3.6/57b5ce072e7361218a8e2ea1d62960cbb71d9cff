cfg80211: add cellular base station regulatory hint support

Cellular base stations can provide hints to cfg80211 about
where they think we are. This can be done for example on
a cell phone. To enable these hints we simply allow them
through as user regulatory hints but we allow userspace
to clasify the hint as either coming directly from the
user or coming from a cellular base station. This option
is only available when you enable
CONFIG_CFG80211_CERTIFICATION_ONUS.

The base station hints themselves will not be processed
by the core unless at least one device on the system
supports this feature.
