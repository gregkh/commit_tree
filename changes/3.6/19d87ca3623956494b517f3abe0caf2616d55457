NFS: Split out remaining NFS v4 inode functions

Somehow I missed this in my previous patch series, but these functions
are only needed by the v4 code and should be moved to a v4-only file.  I
wasn't exactly sure where I should put these functions, so I moved them
into nfs4super.c where I could make them static.
