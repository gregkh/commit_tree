libceph: move init of bio_iter

If a message has a non-null bio pointer, its bio_iter field is
initialized in write_partial_msg_pages() if this has not been done
already.  This is really a one-time setup operation for sending a
message's (bio) data, so move that initialization code into
prepare_write_message_data() which serves that purpose.
