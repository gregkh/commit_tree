uprobes: Teach build_probe_list() to consider the range

Currently build_probe_list() builds the list of all uprobes
attached to the given inode, and the caller should filter out
those who don't fall into the [start,end) range, this is
sub-optimal.

This patch turns find_least_offset_node() into
find_node_in_range() which returns the first node inside the
[min,max] range, and changes build_probe_list() to use this node
as a starting point for rb_prev() and rb_next() to find all
other nodes the caller needs. The resulting list is no longer
sorted but we do not care.

This can speed up both build_probe_list() and the callers, but
there is another reason to introduce find_node_in_range(). It
can be used to figure out whether the given vma has uprobes or
not, this will be needed soon.

While at it, shift INIT_LIST_HEAD(tmp_list) into
build_probe_list().
