dm thin: reduce endio_hook pool size

Reduce the slab size used for the dm_thin_endio_hook mempool.

Allocation has been seen to fail on machines with smaller amounts

  lvm: page allocation failure. order:5, mode:0xd0
  device-mapper: table: 253:38: thin-pool: Error creating pool's endio_hook mempool
