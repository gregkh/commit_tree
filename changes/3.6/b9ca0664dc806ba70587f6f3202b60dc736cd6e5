Btrfs: do not set subvolume flags in readonly mode

$ mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb7
$ btrfstune -S1 /dev/sdb7
$ mount /dev/sdb7 /mnt/btrfs
mount: block device /dev/sdb7 is write-protected, mounting read-only
$ btrfs dev add /dev/sdb8 /mnt/btrfs/

Now we get a btrfs in which mnt flags has readonly but sb flags does
not.  So for those ioctls that only check sb flags with MS_RDONLY, it
is going to be a problem.
Setting subvolume flags is such an ioctl, we should use mnt_want_write_file()
to check RO flags.
