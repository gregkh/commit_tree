vfio: Fix virqfd release race

vfoi-pci supports a mechanism like KVM's irqfd for unmasking an
interrupt through an eventfd.  There are two ways to shutdown this
interface: 1) close the eventfd, 2) ioctl (such as disabling the
interrupt).  Both of these do the release through a workqueue,
which can result in a segfault if two jobs get queued for the same
virqfd.

Fix this by protecting the pointer to these virqfds by a spinlock.
The vfio pci device will therefore no longer have a reference to it
once the release job is queued under lock.  On the ioctl side, we
still flush the workqueue to ensure that any outstanding releases
are completed.
