MD RAID1: rename mirror_info structure

MD RAID1: Rename the structure 'mirror_info' to 'raid1_info'

The same structure name ('mirror_info') is used by raid10.  Each of these
structures are defined in there respective header files.  If dm-raid is
to support both RAID1 and RAID10, the header files will be included and
the structure names must not collide.  While only one of these structure
names needs to change, this patch adds consistency to the naming of the
structure.
