staging: comedi: Move COMEDI_NI_LABPC config option

Move the CONFIG_COMEDI_NI_LABPC option ("NI Lab-PC and compatibles ISA
and PCI support") from the CONFIG_COMEDI_NI_COMMON menu ("Comedi
National Instruments card support  --->") to the
CONFIG_COMEDI_PCI_DRIVERS menu ("Comedi PCI drivers  --->").

It currently depends on PCI but should be split up into separate ISA and
PCI config options eventually as was done for the "das08" driver.  For
now, the PCI card menu seems the best place for it and I plan to get rid
of the CONFIG_COMEDI_NI_COMMON menu altogether.
