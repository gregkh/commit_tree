checkpatch: add control statement test to SINGLE_STATEMENT_DO_WHILE_MACRO

Commit b13edf7ff2dd ("checkpatch: add checks for do {} while (0) macro
misuses") added a test that is overly simplistic for single statement
macros.

Macros that start with control tests should be enclosed in a do {} while
(0) loop.

Add the necessary control tests to the check.
