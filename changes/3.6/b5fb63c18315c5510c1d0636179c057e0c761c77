fs: add nd_jump_link

Add a helper that abstracts out the jump to an already parsed struct path
from ->follow_link operation from procfs.  Not only does this clean up
the code by moving the two sides of this game into a single helper, but
it also prepares for making struct nameidata private to namei.c
