ASoC: dmaengine-pcm: Add support for querying stream position from DMA driver

Currently the sound dmaengine pcm helper functions implement the pcm_pointer
callback by trying to count the number of elapsed periods. This is done by
advancing the stream position in the dmaengine callback by one period.
Unfortunately there is no guarantee that the callback will be called for each
elapsed period. It may be possible that under high system load it is only called
once for multiple elapsed periods. This patch addresses the issue by
implementing support for querying the current stream position directly from the
dmaengine driver. Since not all dmaengine drivers support reporting the stream
position yet the old period counting implementation is kept for now.

Furthermore the new mechanism allows to report the stream position with a
sub-period granularity, given that the dmaengine driver supports this.
