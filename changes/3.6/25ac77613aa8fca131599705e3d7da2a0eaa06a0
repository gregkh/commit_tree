ACPI: intel_idle : break dependency between modules

When the system is booted with some cpus offline, the idle
driver is not initialized. When a cpu is set online, the
acpi code call the intel idle init function. Unfortunately
this code introduce a dependency between intel_idle and acpi.

This patch is intended to remove this dependency by using the
notifier of intel_idle. This patch has the benefit of
encapsulating the intel_idle driver and remove some exported
functions.
