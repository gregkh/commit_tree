ALSA: hda - give 3-pin jack the name "Headphone Mic Jack"

This 3-pin jack was labeled "Headphone Jack", but it could also be
used as a mic jack just by switching "Input Source". Therefore we need
to call the jack something else, to make sure PulseAudio can use the
speaker together with the external mic. (PulseAudio might mute the
speaker if it detects a headphone being plugged in.)
