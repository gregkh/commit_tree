powerpc: POWER7 optimised copy_page using VMX and enhanced prefetch

Implement a POWER7 optimised copy_page using VMX and enhanced
prefetch instructions. We use enhanced prefetch hints to prefetch
both the load and store side. We copy a cacheline at a time and
fall back to regular loads and stores if we are unable to use VMX
(eg we are in an interrupt).

The following microbenchmark was used to assess the impact of
the patch:

http://ozlabs.org/~anton/junkcode/page_fault_file.c

We test MAP_PRIVATE page faults across a 1GB file, 100 times:

# time ./page_fault_file -p -l 1G -i 100

Before: 22.25s
After:  18.89s

17% faster
