[SCSI] block: Fix blk_execute_rq_nowait() dead queue handling

If the queue is dead blk_execute_rq_nowait() doesn't invoke the done()
callback function. That will result in blk_execute_rq() being stuck
in wait_for_completion(). Avoid this by initializing rq->end_io to the
done() callback before we check the queue state. Also, make sure the
queue lock is held around the invocation of the done() callback. Found
this through source code review.
