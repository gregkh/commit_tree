uprobes: Rename vma_address() and make it return "unsigned long"

1. vma_address() returns loff_t, this looks confusing and this
   is unnecessary after the previous change. Make it return "ulong",
   all callers truncate the result anyway.

2. Its name conflicts with mm/rmap.c:vma_address(), rename it to
   offset_to_vaddr(), this matches vaddr_to_offset().
