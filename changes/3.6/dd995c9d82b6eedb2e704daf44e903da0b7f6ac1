i2c/i2c-pxa: remove conditional compilation of clk code

With addition of dummy clk_*() calls for non CONFIG_HAVE_CLK cases in
clk.h, there is no need to have clk code enclosed in #ifdef
CONFIG_HAVE_CLK, #endif macros.

pxa i2c also has these dummy macros defined locally.  Remove them as they
aren't required anymore.
