ARM: SAMSUNG: Use spin_lock_{irqsave,irqrestore} in clk_set_rate

The spinlock clocks_lock can be held during ISR, hence it is not safe to
hold that lock with disabling interrupts.

It fixes following potential deadlock.

=========================================================
[ INFO: possible irq lock inversion dependency detected ]
3.6.0-rc4+ #2 Not tainted
---------------------------------------------------------
swapper/0/1 just changed the state of lock:
 (&(&host->lock)->rlock){-.....}, at: [<c027fb0d>] sdhci_irq+0x15/0x564
but this lock took another, HARDIRQ-unsafe lock in the past:
 (clocks_lock){+.+...}

and interrupts could create inverse lock ordering between them.

other info that might help us debug this:
 Possible interrupt unsafe locking scenario:

       CPU0                    CPU1
       ----                    ----
  lock(clocks_lock);
                               local_irq_disable();
                               lock(&(&host->lock)->rlock);
                               lock(clocks_lock);
  <Interrupt>
    lock(&(&host->lock)->rlock);
