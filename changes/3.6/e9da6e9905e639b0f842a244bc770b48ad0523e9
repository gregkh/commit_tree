ARM: dma-mapping: remove custom consistent dma region

This patch changes dma-mapping subsystem to use generic vmalloc areas
for all consistent dma allocations. This increases the total size limit
of the consistent allocations and removes platform hacks and a lot of
duplicated code.

Atomic allocations are served from special pool preallocated on boot,
because vmalloc areas cannot be reliably created in atomic context.
