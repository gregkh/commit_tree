staging: comedi: daqboard2000: remove 'got_regions' from private data

The 'got_regions' variable in the private data is used as a flag
for the detach to know if the pci device has been enabled.

Typically the dev->iobase variable is used to indicate this in
all the other comedi drivers. Do the same here for consistancy.
