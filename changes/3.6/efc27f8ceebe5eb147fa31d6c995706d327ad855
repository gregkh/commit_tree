net: Remove 'unlikely' qualifier in skb_steal_sock()

With early demux enabled by default for TCP flows, there is high chance that
skb->sk will be non-null. 'unlikely()' was removed from __inet_lookup_skb() but
maybe it can be removed from skb_steal_sock() as well.

Note: skb_steal_sock() is also called by __inet6_lookup_skb() and
__udp4_lib_lookup_skb() but they are protected by their own 'unlikely' calls.
