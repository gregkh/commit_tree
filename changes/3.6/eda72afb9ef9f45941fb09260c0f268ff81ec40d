nfs: don't use intents for checking atomic open

is_atomic_open() is now only used by nfs4_lookup_revalidate() to check whether
it's okay to skip normal revalidation.

It does a racy check for mount read-onlyness and falls back to normal
revalidation if the open would fail.  This makes little sense now that this
function isn't used for determining whether to actually open the file or not.

The d_mountpoint() check still makes sense since it is an indication that we
might be following a mount and so open may not revalidate the dentry.
