mm/compaction: cleanup on compaction_deferred

When CONFIG_COMPACTION is enabled, compaction_deferred() tries to
recalculate the deferred limit again, which isn't necessary.

When CONFIG_COMPACTION is disabled, compaction_deferred() should return
"true" or "false" since it has "bool" for its return value.
