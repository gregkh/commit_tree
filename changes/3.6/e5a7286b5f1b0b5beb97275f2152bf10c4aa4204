x86, boot: Remove ancient, unconditionally #ifdef'd out dead code

Release v1.3.82 wrapped a few lines of code in an "#ifdef
SAFE_RESET_DISK_CONTROLLER" and "#endif" pair. Since
SAFE_RESET_DISK_CONTROLLER was never defined anywhere that was basically
a verbose "#ifdef 0" and "#endif" pair. These dead lines have been in
the tree for sixteen years but now the time has come to remove them.

I guess the main lesson here is that if you want your dead code in the
tree for a very long time you'd better be creative. A plain old "#ifdef
0" and "#endif" pair just doesn't cut it!
