xfs: wait for the write the superblock on unmount

v2: Add the xfs_buf_lock to xfs_quiesce_attr().
    Add explaination why xfs_buf_lock() is used to wait for write.

xfs_wait_buftarg() does not wait for the completion of the write of the
uncached superblock. This write can race with the shutdown of the log
and causes a panic if the write does not win the race.

During the log write, xfsaild_push() will lock the buffer and set the
XBF_ASYNC flag. Because the XBF_FLAG is set, complete() is not performed
on the buffer's iowait entry, we cannot call xfs_buf_iowait() to wait
for the write to complete. The buffer's lock is held until the write is
complete, so we can block on a xfs_buf_lock() request to be notified
that the write is complete.
