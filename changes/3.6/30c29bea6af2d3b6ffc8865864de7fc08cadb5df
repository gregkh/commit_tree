slab: do ClearSlabPfmemalloc() for all pages of slab

Right now, we call ClearSlabPfmemalloc() for first page of slab when we
clear SlabPfmemalloc flag.  This is fine for most swap-over-network use
cases as it is expected that order-0 pages are in use.  Unfortunately it
is possible that that __ac_put_obj() checks SlabPfmemalloc on a tail
page and while this is harmless, it is sloppy.  This patch ensures that
the head page is always used.

This problem was originally identified by Joonsoo Kim.
