[media] gspca_konica: Fix init sequence

The konica needs a freaking large time (circa 6.5 seconds) to "boot", and
does not want to be bothered while doing so, so sleep for 6 seconds, and
then query its status register at 100ms intervals until it becomes ready.

This removes the "reg_w err: -32" messages shown in dmesg whenever a
konica cam gets initialized, and also fixes the camera not working when
an app tries to use it directly after it has been plugged in and after
a suspend/resume cycle.
