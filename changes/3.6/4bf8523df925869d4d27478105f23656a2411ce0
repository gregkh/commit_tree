staging:iio:magnetometer:ak8975: remove 'mode' attribute

The raw data reading process (ak8975_read_axis) sets the
single measurement mode to take a sample and once the
conversion is completed the device enters into power-down
mode automatically, therefore there is no need to enable
a flag for this to happen.
