USB: EHCI: use hrtimer for async schedule

This patch (as1576) adds hrtimer support for managing ehci-hcd's
async schedule.  Just as with the earlier change to the periodic
schedule management, two new hrtimer events take care of everything.

One event polls at 1-ms intervals to see when the Asynchronous
Schedule Status (ASS) flag matches the Asynchronous Schedule Enable
(ASE) value; the schedule's state must not be changed until it does.
The other event delays for 15 ms after the async schedule becomes
empty before turning it off.

The new events replace a busy-wait poll and a kernel timer usage.
They also replace the rather illogical method currently used for
indicating the async schedule should be turned off: attempting to
unlink the dedicated QH at the head of the async list.
