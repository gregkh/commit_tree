ARM: OMAP2+: CLEANUP: Remove ARCH_OMAPx ifdef from struct dpll_data

There are certain fields inside 'struct dpll_data' which are
included under ARCH_OMAP3 and ARCH_OMAP4 option, which makes it
difficult to use it for new devices like, am33xx, ti81xx, etc...

So remove the ifdef completely, this will add few fields to the struct
unused, but it improves readability and maintainability of the code.
