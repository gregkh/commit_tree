HID: tpkbd: work even if the new Lenovo Keyboard driver is not configured

c1dcad2d32d0252e8a3023d20311b52a187ecda3 added a new driver configured by
HID_LENOVO_TPKBD but made the hid_have_special_driver entry non-optional which
lead to a recognized but non-working device if the new driver wasn't
configured (which is the correct default).
