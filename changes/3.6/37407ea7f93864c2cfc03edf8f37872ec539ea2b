Revert "sched: Improve scalability via 'CPU buddies', which withstand random perturbations"

This reverts commit 970e178985cadbca660feb02f4d2ee3a09f7fdda.

Nikolay Ulyanitsky reported thatthe 3.6-rc5 kernel has a 15-20%
performance drop on PostgreSQL 9.2 on his machine (running "pgbench").

Borislav Petkov was able to reproduce this, and bisected it to this
commit 970e178985ca ("sched: Improve scalability via 'CPU buddies' ...")
apparently because the new single-idle-buddy model simply doesn't find
idle CPU's to reschedule on aggressively enough.

Mike Galbraith suspects that it is likely due to the user-mode spinlocks
in PostgreSQL not reacting well to preemption, but we don't really know
the details - I'll just revert the commit for now.

There are hopefully other approaches to improve scheduler scalability
without it causing these kinds of downsides.
