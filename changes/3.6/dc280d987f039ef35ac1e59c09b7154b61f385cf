MD RAID10: rename mirror_info structure

MD RAID10: Rename the structure 'mirror_info' to 'raid10_info'

The same structure name ('mirror_info') is used by raid1.  Each of these
structures are defined in there respective header files.  If dm-raid is
to support both RAID1 and RAID10, the header files will be included and
the structure names must not collide.
