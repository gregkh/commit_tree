memcg: remove check for signal_pending() during rmdir()

After bf544fdc241da8 "memcg: move charges to root cgroup if
use_hierarchy=0 in mem_cgroup_move_hugetlb_parent()", no memory reclaim
will occur when removing a memory cgroup.  If -EINTR is returned here,
cgroup will show a warning.

We don't need to handle any user interruption signal.  Remove this.
