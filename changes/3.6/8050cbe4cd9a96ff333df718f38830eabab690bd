OMAPDSS: DISPC/APPLY: Use interlace info in manager timings for dispc_ovl_setup()

Currently the interlace parameter passed to dispc_ovl_setup() is configured by
checking the display type, and set to true if the display type is VENC.

This isn't correct as other panels can take interlaced content too. The
omap_video_timings struct in manager's private data contains the info whether
the panel is in interlaced mode or not.
