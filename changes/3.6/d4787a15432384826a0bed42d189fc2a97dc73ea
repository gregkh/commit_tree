6lowpan: Fix null pointer dereference in UDP uncompression function

When a UDP packet gets fragmented, a crash will occur at reassembly time.
This is because skb->transport_header is not set during earlier period of fragment reassembly.
As a consequence, call to udp_hdr() return NULL and uh (which is NULL) gets
dereferenced without much test.
