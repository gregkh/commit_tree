block: drop custom queue draining used by scsi_transport_{iscsi|fc}

iscsi_remove_host() uses bsg_remove_queue() which implements custom
queue draining.  fc_bsg_remove() open-codes mostly identical logic.

The draining logic isn't correct in that blk_stop_queue() doesn't
prevent new requests from being queued - it just stops processing, so
nothing prevents new requests to be queued after the logic determines
that the queue is drained.

blk_cleanup_queue() now implements proper queue draining and these
custom draining logics aren't necessary.  Drop them and use
bsg_unregister_queue() + blk_cleanup_queue() instead.
