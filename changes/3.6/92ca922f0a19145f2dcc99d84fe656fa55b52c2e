vmalloc: walk vmap_areas by sorted list instead of rb_next()

There's a walk by repeating rb_next to find a suitable hole.  Could be
simply replaced by walk on the sorted vmap_area_list.  More simpler and
efficient.

Mutation of the list and tree only happens in pair within
__insert_vmap_area and __free_vmap_area, under protection of
vmap_area_lock.  The patch code is also under vmap_area_lock, so the list
walk is safe, and consistent with the tree walk.

Tested on SMP by repeating batch of vmalloc anf vfree for random sizes and
rounds for hours.
