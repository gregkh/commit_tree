vfio: Type1 IOMMU implementation

This VFIO IOMMU backend is designed primarily for AMD-Vi and Intel
VT-d hardware, but is potentially usable by anything supporting
similar mapping functionality.  We arbitrarily call this a Type1
backend for lack of a better name.  This backend has no IOVA
or host memory mapping restrictions for the user and is optimized
for relatively static mappings.  Mapped areas are pinned into system
memory.
