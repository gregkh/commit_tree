kthread_worker: reorganize to prepare for flush_kthread_work() reimplementation

Make the following two non-functional changes.

* Separate out insert_kthread_work() from queue_kthread_work().

* Relocate struct kthread_flush_work and kthread_flush_work_fn()
  definitions above flush_kthread_work().

v2: Added lockdep_assert_held() in insert_kthread_work() as suggested
    by Andy Walls.
