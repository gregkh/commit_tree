NFC: Changed HCI cmd execution completion result to std linux errno

An HCI command can complete either from an HCI response
(with an HCI result) or as a consequence of any other system
error during processing. The completion therefore needs to take
a standard errno code. The HCI response will convert its result
to a standard errno before calling the completion.
