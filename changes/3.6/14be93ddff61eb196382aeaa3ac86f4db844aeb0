drm/i915 + agp/intel-gtt: prep work for direct setup

To be able to directly set up the intel-gtt code from drm/i915 and
avoid setting up the fake-agp driver we need to prepare a few things:
- pass both the bridge and gpu pci_dev to the probe function and add
  code to handle the gpu pdev both being present (for drm/i915) and
  not present (fake agp).
- add refcounting to the remove function so that unloading drm/i915
  doesn't kill the fake agp driver

v2: Fix up the cleanup and refcount, noticed by Jani Nikula.
