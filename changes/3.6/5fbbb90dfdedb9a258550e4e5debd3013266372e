cpuidle: Prevent null pointer dereference in cpuidle_coupled_cpu_notify

When a kernel is built to support multiple hardware types it's possible
that CONFIG_ARCH_NEEDS_CPU_IDLE_COUPLED is set but the hardware the
kernel is run on doesn't support cpuidle and therefore doesn't load a
driver for it. In this case, when the system is shut down,
cpuidle_coupled_cpu_notify() gets called with cpuidle_devices set to
NULL. There are quite possibly other circumstances where this
situation can also occur and we should check for it.
