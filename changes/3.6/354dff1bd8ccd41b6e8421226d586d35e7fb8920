IB/qib: Fix UC MR refs for immediate operations

An MR reference leak exists when handling UC RDMA writes with
immediate data because we manipulate the reference counts as if the
operation had been a send.

This patch moves the last_imm label so that the RDMA write operations
with immediate data converge at the cq building code.  The copy/mr
deref code is now done correctly prior to the branch to last_imm.
