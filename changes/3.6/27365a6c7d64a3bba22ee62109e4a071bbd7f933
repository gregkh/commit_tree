Thermal: Add Hysteresis attributes

The Linux Thermal Framework does not support hysteresis
attributes. Most thermal sensors, today, have a
hysteresis value associated with trip points.

This patch adds hysteresis attributes on a per-trip-point
basis, to the Thermal Framework. These attributes are
optionally writable.
