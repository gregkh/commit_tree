simplify lookup_open()/atomic_open() - do the temporary mnt_want_write() early

The write ref to vfsmount taken in lookup_open()/atomic_open() is going to
be dropped; we take the one to stay in dentry_open().  Just grab the temporary
in caller if it looks like we are going to need it (create/truncate/writable open)
and pass (by value) "has it succeeded" flag.  Instead of doing mnt_want_write()
inside, check that flag and treat "false" as "mnt_want_write() has just failed".
mnt_want_write() is cheap and the things get considerably simpler and more robust
that way - we get it and drop it in the same function, to start with, rather
than passing a "has something in the guts of really scary functions taken it"
back to caller.
