x86, reboot: Drop redundant write of reboot_mode

We write reboot_mode to BIOS location 0x472 in
native_machine_emergency_restart() (reboot.c:542) already, there is no
need to then write it again in machine_real_restart().

This means nothing gets written there for MRR_APM, but the APM call is
a poweroff call and doesn't use this memory location.
