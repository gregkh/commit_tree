vfs: Reorder operations during sys_sync

Change the order of operations during sync from

for_each_sb {
        writeback_inodes_sb();
        sync_fs(nowait);
        __sync_blockdev(nowait);
}
for_each_sb {
        sync_inodes_sb();
        sync_fs(wait);
        __sync_blockdev(wait);
}

to

for_each_sb
        writeback_inodes_sb();
for_each_sb
        sync_fs(nowait);
for_each_sb
        __sync_blockdev(nowait);
for_each_sb
        sync_inodes_sb();
for_each_sb
        sync_fs(wait);
for_each_sb
        __sync_blockdev(wait);
