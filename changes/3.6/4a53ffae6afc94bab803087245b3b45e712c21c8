pstore/ram_core: Get rid of prz->ecc_symsize and prz->ecc_poly

The struct members were never used anywhere outside of
persistent_ram_init_ecc(), so there's actually no need for them
to be in the struct.

If we ever want to make polynomial or symbol size configurable,
it would make more sense to just pass initialized rs_decoder
to the persistent_ram init functions.
