ext4: avoid uneeded calls to ext4_mb_load_buddy() while reading mb_groups

Currently ext4_mb_load_buddy is called for every group, irrespective
of whether the group info is already in memory, while reading
/proc/fs/ext4/<partition>/mb_groups proc file.  For the purpose of
mb_groups proc file, it is unnecessary to load the file group info
from disk if it was loaded in past.  These calls to ext4_mb_load_buddy
make reading the mb_groups proc file expensive.

Also, the locks around ext4_get_group_info are not required.

This patch modifies the code to call ext4_mb_load_buddy only if the
group info had never been loaded into memory in past. It also removes
the mb group locking around ext4_get_group_info call.
