pwm: Add table-based lookup for static mappings

In order to get rid of the global namespace for PWM devices, this commit
provides an alternative method, similar to that of the regulator or
clock frameworks, for registering a static mapping for PWM devices. This
works by providing a table with a provider/consumer map in the board
setup code.

With the new pwm_get() and pwm_put() functions available, usage of
pwm_request() and pwm_free() becomes deprecated.
