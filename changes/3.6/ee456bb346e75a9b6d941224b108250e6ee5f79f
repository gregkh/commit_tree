powerpc/ftrace: Have PPC skip updating with stop_machine()

PowerPC does not have the synchronization issues that x86 has with
modifying code on one CPU while another CPU is executing it.
The other CPU will either see the old or new code without any
issues, unlike x86 which may issue a GPF.

Instead of calling the heavy stop_machine, just update the code.
