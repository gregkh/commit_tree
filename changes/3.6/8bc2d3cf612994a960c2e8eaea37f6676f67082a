eCryptfs: Unlink lower inode when ecryptfs_create() fails

ecryptfs_create() creates a lower inode, allocates an eCryptfs inode,
initializes the eCryptfs inode and cryptographic metadata attached to
the inode, and then writes the metadata to the header of the file.

If an error was to occur after the lower inode was created, an empty
lower file would be left in the lower filesystem. This is a problem
because ecryptfs_open() refuses to open any lower files which do not
have the appropriate metadata in the file header.

This patch properly unlinks the lower inode when an error occurs in the
later stages of ecryptfs_create(), reducing the chance that an empty
lower file will be left in the lower filesystem.
