ARM: 7526/1: traps: send SIGILL if get_user fails on undef handling path

get_user may fail to load from the provided __user address due to an
unhandled fault generated by the access.

In the case of the undefined instruction trap, this results in failure
to load the faulting instruction, in which case we should send SIGILL to
the task rather than continue with potentially uninitialised data.
