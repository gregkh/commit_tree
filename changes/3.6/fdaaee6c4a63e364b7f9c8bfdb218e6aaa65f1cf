[media] DVB: stb0899: speed up getting BER values

stb0899_read_ber() takes 500ms (half a second!) to deliver the current
BER value. Apparently it takes 5 subsequent readings, with a 100ms pause
between them (and even before the first one). This is a real performance
brake if an application freqeuently reads the BER of several devices.
The attached patch reduces this to a single reading, with no more pausing.
I didn't observe any negative side effects of this change.
