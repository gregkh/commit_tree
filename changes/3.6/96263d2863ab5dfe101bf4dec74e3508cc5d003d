init: add comments to keep initcall-names in sync with initcall levels

main.c has initcall_level_names[] for parse_args to print in debug messages,
add comments to keep them in sync with initcalls defined in init.h.

Also add "loadable" into comment re not using *_initcall macros in
modules, to disambiguate from kernel/params.c and other builtins.
