ipv6: fix incorrect route 'expires' value passed to userspace

When userspace use RTM_GETROUTE to dump route table, with an already
expired route entry, we always got an 'expires' value(2147157)
calculated base on INT_MAX.

The reason of this problem is in the following satement:
	rt->dst.expires - jiffies < INT_MAX
gcc promoted the type of both sides of '<' to unsigned long, thus
a small negative value would be considered greater than INT_MAX.

With the help of Eric Dumazet, do the out of bound checks in
rtnl_put_cacheinfo(), _after_ conversion to clock_t.
