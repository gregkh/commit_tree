[SCSI] fc: add some more FC specific stats to fc_host

The libfc provides more flexibility and with that
we can monitor some more FC specific stats for
FC exches or FCP error cases, this patch add
such new FC stats.

The patch adds *only* FC specific new stats to
existing fc_host attribute container.

Added stats names are self explanatory as
existing FC stats already has, however anyway
still added commentary along their definition
to describe them.
