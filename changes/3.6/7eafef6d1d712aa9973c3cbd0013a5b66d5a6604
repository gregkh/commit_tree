alpha: remove mysterious if zero-ed out includes

There's a small group of odd looking includes in smc37c669.c.  These
includes appear to be if zero-ed out ever since they were added to the
tree (in v2.1.89).  Their purpose is unclear to me.  Perhaps they were
used in someones build system.  Whatever their purpose was, nothing else
uses something comparable.  This entire if zero-ed out block might as well
be removed.
