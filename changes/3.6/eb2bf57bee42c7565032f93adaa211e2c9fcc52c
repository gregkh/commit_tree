uprobes: No need to re-check vma_address() in write_opcode()

write_opcode() is called by register_for_each_vma() and
uprobe_mmap() paths. In both cases the caller has already
verified this vaddr under mmap_sem, no need to re-check.

Note also that this check is wrong anyway, we should not
truncate loff_t returned by vma_address() if we do not trust
this mapping.
