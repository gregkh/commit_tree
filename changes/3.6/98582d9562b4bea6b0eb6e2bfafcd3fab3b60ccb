ARM: ux500: Remove unused i2c platform_data initialisation code

Now that u5500 is obsolete, u8500 is the only user of the Nomadik
i2c driver. As such there is no requirement to differentiate between
initialisation values. By the time a new SoC is released, almost all
of the ux500 platform will be DT:ed, so we can make decisions based
on the compatible property instead.
