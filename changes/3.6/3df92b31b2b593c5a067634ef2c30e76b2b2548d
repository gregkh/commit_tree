Bluetooth: Really fix registering hci with duplicate name

Commit fc50744 ("Bluetooth: Fix registering hci with duplicate name") didn't
fully fix the duplicate naming issue with devices, and duplicate device names
could still be created:

[  142.484097] device: 'hci1': device_add
[...]
[  150.545263] device: 'hci1': device_add
[  150.550128] kobject: 'hci1' (ffff880014cc4e58): kobject_add_internal: parent: 'bluetooth', set: 'devices'
[  150.558979] ------------[ cut here ]------------

[...]

Instead of the weird logic and the attempt at keeping the device list sorted,
just use an IDA.
