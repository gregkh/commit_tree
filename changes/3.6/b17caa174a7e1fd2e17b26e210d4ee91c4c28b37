[SCSI] libsas: fix sas_discover_devices return code handling

commit 198439e4 [SCSI] libsas: do not set res = 0 in sas_ex_discover_dev()
commit 19252de6 [SCSI] libsas: fix wide port hotplug issues

The above commits seem to have confused the return value of
sas_ex_discover_dev which is non-zero on failure and
sas_ex_join_wide_port which just indicates short circuiting discovery on
already established ports.  The result is random discovery failures
depending on configuration.

Calls to sas_ex_join_wide_port are the source of the trouble as its
return value is errantly assigned to 'res'.  Convert it to bool and stop
returning its result up the stack.
