rbd: use rbd_dev consistently

Most variables that represent a struct rbd_device are named
"rbd_dev", but in some cases "dev" is used instead.  Change all the
"dev" references so they use "rbd_dev" consistently, to make it
clear from the name that we're working with an RBD device (as
opposed to, for example, a struct device).  Similarly, change the
name of the "dev" field in struct rbd_notify_info to be "rbd_dev".
