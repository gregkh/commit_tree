fs/proc: fix potential unregister_sysctl_table hang

The unregister_sysctl_table() function hangs if all references to its
ctl_table_header structure are not dropped.

This can happen sometimes because of a leak in proc_sys_lookup():
proc_sys_lookup() gets a reference to the table via lookup_entry(), but
it does not release it when a subsequent call to sysctl_follow_link()
fails.

This patch fixes this leak by making sure the reference is always
dropped on return.

See also commit 076c3eed2c31 ("sysctl: Rewrite proc_sys_lookup
introducing find_entry and lookup_entry") which reorganized this code in
3.4.

Tested in Linux 3.4.4.
