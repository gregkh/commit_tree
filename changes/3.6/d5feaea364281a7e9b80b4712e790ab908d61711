s390/mm: fix deadlock in unmap_hugepage_range()

git commit cd2934a3 moved the flush_tlb_range() within
__unmap_hugepage_range() inside the mm->page_table_lock, which
triggered a deadlock in s390 tlb flushing code. __tlb_flush_mm_cond()
also tries to acquire the mm->page_table_lock, but that is not needed
because all callers already have mm->mmap_sem or mm->page_table_lock,
so it can be safely removed to fix the deadlock.
