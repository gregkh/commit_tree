bcma: remove chip ids doing nothing from PMU initialization.

The list of devices where nothing has to be done in
bcma_pmu_resources_init() and bcma_pmu_workarounds() is longer as all
the SoCs are missing there and some new devices will be added in some
time later. This patch changes the default case to just log on debug
level and also let the other devices which do not need any special
handling into the default case, instead of adding the missing 8 SoC
chip ids.
