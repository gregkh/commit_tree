wlcore: enable sched scan while connected

New wl12xx firmware supports scheduled scans also while connected.
Stop blocking sched scan requests when connected and add a quirk to
block in hardware that don't support it (currently wl18xx doesn't).

This requires FW version 6/7.3.10.2.112 for single-role and
6/7.5.6.0.25 for multi-role.
