lib/scatterlist: do not re-write gfp_flags in __sg_alloc_table()

We are seeing a lot of sg_alloc_table allocation failures using the new
drm prime infrastructure.  We isolated the cause to code in
__sg_alloc_table that was re-writing the gfp_flags.

There is a comment in the code that suggest that there is an assumption
about the allocation coming from a memory pool.  This was likely true
when sg lists were primarily used for disk I/O.
