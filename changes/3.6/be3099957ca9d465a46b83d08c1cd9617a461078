Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _DDR_SETTING and call directly.

This patch removes the typedef for _DDR_SETTING,
changes the name of the struct from _DDR_SETTING,
to bcm_ddr_setting. In addition, any calls to the
following typedefs "DDR_SET_NODE and *PDDR_SET_NODE"
are changed to call the struct directly.
