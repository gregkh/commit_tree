remoteproc: remove the now-redundant kref

Now that every rproc instance contains a device, we don't need a
kref anymore to maintain the refcount of the rproc instances:
that's what device are good with!

This patch removes the now-redundant kref, and switches to
{get, put}_device instead of kref_{get, put}.

We also don't need the kref's release function anymore, and instead,
we just utilize the class's release handler (which is now responsible
for all memory de-allocations).
