sbs-battery: Don't trigger false supply_changed event

power_supply_changed() events are triggerd based on the return value
of a get_property() call. However the property TECHNOLOGY is
hard-coded to LION in this driver, thus always succeeds.

So, with the battery removed, this triggers a false battery present
uevent. This uevent triggers a new query via power_supply_uevent()
which again starts to query all known properties and thus leads to
an infinite loop of battery present/not-present uevents.

This patch skips the battery presence detection for the hard-coded
property TECHNOLOGY.
