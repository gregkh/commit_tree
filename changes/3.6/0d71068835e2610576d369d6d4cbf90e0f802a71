drm/i915: try to train DP even harder

While debugging Haswell link train failures I observed that we never
try the maximum voltage configuration more than once consecutively. We
start the training, the monitor keeps telling us to increase the
voltage, then when we reach the maximum we just go back to the start
(because of the "memset" above "voltage_tries = 0"). When we reach
this point, we keep alternating between the maximum and the minimum
voltages until we give up.

The DP spec suggests that we should try the same voltage 5 times
before giving up. This patch makes us try the maximum voltage at
least 5 times before going back to the minimum voltages.

This patch does not fix any particular bug I'm aware of.
