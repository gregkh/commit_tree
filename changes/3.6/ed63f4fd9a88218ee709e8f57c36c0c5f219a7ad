rbd: drop rbd_header_from_disk() gfp_flags parameter

The function rbd_header_from_disk() is only called in one spot, and
it passes GFP_KERNEL as its value for the gfp_flags parameter.

Just drop that parameter and substitute GFP_KERNEL everywhere within
that function it had been used.  (If we find we need the parameter
again in the future it's easy enough to add back again.)
