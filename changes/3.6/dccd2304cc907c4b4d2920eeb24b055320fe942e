ARM: 7430/1: sizes.h: move from asm-generic to <linux/sizes.h>

sizes.h is used throughout the AMBA code and drivers, so the header
should be available to everyone in order to driver AMBA/PrimeCell
peripherals behind a PCI bridge where the host can be any platform
(I'm doing it under x86).

At this step <asm-generic/sizes.h> includes <linux/sizes.h>,
to allow a grace period for both in-tree and out-of-tree drivers.
