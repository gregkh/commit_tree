ARM: OMAP2+: SmartReflex: Use per-OPP data structure

The SmartReflex driver incorrectly treats some per-OPP data as data
common to all OPPs (e.g., ERRMINLIMIT).  Move this data into a per-OPP
data structure.

Furthermore, in order to make the SmartReflex implementation ready for
the move to drivers/, remove the dependency from the SR driver code
to the voltage layer by querying the data tables only from the SR device
init code.

Based on Paul's original code for the SmartReflex driver conversion.
