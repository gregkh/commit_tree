USB: EHCI: simplify isochronous scanning

This patch (as1587) simplifies ehci-hcd's scan_isoc() routine by
eliminating some local variables, declaring boolean-valued values as
bool rather than unsigned, changing variable names to make more sense,
and so on.

The logic at the end of the routine is cut down significantly.  The
scanning doesn't have to catch up all the way to where the hardware
is; it merely has to catch up to where the hardware was when the last
interrupt occurred.  If the hardware has made more progress since then
and issued another interrupt, a rescan will catch up to it.
