staging: vt6656: iwctl: fix up function declarations/prototypes

The way function prototypes/declarations are written in iwctl.[ch] is
an inconsistent mess.

This patch makes the whole thing consistent by putting the first
function arguments (op to a column width of at most 80) on the same
line as the function name and the remaining ones on the following line
indented by two tabs.

Besides getting rid of the current tabs vs spaces mess it also
shortens the files quite a bit and puts them more in line with most
other kernel files.
