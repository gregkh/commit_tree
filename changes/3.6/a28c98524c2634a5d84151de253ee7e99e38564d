staging: comedi: adl_pci6208: cleanup pci6208_pci_setup()

The "local configuration register" stuff is not required. The
io base/range are only queried for use in a kernel message
that it just added noise. Similar with the io range for the
actual io base used by the driver.

Remove both printk's and all the unnecessary code.
