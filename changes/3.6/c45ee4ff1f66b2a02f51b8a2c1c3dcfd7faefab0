wlcore: change the wait for event mechanism

wlcore needs to wait for certain events for example
for roc complete event. Usually the events are received
from the FW very fast, therefore wlcore can poll with
a short delay and if after a second the event was
not received yet poll with a long (1-5 msec) delay.

This implementation is similar to the sending of
commands to the FW.

Empirically the change reduced the wait for roc event
from ~10-40msec to 100s of usecs.
