btrfs: ignore unfragmented file checks in defrag when compression enabled - rebased

Rebased on btrfs-next and retested.

Inform should_defrag_range if BTRFS_DEFRAG_RANGE_COMPRESS is set. If so, skip
checks for adjacent extents and extent size when deciding whether to defrag,
as these can prevent an uncompressed and unfragmented file from being
compressed as requested.
