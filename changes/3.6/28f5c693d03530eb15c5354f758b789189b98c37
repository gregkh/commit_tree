rcu: Remove function versions of __kfree_rcu and __is_kfree_rcu_offset

Commit d8169d4c (Make __kfree_rcu() less dependent on compiler choices)
added cpp macro versions of __kfree_rcu() and __is_kfree_rcu_offset(),
but failed to remove the old inline-function versions.  This commit does
this cleanup.
