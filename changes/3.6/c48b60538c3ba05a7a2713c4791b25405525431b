perf/x86: Use rdpmc() rather than rdmsr() when possible in the kernel

The rdpmc instruction is faster than the equivelant rdmsr call,
so use it when possible in the kernel.

The perfctr kernel patches did this, after extensive testing showed
rdpmc to always be faster (One can look in etc/costs in the perfctr-2.6
package to see a historical list of the overhead).

I have done some tests on a 3.2 kernel, the kernel module I used
was included in the first posting of this patch:

                   rdmsr           rdpmc
 Core2 T9900:      203.9 cycles     30.9 cycles
 AMD fam0fh:        56.2 cycles      9.8 cycles
 Atom 6/28/2:      129.7 cycles     50.6 cycles

The speedup of using rdpmc is large.

[ It's probably possible (and desirable) to do this without
  requiring a new field in the hw_perf_event structure, but
  the fixed events make this tricky. ]
