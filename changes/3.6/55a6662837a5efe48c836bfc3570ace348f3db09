    drm/i915: reset the GPU on context fini

broke module unload because it reset the gpu before we've stopped
touching it. Later on in the unload sequence the ringbuffer code
complained that the gpu would idle properly (because intel_gpu_reset
only resets the hw and not our sw state).

v2: Reorder things so that we reset the gpu _before_ we release the
backing storage of the default context.
