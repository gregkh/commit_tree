USB: add USB_VENDOR_AND_INTERFACE_INFO() macro

A lot of Broadcom Bluetooth devices provides vendor specific interface
class and we are getting flooded by patches adding new device support.
This change will help us enable support for any other Broadcom with vendor
specific device that arrives in the future.

Only the product id changes for those devices, so this macro would be
perfect for us:

{ USB_VENDOR_AND_INTERFACE_INFO(0x0a5c, 0xff, 0x01, 0x01) }
