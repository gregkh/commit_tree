brcmsmac: restructure info->control.sta handling as it is goning to be removed soon.

brcmsmac uses info->control.sta while doing ampdu aggregation. This patch
changes the usage of the structure info->control.sta, as it is going to be
removed soon from struct ieee80211_tx_info. This patch is a pre-requisit in
order to add transmission power control (TPC) to the mac80211 subsystem.
