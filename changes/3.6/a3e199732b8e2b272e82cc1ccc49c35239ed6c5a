ALSA: hda - Fix mute-LED GPIO setup for HP Mini 210

BIOS on HP Mini 210 doesn't provide the proper "HP_Mute_LED" DMI
string, thus the driver doesn't initialize the GPIO, too.  In the
earlier kernel, the driver falls back to GPIO1, but since 3.3 we've
stopped this due to other wrongly advertised machines.

For fixing this particular case, add a new model type to specify the
default polarity explicitly so that the fallback to GPIO1 is handled.
