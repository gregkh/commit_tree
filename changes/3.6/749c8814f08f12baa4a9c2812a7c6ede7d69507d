sched: Add missing call to calc_load_exit_idle()

Azat Khuzhin reported high loadavg in Linux v3.6

After checking the upstream scheduler code, I found Peter's commit:

  5167e8d5417b sched/nohz: Rewrite and fix load-avg computation -- again

not fully applied, missing the call to calc_load_exit_idle().

After that idle exit in sampling window will always be calculated
to non-idle, and the load will be higher than normal.

This patch adds the missing call to calc_load_exit_idle().
