sched: Reset loop counters if all tasks are pinned and we need to redo load balance

While load balancing, if all tasks on the source runqueue are pinned,
we retry after excluding the corresponding source cpu. However, loop counters
env.loop and env.loop_break are not reset before retrying, which can lead
to failure in moving the tasks. In this patch we reset env.loop and
env.loop_break to their inital values before we retry.
