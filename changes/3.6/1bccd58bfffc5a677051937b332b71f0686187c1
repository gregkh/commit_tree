x86/apic: Try to spread IRQ vectors to different priority levels

When assigning a new vector it is primarially done by adding 8
to the previously given out vector number. Hence, two
consequently allocated vector numbers would likely fall into the
same priority level. Try to spread vector numbers to different
priority levels better by changing the step from 8 to 16.
