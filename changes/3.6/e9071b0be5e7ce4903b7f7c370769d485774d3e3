iommu/dmar: Use pr_format() instead of PREFIX to tidy up pr_*() calls

Joe Perches recommended getting rid of the redundant
formatting of adding "PREFIX" to all the uses of pr_*() calls.

The recommendation helps to reduce source and improve
readibility.

While cleaning up the PREFIX's, I saw that one of
the pr_warn() was redundant in dmar_parse_one_dev_scope(),
since the same message was printed after breaking out of the
while loop for the same condition, !pdev.
So, to avoid a duplicate message, I removed the one in the while
loop.
