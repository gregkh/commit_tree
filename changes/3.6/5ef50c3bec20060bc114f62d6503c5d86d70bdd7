ceph: simplify+fix atomic_open

The initial ->atomic_open op was carried over from the old intent code,
which was incomplete and didn't really work.  Replace it with a fresh
method.  In particular:

 * always attempt to do an atomic open+lookup, both for the create case
   and for lookups of existing files.
 * fix symlink handling by returning 1 to the VFS so that we can follow
   the link to its destination. This fixes a longstanding ceph bug (#2392).
