md: remove duplicated test on ->openers when calling do_md_stop()

do_md_stop tests mddev->openers while holding ->open_mutex,
and fails if this count is too high.
So callers do not need to check mddev->openers and doing so isn't
very meaningful as they don't hold ->open_mutex so the number could
change.

So remove the unnecessary tests on mddev->openers.
These are not called often enough for there to be any gain in
an early test on ->open_mutex to avoid the need for a slightly more
costly mutex_lock call.
