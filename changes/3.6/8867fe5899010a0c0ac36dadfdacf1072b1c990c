nfs: clean up ->create in nfs_rpc_ops

Don't pass nfs_open_context() to ->create().  Only the NFS4 implementation
needed that and only because it wanted to return an open file using open
intents.  That task has been replaced by ->atomic_open so it is not necessary
anymore to pass the context to the create rpc operation.

Despite nfs4_proc_create apparently being okay with a NULL context it Oopses
somewhere down the call chain.  So allocate a context here.
