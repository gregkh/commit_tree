ARM: OMAP4: sleep: Save the complete used register stack frame

OMAP4 sleep entry code even though itself don't use many CPU registers
makes call to the v7_flush_dcache_all() which uses them. Since
v7_flush_dcache_all() doesn't make use of stack, the caller must take
care of the stack frame. Otherwise it will lead to corrupted stack frame.

Fix it by saving used registers.
