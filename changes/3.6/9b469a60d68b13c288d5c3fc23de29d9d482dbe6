net: qmi_wwan: add Sierra Wireless devices

Add 6 new devices and one modified device, based on
information from laptop vendor Windows drivers.

Sony provides a driver with two new devices using
a Gobi 2k+ layout (1199:68a5 and 1199:68a9).  The
Sony driver also adds a non-standard QMI/net
interface to the already supported 1199:9011
Gobi device. We do not know whether this is an
alternate interface number or an additional
interface which might be present, but that doesn't
really matter.

Lenovo provides a driver supporting 4 new devices:
 - MC7770 (1199:901b) with standard Gobi 2k+ layout
 - MC7700 (0f3d:68a2) with layout similar to MC7710
 - MC7750 (114f:68a2) with layout similar to MC7710
 - EM7700 (1199:901c) with layout similar to MC7710

Note regaring the three devices similar to MC7710:

The Windows drivers only support interface #8 on these
devices.  The MC7710 can support QMI/net functions on
interface #19 and #20 as well, and this driver is
verified to work on interface #19 (a firmware bug is
suspected to prevent #20 from working).

We do not enable these additional interfaces until they
either show up in a Windows driver or are verified to
work in some other way.  Therefore limiting the new
devices to interface #8 for now.
