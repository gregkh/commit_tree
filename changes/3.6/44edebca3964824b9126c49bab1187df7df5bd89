video: backlight: remove unused header

Commit 9befe40f6e018e508b047eb76d189ede9b4ff03d ("video: backlight:
support s6e8ax0 panel driver based on MIPI DSI") added s6e8ax0.h, but
no file includes it. That's probably a good thing, because it declares
an extern void function that is defined static int in s6e8ax0.c.
Besides, that function is also wrapped in the module_init() macro, which
should do everything needed to make that function available to the code
outside of s6e8ax0.c. This header can safely be removed.
