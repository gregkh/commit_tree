ASoC: dapm: Fix _PRE and _POST events for DAPM performance improvements

Ever since the DAPM performance improvements we've been marking all widgets
as not dirty after each DAPM run. Since _PRE and _POST events aren't part
of the DAPM graph this has rendered them non-functional, they will never be
marked dirty again and thus will never be run again.

Fix this by skipping them when marking widgets as not dirty.
