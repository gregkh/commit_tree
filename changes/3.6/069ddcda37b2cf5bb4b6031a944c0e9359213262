eCryptfs: Copy up POSIX ACL and read-only flags from lower mount

When the eCryptfs mount options do not include '-o acl', but the lower
filesystem's mount options do include 'acl', the MS_POSIXACL flag is not
flipped on in the eCryptfs super block flags. This flag is what the VFS
checks in do_last() when deciding if the current umask should be applied
to a newly created inode's mode or not. When a default POSIX ACL mask is
set on a directory, the current umask is incorrectly applied to new
inodes created in the directory. This patch ignores the MS_POSIXACL flag
passed into ecryptfs_mount() and sets the flag on the eCryptfs super
block depending on the flag's presence on the lower super block.

Additionally, it is incorrect to allow a writeable eCryptfs mount on top
of a read-only lower mount. This missing check did not allow writes to
the read-only lower mount because permissions checks are still performed
on the lower filesystem's objects but it is best to simply not allow a
rw mount on top of ro mount. However, a ro eCryptfs mount on top of a rw
mount is valid and still allowed.
