drm/radeon: implement ring saving on reset v4

Try to save whatever is on the rings when
we encounter an lockup.

v2: Fix spelling error. Free saved ring data if reset fails.
    Add documentation for the new functions.
v3: Some more spelling fixes
v4: It doesn't make sense to save anything if all fences
    are signaled
