ALSA: usb-audio: Fix bogus error messages for delay accounting

The recent fix for the missing fine delayed time adjustment gives
strange error messages at each start of the playback stream, such as
  delay: estimated 0, actual 352
  delay: estimated 353, actual 705

These come from the sanity check in retire_playback_urb().  Before the
stream is activated via start_endpoints(), a few silent packets have
been already sent.  And at this point the delay account is still in
the state as if the new packets are just queued, so the driver gets
confused and spews the bogus error messages.

For fixing the issue, we just need to check whether the received
packet is valid, whether it's zero sized or not.
