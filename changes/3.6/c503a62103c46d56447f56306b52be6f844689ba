dlm: fix conversion deadlock from recovery

The process of rebuilding locks on a new master during
recovery could re-order the locks on the convert queue,
creating an "in place" conversion deadlock that would
not be resolved.  Fix this by not considering queue
order when granting conversions after recovery.
