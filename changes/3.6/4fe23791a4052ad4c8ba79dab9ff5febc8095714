regulator: add missing defintion regulator_is_supported_voltage

This definition is missing when CONFIG_REGULATOR is not defined.
This causes compiler errors when compiling sdhci.c.  This can
be worked around by adding #ifdef CONFIG_REGULATOR .. #endif
but since other definitions are there we have defined the missing
definition
