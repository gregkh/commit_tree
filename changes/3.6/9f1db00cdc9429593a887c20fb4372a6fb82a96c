Bluetooth: debug: Use standard hex object specifiers in hci_event

To help debugging printed hex object use standard bluetooth
specifiers in hci_event. The patch changes format from 0x%04x to 0x%4.4x;
print manufacturer id and handle in hex instead of int; print opcode
always in 0x%4.4x format; status in 0x%2.2x.
