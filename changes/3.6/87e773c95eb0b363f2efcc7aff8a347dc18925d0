UBI: harmonize the update of ubi->beb_rsvd_pebs

Currently, there are several locations where an attempt to reserve more
PEBs for bad PEB handling is made, with the same code being duplicated.

Harmonize it by introducing 'ubi_update_reserved()'.

Also, improve the debug message issued, making it more descriptive.

Artem: amended the patch a little.
