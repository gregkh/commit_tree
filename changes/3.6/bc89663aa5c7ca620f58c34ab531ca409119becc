ARM: fiq: change FIQ_START to a variable

The commit a2be01b (ARM: only include mach/irqs.h for !SPARSE_IRQ)
makes mach/irqs.h only be included for !SPARSE_IRQ build.  There are
a nubmer of platforms have FIQ_START defined in mach/irqs.h for FIQ
support.

  arch/arm/mach-rpc/include/mach/irqs.h:#define FIQ_START         64
  arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx/include/mach/irqs.h:#define FIQ_START             IRQ_EINT0
  arch/arm/plat-mxc/include/mach/irqs.h:#define FIQ_START 0

If SPARSE_IRQ is enabled for any of these platforms, the following
compile error will be seen.

  arch/arm/kernel/fiq.c: In function ‘enable_fiq’:
  arch/arm/kernel/fiq.c:127:19: error: ‘FIQ_START’ undeclared (first use in this function)
  arch/arm/kernel/fiq.c:127:19: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
  arch/arm/kernel/fiq.c: In function ‘disable_fiq’:
  arch/arm/kernel/fiq.c:132:20: error: ‘FIQ_START’ undeclared (first use in this function)

The patch changes fiq code to have init_FIQ take FIQ_START from
platforms as a parameter and assign it to variable fiq_start which
is to replace FIQ_START uses in enable_fiq/disable_fiq.
