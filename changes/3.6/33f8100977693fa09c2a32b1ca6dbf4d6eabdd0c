can: c_can: Move overlay structure to array with offset as index

c_can uses overlay structure for accessing c_can module registers.
With this kind of implementation it is difficult to add one more ip
which is similar to c_can in functionality but different register
offsets.

This patch changes the overlay structure implementation to an array
with register offset as index. This way we can overcome the above
limitation.
