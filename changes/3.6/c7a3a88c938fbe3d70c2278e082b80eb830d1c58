uprobes: Fix mmap_region()'s mm->mm_rb corruption if uprobe_mmap() fails

This patch fixes:

  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=843640

If mmap_region()->uprobe_mmap() fails, unmap_and_free_vma path
does unmap_region() but does not remove the soon-to-be-freed vma
from rb tree. Actually there are more problems but this is how
William noticed this bug.

Perhaps we could do do_munmap() + return in this case, but in
fact it is simply wrong to abort if uprobe_mmap() fails. Until
at least we move the !UPROBE_COPY_INSN code from
install_breakpoint() to uprobe_register().

For example, uprobe_mmap()->install_breakpoint() can fail if the
probed insn is not supported (remember, uprobe_register()
succeeds if nobody mmaps inode/offset), mmap() should not fail
in this case.

dup_mmap()->uprobe_mmap() is wrong too by the same reason,
fork() can race with uprobe_register() and fail for no reason if
it wins the race and does install_breakpoint() first.

And, if nothing else, both mmap_region() and dup_mmap() return
success if uprobe_mmap() fails. Change them to ignore the error
code from uprobe_mmap().
