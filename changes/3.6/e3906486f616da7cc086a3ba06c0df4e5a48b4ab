net: fix race condition in several drivers when reading stats

Fix race condition in several network drivers when reading stats on 32bit
UP architectures.  These drivers update their stats in a BH context and
therefore should use u64_stats_fetch_begin_bh/u64_stats_fetch_retry_bh
instead of u64_stats_fetch_begin/u64_stats_fetch_retry when reading the
stats.
