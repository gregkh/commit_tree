fault-injection: add selftests for cpu and memory hotplug

This adds two selftests

* tools/testing/selftests/cpu-hotplug/on-off-test.sh is testing script
for CPU hotplug

1. Online all hot-pluggable CPUs
2. Offline all hot-pluggable CPUs
3. Online all hot-pluggable CPUs again
4. Exit if cpu-notifier-error-inject.ko is not available
5. Offline all hot-pluggable CPUs in preparation for testing
6. Test CPU hot-add error handling by injecting notifier errors
7. Online all hot-pluggable CPUs in preparation for testing
8. Test CPU hot-remove error handling by injecting notifier errors

* tools/testing/selftests/memory-hotplug/on-off-test.sh is doing the
similar thing for memory hotplug.

1. Online all hot-pluggable memory
2. Offline 10% of hot-pluggable memory
3. Online all hot-pluggable memory again
4. Exit if memory-notifier-error-inject.ko is not available
5. Offline 10% of hot-pluggable memory in preparation for testing
6. Test memory hot-add error handling by injecting notifier errors
7. Online all hot-pluggable memory in preparation for testing
8. Test memory hot-remove error handling by injecting notifier errors
