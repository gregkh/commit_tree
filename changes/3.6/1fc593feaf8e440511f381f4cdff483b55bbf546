ARM: imx: build i.MX6 functions only when needed

The head-v7.S contains a call to the generic cpu_suspend function,
which is only available when selected by the i.MX6 code. As
pointed out by Shawn Guo, i.MX5 does not actually use any
functions defined in head-v7.S. It is also needed only for
the i.MX6 power management code and for the SMP code, so
we can restrict building this file to situations in which
at least one of those two is present.

Finally, other platforms with a similar file call it headsmp.S,
so we can rename it to the same for consistency.

Without this patch, building imx5 standalone results in:

arch/arm/mach-imx/built-in.o: In function `v7_cpu_resume':
arch/arm/mach-imx/head-v7.S:104: undefined reference to `cpu_resume'
