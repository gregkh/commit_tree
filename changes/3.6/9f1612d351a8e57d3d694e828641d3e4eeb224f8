clk: fix clk_get on of_clk_get_by_name return check

The commit 766e6a4 (clk: add DT clock binding support) plugs device
tree clk lookup of_clk_get_by_name into clk_get, and fall on non-DT
lookup clk_get_sys if DT lookup fails.

The return check on of_clk_get_by_name takes (clk != NULL) as a
successful DT lookup.  But it's not the case.  For any system that
does not define clk lookup in device tree, ERR_PTR(-ENOENT) will be
returned, and consequently, all the client drivers calling clk_get
in their probe functions will fail to probe with error code -ENOENT
returned.

Fix the issue by checking of_clk_get_by_name return with !IS_ERR(clk),
and update of_clk_get and of_clk_get_by_name for !CONFIG_OF build
correspondingly.
