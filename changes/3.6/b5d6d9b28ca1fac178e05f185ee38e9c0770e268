wlcore/wl12xx/wl18xx: don't use TX align quirk for wl127x

Commit 4afc37 (wlcore: reorder identify_chip and get_hw_info) broke
support for wl127x chips.

When we moved the identify_chip operation to an earlier stage (ie. to
the probe function), we broke wl127x support because during HW init we
would set the WLCORE_QUIRK_TX_BLOCKSIZE_ALIGN.

To avoid this, set this quirk in the identify_chip operations and only
force it to be unset if the bus module doesn't support it.  We were
doing the opposite and setting the flag if the bus module supports it.
