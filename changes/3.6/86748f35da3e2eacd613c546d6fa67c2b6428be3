[media] v4l2-ioctl.c: v4l2-ioctl: add debug and callback/offset functionality

Add the necessary plumbing to make it possible to replace the switch by a
table driven implementation.

The ioctls ops can either be called directly, or by calling a small function
that does some additional work if needed.
