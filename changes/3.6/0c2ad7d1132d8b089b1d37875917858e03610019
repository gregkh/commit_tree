target: add struct spc_ops + initial ->execute_rw pointer usage

Remove the execute_cmd method in struct se_subsystem_api, and always use the
one directly in struct se_cmd.  To make life simpler for SBC virtual backends
a struct spc_ops that is passed to sbc_parse_cmd is added.  For now it
only contains an execute_rw member, but more will follow with the subsequent
commits.
