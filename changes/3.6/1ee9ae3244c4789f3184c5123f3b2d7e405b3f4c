drm/i915: use hsw rps tuning values everywhere on gen6+

James Bottomley reported [1] a massive power regression, due to the
enabling of semaphores by default in 3.5. A workaround for him is to
again disable semaphores. And indeed, his system has a very hard time
to enter rc6 with semaphores enabled.

Ben Widawsky run around with a kill-a-watt a lot and noticed:
- There are indeed a few rare systems that seem to have a hard time
  entering rc6 when desktop-idle.
- One machine, The Indestructible Toshiba regressed in this behaviour
  between 3.5 and 3.6 in a merge commit! So rc6 behaviour with the
  current setting seems to be highly timing dependent and not robust
  at all.
- The behaviour James reported wrt semaphores seems to be a freak
  timing thing that only happens on his specific machine, confirming
  that enabling semaphores shouldn't reduce rc6 residency.

Now furthermore the Google ChromeOS guys reported [2] a while ago that
at least on some machines a simply a blinking cursor can keep the gpu
turbo at the highest frequency. This is because the current rps limits
used on snb/ivb are highly asymmetric.

On the theory that gpu turbo and rc6 tuning values are related, we've
tried whether the much saner looking (since much less asymmetric) rps
tuning values used for hsw would also help entering rc6 more robustly.

And it seems to mostly work, and we don't really have the resources to
through-roughly tune things in any better way: The values from the
ChromeOS ppl seem to fare a bit worse for James' machine, so I guess
we better stick with something vpg (the gpu hw/windows group)
provided, hoping that they've done their jobs.
