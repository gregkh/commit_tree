dm thin: add read only and fail io modes

Add read-only and fail-io modes to thin provisioning.

If a transaction commit fails the pool's metadata device will transition
to "read-only" mode.  If a commit fails once already in read-only mode
the transition to "fail-io" mode occurs.

Once in fail-io mode the pool and all associated thin devices will
report a status of "Fail".
