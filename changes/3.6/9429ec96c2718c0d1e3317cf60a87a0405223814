um: Preinclude include/linux/kern_levels.h

The userspace part of UML uses the asm-offsets.h generator mechanism to
create definitions for UM_KERN_<LEVEL> that match the in-kernel
KERN_<LEVEL> constant definitions.

As of commit 04d2c8c83d0e3ac5f78aeede51babb3236200112 ("printk: convert
the format for KERN_<LEVEL> to a 2 byte pattern"), KERN_<LEVEL> is no
longer expanded to the literal '"<LEVEL>"', but to '"\001" "LEVEL"', i.e.
it contains two parts.

However, the combo of DEFINE_STR() in
arch/x86/um/shared/sysdep/kernel-offsets.h and sed-y in Kbuild doesn't
support string literals consisting of multiple parts. Hence for all
UM_KERN_<LEVEL> definitions, only the SOH character is retained in the actual
definition, while the remainder ends up in the comment. E.g. in
include/generated/asm-offsets.h we get

    #define UM_KERN_INFO "\001" /* "6" KERN_INFO */

instead of

    #define UM_KERN_INFO "\001" "6" /* KERN_INFO */

This causes spurious '^A' output in some kernel messages:

    Calibrating delay loop... 4640.76 BogoMIPS (lpj=23203840)
    pid_max: default: 32768 minimum: 301
    Mount-cache hash table entries: 256
    ^AChecking that host ptys support output SIGIO...Yes
    ^AChecking that host ptys support SIGIO on close...No, enabling workaround
    ^AUsing 2.6 host AIO
    NET: Registered protocol family 16
    bio: create slab <bio-0> at 0
    Switching to clocksource itimer

To fix this:
  - Move the mapping from UM_KERN_<LEVEL> to KERN_<LEVEL> from
    arch/um/include/shared/common-offsets.h to
    arch/um/include/shared/user.h, which is preincluded for all userspace
    parts,
  - Preinclude include/linux/kern_levels.h for all userspace parts, to
    obtain the in-kernel KERN_<LEVEL> constant definitions. This doesn't
    violate the kernel/userspace separation, as include/linux/kern_levels.h
    is self-contained and doesn't expose any other kernel internals.
  - Remove the now unused STR() and DEFINE_STR() macros.
