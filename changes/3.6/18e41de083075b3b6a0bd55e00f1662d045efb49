staging: comedi: amplc_pc236: Add attach_pci() hook

Implement the attach_pci() hook as function pc236_attach_pci().  This is
called bu comedi_pci_auto_config() in preference to the old attach()
hook (implemented by pc236_attach()) and avoids searching for the probed
PCI device.

Factor out code common to pc236_find_pci() and pc236_attach_pci() into
new function pc236_find_pci_board().  Factor out most code common to
pc236_attach() and pc236_attach_pci() into new functions
pc236_pci_common_attach() and pc236_common_attach().

Also #if out member 'devid' from struct pc236_board unless PCI boards
are supported as it is not used for ISA boards.
