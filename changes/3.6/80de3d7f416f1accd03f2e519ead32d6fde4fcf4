PM / Domains: Do not stop devices after restoring their states

While resuming a device belonging to a PM domain,
pm_genpd_runtime_resume() calls __pm_genpd_restore_device() to
restore its state, if necessary.  The latter starts the device,
using genpd_start_dev(), restores its state, using
genpd_restore_dev(), and then stops it, using genpd_stop_dev().
However, this last operation is not necessary, because the
device is supposed to be operational after pm_genpd_runtime_resume()
has returned and because of it pm_genpd_runtime_resume() has to
call genpd_start_dev() once again for the "restored" device, which
is inefficient.

To make things more efficient, remove the call to genpd_stop_dev()
from __pm_genpd_restore_device() and the direct call to
genpd_start_dev() from pm_genpd_runtime_resume().  [Of course,
genpd_start_dev() still has to be called by it for devices with the
power.irq_safe flag set, because __pm_genpd_restore_device() is not
executed for them.]

This change has been tested on the SH7372 Mackerel board.
