xen/netback: only non-freed SKB is queued into tx_queue

After SKB is queued into tx_queue, it will be freed if request_gop is NULL.
However, no dequeue action is called in this situation, it is likely that
tx_queue constains freed SKB. This patch should fix this issue, and it is
based on 3.5.0-rc4+.

This issue is found through code inspection, no bug is seen with it currently.
I run netperf test for several hours, and no network regression was found.
