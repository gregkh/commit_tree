watchdog: f71808e_wdt: Add support for Jetway JNF99 motherboard

The Jetway JNF99 motherboard features a F71869 SuperIO chip, but its
watchdog chipset ID appears to be 1007 (as opposed to 0814).  Some testing
confirmed it behaves the exact same as 0814. So add this chipset ID to the
module's ID list so that the Fintek watchdog driver can correctly identify
and access it.
