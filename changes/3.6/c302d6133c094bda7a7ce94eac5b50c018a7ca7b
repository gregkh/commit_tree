ALSA: hda_intel: add position_fix quirk for Asus K53E

Commit c20c5a841cbe47f5b7812b57bd25397497e5fbc0 changed some chipsets to
default to POS_FIX_COMBO so they now use POS_FIX_LPIB instead of
POS_FIX_POSBUF. Since then I've been getting artifacts on playback, including
repeated sounds on my Asus laptop.

My hardware is Cougar Point which the commit log of
c20c5a841cbe47f5b7812b57bd25397497e5fbc0 mentions as tested so POS_FIX_COMBO
probably works in general but apparently it doesn't on Asus K53E therefore the
need for the quirk.
