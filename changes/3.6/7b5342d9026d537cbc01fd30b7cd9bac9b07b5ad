bnx2x: Add missing afex code

Commit a334872224a67b614dc888460377862621f3dac7 added afex support but lacked
several logical changes. This lack can cause afex to crash, and also
have a slight effect on other flows (i.e., driver always assumes the Tx ring
has less available buffers than what it actually has).

This patch adds the missing segments, fixing said issues.
