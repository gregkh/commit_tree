drivers/rtc/rtc-r9701.c: check that r9701_set_datetime() succeeded

When the driver detects that the clock time is invalid, it attempts to
write a sane time into the hardware.  We curently assume that everything
is OK if those writes succeeded.  But it is better to re-read the time
from the hardware to ensure that the new settings got there OK.
