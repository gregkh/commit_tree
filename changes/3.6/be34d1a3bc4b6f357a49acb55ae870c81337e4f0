VFS: Make clone_mnt()/copy_tree()/collect_mounts() return errors

copy_tree() can theoretically fail in a case other than ENOMEM, but always
returns NULL which is interpreted by callers as -ENOMEM.  Change it to return
an explicit error.

Also change clone_mnt() for consistency and because union mounts will add new
error cases.

Thanks to Andreas Gruenbacher <agruen@suse.de> for a bug fix.
