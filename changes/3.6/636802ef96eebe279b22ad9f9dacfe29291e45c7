powerpc: Don't use __put_user() in patch_instruction

patch_instruction() can be called very early on ppc32, when the kernel
isn't yet running at it's linked address. That can cause the !
is_kernel_addr() test in __put_user() to trip and call might_sleep()
which is very bad at that point during boot.

Use a lower level function instead for now, at least until we get to
rework ppc32 boot process to do the code patching later, like ppc64
does.
