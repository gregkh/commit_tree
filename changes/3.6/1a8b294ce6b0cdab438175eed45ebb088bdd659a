HID: uhid: silence gcc warning

gcc is giving me:

drivers/hid/uhid.c: In function ‘uhid_hid_get_raw’:
drivers/hid/uhid.c:157: warning: ‘len’ may be used uninitialized in this function

which is clearly bogus, as

- when used as memcpy() argument, it's initialized properly
- the code is structured in a way that either 'ret' or 'len'
  is always initialized, so the return statement always has
  an initialized value.
