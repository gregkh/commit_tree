mm/hugetlb: add new HugeTLB cgroup

Implement a new controller that allows us to control HugeTLB allocations.
The extension allows to limit the HugeTLB usage per control group and
enforces the controller limit during page fault.  Since HugeTLB doesn't
support page reclaim, enforcing the limit at page fault time implies that,
the application will get SIGBUS signal if it tries to access HugeTLB pages
beyond its limit.  This requires the application to know beforehand how
much HugeTLB pages it would require for its use.

The charge/uncharge calls will be added to HugeTLB code in later patch.
Support for cgroup removal will be added in later patches.
