ext4: use memweight()

Convert ext4_count_free() to use memweight() instead of table lookup
based counting clear bits implementation.  This change only affects the
code segments enabled by EXT4FS_DEBUG.

Note that this memweight() call can't be replaced with a single
bitmap_weight() call, although the pointer to the memory area is aligned
to long-word boundary.  Because the size of the memory area may not be a
multiple of BITS_PER_LONG, then it returns wrong value on big-endian
architecture.

This also includes the following change.

- Remove unnecessary map == NULL check in ext4_count_free() which
  always takes non-null pointer as the memory area.
