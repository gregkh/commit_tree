drm/i915: s/i915_wait_request/i915_wait_seqno/g

Wait request is poorly named IMO. After working with these functions for
some time, I feel it's much clearer to name the functions more
appropriately.

Of course we must update the callers to use the new name as well.

This leaves room within our namespace for a *real* wait request function
at some point.

Note to maintainer: this patch is optional.
