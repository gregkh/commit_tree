Platform: OLPC: add a stub to drivers/platform/ for the OLPC EC driver

The OLPC EC driver has outgrown arch/x86/platform/.  It's time to both
share common code amongst different architectures, as well as move it out
of arch/x86/.  The XO-1.75 is ARM-based, and the EC driver shares a lot of
code with the x86 code.
