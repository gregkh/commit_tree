mac80211: add TX prepare API

Some drivers require setup before being able to send
management frames in managed mode, in particular in
multi-channel cases.

Introduce API to allow the drivers to do such setup
while being able to sleep waiting for the setup to
finish in the device. This isn't possible inside the
TX call since that can't sleep.

A future patch may also restructure the TX retry to
wait for the driver to report the frame status, as
suggested by Arik in
