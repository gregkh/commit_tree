mlx4_core: Allow guests to have IB ports

Modify mlx4_dev_cap to allow IB support when SR-IOV is active.  Modify
mlx4_slave_cap to set the "rdma-supported" bit in its flags area, and
pass that to the guests (this is done in QUERY_FUNC_CAP and its
wrapper).

However, we don't activate IB support quite yet -- we leave the error
return at the start of mlx4_ib_add in the mlx4_ib driver.

In addition, set "protected fmr supported" bit to zero in the
QUERY_FUNC_CAP wrapper.

Finally, in the QUERY_FUNC_CAP wrapper, we needed to add code which
checks for the port type (IB or Ethernet).  Previously, this was not
an issue, since only Ethernet ports were supported.
