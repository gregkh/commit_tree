cciss: fix handling of protocol error

If a command completes with a status of CMD_PROTOCOL_ERR, this
information should be conveyed to the SCSI mid layer, not dropped
on the floor.  Unlike a similar bug in the hpsa driver, this bug
only affects tape drives and CD and DVD ROM drives in the cciss
driver, and to induce it, you have to disconnect (or damage) a
cable, so it is not a very likely scenario (which would explain
why the bug has gone undetected for the last 10 years.)
