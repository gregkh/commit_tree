posix_types.h: Cleanup stale __NFDBITS and related definitions

Recently, glibc made a change to suppress sign-conversion warnings in
FD_SET (glibc commit ceb9e56b3d1).  This uncovered an issue with the
kernel's definition of __NFDBITS if applications #include
<linux/types.h> after including <sys/select.h>.  A build failure would
be seen when passing the -Werror=sign-compare and -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2
flags to gcc.

It was suggested that the kernel should either match the glibc
definition of __NFDBITS or remove that entirely.  The current in-kernel
uses of __NFDBITS can be replaced with BITS_PER_LONG, and there are no
uses of the related __FDELT and __FDMASK defines.  Given that, we'll
continue the cleanup that was started with commit 8b3d1cda4f5f
("posix_types: Remove fd_set macros") and drop the remaining unused
macros.

Additionally, linux/time.h has similar macros defined that expand to
nothing so we'll remove those at the same time.
