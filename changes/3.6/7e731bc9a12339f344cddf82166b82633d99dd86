ext4: avoid kmemcheck complaint from reading uninitialized memory

Commit 03179fe923 introduced a kmemcheck complaint in
ext4_da_get_block_prep() because we save and restore
ei->i_da_metadata_calc_last_lblock even though it is left
uninitialized in the case where i_da_metadata_calc_len is zero.

This doesn't hurt anything, but silencing the kmemcheck complaint
makes it easier for people to find real bugs.

Addresses https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=45631
(which is marked as a regression).
