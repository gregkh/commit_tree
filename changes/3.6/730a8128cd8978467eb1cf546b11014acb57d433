ARM: 7489/1: errata: fix workaround for erratum #720789 on UP systems

Commit 5a783cbc4836 ("ARM: 7478/1: errata: extend workaround for erratum
 #720789") added workarounds for erratum #720789 to the range TLB
invalidation functions with the observation that the erratum only
affects SMP platforms. However, when running an SMP_ON_UP kernel on a
uniprocessor platform we must take care to preserve the ASID as the
workaround is not required.

This patch ensures that we don't set the ASID to 0 when flushing the TLB
on such a system, preserving the original behaviour with the workaround
disabled.
