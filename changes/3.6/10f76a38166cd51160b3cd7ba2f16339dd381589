drm/i915: Inspect the right status bits for DP/HDMI hotplug on gen4

The status bits corresponding to the interrupt enable bits are the
"live" hotplug status bits, and reflect the current status of the port
(high for a detected connection, low for a disconnect). The actual bits
corresponding to the interrupt source are elsewhere. The actual event is
then determined by a combination of the interrupt flag and the current
live status (if the interrupt is active, but the current status is not,
then we have detected a disconnect.)
