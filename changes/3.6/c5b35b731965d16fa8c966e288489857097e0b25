tools lib traceevent: Fix trace_printk for long integers

On 32 bit systems, a conversion of the trace_printk format string
"%lu" -> "%llu" is intended (similar for %lx etc.) when a trace was
taken on a machine with 64 bit long integers. However, the current
code computes the bogus transformation "%lu" -> "%u".  Fix this.

Besides that, the transformation is only required on systems that don't
use 64 bits for long integers natively.
