mm: memcg: only check swap cache pages for repeated charging

Only anon and shmem pages in the swap cache are attempted to be charged
multiple times, from every swap pte fault or from shmem_unuse().  No other
pages require checking PageCgroupUsed().

Charging pages in the swap cache is also serialized by the page lock, and
since both the try_charge and commit_charge are called under the same page
lock section, the PageCgroupUsed() check might as well happen before the
counter charging, let alone reclaim.
