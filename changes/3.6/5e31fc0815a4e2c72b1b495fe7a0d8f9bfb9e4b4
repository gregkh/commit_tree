    wireless: Save original maximum regulatory transmission power for the calucation of the local maximum transmit pow

changed the way we calculate chan->max_power as min(chan->max_power,
chan->max_reg_power). That broke rt2x00 (and perhaps some other
drivers) that do not set chan->max_power. It is not so easy to fix this
problem correctly in rt2x00.

According to commit eccc068e8 changelog, change claim only to save
maximum regulatory power - changing setting of chan->max_power was side
effect. This patch restore previous calculations of chan->max_power and
do not touch chan->max_reg_power.
