W1: OMAP HDQ1W: allow driver to be built on all OMAP2+

Allow the OMAP HDQ1W driver to be built for all OMAP2+ SoCs by
adjusting KConfig dependencies.  The previous dependency required
either SOC_OMAP2430 or ARCH_OMAP3 to be set, but the HDQ IP block is
present on OMAP2420 and OMAP44xx SoCs.  The driver was still
selectable on multi-OMAP kernel configurations, however; so the
previous prohibition was rather pointless.
