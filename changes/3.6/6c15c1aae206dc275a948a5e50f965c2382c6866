wlcore: queue recovery in case of bus errors during cmd_remove_peer

Following the addition of propagating errors from the bus ops
there's a need to distinguish between bus errors (including timeout)
and a legitimate timeout occuring in cmd_wait_for_event_or_timeout.
In case of real bus errors we need to queue recovery even in cases
where a timeout on a response from the FW to a command is acceptable.
