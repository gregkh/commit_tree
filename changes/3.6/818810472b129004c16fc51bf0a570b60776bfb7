net: Fix references to out-of-scope variables in put_cmsg_compat()

In net/compat.c::put_cmsg_compat() we may assign 'data' the address of
either the 'ctv' or 'cts' local variables inside the 'if
(!COMPAT_USE_64BIT_TIME)' branch.

Those variables go out of scope at the end of the 'if' statement, so
when we use 'data' further down in 'copy_to_user(CMSG_COMPAT_DATA(cm),
data, cmlen - sizeof(struct compat_cmsghdr))' there's no telling what
it may be refering to - not good.

Fix the problem by simply giving 'ctv' and 'cts' function scope.
