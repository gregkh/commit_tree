sched: Improve scalability via 'CPU buddies', which withstand random perturbations

Traversing an entire package is not only expensive, it also leads to tasks
bouncing all over a partially idle and possible quite large package.  Fix
that up by assigning a 'buddy' CPU to try to motivate.  Each buddy may try
to motivate that one other CPU, if it's busy, tough, it may then try its
SMT sibling, but that's all this optimization is allowed to cost.

Sibling cache buddies are cross-wired to prevent bouncing.

4 socket 40 core + SMT Westmere box, single 30 sec tbench runs, higher is better:

A nice increase in performance.
