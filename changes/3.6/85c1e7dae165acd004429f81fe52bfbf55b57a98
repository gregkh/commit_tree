sched: Reorder 'struct lb_env' members to reduce its size

Members of 'struct lb_env' are not in appropriate order to reuse compiler
added padding on 64bit architectures. In this patch we reorder those struct
members and help reduce the size of the structure from 96 bytes to 80
bytes on 64 bit architectures.
