spinlock_debug: print offset in addition to symbol name

If there are two spinlocks embedded in a structure that kallsyms knows
about and one of the spinlocks locks up we will print the name of the
containing structure instead of the address of the lock.  This is quite
bad, so let's use %pS instead of %ps so we get an offset in addition to
the symbol so we can determine which particular lock is having problems.
