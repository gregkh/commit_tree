ALSA: snd-usb: Fix URB cancellation at stream start

Commit e9ba389c5 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Fix scheduling-while-atomic bug in
PCM capture stream") fixed a scheduling-while-atomic bug that happened
when snd_usb_endpoint_start was called from the trigger callback, which
is an atmic context. However, the patch breaks the idea of the endpoints
reference counting, which is the reason why the driver has been
refactored lately.

Revert that commit and let snd_usb_endpoint_start() take care of the URB
cancellation again. As this function is called from both atomic and
non-atomic context, add a flag to denote whether the function may sleep.
