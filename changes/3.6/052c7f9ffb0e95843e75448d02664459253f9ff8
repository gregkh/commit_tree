xhci: Fix a logical vs bitwise AND bug

The intent was to test whether the flag was set.

This patch should be backported to stable kernels as old as 3.0, since
it fixes a bug in commit e95829f474f0db3a4d940cae1423783edd966027 "xhci:
Switch PPT ports to EHCI on shutdown.", which was marked for stable.
