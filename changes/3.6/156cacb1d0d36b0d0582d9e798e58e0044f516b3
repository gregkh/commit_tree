do_add_mount()/umount -l races

normally we deal with lock_mount()/umount races by checking that
mountpoint to be is still in our namespace after lock_mount() has
been done.  However, do_add_mount() skips that check when called
with MNT_SHRINKABLE in flags (i.e. from finish_automount()).  The
reason is that ->mnt_ns may be a temporary namespace created exactly
to contain automounts a-la NFS4 referral handling.  It's not the
namespace of the caller, though, so check_mnt() would fail here.
We still need to check that ->mnt_ns is non-NULL in that case,
though.
