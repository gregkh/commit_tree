GFS2: Add "top dir" flag support

This patch adds support for the "top dir" flag. Currently this is unused
but a subsequent patch is planned which will add support for the
Orlov allocation policy when allocating subdirectories in a parent
with this flag set.

In order to ensure backward compatible behaviour, mkfs.gfs2 does
not currently tag the root directory with this flag, it must always be
set manually.
