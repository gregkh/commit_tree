ARM: 7445/1: mm: update CONTEXTIDR register to contain PID of current process

This patch introduces a new Kconfig option which, when enabled, causes
the kernel to write the PID of the current task into the PROCID field
of the CONTEXTIDR on context switch. This is useful when analysing
hardware trace, since writes to this register can be configured to emit
an event into the trace stream.

The thread notifier for writing the PID is deliberately kept separate
from the ASID-writing code so that we can support newer processors using
LPAE, where the ASID is stored in TTBR0. As such, the switch_mm code is
updated to perform a read-modify-write sequence to ensure that we don't
clobber the PID on CPUs using the classic 2-level page tables.
