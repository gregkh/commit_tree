time: Clean up offs_real/wall_to_mono and offs_boot/total_sleep_time updates

For performance reasons, we maintain ktime_t based duplicates of
wall_to_monotonic (offs_real) and total_sleep_time (offs_boot).

Since large problems could occur (such as the resume regression
on 3.5-rc7, or the leapsecond hrtimer issue) if these value
pairs were to be inconsistently updated, this patch this cleans
up how we modify these value pairs to ensure we are always
consistent.

As a side-effect this is also more efficient as we only
caulculate the duplicate values when they are changed,
rather then every update_wall_time call.

This also provides WARN_ONs to detect if future changes break
the invariants.
