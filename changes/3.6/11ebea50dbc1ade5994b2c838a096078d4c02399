workqueue: separate out worker_pool flags

GCWQ_MANAGE_WORKERS, GCWQ_MANAGING_WORKERS and GCWQ_HIGHPRI_PENDING
are per-pool properties.  Add worker_pool->flags and make the above
three flags per-pool flags.

The changes in this patch are mechanical and don't caues any
functional difference.  This is to prepare for multiple pools per
gcwq.
