rbd: rename rbd_dev->block_name

Each rbd image has a name that forms the basis of all data objects
backing the device.  Old (format 1) images refer to this name as the
"block name," while new (format 2) images use the term "object
prefix" for this.

Change the field name in the in-core rbd image header structure to
reflect the more modern usage.  We intentionally keep the the name
"block_name" in the on-disk definition for format 1 image headers.
