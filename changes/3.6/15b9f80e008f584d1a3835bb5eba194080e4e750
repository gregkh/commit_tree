drm/i915: enable parity error interrupts

The previous patch put all the code, and handlers in place. It should
now be safe to enable the parity error interrupt. The parity error must
be unmasked in both the GTIMR, and the CS IMR. Unfortunately, the docs
aren't clear about this; nevertheless it's the truth.
