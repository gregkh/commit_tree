xen/mce: add .poll method for mcelog device driver

If a driver leaves its poll method NULL, the device is assumed to
be both readable and writable without blocking.

This patch add .poll method to xen mcelog device driver, so that
when mcelog use system calls like ppoll or select, it would be
blocked when no data available, and avoid spinning at CPU.
