ASoC: dmaengine-pcm: Rename and deprecate snd_dmaengine_pcm_pointer

Currently the sound dmaengine pcm helper functions implement the pcm_pointer
callback by trying to count the number of elapsed periods. This is done by
advancing the stream position in the dmaengine callback by one period.
Unfortunately there is no guarantee that the callback will be called for each
elapsed period. It may be possible that under high system load it is only called
once for multiple elapsed periods. This patch renames the current implementation
and documents its shortcomings and that it should not be used anymore in new
drivers.

The next patch will introduce a new snd_dmaengine_pcm_pointer which will be
implemented based on querying the current stream position from the dma device.
