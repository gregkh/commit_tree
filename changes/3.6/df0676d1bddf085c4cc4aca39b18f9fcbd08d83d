ixgbe: Cleanup unpacking code for DCB

This is meant to be a generic clean-up of the remaining functions for
unpacking data from the DCB structures. The only real changes are:
replaced the variable i with tc for functions that were looping through the
traffic classes, and added a pointer for tc_class instead of path since
that way we only need to pull the pointer once instead of once per loop.
