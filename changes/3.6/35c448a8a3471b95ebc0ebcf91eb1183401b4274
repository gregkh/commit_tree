include/net/sock.h: squelch compiler warning in sk_rmem_schedule()

  linux/include/net/sock.h: In function `sk_rmem_schedule':
  linux/nfs-2.6/include/net/sock.h:1339:13: warning: comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions [-Wsign-compare]

is seen with gcc (GCC) 4.6.3 20120306 (Red Hat 4.6.3-2) using the
-Wextra option.

Commit c76562b6709f ("netvm: prevent a stream-specific deadlock")
accidentally replaced the "size" parameter of sk_rmem_schedule() with an
unsigned int.  This changes the semantics of the comparison in the
return statement.

In sk_wmem_schedule we have syntactically the same comparison, but
"size" is a signed integer.  In addition, __sk_mem_schedule() takes a
signed integer for its "size" parameter, so there is an implicit type
conversion in sk_rmem_schedule() anyway.

Revert the "size" parameter back to a signed integer so that the
semantics of the expressions in both sk_[rw]mem_schedule() are exactly
the same.
