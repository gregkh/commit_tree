fuse: mark variables uninitialized

gcc 4.6.3 complains about uninitialized variables in fs/fuse/control.c:

  CC      fs/fuse/control.o
fs/fuse/control.c: In function 'fuse_conn_congestion_threshold_write':
fs/fuse/control.c:165:29: warning: 'val' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
fs/fuse/control.c: In function 'fuse_conn_max_background_write':
fs/fuse/control.c:128:23: warning: 'val' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]

fuse_conn_limit_write() will always return non-zero unless the &val
is modified, so the warning is misleading. Let the compiler know
about it by marking 'val' with 'uninitialized_var'.
