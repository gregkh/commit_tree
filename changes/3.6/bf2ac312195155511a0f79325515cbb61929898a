time: Avoid making adjustments if we haven't accumulated anything

If update_wall_time() is called and the current offset isn't large
enough to accumulate, avoid re-calling timekeeping_adjust which may
change the clock freq and can cause 1ns inconsistencies with
CLOCK_REALTIME_COARSE/CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE.
