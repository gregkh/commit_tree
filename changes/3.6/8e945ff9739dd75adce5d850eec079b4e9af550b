wlcore: don't re-configure wakeup conditions if not needed

suspend and resume callbacks configure wakeup conditions to the FW
which may be different between suspend and resume.
This feature is currently not utilized as both in suspend and resume
FW wakeup every 1 DTIM. Avoid waking up the chip and doing the FW command
unless there's an actual difference in the wakeup conditions.
