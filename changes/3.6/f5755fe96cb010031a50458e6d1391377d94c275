wl18xx: PG2.0 HW Watch dog interrupt support

In PG2, the HW watchdog interrupt occupies bit0 of the event vector, and
the SW watchdog is relocated to bit9. We perform the relocation
globally, as there's only one watchdog bit on previous platforms (bit0).

[Only mask in the new bit9 for platforms supporting it. This avoids
spurious events on other platforms - Arik]
