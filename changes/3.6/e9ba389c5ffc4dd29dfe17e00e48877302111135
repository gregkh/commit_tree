ALSA: usb-audio: Fix scheduling-while-atomic bug in PCM capture stream

A PCM capture stream on usb-audio causes a scheduling-while-atomic
BUG, as reported in the bugzilla entry below.  It's because
snd_usb_endpoint_start() is called at first at trigger START for a
capture stream, and this function contains the left-over EP
deactivation codes.  The problem doesn't happen for a playback stream
because the function is called at PCM prepare time, which can sleep.

This patch fixes the BUG by moving the EP deactivation code into the
PCM prepare callback.
