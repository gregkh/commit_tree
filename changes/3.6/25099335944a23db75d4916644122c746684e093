mISDN: Bugfix for layer2 fixed TEI mode

If a fixed TEI is used, the initial state of the layer 2 statmachine need to be
4 (TEI assigned). This was true only for Point to Point connections, but not
for the other fixed TEIs. It was not found before, because usually only the
TEI 0 is used as fixed TEI for PtP mode, but if you try X31 packet mode
connections with SAPI 16, TEI 1, it did fail.
