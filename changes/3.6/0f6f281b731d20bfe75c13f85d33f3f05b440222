s390/mm: downgrade page table after fork of a 31 bit process

The downgrade of the 4 level page table created by init_new_context is
currently done only in start_thread31. If a 31 bit process forks the
new mm uses a 4 level page table, including the task size of 2<<42
that goes along with it. This is incorrect as now a 31 bit process
can map memory beyond 2GB. Define arch_dup_mmap to do the downgrade
after fork.
