drivers: net: irda: bfin_sir: fix compile error

Bit IREN is replaced by UMOD_IRDA and UMOD_MASK since blackfin 60x added, but
this driver didn't update which will cause bfin_sir build error:

drivers/net/irda/bfin_sir.c:161:9: error: 'IREN' undeclared (first use in this
function)
drivers/net/irda/bfin_sir.c:435:18: error: 'IREN' undeclared (first use in
this function)
drivers/net/irda/bfin_sir.c:521:11: error: 'IREN' undeclared (first use in
this function)

This patch fix it.
