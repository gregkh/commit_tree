bcma: remove fix for 4329b0 bad LPOM is detection

There is not core id with 0x4329, but at the same place in the open
source part of the Broadcom SDK is a check for some device with the
chip id of 0x4329. The device with a chip id of 0x4329 is a full mac
device, so it will never be supported by bcma, this part is running in
the firmware of the device and not on the host CPU.
This code is wrong and will never be used, so just remove it.
