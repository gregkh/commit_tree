dma: sh: use an integer slave ID to improve API compatibility

Initially struct shdma_slave has been introduced with the only member - an
unsigned slave ID - to describe common properties of DMA slaves in an
extensible way. However, experience shows, that a slave ID is indeed the
only parameter, needed to identify DMA slaves. This is also, what is used
by the core dmaengine API in struct dma_slave_config. We switch to using
the slave_id directly, instead of passing a pointer to struct shdma_slave
to improve compatibility with the core. We also make the slave_id signed
for easier error checking.
