uprobes: __replace_page() needs munlock_vma_page()

Like do_wp_page(), __replace_page() should do munlock_vma_page()
for the case when the old page still has other !VM_LOCKED
mappings. Unfortunately this needs mm/internal.h.

Also, move put_page() outside of ptl lock. This doesn't really
matter but looks a bit better.
