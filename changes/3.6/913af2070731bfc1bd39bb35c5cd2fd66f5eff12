irqdomain: Split disassociating code into separate function

This patch moves the irq disassociation code out into a separate
function in preparation to extend irq_setup_virq to handle multiple
irqs and rename it for use by interrupt controller drivers.  The new
function will be used by irq_setup_virq() in its error path.
