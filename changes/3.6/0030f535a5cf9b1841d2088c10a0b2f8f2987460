mm: memcg: fix compaction/migration failing due to memcg limits

Compaction (and page migration in general) can currently be hindered
through pages being owned by memory cgroups that are at their limits and
unreclaimable.

The reason is that the replacement page is being charged against the limit
while the page being replaced is also still charged.  But this seems
unnecessary, given that only one of the two pages will still be in use
after migration finishes.

This patch changes the memcg migration sequence so that the replacement
page is not charged.  Whatever page is still in use after successful or
failed migration gets to keep the charge of the page that was going to be
replaced.

The replacement page will still show up temporarily in the rss/cache
statistics, this can be fixed in a later patch as it's less urgent.
