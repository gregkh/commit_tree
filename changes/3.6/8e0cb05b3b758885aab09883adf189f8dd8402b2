pwm: pwm-tiecap: PWM driver support for ECAP APWM

ECAP hardware on AM33XX SOC supports auxiliary PWM (APWM) feature. This
commit adds PWM driver support for ECAP hardware on AM33XX SOC.

In the ECAP hardware, each PWM pin can also be configured to be in
capture mode. Current implementation only supports PWM mode of
operation. Also, hardware supports sync between multiple PWM pins but
the driver supports simple independent PWM functionality.
