x86/debug: Add KERN_<LEVEL> to bare printks, convert printks to pr_<level>

Use a more current logging style:

 - Bare printks should have a KERN_<LEVEL> for consistency's sake
 - Add pr_fmt where appropriate
 - Neaten some macro definitions
 - Convert some Ok output to OK
 - Use "%s: ", __func__ in pr_fmt for summit
 - Convert some printks to pr_<level>

Message output is not identical in all cases.
