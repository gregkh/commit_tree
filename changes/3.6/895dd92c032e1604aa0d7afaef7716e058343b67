sched: Deliver sched_switch events to the current task

Otherwise they can't be filtered for a defined task:

  perf record -e sched:sched_switch ./foo

This command doesn't report any events without this patch.

I think it isn't a security concern if someone knows who will
be executed next - this can already be observed by polling /proc
state. By default perf is disabled for non-root users in any case.

I need these events for profiling sleep times.  sched_switch is used for
getting callchains and sched_stat_* is used for getting time periods.
These events are combined in user space, then it can be analyzed by
perf tools.
