USB: EHCI: use hrtimer for interrupt QH unlink

This patch (as1577) adds hrtimer support for unlinking interrupt QHs
in ehci-hcd.  The current code relies on a fixed delay of either 2 or
55 us, which is not always adequate and in any case is totally bogus.
Thanks to internal caching, the EHCI hardware may continue to access
an interrupt QH for more than a millisecond after it has been unlinked.

In fact, the EHCI spec doesn't say how long to wait before using an
unlinked interrupt QH.  The patch sets the delay to 9 microframes
minimum, which ought to be adequate.
