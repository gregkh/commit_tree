ipv6: add ipv6_addr_hash() helper

Introduce ipv6_addr_hash() helper doing a XOR on all bits
of an IPv6 address, with an optimized x86_64 version.

Use it in flow dissector, as suggested by Andrew McGregor,
to reduce hash collision probabilities in fq_codel (and other
users of flow dissector)

Use it in ip6_tunnel.c and use more bit shuffling, as suggested
by David Laight, as existing hash was ignoring most of them.

Use it in sunrpc and use more bit shuffling, using hash_32().

Use it in net/ipv6/addrconf.c, using hash_32() as well.

As a cleanup, use it in net/ipv4/tcp_metrics.c
