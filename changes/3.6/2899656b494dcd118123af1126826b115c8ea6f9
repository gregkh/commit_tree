netpoll: take rcu_read_lock_bh() in netpoll_send_skb_on_dev()

This patch fixes several problems in the call path of
netpoll_send_skb_on_dev():

1. Disable IRQ's before calling netpoll_send_skb_on_dev().

2. All the callees of netpoll_send_skb_on_dev() should use
   rcu_dereference_bh() to dereference ->npinfo.

3. Rename arp_reply() to netpoll_arp_reply(), the former is too generic.
