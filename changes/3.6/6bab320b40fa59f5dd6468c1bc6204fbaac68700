staging: wlags49_h2: remove vi modelines

Opening drivers/staging/wlags49_h2/dhf.h with vim triggered this
warning:
"drivers/staging/wlags49_h2/dhf.h" 226L, 8428C
Error detected while processing modelines:
line    2:
E518: Unknown option: */
Press ENTER or type command to continue

Since the Linux kernel coding style disallows modelines this invalid
modeline can simply be removed. And since we're touching this file we
might as well remove all vim modelines from this driver.

vim tested only.
