[SCSI] Remove scsi_wait_scan module

scsi_wait_scan was introduced with asynchronous host scanning as a hack
for distributions that weren't using proper udev based wait for root to
appear in their initramfs scripts.  In 2.6.30 Commit

    PM/Hibernate: Wait for SCSI devices scan to complete during resume

Actually broke scsi_wait_scan because it renders
scsi_complete_async_scans() a nop for modular SCSI if you include
scsi_scans.h (which this module does).

The lack of bug reports is sufficient proof that this module is no
longer used.
