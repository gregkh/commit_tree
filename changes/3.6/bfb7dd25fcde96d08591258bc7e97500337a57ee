ARM: OMAP3xxx: clockdomain: fix software supervised wakeup/sleep

Commit 4da71ae6 ("OMAP: clockdomain: Arch specific funcs for
clkdm_clk_enable/disable") called the OMAP2xxx-specific functions for
clockdomain wakeup and sleep.  This would probably have broken
software-supervised clockdomain wakeup and sleep on OMAP3.
