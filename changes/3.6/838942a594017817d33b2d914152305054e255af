ipv4: Really ignore ICMP address requests/replies.

Alexey removed kernel side support for requests, and the
only thing we do for replies is log a message if something
doesn't look right.

As Alexey's comment indicates, this belongs in userspace (if
anywhere), and thus we can safely just get rid of this code.
