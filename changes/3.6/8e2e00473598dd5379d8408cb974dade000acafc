GFS2: Reduce file fragmentation

This patch reduces GFS2 file fragmentation by pre-reserving blocks. The
resulting improved on disk layout greatly speeds up operations in cases
which would have resulted in interlaced allocation of blocks previously.
A typical example of this is 10 parallel dd processes, each writing to a
file in a common dirctory.

The implementation uses an rbtree of reservations attached to each
resource group (and each inode).
