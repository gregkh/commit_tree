pstore/ram_core: Better ECC size checking

- Instead of exploiting unsigned overflows (which doesn't work for all
  sizes), use straightforward checking for ECC total size not exceeding
  initial buffer size;

- Printing overflowed buffer_size is not informative. Instead, print
  ecc_size and buffer_size;

- No need for buffer_size argument in persistent_ram_init_ecc(),
  we can address prz->buffer_size directly.
