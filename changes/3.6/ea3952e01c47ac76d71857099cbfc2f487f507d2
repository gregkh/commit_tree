MIPS: JZ4740: reset: Initialize hibernate wakeup counters.

In hibernation mode only the wakeup logic and the RTC are left running,
so this is what users perceive as power down.

If the counters are not initialized, the corresponding pin (typically
connected to the power button) has to be asserted for two seconds
before the device wakes up. Most users expect a shorter wakeup time.

I took the timing values of 100 ms and 60 ms from BouKiCHi's patch for
the Dingoo A320 kernel.
