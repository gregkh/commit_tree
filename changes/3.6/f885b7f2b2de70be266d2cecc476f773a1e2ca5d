rcu: Control RCU_FANOUT_LEAF from boot-time parameter

Although making RCU_FANOUT_LEAF a kernel configuration parameter rather
than a fixed constant makes it easier for people to decrease cache-miss
overhead for large systems, it is of little help for people who must
run a single pre-built kernel binary.

This commit therefore allows the value of RCU_FANOUT_LEAF to be
increased (but not decreased!) via a boot-time parameter named
rcutree.rcu_fanout_leaf.
