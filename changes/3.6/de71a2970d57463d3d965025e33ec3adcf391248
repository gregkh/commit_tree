rbd: rename rbd_device->id

The "id" field of an rbd device structure represents the unique
client-local device id mapped to the underlying rbd image.  Each rbd
image will have another id--the image id--and each snapshot has its
own id as well.  The simple name "id" no longer conveys the
information one might like to have.

Rename the device "id" field in struct rbd_dev to be "dev_id" to
make it a little more obvious what we're dealing with without having
to think more about context.
