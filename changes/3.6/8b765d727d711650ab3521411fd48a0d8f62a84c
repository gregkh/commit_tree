ARM: OMAP2+: smartreflex: Use the names from hwmod data instead of voltage domains.

Associate a name with each SmartReflex instance from the hwmod data,
rather than attempting to reuse the name of a voltage domain. The name
from hwmod better reflects the smartreflex integration in the system.

Also have the name passed to the drivers using pdata, which helps to remove
any dependencies on SoC-specific structures.
