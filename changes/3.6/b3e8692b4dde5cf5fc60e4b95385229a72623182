audit: clean up refcounting in audit-tree

Drop the initial reference by fsnotify_init_mark early instead of
audit_tree_freeing_mark() at destroy time.

In the cases we destroy the mark before we drop the initial reference we need to
get rid of the get_mark that balances the put_mark in audit_tree_freeing_mark().
