mmc: dw_mmc: Disable low power mode if SDIO interrupts are used

The documentation for the dw_mmc part says that the low power
mode should normally only be set for MMC and SD memory and should
be turned off for SDIO cards that need interrupts detected.

The best place I could find to do this is when the SDIO interrupt
was first enabled.  I rely on the fact that dw_mci_setup_bus()
will be called when it's time to reenable.
