blkcg: __blkg_lookup_create() doesn't need radix preload

There's no point in calling radix_tree_preload() if preloading doesn't
use more permissible GFP mask.  Drop preloading from
__blkg_lookup_create().

While at it, drop sparse locking annotation which no longer applies.

v2: Vivek pointed out the odd preload usage.  Instead of updating,
    just drop it.
