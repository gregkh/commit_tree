PM: Make dev_pm_get_subsys_data() always return 0 on success

Commits 1d5fcfec22 (PM / Domains: Add device domain data reference
counter) and 62d4490294 (PM / Domains: Allow device callbacks to be
added at any time) added checks for the return value of
dev_pm_get_subsys_data(), but those checks were incorrect, because
that function returned 1 on success in some cases.

Since all of the existing users of dev_pm_get_subsys_data() don't use
the positive value returned by it on success, change its definition
so that it always returns 0 when successful.
