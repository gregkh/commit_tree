pstore/ram: Probe as early as possible

Registering the platform driver before module_init allows us to log oopses
that happen during device probing.

This requires changing module_init to postcore_initcall, and switching
from platform_driver_probe to platform_driver_register because the
platform device is not registered when the platform driver is registered;
and because we use driver_register, now can't use create_bundle() (since
it will try to register the same driver once again), so we have to switch
to platform_device_register_data().

Also, some __init -> __devinit changes were needed.

Overall, the registration logic is now much clearer, since we have only
one driver registration point, and just an optional dummy device, which
is created from the module parameters.
