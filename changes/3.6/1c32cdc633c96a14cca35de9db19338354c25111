xen/x86: avoid updating TLS descriptors if they haven't changed

When switching tasks in a Xen PV guest, avoid updating the TLS
descriptors if they haven't changed.  This improves the speed of
context switches by almost 10% as much of the time the descriptors are
the same or only one is different.

The descriptors written into the GDT by Xen are modified from the
values passed in the update_descriptor hypercall so we keep shadow
copies of the three TLS descriptors to compare against.
