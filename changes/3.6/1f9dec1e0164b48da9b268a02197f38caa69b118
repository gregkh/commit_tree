HID: uhid: allow poll()'ing on uhid devices

As long as the internal buffer is not empty, we return POLLIN to
user-space.

uhid->head and uhid->tail are no atomics so the comparison may return
inexact results. However, this doesn't matter here as user-space would
need to poll() in two threads simultaneously to trigger this. And in this
case it doesn't matter if a cached result is returned or the exact new
result as user-space does not know which thread returns first from poll()
and the following read(). So it is safe to compare the values without
locking.
