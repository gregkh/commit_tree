net/stmmac: mark probe function as __devinit

Driver probe functions are generally __devinit so they will be
discarded after initialization for non-hotplug kernels.
This was found by a new warning after patch 6a228452d "stmmac: Add
device-tree support" adds a new __devinit function that is called
from stmmac_pltfr_probe.

Without this patch, building socfpga_defconfig results in:

WARNING: drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/stmmac.o(.text+0x5d4c): Section mismatch in reference from the function stmmac_pltfr_probe() to the function .devinit.text:stmmac_probe_config_dt()
The function stmmac_pltfr_probe() references
the function __devinit stmmac_probe_config_dt().
This is often because stmmac_pltfr_probe lacks a __devinit
annotation or the annotation of stmmac_probe_config_dt is wrong.
