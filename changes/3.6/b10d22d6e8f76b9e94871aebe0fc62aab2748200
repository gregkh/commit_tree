kernel/debug: Make use of KGDB_REASON_NMI

Currently kernel never set KGDB_REASON_NMI. We do now, when we enter
KGDB/KDB from an NMI.

This is not to be confused with kgdb_nmicallback(), NMI callback is
an entry for the slave CPUs during CPUs roundup, but REASON_NMI is the
entry for the master CPU.
