PCI: add infrastructure for devices with broken INTx masking

pci_intx_mask_supported() assumes INTx masking is supported if the
PCI_COMMAND_INTX_DISABLE bit is writable.  But when that bit is set,
some devices don't actually mask INTx or update PCI_STATUS_INTERRUPT
as we expect.

This patch adds a way for quirks to identify these broken devices.
