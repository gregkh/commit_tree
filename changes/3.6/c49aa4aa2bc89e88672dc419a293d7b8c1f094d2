brcmsmac: fix NULL pointer crash in brcms_c_regd_init()

In the function brcms_c_regd_init() the channels are validated
against the device capabilities. This is done for both 2.4G and
5G band, but there are devices that are 2.4G only, ie. BCM4313.
For that device this leads to a NULL dereference. This patch adds
a check in brcms_c_regd_init() to fix this.
