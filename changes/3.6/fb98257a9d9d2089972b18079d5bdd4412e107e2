drm/radeon: apply Murphy's law to the kms irq code v3

1. It is really dangerous to have more than one
   spinlock protecting the same information.

2. radeon_irq_set sometimes wasn't called with lock
   protection, so it can happen that more than one
   CPU would tamper with the irq regs at the same
   time.

3. The pm.gui_idle variable was assuming that the 3D
   engine wasn't becoming idle between testing the
   register and setting the variable. So just remove
   it and test the register directly.

v2: Also handle the hpd irq code the same way.
v3: Rename hpd parameter for clarification.
