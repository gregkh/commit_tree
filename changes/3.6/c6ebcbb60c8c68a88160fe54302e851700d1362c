rcu: Fix bug in rcu_barrier() torture test

The child threads in the rcu_torture_barrier_cbs() are improperly
synchronized, which can cause the rcu_barrier() tests to hang.  The
failure mode is as follows:

1.	CPU 0 running in rcu_torture_barrier() sets barrier_cbs_count
    	to n_barrier_cbs.

2.	CPU 1 running in rcu_torture_barrier_cbs() wakes up, posts
    	its RCU callback, and atomically decrements barrier_cbs_count.
    	Because barrier_cbs_count is not zero, it does not do the wake_up().

3.	CPU 2 running in rcu_torture_barrier_cbs() wakes up, but
    	finds that barrier_cbs_count is not equal to n_barrier_cbs,
    	and so returns to sleep.

4.	The value of barrier_cbs_count therefore never reaches zero,
    	which causes the test to hang.

This commit therefore uses a phase variable to coordinate the test,
preventing this scenario from occurring.
