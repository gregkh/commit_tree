rcu: Move _rcu_barrier()'s rcu_head structures to rcu_data structures

In order for multiple flavors of RCU to each concurrently run one
rcu_barrier(), each flavor needs its own per-CPU set of rcu_head
structures.  This commit therefore moves _rcu_barrier()'s set of
per-CPU rcu_head structures from per-CPU variables to the existing
per-CPU and per-RCU-flavor rcu_data structures.
