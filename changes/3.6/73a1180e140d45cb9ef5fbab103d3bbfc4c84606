mm: Fix build warning in kmem_cache_create()

The label oops is used in CONFIG_DEBUG_VM ifdef block and is defined
outside ifdef CONFIG_DEBUG_VM block. This results in the following
build warning when built with CONFIG_DEBUG_VM disabled. Fix to move
label oops definition to inside a CONFIG_DEBUG_VM block.

mm/slab_common.c: In function ‘kmem_cache_create’:
mm/slab_common.c:101:1: warning: label ‘oops’ defined but not used
[-Wunused-label]
