drm/i915: Add comments to explain the BSD tail write workaround

Having had to dive into the bspec to understand what each stage of the
workaround meant, and how that the ring broadcasting IDLE corresponded
with the GT powering down the ring (i.e. rc6) add comments to aide
the next reader.

And since the register "is used to control all aspects of PSMI and power
saving functions" that makes it quite interesting to inspect with
regards to RC6 hangs, so add it to the error-state.

v2: Rediscover the piece of magic, set the RNCID to 0 before waiting for
the ring to wake up.
