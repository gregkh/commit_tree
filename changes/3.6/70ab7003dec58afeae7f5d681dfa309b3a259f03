perf/x86: Don't assume there can be only 4 PEBS events

On Sandy Bridge in non HT mode there are 8 counters available.
Since every counter can write a PEBS record assuming there are
4 max is incorrect. Use the reported counter number -- with an
upper limit for a static array -- instead.

Also I made the warning messages a bit more informational.
