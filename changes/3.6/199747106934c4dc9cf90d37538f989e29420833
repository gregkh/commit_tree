edac: add a new per-dimm API and make the old per-virtual-rank API obsolete

The old EDAC API is broken. It only works fine for systems manufatured
before 2005 and for AMD 64. The reason is that it forces all memory
controller drivers to discover rank info.

Also, it doesn't allow grouping the several ranks into a DIMM.

So, what almost all modern drivers do is to create a fake virtual-rank
information, and use it to cheat the EDAC core to accept the driver.

While this works if the user has enough time to discover what DIMM slot
corresponds to each "virtual-rank" information, it prevents EDAC usage
for users with less available time. It also makes life hard for vendors
that may want to provide a table with their motherboards to the userspace
tool (edac-utils) as each driver has its own logic for the virtual
mapping.

So, the old API should be removed, in favor of a more flexible API that
allows newer drivers to not lie to the EDAC core.
