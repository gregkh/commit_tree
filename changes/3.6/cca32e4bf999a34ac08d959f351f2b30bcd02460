net: TCP early demux cleanup

early_demux() handlers should be called in RCU context, and as we
use skb_dst_set_noref(skb, dst), caller must not exit from RCU context
before dst use (skb_dst(skb)) or release (skb_drop(dst))

Therefore, rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock() pairs around
->early_demux() are confusing and not needed :

Protocol handlers are already in an RCU read lock section.
(__netif_receive_skb() does the rcu_read_lock() )
