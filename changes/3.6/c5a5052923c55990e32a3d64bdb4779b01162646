apple-gmux: Fix index read functions

Study of Apple's binary driver revealed that the GMUX_READ_PORT should
be written between calls to gmux_index_wait_ready and
gmux_index_wait_complete (i.e., the new index protocol must be
followed). If this is not done correctly, the indexed
gmux device only partially accepts writes which lead to problems
concerning GPU switching. Special thanks to Seth Forshee who helped
greatly with identifying unnecessary changes.
