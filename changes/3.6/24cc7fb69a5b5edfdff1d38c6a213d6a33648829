x86/kbuild: archscripts depends on scripts_basic

While building the SUSE kernel packages, which build the scripts,
make clean, and then build everything, we have been running into spurious
build failures. We tracked them down to a simple dependency issue:

$ make mrproper
  CLEAN   arch/x86/tools
  CLEAN   scripts/basic
$ cp patches/config/x86_64/desktop .config
$ make archscripts
  HOSTCC  arch/x86/tools/relocs
/bin/sh: scripts/basic/fixdep: No such file or directory
make[3]: *** [arch/x86/tools/relocs] Error 1
make[2]: *** [archscripts] Error 2
make[1]: *** [sub-make] Error 2
make: *** [all] Error 2

This was introduced by commit
6520fe55 (x86, realmode: 16-bit real-mode code support for relocs),
which added the archscripts dependency to archprepare.

This patch adds the scripts_basic dependency to the x86 archscripts.
