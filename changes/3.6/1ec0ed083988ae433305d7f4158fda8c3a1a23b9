[media] v4l: Remove "_ACTUAL" from subdev selection API target definition names

The string "_ACTUAL" does not say anything more about the target names. Drop
it. V4L2 selection API was changed by "V4L: Remove "_ACTIVE" from the
selection target name definitions" by Sylwester Nawrocki. This patch does
the same for the V4L2 subdev API.
