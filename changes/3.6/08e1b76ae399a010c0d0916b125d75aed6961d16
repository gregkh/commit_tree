ima: use full pathnames in measurement list

The IMA measurement list contains filename hints, which can be
ambigious without the full pathname.  This patch replaces the
filename hint with the full pathname, simplifying for userspace
the correlating of file hash measurements with files.

Change log v1:
- Revert to short filenames, when full pathname is longer than IMA
  measurement buffer size. (Based on Dmitry's review)
