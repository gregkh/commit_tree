powerpc: Put the gpr save/restore functions in their own section

This allows the linker to know that calls to them do not need to switch
TOC and stop errors like the following when linking large configurations:

powerpc64-linux-ld: drivers/built-in.o: In function `.gpiochip_is_requested':
(.text+0x4): sibling call optimization to `_savegpr0_29' does not allow automatic multiple TOCs; recompile with -mminimal-toc or -fno-optimize-sibling-calls, or make `_savegpr0_29' extern
