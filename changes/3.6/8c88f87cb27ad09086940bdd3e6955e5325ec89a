netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: add NAT TCP sequence adjustment if packet mangled

User-space programs that receive traffic via NFQUEUE may mangle packets.
If NAT is enabled, this usually puzzles sequence tracking, leading to
traffic disruptions.

With this patch, nfnl_queue will make the corresponding NAT TCP sequence
adjustment if:

1) The packet has been mangled,
2) the NFQA_CFG_F_CONNTRACK flag has been set, and
3) NAT is detected.

There are some records on the Internet complaning about this issue:

By now, we only support TCP since we have no helpers for DCCP or SCTP.
Better to add this if we ever have some helper over those layer 4 protocols.
