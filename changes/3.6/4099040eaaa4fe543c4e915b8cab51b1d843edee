[media] videobuf-dma-contig: restore buffer mapping for uncached bufers

from commit a8f3c203e19b702fa5e8e83a9b6fb3c5a6d1cce4
restore the mapping scheme for uncached buffers,
which was changed in a common scheme for cached and uncached.
This apparently was wrong, and was probably intended only for cached buffers.
the fix fixes the crash observed while mapping uncached buffers.
