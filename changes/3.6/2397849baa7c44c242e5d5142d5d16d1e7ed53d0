[PATCH] tcp: Cache inetpeer in timewait socket, and only when necessary.

Since it's guarenteed that we will access the inetpeer if we're trying
to do timewait recycling and TCP options were enabled on the
connection, just cache the peer in the timewait socket.

In the future, inetpeer lookups will be context dependent (per routing
realm), and this helps facilitate that as well.
