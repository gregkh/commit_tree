Bluetooth: Update l2cap_send_i_or_rr_or_rnr to fit the spec better

This action now exactly matches what is defined in the ERTM
specification, including clearing the remote busy flag and setting the
retransmit timer rather than retransmitting frames directly.  The spec
does not retransmit frames as part of this action, since
retransmission is only triggered by REJ, SREJ, or an RR with the final
bit set.  struct l2cap_ctrl is also used to set up header values.
