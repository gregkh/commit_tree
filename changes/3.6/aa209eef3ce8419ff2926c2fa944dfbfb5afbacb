staging: vt6656: [BUG] - Failed connection, incorrect endian.

Hi,

This patch fixes a bug with driver failing to negotiate a connection.

The bug was traced to commit
203e4615ee9d9fa8d3506b9d0ef30095e4d5bc90
staging: vt6656: removed custom definitions of Ethernet packet types

In that patch, definitions in include/linux/if_ether.h replaced ones
in tether.h which had both big and little endian definitions.

include/linux/if_ether.h only refers to big endian values, cpu_to_be16
should be used for the correct endian architectures.
