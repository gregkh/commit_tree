net: add support for NS8390 based eth controllers on some ColdFire CPU boards

A number of older ColdFire CPU based boards use NS8390 based network
controllers. Most use the Davicom 9008F or the UMC 9008F. This driver
provides the support code to get these devices working on these platforms.

Generally the NS8390 based eth device is direct connected via the general
purpose bus of the ColdFire CPU. So its addressing and interrupt setup is
fixed on each of the different platforms (classic platform setup).

This driver is based on the other drivers/net/ethernet/8390 drivers, and
includes the lib8390.c code. It uses the existing definitions of the
board NS8390 device addresses, interrupts and access types from the
arch/m68k/include/asm/mcf8390.h, but moves the IO access functions into
the driver code and out of that header.
