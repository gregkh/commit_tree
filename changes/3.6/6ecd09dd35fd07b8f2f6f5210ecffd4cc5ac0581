net: ftgmac100/ftmac100: dont pull too much data

Drivers should pull only ethernet header from page frag
to skb->head.

Pulling 64 bytes is too much for TCP (without options) on IPv4.

However, it makes sense to pull all the frame if it fits the
128 bytes bloc allocated for skb->head, to free one page per
small incoming frame.
