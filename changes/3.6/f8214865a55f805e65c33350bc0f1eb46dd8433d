batman-adv: Add get_ethtool_stats() support

Added additional counters in a bat_stats structure, which are exported
through the ethtool api. The counters are specific to batman-adv and
includes:
 forwarded packets and bytes
 management packets and bytes (aggregated OGMs at this point)
 translation table packets

New counters are added by extending "enum bat_counters" in types.h and
adding corresponding  descriptive string(s) to bat_counters_strings in
soft-iface.c.

Counters are increased by calling batadv_add_counter() and incremented
by one by calling batadv_inc_counter().
