gpio/omap: move bank->dbck initialization to omap_gpio_mod_init()

Since the bank->dbck initialization in a one time operation there
is no need to keep this within gpio_debounce(). Therefore, moving
clk_get(bank->dbck) to omap_gpio_mod_init(). Since the value of
bank->dbck would be NULL at the beginning, this check has been
removed.
