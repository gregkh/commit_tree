inet: Hide route peer accesses behind helpers.

We encode the pointer(s) into an unsigned long with one state bit.

The state bit is used so we can store the inetpeer tree root to use
when resolving the peer later.

Later the peer roots will be per-FIB table, and this change works to
facilitate that.
