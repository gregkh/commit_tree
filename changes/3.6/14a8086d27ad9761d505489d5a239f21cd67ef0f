i2c-piix4: Eliminate piix4_smba global variable

Some chipsets have multiple sets of piix4-compatible SMBus registers.
Eliminating the global variable will allow these chipsets to be fully
supported.

Return value from piix4_setup and piix4_sb800_setup now returns the smba
value detected. This is stored in a struct i2c_piix4_adapdata. Thus
the global variable is eliminated.
