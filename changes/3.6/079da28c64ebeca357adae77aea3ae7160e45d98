xfs: fix allocbt cursor leak in xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_near

When we fail to find an matching extent near the requested extent
specification during a left-right distance search in
xfs_alloc_ag_vextent_near, we fail to free the original cursor that
we used to look up the XFS_BTNUM_CNT tree and hence leak it.
