dm crypt: store crypt_config instead of dm_target struct

Store the crypt_config struct pointer directly in struct dm_crypt_io
instead of the dm_target struct pointer.

Target information is never used - only target->private is referenced,
thus we can change it to point directly to struct crypt_config.
