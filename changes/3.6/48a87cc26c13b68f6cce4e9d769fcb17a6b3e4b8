net: netprio: fd passed in SCM_RIGHTS datagram not set correctly

A socket fd passed in a SCM_RIGHTS datagram was not getting
updated with the new tasks cgrp prioidx. This leaves IO on
the socket tagged with the old tasks priority.

To fix this add a check in the scm recvmsg path to update the
sock cgrp prioidx with the new tasks value.

Thanks to Al Viro for catching this.
