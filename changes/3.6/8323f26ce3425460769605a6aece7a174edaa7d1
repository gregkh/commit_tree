sched: Fix race in task_group()

Stefan reported a crash on a kernel before a3e5d1091c1 ("sched:
Don't call task_group() too many times in set_task_rq()"), he
found the reason to be that the multiple task_group()
invocations in set_task_rq() returned different values.

Looking at all that I found a lack of serialization and plain
wrong comments.

The below tries to fix it using an extra pointer which is
updated under the appropriate scheduler locks. Its not pretty,
but I can't really see another way given how all the cgroup
stuff works.
