qnx4fs: use memweight()

Use memweight() to count the total number of bits clear in memory area.

Note that this memweight() call can't be replaced with a single
bitmap_weight() call, although the pointer to the memory area is aligned
to long-word boundary.  Because the size of the memory area may not be a
multiple of BITS_PER_LONG, then it returns wrong value on big-endian
architecture.
