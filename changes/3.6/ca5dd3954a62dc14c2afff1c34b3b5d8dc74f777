powerpc: Fix xmon dl command for new printk implementation

Since the printk internals were reworked the xmon 'dl' command which
dumps the content of __log_buf has stopped working.

It is now a structured buffer, so just dumping it doesn't really work.

Use the helpers added for kgdb to print out the content.
