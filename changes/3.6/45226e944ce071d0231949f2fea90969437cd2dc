NMI watchdog: fix for lockup detector breakage on resume

On the suspend/resume path the boot CPU does not go though an
offline->online transition.  This breaks the NMI detector post-resume
since it depends on PMU state that is lost when the system gets
suspended.

Fix this by forcing a CPU offline->online transition for the lockup
detector on the boot CPU during resume.

To provide more context, we enable NMI watchdog on Chrome OS.  We have
seen several reports of systems freezing up completely which indicated
that the NMI watchdog was not firing for some reason.

Debugging further, we found a simple way of repro'ing system freezes --
issuing the command 'tasket 1 sh -c "echo nmilockup > /proc/breakme"'
after the system has been suspended/resumed one or more times.

With this patch in place, the system freeze result in panics, as
expected.

These panics provide a nice stack trace for us to debug the actual issue
causing the freeze.
