ARM: OMAP2+: am33xx: Make am33xx as a separate class

Initially, we decided to make am33xx family of device to fall
under omap3 class (cpu_is_omap34xx() = true), since it carries
Cortex-A8 core. But while adding complete baseport support
(like, clock, power and hwmod) support, it is observed that,
we are creating more and more problems by treating am33xx device
as omap3 family, as nothing matches between them
(except cortex-A8 mpu).

So,  after long discussion we have came to the conclusion that,
we should not consider am33xx device as omap3 family, instead
create separate class (SOC_AM33XX) under OMAP2PLUS.
This means, for am33xx device, cpu_is_omap34xx() will return false,
and only cpu_is_am33xx() will be true.
