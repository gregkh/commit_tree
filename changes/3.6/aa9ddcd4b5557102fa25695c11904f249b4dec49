Btrfs: do not use missing devices when showing devname

If you do the following

mkfs.btrfs /dev/sdb /dev/sdc
rmmod btrfs
dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sdb bs=1M count=1
mount -o degraded /dev/sdc /mnt/btrfs-test

the box will panic trying to deref the name for the missing dev since it is
the lower numbered devid.  So fix show_devname to not use missing devices.
