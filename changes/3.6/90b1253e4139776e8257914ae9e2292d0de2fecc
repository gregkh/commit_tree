vfio: get rid of vfio_device_put()/vfio_group_get_device* races

we really need to make sure that dropping the last reference happens
under the group->device_lock; otherwise a loop (under device_lock)
might find vfio_device instance that is being freed right now, has
already dropped the last reference and waits on device_lock to exclude
the sucker from the list.
