rbd: more symbol renames

Rename variables named "obj" which represent object names so they're
consistently named "object_name".

Rename the "cls" and "method" parameters in rbd_req_sync_exec()
to be "class_name" and "method_name", and make similar changes
to the names of local variables in that function representing
the lengths of those names.
