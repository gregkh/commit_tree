mmc: core: Fix the HPI execution sequence

mmc_execute_hpi should send the HPI command only once, and only
if the card is in PRG state.

According to eMMC spec, the command's completion time is
not dependent on OUT_OF_INTERRUPT_TIME. Only the transition
out of PRG STATE is guarded by OUT_OF_INTERRUPT_TIME - which
is defined to begin at the end of sending the command itself.

Specify the default timeout for the actual sending of HPI
command, and then use OUT_OF_INTERRUPT_TIME to wait for
the transition out of PRG state.
