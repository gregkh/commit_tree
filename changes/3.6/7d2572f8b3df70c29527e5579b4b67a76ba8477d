OMAPDSS: DSI: Configure dss_lcd_mgr_config struct with lcd manager parameters

Create a dss_lcd_mgr_config struct instance in DSI. Fill up all the parameters
of the struct with configurations held by the panel, and the configurations
required by DSI.

Use these to write to the DISPC registers. These direct register writes would be
later replaced by a function which applies the configuration using the shadow
register programming model.

The function dsi_configure_dispc_clocks() is now called in
dsi_display_init_dispc(), this lets all the lcd manager related configurations
happen in the same place. The DISPC_DIVISORo register was written in
dsi_configure_dispc_clock(), now it just fills up the dispc_clock_info parameter
in mgr_config. The clock_info is written later in dsi_display_init_dispc().
