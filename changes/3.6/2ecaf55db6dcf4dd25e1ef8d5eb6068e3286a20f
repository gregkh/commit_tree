eCryptfs: Make all miscdev functions use daemon ptr in file private_data

Now that a pointer to a valid struct ecryptfs_daemon is stored in the
private_data of an opened /dev/ecryptfs file, the remaining miscdev
functions can utilize the pointer rather than looking up the
ecryptfs_daemon at the beginning of each operation.

The security model of /dev/ecryptfs is simplified a little bit with this
patch. Upon opening /dev/ecryptfs, a per-user ecryptfs_daemon is
registered. Another daemon cannot be registered for that user until the
last file reference is released. During the lifetime of the
ecryptfs_daemon, access checks are not performed on the /dev/ecryptfs
operations because it is assumed that the application securely handles
the opened file descriptor and does not unintentionally leak it to
processes that are not trusted.
