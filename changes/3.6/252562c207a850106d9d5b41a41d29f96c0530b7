ixgbe: Reduce Rx header size to what is actually used

The recent changes to netdev_alloc_skb actually make it so that the size of
the buffer now actually has a more direct input on the truesize.  So in
order to make best use of the piece of a page we are allocated I am
reducing the IXGBE_RX_HDR_SIZE to 256 so that our truesize will be reduced
by 256 bytes as well.

This should result in performance improvements since the number of uses per
page should increase from 4 to 6 in the case of a 4K page.  In addition we
should see socket performance improvements due to the truesize dropping
to less than 1K for buffers less than 256 bytes.
