netfilter: add glue code to integrate nfnetlink_queue and ctnetlink

This patch allows you to include the conntrack information together
with the packet that is sent to user-space via NFQUEUE.

Previously, there was no integration between ctnetlink and
nfnetlink_queue. If you wanted to access conntrack information
from your libnetfilter_queue program, you required to query
ctnetlink from user-space to obtain it. Thus, delaying the packet
processing even more.

Including the conntrack information is optional, you can set it
via NFQA_CFG_F_CONNTRACK flag with the new NFQA_CFG_FLAGS attribute.
