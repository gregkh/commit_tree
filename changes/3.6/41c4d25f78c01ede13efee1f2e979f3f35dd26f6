mm: Update file times from fault path only if .page_mkwrite is not set

Filesystems wanting to properly support freezing need to have control
when file_update_time() is called. After pushing file_update_time()
to all relevant .page_mkwrite implementations we can just stop calling
file_update_time() when filesystem implements .page_mkwrite.
