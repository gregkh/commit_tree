m68knommu: Add support for the Coldfire m5441x.

Add support for the Coldfire 5441x (54410/54415/54416/54417/54418).  Currently
we only support noMMU mode.  It requires the PIT patch posted previously as it
uses the PIT instead of the dma timer as a clock source so we can get all that
GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS goodness.  It also adds some simple clk definitions and
very simple minded power management.  The gpio code is tweeked and some
additional devices are added to devices.c.  The Makefile uses -mv4e as
apparently, the only difference a v4m (m5441x) and a v4e is the later has a
FPU, which I don't think should matter to us in the kernel.
