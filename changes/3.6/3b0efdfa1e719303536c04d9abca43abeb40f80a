mm, sl[aou]b: Extract common fields from struct kmem_cache

Define a struct that describes common fields used in all slab allocators.
A slab allocator either uses the common definition (like SLOB) or is
required to provide members of kmem_cache with the definition given.

After that it will be possible to share code that
only operates on those fields of kmem_cache.

The patch basically takes the slob definition of kmem cache and
uses the field namees for the other allocators.

It also standardizes the names used for basic object lengths in
allocators:

object_size	Struct size specified at kmem_cache_create. Basically
		the payload expected to be used by the subsystem.

size		The size of memory allocator for each object. This size
		is larger than object_size and includes padding, alignment
		and extra metadata for each object (f.e. for debugging
		and rcu).
