xen/mm: do direct hypercall in xen_set_pte() if batching is unavailable

In xen_set_pte() if batching is unavailable (because the caller is in
an interrupt context such as handling a page fault) it would fall back
to using native_set_pte() and trapping and emulating the PTE write.

On 32-bit guests this requires two traps for each PTE write (one for
each dword of the PTE).  Instead, do one mmu_update hypercall
directly.

During construction of the initial page tables, continue to use
native_set_pte() because most of the PTEs being set are in writable
and unpinned pages (see phys_pmd_init() in arch/x86/mm/init_64.c) and
using a hypercall for this is very expensive.

This significantly improves page fault performance in 32-bit PV
guests.
