uprobes: Uprobe_mmap/munmap needs list_for_each_entry_safe()

The bug was introduced by me in 449d0d7c ("uprobes: Simplify the
usage of uprobe->pending_list").

Yes, we do not care about uprobe->pending_list after return and
nobody can remove the current list entry, but put_uprobe(uprobe)
can actually free it and thus we need list_for_each_safe().
