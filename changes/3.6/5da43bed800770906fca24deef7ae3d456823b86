tracing: Add comments for the other bits of ftrace_event_call.flags

	TRACE_EVENT_FL_ENABLED_BIT,
	TRACE_EVENT_FL_FILTERED_BIT,
	TRACE_EVENT_FL_RECORDED_CMD_BIT,

Have comments about what they are, but:

	TRACE_EVENT_FL_CAP_ANY_BIT,
	TRACE_EVENT_FL_NO_SET_FILTER_BIT,
	TRACE_EVENT_FL_IGNORE_ENABLE_BIT,

do not, making them second class citizens. To prevent another
class warfare, these bits have protested for their right to be
commented. And By Golly! I'll give them what they want!
