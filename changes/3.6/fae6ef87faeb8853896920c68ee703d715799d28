net: tcp: move sk_rx_dst_set call after tcp_create_openreq_child()

This commit removes the sk_rx_dst_set calls from
tcp_create_openreq_child(), because at that point the icsk_af_ops
field of ipv6_mapped TCP sockets has not been set to its proper final
value.

Instead, to make sure we get the right sk_rx_dst_set variant
appropriate for the address family of the new connection, we have
tcp_v{4,6}_syn_recv_sock() directly call the appropriate function
shortly after the call to tcp_create_openreq_child() returns.

This also moves inet6_sk_rx_dst_set() to avoid a forward declaration
with the new approach.
