NFS: Convert v4 into a module

This patch exports symbols needed by the v4 module.  In addition, I also
switch over to using IS_ENABLED() to check if CONFIG_NFS_V4 or
CONFIG_NFS_V4_MODULE are set.

The module (nfs4.ko) will be created in the same directory as nfs.ko and
will be automatically loaded the first time you try to mount over NFS v4.
