Btrfs: barrier before waitqueue_active

We need a barrir before calling waitqueue_active otherwise we will miss
wakeups.  So in places that do atomic_dec(); then atomic_read() use
atomic_dec_return() which imply a memory barrier (see memory-barriers.txt)
and then add an explicit memory barrier everywhere else that need them.
Thanks,
