ARM: OMAP4: CPUidle: Use coupled cpuidle states to implement SMP cpuidle.

OMAP4 CPUDILE driver is converted mainly based on notes from the
coupled cpuidle patch series.

The changes include :
- Register both CPUs and C-states to cpuidle driver.
- Set struct cpuidle_device.coupled_cpus
- Set struct cpuidle_device.safe_state to non coupled state.
- Set CPUIDLE_FLAG_COUPLED in struct cpuidle_state.flags for each
  state that affects multiple cpus.
- Separate ->enter hooks for coupled & simple idle.
- CPU0 wait loop for CPU1 power transition.
- CPU1 wakeup mechanism for the idle exit.
- Enabling ARCH_NEEDS_CPU_IDLE_COUPLED for OMAP4.

Thanks to Kevin Hilman and Colin Cross on the suggestions/fixes
on the intermediate version of this patch.
