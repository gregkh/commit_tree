common: dma-mapping: add support for generic dma_mmap_* calls

Commit 9adc5374 ('common: dma-mapping: introduce mmap method') added a
generic method for implementing mmap user call to dma_map_ops structure.

This patch converts ARM and PowerPC architectures (the only providers of
dma_mmap_coherent/dma_mmap_writecombine calls) to use this generic
dma_map_ops based call and adds a generic cross architecture
definition for dma_mmap_attrs, dma_mmap_coherent, dma_mmap_writecombine
functions.

The generic mmap virt_to_page-based fallback implementation is provided for
architectures which don't provide their own implementation for mmap method.
