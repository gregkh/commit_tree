powerpc: Give hypervisor decrementer interrupts their own handler

At the moment the handler for hypervisor decrementer interrupts is
the same as for decrementer interrupts, i.e. timer_interrupt().
This is bogus; if we ever do get a hypervisor decrementer interrupt
it won't have anything to do with the next timer event.  In fact
the only time we get hypervisor decrementer interrupts is when one
is left pending on exit from a KVM guest.

When we get a hypervisor decrementer interrupt we don't need to do
anything special to clear it, since they are edge-triggered on the
transition of HDEC from 0 to -1.  Thus this adds an empty handler
function for them.  We don't need to have them masked when interrupts
are soft-disabled, so we use STD_EXCEPTION_HV instead of
MASKABLE_EXCEPTION_HV.
