[SCSI] Avoid dangling pointer in scsi_requeue_command()

When we call scsi_unprep_request() the command associated with the request
gets destroyed and therefore drops its reference on the device.  If this was
the only reference, the device may get released and we end up with a NULL
pointer deref when we call blk_requeue_request.
