rcu: Remove return value from rcu_assign_pointer()

The return value from rcu_assign_pointer() is not used, and using it
would be quite ugly, for example:

	q = rcu_assign_pointer(global_p, p);

To prevent this sort of ugliness from spreading, this commit wraps
rcu_assign_pointer() in a do-while loop.
