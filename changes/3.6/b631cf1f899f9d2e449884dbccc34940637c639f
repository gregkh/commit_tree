scsi: aha152x: Fix sparse warning and make printing pointer address more portable.

This is to change use of "0x%08x" in favour of "%p" as per ../Documentation/printk-formats.txt,
which also takes care about the following warning during compilation time:

  drivers/scsi/aha152x.c: In function ‘get_command’:
  drivers/scsi/aha152x.c:2987: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size
