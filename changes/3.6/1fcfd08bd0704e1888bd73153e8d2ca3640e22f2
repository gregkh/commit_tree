x86: OLPC: move s/r-related EC cmds to EC driver

The new EC driver calls platform-specific suspend and resume hooks; run
XO-1-specific EC commands from there, rather than deep in s/r code.  If we
attempt to run EC commands after the new EC driver has suspended, it is
refused by the ec->suspended checks.
