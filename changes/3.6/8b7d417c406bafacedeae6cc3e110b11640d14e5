staging: comedi: das08: Add attach_pci() hook

Implement the attach_pci() hook.  This is called by
comedi_pci_auto_config() in preference to the old attach() hook and
avoids searching for the probed PCI device.  Factor out some common code
used by both the attach() and attach_pci() hooks into a couple of new
functions, das08_pci_attach_common() and das08_find_pci_board().
