MIPS: BCM63xx: Add stub to register the SPI platform driver

This patch adds the necessary stub to register the SPI platform driver.
Since the registers are shuffled between the 4 BCM63xx CPUs supported by
this SPI driver we also need to generate the internal register layout and
export this layout for the driver to use it properly.
