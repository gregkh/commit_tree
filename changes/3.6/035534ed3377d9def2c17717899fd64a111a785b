canfd: remove redundant CAN FD flag

The first idea of the CAN FD implementation started with a new struct
canfd_frame to be used for both CAN FD frames and legacy CAN frames.
The now mainlined implementation supports both CAN frame types simultaneously
and distinguishes them only by their required sizes: CAN_MTU and CANFD_MTU.

Only the struct canfd_frame contains a flags element which is needed for the
additional CAN FD information. As CAN FD implicitly means that the 'Extened
Data Length' mode is enabled the formerly defined CANFD_EDL bit became
redundant and also confusing as an unset bit would be an error and would
always need to be tested.

This patch removes the obsolete CANFD_EDL bit and clarifies the documentation
for the use of struct canfd_frame and the CAN FD relevant flags.
