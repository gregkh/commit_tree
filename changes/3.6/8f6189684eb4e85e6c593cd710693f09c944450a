sched: Fix migration thread runtime bogosity

Make stop scheduler class do the same accounting as other classes,

Migration threads can be caught in the act while doing exec balancing,
leading to the below due to use of unmaintained ->se.exec_start.  The
load that triggered this particular instance was an apparently out of
control heavily threaded application that does system monitoring in
what equated to an exec bomb, with one of the VERY frequently migrated
tasks being ps.

%CPU   PID USER     CMD
99.3    45 root     [migration/10]
97.7    53 root     [migration/12]
97.0    57 root     [migration/13]
90.1    49 root     [migration/11]
89.6    65 root     [migration/15]
88.7    17 root     [migration/3]
80.4    37 root     [migration/8]
78.1    41 root     [migration/9]
44.2    13 root     [migration/2]
