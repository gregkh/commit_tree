mm: memcg: split swapin charge function into private and public part

When shmem is charged upon swapin, it does not need to check twice whether
the memory controller is enabled.

Also, shmem pages do not have to be checked for everything that regular
anon pages have to be checked for, so let shmem use the internal version
directly and allow future patches to move around checks that are only
required when swapping in anon pages.
