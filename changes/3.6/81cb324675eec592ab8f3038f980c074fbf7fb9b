ALSA: compress_core: fix open flags test in snd_compr_open()

O_RDONLY is zero so the original test (f->f_flags & O_RDONLY) is always
false and it will never do compress capture.  The test for O_WRONLY is
also slightly off.  The original test would consider "->flags =
(O_WRONLY | O_RDWR)" as write only instead of rejecting it as invalid.

I've also removed the pr_err() because that could flood dmesg.
