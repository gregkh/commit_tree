iio: iio_buffer_register: Use correct channel when calculating masklength

The channel set assigned to the iio device is not necessarily the same has the
channel set passed to iio_buffer_register. So to avoid possible complications
always work with the channel set pass to iio_buffer_register and ignore the
channel set assigned to the iio device.
