libceph: don't change socket state on sock event

Currently the socket state change event handler records an error
message on a connection to distinguish a close while connecting from
a close while a connection was already established.

Changing connection information during handling of a socket event is
not very clean, so instead move this assignment inside con_work(),
where it can be done during normal connection-level processing (and
under protection of the connection mutex as well).

Move the handling of a socket closed event up to the top of the
processing loop in con_work(); there's no point in handling backoff
etc. if we have a newly-closed socket to take care of.
