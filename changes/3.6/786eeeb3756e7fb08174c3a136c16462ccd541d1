staging: csr: remove CsrPmemAlloc

It's just a wrapper around kmalloc(, GFP_KERNEL) + a call to panic() if
we are out of memory, which is a very foolish thing to do (the panic
that is.)

So replace it with calls to kmalloc() and ignore the out-of-memory
casese for now, odds are it will not be hit, and if it does, hey, we
will end up panicing just the same as with the old code.
