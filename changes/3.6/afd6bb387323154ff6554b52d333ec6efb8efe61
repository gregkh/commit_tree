Fix OMAP EHCI suspend/resume failure (i693) '354ab856' causes

an oops on boot for all omap3xxx platforms that use usbhs_omap for
EHCI. The actual oops comes from faulty ehci-omap cleanup, but the
failure caused by the change is evidenced here:

[    3.655059] ehci-omap ehci-omap.0: utmi_p1_gfclk failed error:-2
[    3.661376] ehci-omap: probe of ehci-omap.0 failed with error -2

utmi_p1_gfclk is a clock that exists on OMAP4, but not OMAP3. In the
OMAP3 case, it is configured as a dummy clock. However, OMAP4 lists
the dev_id as NULL, but OMAP3 lists it as "usbhs_omap".

Attempting to get that clock from ehci-omap then fails. The solution
is to just change the clock3xxx_data.c for dummy clocks used in the
errata fix to match the dev_id, NULL, used in clock44xx_data.c.

Tested on BB-xM.
