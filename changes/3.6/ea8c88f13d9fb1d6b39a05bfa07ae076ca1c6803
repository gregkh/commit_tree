PCI/PM: Keep parent bridge active when probing device

This patch fixes the following bug:

http://marc.info/?l=linux-pci&m=134329923124234&w=2

The root cause of the bug is as follow.

If a device is not bound with the corresponding driver, the device
runtime PM will be disabled and the device will be put into suspended
state.  So that, the bridge/PCIe port connected to it may be put into
suspended and low power state.  When do probing for the device later,
because the bridge/PCIe port connected to it is in low power state,
the IO access to device may fail.

To solve the issue, the bridge/PCIe port connected to the device is
put into active state before probing.
