xfs: check for stale inode before acquiring iflock on push

An inode in the AIL can be flush locked and marked stale if
a cluster free transaction occurs at the right time. The
inode item is then marked as flushing, which causes xfsaild
to spin and leaves the filesystem stalled. This is
reproduced by running xfstests 273 in a loop for an
extended period of time.

Check for stale inodes before the flush lock. This marks
the inode as pinned, leads to a log flush and allows the
filesystem to proceed.
