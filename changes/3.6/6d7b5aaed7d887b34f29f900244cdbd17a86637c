namei.c: let follow_link() do put_link() on failure

no need for kludgy "set cookie to ERR_PTR(...) because we failed
before we did actual ->follow_link() and want to suppress put_link()",
no pointless check in put_link() itself.

Callers checked if follow_link() has failed anyway; might as well
break out of their loops if that happened, without bothering
to call put_link() first.
