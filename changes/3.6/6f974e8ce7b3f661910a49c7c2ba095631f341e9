target: move write_same to struct spc_ops

Add spc_ops->execute_write_same() caller for ->execute_cmd() setup,
and update IBLOCK backends to use it.

(nab: add export of spc_get_write_same_sectors symbol)
(roland: Carry forward: Fix range calculation in WRITE SAME emulation
         when num blocks == 0)
