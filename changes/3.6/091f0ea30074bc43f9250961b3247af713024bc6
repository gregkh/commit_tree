tg3: Add New 5719 Read DMA workaround

After Power-on-reset, the 5719's TX DMA length registers may contain
uninitialized values and cause TX DMA to stall.  Check for invalid
values and set a register bit to flush the TX channels.  The bit
needs to be turned off after the DMA channels have been flushed.
