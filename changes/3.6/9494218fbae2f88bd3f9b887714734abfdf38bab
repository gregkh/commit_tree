tcp: use inet6_csk_route_req() in tcp_v6_send_synack()

With the recent change (earlier in this patch series) to set
flowi6_oif to treq->iif in inet6_csk_route_req(), the dst lookup in
these two functions is now identical, so tcp_v6_send_synack() can now
just call inet6_csk_route_req(), to reduce code duplication and keep
things closer to the IPv4 side, which is structured this way.
