staging: comedi: amplc_pc263: Use module_comedi_{pci, }_driver()

If PCI boards are supported, use the module_comedi_pci_driver() macro to
register the module as a comedi driver and a PCI driver.  Otherwise,
only ISA boards are supported so use the module_comedi_driver() macro to
register the module as a comedi driver.

Renamed 'driver_amplc_pc263' to 'amplc_pc263_driver' and removed
'driver_' prefix from PCI related functions and variables, purely for
aesthetic reasons.
