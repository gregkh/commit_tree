ARM: vexpress: Config option for early printk console

Versatile Express platform can be used in different configurations,
the console UART used by early printk may be located at different
addresses in the address space.

This patch makes it possible to select the base address of a PL011
UART to be used as a console output in the kernel configuration.
The default behaviour is still the heuristic detecting memory map
on Cortex-A core tiles.

The zImage decompressor will use the same configuration values
or print out nothing if DEBUG_LL is not enabled.
