ARM: 7527/1: uaccess: explicitly check __user pointer when !CPU_USE_DOMAINS

The {get,put}_user macros don't perform range checking on the provided
__user address when !CPU_HAS_DOMAINS.

This patch reworks the out-of-line assembly accessors to check the user
address against a specified limit, returning -EFAULT if is is out of
range.

[will: changed get_user register allocation to match put_user]
[rmk: fixed building on older ARM architectures]
