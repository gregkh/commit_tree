drm/i915: ensure i2c adapter is all set before adding it

i2c_add_adapter() may do i2c transfers on the bus to detect supported
devices. Therefore the adapter needs to be all set before adding it. This
was not the case for the bit-banging fallback, resulting in an oops if the
device detection GMBUS transfers timed out. Fix the issue by calling
i2c_add_adapter() only after intel_gpio_setup().
