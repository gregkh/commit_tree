ARM: 7478/1: errata: extend workaround for erratum #720789

Commit cdf357f1 ("ARM: 6299/1: errata: TLBIASIDIS and TLBIMVAIS
operations can broadcast a faulty ASID") replaced by-ASID TLB flushing
operations with all-ASID variants to workaround A9 erratum #720789.

This patch extends the workaround to include the tlb_range operations,
which were overlooked by the original patch.
