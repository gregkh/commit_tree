i2c-tiny-usb: Add support for the Robofuzz OSIF USB/I2C converter

Robofuzz OSIF is a generic USB/iIC interface that embeds an ATMega8A
AVR-RISC microcontroler.

The device is based upon Till Harbaum's i2c-tiny-usb and although it
enhances the original design with further functionnalities it still
maintain compatibility with it with respect to the USB/I2C interface.
