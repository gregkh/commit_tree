[SCSI] fcoe: Remove redundant 'less than zero' check

strtoul returns an 'unsigned long' so there is no
reason to check if the value is less than zero.

strtoul already checks for the '-' character deep
in its bowels. It will return an error if the user
has provided a negative value and fcoe_str_to_dev_loss
will return that error to its caller.

This patch fixes the following Coverity reported warning:

CID 703581 -  NO_EFFECT Unsigned compared against 0 - This
less-than-zero comparison of an unsigned value is never true. "*val < 0UL".
