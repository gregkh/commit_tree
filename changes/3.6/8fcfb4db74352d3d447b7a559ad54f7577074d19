net/mlx4_core: Add firmware commands to support device managed flow steering

Add support for firmware commands to attach/detach a new device managed
steering mode. Such network steering rules allow the user to provide an
L2/L3/L4 flow specification to the firmware and have the device to steer
traffic that matches that specification to the provided QP.
