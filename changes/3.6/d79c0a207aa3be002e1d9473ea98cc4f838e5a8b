be2net: do not use SCRATCHPAD register

The CUST_SCRATCHPAD_CSR register is used for marking if FW cleanup is
needed. This is used in a crash kernel scenario. Do no use this register as
it is not available for some functions. Instead, always issue an FLR when
a function is probed *except* when VFs are preset (enabled in the previous
PF load).
