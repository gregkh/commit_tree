ARM: 7424/1: update die handler from x86

Robustify ARM's die() handling with improvements from x86:

 - Fix for a deadlock (before panic in the case of panic_on_oops) if we
   oops under a spinlock which is also used from interrupt handler,
   since the old code was unconditionally enabling interrupts.

 - Usage of arch spinlock so lockdep etc doesn't get involved while
   we're trying to dump out oopses.

 - Deadlock prevention in the unlikely event that die() recurses.

The changes all touch the same few lines of code, so they're done
together in one patch.
