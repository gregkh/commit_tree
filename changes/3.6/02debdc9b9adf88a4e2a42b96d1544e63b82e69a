ixgbe: Populate the prio_tc_map in ixgbe_setup_tc

There were cases where the prio_tc_map was not populated when we were
calling open.  This will result in us incorrectly configuring the traffic
classes when DCB is enabled.  In order to correct this I have updated the
code so that we now populate the values prior to allocating the q_vectors
and calling ixgbe_open.
