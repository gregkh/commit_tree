target: Remove se_session.sess_wait_list

Since we set se_session.sess_tearing_down and stop new commands from
being added to se_session.sess_cmd_list before we wait for commands to
finish when freeing a session, there's no need for a separate
sess_wait_list -- if we let new commands be added to sess_cmd_list
after setting sess_tearing_down, that would be a bug that breaks the
logic of waiting in-flight commands.

Also rename target_splice_sess_cmd_list() to
target_sess_cmd_list_set_waiting(), since we are no longer splicing
onto a separate list.
