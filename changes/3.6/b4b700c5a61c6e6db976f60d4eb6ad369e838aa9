staging: zsmalloc: fix uninit'ed variable warning

This patch fixes an uninitialized variable warning in
alloc_zspage().  It also fixes the secondary issue of
prev_page leaving scope on each loop iteration.  The only
reason this ever worked was because prev_page was occupying
the same space on the stack on each iteration.
