usb: chipidea: udc: fix setup of endpoint maxpacket size

This patch changes the setup of the endpoint maxpacket size. All non control
endpoints are initialized with an undefined ((unsigned short)~0) maxpacket
size. The maxpacket size of Endpoint 0 will be kept at CTRL_PAYLOAD_MAX.

Some gadget drivers check for the maxpacket size before they enable the
endpoint, which leads to a wrong state in these drivers.
