net_sched: gred: actually perform idling in WRED mode

gred_dequeue() and gred_drop() do not seem to get called when the
queue is empty, meaning that we never start idling while in WRED
mode. And since qidlestart is not stored by gred_store_wred_set(),
we would never stop idling while in WRED mode if we ever started.
This messes up the average queue size calculation that influences
packet marking/dropping behavior.

Now, we start WRED mode idling as we are removing the last packet
from the queue. Also we now actually stop WRED mode idling when we
are enqueuing a packet.
