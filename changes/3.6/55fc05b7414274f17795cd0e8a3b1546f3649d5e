mmc: sdhci-pci: CaFe has broken card detection

At http://dev.laptop.org/ticket/11980 we have determined that the
Marvell CaFe SDHCI controller reports bad card presence during
resume. It reports that no card is present even when it is.
This is a regression -- resume worked back around 2.6.37.

Around 400ms after resuming, a "card inserted" interrupt is
generated, at which point it starts reporting presence.

Work around this hardware oddity by setting the
SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION flag.
Thanks to Chris Ball for helping with diagnosis.
