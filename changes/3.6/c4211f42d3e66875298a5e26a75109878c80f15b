x86/tlb: add tlb_flushall_shift for specific CPU

Testing show different CPU type(micro architectures and NUMA mode) has
different balance points between the TLB flush all and multiple invlpg.
And there also has cases the tlb flush change has no any help.

This patch give a interface to let x86 vendor developers have a chance
to set different shift for different CPU type.

like some machine in my hands, balance points is 16 entries on
Romely-EP; while it is at 8 entries on Bloomfield NHM-EP; and is 256 on
IVB mobile CPU. but on model 15 core2 Xeon using invlpg has nothing
help.

For untested machine, do a conservative optimization, same as NHM CPU.
