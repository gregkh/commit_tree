dm thin: commit before gathering status

Commit outstanding metadata before returning the status for a dm thin
pool so that the numbers reported are as up-to-date as possible.

The commit is not performed if the device is suspended or if
the DM_NOFLUSH_FLAG is supplied by userspace and passed to the target
through a new 'status_flags' parameter in the target's dm_status_fn.

The userspace dmsetup tool will support the --noflush flag with the
'dmsetup status' and 'dmsetup wait' commands from version 1.02.76
onwards.
