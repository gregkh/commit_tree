tools/power: turbostat: fix large c1% issue

Under some conditions, c1% was displayed as very large number,
much higher than 100%.

c1% is not measured, it is derived as "that, which is left over"
from other counters.  However, the other counters are not collected
atomically, and so it is possible for c1% to be calaculagted as
a small negative number -- displayed as very large positive.

There was a check for mperf vs tsc for this already,
but it needed to also include the other counters
that are used to calculate c1.
