s390/comments: unify copyright messages and remove file names

Remove the file name from the comment at top of many files. In most
cases the file name was wrong anyway, so it's rather pointless.

Also unify the IBM copyright statement. We did have a lot of sightly
different statements and wanted to change them one after another
whenever a file gets touched. However that never happened. Instead
people start to take the old/"wrong" statements to use as a template
for new files.
So unify all of them in one go.
