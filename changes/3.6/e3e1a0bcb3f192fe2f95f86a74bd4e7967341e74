mac80211: reduce IEEE80211_TX_MAX_RATES

IEEE80211_TX_MAX_RATES can be reduced from 5 to 4 as there
is no current hardware supporting a rate chain with 5 multi
rate stages (mrr), so 4 mrr stages are sufficient.

The memory that is freed within the ieee80211_tx_info struct
will be used in the upcoming Transmission Power Control (TPC)
implementation.
