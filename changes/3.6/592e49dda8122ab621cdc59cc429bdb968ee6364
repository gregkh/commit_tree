net/mlx4: Implement promiscuous mode with device managed flow-steering

The device managed flow steering API has three promiscuous modes:

1. Uplink - captures all the packets that arrive to the port.
2. Allmulti - captures all multicast packets arriving to the port.
3. Function port - for future use, this mode is not implemented yet.

Use these modes with the flow_attach and flow_detach firmware commands
according to the promiscuous state of the netdevice.
