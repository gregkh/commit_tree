drbd: do not reset rs_pending_cnt too early

Fix asserts like
  block drbd0: in got_BlockAck:4634: rs_pending_cnt = -35 < 0 !

We reset the resync lru cache and related information (rs_pending_cnt),
once we successfully finished a resync or online verify, or if the
replication connection is lost.

We also need to reset it if a resync or online verify is aborted
because a lower level disk failed.

In that case the replication link is still established,
and we may still have packets queued in the network buffers
which want to touch rs_pending_cnt.

We do not have any synchronization mechanism to know for sure when all
such pending resync related packets have been drained.

To avoid this counter to go negative (and violate the ASSERT that it
will always be >= 0), just do not reset it when we lose a disk.

It is good enough to make sure it is re-initialized before the next
resync can start: reset it when we re-attach a disk.
