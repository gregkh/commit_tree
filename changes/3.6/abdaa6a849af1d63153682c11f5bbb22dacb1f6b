libceph: don't use bio_iter as a flag

Recently a bug was fixed in which the bio_iter field in a ceph
message was not being properly re-initialized when a message got
re-transmitted:
    commit 43643528cce60ca184fe8197efa8e8da7c89a037
    Author: Yan, Zheng <zheng.z.yan@intel.com>
    rbd: Clear ceph_msg->bio_iter for retransmitted message

We are now only initializing the bio_iter field when we are about to
start to write message data (in prepare_write_message_data()),
rather than every time we are attempting to write any portion of the
message data (in write_partial_msg_pages()).  This means we no
longer need to use the msg->bio_iter field as a flag.

So just don't do that any more.  Trust prepare_write_message_data()
to ensure msg->bio_iter is properly initialized, every time we are
about to begin writing (or re-writing) a message's bio data.
