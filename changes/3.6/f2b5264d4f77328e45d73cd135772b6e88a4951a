HID: usbhid: replace HID_REPORTED_IDLE with HID_SUSPENDED

This patch (as1595) improves the usbhid driver by using the
HID_SUSPENDED bitflag to indicate that the device is suspended rather
than using HID_REPORTED_IDLE, which the patch removes.

Since HID_SUSPENDED was not being used for anything, and since the
name "HID_REPORTED_IDLE" doesn't convey much meaning, the end result
is easier to read and understand.
