xen/m2p: do not reuse kmap_op->dev_bus_addr

If the caller passes a valid kmap_op to m2p_add_override, we use
kmap_op->dev_bus_addr to store the original mfn, but dev_bus_addr is
part of the interface with Xen and if we are batching the hypercalls it
might not have been written by the hypervisor yet. That means that later
on Xen will write to it and we'll think that the original mfn is
actually what Xen has written to it.

Rather than "stealing" struct members from kmap_op, keep using
page->index to store the original mfn and add another parameter to
m2p_remove_override to get the corresponding kmap_op instead.
It is now responsibility of the caller to keep track of which kmap_op
corresponds to a particular page in the m2p_override (gntdev, the only
user of this interface that passes a valid kmap_op, is already doing that).
