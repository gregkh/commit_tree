staging: comedi: amplc_pci224: Change return type of pci224_find_pci()

pci224_find_pci() finds a supported PCI device, returning 0 on success
or -EIO on failure and returning the pointer to the PCI device via a
struct pci_dev ** parameter.  Change it to return the struct pci_dev *
on success or NULL on failure.
