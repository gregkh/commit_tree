i2c: i2c-ocores: support for 16bit and 32bit IO

Some architectures supports only 16-bit or 32-bit read/write access to
their IO space. Add a 'reg-io-width' platform and OF parameter which
specifies the IO width to support these platforms.

reg-io-width can be specified as 1, 2 or 4, and has a default value
of 1 if it is unspecified.
