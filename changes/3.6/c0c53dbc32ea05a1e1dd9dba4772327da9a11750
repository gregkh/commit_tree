USB: EHCI: add new root-hub state: STOPPING

This patch (as1571) adds a new state for ehci-hcd's root hubs:
EHCI_RH_STOPPING.  This value is used at times when the root hub is
being stopped and we don't know whether or not the hardware has
finished all its DMA yet.

Although the purpose may not be apparent, this distinction will come
in useful later on.  Future patches will avoid actions that depend on
the root hub being operational (like turning on the async or periodic
schedules) when they see the state is EHCI_RH_STOPPING.
