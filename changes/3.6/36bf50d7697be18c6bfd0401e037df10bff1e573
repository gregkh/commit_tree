x86, microcode, AMD: Fix broken ucode patch size check

This issue was recently observed on an AMD C-50 CPU where a patch of
maximum size was applied.

Commit be62adb49294 ("x86, microcode, AMD: Simplify ucode verification")
added current_size in get_matching_microcode(). This is calculated as
size of the ucode patch + 8 (ie. size of the header). Later this is
compared against the maximum possible ucode patch size for a CPU family.
And of course this fails if the patch has already maximum size.
