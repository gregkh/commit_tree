vmscan: remove obsolete shrink_control comment

09f363c7 ("vmscan: fix shrinker callback bug in fs/super.c") fixed a
shrinker callback which was returning -1 when nr_to_scan is zero, which
caused excessive slab scanning.  But 635697c6 ("vmscan: fix initial
shrinker size handling") fixed the problem, again so we can freely return
-1 although nr_to_scan is zero.  So let's revert 09f363c7 because the
comment added in 09f363c7 made an unnecessary rule.
