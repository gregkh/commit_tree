ALSA: hda - Workaround for silent output on VAIO Z with ALC889

On recent kernels, Realtek codec parser tries to optimize the routing
aggressively and take the headphone output as primary at first.  This
caused a regression on VAIO Z with ALC889, the silent output from the
speaker.

The problem seems that the speaker pin must be connected to the first
DAC (0x02) on this machine by some reason although the codec itself
advertises the flexible routing with any DACs.

This patch adds a fix-up for choosing the speaker pin as the primary
so that the right DAC is assigned on this device.
