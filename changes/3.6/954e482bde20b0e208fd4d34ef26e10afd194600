x86/copy_user_generic: Optimize copy_user_generic with CPU erms feature

According to Intel 64 and IA-32 SDM and Optimization Reference Manual, beginning
with Ivybridge, REG string operation using MOVSB and STOSB can provide both
flexible and high-performance REG string operations in cases like memory copy.
Enhancement availability is indicated by CPUID.7.0.EBX[9] (Enhanced REP MOVSB/
STOSB).

If CPU erms feature is detected, patch copy_user_generic with enhanced fast
string version of copy_user_generic.

A few new macros are defined to reduce duplicate code in ALTERNATIVE and
ALTERNATIVE_2.
