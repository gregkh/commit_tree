hfs: remove extra mdb write on unmount

HFS calls 'hfs_write_super()' from 'hfs_put_super()' in order to write the MDB
to the media. However, it is not needed because VFS calls '->sync_fs()' before
calling '->put_super()' - so by the time we are in 'hfs_write_super()', the MDB
is already synchronized.
