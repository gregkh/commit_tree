avr32/mm/fault.c: port OOM changes to do_page_fault

Commits d065bd810b6d ("mm: retry page fault when blocking on disk
transfer") and 37b23e0525d3 ("x86,mm: make pagefault killable")
introduced changes into the x86 pagefault handler for making the page
fault handler retryable as well as killable.

These changes reduce the mmap_sem hold time, which is crucial during OOM
killer invocation.

Port these changes to AVR32.
