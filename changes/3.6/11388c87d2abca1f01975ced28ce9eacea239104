PM / Sleep: Require CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND to use wake_lock/wake_unlock

Require processes wanting to use the wake_lock/wake_unlock sysfs
files to have the CAP_BLOCK_SUSPEND capability, which also is
required for the eventpoll EPOLLWAKEUP flag to be effective, so that
all interfaces related to blocking autosleep depend on the same
capability.
