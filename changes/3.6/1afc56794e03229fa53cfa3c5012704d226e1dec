netfilter: nf_ct_helper: implement variable length helper private data

This patch uses the new variable length conntrack extensions.

Instead of using union nf_conntrack_help that contain all the
helper private data information, we allocate variable length
area to store the private helper data.

This patch includes the modification of all existing helpers.
It also includes a couple of include header to avoid compilation
warnings.
