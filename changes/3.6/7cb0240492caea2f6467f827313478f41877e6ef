netvm: allow the use of __GFP_MEMALLOC by specific sockets

Allow specific sockets to be tagged SOCK_MEMALLOC and use __GFP_MEMALLOC
for their allocations.  These sockets will be able to go below watermarks
and allocate from the emergency reserve.  Such sockets are to be used to
service the VM (iow.  to swap over).  They must be handled kernel side,
exposing such a socket to user-space is a bug.

There is a risk that the reserves be depleted so for now, the
administrator is responsible for increasing min_free_kbytes as necessary
to prevent deadlock for their workloads.
