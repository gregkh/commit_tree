uprobes: Don't use loff_t for the valid virtual address

loff_t looks confusing when it is used for the virtual address.
Change map_info and install_breakpoint/remove_breakpoint paths
to use "unsigned long".

The patch doesn't change vma_address(), it can't return "long"
because it is used to verify the mapping. But probably this
needs some cleanups too.
