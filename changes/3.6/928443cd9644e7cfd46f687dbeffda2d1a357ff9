libceph: start separating connection flags from state

A ceph_connection holds a mixture of connection state (as in "state
machine" state) and connection flags in a single "state" field.  To
make the distinction more clear, define a new "flags" field and use
it rather than the "state" field to hold Boolean flag values.
