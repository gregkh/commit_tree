leds: fix led_brightness_set when soft-blinking

Move led_stop_software_blink() code into led_brightness_set() to ensure
software blink timer is stopped and cleared when changing trigger.

Also use led_set_brightness() instead of calling
led_cdev->brightness_set() directly to keep led_cdev->brightness
consistent with current LED status.

This ensure proper cleaning when changing triggers, as without this fix
a LED may be turned off while leaving it's led_cdev->brightness = 1,
leading to an erratic software-blink behaviour.

The problem was easy to reproduce by changing the trigger from "timer"
to "oneshot".
