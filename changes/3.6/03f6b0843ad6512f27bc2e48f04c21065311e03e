cfg80211: add channel flag to prohibit OFDM operation

Currently the only way for wireless drivers to tell whether or not OFDM
is allowed on the current channel is to check the regulatory
information. However, this requires hodling cfg80211_mutex, which is not
visible to the drivers.

Other regulatory restrictions are provided as flags in the channel
definition, so let's do similarly with OFDM. This patch adds a new flag,
IEEE80211_CHAN_NO_OFDM, to tell drivers that OFDM on a channel is not
allowed. This flag is set on any channels for which regulatory indicates
that OFDM is prohibited.
