ARM: OMAP2+: PRM/CM: Move the stubbed prm and cm functions to prcm.c file and make them __weak

Some prm and cm registers read/write and status functions
are built only for some custom OMAP2+ builds and are stubbed
in header files for other builds under ifdef statements.
But this results in adding new CONFIG_ARCH_OMAPXXX
checks when SOCs are added in the future. So move them
to a common place for OMAP2+ and make them 'weak' implementations.

This way no new ifdefs would be required in the future and also
cleans up the existing code.
