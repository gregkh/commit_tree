MIPS: Netlogic: Update comments in smpboot.S

No change in logic, comments update and whitespace cleanup.

* A few comments in the file were in assembler style and the rest
  int C style, convert all of them to C style.
* Mark workarounds for Ax silicon with a macro XLP_AX_WORKAROUND
* Whitespace fixes - use tabs consistently
* rename __config_lsu macro to xlp_config_lsu
