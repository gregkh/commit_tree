ARM: OMAP3: PM: correct enable/disable of daisy io chain

Currently the enabling and disabling of IO Daisy chain is not
according to the TRM. The below steps are followed to enable/
disable the IO chain, based loosely on the "Sec 3.5.7.2.2
I/O Wake-Up Mechanism" section in OMAP3630 Public TRM[1].

Steps to enable IO chain:
[a] Set PM_WKEN_WKUP.EN_IO bit
[b] Set the PM_WKEN_WKUP.EN_IO_CHAIN bit
[c] Poll for PM_WKST_WKUP.ST_IO_CHAIN.
[d] When ST_IO_CHAIN bit set to 1, clear PM_WKEN_WKUP.EN_IO_CHAIN
[e] Clear ST_IO_CHAIN bit.

Steps to disable IO chain:
[a] Clear PM_WKEN_WKUP.EN_IO_CHAIN bit
[b] Clear PM_WKEN_WKUP.EN_IO bit
[c] Clear PM_WKST_WKUP.ST_IO bit by writing 1 to it.

Step [e] & [c] in each case can be skipped, as these are handled
by the PRCM interrupt handler later.
