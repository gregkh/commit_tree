perf/x86: Export Sandy Bridge uncore clockticks event in sysfs

This patch exports the clockticks event and its encoding to user level.
The clockticks event was exported for Nehalem/Westmere but not for Sandy
Bridge (client). Given that it uses a special encoding, it needs to be
exported to user tools, so users can do:

  # perf stat -a -C 0 -e uncore_cbox_0/clockticks/ sleep 1
