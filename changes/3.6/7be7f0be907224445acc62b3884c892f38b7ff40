rcu: Move rcu_barrier_mutex to rcu_state structure

In order to allow each RCU flavor to concurrently execute its
rcu_barrier() function, it is necessary to move the relevant
state to the rcu_state structure.  This commit therefore moves the
rcu_barrier_mutex global variable to a new ->barrier_mutex field
in the rcu_state structure.
