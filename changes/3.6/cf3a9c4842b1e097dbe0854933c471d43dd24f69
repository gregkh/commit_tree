rcu: Increase rcu_barrier() concurrency

The traditional rcu_barrier() implementation has serialized all requests,
regardless of RCU flavor, and also does not coalesce concurrent requests.
In the past, this has been good and sufficient.

However, systems are getting larger and use of rcu_barrier() has been
increasing.  This commit therefore introduces a counter-based scheme
that allows _rcu_barrier() calls for the same flavor of RCU to take
advantage of each others' work.
