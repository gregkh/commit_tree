nfs: disable data cache revalidation for swapfiles

The VM does not like PG_private set on PG_swapcache pages.  As suggested
by Trond in http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/8/25/348, this patch disables NFS
data cache revalidation on swap files.  as it does not make sense to have
other clients change the file while it is being used as swap.  This avoids
setting PG_private on swap pages, since there ought to be no further races
with invalidate_inode_pages2() to deal with.

Since we cannot set PG_private we cannot use page->private which is
already used by PG_swapcache pages to store the nfs_page.  Thus augment
the new nfs_page_find_request logic.
