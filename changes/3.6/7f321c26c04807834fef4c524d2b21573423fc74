PM / Runtime: Fix rpm_resume() return value for power.no_callbacks set

For devices whose power.no_callbacks flag is set, rpm_resume()
should return 1 if the device's parent is already active, so that
the callers of pm_runtime_get() don't think that they have to wait
for the device to resume (asynchronously) in that case (the core
won't queue up an asynchronous resume in that case, so there's
nothing to wait for anyway).

Modify the code accordingly (and make sure that an idle notification
will be queued up on success, even if 1 is to be returned).
