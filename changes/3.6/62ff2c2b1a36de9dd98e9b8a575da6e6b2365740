I2C: OMAP: Prevent the register access after pm_runtime_put in probe

Currently in probe
pm_runtime_put(dev->dev);

...
        /* i2c device drivers may be active on return from add_adapter() */
        adap->nr = pdev->id;
        r = i2c_add_numbered_adapter(adap);
        if (r) {
                dev_err(dev->dev, "failure adding adapter\n");
                goto err_free_irq;
        }
...

return 0;

err_free_irq:
        free_irq(dev->irq, dev);
err_unuse_clocks:
        omap_i2c_write_reg(dev, OMAP_I2C_CON_REG, 0);
        pm_runtime_put(dev->dev);

This may access the i2c registers without the clocks in the error cases.
Fix the same by moving the pm_runtime_put after the error check.
