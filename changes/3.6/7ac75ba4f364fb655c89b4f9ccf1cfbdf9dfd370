staging: comedi: amplc_pc263: Change return type of pc263_find_pci()

pc263_find_pci() finds a supported PCI device, returning 0 on success
or -EIO on failure and returning the pointer to the PCI device via a
struct pci_dev ** parameter.  Change it to return the struct pci_dev *
on success or NULL on failure.
