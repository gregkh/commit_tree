driver core: fix shutdown races with probe/remove(v3)

Firstly, .shutdown callback may touch a uninitialized hardware
if dev->driver is set and .probe is not completed.

Secondly, device_shutdown() may dereference a null pointer to cause
oops when dev->driver is cleared after it has been checked in
device_shutdown().

So just hold device lock and its parent lock(if it has) to
fix the races.
