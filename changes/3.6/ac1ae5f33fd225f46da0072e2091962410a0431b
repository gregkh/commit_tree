be2net: dont pull too much data in skb linear part

skb_fill_rx_data() pulls 64 byte of data in skb->data

Its too much for TCP (with no options) on IPv4, as total size of headers
is 14 + 40 = 54

This means tcp stack and splice() are suboptimal, since tcp payload
is in part in tcp->data, and in part in skb frag.
