[SCSI] libsas: enforce eh strategy handlers only in eh context

The strategy handlers may be called in places that are problematic for
libsas (i.e. sata resets outside of domain revalidation filtering /
libata link recovery), or problematic for userspace (non-blocking ioctl
to sleeping reset functions).  However, these routines are also called
for eh escalations and recovery of scsi_eh_prep_cmnd(), so permit them
as long as we are running in the host's error handler, otherwise arrange
for them to be triggered in eh_context.
