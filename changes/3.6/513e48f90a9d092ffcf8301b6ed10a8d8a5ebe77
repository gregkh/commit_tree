staging: comedi: ni_labpc: unlock spinlock on command error

When starting the acquisition the labpc_ai_cmd function was
exiting without unlocking the spinlock. This results in a
sparse warning:

warning: context imbalance in 'labpc_ai_cmd' - different lock contexts for basic block

Add the missing spin_unlock_irqrestore calls.
