dmaengine: PL08x: get rid of write only pool_ctr and free_txd locking

The free function says the pl08x lock should be taken before calling
it.  However, the DMA pool allocation/freeing is already properly
locked.  The only thing that would need this is pool_ctr, which
happens to be a write-only variable.

Let's get rid of this, and eliminate any need for additional locking
here.
