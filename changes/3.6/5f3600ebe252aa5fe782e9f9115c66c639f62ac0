ixgbevf: Use igb style interrupt masks instead of ixgbe style

The interrupt registers accessed in ixgbevf are more similar to the igb
style registers than they are to the ixgbe style registers.  As such we
would be better off setting up the code for the EICS, EIMS, EICS, EIAM, and
EIAC like we do in igb instead of ixgbe.
