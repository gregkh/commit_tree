s390/mm: fix fault handling for page table walk case

Make sure the kernel does not incorrectly create a SIGBUS signal during
user space accesses:

For user space accesses in the switched addressing mode case the kernel
may walk page tables and access user address space via the kernel
mapping. If a page table entry is invalid the function __handle_fault()
gets called in order to emulate a page fault and trigger all the usual
actions like paging in a missing page etc. by calling handle_mm_fault().

If handle_mm_fault() returns with an error fixup handling is necessary.
For the switched addressing mode case all errors need to be mapped to
-EFAULT, so that the calling uaccess function can return -EFAULT to
user space.

Unfortunately the __handle_fault() incorrectly calls do_sigbus() if
VM_FAULT_SIGBUS is set. This however should only happen if a page fault
was triggered by a user space instruction. For kernel mode uaccesses
the correct action is to only return -EFAULT.
So user space may incorrectly see SIGBUS signals because of this bug.

For current machines this would only be possible for the switched
addressing mode case in conjunction with futex operations.
