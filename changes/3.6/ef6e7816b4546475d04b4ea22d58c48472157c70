edac_mc: fix messy kfree calls in the error path

coccinelle warns about:

   421         if (mci->csrows) {

   430                  }
   431                  kfree(mci->csrows);
   432          }

and that code block seem to mess things up in several ways (double free, memory
leak, out-of-bound reads etc.):

L422: The iterator "chn" and bound "tot_channels" are totally wrong. Should be
      "row" and "tot_csrows" respectively. Which means either memory leak, or
      out-of-bound reads (which if does not trigger an immediate page fault
      error, will further lead to kfree() on random addresses).

L425: The inner loop is reusing the same iterator "chn" as the outer loop,
      which could lead to premature end of the outer loop, and hence memory leak.

L429: The array index 'i' in mci->csrows[i] is a temporary value used in
      previous loops, and won't change at all in the current loop. Which
      means either out-of-bound read and possibly kfree(random number), or the
      same mci->csrows[i] get freed once and again, and possibly double free
      for the kfree(csr) in L427.

L426/L427: a kfree(csr->channels) is needed in between to avoid leaking the memory.

The buggy code was introduced by commit de3910eb ("edac: change the mem
allocation scheme to make Documentation/kobject.txt happy") in the 3.6-rc1
merge window. Fix it by freeing up resources in this order:

  free csrows[i]->channels[j]
  free csrows[i]->channels
  free csrows[i]
  free csrows
