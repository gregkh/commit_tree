mm/buddy: cleanup on should_fail_alloc_page

Currently, function should_fail() has "bool" for its return value, so it's
reasonable to change the return value of function should_fail_alloc_page()
into "bool" as well.

The patch does cleanup on function should_fail_alloc_page() to have "bool"
for its return value.
