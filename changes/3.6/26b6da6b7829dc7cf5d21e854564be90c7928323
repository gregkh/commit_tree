iwlegacy: print how long queue was actually stuck

Every now and then, after resuming from suspend, the iwlegacy driver
prints
    iwl4965 0000:03:00.0: Queue 2 stuck for 2000 ms.
    iwl4965 0000:03:00.0: On demand firmware reload

I have no idea what causes these errors. But the code currently uses
wd_timeout in the first error. wd_timeout will generally be set at
IL_DEF_WD_TIMEOUT (ie, 2000). Perhaps printing for how long the queue
was actually stuck can clarify the cause of these errors.
