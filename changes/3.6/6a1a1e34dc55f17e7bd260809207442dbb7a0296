SUNRPC: Add rpcauth_list_flavors()

The gss_mech_list_pseudoflavors() function provides a list of
currently registered GSS pseudoflavors.  This list does not include
any non-GSS flavors that have been registered with the RPC client.
nfs4_find_root_sec() currently adds these extra flavors by hand.

Instead, nfs4_find_root_sec() should be looking at the set of flavors
that have been explicitly registered via rpcauth_register().  And,
other areas of code will soon need the same kind of list that
contains all flavors the kernel currently knows about (see below).

Rather than cloning the open-coded logic in nfs4_find_root_sec() to
those new places, introduce a generic RPC function that generates a
full list of registered auth flavors and pseudoflavors.

A new rpc_authops method is added that lists a flavor's
pseudoflavors, if it has any.  I encountered an interesting module
loader loop when I tried to get the RPC client to invoke
gss_mech_list_pseudoflavors() by name.

This patch is a pre-requisite for server trunking discovery, and a
pre-requisite for fixing up the in-kernel mount client to do better
automatic security flavor selection.
