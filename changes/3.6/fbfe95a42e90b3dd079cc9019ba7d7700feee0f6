inet: Create and use rt{,6}_get_peer_create().

There's a lot of places that open-code rt{,6}_get_peer() only because
they want to set 'create' to one.  So add an rt{,6}_get_peer_create()
for their sake.

There were also a few spots open-coding plain rt{,6}_get_peer() and
those are transformed here as well.
