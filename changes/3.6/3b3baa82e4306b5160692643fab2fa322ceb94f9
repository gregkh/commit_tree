HID: uhid: forward raw output reports to user-space

Some drivers that use non-standard HID features require raw output reports
sent to the device. We now forward these requests directly to user-space
so the transport-level driver can correctly send it to the device or
handle it correspondingly.

There is no way to signal back whether the transmission was successful,
moreover, there might be lots of messages coming out from the driver
flushing the output-queue. However, there is currently no driver that
causes this so we are safe. If some drivers need to transmit lots of data
this way, we need a method to synchronize this and can implement another
UHID_OUTPUT_SYNC event.
