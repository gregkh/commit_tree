USB: FHCI: Reusing QUICC Engine USB Controller registers from immap_qe.h

The struct fhci_regs (in drivers/usb/host/fhci.h) is basically a redefinition
of the struct qe_usb_ctlr (in arch/powerpc/include/asm/immap_qe.h).

The qe_usb_ctlr struct is preferrable once it uses accurately the registers'
names found in the Freescale's QUICC Engine Block Reference Manuals (QEIWRM.pdf
Rev.4.4 Chapter 19 for MPC836xE series and MPC8323ERM.pdf Rev.2 Chapter 36 for
MPC832xE series), making easier to map the FHCI device driver to the hardware
manual. Also, as the FHCI driver uses the USB Controller registers, the name
qe_usb_ctlr is a more precise representation of the hardware than fhci_regs.
