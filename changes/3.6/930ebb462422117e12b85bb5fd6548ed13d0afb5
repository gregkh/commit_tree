    drm/i915: wrap up gt powersave enabling functions

I've botched up the handling of ironlake_disable_rc6. Fix this up by
calling it at the right place. Note though that ironlake_disable_rc6
does a bit more than just disabling rc6 - it also tears down all the
allocated context objects.

Hence we need to move intel_teardown_rc6 out and directly call it from
intel_modeset_cleanup.

Also properly mark ironlake_enable_rc6 as static and kill the un-used
declaration in i915_drv.h.

Note: In review a question popped out why disable_rc6 also tears down
the backing object and why we should move that out - it's simply for
consistency with gen6+ rps code, which does it that way.
