ixgbe: Drop probe_vf and merge functionality into ixgbe_enable_sriov

This is meant to fix a bug in which we were not checking for pre-existing
VFs if we were not setting the max_vfs value at driver load.  What happens
now is that we always call ixgbe_enable_sriov and this checks for
pre-existing VFs ore requested VFs prior to deciding on no SR-IOV.
