mfd: Remove unused variable from da9052_device_init

This is to address the following warning during compilation time:

  drivers/mfd/da9052-core.c: In function ‘da9052_device_init’:
  drivers/mfd/da9052-core.c:646: warning: unused variable ‘desc’

This variable is indeed no longer in use (change can be traced back
to commit: 8614419451d88bf99fff7f5e468fe45f8450891e).
