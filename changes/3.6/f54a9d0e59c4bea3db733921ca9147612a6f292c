md/raid1: submit IO from originating thread instead of md thread.

queuing writes to the md thread means that all requests go through the
one processor which may not be able to keep up with very high request
rates.

So use the plugging infrastructure to submit all requests on unplug.
If a 'schedule' is needed, we fall back on the old approach of handing
the requests to the thread for it to handle.
