dm thin: support for non power of 2 pool blocksize

Non power of 2 blocksize support is needed to properly align thinp IO
on storage that has non power of 2 optimal IO sizes (e.g. RAID6 10+2).

Use sector_div to support non power of 2 blocksize for the pool's
data device.  This provides comparable performance to the power of 2
math that was performed until now (as tested on modern x86_64 hardware).

The kernel currently assumes that limits->discard_granularity is a power
of two so the thin target only enables discard support if the block
size is a power of two.

Eliminate pool structure's 'block_shift', 'offset_mask' and
remaining 4 byte holes.
