dmaengine: PL08x: move DMA signal muxing into slave prepare code

Move the DMA request muxing into the slave prepare code and txd
release/completion code.  This means we only hold the DMA request
mux while there are descriptors waiting to be started or are in
progress.

This leaves txd->direction as a write-only variable; remove it.
