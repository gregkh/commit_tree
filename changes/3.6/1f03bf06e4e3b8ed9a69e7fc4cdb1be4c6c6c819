bcma: fix invalid PMU chip control masks

Commit b9562545ef0b ("bcma: complete workaround for BCMA43224 and
BCM4313") introduced the wrong masks for setting the chip control
registers - the "mask" parameter is inverse.

It should be the mask of bits *not* changed, which is admittedly a bit
non-intuitive.

The incorrect mask not only causes the driver to not work correctly on
the chips affected (eg the BCM43224 on the Macbook Air 4,2) but the
state persists over a soft reset, causing the next boot to not
necessarily see the device correctly.
