Revert "x86/early_printk: Replace obsolete simple_strtoul() usage with kstrtoint()"

This reverts commit fbd24153c48b8425b09c161a020483cd77da870e.

This commit is subtly buggy: kstrto*int() can return an error but
it's not checked in every path. simple_strtoul() on the other hand
could not fail, so this patch subtly intruduces new failure modes.
