Btrfs: do not abort transaction in prealloc case

During disk balance, we prealloc new file extent for file data relocation,
but we may fail in 'no available space' case, and it leads to flipping btrfs
into readonly.

It is not necessary to bail out and abort transaction since we do have several
ways to rescue ourselves from ENOSPC case.
