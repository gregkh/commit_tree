ARM: mm: fix MMU mapping of CMA regions

Fix dma_contiguous_remap() so that it continues through all the
regions, even after encountering one that is outside lowmem.
Without this change, if you have two CMA regions, the first outside
lowmem and the seocnd inside lowmem, only the second one will get
set up in the MMU. Data written to that region then doesn't get
automatically flushed from the cache into memory.
