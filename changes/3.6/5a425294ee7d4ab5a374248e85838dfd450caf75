perf/x86: Fix Intel shared extra MSR allocation

Zheng Yan reported that event group validation can wreck event state
when Intel extra_reg allocation changes event state.

Validation shouldn't change any persistent state. Cloning events in
validate_{event,group}() isn't really pretty either, so add a few
special cases to avoid modifying the event state.

The code is restructured to minimize the special case impact.
