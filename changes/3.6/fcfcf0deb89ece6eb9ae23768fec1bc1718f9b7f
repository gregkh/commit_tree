HID: uhid: implement feature requests

HID standard allows sending a feature request to the device which is
answered by an HID report. uhid implements this by sending a UHID_FEATURE
event to user-space which then must answer with UHID_FEATURE_ANSWER. If it
doesn't do this in a timely manner, the request is discarded silently.

We serialize the feature requests, that is, there is always only a single
active feature-request sent to user-space, other requests have to wait.
HIDP and USB-HID do it the same way.

Because we discard feature-requests silently, we must make sure to match
a response to the corresponding request. We use sequence-IDs for this so
user-space must copy the ID from the request into the answer.
Feature-answers are ignored if they do not contain the same ID as the
currently pending feature request.

Internally, we must make sure that feature-requests are synchronized with
UHID_DESTROY and close() events. We must not dead-lock when closing the
HID device, either, so we have to use separate locks.
