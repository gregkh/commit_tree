ARM: PRIMA2: delete redundant codes to restore LATCHED when timer resumes

The only way to write LATCHED registers to write LATCH_BIT to LATCH register,
that will latch COUNTER into LATCHED.e.g.
writel_relaxed(SIRFSOC_TIMER_LATCH_BIT, sirfsoc_timer_base +
	SIRFSOC_TIMER_LATCH);

Writing values to LATCHED registers directly is useless at all.
