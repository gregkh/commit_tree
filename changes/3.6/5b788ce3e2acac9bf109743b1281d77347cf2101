block: prepare for multiple request_lists

Request allocation is about to be made per-blkg meaning that there'll
be multiple request lists.

* Make queue full state per request_list.  blk_*queue_full() functions
  are renamed to blk_*rl_full() and takes @rl instead of @q.

* Rename blk_init_free_list() to blk_init_rl() and make it take @rl
  instead of @q.  Also add @gfp_mask parameter.

* Add blk_exit_rl() instead of destroying rl directly from
  blk_release_queue().

* Add request_list->q and make request alloc/free functions -
  blk_free_request(), [__]freed_request(), __get_request() - take @rl
  instead of @q.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional difference.
