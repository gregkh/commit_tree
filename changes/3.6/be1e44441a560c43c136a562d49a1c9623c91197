svcrpc: fix BUG() in svc_tcp_clear_pages

Examination of svc_tcp_clear_pages shows that it assumes sk_tcplen is
consistent with sk_pages[] (in particular, sk_pages[n] can't be NULL if
sk_tcplen would lead us to expect n pages of data).

svc_tcp_restore_pages zeroes out sk_pages[] while leaving sk_tcplen.
This is OK, since both functions are serialized by XPT_BUSY.  However,
that means the inconsistency must be repaired before dropping XPT_BUSY.

Therefore we should be ensuring that svc_tcp_save_pages repairs the
problem before exiting svc_tcp_recv_record on error.

Symptoms were a BUG() in svc_tcp_clear_pages.
