[media] lirc_sir: make device registration work

For one, the driver device pointer needs to be filled in, or the lirc core
will refuse to load the driver. And we really need to wire up all the
platform_device bits. This has been tested via the lirc sourceforge tree
and verified to work, been sitting there for months, finally getting
around to sending it. :\
