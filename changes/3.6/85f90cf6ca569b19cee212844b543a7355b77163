x86: OLPC: switch over to using new EC driver on x86

This uses the new EC driver framework in drivers/platform/olpc.  The
XO-1 and XO-1.5-specific code is still in arch/x86, but the generic stuff
(including a new workqueue; no more running EC commands with IRQs disabled!)
can be shared with other architectures.
