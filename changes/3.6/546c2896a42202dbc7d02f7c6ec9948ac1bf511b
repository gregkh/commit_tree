ARM: 7446/1: spinlock: use ticket algorithm for ARMv6+ locking implementation

Ticket spinlocks ensure locking fairness by introducing a FIFO-like
nature to the granting of lock acquisitions and also reducing the
thundering herd effect when spinning on a lock by allowing the cacheline
to remain in a shared state amongst the waiting CPUs. This is especially
important on systems where memory-access times are not necessarily
uniform when accessing the lock structure (for example, on a
multi-cluster platform where the lock is allocated into L1 when a CPU
releases it).

This patch implements the ticket spinlock algorithm for ARM, replacing
the simpler implementation for ARMv6+ processors.
