net: Do delayed neigh confirmation.

When a dst_confirm() happens, mark the confirmation as pending in the
dst.  Then on the next packet out, when we have the neigh in-hand, do
the update.

This removes the dependency in dst_confirm() of dst's having an
attached neigh.

While we're here, remove the explicit 'dst' NULL check, all except 2
or 3 call sites ensure it's not NULL.  So just fix those cases up.
