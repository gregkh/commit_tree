HID: usbhid: fix error paths in suspend

This patch (as1597) fixes some of the error paths in usbhid's suspend
routine.  The driver was not careful to restart everything that might
have been stopped, in cases where a suspend failed.

For example, once the HID_SUSPENDED flag is set, an output report
submission would not restart the corresponding URB queue.  If a
suspend fails, it's therefore necessary to check whether the queues
need to be restarted.
