iio: Add helper functions for enum style channel attributes

We often have the case were we do have a enum style channel attribute. These
attributes have in common that they are a list of string values which usually
map in a 1-to-1 fashion to integer values.

This patch implements some common helper code for implementing enum style
channel attributes using extended channel attributes. The helper functions take
care of converting between the string and integer values, as well providing a
function for "_available" attributes which list all available enum items.
