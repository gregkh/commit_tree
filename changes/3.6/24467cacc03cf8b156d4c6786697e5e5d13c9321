mm: memcg: remove needless !mm fixup to init_mm when charging

It does not matter to __mem_cgroup_try_charge() if the passed mm is NULL
or init_mm, it will charge the root memcg in either case.

Also fix up the comment in __mem_cgroup_try_charge() that claimed the
init_mm would be charged when no mm was passed.  It's not really
incorrect, but confusing.  Clarify that the root memcg is charged in this
case.
