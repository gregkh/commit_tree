libceph: transition socket state prior to actual connect

Once we call ->connect(), we are racing against the actual
connection, and a subsequent transition from CONNECTING ->
CONNECTED.  Set the state to CONNECTING before that, under the
protection of the mutex, to avoid the race.

This was introduced in 928443cd9644e7cfd46f687dbeffda2d1a357ff9,
with the original socket state code.
