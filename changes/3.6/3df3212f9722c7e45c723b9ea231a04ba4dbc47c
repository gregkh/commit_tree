x86/tlb: add tlb_flushall_shift knob into debugfs

kernel will replace cr3 rewrite with invlpg when
  tlb_flush_entries <= active_tlb_entries / 2^tlb_flushall_factor
if tlb_flushall_factor is -1, kernel won't do this replacement.

User can modify its value according to specific CPU/applications.

Thanks for Borislav providing the help message of
CONFIG_DEBUG_TLBFLUSH.
