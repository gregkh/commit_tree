Btrfs: add DEVICE_READY ioctl

This will be used in conjunction with btrfs device ready <dev>.  This is
needed for initrd's to have a nice and lightweight way to tell if all of the
devices needed for a file system are in the cache currently.  This keeps
them from having to do mount+sleep loops waiting for devices to show up.
