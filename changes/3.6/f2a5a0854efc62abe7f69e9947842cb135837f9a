time: Move arch_gettimeoffset() usage into timekeeping_get_ns()

Since we call arch_gettimeoffset() in all the accessor
functions, move arch_gettimeoffset() calls into
timekeeping_get_ns() and timekeeping_get_ns_raw() to simplify
the code.

This also makes the code easier to maintain as we don't have to
worry about forgetting the arch_gettimeoffset() as has happened
in the past.
