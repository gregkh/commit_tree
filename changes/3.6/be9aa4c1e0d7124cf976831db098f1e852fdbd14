batman-adv: turn tt commit code into routing protocol agnostic API

Prior to this patch the translation table code made assumptions about how
the routing protocol works and where its buffers are stored (to directly
modify them).
Each protocol now calls the tt code with the relevant pointers, thereby
abstracting the code.
