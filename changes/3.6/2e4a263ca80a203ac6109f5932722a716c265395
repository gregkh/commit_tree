ALSA: snd-usb: fix cross-interface streaming devices

Commit 68e67f40b ("ALSA: snd-usb: move calls to usb_set_interface")
saved us some unnecessary calls to snd_usb_set_interface() but ignored
the fact that there is at least one device out there which operates on
two endpoint in different interfaces simultaniously.

Take care for this by catching the case where data and sync endpoints
are located on different interfaces and calling snd_usb_set_interface()
between the start of the two endpoints.
