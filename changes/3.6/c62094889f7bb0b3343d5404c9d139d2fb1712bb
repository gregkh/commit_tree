mac80211: always set in_reconfig=false on wakeup

If the interfaces were removed just before a restart
work was started, open_count will be 0, and most of
the reconfig work will be skipped, including the
resetting of local->in_reconfig to false.

Leaving local->inconfig = true will result in
dropping any incoming packet.

Fix it by always setting local->in_reconfig = false
(even if there are no active interfaces).
