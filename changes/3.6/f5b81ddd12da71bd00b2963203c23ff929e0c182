iio: iio_buffer_register: Skip channels with negative scan index

It is not always the case that all channels can be used in buffered mode. This
patch allows channels, which can not be used in buffered mode, to set their scan
index to a negative number, which will cause iio_buffer_register to ignore the
channel.
