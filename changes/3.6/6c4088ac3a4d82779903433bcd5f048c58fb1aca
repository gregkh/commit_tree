pcdp: use early_ioremap/early_iounmap to access pcdp table

efi_setup_pcdp_console() is called during boot to parse the HCDP/PCDP
EFI system table and setup an early console for printk output.  The
routine uses ioremap/iounmap to setup access to the HCDP/PCDP table
information.

The call to ioremap is happening early in the boot process which leads
to a panic on x86_64 systems:

    panic+0x01ca
    do_exit+0x043c
    oops_end+0x00a7
    no_context+0x0119
    __bad_area_nosemaphore+0x0138
    bad_area_nosemaphore+0x000e
    do_page_fault+0x0321
    page_fault+0x0020
    reserve_memtype+0x02a1
    __ioremap_caller+0x0123
    ioremap_nocache+0x0012
    efi_setup_pcdp_console+0x002b
    setup_arch+0x03a9
    start_kernel+0x00d4
    x86_64_start_reservations+0x012c
    x86_64_start_kernel+0x00fe

This replaces the calls to ioremap/iounmap in efi_setup_pcdp_console()
with calls to early_ioremap/early_iounmap which can be called during
early boot.

This patch was tested on an x86_64 prototype system which uses the
HCDP/PCDP table for early console setup.
