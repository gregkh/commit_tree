netfilter: nf_ct_helper: disable automatic helper re-assignment of different type

This patch modifies __nf_ct_try_assign_helper in a way that invalidates support
for the following scenario:

1) attach the helper A for first time when the conntrack is created
2) attach new (different) helper B due to changes the reply tuple caused by NAT

eg. port redirection from TCP/21 to TCP/5060 with both FTP and SIP helpers
loaded, which seems to be a quite unorthodox scenario.

I can provide a more elaborated patch to support this scenario but explicit
helper attachment provides a better solution for this since now the use can
attach the helpers consistently, without relying on the automatic helper
lookup magic.

This patch fixes a possible out of bound zeroing of the conntrack helper
extension if the helper B uses more memory for its private data than
helper A.
