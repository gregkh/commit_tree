ibmveth: Fix alignment of rx queue bug

This patch fixes a bug found by Nish Aravamudan
(https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/5/15/220) where the driver is not following
the spec (it is not aligning the rx buffer on a 16-byte boundary) and the
hypervisor aborts the registration, making the device unusable.

The fix follows BenH's recommendation (https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/7/20/461)
to replace the kmalloc+map for a single call to dma_alloc_coherent()
because that function always aligns to a 16-byte boundary.

The stable trees will run into this bug whenever the rx buffer kmalloc call
returns something not aligned on a 16-byte boundary.
