net-next: Add netif_get_num_default_rss_queues

Most multi-queue networking driver consider the number of online cpus when
configuring RSS queues.
This patch adds a wrapper to the number of cpus, setting an upper limit on the
number of cpus a driver should consider (by default) when allocating resources
for his queues.
