staging: comedi: cb_das16_cs: fix analog output subdevice init

The analog output subdevice is only available on the -AO version
of the DAS16/16 device and the number of channels is provided in
the boardinfo. Make sure the subdevice is marked as unused for
devices that do not support the analog out.
