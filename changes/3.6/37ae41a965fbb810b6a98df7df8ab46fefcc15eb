bnx2x: Move the CNIC L2 CIDs to be right after the RSS CIDs

Currently the CNIC-related L2 CIDs (for sending control FCoE / iSCSI packets)
were at fixed position, according to the maximal number of RSS queues multiplied
by the number of traffic-classes. This change makes the CIDs dynamic, as they
are defined to be right after the highest RSS CID. This decreases the memory
allocated for the context.
