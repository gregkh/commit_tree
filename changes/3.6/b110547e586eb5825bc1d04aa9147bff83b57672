ARM: OMAP2+: OPP: Fix to ensure check of right oppdef after bad one

Commit 9fa2df6b90786301b175e264f5fa9846aba81a65
(ARM: OMAP2+: OPP: allow OPP enumeration to continue if device is not present)
makes the logic:
for (i = 0; i < opp_def_size; i++) {
	<snip>
	if (!oh || !oh->od) {
		<snip>
		continue;
	}
<snip>
opp_def++;
}

In short, the moment we hit a "Bad OPP", we end up looping the list
comparing against the bad opp definition pointer for the rest of the
iteration count. Instead, increment opp_def in the for loop itself
and allow continue to be used in code without much thought so that
we check the next set of OPP definition pointers :)
