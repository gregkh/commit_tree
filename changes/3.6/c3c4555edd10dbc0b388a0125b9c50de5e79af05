dm table: clear add_random unless all devices have it set

Always clear QUEUE_FLAG_ADD_RANDOM if any underlying device does not
have it set. Otherwise devices with predictable characteristics may
contribute entropy.

QUEUE_FLAG_ADD_RANDOM specifies whether or not queue IO timings
contribute to the random pool.

For bio-based targets this flag is always 0 because such devices have no
real queue.

For request-based devices this flag was always set to 1 by default.

Now set it according to the flags on underlying devices. If there is at
least one device which should not contribute, set the flag to zero: If a
device, such as fast SSD storage, is not suitable for supplying entropy,
a request-based queue stacked over it will not be either.

Because the checking logic is exactly same as for the rotational flag,
share the iteration function with device_is_nonrot().
