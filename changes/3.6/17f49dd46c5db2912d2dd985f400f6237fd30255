staging: comedi: dmm32at: use module_comedi_driver

Convert driver to use the module_comedi_driver() macro to remove
some of the boilerplate.

Move the comedi_driver variable to the end of the file to keep it
with the module_comedi_driver() macro. This also removes the need
for some of the forward declarations. While moving the variable:

1) strip out the unnecessary cut-and-paste skel driver comments
2) add whitespace to improve the readability
3) rename the variable from driver* to *driver
