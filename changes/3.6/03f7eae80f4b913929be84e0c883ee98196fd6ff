edac: remove arch-specific parameter for the error handler

Remove the arch-dependent parameter, as it were not used,
as the MCE tracepoint weren't implemented. It probably doesn't
make sense to have an MCE-specific tracepoint, as this will
cost more bytes at the tracepoint, and tracepoint is not free.

The changes at the EDAC drivers were done by this small perl script:

	$file .=$_ while (<>);
	$file =~ s/(edac_mc_handle_error)\s*\(([^\;]+)\,([^\,\)]+)\s*\)/$1($2)/g;
	print $file;
