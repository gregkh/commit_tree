[SCSI] lpfc: fix problems with -Werror

Commit d38bd3aef ("Add -Werror compilation flag") is causing build breakage
with random gcc incarnations.  These look like gcc problems, but we shouldn't
break the build because of a bad gcc.  Fix this by adding a make flag

WARNINGS_BECOME_ERRORS=1

which is the same as aic7xxx uses so ordinarily the build doesn't use -Werror
