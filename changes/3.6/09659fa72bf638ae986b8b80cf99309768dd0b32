ARM: OMAP3: PM: Move IO Daisychain function to omap3 prm file

Since IO Daisychain modifies only PRM registers, it makes sense to move
it to PRM File. Also changed the timeout value for IO chain enable to
100us and added a wait for status disable at the end.

Thanks to Nishanth Menon <nm@ti.com> for contributing a fix to the
timeout code waiting for WUCLKOUT to go high.

[paul@pwsan.com: renamed omap3_trigger_io_chain() to better describe the
 end result and to match other PRM functions; removed
 omap3_disable_io_chain(); moved MAX_IOPAD_LATCH_TIME to prcm-common as it
 will also be used by the OMAP4 code; removed unnecessary barrier;
 added kerneldoc; added credit for fix from Nishanth]
