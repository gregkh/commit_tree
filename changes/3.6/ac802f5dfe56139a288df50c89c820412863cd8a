ixgbe: Move configuration of set_real_num_rx/tx_queues into open

It makes much more sense for us to configure the real number of Tx and Rx
queues in the ixgbe_open call than it does in ixgbe_set_num_queues.  By
setting the number in ixgbe_open we can avoid a number of unecessary
updates and only have to make the calls once.
