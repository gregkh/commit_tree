uprobes: Fix register_for_each_vma()->vma_address() check

1. register_for_each_vma() checks that vma_address() == vaddr,
   but this is not enough. We should also ensure that
   vaddr >= vm_start, find_vma() guarantees "vaddr < vm_end" only.

2. After the prevous changes, register_for_each_vma() is the
   only reason why vma_address() has to return loff_t, all other
   users know that we have the valid mapping at this offset and
   thus the overflow is not possible.

   Change the code to use vaddr_to_offset() instead, imho this looks
   more clean/understandable and now we can change vma_address().

3. While at it, remove the unnecessary type-cast.
