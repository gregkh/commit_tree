[SCSI] libata, libsas: introduce sched_eh and end_eh port ops

When managing shost->host_eh_scheduled libata assumes that there is a
1:1 shost-to-ata_port relationship.  libsas creates a 1:N relationship
so it needs to manage host_eh_scheduled cumulatively at the host level.
The sched_eh and end_eh port port ops allow libsas to track when domain
devices enter/leave the "eh-pending" state under ha->lock (previously
named ha->state_lock, but it is no longer just a lock for ha->state
changes).

Since host_eh_scheduled indicates eh without backing commands pinning
the device it can be deallocated at any time.  Move the taking of the
domain_device reference under the port_lock to guarantee that the
ata_port stays around for the duration of eh.
