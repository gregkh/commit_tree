cgroup: cgroup_rm_files() was calling simple_unlink() with the wrong inode

While refactoring cgroup file removal path, 05ef1d7c4a "cgroup:
introduce struct cfent" incorrectly changed the @dir argument of
simple_unlink() to the inode of the file being deleted instead of that
of the containing directory.

The effect of this bug is minor - ctime and mtime of the parent
weren't properly updated on file deletion.

Fix it by using @cgrp->dentry->d_inode instead.
