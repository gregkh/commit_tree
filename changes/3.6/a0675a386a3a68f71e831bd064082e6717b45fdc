IB/mlx4: Check iboe netdev pointer before dereferencing it

Unlike other parts of the mlx4_ib code, the function build_mlx_header()
doesn't check if the iboe netdev of the given port is valid before
dereferencing it, which can cause a crash if the ethernet interface
has already been taken down.

Fix this by checking for a valid netdev pointer before using it to get
the port MAC address.
