bnx2x: Fix recovery flow cleanup during probe

During probe, every function probed clears the recovery registers from
all functions on its path - thus signaling that given a future recovery
event, there will be no need to wait for those functions.

This is a flawed behaviour - each function should only be responsible
for its own bit.

Since this registers are handled during the load/unload routines,
this cleanup is removed altogether.
