wlcore: add probe request templates for sched and one-shot scans

The driver configures the firmware template for probe requests during
the scan process.  If the same template is used for one-shot and sched
scans they will override each other when running scans simultaneously.

This fix works only on firmwares later than X.3.9.2.112 for single
role and X.3.9.2.23 for multi-role.

[Some cleaning-up and renaming of the quirk to something smaller --
Luca.]
