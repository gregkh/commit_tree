can: sja1000_platform: fix wrong flag IRQF_SHARED for interrupt sharing

The sja1000 platform driver wrongly assumes that a shared IRQ is indicated
with the IRQF_SHARED flag in irq resource flags. This patch changes the
driver to handle the correct flag IORESOURCE_IRQ_SHAREABLE instead.

There are no mainline users of the platform driver which wrongly make use
of IRQF_SHARED.
