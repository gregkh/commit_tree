drm/i915: don't hang userspace when the gpu reset is stuck

With the gpu reset no longer using a trylock we've increased the
chances of userspace getting stuck quite a bit. To make that
(hopefully) rare case more paletable time out when waiting for the gpu
reset code to complete and signal this little issue to the caller by
returning -EIO.

This should help userspace to somewhat gracefully fall back and
hopefully allow the user to grab some logs and reboot the machine
(instead of staring at a frozen X screen in agony).

Suggested by Chris Wilson because I've been stubborn about allowing
the gpu reset code no to fail, ever (by removing the trylock).
