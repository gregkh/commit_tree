Revert "ARM: OMAP3530evm: set pendown_state and debounce time for ads7846"

1) The above commit introduced a common ->get_pendown_state() function
into the generic code, but that function was board-specific for the
OMAP3EVM and thus broke most other boards using this code.

2) The above commit was mis-merged introducing another bug which
prevents the ads7846 driver probe function to succeed.
The omap_ads7846_init() function frees the pendown GPIO in case there is
no ->get_pendown_state() function set by the caller (board specific
code), so it can be requested later by the ads7846 driver.
The above commit add a common ->get_pendown_state() function without
removing the gpio_free() call and thus once the ads7846 driver tries
to use the pendown GPIO, it crashes as the pendown GPIO has not been
requested.

3) The above commit introduces NO new functionality as
get_pendown_state() function is already implemented in a suitable way by
the ads7846 driver and the debounce time handling has already been
fixed by commit 97ee9f01 (ARM: OMAP: fix the ads7846 init code).

This reverts commit 16aced80f6739beb2a6ff7b6f96c83ba80d331e8.

Solved by taking the working version prior to the above commit.
