mm: swapfile: clean up unuse_pte race handling

The conditional mem_cgroup_cancel_charge_swapin() is a leftover from when
the function would continue to reestablish the page even after
mem_cgroup_try_charge_swapin() failed.  After 85d9fc8 "memcg: fix refcnt
handling at swapoff", the condition is always true when this code is
reached.
