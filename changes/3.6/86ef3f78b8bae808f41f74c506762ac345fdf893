[media] radio-si470x: Don't unnecesarily read registers on G_TUNER

Reading registers from the pcear USB dongles with the si470x causes a
loud pop (and an alsa buffer overrun). Since most radio apps periodically
call G_TUNER to update mono/stereo, signal and afc status this leads
to the music . pop . music . pop . music -> not good.

On the internet there is an howto for flashing the pcear with a newer
firmware from the silabs reference boardto fix this, but:
1) This howto relies on a special version of the driver which allows
   firmware flashing
2) We should try to avoid the answer to a bug report being upgrade your
   firmware, if at all possible
3) Windows does not suffer from the pop sounds

After a quick look at the driver I found at that the register reads are
not necessary at all, as the device gives us the necessary status through
usb interrupt packets, and the driver already uses these!
