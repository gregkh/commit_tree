sched/x86: Remove broken power estimation

The x86 sched power implementation has been broken forever and gets in
the way of other stuff, remove it.

[ For archaeological interest, fixing this code would require dealing
  with the cross-cpu calling of these functions and more importantly, we
  need to filter idle time out of the a/m-perf stuff because the ratio
  will go down to 0 when idle, giving a 0 capacity which is not what
  we'd want. ]
