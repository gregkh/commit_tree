Bluetooth: Refactor l2cap_ertm_send

The new implementation is aware of the new transmit state machine, and
uses struct l2cap_ctrl to compose ERTM headers.  It also has improved
error handling for allocation failures, and does not send the packet
until after all skb and channel data structures are updated.
