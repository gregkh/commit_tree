OMAPDSS: SDI: Configure dss_lcd_mgr_config struct with lcd manager parameters

Create a dss_lcd_mgr_config struct instance in SDI. Fill up all the parameters
of the struct with configurations held by the panel, and the configurations
required by SDI.

Use these to write to the DISPC registers. These direct register writes would be
later replaced by a function which applies the configuration using the shadow
register programming model.

Create function sdi_config_lcd_manager() which fills the mgr_config parameters
and writes to the DISPC registers.
