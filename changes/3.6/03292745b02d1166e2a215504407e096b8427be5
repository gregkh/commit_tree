netlink: add nlk->netlink_bind hook for module auto-loading

This patch adds a hook in the binding path of netlink.

This is used by ctnetlink to allow module autoloading for the case
in which one user executes:

 conntrack -E

So far, this resulted in nfnetlink loaded, but not
nf_conntrack_netlink.

I have received in the past many complains on this behaviour.
