alpha: Use new generic strncpy_from_user() and strnlen_user()

Similar to x86/sparc/powerpc implementations except:
1) we implement an extremely efficient has_zero()/find_zero()
   sequence with both prep_zero_mask() and create_zero_mask()
   no-operations.
2) Our output from prep_zero_mask() differs in that only the
   lowest eight bits are used to represent the zero bytes
   nevertheless it can be safely ORed with other similar masks
   from prep_zero_mask() and forms input to create_zero_mask(),
   the two fundamental properties prep_zero_mask() must satisfy.

Tests on EV67 and EV68 CPUs revealed that the generic code is
essentially as fast (to within 0.5% of CPU cycles) of the old
Alpha specific code for large quadword-aligned strings, despite
the 30% extra CPU instructions executed.  In contrast, the
generic code for unaligned strings is substantially slower (by
more than a factor of 3) than the old Alpha specific code.
