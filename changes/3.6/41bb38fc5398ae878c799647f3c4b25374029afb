tile pci: enable IOMMU to support DMA for legacy devices

This change uses the TRIO IOMMU to map the PCI DMA space and physical
memory at different addresses.  We also now use the dma_mapping_ops
to provide support for non-PCI DMA, PCIe DMA (64-bit) and legacy PCI
DMA (32-bit).  We use the kernel's software I/O TLB framework
(i.e. bounce buffers) for the legacy 32-bit PCI device support since
there are a limited number of TLB entries in the IOMMU and it is
non-trivial to handle indexing, searching, matching, etc.  For 32-bit
devices the performance impact of bounce buffers should not be a concern.
