xhci: Switch PPT ports to EHCI on shutdown.

The Intel desktop boards DH77EB and DH77DF have a hardware issue that
can be worked around by BIOS.  If the USB ports are switched to xHCI on
shutdown, the xHCI host will send a spurious interrupt, which will wake
the system.  Some BIOS will work around this, but not all.

The bug can be avoided if the USB ports are switched back to EHCI on
shutdown.  The Intel Windows driver switches the ports back to EHCI, so
change the Linux xHCI driver to do the same.

Unfortunately, we can't tell the two effected boards apart from other
working motherboards, because the vendors will change the DMI strings
for the DH77EB and DH77DF boards to their own custom names.  One example
is Compulab's mini-desktop, the Intense-PC.  Instead, key off the
Panther Point xHCI host PCI vendor and device ID, and switch the ports
over for all PPT xHCI hosts.

The only impact this will have on non-effected boards is to add a couple
hundred milliseconds delay on boot when the BIOS has to switch the ports
over from EHCI to xHCI.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 3.0, that contain
the commit 69e848c2090aebba5698a1620604c7dccb448684 "Intel xhci: Support
EHCI/xHCI port switching."
