ASoC: fsl: remove unneeded AUDMUX register setting from imx-sgtl5000

If we don't set IMX_AUDMUX_V2_PTCR_TCLKDIR in the AUDMUX PTCR
register (means Tx clock pin is input), we don't need to set
IMX_AUDMUX_V2_PTCR_TCSEL as well. Since both i.MX35, i.MX51 and
i.MX6 datasheet says "When Tx clock pin set as an input, the TCSEL
settings are ignored".
