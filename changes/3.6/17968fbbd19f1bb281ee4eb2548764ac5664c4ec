powerpc: 64bit optimised __clear_user

I noticed __clear_user high up in a profile of one of my RAID stress
tests. The testcase was doing a dd from /dev/zero which ends up
calling __clear_user.

__clear_user is basically a loop with a single 4 byte store which
is horribly slow. We can do much better by aligning the desination
and doing 32 bytes of 8 byte stores in a loop.

The following testcase was used to verify the patch:

To show the improvement in performance I ran a dd from /dev/zero
to /dev/null on a POWER7 box:

Before:

# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1M count=10000
10485760000 bytes (10 GB) copied, 3.72379 s, 2.8 GB/s

After:

# time dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null bs=1M count=10000
10485760000 bytes (10 GB) copied, 0.728318 s, 14.4 GB/s

Over 5x faster.
