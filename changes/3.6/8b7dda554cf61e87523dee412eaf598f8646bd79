usb: gadget: at91udc: don't overwrite driver data

The driver was converted to the new start/stop interface in f3d8bf34c2
("usb: gadget: at91_udc: convert to new style start/stop interface").
I overlooked that the driver is overwritting the private data which is
used by the composite framework. The udc driver doesn't read it, it is
only written here.
