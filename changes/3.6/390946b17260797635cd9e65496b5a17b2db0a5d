i2c-core: Fix for lockdep validator

If kernel is compiled with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING the
validator raises an error when a multiplexer is removed
via sysfs and sub-clients are connected to it. This is a
false positive.
Documentation/lockdep-design.txt recommends to handle this
via calls to mutex_lock_nested().

Based on an earlier fix from Michael Lawnick.

Note that the extra code resolves to nothing unless
CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y.
