libceph: delay debugfs initialization until we learn global_id

The debugfs directory includes the cluster fsid and our unique global_id.
We need to delay the initialization of the debug entry until we have
learned both the fsid and our global_id from the monitor or else the
second client can't create its debugfs entry and will fail (and multiple
client instances aren't properly reflected in debugfs).
