arm/dts: New dts file for PandaBoardES (4460)

The 4430 and 4460 version of PandaBoard mostly the same with
exception at least in audio setup.
Use the omap4-panda.dts file as a base and only override the differences
between the revisions.
For audio it is the name of the sound card and the routing information.
