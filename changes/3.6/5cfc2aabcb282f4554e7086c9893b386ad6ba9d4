KVM: handle last_boosted_vcpu = 0 case

If last_boosted_vcpu == 0, then we fall through all test cases and
may end up with all VCPUs pouncing on vcpu 0.  With a large enough
guest, this can result in enormous runqueue lock contention, which
can prevent vcpu0 from running, leading to a livelock.

Changing < to <= makes sure we properly handle that case.
