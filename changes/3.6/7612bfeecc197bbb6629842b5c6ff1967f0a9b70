Yama: access task_struct->comm directly

The core ptrace access checking routine holds a task lock, and when
reporting a failure, Yama takes a separate task lock. To avoid a
potential deadlock with two ptracers taking the opposite locks, do not
use get_task_comm() and just use ->comm directly since accuracy is not
important for the report.
