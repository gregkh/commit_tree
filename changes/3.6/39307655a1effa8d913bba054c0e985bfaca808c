nfsd4: fix security flavor of NFSv4.0 callback

Commit d5497fc693a446ce9100fcf4117c3f795ddfd0d2 "nfsd4: move rq_flavor
into svc_cred" forgot to remove cl_flavor from the client, leaving two
places (cl_flavor and cl_cred.cr_flavor) for the flavor to be stored.
After that patch, the latter was the one that was updated, but the
former was the one that the callback used.

Symptoms were a long delay on utime().  This is because the utime()
generated a setattr which recalled a delegation, but the cb_recall was
ignored by the client because it had the wrong security flavor.
