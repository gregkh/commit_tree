cfg80211: clarify set_channel APIs

Now that we've removed all uses of the set_channel
API except for the monitor channel and in libertas,
clarify this. Split the libertas mesh use into a
new libertas_set_mesh_channel() operation, just to
keep backward compatibility, and rename the normal
set_channel() to set_monitor_channel().

Also describe the desired set_monitor_channel()
semantics more clearly.
