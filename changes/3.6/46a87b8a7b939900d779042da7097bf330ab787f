NFS: When state recovery fails, waiting tasks should exit

NFSv4 state recovery is not always successful.  Failure is signalled
by setting the nfs_client.cl_cons_state to a negative (errno) value,
then waking waiters.

Currently this can happen only during mount processing.  I'm about to
add an explicit case where state recovery failure during normal
operation should force all NFS requests waiting on that state recovery
to exit.
