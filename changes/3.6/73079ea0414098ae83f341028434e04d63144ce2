ixgbe: Add support for SR-IOV w/ DCB or RSS

This change essentially makes it so that we can enable almost all of the
features all at once.  This patch allows for the combination of SR-IOV,
DCB, and FCoE in the case of the x540.  It also beefs up the SR-IOV by
adding support for RSS to the PF.

The testing matrix gets to be very complex for this patch as there are a
number of different features and subsets for queueing options.  I tried to
narrow these down a bit by restricting the PF to only supporting 4TC DCB
when it is enabled in addition to SR-IOV.
