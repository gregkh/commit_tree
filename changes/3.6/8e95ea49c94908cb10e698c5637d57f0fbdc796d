cfg80211: fix locking and lockdep complaints

To call cfg80211_get_chan_state() we need to lock
the wdev, so we need to lock the wdev_iter mutex
in cfg80211_can_use_iftype_chan(). This needs to
use nested locking for lockdep.

Also, cfg80211_get_chan_state() doesn't actually
use the rdev, so remove that completely including
the lock assertion that isn't needed.
