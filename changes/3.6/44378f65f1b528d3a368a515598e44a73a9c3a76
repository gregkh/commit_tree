staging: comedi: das08_cs: remove unused pcmcia 'stop' logic

The pcmcia support code in this driver is cut-and-paste from the
dummy_cs.c driver of the Linux PCMCIA Card Services package. It
has code in it to stop the device during suspend but nothing in
the main comedi_driver uses it.

Remove the 'stop' variable from the pcmcia private data and all
the logic that deals with it.
