tcm_vhost: Fix vhost_scsi_target structure alignment

Here TRANSPORT_IQN_LEN is 224, which is a multiple of 4.
Since vhost_tpgt is 2 bytes and abi_version is 4, the total size would
be 230.  But gcc needs struct size be aligned to first field size, which
is 4 bytes, so it pads the structure by extra 2 bytes to the total of
232.

This padding is very undesirable in an ABI:
- it can not be initialized easily
- it can not be checked easily
- it can leak information between kernel and userspace

Simplest solution is probably just to make the padding
explicit.

(v2: Add check for zero'ed backend->reserved field for VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT
     and VHOST_SCSI_CLEAR_ENDPOINT ops as requested by MST)
