USB: remove 8 bytes of padding from usb_host_interface on 64 bit builds

Reorder elements in the usb_host_interface structure to remove 8 bytes
of padding on 64 bit builds , and so shrink it's size to 40 bytes.

usb_interface_descriptor is a odd size which leaves a gap that is not
big enough to hold a pointer, so moving extralen into that gap removes
the need for more padding.
