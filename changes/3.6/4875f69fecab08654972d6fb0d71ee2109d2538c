arch/tile: provide kernel support for the tilegx mPIPE shim

The TILE-Gx chip includes a packet-processing network engine called
mPIPE ("Multicore Programmable Intelligent Packet Engine").  This
change adds support for using the mPIPE engine from within the
kernel.  The engine has more functionality than is exposed here,
but to keep the kernel code and binary simpler, this is a subset
of the full API designed to enable standard Linux networking only.
