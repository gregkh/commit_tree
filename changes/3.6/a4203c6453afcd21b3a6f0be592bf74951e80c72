wlcore: wait for roc complete only for the first roc command

In some multi role scenarios the driver might send multi
roc requests without sending a croc first, the fw queues
those requests and starts service the next roc request as
soon as the driver sends a croc for the previous one. So,
if the fw rocs on channel X and driver asks to roc also
on channel Y, the fw will not start service Y (and will
not send roc complete event for this request) until the
driver releases the fw with croc X.
