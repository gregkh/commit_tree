hugetlb: rename max_hstate to hugetlb_max_hstate

This patchset implements a cgroup resource controller for HugeTLB pages.
The controller allows to limit the HugeTLB usage per control group and
enforces the controller limit during page fault.  Since HugeTLB doesn't
support page reclaim, enforcing the limit at page fault time implies that,
the application will get SIGBUS signal if it tries to access HugeTLB pages
beyond its limit.  This requires the application to know beforehand how
much HugeTLB pages it would require for its use.

The goal is to control how many HugeTLB pages a group of task can
allocate.  It can be looked at as an extension of the existing quota
interface which limits the number of HugeTLB pages per hugetlbfs
superblock.  HPC job scheduler requires jobs to specify their resource
requirements in the job file.  Once their requirements can be met, job
schedulers like (SLURM) will schedule the job.  We need to make sure that
the jobs won't consume more resources than requested.  If they do we
should either error out or kill the application.

This patch:

Rename max_hstate to hugetlb_max_hstate.  We will be using this from other
subsystems like hugetlb controller in later patches.
