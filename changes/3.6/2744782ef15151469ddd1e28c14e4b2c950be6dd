[media] soc-camera: Pass the physical device to the power operation

There will be no soc_camera_device instance with a soc-camera device is
used with a non soc-camera host, so we won't be able to pass the
soc_camera_device fake platform device to board code. Pass the physical
device instead.

The argument is currently not used by any board file so this is safe.
