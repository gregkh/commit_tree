ext4: don't take the i_mutex lock when doing DIO overwrites

Aligned and overwrite direct I/O can be parallelized.  In
ext4_file_dio_write, we first check whether these conditions are
satisfied or not.  If so, we take i_data_sem and release i_mutex lock
directly.  Meanwhile iocb->private is set to indicate that this is a
dio overwrite, and it will be handled in ext4_ext_direct_IO.

[ Added fix from Dan Carpenter to fix locking bug on the error path. ]
