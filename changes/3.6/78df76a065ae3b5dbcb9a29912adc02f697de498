ipv4: take rt_uncached_lock only if needed

Multicast traffic allocates dst with DST_NOCACHE, but dst is
not inserted into rt_uncached_list.

This slowdown multicast workloads on SMP because rt_uncached_lock is
contended.

Change the test before taking the lock to actually check the dst
was inserted into rt_uncached_list.
