can: flexcan: add hardware controller version support

At least in the i.MX series, the flexcan contrller divides into ver_3
and ver_10, current driver is for ver_3 controller.

i.MX6 has ver_10 controller, it has more reigsters than ver_3 has.
The rxfgmask (Rx FIFO Global Mask) register is one of the new added.
Its reset value is 0xffffffff, this means ID Filter Table must be
checked when receive a packet, but the driver is designed to accept
everything during the chip start, we need to clear this register to
follow this design.

Use the data entry of the struct of_device_id to point chip specific
info, we can set hardware version for each platform.
