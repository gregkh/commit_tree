sungem: remove unnecessary setting of skb->dev

skb->dev is being unnecessarily set by the driver's skb alloc routine (which is
called in init and during rx).  It is already being set to the proper value when
eth_type_trans is called on packet receive, and the skb->dev is not referenced
anywhere else in the code.
