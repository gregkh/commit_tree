ALSA: HDA: Create phantom jacks for fixed inputs and outputs

PulseAudio sometimes have difficulties knowing that there is a
"Speaker" or "Internal Mic", if they have no individual volume
controls or selectors. As a result, only e g "Headphone" might
be created for a laptop, but no "Speaker".
To help out, create phantom jacks (that are always present,
at least for now) for "Speaker", "Internal Mic" etc, in case we
detect them.
The naming convention is e g "Speaker Phantom Jack".

In order not to pollute the /dev/input namespace with even more
devices, these are added to the kcontrols only, not the input devices.
