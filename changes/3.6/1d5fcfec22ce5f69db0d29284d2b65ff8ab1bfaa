PM / Domains: Add device domain data reference counter

Add a mechanism for counting references to the
struct generic_pm_domain_data object pointed to by
dev->power.subsys_data->domain_data if the device in question
belongs to a generic PM domain.

This change is necessary for a subsequent patch making it possible to
allocate that object from within pm_genpd_add_callbacks(), so that
drivers can attach their PM domain device callbacks to devices before
those devices are added to PM domains.

This patch has been tested on the SH7372 Mackerel board.
