igb: Update firmware info output

Our NVM image creation tools have evolved over the years and there are
multiple versions contained in them, depending on the tool used to create
them.  This patch outputs the NVM versions available in ethtool -i output.

rc2: (not sure why others show in log but not in the message)
     Added additional call to igb_set_fw_version per Community feedback.
