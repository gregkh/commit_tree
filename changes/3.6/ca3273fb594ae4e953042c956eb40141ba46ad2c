ALSA: wss_lib: fix suspend/resume

By setting SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME, wss_lib claims that it can restore the card
state fully on resume. But in fact, it can't as DMA is not restored so any
playback/capture running during suspend will fail to continue after resume.

Remove SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME flag from pcm info field to fix the problem.
