SUNRPC/cache: fix reporting of expired cache entries in 'content' file.

Entries that are in a sunrpc cache but are not valid should be reported
with a leading '#' so they look like a comment.
Commit  d202cce8963d9 (sunrpc: never return expired entries in sunrpc_cache_lookup)
broke this for expired entries.

This particularly applies to entries that have been replaced by newer entries.
sunrpc_cache_update sets the expiry of the replaced entry to '0', but it
remains in the cache until the next 'cache_clean'.
The result is that if you

  echo 0 2000000000 1 0 > /proc/net/rpc/auth.unix.gid/channel

several times, then

  cat /proc/net/rpc/auth.unix.gid/content

It will display multiple entries for the one uid, which is at least confusing:

  #uid cnt: gids...
  0 1: 0
  0 1: 0
  0 1: 0

With this patch, expired entries are marked as comments so you get

  #uid cnt: gids...
  0 1: 0
  # 0 1: 0
  # 0 1: 0

These expired entries will never be seen by cache_check() as they are always
*after* a non-expired entry with the same key - so the extra check is only
needed in c_show()

It's not a big problem, but it had me confused for a while, so it could
well confuse others.
