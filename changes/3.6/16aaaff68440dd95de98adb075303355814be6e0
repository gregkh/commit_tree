powerpc/pseries/cpuidle: Replace pseries_notify_cpuidle_add call with notifier

The following patch is to remove the pseries_notify_add_cpu() call
and replace it by a hot plug notifier.

This would prevent cpuidle resources being released and allocated each
time cpu comes online on pseries.

The earlier design was causing a lockdep problem
in start_secondary as reported on this thread
	-https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/5/17/2

This applies on 3.4-rc7
