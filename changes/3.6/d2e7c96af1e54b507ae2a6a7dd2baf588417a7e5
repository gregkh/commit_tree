random: mix in architectural randomness in extract_buf()

Mix in any architectural randomness in extract_buf() instead of
xfer_secondary_buf().  This allows us to mix in more architectural
randomness, and it also makes xfer_secondary_buf() faster, moving a
tiny bit of additional CPU overhead to process which is extracting the
randomness.
