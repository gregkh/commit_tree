staging: comedi: ni_daq_700: remove unused pcmcia 'stop' logic

The pcmcia support code in this driver appears to be cut-and-
paste from some other driver. It has code in it to stop the
device during suspend but nothing in the main comedi_driver
uses it.

Remove the 'stop' variable from the pcmcia private data and
all the logic that deals with it.
