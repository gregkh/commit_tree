ARM: SAMSUNG: remove unused SPI clock headers

Commit 875a59374cd10200ac24f03877ccd8f73af590cc ("ARM: SAMSUNG:
Consolidation of SPI platform devices to plat-samsung") deleted all
(four) files that included one of the "spi-clocks.h" headers. It seems
it was just an oversight to not remove those headers too. They can
safely be removed now.
