pstore: Introduce write_buf backend callback

For function tracing we need to stop using pstore.buf directly, since
in a tracing callback we can't use spinlocks, and thus we can't safely
use the global buffer.

With write_buf callback, backends no longer need to access pstore.buf
directly, and thus we can pass any buffers (e.g. allocated on stack).
