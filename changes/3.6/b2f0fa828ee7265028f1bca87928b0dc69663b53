mfd/asic3: fix asic3_mfd_probe return value

In commit 4f304245b "mfd: Set asic3 DS1WM clock_rate", a possible
path through asic3_mfd_probe was introduced that would lead to
an unpredictable return value, if everything succeeds but there
are pdata->leds is NULL. This was reported correctly by gcc.

Without this patch, building magician_defconfig results in:

drivers/mfd/asic3.c: In function 'asic3_mfd_probe':
drivers/mfd/asic3.c:940:2: warning: 'ret' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
