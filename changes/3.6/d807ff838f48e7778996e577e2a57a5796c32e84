autofs4 - fix expire check

In some cases when an autofs indirect mount is contained in a file
system that is marked as shared (such as when systemd does the
equivalent of "mount --make-rshared /" early in the boot), mounts
stop expiring.

When this happens the first expiry check on a mountpoint dentry in
autofs_expire_indirect() sees a mountpoint dentry with a higher
than minimal reference count. Consequently the dentry is condidered
busy and the actual expiry check is never done.

This particular check was originally meant as an optimisation to
detect a path walk in progress but with the addition of rcu-walk
it can be ineffective anyway.

Removing the test allows automounts to expire again since the
actual expire check doesn't rely on the dentry reference count.
