iio:trigger: Register sysfs file statically

The name sysfs attribute is the same for all triggers, so there is no need to
register them dynamically at runtime. Create a attribute group for it and set it
up for the bus attribute group. This also avoids a possible race condition
where the uevent for the device is sent before the name sysfs attribute has been
added.
