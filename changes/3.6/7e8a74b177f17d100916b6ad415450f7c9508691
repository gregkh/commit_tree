[SCSI] scsi_dh: add scsi_dh_attached_handler_name

Introduce scsi_dh_attached_handler_name() to retrieve the name of the
scsi_dh that is attached to the scsi_device associated with the provided
request queue.  Returns NULL if a scsi_dh is not attached.

Also, fix scsi_dh_{attach,detach} function header comments to document
@q rather than @sdev.
