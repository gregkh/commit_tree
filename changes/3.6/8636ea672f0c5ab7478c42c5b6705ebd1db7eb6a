libceph: avoid dropping con mutex before fault

The ceph_fault() function takes the con mutex, so we should avoid
dropping it before calling it.  This fixes a potential race with
another thread calling ceph_con_close(), or _open(), or similar (we
don't reverify con->state after retaking the lock).

Add annotation so that lockdep realizes we will drop the mutex before
returning.
