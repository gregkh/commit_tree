block: do not artificially constrain max_sectors for stacking drivers

blk_set_stacking_limits is intended to allow stacking drivers to build
up the limits of the stacked device based on the underlying devices'
limits.  But defaulting 'max_sectors' to BLK_DEF_MAX_SECTORS (1024)
doesn't allow the stacking driver to inherit a max_sectors larger than
1024 -- due to blk_stack_limits' use of min_not_zero.

It is now clear that this artificial limit is getting in the way so
change blk_set_stacking_limits's max_sectors to UINT_MAX (which allows
stacking drivers like dm-multipath to inherit 'max_sectors' from the
underlying paths).
