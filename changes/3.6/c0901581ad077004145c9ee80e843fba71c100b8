Btrfs: avoid I/O repair BUG() from btree_read_extent_buffer_pages()

From btree_read_extent_buffer_pages(), currently repair_io_failure()
can be called with mirror_num being zero when submit_one_bio() returned
an error before. This used to cause a BUG_ON(!mirror_num) in
repair_io_failure() and indeed this is not a case that needs the I/O
repair code to rewrite disk blocks.
This commit prevents calling repair_io_failure() in this case and thus
avoids the BUG_ON() and malfunction.
