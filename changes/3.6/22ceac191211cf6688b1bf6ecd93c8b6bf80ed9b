xhci: Increase reset timeout for Renesas 720201 host.

The NEC/Renesas 720201 xHCI host controller does not complete its reset
within 250 milliseconds.  In fact, it takes about 9 seconds to reset the
host controller, and 1 second for the host to be ready for doorbell
rings.  Extend the reset and CNR polling timeout to 10 seconds each.

This patch should be backported to kernels as old as 2.6.31, that
contain the commit 66d4eadd8d067269ea8fead1a50fe87c2979a80d "USB: xhci:
BIOS handoff and HW initialization."
