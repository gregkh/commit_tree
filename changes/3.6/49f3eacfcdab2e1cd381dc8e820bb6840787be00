spi/s3c64xx: Fix handling of errors in gpio_request()

When gpio_request() fails the driver logged the failure but while it'd
try to print an error code in the non-DT case it didn't pass the error
code in so garbage would be logged and in the DT case the error wasn't
logged.

Further, in the non-DT case the error code was then overwritten with -EBUSY
depriving the caller of information and breaking automatic probe deferral
pushing back from the GPIO level.  Also reformat the non-DT log message
so it's not word wrapped and we can grep for it.
