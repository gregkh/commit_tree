[SCSI] Fix device removal NULL pointer dereference

Use blk_queue_dead() to test whether the queue is dead instead
of !sdev. Since scsi_prep_fn() may be invoked concurrently with
__scsi_remove_device(), keep the queuedata (sdev) pointer in
__scsi_remove_device(). This patch fixes a kernel oops that
can be triggered by USB device removal. See also
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg56254.html.

Other changes included in this patch:
- Swap the blk_cleanup_queue() and kfree() calls in
  scsi_host_dev_release() to make that code easier to grasp.
- Remove the queue dead check from scsi_run_queue() since the
  queue state can change anyway at any point in that function
  where the queue lock is not held.
- Remove the queue dead check from the start of scsi_request_fn()
  since it is redundant with the scsi_device_online() check.
