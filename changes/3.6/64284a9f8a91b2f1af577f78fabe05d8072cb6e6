ARM: 7454/1: entry: don't bother with syscall tracing on ret_from_fork path

ret_from_fork is setup for a freshly spawned child task via copy_thread,
called from copy_process. The latter function clears TIF_SYSCALL_TRACE
and also resets the child task's audit_context to NULL, meaning that
there is little point invoking the system call tracing routines.
Furthermore, getting hold of the syscall number is a complete pain and
it looks like the current code doesn't even bother.

This patch removes the syscall tracing checks from ret_from_fork.
