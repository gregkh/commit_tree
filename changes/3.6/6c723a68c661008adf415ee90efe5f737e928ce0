IB/ipoib: Fix RCU pointer dereference of wrong object

Commit b63b70d87741 ("IPoIB: Use a private hash table for path lookup
in xmit path") introduced a bug where in ipoib_neigh_free() (which is
called from a few errors flows in the driver), rcu_dereference() is
invoked with the wrong pointer object, which results in a crash.
