tcp: restore rcv_wscale in a repair mode (v2)

rcv_wscale is a symetric parameter with snd_wscale.

Both this parameters are set on a connection handshake.

Without this value a remote window size can not be interpreted correctly,
because a value from a packet should be shifted on rcv_wscale.

And one more thing is that wscale_ok should be set too.

This patch doesn't break a backward compatibility.
If someone uses it in a old scheme, a rcv window
will be restored with the same bug (rcv_wscale = 0).

v2: Save backward compatibility on big-endian system. Before
    the first two bytes were snd_wscale and the second two bytes were
    rcv_wscale. Now snd_wscale is opt_val & 0xFFFF and rcv_wscale >> 16.
    This approach is independent on byte ordering.
