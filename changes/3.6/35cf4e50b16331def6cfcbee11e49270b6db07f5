sched,cgroup: Fix up task_groups list

With multiple instances of task_groups, for_each_rt_rq() is a noop,
no task groups having been added to the rt.c list instance.  This
renders __enable/disable_runtime() and print_rt_stats() noop, the
user (non) visible effect being that rt task groups are missing in
/proc/sched_debug.
