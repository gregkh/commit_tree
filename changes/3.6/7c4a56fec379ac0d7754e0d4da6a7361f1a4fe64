tcp: fix cwnd reduction for non-sack recovery

The cwnd reduction in fast recovery is based on the number of packets
newly delivered per ACK. For non-sack connections every DUPACK
signifies a packet has been delivered, but the sender mistakenly
skips counting them for cwnd reduction.

The fix is to compute newly_acked_sacked after DUPACKs are accounted
in sacked_out for non-sack connections.
