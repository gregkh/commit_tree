tmpfs: distribute interleave better across nodes

When tmpfs has the interleave memory policy, it always starts allocating
for each file from node 0 at offset 0.  When there are many small files,
the lower nodes fill up disproportionately.

This patch spreads out node usage by starting files at nodes other than 0,
by using the inode number to bias the starting node for interleave.
