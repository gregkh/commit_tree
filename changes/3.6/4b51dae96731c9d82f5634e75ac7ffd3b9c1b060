Bluetooth: Add streaming mode receive and incoming packet classifier

Streaming mode reception is fairly simple, with in-sequence frames
being reassembled as they arrive.  Out-of-sequence frames are dropped,
and also clear any partially-assembled SDUs that may exist.

The packet classifier determines if the txseq value of the incoming
packet is expected, invalid (resulting in a disconnection), invalid
(ignorable), duplicate, or having to do with an SREJ request that was
previously sent.  The rules for each classification are defined in the
ERTM specification, and consolidating these rules in one place helps
clarify the receive state machine.
