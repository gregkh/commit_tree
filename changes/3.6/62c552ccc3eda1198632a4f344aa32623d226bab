PM / Hibernate: Enable suspend to both for in-kernel hibernation.

It is often useful to suspend to memory after hibernation image has been
written to disk. If the battery runs out or power is otherwise lost, the
computer will resume from the hibernated image. If not, it will resume
from memory and hibernation image will be discarded.
