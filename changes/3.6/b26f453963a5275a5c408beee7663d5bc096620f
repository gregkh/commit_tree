[media] cx25821: Remove useless struct i2c_algo_bit_data

The field 'struct i2c_algo_bit_data i2c_algo' is wrongly confused with
struct i2c_algorithm. Moreover, i2c_algo field is not used since
i2c is registered using i2c_add_adpater() and not i2c_bit_add_bus().
Therefore, it's safe to remove it.
Tested by compilation only.
