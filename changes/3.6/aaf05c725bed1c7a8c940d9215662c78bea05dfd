tools lib traceevent: Fix %pM print format arg handling

When %pM is used, the arg value must be a 6 byte character that will
be printed as a 6 byte MAC address. But the code does a break over the
main code which updates the current processing arg to point to the
next arg. If there are other print arguments after a %pM, they will be
off by one. The next arg will still be processing the %pM arg.
