drm/i915: Don't forget to apply SNB PIPE_CONTROL GTT workaround.

If a buffer that was the target of a PIPE_CONTROL from userland was a
reused one that hadn't been evicted which had not previously had this
workaround applied, then the early return for a correct
presumed_offset in this function meant we would not bind it into the
GTT and the write would land somewhere else.

Fixes reproducible failures with GL_EXT_timer_query usage in apitrace,
and I also expect it to fix the intermittent OQ issues on snb that
danvet's been working on.
