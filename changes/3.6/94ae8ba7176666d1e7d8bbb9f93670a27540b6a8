hugetlb/cgroup: assign the page hugetlb cgroup when we move the page to active list.

A page's hugetlb cgroup assignment and movement to the active list should
occur with hugetlb_lock held.  Otherwise when we remove the hugetlb cgroup
we will iterate the active list and find pages with NULL hugetlb cgroup
values.
