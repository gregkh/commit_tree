USB: isp1362-hcd.c: usb message always saved in case of underrun

The usb message must be saved also in case the USB endpoint is not a
control endpoint (i.e., "endpoint 0"), otherwise in some circumstances
we don't have a payload in case of error.

The patch has been created by tracing with usbmon the different error
messages generated by this driver with respect to the ehci-hcd driver.
