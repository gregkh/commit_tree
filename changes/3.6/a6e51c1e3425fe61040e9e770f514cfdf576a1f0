staging: Delete if_strip.h

Commit f80a3f62383bf673c310926d55142d51f118926d ("Staging: strip: delete
the driver") left if_strip.h unused: nothing in the tree includes it
anymore. It is still exported, but since nothing in the kernel uses
struct MetricomAddress, that seems pointless. Delete this header too.
