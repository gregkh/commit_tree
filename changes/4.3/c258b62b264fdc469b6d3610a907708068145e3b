KVM: MMU: introduce the framework to check zero bits on sptes

We have abstracted the data struct and functions which are used to check
reserved bit on guest page tables, now we extend the logic to check
zero bits on shadow page tables

The zero bits on sptes include not only reserved bits on hardware but also
the bits that SPTEs willnever use.  For example, shadow pages will never
use GB pages unless the guest uses them too.
