ALSA: usb: fix corrupted pointers due to interface setting change

When a transition occurs between alternate settings that do not use the
same synchronization method, the substream pointers were not reset.
This prevents audio from being played during the second transition.

Identified and tested with M-Audio Transit device
(0763:2006 Midiman M-Audio Transit)

Details of the issue:

First playback to adaptive endpoint:
$ aplay -Dhw:1,0 ~/24_96.wav

Rate 96000 Hz, Stereo

first playback to asynchronous endpoint:

This last line shows that a sync endpoint is used when it shouldn't.
The sync endpoint is no longer valid and the pointers are corrupted
