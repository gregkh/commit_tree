kvm: x86: Fix error handling in the function kvm_lapic_sync_from_vapic

This fixes error handling in the function kvm_lapic_sync_from_vapic
by checking if the call to kvm_read_guest_cached has returned a
error code to signal to its caller the call to this function has
failed and due to this we must immediately return to the caller
of kvm_lapic_sync_from_vapic to avoid incorrectly call apic_set_tpc
if a error has occurred here.
