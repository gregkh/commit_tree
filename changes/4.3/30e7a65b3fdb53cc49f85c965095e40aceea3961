PM / Domains: Ensure subdomain is not in use before removing

The function pm_genpd_remove_subdomain() removes a subdomain from a
generic PM domain, however, it does not check if the subdomain has any
slave domains or device attached before doing so. Therefore, add a test
to verify that the subdomain does not have any slave domains associated
or any device attached before removing.
