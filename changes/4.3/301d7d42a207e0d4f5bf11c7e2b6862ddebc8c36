6lowpan: add request for ipv6 module

The iphc module depends on CONFIG_IPV6, because it's not very useful to
build the module without IPv6 support. Recently an user reported about
issues for setting an IPv6 address to a 6LoWPAN interface. The issues
was solved by modprobe the ipv6 module before. To avoid such user issues
we try to request the ipv6 module when the 6LoWPAN module is loaded.
