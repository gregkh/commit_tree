eeprom: at24: use i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data_or_emulated

For i2c busses that support only SMBUS extensions, the eeprom at24
driver reads data from the device using the SMBus block, word or byte
read protocols depending on availability.

Replace the block read emulation from the driver with the
i2c_smbus_read_i2c_block_data_or_emulated call from i2c core.
