batman-adv: Fix potentially broken skb network header access

The two commits noted below added calls to ip_hdr() and ipv6_hdr(). They
need a correctly set skb network header.

Unfortunately we cannot rely on the device drivers to set it for us.
Therefore setting it in the beginning of the according ndo_start_xmit
handler.

Fixes: ab49886e3da7 ("batman-adv: Add IPv4 link-local/IPv6-ll-all-nodes multicast support")
