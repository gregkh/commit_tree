scripts: Make checkpatch.pl warn on expedited RCU grace periods

The synchronize_rcu_expedited() and synchronize_sched_expedited()
expedited-grace-period primitives induce OS jitter, which can degrade
real-time response.  This commit therefore adds a checkpatch.pl warning
on any patch adding them.

Note that this patch does not warn on synchronize_srcu_expedited()
because it does not induce OS jitter, courtesy of its otherwise
much-maligned read-side memory barriers.
