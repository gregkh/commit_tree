rtc: switch to using is_visible() to control sysfs attributes

Instead of creating wakealarm attribute manually, after the device has been
registered, let's rely on facilities provided by the attribute groups to
control which attributes are visible and which are not. This allows to
create all needed attributes at once, at the same time that we register RTC
class device.
