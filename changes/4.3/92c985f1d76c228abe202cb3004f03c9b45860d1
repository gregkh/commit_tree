powerpc: put csum_tcpudp_magic inline

csum_tcpudp_magic() is only a few instructions, and does modify
really few registers. So it is not worth having it as a separate
function and suffer function branching and saving of volatile
registers.

This patch makes it inline by use of the already existing
csum_tcpudp_nofold() function.
