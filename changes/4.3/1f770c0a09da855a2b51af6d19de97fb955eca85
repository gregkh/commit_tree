netlink: Fix autobind race condition that leads to zero port ID

The commit c0bb07df7d981e4091432754e30c9c720e2c0c78 ("netlink:
Reset portid after netlink_insert failure") introduced a race
condition where if two threads try to autobind the same socket
one of them may end up with a zero port ID.  This led to kernel
deadlocks that were observed by multiple people.

This patch reverts that commit and instead fixes it by introducing
a separte rhash_portid variable so that the real portid is only set
after the socket has been successfully hashed.
