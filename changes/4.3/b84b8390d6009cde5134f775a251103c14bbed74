Btrfs: fix file read corruption after extent cloning and fsync

If we partially clone one extent of a file into a lower offset of the
file, fsync the file, power fail and then mount the fs to trigger log
replay, we can get multiple checksum items in the csum tree that overlap
each other and result in checksum lookup failures later. Those failures
can make file data read requests assume a checksum value of 0, but they
will not return an error (-EIO for example) to userspace exactly because
the expected checksum value 0 is a special value that makes the read bio
endio callback return success and set all the bytes of the corresponding
page with the value 0x01 (at fs/btrfs/inode.c:__readpage_endio_check()).
From a userspace perspective this is equivalent to file corruption
because we are not returning what was written to the file.

Details about how this can happen, and why, are included inline in the
following reproducer test case for fstests and the comment added to
tree-log.c.

  # Create our test file with a single 100K extent starting at file
  # offset 800K. We fsync the file here to make the fsync log tree gets
  # a single csum item that covers the whole 100K extent, which causes
  # the second fsync, done after the cloning operation below, to not
  # leave in the log tree two csum items covering two sub-ranges
  # ([0, 20K[ and [20K, 100K[)) of our extent.
  $XFS_IO_PROG -f -c "pwrite -S 0xaa 800K 100K"  \

  # Now clone part of our extent into file offset 400K. This adds a file
  # extent item to our inode's metadata that points to the 100K extent
  # we created before, using a data offset of 20K and a data length of
  # 20K, so that it refers to the sub-range [20K, 40K[ of our original
  # extent.
  $CLONER_PROG -s $((800 * 1024 + 20 * 1024)) -d $((400 * 1024)) \
      -l $((20 * 1024)) $SCRATCH_MNT/foo $SCRATCH_MNT/foo

  # Now fsync our file to make sure the extent cloning is durably
  # persisted. This fsync will not add a second csum item to the log
  # tree containing the checksums for the blocks in the sub-range
  # [20K, 40K[ of our extent, because there was already a csum item in
  # the log tree covering the whole extent, added by the first fsync
  # we did before.
  $XFS_IO_PROG -c "fsync" $SCRATCH_MNT/foo

  echo "File digest before power failure:"

  # Silently drop all writes and ummount to simulate a crash/power
  # failure.
  _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_DROP_WRITES
  _unmount_flakey

  # Allow writes again, mount to trigger log replay and validate file
  # contents.
  # The fsync log replay first processes the file extent item
  # corresponding to the file offset 400K (the one which refers to the
  # [20K, 40K[ sub-range of our 100K extent) and then processes the file
  # extent item for file offset 800K. It used to happen that when
  # processing the later, it erroneously left in the csum tree 2 csum
  # items that overlapped each other, 1 for the sub-range [20K, 40K[ and
  # 1 for the whole range of our extent. This introduced a problem where
  # subsequent lookups for the checksums of blocks within the range
  # [40K, 100K[ of our extent would not find anything because lookups in
  # the csum tree ended up looking only at the smaller csum item, the
  # one covering the subrange [20K, 40K[. This made read requests assume
  # an expected checksum with a value of 0 for those blocks, which caused
  # checksum verification failure when the read operations finished.
  # However those checksum failure did not result in read requests
  # returning an error to user space (like -EIO for e.g.) because the
  # expected checksum value had the special value 0, and in that case
  # btrfs set all bytes of the corresponding pages with the value 0x01
  # and produce the following warning in dmesg/syslog:
  #
  #  "BTRFS warning (device dm-0): csum failed ino 257 off 917504 csum\
  #   1322675045 expected csum 0"
  #

  echo "File digest after log replay:"
  # Must match the same digest he had after cloning the extent and
  # before the power failure happened.
