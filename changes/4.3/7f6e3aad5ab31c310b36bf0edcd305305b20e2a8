crypto: nx - move kzalloc() out of spinlock

Move the kzalloc() calls in nx842_probe() and nx842_OF_upd() to the top
of the functions, before taking the devdata spinlock.

Since kzalloc() without GFP_ATOMIC can sleep, it can't be called while
holding a spinlock.  Move the calls to before taking the lock.
