IB/mlx5: Remove pa_lkey usages

Since mlx5 driver cannot rely on registration using the
reserved lkey (global_dma_lkey) it used to allocate a private
physical address lkey for each allocated pd.
Commit 96249d70dd70 ("IB/core: Guarantee that a local_dma_lkey
is available") just does it in the core layer so we can go ahead
and use that.
