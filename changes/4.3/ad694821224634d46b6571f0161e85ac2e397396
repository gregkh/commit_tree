ocfs2: fix race between crashed dio and rm

There is a race case between crashed dio and rm, which will lead to
OCFS2_VALID_FL not set read-only.

  N1                              N2
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------
  dd with direct flag
                                  rm file
  crashed with an dio entry left
  in orphan dir
                                  clear OCFS2_VALID_FL in
                                  ocfs2_remove_inode
                                  recover N1 and read the corrupted inode,
                                  and set filesystem read-only

So we skip the inode deletion this time and wait for dio entry recovered
first.
