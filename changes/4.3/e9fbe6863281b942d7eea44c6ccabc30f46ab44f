powerpc: Change syscall_get_nr() to return int

The documentation for syscall_get_nr() in asm-generic says:

 Note this returns int even on 64-bit machines. Only 32 bits of
 system call number can be meaningful. If the actual arch value
 is 64 bits, this truncates to 32 bits so 0xffffffff means -1.

However our implementation was never updated to reflect this.

Generally it's not important, but there is once case where it matters.

For seccomp filter with SECCOMP_RET_TRACE, the tracer will set
regs->gpr[0] to -1 to reject the syscall. When the task is a compat
task, this means we end up with 0xffffffff in r0 because ptrace will
zero extend the 32-bit value.

If syscall_get_nr() returns an unsigned long, then a 64-bit kernel will
see a positive value in r0 and will incorrectly allow the syscall
through seccomp.
