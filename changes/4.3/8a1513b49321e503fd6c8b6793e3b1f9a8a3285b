hp-wmi: limit hotkey enable

Do not write initialize magic on systems that do not have
feature query 0xb. Fixes Bug #82451.

Redefine FEATURE_QUERY to align with 0xb and FEATURE2 with 0xd
for code clearity.

Add a new test function, hp_wmi_bios_2008_later() & simplify
hp_wmi_bios_2009_later(), which fixes a bug in cases where
an improper value is returned. Probably also fixes Bug #69131.

Add missing __init tag.
