bpf: s390: Fix build error caused by the struct bpf_array member name changed

There is a build error that "'struct bpf_array' has no member
named 'prog'" on s390. In commit 2a36f0b92eb6 ("bpf: Make the
bpf_prog_array_map more generic"), the member 'prog' of struct
bpf_array is replaced by 'ptrs'. So this patch fixes it.
