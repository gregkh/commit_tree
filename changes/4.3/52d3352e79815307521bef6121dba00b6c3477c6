bpf tools: Create eBPF maps defined in an object file

This patch creates maps based on 'map' section in object file using
bpf_create_map(), and stores the fds into an array in 'struct
bpf_object'.

Previous patches parse ELF object file and collects required data, but
doesn't play with the kernel. They belong to the 'opening' phase. This
patch is the first patch in 'loading' phase. The 'loaded' field is
introduced in 'struct bpf_object' to avoid loading an object twice,
because the loading phase clears resources collected during the opening
which becomes useless after loading. In this patch, maps_buf is cleared.
