s390/cpum_cf: Corrected return code for unauthorized counter sets

Previously, the cpum_cf PMU returned -EPERM if a counter is requested and
the counter set to which the counter belongs is not authorized.  According
to the perf_event_open() system call manual, an error code of EPERM indicates
an unsupported exclude setting or CAP_SYS_ADMIN is missing.

Use ENOENT to indicate that particular counters are not available when the
counter set which contains the counter is not authorized.  For generic events,
this might trigger a fall back, for example, to a software event.
