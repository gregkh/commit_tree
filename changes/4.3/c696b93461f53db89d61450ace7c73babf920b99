arm64/debug: Simplify BRK insn opcode declarations

The way the KGDB_DYN_BRK_INS_BYTEx macros are declared is more
complex than it needs to be.  Also, the macros are only used in one
place, which is arch-specific anyway.

This patch refactors the macros to simplify them, and exposes an
argument so that we can have a single macro instead of 4.

As a side effect, this patch also fixes some anomalous spellings of
"KGDB".

These changes alter the compile types of some integer constants
that are harmless but trigger truncation warnings in gcc when
assigning to 32-bit variables.  This patch adds an explicit cast
for the affected cases.
