userfaultfd: revert "userfaultfd: waitqueue: add nr wake parameter to __wake_up_locked_key"

This reverts commit 51360155eccb907ff8635bd10fc7de876408c2e0 and adapts
fs/userfaultfd.c to use the old version of that function.

It didn't look robust to call __wake_up_common with "nr == 1" when we
absolutely require wakeall semantics, but we've full control of what we
insert in the two waitqueue heads of the blocked userfaults.  No
exclusive waitqueue risks to be inserted into those two waitqueue heads
so we can as well stick to "nr == 1" of the old code and we can rely
purely on the fact no waitqueue inserted in one of the two waitqueue
heads we must enforce as wakeall, has wait->flags WQ_FLAG_EXCLUSIVE set.
