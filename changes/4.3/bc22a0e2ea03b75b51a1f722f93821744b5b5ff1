iptunnel: make rx/tx bytes counters consistent

This was already done a long time ago in
commit 64194c31a0b6 ("inet: Make tunnel RX/TX byte counters more consistent")
but tx path was broken (at least since 3.10).

Before the patch the gre header was included on tx.

After the patch:
$ ping -c1 192.168.0.121 ; ip -s l ls dev gre1
PING 192.168.0.121 (192.168.0.121) 56(84) bytes of data.
