drm/i915: Update ppgtt_init_ring() & context_enable() to take requests

The final step in removing the OLR from i915_gem_init_hw() is to pass the newly
allocated request structure in to each step rather than passing a ring
structure. This patch updates both i915_ppgtt_init_ring() and
i915_gem_context_enable() to take request pointers.
