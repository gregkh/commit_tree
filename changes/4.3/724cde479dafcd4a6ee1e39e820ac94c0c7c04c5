ARM: dts: qcom: Add ks8851 node for wired ethernet

The micrel ks8851 device is present on MSM8960 CDP boards. It is
connected to two regulators, one controlled via a gpio and
another controlled via the RPM. Add the gsbi, spi, gpio
regulator, and micrel ks8851 nodes so that ethernet works
properly.
