cxl: Allocate and release the SPA with the AFU

Previously the SPA was allocated and freed upon entering and leaving
AFU-directed mode. This causes some issues for error recovery - contexts
hold a pointer inside the SPA, and they may persist after the AFU has
been detached.

We would ideally like to allocate the SPA when the AFU is allocated, and
release it until the AFU is released. However, we don't know how big the
SPA needs to be until we read the AFU descriptor.

Therefore, restructure the code:

 - Allocate the SPA only once, on the first attach.

 - Release the SPA only when the entire AFU is being released (not
   detached). Guard the release with a NULL check, so we don't free
   if it was never allocated (e.g. dedicated mode)
