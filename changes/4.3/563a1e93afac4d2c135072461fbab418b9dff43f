KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix preempted vcore stolen time calculation

Whenever a vcore state is VCORE_PREEMPT we need to be counting stolen
time for it.  This currently isn't the case when we have a vcore that
no longer has any runnable threads in it but still has a runner task,
so we do an explicit call to kvmppc_core_start_stolen() in that case.
