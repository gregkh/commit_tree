drm/fb_helper: Create a wrapper for fb_set_suspend

Some drm drivers call fb_set_suspend. Create a drm_fb_helper function
that wraps around these calls.

This is part of an effort to prevent drm drivers from calling fbdev
functions directly, in order to make fbdev emulation a top level drm
option.

v3:
- Fixed kerneldoc errors

v2:
- Added kerneldocs
- Added a check for non-NULL fb_helper before proceeding. This will
  make the helpers work when we have a module param for fbdev emulation
- Follow the drm way of aligning of arguments in func definitions
