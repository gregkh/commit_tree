mm, vmscan: unlock page while waiting on writeback

This is merely a politeness: I've not found that shrink_page_list()
leads to deadlock with the page it holds locked across
wait_on_page_writeback(); but nevertheless, why hold others off by
keeping the page locked there?

And while we're at it: remove the mistaken "not " from the commentary on
this Case 3 (and a distracting blank line from Case 2, if I may).
