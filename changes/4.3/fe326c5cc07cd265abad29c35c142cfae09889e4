clocksource/drivers/sh_mtu2: Fix multiple shutdown call issue

On the r7s72100 Genmai board the MTU2 driver currently triggers a common
clock framework WARN_ON(enable_count) when disabling the clock due to
the MTU2 driver after recent callback rework may call ->set_state_shutdown()
multiple times. A similar issue was spotted for the TMU driver and fixed in:
452b132 clocksource/drivers/sh_tmu: Fix traceback spotted in -next

On r7s72100 Genmai v4.3-rc7 built with shmobile_defconfig spits out the
following during boot:
