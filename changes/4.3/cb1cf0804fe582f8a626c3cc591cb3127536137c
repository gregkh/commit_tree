storvsc: be more picky about scmnd->sc_data_direction

Under the 'default' case in scmnd->sc_data_direction we have 3 options:
- DMA_NONE which we handle correctly.
- DMA_BIDIRECTIONAL which is never supposed to be set by SCSI stack.
- Garbage value.

Do WARN() and return -EINVAL in the last two cases. virtio_scsi does
BUG_ON() here but it looks like an overkill.
