arm64: head.S: initialise mdcr_el2 in el2_setup

When entering the kernel at EL2, we fail to initialise the MDCR_EL2
register which controls debug access and PMU capabilities at EL1.

This patch ensures that the register is initialised so that all traps
are disabled and all the PMU counters are available to the host. When a
guest is scheduled, KVM takes care to configure trapping appropriately.
