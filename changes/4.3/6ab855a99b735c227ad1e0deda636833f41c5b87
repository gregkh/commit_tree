ocfs2: add ip_alloc_sem in direct IO to protect allocation changes

In ocfs2, ip_alloc_sem is used to protect allocation changes on the
node.  In direct IO, we add ip_alloc_sem to protect date consistent
between direct-io and ocfs2_truncate_file race (buffer io use
ip_alloc_sem already).  Although inode->i_mutex lock is used to avoid
concurrency of above situation, i think ip_alloc_sem is still needed
because protect allocation changes is significant.

Other filesystem like ext4 also uses rw_semaphore to protect data
consistent between get_block-vs-truncate race by other means, So
ip_alloc_sem in ocfs2 direct io is needed.
