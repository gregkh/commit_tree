PCI: iproc: Delete unnecessary checks before phy calls

The functions phy_exit() and phy_power_off() test whether their argument is
NULL and then return immediately.  Thus the test around the calls is not
needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.

[bhelgaas: also phy_init() and phy_power_on(), as Ray Jui suggested]
[bhelgaas: also remove tests in iproc_pcie_remove()]
