tcp: do not slow start when cwnd equals ssthresh

In the original design slow start is only used to raise cwnd
when cwnd is stricly below ssthresh. It makes little sense
to slow start when cwnd == ssthresh: especially
when hystart has set ssthresh in the initial ramp, or after
recovery when cwnd resets to ssthresh. Not doing so will
also help reduce the buffer bloat slightly.
