drm/i915: Add explicit request management to i915_gem_init_hw()

Now that a single per ring loop is being done for all the different
intialisation steps in i915_gem_init_hw(), it is possible to add proper request
management as well. The last remaining issue is that the context enable call
eventually ends up within *_render_state_init() and this does its own private
_i915_add_request() call.

This patch adds explicit request creation and submission to the top level loop
and removes the add_request() from deep within the sub-functions.

v2: Updated for removal of batch_obj from add_request call in previous patch.
