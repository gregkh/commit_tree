f2fs: add new ioctl F2FS_IOC_GARBAGE_COLLECT

When background gc is off, the only way to trigger gc is executing
a force gc in some operations who wants to grab space in disk.

The executing condition is limited: to execute force gc, we should
wait for the time when there is almost no more free section for LFS
allocation. This seems not reasonable for our user who wants to
control triggering gc by himself.

This patch introduces F2FS_IOC_GARBAGE_COLLECT interface for
triggering garbage collection by using ioctl. It provides our users
one more option to trigger gc.
