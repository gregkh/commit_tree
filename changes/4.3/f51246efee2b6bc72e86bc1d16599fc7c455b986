MIPS: Get rid of finish_arch_switch().

MIPS was using finish_arch_switch() as a hook to restore and initialize
CPU context for all threads, even newly created kernel and user threads.
This is however entirely solvable within switch_to() so get rid of
finish_arch_switch() which is in the way of scheduler cleanups.
