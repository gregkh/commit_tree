ipv6: fix the incorrect return value of throw route

The error condition -EAGAIN, which is signaled by throw routes, tells
the rules framework to walk on searching for next matches. If the walk
ends and we stop walking the rules with the result of a throw route we
have to translate the error conditions to -ENETUNREACH.
