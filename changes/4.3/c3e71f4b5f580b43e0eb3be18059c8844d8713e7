ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable max77802 regulator

The Exynos5420 based Peach Pit and Exynos5800 based Peach Pi Chromebooks
use the Maxim max77802 Power Management IC (PMIC). This PMIC has besides
other devices, a set of regulators that can be controller over I2C.

Commit f3caa529c6f5 ("ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable max77802 regulator,
rtc and clock drivers") was supposed to enable the config option for the
regulator driver as a module but the final version that landed did not
include this. The commit was modified and the REGULATOR_MAX77802 removed
since it was thought to be useless.

Unfortunately that's not the case for the mentioned reason above so this
patch enables the needed Kconfig option.
