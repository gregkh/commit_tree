serial: core: Remove tty port activate() and shutdown() methods

serial core does not use tty_port_open() or tty_port_close(); serial
core defines and extends it's own tty open() and close() methods
(uart_open() and uart_close(), respectively).

Remove the tty_port activate() and shutdown() initializations, and
the uart_port_activate() function, which is never called.

NB: uart_port_shutdown() is used by uart_close() => uart_shutdown()
call chain (but not via the tty_port methods).
