module: Fix locking in symbol_put_addr()

Poma (on the way to another bug) reported an assertion triggering:

  [<ffffffff81150529>] module_assert_mutex_or_preempt+0x49/0x90
  [<ffffffff81150822>] __module_address+0x32/0x150
  [<ffffffff81150956>] __module_text_address+0x16/0x70
  [<ffffffff81150f19>] symbol_put_addr+0x29/0x40
  [<ffffffffa04b77ad>] dvb_frontend_detach+0x7d/0x90 [dvb_core]

Laura Abbott <labbott@redhat.com> produced a patch which lead us to
inspect symbol_put_addr(). This function has a comment claiming it
doesn't need to disable preemption around the module lookup
because it holds a reference to the module it wants to find, which
therefore cannot go away.

This is wrong (and a false optimization too, preempt_disable() is really
rather cheap, and I doubt any of this is on uber critical paths,
otherwise it would've retained a pointer to the actual module anyway and
avoided the second lookup).

While its true that the module cannot go away while we hold a reference
on it, the data structure we do the lookup in very much _CAN_ change
while we do the lookup. Therefore fix the comment and add the
required preempt_disable().
