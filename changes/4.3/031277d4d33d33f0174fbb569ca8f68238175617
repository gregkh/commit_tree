mmc: core: fix dead loop of mmc_retune

When get a CRC error, start the mmc_retune, it will issue CMD19/CMD21
to do tune, assume there were 10 clock phase need to try, phase 0 to
phase 6 is ok, phase 7 to phase 9 is NG, we try it from 0 to 9, so
the last CMD19/CMD21 will get CRC error, host->need_retune was set and
cause mmc_retune was called, then dead loop of mmc_retune
