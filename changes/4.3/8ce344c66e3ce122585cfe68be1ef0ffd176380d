ACPI / processor: remove leftover __refdata annotations

The processor_handler structure does not reference any __init / __exit
code or data. Therefore the __refdata annotation is not needed. It used
to be prior to commit fe7bf106ebc2 ("acpi: delete __cpuinit usage from
all acpi files") due to the __cpuinit annotation of acpi_processor_add().
But with that commit in place that requirement has gone.

The same is true for the acpi_cpu_notifier notifier block.
acpi_cpu_soft_notify() used to be marked __cpuinit but lost its
annotation in the above mentioned commit as well. Therefore the __refdata
annotation isn't needed there either.

Just drop the unneded __refdata annotations to be able to catch future
section mismatches.
