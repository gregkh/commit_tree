f2fs: avoid unneeded initializing when converting inline dentry

When converting inline dentry, we will zero out target dentry page before
duplicating data of inline dentry into target page, it become overhead
since inline dentry size is not small.

So this patch tries to remove unneeded initializing in the space of target
dentry page.
