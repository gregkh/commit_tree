xen/PMU: Intercept PMU-related MSR and APIC accesses

Provide interfaces for recognizing accesses to PMU-related MSRs and
LVTPC APIC and process these accesses in Xen PMU code.

(The interrupt handler performs XENPMU_flush right away in the beginning
since no PMU emulation is available. It will be added with a later patch).
