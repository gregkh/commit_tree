net/mlx4_en: Add support for hardware accelerated 802.1ad vlan

To enable device support in accelerated 802.1ad vlan, the port
capability "packet has vlan enable" (phv_en) should be set.
Firmware won't work properly, in case phv_en is not set.

The user can enable "phv_en" port capability with the new ethtool
private flag phv-bit. The phv-bit private flag default value is OFF,
users who are interested in 802.1ad hardware acceleration should turn ON
the phv-bit private flag:
$ ethtool --set-priv-flags eth1 phv-bit on

Once the private flag is set, the device is ready for 802.1ad vlan
acceleration.

The user should also change the interface device features and turn on
"tx-vlan-stag-hw-insert" which is off by default:
$ ethtool -K eth1  tx-vlan-stag-hw-insert on

"phv-bit" private flag setting is available only for Physical
Functions(PF), the Virtual Function (VF) will be able to use the feature
by setting "tx-vlan-stag-hw-insert" ethtool device feature only if the
feature was enabled by the Hypervisor.
