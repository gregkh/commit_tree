btrfs: fix use after free iterating extrefs

The code for btrfs inode-resolve has never worked properly for
files with enough hard links to trigger extrefs.  It was trying to
get the leaf out of a path after freeing the path:

	btrfs_release_path(path);
	leaf = path->nodes[0];
	item_size = btrfs_item_size_nr(leaf, slot);

The fix here is to use the extent buffer we cloned just a little higher
up to avoid deadlocks caused by using the leaf in the path.
