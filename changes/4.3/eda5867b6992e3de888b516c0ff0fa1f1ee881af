cpu: Remove bogus __ref annotation of cpu_subsys_online()

In commit 0db0628d9012 ("kernel: delete __cpuinit usage from all core
kernel files") cpu_up() lost its __cpuinit annotation, vanishing the
need for cpu_subsys_online() to have a __ref annotation. Just drop it
to be able to catch real section mismatches in the future.
