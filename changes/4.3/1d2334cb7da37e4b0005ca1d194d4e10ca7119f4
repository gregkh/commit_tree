s390/cio: Implement proper Link Incident Record handling

A hardware problem on a FICON link is reported by the Channel Subsystem
to the operating system via a Link Incident Record (LIR). In response,
the operating system should issue a message that enables hardware
service personnel to identify and repair the failing component.

Current Linux LIR handling is broken because LIR data is incorrectly
interpreted and no log message is generated.

This patch fixes Linux LIR handling by implementing a new log message
for LIRs indicating a degraded or non-operational link. Also LIRs are
no longer used to deactivate channel paths because the available data
does not reliably allow to determine the affected channel path.
