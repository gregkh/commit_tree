ARM: EXYNOS: Fix double of_node_put() when parsing child power domains

On each next iteration of for_each_compatible_node() the reference
counter for current device node is already decreased by the loop
iterator. The manual call to of_node_get() is required only on loop
break which is not happening here.

The double of_node_get() (with enabled CONFIG_OF_DYNAMIC) lead to
decreasing the counter below expected, initial value.
