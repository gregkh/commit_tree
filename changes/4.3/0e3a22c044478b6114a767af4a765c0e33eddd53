mmc: dw_mmc: Fix coding style issues

This patch fixes the following issues reported by checkpatch.pl:
- use -EINVAL instead of -ENOSYS, to fix warning message:
   "ENOSYS means 'invalid syscall nr' and nothing else"
- split lines whose length is greater than 80 characters
- avoid quoted string split across lines
- use min_t instead of min, to fix warning message:
   "min() should probably be min_t(int, cnt, host->part_buf_count)"
- fix missing a blank line after declarations
