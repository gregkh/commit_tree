lib: fix data race in rhashtable_rehash_one

rhashtable_rehash_one() uses complex logic to update entry->next field,
after INIT_RHT_NULLS_HEAD and NULLS_MARKER expansion:

entry->next = 1 | ((base + off) << 1)

This can be compiled along the lines of:

entry->next = base + off
entry->next <<= 1
entry->next |= 1

Which will break concurrent readers.

NULLS value recomputation is not needed here, so just remove
the complex logic.

The data race was found with KernelThreadSanitizer (KTSAN).
