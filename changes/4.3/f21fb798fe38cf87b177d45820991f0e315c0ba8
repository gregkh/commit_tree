selftests/zram: Adding zram tests

zram: Compressed RAM based block devices
----------------------------------------
The zram module creates RAM based block devices named /dev/zram<id>
(<id> = 0, 1, ...). Pages written to these disks are compressed and stored
in memory itself. These disks allow very fast I/O and compression provides
good amounts of memory savings. Some of the usecases include /tmp storage,
use as swap disks, various caches under /var and maybe many more :)

Statistics for individual zram devices are exported through sysfs nodes at
/sys/block/zram<id>/

This patch is to validate the zram functionality. Test interacts with block
device /dev/zram<id> and sysfs nodes /sys/block/zram<id>/

zram.sh: sanity check of CONFIG_ZRAM and to run zram01 and zram02 tests
zram01.sh: creates general purpose ram disks with different filesystems
zram02.sh: creates block device for swap
zram_lib.sh: create library with initialization/cleanup functions
README: ZRAM introduction and Kconfig required.
Makefile: To run zram tests
