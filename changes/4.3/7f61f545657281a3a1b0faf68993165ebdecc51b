libceph: don't access invalid memory in keepalive2 path

This

    struct ceph_timespec ceph_ts;
    ...
    con_out_kvec_add(con, sizeof(ceph_ts), &ceph_ts);

wraps ceph_ts into a kvec and adds it to con->out_kvec array, yet
ceph_ts becomes invalid on return from prepare_write_keepalive().  As
a result, we send out bogus keepalive2 stamps.  Fix this by encoding
into a ceph_timespec member, similar to how acks are read and written.
