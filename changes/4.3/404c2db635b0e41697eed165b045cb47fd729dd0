tools: cpupower: Fix error when running cpupower monitor

get_cpu_topology() tries to get topology info from all cpus by reading
files in the topology sysfs dir. If a cpu is offlined, since it doesn't
have topology dir, this function fails and returns -1. This causes
functions relying on get_cpu_topology() to fail. For example-

$ cpupower monitor
Cannot read number of available processors

Fix this by skipping fetching topology info for offline cpus.
