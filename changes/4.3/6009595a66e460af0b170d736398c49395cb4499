mei: bus: link client devices instead of host clients

MEI bus was designed around nfc and was hard to extend.
Instead of the hard coded way of adding the devices on the mei bus
we scan the whole me client list and create a device for each
eligible me client (mei_cl_bus_rescan); currently we support
only clients with single connection and fixed address clients.
NFC radio name detection is run as a fixup routine

The patch replaces handling the device list based on struct me_cl
to device list based on me_cl_devices. The creating a connection
is pushed from the device creation time to device enablement.
