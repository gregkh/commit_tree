s390/syscalls: ignore syscalls reachable via sys_socketcall

x86 will wire up all syscalls reachable via sys_socketcall. Therefore this
will yield a lot of warnings from the checksyscalls.sh scripts on s390
where we currently don't wire them up directly.

This might change in the future, but this needs to be done carefully in
order to not break anything.

For the time being just tell the checksyscalls script to ignore the missing
syscalls on s390.
