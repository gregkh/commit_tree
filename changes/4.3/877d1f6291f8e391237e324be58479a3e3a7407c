net: Set sk_txhash from a random number

This patch creates sk_set_txhash and eliminates protocol specific
inet_set_txhash and ip6_set_txhash. sk_set_txhash simply sets a
random number instead of performing flow dissection. sk_set_txash
is also allowed to be called multiple times for the same socket,
we'll need this when redoing the hash for negative routing advice.
