h8300: Provide atomic_{or,xor,and}

Implement atomic logic ops -- atomic_{or,xor,and}

These will replace the atomic_{set,clear}_mask functions that are
available on some archs.

Also rework the atomic implementation in terms of CPP macros to avoid
the typical repetition -- I seem to have missed this arch the last
time around when I did that.
