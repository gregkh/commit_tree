serial: 8250_omap: fix kernel crash in suspend-to-ram

omap_device infrastructure has a suspend_noirq hook which
runtime suspends all devices late in the suspend cycle (see
_od_suspend_noirq() in arch/arm/mach-omap2/omap_device.c)

This leads to a NULL pointer exception in 8250_omap driver
since by the time omap8250_runtime_suspend() is called, 8250_dma
driver has already set rxchan to NULL via serial8250_release_dma().

Make an explicit check to see if rxchan is NULL in
runtime_{suspend|resume} hooks to fix this.
