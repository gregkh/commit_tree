Input: psmouse - add small delay for IBM trackpoint pass-through mode

There are trackpoint devices that fail to respond to the PS2 command
PSMOUSE_CMD_GETID if immediately queried after the parent device is
deactivated. Add a small delay for the hardware to get in a sane state
before sending any PS2 commands.

One example of such a system is:
Lenovo ThinkPad X120e, model 30515QG
synaptics: Touchpad model: 1, fw: 8.0, id: 0x1e2b1, caps: 0xd001a3/0x940300/0x121c00, board id: 1811, fw id: 797391
