mm/hugetlb: vma_has_reserves() needs to handle fallocate hole punch

In vma_has_reserves(), the current assumption is that reserves are
always present for shared mappings.  However, this will not be the case
with fallocate hole punch.  When punching a hole, the present page will
be deleted as well as the region/reserve map entry (and hence any
reservation).  vma_has_reserves is passed "chg" which indicates whether
or not a region/reserve map is present.  Use this to determine if
reserves are actually present or were removed via hole punch.
