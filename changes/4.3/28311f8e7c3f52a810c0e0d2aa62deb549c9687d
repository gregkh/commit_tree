bnx2x: Utilize FW 7.12.30

This moves bnx2x into using 7.12.30 FW. Said firmware fixes the following:

 - Packets from a VF with pvid configured which were sent with a
   different vlan were transmitted instead of being discarded.

 - FCoE traffic might not recover after a failue while there's traffic
   to another function.

In addition, this FW opens the door for the driver to implement several
new features; Specifically, this enhances the device's support for
encapsulated packets and will allow vxlan/geneve offloads to be added in
the future, as well as vlan filtering offload.
