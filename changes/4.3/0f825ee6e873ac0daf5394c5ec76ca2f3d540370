f2fs: add new interfaces for extent tree

Add a lookup and a insertion interface for extent tree.
The new lookup return the insert position and the prev/next
extents closest to the offset we lookup when find no match.
The new insertion uses above parameters to improve performance.

There are three possible insertions after the lookup in
f2fs_update_extent_tree, two of them insert parts of removed extent
back to tree, since no merge happens during this process, new insertion
skips the merge check in this scanario; the another insertion inserts a
new extent to tree, new insertion uses prev/next extent and insert
position to insert this extent directly, and save the time of searching
down the tree.

As long as tree remains unchanged between lookup and insertion, this
would work fine. And the new lookup would be useful when add
multi-blocks extent support for insertion interface.
