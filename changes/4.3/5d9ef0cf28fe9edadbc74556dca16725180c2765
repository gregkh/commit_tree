ARM: dts: AM4372: Reorder the rtc compatible string

Compared to da830-rtc compatibility am3352-rtc is more compatible to
the one in am437x. Hence adding the am3352-rtc compatible to cover the
entire feature set.

The ti,am4372-rtc has no Documentation and not used even in the driver
hence removing it.
