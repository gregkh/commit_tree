lwtunnel: remove source and destination UDP port config option

The UDP tunnel config is asymmetric wrt. to the ports used. The source and
destination ports from one direction of the tunnel are not related to the
ports of the other direction. We need to be able to respond to ARP requests
using the correct ports without involving routing.

As the consequence, UDP ports need to be fixed property of the tunnel
interface and cannot be set per route. Remove the ability to set ports per
route. This is still okay to do, as no kernel has been released with these
attributes yet.

Note that the ability to specify source and destination ports is preserved
for other users of the lwtunnel API which don't use routes for tunnel key
specification (like openvswitch).

If in the future we rework ARP handling to allow port specification, the
attributes can be added back.
