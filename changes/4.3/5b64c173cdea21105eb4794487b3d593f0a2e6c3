ASoC: fsl_ssi: Fix checking of dai format for AC97 mode

Current code incorrectly treats dai format for AC97 as bit mask
whereas it's actually an integer value. This causes DAI formats
other than AC97 (e.g. DSP_B) to trigger AC97 related code,
which is incorrect and breaks functionality. This patch fixes
the code to correctly compare values to determine AC97 or not.
