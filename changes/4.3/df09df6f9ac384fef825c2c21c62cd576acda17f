ARM: dts: add exynos5422-cpus.dtsi to correct cpu order

The odroid-xu3 board which is based on exynos5422 not exynos5800
is booted from cortex-a7 core unlike exynos5800. The odroid-xu3's
cpu order is quite strange. cpu0 and cpu5-7 are cortex-a7 cores and
cpu1-4 are cortex-a15 cores. To correct this mis-odering, I added
exynos5422-cpus.dtsi and reversing cpu orders from exynos5420.
Now, cpu0-3 are cortex-a7 and cpu4-7 are cortex-a15.
