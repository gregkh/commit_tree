mpt3sas: Provides the physical location of sas drives

This Patch will provide more details of the devices such as slot number,
enclosure logical id, enclosure level & connector name in the following
scenarios,

- When end device is added in the topology,

- When the end device is removed from the setup,

- When the SCSI mid layer issues TASK ABORT/ DEVICE RESET/ TARGET RESET during
  error handling,

- When any command to the device fails with Sense key Hardware error or Medium
  error or Unit Attention,

- When firmware returns device error or device not ready status for the end
  device,

- When a Predicted fault is detected on an end device.

This information can be used by the user to identify the location of the
desired drive in the topology.

Driver will get these information by reading the sas device page0.
