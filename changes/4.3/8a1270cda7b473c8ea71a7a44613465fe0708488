writeback: remove wb_writeback_work->single_wait/done

wb_writeback_work->single_wait/done are used for the wait mechanism
for synchronous wb_work (wb_writeback_work) items which are issued
when bdi_split_work_to_wbs() fails to allocate memory for asynchronous
wb_work items; however, there's no reason to use a separate wait
mechanism for this.  bdi_split_work_to_wbs() can simply use on-stack
fallback wb_work item and separate wb_completion to wait for it.

This patch removes wb_work->single_wait/done and the related code and
make bdi_split_work_to_wbs() use on-stack fallback wb_work and
wb_completion instead.
