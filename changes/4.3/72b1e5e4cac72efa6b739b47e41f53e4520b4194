netfilter: bridge: reduce nf_bridge_info to 32 bytes again

We can use union for most of the temporary cruft (original ipv4/ipv6
address, source mac, physoutdev) since they're used during different
stages of br netfilter traversal.

Also get rid of the last two ->mask users.

Shrinks struct from 48 to 32 on 64bit arch.
