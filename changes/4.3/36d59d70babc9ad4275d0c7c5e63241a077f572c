staging: comedi: me4000: comedi_handle_events() will stop conversions

The irq handler does not need to manually stop conversions and disable
interrupts when "end-of-acquisition", "error", or "overflow" events are
detected. The comedi_handle_events() will call the subdevice (*cancel)
when these are detected and stop the acquisition.
