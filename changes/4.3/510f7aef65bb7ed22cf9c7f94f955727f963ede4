Drivers: hv: vmbus: prefer 'die' notification chain to 'panic'

current_pt_regs() sometimes returns regs of the userspace process and in
case of a kernel crash this is not what we need to report. E.g. when we
trigger crash with sysrq we see the following:
...
 RIP: 0010:[<ffffffff815b8696>]  [<ffffffff815b8696>] sysrq_handle_crash+0x16/0x20
 RSP: 0018:ffff8800db0a7d88  EFLAGS: 00010246
 RAX: 000000000000000f RBX: ffffffff820a0660 RCX: 0000000000000000
...
at the same time current_pt_regs() give us:
ip=7f899ea7e9e0, ax=ffffffffffffffda, bx=26c81a0, cx=7f899ea7e9e0, ...
These registers come from the userspace process triggered the crash. As we
don't even know which process it was this information is rather useless.

When kernel crash happens through 'die' proper regs are being passed to
all receivers on the die_chain (and panic_notifier_list is being notified
with the string passed to panic() only). If panic() is called manually
(e.g. on BUG()) we won't get 'die' notification so keep the 'panic'
notification reporter as well but guard against double reporting.
