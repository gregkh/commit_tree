blkcg: make blkcg_[rw]stat per-cpu

blkcg_[rw]stat are used as stat counters for blkcg policies.  It isn't
per-cpu by itself and blk-throttle makes it per-cpu by wrapping around
it.  This patch makes blkcg_[rw]stat per-cpu and drop the ad-hoc
per-cpu wrapping in blk-throttle.

* blkg_[rw]stat->cnt is replaced with cpu_cnt which is struct
  percpu_counter.  This makes syncp unnecessary as remote accesses are
  handled by percpu_counter itself.

* blkg_[rw]stat_init() can now fail due to percpu allocation failure
  and thus are updated to return int.

* percpu_counters need explicit freeing.  blkg_[rw]stat_exit() added.

* As blkg_rwstat->cpu_cnt[] can't be read directly anymore, reading
  and summing results are stored in ->aux_cnt[] instead.

* Custom per-cpu stat implementation in blk-throttle is removed.

This makes all blkcg stat counters per-cpu without complicating policy
implmentations.
