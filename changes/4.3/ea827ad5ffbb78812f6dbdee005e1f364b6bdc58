ARM: DRA7: Provide proper IO map table

DRA7 uses OMAP5 IO table at the moment. This is purely spurious since
the OMAP5 and DRA7 register maps are different in many aspects.

AM57xx/DRA7 TRM Reference: http://www.ti.com/lit/ug/spruhz6/spruhz6.pdf

NOTE: Most of the drivers are already doing ioremap, so, there should'nt
be any functional improvement involved here, other than making the
initial iotable more accurate.
