cgroup: define controller file conventions

Traditionally, each cgroup controller implemented whatever interface
it wanted leading to interfaces which are widely inconsistent.
Examining the requirements of the controllers readily yield that there
are only a few control schemes shared among all.

Two major controllers already had to implement new interface for the
unified hierarchy due to significant structural changes.  Let's take
the chance to establish common conventions throughout all controllers.

This patch defines CGROUP_WEIGHT_MIN/DFL/MAX to be used on all weight
based control knobs and documents the conventions that controllers
should follow on the unified hierarchy.  Except for io.weight knob,
all existing unified hierarchy knobs are already compliant.  A
follow-up patch will update io.weight.

v2: Added descriptions of min, low and high knobs.
