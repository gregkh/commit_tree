batman-adv: Avoid u32 overflow during gateway select

The gateway selection based on fast connections is using a single value
calculated from the average tq (0-255) and the download bandwidth (in
100Kibit). The formula for the first step (tq ** 2 * 10000 * bandwidth)
tends to overflow a u32 with low bandwidth settings like 50 [100KiBit]
and a tq value of over 92.

Changing this to a 64 bit unsigned integer allows to support a
bandwidth_down with up to ~2.8e10 [100KiBit] and a perfect tq of 255. This
is ~6.6 times higher than the maximum possible value of the gateway
announcement TVLV.

This problem only affects the non-default gw_sel_class 1.
