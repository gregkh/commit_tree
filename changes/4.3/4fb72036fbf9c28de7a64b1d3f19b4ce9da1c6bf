blk-throttle: remove asynchrnous percpu stats allocation mechanism

Because percpu allocator couldn't do non-blocking allocations,
blk-throttle was forced to implement an ad-hoc asynchronous allocation
mechanism for its percpu stats for cases where blkg's (blkcg_gq's) are
allocated from an IO path without sleepable context.

Now that percpu allocator can handle gfp_mask and blkg_policy_data
alloc / free are handled by policy methods, the ad-hoc asynchronous
allocation mechanism can be replaced with direct allocation from
tg_stats_alloc_fn().  Rit it out.

This ensures that an active throtl_grp always has valid non-NULL
->stats_cpu.  Remove checks on it.
