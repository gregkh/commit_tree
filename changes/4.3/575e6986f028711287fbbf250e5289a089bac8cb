cxl: Clean up adapter MMIO unmap path.

- MMIO pointer unmapping is guarded by a null pointer check.
   However, iounmap doesn't null the pointer, just invalidate it.
   Therefore, explicitly null the pointer after unmapping.

 - afu_desc_mmio also needs to be unmapped.

 - PCI regions are allocated in cxl_map_adapter_regs.
   Therefore they should be released in unmap, not elsewhere.
