cpufreq: governor: Don't WARN on invalid states

With previous commit, governors have started to return errors on invalid
state-transition requests. We already have a WARN for an invalid
state-transition request in cpufreq_governor_dbs(). This does trigger
today, as the sequence of events isn't guaranteed by cpufreq core.

Lets stop warning on that for now, and make sure we don't enter an
invalid state.
