fbdev: fix cea_modes array size

CEA defines 64 modes, indexed from 1 to 64. modedb has cea_modes arrays,
which contains 64 entries. However, the code uses the CEA indices
directly, i.e. the first mode is at cea_modes[1]. This means the array
is one too short.

This does not cause references to uninitialized memory as the code in
fbmon only allows indexes up to 63, and the cea_modes does not contain
an entry for the mode 64 so it could not be used in any case.

However, the code contains a check 'if (idx > ARRAY_SIZE(cea_modes)',
and while that check is a no-op as at that point idx cannot be >= 63, it
upsets static checkers.

Fix this by increasing the cea_array size to be 65, and change the code
to allow mode 64.
