checkpatch: add constant comparison on left side test

"CONST <comparison> variable" checks like:

        if (NULL != foo)
and
        while (0 < bar(...))

where a constant (or what appears to be a constant like an upper case
identifier) is on the left of a comparison are generally preferred to be
written using the constant on the right side like:

        if (foo != NULL)
and
        while (bar(...) > 0)

Add a test for this.

Add a --fix option too, but only do it when the code is immediately
surrounded by parentheses to avoid misfixing things like "(0 < bar() +
constant)"
