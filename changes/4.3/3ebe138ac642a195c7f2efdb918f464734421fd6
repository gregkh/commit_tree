rbd: fix double free on rbd_dev->header_name

If rbd_dev_image_probe() in rbd_dev_probe_parent() fails, header_name
is freed twice: once in rbd_dev_probe_parent() and then in its caller
rbd_dev_image_probe() (rbd_dev_image_probe() is called recursively to
handle parent images).

rbd_dev_probe_parent() is responsible for probing the parent, so it
shouldn't muck with clone's fields.
