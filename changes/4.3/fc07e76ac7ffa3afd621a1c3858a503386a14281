Revert "KVM: SVM: use NPT page attributes"

This reverts commit 3c2e7f7de3240216042b61073803b61b9b3cfb22.
Initializing the mapping from MTRR to PAT values was reported to
fail nondeterministically, and it also caused extremely slow boot
(due to caching getting disabled---bug 103321) with assigned devices.
