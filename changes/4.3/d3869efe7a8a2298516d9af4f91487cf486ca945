Fix AF_PACKET ABI breakage in 4.2

Commit 7d82410950aa ("virtio: add explicit big-endian support to memory
accessors") accidentally changed the virtio_net header used by
AF_PACKET with PACKET_VNET_HDR from host-endian to big-endian.

Since virtio_legacy_is_little_endian() is a very long identifier,
define a vio_le macro and use that throughout the code instead of the
hard-coded 'false' for little-endian.

This restores the ABI to match 4.1 and earlier kernels, and makes my
test program work again.
