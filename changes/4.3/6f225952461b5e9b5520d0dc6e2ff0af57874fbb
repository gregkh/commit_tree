openvswitch: Reject ct_state unsupported bits

Previously, if userspace specified ct_state bits in the flow key which
are currently undefined (and therefore unsupported), then they would be
ignored. This could cause unexpected behaviour in future if userspace is
extended to support additional bits but attempts to communicate with the
current version of the kernel. This patch rectifies the situation by
rejecting such ct_state bits.
