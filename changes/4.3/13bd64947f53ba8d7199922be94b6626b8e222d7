rcu: Reset rcu_fanout_leaf if out of bounds

Currently if the rcu_fanout_leaf boot parameter is out of bounds (that
is, less than RCU_FANOUT_LEAF or greater than the number of bits in an
unsigned long), a warning is issued and execution continues with the
out-of-bounds value.  This can result in all manner of failures, so this
patch resets rcu_fanout_leaf to RCU_FANOUT_LEAF when an out-of-bounds
condition is detected.
