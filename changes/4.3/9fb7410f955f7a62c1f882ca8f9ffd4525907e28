arm64/BUG: Use BRK instruction for generic BUG traps

Currently, the minimal default BUG() implementation from asm-
generic is used for arm64.

This patch uses the BRK software breakpoint instruction to generate
a trap instead, similarly to most other arches, with the generic
BUG code generating the dmesg boilerplate.

This allows bug metadata to be moved to a separate table and
reduces the amount of inline code at BUG and WARN sites.  This also
avoids clobbering any registers before they can be dumped.

To mitigate the size of the bug table further, this patch makes
use of the existing infrastructure for encoding addresses within
the bug table as 32-bit offsets instead of absolute pointers.
(Note that this limits the kernel size to 2GB.)

Traps are registered at arch_initcall time for aarch64, but BUG
has minimal real dependencies and it is desirable to be able to
generate bug splats as early as possible.  This patch redirects
all debug exceptions caused by BRK directly to bug_handler() until
the full debug exception support has been initialised.
