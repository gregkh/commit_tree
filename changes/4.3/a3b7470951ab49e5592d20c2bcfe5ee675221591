ARM: OMAP2+: board-generic: Remove stale of_irq macros

When commit c4082d499fa2 ("ARM: omap2+: board-generic: clean up the
irq data from board file") cleaned up the direct usage of gic_of_init
and omap_intc_of_init, it failed to clean up the macros properly.

Since these macros are no longer used, lets just remove them.
