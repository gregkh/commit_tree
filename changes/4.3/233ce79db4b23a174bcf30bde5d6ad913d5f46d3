ASN.1: Handle 'ANY OPTIONAL' in grammar

An ANY object in an ASN.1 grammar that is marked OPTIONAL should be skipped
if there is no more data to be had.

This can be tested by editing X.509 certificates or PKCS#7 messages to
remove the NULL from subobjects that look like the following:

	SEQUENCE {
	  OBJECT(2a864886f70d01010b);
	  NULL();
	}

This is an algorithm identifier plus an optional parameter.

The modified DER can be passed to one of:

	keyctl padd asymmetric "" @s </tmp/modified.x509
	keyctl padd pkcs7_test foo @s </tmp/modified.pkcs7

It should work okay with the patch and produce EBADMSG without.
