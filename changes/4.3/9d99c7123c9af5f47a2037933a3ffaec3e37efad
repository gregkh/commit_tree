swiotlb: Enable it under x86 PAE

Most distributions end up enabling SWIOTLB already with 32-bit
kernels due to the combination of CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST|CONFIG_XEN=y
as those end up requiring the SWIOTLB.

However for those that are not interested in virtualization and
run in 32-bit they will discover that: "32-bit PAE 4.2.0 kernel
(no IOMMU code) would hang when writing to my USB disk. The kernel
spews million(-ish messages per sec) to syslog, effectively
"hanging" userspace with my kernel.

Oct  2 14:33:06 voodoochild kernel: [  223.287447] nommu_map_sg:
overflow 25dcac000+1024 of device mask ffffffff
Oct  2 14:33:06 voodoochild kernel: [  223.287448] nommu_map_sg:
overflow 25dcac000+1024 of device mask ffffffff
Oct  2 14:33:06 voodoochild kernel: [  223.287449] nommu_map_sg:
overflow 25dcac000+1024 of device mask ffffffff
... etc ..."

Enabling it makes the problem go away.

N.B. With a6dfa128ce5c414ab46b1d690f7a1b8decb8526d
"config: Enable NEED_DMA_MAP_STATE by default when SWIOTLB is selected"
we also have the important part of the SG macros enabled to make this
work properly - in case anybody wants to backport this patch.
