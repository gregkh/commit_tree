net: Use passed in table for nexthop lookups

If a user passes in a table for new routes use that table for nexthop
lookups. Specifically, this solves the case where a connected route does
not exist in the main table, but only another table and then a subsequent
route is added with a next hop using the connected route. ie.,

$ ip route ls
default via 10.0.2.2 dev eth0
10.0.2.0/24 dev eth0  proto kernel  scope link  src 10.0.2.15
169.254.0.0/16 dev eth0  scope link  metric 1003
192.168.56.0/24 dev eth1  proto kernel  scope link  src 192.168.56.51

$ ip route ls table 10
1.1.1.0/24 dev eth2  scope link

Without this patch adding a nexthop route fails:

$ ip route add table 10 2.2.2.0/24 via 1.1.1.10
RTNETLINK answers: Network is unreachable

With this patch the route is added successfully.
