staging: lustre: Deletion of unnecessary checks before three function calls

The following functions test whether their argument is NULL and then
return immediately.
* kfree
* ll_file_data_put
* ptlrpc_connection_put

Thus the test around such calls is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
