coresight: replicator: Use builtin_platform_driver()

Macro builtin_platform_driver can be used for builtin drivers
that don't do anything in driver init. This file depends on
Kconfig CONFIG_CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS which eventually
depends on CORESIGHT. Both CONFIG_CORESIGHT_LINKS_AND_SINKS and
CORESIGHT are bool. So, use builtin_platform_driver and remove
some boilerplate code.

Also, remove header file init.h as functionality like module_init
and module_exit is now relocated to module.h.
