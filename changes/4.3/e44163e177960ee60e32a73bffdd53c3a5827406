btrfs: explictly delete unused block groups in close_ctree and ro-remount

The cleaner thread may already be sleeping by the time we enter
close_ctree.  If that's the case, we'll skip removing any unused
block groups queued for removal, even during a normal umount.
They'll be cleaned up automatically at next mount, but users
expect a umount to be a clean synchronization point, especially
when used on thin-provisioned storage with -odiscard.  We also
explicitly remove unused block groups in the ro-remount path
for the same reason.
