serial: 8250: Defer interrupt enable until fifos enabled

An already-active sender can swamp the interrupt handler with
"too much work" if the rx interrupts are enabled when the fifo is
disabled and operating in single-byte mode.

Defer rx and line status interrupt enable until after the fifos
are enabled in set_termios(), but at least initialize the shadow
IER value with the interrupts which will be enabled.
