iwlwifi: mvm: Add FW paging mechanism for the UMAC on PCI

Family 8000 products has 2 embedded processors, the first
known as LMAC (lower MAC) and implements the functionality from
previous products, the second one is known as UMAC (upper MAC)
and is used mainly for driver offloads as well as new features.
The UMAC is typically “less” real-time than the LMAC and is used
for higher level controls.
The UMAC's code/data size is estimated to be in the mega-byte arena,
taking into account the code it needs to replace in the driver and
the set of new features.

In order to allow the UMAC to execute code that is bigger than its code
memory, we allow the UMAC embedded processor to page out code pages on
DRAM.

When the device is master on the bus(PCI) the driver saves the UMAC's
image pages in blocks of 32K in the DRAM and sends the layout of the
pages to the FW. The FW can load / unload the pages on its own.

The driver can support up to 1 MB of pages.

Add paging mechanism for the UMAC on PCI in order to allow the program
to use a larger virtual space while using less physical memory on the
device.
