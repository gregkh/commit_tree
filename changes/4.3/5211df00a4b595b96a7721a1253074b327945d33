drivers: psci: support native SMC{32,64} calls

A 32-bit OS cannot make calls with SMC64 IDs, while a 64-bit OS must
invoke some PSCI functions with SMC64 IDs.

This patch introduces and makes use of a new macro to choose the
appropriate IDs based on the register width of the OS, which will allow
32-bit callers to use the PSCI client code.
