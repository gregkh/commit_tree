virtio-net: avoid unnecessary sg initialzation

Usually an skb does not have up to MAX_SKB_FRAGS frags. So no need to
initialize the unuse part of sg. This patch initialize the sg based on
the real number it will used:

- during xmit, it could be inferred from nr_frags and can_push.
- for small receive buffer, it will also be 2.
