drm/i915: Changes required to enable DSI Video Mode on CHT

On CHT, changes are required for calculating the correct m,n & p with
minimal error +/- for the required DSI clock, so that the correct
dividor & ctrl values are written in cck regs for DSI. This patch has
been tested on CHT RVP with 1200 x 1920 panel.

v2 by Jani, rebased on earlier refactoring, original at [1].
