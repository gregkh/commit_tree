ARM: shmobile: timer: r8a73a4 and r8a7790 are multi-platform only

Since commits e042681894b62d60 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Remove legacy
code") and 9d07d414d4c33d86 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a73a4: ape6evm: Remove
legacy platform"), the R-Mobile APE6 and R-Car H2 SoCs are supported by
multiplatform kernels only.
Hence we can drop checks for these SoCs in legacy kernel builds.
