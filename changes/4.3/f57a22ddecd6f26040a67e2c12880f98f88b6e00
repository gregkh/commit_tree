ocfs2: avoid access invalid address when read o2dlm debug messages

The following case will lead to a lockres is freed but is still in use.

cat /sys/kernel/debug/o2dlm/locking_state	dlm_thread
lockres_seq_start
    -> lock dlm->track_lock
    -> get resA
                                                resA->refs decrease to 0,
                                                call dlm_lockres_release,
                                                and wait for "cat" unlock.
Although resA->refs is already set to 0,
increase resA->refs, and then unlock
                                                lock dlm->track_lock
                                                    -> list_del_init()
                                                    -> unlock
                                                    -> free resA

In such a race case, invalid address access may occurs.  So we should
delete list res->tracking before resA->refs decrease to 0.
