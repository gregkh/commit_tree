mac80211: TDLS: correctly configure SMPS state

The IEEE802.11-2012 specification is vague regarding SMPS operation during
TDLS. It does not define a clear way to transition between SMPS states.

To avoid interop issues, set SMPS to off when TDLS peers are connected.
Accomplish this by extending the definition of the AUTOMATIC state. If the
driver forces a state other than OFF, disconnect all TDLS peers.

While at it, avoid changing the SMPS state of the peer STA. We have no
way to control it, so try and behave correctly towards it.

Move the TDLS peer-teardown function to where the rest of the TDLS code
resides.
