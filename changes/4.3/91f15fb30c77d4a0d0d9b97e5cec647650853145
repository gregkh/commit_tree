PCI: Disable async suspend/resume for JMicron multi-function SATA/AHCI

On multi-function JMicron SATA/PATA/AHCI devices, the PATA controller at
function 1 doesn't work if it is powered on before the SATA controller at
function 0.  The result is that PATA doesn't work after resume, and we
print messages like this:

  pata_jmicron 0000:02:00.1: Refused to change power state, currently in D3
  irq 17: nobody cared (try booting with the "irqpoll" option)

Async resume was introduced in v3.15 by 76569faa62c4 ("PM / sleep:
Asynchronous threads for resume_noirq").  Prior to that, we powered on
the functions in order, so this problem shouldn't happen.

e6b7e41cdd8c ("ata: Disabling the async PM for JMicron chip 363/361")
solved the problem for JMicron 361 and 363 devices.  With async suspend
disabled, we always power on function 0 before function 1.

Barto then reported the same problem with a JMicron 368 (see comment #57 in
the bugzilla).

Rather than extending the blacklist piecemeal, disable async suspend for
all JMicron multi-function SATA/PATA/AHCI devices.

This quirk could stay in the ahci and pata_jmicron drivers, but it's likely
the problem will occur even if pata_jmicron isn't loaded until after the
suspend/resume.  Making it a PCI quirk ensures that we'll preserve the
power-on order even if the drivers aren't loaded.
