arm/arm64: KVM: Fix ordering of timer/GIC on guest entry

As we now inject the timer interrupt when we're about to enter
the guest, it makes a lot more sense to make sure this happens
before the vgic code queues the pending interrupts.

Otherwise, we get the interrupt on the following exit, which is
not great for latency (and leads to all kind of bizarre issues
when using with active interrupts at the HW level).
