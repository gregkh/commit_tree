ASoC: ad1980: Use core AC'97 reset helper

Use the new snd_ac97_reset() helper function to perform the reset and
verify the device ID.

Unfortunately the reset can't be done in snd_soc_new_ac97_codec() due to
the special requirements in order to support the non-standard 16-bit slot
mode of the ad1980.
