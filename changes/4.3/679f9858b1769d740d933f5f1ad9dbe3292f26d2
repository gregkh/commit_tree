rcu: Cleanup rcu_init_geometry() code and arithmetics

This update simplifies rcu_init_geometry() code flow
and makes calculation of the total number of rcu_node
structures more easy to read.

The update relies on the fact num_rcu_lvl[] is never
accessed beyond rcu_num_lvls index by the rest of the
code. Therefore, there is no need initialize the whole
num_rcu_lvl[].
