netfilter: bridge: fix IPv6 packets not being bridged with CONFIG_IPV6=n

230ac490f7fba introduced a dependency to CONFIG_IPV6 which breaks bridging
of IPv6 packets on a bridge with CONFIG_IPV6=n.

Sysctl entry /proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-ip6tables defaults to 1,
for this reason packets are handled by br_nf_pre_routing_ipv6(). When compiled
with CONFIG_IPV6=n this function returns NF_DROP but should return NF_ACCEPT
to let packets through.

Change CONFIG_IPV6=n br_nf_pre_routing_ipv6() return value to NF_ACCEPT.

Tested with a simple bridge with two interfaces and IPv6 packets trying
to pass from host on left side to host on right side of the bridge.
