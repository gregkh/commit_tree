btrfs: add missing discards when unpinning extents with -o discard

When we clear the dirty bits in btrfs_delete_unused_bgs for extents
in the empty block group, it results in btrfs_finish_extent_commit being
unable to discard the freed extents.

The block group removal patch added an alternate path to forget extents
other than btrfs_finish_extent_commit.  As a result, any extents that
would be freed when the block group is removed aren't discarded.  In my
test run, with a large copy of mixed sized files followed by removal, it
left nearly 2/3 of extents undiscarded.

To clean up the block groups, we add the removed block group onto a list
that will be discarded after transaction commit.
