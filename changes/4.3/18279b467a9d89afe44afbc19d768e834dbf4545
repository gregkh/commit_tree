pmem: remove layer when calling arch_has_wmb_pmem()

Prior to this change arch_has_wmb_pmem() was only called by
arch_has_pmem_api().  Both arch_has_wmb_pmem() and arch_has_pmem_api()
checked to make sure that CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PMEM_API was enabled.

Instead, remove the old arch_has_wmb_pmem() wrapper to be rid of one
extra layer of indirection and the redundant CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_PMEM_API
check. Rename __arch_has_wmb_pmem() to arch_has_wmb_pmem() since we no
longer have a wrapper, and just have arch_has_pmem_api() call the
architecture specific arch_has_wmb_pmem() directly.
