dmaengine: jz4780: Fix error handling/signedness issues

There are a some signedness bugs such as testing for < 0 on unsigned
return values. Additionally there are some cases where functions which
should return NULL on error actually return a PTR_ERR value which can
result in oopses on error. Fix these issues.
