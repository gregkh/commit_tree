s390/lib: export __delay

__delay is exported by most architectures, and may be used in modules.
Since it is not exported for s390, s390:allmodconfig currently fails
to build with

ERROR: "__delay" [drivers/net/phy/mdio-octeon.ko] undefined!

Fixes: a6d678645210 ("net: mdio-octeon: Modify driver to work on both
	ThunderX and Octeon")
