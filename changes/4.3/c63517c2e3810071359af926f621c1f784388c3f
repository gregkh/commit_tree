KVM: PPC: Book3S: correct width in XER handling

In 64 bit kernels, the Fixed Point Exception Register (XER) is a 64
bit field (e.g. in kvm_regs and kvm_vcpu_arch) and in most places it is
accessed as such.

This patch corrects places where it is accessed as a 32 bit field by a
64 bit kernel.  In some cases this is via a 32 bit load or store
instruction which, depending on endianness, will cause either the
lower or upper 32 bits to be missed.  In another case it is cast as a
u32, causing the upper 32 bits to be cleared.

This patch corrects those places by extending the access methods to
64 bits.
