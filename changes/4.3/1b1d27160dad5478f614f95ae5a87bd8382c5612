drm/i915: Fix i855 get_display_clock_speed

Actually read the HPLLCC register insted of assuming it's 0. Fix the
HPLLCC bit definitions and all the missing ones from the 852GME spec.

852GME, 854 and 855 all seem to match the same HPLLC encoding even
though only some of the values are valid is some of the platforms.

v2: Rebased to the latest
