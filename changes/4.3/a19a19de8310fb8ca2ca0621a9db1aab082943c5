bnx2x: use ktime_get_seconds() for timestamp

commit c48f350ff5e7 "bnx2x: Add MFW dump support" added the
bnx2x_update_mfw_dump() function that reads the current time and stores
it in a 32-bit field that gets passed into a buffer in a fixed format.

This is potentially broken when the epoch overflows in 2038, and
otherwise overflows in 2106. As we're trying to avoid uses of
struct timeval for this reason, I noticed the addition of this
function, and tried to rewrite it in a way that is more explicit
about the overflow and that will keep working once we deprecate
struct timeval.

I assume that it is not possible to change the ABI any more, otherwise
we should try to use a 64-bit field for the seconds right away.
