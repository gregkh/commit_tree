gfs2: Make statistics unsigned, suitable for use with do_div()

None of these statistics can meaningfully be negative, and the
numerator for do_div() must have the type u64.  The generic
implementation of do_div() used on some 32-bit architectures asserts
that, resulting in a compiler error in gfs2_rgrp_congested().
