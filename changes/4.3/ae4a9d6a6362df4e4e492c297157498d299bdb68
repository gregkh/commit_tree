be2net: fix BE3-R FW download compatibility check

In the BE3 FW image, unlike Skyhawk's, the "asic_type_rev" field doesn't
track the asic_rev of chip it is compatible with. When asic_type_rev
is 0 the image is compatible only with pre-BE3-R chips (asic_rev < 0x10).
Fix the current compatibility check to take care of this.
We hit this issue when we try to flash old BE3 images (used prior to the
release of BE3-R) on pre-BE3-R adapters.
