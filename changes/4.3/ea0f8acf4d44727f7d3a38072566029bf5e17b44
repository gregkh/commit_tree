powerpc/pseries: Cleanup on pci_dn_reconfig_notifier()

This applies cleanup on pci_dn_reconfig_notifier(), no functional
changes:

   * Rename variable "pci" to "pdn" to indicate its purpose clearly.
   * The parent node can be released at any time. So it should be
     hold with of_get_parent() before accessing it.
   * The device node doesn't have to have parent node in theory.
     More check on this.
