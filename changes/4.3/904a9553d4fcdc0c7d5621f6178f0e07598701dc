mm/page_alloc.c: refine the calculation of highest possible node id

nr_node_ids records the highest possible node id, which is calculated by
scanning the bitmap node_states[N_POSSIBLE].  Current implementation
scan the bitmap from the beginning, which will scan the whole bitmap.

This patch reverses the order by scanning from the end with
find_last_bit().
