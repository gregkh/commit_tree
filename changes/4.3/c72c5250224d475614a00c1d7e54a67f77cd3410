target: allow underflow/overflow for PR OUT etc. commands

It's not necessarily a fatal error if a command with a data-out phase
has a data length that differs from the transport data length (e.g.
PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT might have a parameter list length in the CDB
that's smaller than the FC_DL field), so allow these commands.  The
Windows compliance test sends them.
