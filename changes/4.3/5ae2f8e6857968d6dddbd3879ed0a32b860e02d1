tipc: interrupt link synchronization when a link goes down

When we introduced the new link failover/synch mechanism
in commit 6e498158a827fd515b514842e9a06bdf0f75ab86
("tipc: move link synch and failover to link aggregation level"),
we missed the case when the non-tunnel link goes down during the link
synchronization period. In this case the tunnel link will remain in
state LINK_SYNCHING, something leading to unpredictable behavior when
the failover procedure is initiated.

In this commit, we ensure that the node and remaining link goes
back to regular communication state (SELF_UP_PEER_UP/LINK_ESTABLISHED)
when one of the parallel links goes down. We also ensure that we don't
re-enter synch mode if subsequent SYNCH packets arrive on the remaining
link.
