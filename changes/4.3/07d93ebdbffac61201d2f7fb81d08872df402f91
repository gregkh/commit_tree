score/time: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate score driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

We weren't doing anything in ONESHOT/SHUTDOWN/RESUME modes and so
callbacks for them aren't implemented.
