PCI: Reduce size of ATS structure elements

The extended capabilities list is linked with 12-bit pointers, and the ATS
Smallest Translation Unit and Invalidate Queue Depth fields are both 5
bits.

Use u16 and u8 to hold the extended capability address and the stu and qdep
values.  No functional change.
