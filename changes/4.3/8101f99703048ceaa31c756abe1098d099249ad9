cpufreq: cpufreq_add_dev: name goto labels based on what they do

These labels are are named in two ways normally:
 - Based on what caused to jump to such labels
 - Based on what we do under such labels

We follow the first naming convention today and that leads to multiple
labels for doing the same work. Fix it by switching to the second way of
naming them.
