dlm: fix race while closing connections

When a connection have issues DLM may need to close it.  Therefore we
should also cancel pending workqueues for such connection at that time,
and not just when dlm is not willing to use this connection anymore.

Also, if we don't clear CF_CONNECT_PENDING flag, the error handling
routines won't be able to re-connect as lowcomms_connect_sock() will
check for it.
