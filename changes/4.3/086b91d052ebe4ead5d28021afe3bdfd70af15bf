scsi_dh: integrate into the core SCSI code

Stop building scsi_dh as a separate module and integrate it fully into the
core SCSI code with explicit callouts at bus scan time.  For now the
callouts are placed at the same point as the old bus notifiers were called,
but in the future we will be able to look at ALUA INQUIRY data earlier on.

Note that this also means that the device handler modules need to be loaded
by the time we scan the bus.  The next patches will add support for
autoloading device handlers at bus scan time to make sure they are always
loaded if they are enabled in the kernel config.
