hv_netvsc: Add close of RNDIS filter into change mtu call

The current change mtu call only stops tx before removing RNDIS filter.
In case ringbufer is not empty, the rndis_filter_device_remove() may
hang on removing the buffers.

This patch adds close of RNDIS filter before removing it, also a
gradual waiting loop until the ring is empty. The change_mtu hang
issue under heavy traffic is solved by this patch.
