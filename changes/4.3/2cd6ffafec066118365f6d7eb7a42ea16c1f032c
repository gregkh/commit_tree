rcu: Extend expedited funnel locking to rcu_data structure

The strictly rcu_node based funnel-locking scheme works well in many
cases, but systems with CONFIG_RCU_FANOUT_LEAF=64 won't necessarily get
all that much concurrency.  This commit therefore extends the funnel
locking into the per-CPU rcu_data structure, providing concurrency equal
to the number of CPUs.
