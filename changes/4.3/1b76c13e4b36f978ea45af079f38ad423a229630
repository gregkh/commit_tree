bpf tools: Introduce 'bpf' library and add bpf feature check

This is the first patch of libbpf. The goal of libbpf is to create a
standard way for accessing eBPF object files. This patch creates
'Makefile' and 'Build' for it, allows 'make' to build libbpf.a and
libbpf.so, 'make install' to put them into proper directories.
Most part of Makefile is borrowed from traceevent.

Before building, it checks the existence of libelf in Makefile, and deny
to build if not found. Instead of throwing an error if libelf not found,
the error raises in a phony target "elfdep". This design is to ensure
'make clean' still workable even if libelf is not found.

Because libbpf requires 'kern_version' field set for 'union bpf_attr'
(bpfdep" is used for that dependency), Kernel BPF API is also checked
by intruducing a new feature check 'bpf' into tools/build/feature,
which checks the existence and version of linux/bpf.h. When building
libbpf, it searches that file from include/uapi/linux in kernel source
tree (controlled by FEATURE_CHECK_CFLAGS-bpf). Since it searches kernel
source tree it reside, installing of newest kernel headers is not
required, except we are trying to port these files to an old kernel.

To avoid checking that file when perf building, the newly introduced
'bpf' feature check doesn't added into FEATURE_TESTS and
FEATURE_DISPLAY by default in tools/build/Makefile.feature, but added
into libbpf's specific.
