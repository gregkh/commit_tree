tile: Provide atomic_{or,xor,and}

Implement atomic logic ops -- atomic_{or,xor,and}.

For tilegx, these are relatively straightforward; the architecture
provides atomic "or" and "and", both 32-bit and 64-bit.  To support
xor we provide a loop using "cmpexch".

For the older 32-bit tilepro architecture, we have to extend
the set of low-level assembly routines to include 32-bit "and",
as well as all three 64-bit routines.  Somewhat confusingly,
some 32-bit versions are already used by the bitops inlines, with
parameter types appropriate for bitops, so we have to do a bit of
casting to match "int" to "unsigned long".
