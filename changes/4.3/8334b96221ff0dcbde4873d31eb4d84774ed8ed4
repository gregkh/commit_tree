mm: /proc/pid/smaps:: show proportional swap share of the mapping

We want to know per-process workingset size for smart memory management
on userland and we use swap(ex, zram) heavily to maximize memory
efficiency so workingset includes swap as well as RSS.

On such system, if there are lots of shared anonymous pages, it's really
hard to figure out exactly how many each process consumes memory(ie, rss
+ wap) if the system has lots of shared anonymous memory(e.g, android).

This patch introduces SwapPss field on /proc/<pid>/smaps so we can get
more exact workingset size per process.

Bongkyu tested it. Result is below.

1. 50M used swap
SwapTotal: 461976 kB
SwapFree: 411192 kB

$ adb shell cat /proc/*/smaps | grep "SwapPss:" | awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}';
48236
$ adb shell cat /proc/*/smaps | grep "Swap:" | awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}';
141184

2. 240M used swap
SwapTotal: 461976 kB
SwapFree: 216808 kB

$ adb shell cat /proc/*/smaps | grep "SwapPss:" | awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}';
230315
$ adb shell cat /proc/*/smaps | grep "Swap:" | awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}';
