drm/nouveau/pm: allow to configure domains instead of simple counters

Configuring counters from the userspace require the kernel to handle some
logic related to performance counters. Basically, it has to find a free
slot to assign a counter, to handle extra counting modes like B4/B6 and it
must return and error when it can't configure a counter.

In my opinion, the kernel should not handle all of that logic but it
should only write the configuration sent by the userspace without
checking anything. In other words, it should overwrite the configuration
even if it's already counting and do not return any errors.

This patch allows the userspace to configure a domain instead of
separate counters. This has the advantage to move all of the logic to
the userspace.
