KVM: x86: use correct page table format to check nested page table reserved bits

Intel CPUID on AMD host or vice versa is a weird case, but it can
happen.  Handle it by checking the host CPU vendor instead of the
guest's in reset_tdp_shadow_zero_bits_mask.  For speed, the
check uses the fact that Intel EPT has an X (executable) bit while
AMD NPT has NX.
