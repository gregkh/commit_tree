IB/ucma: HW Device hot-removal support

Currently, IB/cma remove_one flow blocks until all user descriptor managed by
IB/ucma are released. This prevents hot-removal of IB devices. This patch
allows IB/cma to remove devices regardless of user space activity. Upon getting
the RDMA_CM_EVENT_DEVICE_REMOVAL event we close all the underlying HW resources
for the given ucontext. The ucontext itself is still alive till its explicit
destroying by its creator.

Running applications at that time will have some zombie device, further
operations may fail.
