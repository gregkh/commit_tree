GFS2: Move glock superblock pointer to field gl_name

What uniquely identifies a glock in the glock hash table is not
gl_name, but gl_name and its superblock pointer. This patch makes
the gl_name field correspond to a unique glock identifier. That will
allow us to simplify hashing with a future patch, since the hash
algorithm can then take the gl_name and hash its components in one
operation.
