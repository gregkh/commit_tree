blkcg: make blkcg_activate_policy() allow NULL ->pd_init_fn

blkg_create() allows NULL ->pd_init_fn() but blkcg_activate_policy()
doesn't.  As both in-kernel policies implement ->pd_init_fn, it
currently doesn't break anything.  Update blkcg_activate_policy() so
that its behavior is consistent with blkg_create().
