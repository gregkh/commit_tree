drm/i915/bxt: eDP Panel Power sequencing

Changes for BXT - added a IS_BROXTON check to use the macro related to PPS
registers for BXT.
BXT does not have PP_DIV register. Making changes to handle this.
Second set of PPS registers have been defined but will be used when VBT
provides a selection between the 2 sets of registers.

v2:
[Jani] Added 2nd set of PPS registers and the macro
