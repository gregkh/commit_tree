arm64: KVM: Remove all traces of the ThumbEE registers

Although the ThumbEE registers and traps were present in earlier
versions of the v8 architecture, it was retrospectively removed and so
we can do the same.

Whilst this breaks migrating a guest started on a previous version of
the kernel, it is much better to kill these (non existent) registers
as soon as possible.
