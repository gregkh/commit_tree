net: netcp: Fixes hw statistics module base setting error

This patch fixes error in the setting of the hw statistics
module base for K2HK platform.  In K2HK although there are
4 hw statistics modules, but only 2 are visible at a time.
Thus when setting up the pointers to the base of the
corresponding hw statistics modules, modules 0 and 2 should
point to one base, while modules 1 and 3 should point to the
other.
