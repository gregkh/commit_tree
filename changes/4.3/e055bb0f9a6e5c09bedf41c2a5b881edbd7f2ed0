thermal: power_allocator: relax the requirement of a sustainable_power in tzp

The power allocator governor currently requires that a sustainable power
is passed as part of the thermal zone's thermal zone parameters.  If
that parameter is not provided, it doesn't register with the thermal
zone.

While this parameter is strongly recommended for optimal performance, it
doesn't need to be mandatory.  Relax the requirement and allow the
governor to bind to thermal zones that don't provide it by estimating it
from the cooling devices' power model.
