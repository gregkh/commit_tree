dm cache: fix use after freeing migrations

Both free_io_migration() and issue_discard() dereference a migration
that was just freed.  Fix those by saving off the migrations's cache
object before freeing the migration.  Also cleanup needless mg->cache
dereferences now that the cache object is available directly.

Fixes: e44b6a5a3c ("dm cache: move wake_waker() from free_migrations() to where it is needed")
