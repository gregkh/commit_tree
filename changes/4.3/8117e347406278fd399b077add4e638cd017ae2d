tty: serial: men_z135_uart.c: Fix race between IRQ and set_termios()

Fix panic caused by a race between men_z135_intr() and men_z135_set_termios().

men_z135_intr() and men_z135_set_termios() both hold the struct uart_port::lock
spinlock, but men_z135_intr() does a spin_lock_irqsave() and
men_z135_set_termios() does a normal spin_lock(), which can lead to a deadlock
when an interrupt is called while the lock is being helt by
men_z135_set_termios().

This was discovered using a insmod, hardware looppback send/receive, rmmod
stress test.
