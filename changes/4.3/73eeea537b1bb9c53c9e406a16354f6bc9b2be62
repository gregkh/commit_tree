drm/i915/gtt: Introduce fill_page_dma()

When we setup page directories and tables, we point the entries
to a to the next level scratch structure. Make this generic
by introducing a fill_page_dma which maps and flushes. We also
need 32 bit variant for legacy gens.

v2: Fix flushes and handle valleyview (Ville)
v3: Now really fix flushes (Michel, Ville)
