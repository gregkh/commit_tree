nvme: fix 32-bit build warning

Compiling the nvme driver on 32-bit warns about a cast from a __u64
variable to a pointer:

drivers/block/nvme-core.c: In function 'nvme_submit_io':
drivers/block/nvme-core.c:1847:4: warning: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Wint-to-pointer-cast]
    (void __user *)io.addr, length, NULL, 0);

The cast here is intentional and safe, so we can shut up the
gcc warning by adding an intermediate cast to 'uintptr_t'.

I had previously submitted a patch to fix this problem in the
nvme driver, but it was accepted on the same day that two new
warnings got added.

For clarification, I also change the third instance of this cast
to use uintptr_t instead of unsigned long now.
