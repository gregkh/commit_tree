KVM: MMU: fix validation of mmio page fault

We got the bug that qemu complained with "KVM: unknown exit, hardware
reason 31" and KVM shown these info:
[84245.284948] EPT: Misconfiguration.
[84245.285056] EPT: GPA: 0xfeda848
[84245.285154] ept_misconfig_inspect_spte: spte 0x5eaef50107 level 4
[84245.285344] ept_misconfig_inspect_spte: spte 0x5f5fadc107 level 3
[84245.285532] ept_misconfig_inspect_spte: spte 0x5141d18107 level 2
[84245.285723] ept_misconfig_inspect_spte: spte 0x52e40dad77 level 1

This is because we got a mmio #PF and the handler see the mmio spte becomes
normal (points to the ram page)

However, this is valid after introducing fast mmio spte invalidation which
increases the generation-number instead of zapping mmio sptes, a example
is as follows:
1. QEMU drops mmio region by adding a new memslot
2. invalidate all mmio sptes
3.

        VCPU 0                        VCPU 1
    access the invalid mmio spte
                            access the region originally was MMIO before
                            set the spte to the normal ram map

    mmio #PF
    check the spte and see it becomes normal ram mapping !!!

This patch fixes the bug just by dropping the check in mmio handler, it's
good for backport. Full check will be introduced in later patches
