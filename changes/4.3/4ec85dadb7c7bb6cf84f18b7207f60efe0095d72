staging: comedi: me4000: remove 'board' from me4000_ai_check_chanlist()

The maximum differential channel is half the subdevice 'n_chan'. Use
that instead and remove the need for the 'board' variable.

Also, the comedi core does no validate the aref flags. Add a check
to ensure that the subdevice actually supports the AREF_DIFF mode.
