Input: uinput - fix crash when using ABS events

Commit b6d30968d86c45a7bb599eaca13ff048d3fa576c (Input: uinput - switch to
using for_each_set_bit()) switched driver to use for_each_set_bit().
However during initial write of the uinput structure that contains min/max
data for all possible axes none of them are reflected in dev->absbit yet
and so we were skipping over all of them and were not allocating absinfo
memory which caused crash later when driver tried to sens EV_ABS events:
