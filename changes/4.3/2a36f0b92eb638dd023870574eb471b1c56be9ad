bpf: Make the bpf_prog_array_map more generic

All the map backends are of generic nature. In order to avoid
adding much special code into the eBPF core, rewrite part of
the bpf_prog_array map code and make it more generic. So the
new perf_event_array map type can reuse most of code with
bpf_prog_array map and add fewer lines of special code.
