staging: unisys: stop device registration before visorbus registration

In cases where visorbus is compiled directly into the kernel, if
visorbus registration fails for any reason, it is still possible for
other drivers to call visorbus_register_visor_driver(), which could
cause an oops. Prevent this by saving the result of the call to
create_bus() in a static variable, and return an error code when the bus
hasn't been registered successfully.
