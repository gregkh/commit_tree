ath10k: set 10.4 fw exclusive wmi cmd as unsupported for other fw versions

In fact, explicit assigned to ZERO for unsupported wmi commands
are not really needed. Global static variable will have ZERO by
default. However, just for better readability setting all wmi cmds
in non 10.4 firmware wmi mapping table as unsupported for wmi cmd
which are exclusively available only in 10.4 firmware.
