drivers: usb: fsl: Workaround for USB erratum-A005275

Incoming packets in high speed are randomly corrupted by h/w
resulting in multiple errors. This workaround makes FS as
default mode in all affected socs by disabling HS chirp
signalling.This errata does not affect FS and LS mode.

Forces all HS devices to connect in FS mode for all socs
affected by this erratum:
P3041 and P2041 rev 1.0 and 1.1
P5020 and P5010 rev 1.0 and 2.0
P5040, P1010 and T4240 rev 1.0
