i40e/i40evf: Fix and refactor dynamic ITR code

This patch changes the switch statement for dynamic interrupt throttling
and adds a default case. With this patch, we check the latency setting
instead of the current ITR settings and the included refactor improves
performance.

Without this patch, the ITR setting would never change dynamically, and
there was no default.
