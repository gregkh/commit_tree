lib/iommu-common.c: do not try to deref a null iommu->lazy_flush() pointer when n < pool->hint

The check for invoking iommu->lazy_flush() from iommu_tbl_range_alloc()
has to be refactored so that we only call ->lazy_flush() if it is
non-null.

I had a sparc kernel that was crashing when I was trying to process some
very large perf.data files- the crash happens when the scsi driver calls
into dma_4v_map_sg and thus the iommu_tbl_range_alloc().
