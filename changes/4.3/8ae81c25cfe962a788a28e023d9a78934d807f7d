arm: perf: Set affinity for PPI based PMUs

For PPI based PMUs, we bail out early in of_pmu_irq_cfg() without
setting the PMU's supported_cpus bitmap. This causes the
smp_call_function_any() in armv7_probe_num_events() to fail. Set
the bitmap to be all CPUs so that we properly probe PMUs that use
PPIs.
