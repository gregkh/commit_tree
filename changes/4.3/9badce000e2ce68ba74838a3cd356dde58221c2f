cgroup, writeback: don't enable cgroup writeback on traditional hierarchies

inode_cgwb_enabled() gates cgroup writeback support.  If it returns
true, each inode is attached to the corresponding memory domain which
gets mapped to io domain.  It currently only tests whether the
filesystem and bdi support cgroup writeback; however, cgroup writeback
support doesn't work on traditional hierarchies and thus it should
also test whether memcg and iocg are on the default hierarchy.

This caused traditional hierarchy setups to hit the cgroup writeback
path inadvertently and ended up creating separate writeback domains
for each memcg and mapping them all to the root iocg uncovering a
couple issues in the cgroup writeback path.

cgroup writeback was never meant to be enabled on traditional
hierarchies.  Make inode_cgwb_enabled() test whether both memcg and
iocg are on the default hierarchy.
