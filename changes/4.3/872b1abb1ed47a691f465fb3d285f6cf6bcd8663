flow_dissector: Add flag to stop parsing when an IPv6 flow label is seen

Add an input flag to flow dissector on rather dissection should be
stopped when a flow label is encountered. Presumably, the flow label
is derived from a sufficient hash of an inner transport packet so
further dissection is not needed (that is ports are not included in
the flow hash). Using the flow label instead of ports has the additional
benefit that packet fragments should hash to same value as non-fragments
for a flow (assuming that the same flow label is used).

We set this flag by default in for skb_get_hash.
