ASoC: rsnd: tidyup data align position

Sound L/R order of SSI is different from Linux sound data order.
So current rsnd driver is using DALIGN (= data align) to exchange data
align on SSIU. OTOH, CMD/SRC/SSIU have DALIGN register. Now inverted
sound volume will be exchanged if user used volume control on DVC.
Because SSIU which exchanges data align is located after DVC.

	MEM -> SRC -> DVC -> SSI

This patch exchanges data align SRC if possible
