cfq-iosched: simplify control flow in cfq_get_queue()

cfq_get_queue()'s control flow looks like the following.

	async_cfqq = NULL;
	cfqq = NULL;

	if (!is_sync) {
		...
		async_cfqq = ...;
		cfqq = *async_cfqq;
	}

	if (!cfqq)
		cfqq = ...;

	if (!is_sync && !(*async_cfqq))
		...;

The only thing the local variable init, the second if, and the
async_cfqq test in the third if achieves is to skip cfqq creation and
installation if *async_cfqq was already non-NULL.  This is needlessly
complicated with different tests examining the same condition.
Simplify it to the following.

	if (!is_sync) {
		...
		async_cfqq = ...;
		cfqq = *async_cfqq;
		if (cfqq)
			goto out;
	}

	cfqq = ...;

	if (!is_sync)
		...;
