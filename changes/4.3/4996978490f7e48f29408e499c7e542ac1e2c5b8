clockevents/drivers/bcm2835: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate bcm2835 driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
the clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked
obsolete now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

We weren't doing anything in the ->set_mode() callback. So, this patch
doesn't provide any set-state callbacks.
