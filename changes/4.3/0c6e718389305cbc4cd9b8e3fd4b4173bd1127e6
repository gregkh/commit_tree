rtc: armada38x: Align RTC set time procedure with the official errata

According to the Armada38x functional errata FE-3124064, writing to
the RTC TIME register may fail. As a workaround, after writing to RTC
TIME register, issue a dummy write of 0x0 twice to the RTC Status
register.  This is the updated implementation of the Errata that
eliminates the need of the long 100ms delay during the RTC set time
procedure.

spinlock again
