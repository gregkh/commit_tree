target/user: Fix UFLAG_UNKNOWN_OP handling

Calling transport_generic_request_failure() from here causes list
corruption. We should be using target_complete_cmd() instead.

Which we do in all other cases, so the UNKNOWN_OP case can become just
another member of the big else/if chain in tcmu_handle_completion().
