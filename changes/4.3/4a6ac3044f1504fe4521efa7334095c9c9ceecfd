irqchip/GIC: Fix EOImode setting for non-DT/ACPI systems

Non-DT/ACPI systems call directly into the GIC driver at init time.
Turns out 0b996fd35957 ("irqchip/GIC: Convert to EOImode == 1")
breaks old non firmware-driven platforms, as the driver only
works out the capability of the platform on the DT/ACPI paths.

Fix this thinko by forcing EOImode==0 on non-DT platforms,
which are not capable of supporting a hypervisor anyway.
