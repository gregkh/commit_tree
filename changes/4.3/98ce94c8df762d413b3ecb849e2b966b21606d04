cifs: use server timestamp for ntlmv2 authentication

Linux cifs mount with ntlmssp against an Mac OS X (Yosemite
10.10.5) share fails in case the clocks differ more than +/-2h:

digest-service: digest-request: od failed with 2 proto=ntlmv2
digest-service: digest-request: kdc failed with -1561745592 proto=ntlmv2

Fix this by (re-)using the given server timestamp for the
ntlmv2 authentication (as Windows 7 does).

A related problem was also reported earlier by Namjae Jaen (see below):

Windows machine has extended security feature which refuse to allow
authentication when there is time difference between server time and
client time when ntlmv2 negotiation is used. This problem is prevalent
in embedded enviornment where system time is set to default 1970.

Modern servers send the server timestamp in the TargetInfo Av_Pair
structure in the challenge message [see MS-NLMP 2.2.2.1]
In [MS-NLMP 3.1.5.1.2] it is explicitly mentioned that the client must
use the server provided timestamp if present OR current time if it is
not
