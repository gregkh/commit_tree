drm/i915: Handle return value in intel_pin_and_fence_fb_obj, v2.

-EDEADLK has special meaning in atomic, but get_fence may call
i915_find_fence_reg which can return -EDEADLK.

This has special meaning in the atomic world, so convert the error
to -EBUSY for this case.

Changes since v1:
- Add comment in the code.
