drm/panel: simple: Add bus format for HannStar HSD070PWW1 LVDS panel

The bus format both specifies the bpc and the way the individual bits get
serialized into the 7 LVDS timeslots.

While the is only one standard mapping for 6 bpc and so the driver could
infer the bit mapping from the bpc alone, there are more options for the
8 bpc case which makes specifiying the bus format mandatory.
To keep things consistent across panels and to set a precedent for new
panel additions add the proper bus format.
