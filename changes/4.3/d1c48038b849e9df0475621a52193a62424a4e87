HID: i2c-hid: Only disable irq wake if it was successfully enabled during suspend

Enabling irq wake could potentially fail and calling disable_irq_wake
after a failed call to enable_irq_wake could result in an unbalanced irq
warning. This patch warns if enable_irq_wake fails and avoids other
potential issues caused by calling disable_irq_wake on resume after
enable_irq_wake failed during suspend.
