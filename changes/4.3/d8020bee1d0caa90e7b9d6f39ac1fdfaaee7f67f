perf/x86/intel: Handle new arch perfmon v4 status bits

ArchPerfmon v4 has some new status bits in GLOBAL_STATUS.

These need to be ignored when deciding whether a NMI
was an NMI, to avoid eating all NMIs when they
stay set, see:

    b292d7a10487 ("perf/x86/intel: ignore CondChgd bit to avoid false NMI handling")

This patch ignores the new ASIF bit, which indicates
that SGX interfered with the PMU, and also the new
LBR freezing bits, which are set when the LBRs get
frozen, plus the existing CondChange (set by JTAG
debuggers and some buggy BIOSes)
