ARM: dts: fix omap2+ address translation for pbias

"ARM: dts: <omap2/omap4/omap5/dra7>: add minimal l4 bus
layout with control module support" moved pbias_regulator dt node
from being a child node of ocp to be the child node of
'syscon'. Since 'syscon' doesn't have the 'ranges' property,
address translation fails while trying to convert the address
to resource. Fix it here by populating 'ranges' property in
syscon dt node.
