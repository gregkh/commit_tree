HID: sony: Fix DS4 controller reporting rate issues

This commit removes the cap on the DualShock 4 controller reporting rate when
connected using Bluetooth. The previous value of '0xB0' capped the rate to only
20.83 Hz which many userspace utilities mistook as a sign of a bad signal.
Since a 'B' and an '8' can look similar it's possible that someone mistook the
one for another.  The new value of '0x80' enables the full 1000 Hz peak
reporting rate that the controller is capable of.

Frank adds: "Back when the original code was written the purpose of that value
was unknown and 0xB0 seemed to work so that's what ended up being used.  Now
that we know what it actually does and that 0x80 is a better choice I support
this patch."
