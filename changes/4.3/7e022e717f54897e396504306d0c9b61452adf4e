KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Pass the correct trap argument to kvmhv_commence_exit

In guest_exit_cont we call kvmhv_commence_exit which expects the trap
number as the argument. However r3 doesn't contain the trap number at
this point and as a result we would be calling the function with a
spurious trap number.

Fix this by copying r12 into r3 before calling kvmhv_commence_exit as
r12 contains the trap number.
