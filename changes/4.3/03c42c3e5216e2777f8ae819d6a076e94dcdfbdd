pinctrl: sh-pfc: Remove obsolete r8a7740 platform_device_id entry

Since the removal of the r8a7740 legacy SoC code in commit
44d88c754e57a6d9 ("ARM: shmobile: Remove legacy SoC code for R-Mobile
A1"), r8a7740 is only supported in generic DT-only ARM multi-platform
builds.  The driver doesn't need to match platform devices by name
anymore, hence remove the corresponding platform_device_id entry.
