NTB: Improve index handling in B2B MW workaround

Check that b2b_mw_idx is in range of the number of memory windows when
initializing the device.  The workaround is considered to be in effect
only if the device b2b_idx is exactly UINT_MAX, instead of any index
past the last memory window.

Only print B2B MW workaround information in debugfs if the workaround is
in effect.
