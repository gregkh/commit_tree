kernel/watchdog: move NMI function header declarations from watchdog.h to nmi.h

The kernel's NMI watchdog has nothing to do with the watchdog subsystem.
Its header declarations should be in linux/nmi.h, not linux/watchdog.h.

The code provided two sets of dummy functions if HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR is
not configured, one in the include file and one in kernel/watchdog.c.
Remove the dummy functions from kernel/watchdog.c and use those from the
include file.
