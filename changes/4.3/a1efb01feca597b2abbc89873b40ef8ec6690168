jump_label, locking/static_keys: Rename JUMP_LABEL_TYPE_* and related helpers to the static_key* pattern

Rename the JUMP_LABEL_TYPE_* macros to be JUMP_TYPE_* and move the
inline helpers into kernel/jump_label.c, since that's the only place
they're ever used.

Also rename the helpers where it's all about static keys.

This is the second step in removing the naming confusion that has led to
a stream of avoidable bugs such as:
