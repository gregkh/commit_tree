ARM: tegra: Fix AHB base address on Tegra20, Tegra30 and Tegra114

Current base address is wrong by 0x04 bytes for AHB bus device as shown
in dmesg:

	tegra-ahb 6000c004.ahb: incorrect AHB base address in DT data - enabling workaround

To correct old DTBs, commit ce7a10b0ff3d ("ARM: 8334/1: amba: tegra-ahb:
detect and correct bogus base address") checks for the low bit of the
base address and removes theses 0x04 bytes at runtime.

This patch fixes the original DTS, so upstream version doesn't need the
workaround of the base address.

As both addresses are valid, this patch doesn't break compatibility.

Tested on tegra20-paz00 (aka ac100).
