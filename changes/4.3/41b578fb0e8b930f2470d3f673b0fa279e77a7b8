drm/i915: workaround bad DSL readout v3

On HSW at least (still testing other platforms, but should be harmless
elsewhere), the DSL reg reads back as 0 when read around vblank start
time.  This ends up confusing the atomic start/end checking code, since
it causes the update to appear as if it crossed a frame count boundary.
Avoid the problem by making sure we don't return scanline_offset from
the get_crtc_scanline function.  In moving the code there, I add to add
an additional delay since it could be called and have a legitimate 0
result for some time (depending on the pixel clock).

v2: move hsw dsl read hack to get_crtc_scanline (Ville)
v3: use break instead of goto (Ville)
