tipc: introduce new tipc_sk_respond() function

Currently, we use the code sequence

if (msg_reverse())
   tipc_link_xmit_skb()

at numerous locations in socket.c. The preparation of arguments
for these calls, as well as the sequence itself, makes the code
unecessarily complex.

In this commit, we introduce a new function, tipc_sk_respond(),
that performs this call combination. We also replace some, but not
yet all, of these explicit call sequences with calls to the new
function. Notably, we let the function tipc_sk_proto_rcv() use
the new function to directly send out PROBE_REPLY messages,
instead of deferring this to the calling tipc_sk_rcv() function,
as we do now.
