xtensa: implement fake NMI

In case perf IRQ is the highest of the medium-level IRQs, and is alone
on its level, it may be treated as NMI:
- LOCKLEVEL is defined to be one level less than EXCM level,
- IRQ masking never lowers current IRQ level,
- new fake exception cause code, EXCCAUSE_MAPPED_NMI is assigned to that
  IRQ; new second level exception handler, do_nmi, assigned to it
  handles it as NMI,
- atomic operations in configurations without s32c1i still need to mask
  all interrupts.
