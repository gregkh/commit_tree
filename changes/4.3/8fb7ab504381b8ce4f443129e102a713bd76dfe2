usb: phy: isp1301: Export I2C module alias information

The I2C core always reports the MODALIAS uevent as "i2c:<client name"
regardless if the device was registered using OF or platform code so
So the driver needs to export the I2C table and this be built into
the module or udev won't have the necessary information to auto load
the module when the device is added.
