NFS: Fix a write performance regression

If all other conditions in nfs_can_extend_write() are met, and there
are no locks, then we should be able to assume close-to-open semantics
and the ability to extend our write to cover the whole page.

With this patch, the xfstests generic/074 test completes in 242s instead
of >1400s on my test rig.
