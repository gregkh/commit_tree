nfsd: deal with DELEGRETURN racing with CB_RECALL

We have observed the server sending recalls for delegation stateids
that have already been successfully returned. Change
nfsd4_cb_recall_done() to return success if the client has returned
the delegation. While this does not completely eliminate the sending
of recalls for delegations that have already been returned, this
does prevent unnecessarily declaring the callback path to be down.
