cxlflash: Virtual LUN support

Add support for physical LUN segmentation (virtual LUNs) to device
driver supporting the IBM CXL Flash adapter. This patch allows user
space applications to virtually segment a physical LUN into N virtual
LUNs, taking advantage of the translation features provided by this
adapter.
