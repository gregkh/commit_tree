KVM: PPC: Book3S: Take the kvm->srcu lock in kvmppc_h_logical_ci_load/store()

Access to the kvm->buses (like with the kvm_io_bus_read() and -write()
functions) has to be protected via the kvm->srcu lock.
The kvmppc_h_logical_ci_load() and -store() functions are missing
this lock so far, so let's add it there, too.
This fixes the problem that the kernel reports "suspicious RCU usage"
when lock debugging is enabled.
