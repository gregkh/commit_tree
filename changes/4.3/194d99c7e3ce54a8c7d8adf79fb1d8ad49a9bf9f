cpufreq: Replace recover_policy with new_policy in cpufreq_online()

The recover_policy is unsed in cpufreq_online() to indicate whether
a new policy object is created or an existing one is reinitialized.

The "recover" part of the name is slightly confusing (it should be
"reinitialization" rather than "recovery") and the logical not (!)
operator is applied to it in almost all of the checks it is used in,
so replace that variable with a new one called "new_policy" that
will be true in the case of a new policy creation.

While at it, drop one of the labels that is jumped to from only
one spot.
