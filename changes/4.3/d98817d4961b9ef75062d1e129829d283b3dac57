cgroup: don't print subsystems for the default hierarchy

It doesn't make sense to print subsystems on mount option or
/proc/PID/cgroup for the default hierarchy.

* cgroup.controllers file at the root of the default hierarchy lists
  the currently attached controllers.

* The default hierarchy is catch-all for unmounted subsystems.

* The default hierarchy doesn't accept any mount options.

Suppress subsystem printing on mount options and /proc/PID/cgroup for
the default hierarchy.
