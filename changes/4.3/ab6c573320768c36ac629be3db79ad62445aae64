ACPICA: Executer: Add interpreter tracing mode for method tracing facility

ACPICA commit 07fffd02607685b655ed92ee15c160e6a810b60b

The acpi_debug_trace() is the mechanism known as ACPI method tracing that is
used by Linux as ACPICA debugging message reducer. This facility can be
controlled through Linux ACPI subsystem - /sys/module/acpi/parameters.
This facility requires CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG to be enabled to see ACPICA trace
logs in the kernel dmesg output.

This patch enhances acpi_debug_trace() to make it not only a message reducer,
but a real tracer to trace AML interpreter execution. Note that in addition
to the AML tracer enabling, this patch also updates the facility with the
following enhancements:
1. Allow a full path to be specified by the acpi_debug_trace() API.
2. Allow any method rather than just the entrance of acpi_evaluate_object()
   to be traced.
3. All interpreter ACPI_LV_TRACE_POINT messages are collected for
   ACPI_EXECUTER layer.

The Makefile of drivers/acpi/acpica is also updated to include exdebug.o
and the duplicated stubs are removed after that.

Note that since this patch has enhanced the method tracing facility, Linux
need also be updated after applying this patch. Lv Zheng.
