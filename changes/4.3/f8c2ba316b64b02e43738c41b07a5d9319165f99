    drm: Check locking in drm_for_each_connector

we started checking the locking in drm_for_each_connector but somehow
I totally missed drm_mode_config_reset. There's no problem there since
this function should only be called in single-threaded contexts
(driver load or resume), so just wrap the loop with the right lock.

v2: Drink coffee and all that ...
