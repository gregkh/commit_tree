perf record: Apply filter to all events in a glob matching

There is an old problem in perf's filter applying which first posted at
Sep. 2014 at https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/9/9/944 that, if passing
multiple events in a glob matching expression in cmdline then add
'--filter' after them, the filter will be applied on only the last one.

For example:

 # dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/null &
 [1] 464
 # perf record -a -e 'syscalls:sys_*_read' --filter 'common_pid != 464' sleep 0.1
 [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
 [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.239 MB perf.data (2094 samples) ]
 # perf report --stdio | tee
 ...
 # Samples: 2K of event 'syscalls:sys_enter_read'
 # Event count (approx.): 2092
 ...
 # Samples: 2  of event 'syscalls:sys_exit_read'
 # Event count (approx.): 2
 ...

In this example, filter only applied on 'syscalls:sys_exit_read', and
there's no way to set filter for ''syscalls:sys_enter_read'.

This patch adds a 'cmdline_group_boundary' for 'struct evsel', and
apply filter on all events between two boundary marks.

After applying this patch:

 # perf record -a -e 'syscalls:sys_*_read' --filter 'common_pid != 464' sleep 0.1
 [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
 [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.031 MB perf.data (3 samples) ]
 # perf report --stdio | tee
 ...
 # Samples: 1  of event 'syscalls:sys_enter_read'
 # Event count (approx.): 1
 ...
 # Samples: 2  of event 'syscalls:sys_exit_read'
 # Event count (approx.): 2
 ...
