ARM: sunxi_defconfig: Enable DMA_SUN6I, P2WI, PWM, cryptodev, EXTCON, FHANDLE

Enable sun6i DMA engine, sun6i P2WI, PWM, and crypto engine (Security
System) drivers by default. EXTCON is needed by the updated sun4i USB
PHY driver.

While at it, enable FHANDLE, which is needed by systemd and newer
versions of udev. Also enable CGROUPS for systemd.

And get rid of POWER_RESET, as the sun6i power reset driver has been
removed in favor of proper sun6i watchdog support.
