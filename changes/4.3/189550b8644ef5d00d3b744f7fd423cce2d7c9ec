serial: imx: introduce serial_imx_enable_wakeup()

This change is a code reorganization. Here we introduce
serial_imx_enable_wakeup() helper function to do
the job of configuring and preparing wakeup sources
on imx serial device. The idea is to allow other
parts of the code to call this function whenever
the device is known to go to idle.
