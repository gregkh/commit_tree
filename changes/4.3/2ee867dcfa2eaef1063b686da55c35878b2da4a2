blkcg: implement interface for the unified hierarchy

blkcg interface grew to be the biggest of all controllers and
unfortunately most inconsistent too.  The interface files are
inconsistent with a number of cloes duplicates.  Some files have
recursive variants while others don't.  There's distinction between
normal and leaf weights which isn't intuitive and there are a lot of
stat knobs which don't make much sense outside of debugging and expose
too much implementation details to userland.

In the unified hierarchy, everything is always hierarchical and
internal nodes can't have tasks rendering the two structural issues
twisting the current interface.  The interface has to be updated in a
significant anyway and this is a good chance to revamp it as a whole.
This patch implements blkcg interface for the unified hierarchy.

* (from a previous patch) blkcg is identified by "io" instead of
  "blkio" on the unified hierarchy.  Given that the whole interface is
  updated anyway, the rename shouldn't carry noticeable conversion
  overhead.

* The original interface consisted of 27 files is replaced with the
  following three files.

  blkio.stat	: per-blkcg stats
  blkio.weight	: per-cgroup and per-cgroup-queue weight settings
  blkio.max	: per-cgroup-queue bps and iops max limits

Documentation/cgroups/unified-hierarchy.txt updated accordingly.

v2: blkcg_policy->dfl_cftypes wasn't removed on
    blkcg_policy_unregister() corrupting the cftypes list.  Fixed.
