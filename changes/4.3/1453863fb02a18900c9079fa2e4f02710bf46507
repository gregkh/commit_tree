cpufreq: mediatek: Add MT8173 cpufreq driver

Mediatek MT8173 is an ARMv8 based quad-core (2*Cortex-A53 and
2*Cortex-A72) SoC with duall clusters. For each cluster, two voltage
inputs, Vproc and Vsram are supplied by two regulators. For the big
cluster, two regulators come from different PMICs. In this case, when
scaling voltage inputs of the cluster, the voltages of two regulator
inputs need to be controlled by software explicitly under the SoC
specific limitation:

	100mV < Vsram - Vproc < 200mV

which is called 'voltage tracking' mechanism. And when scaling the
frequency of cluster clock input, the input MUX need to be parented to
another "intermediate" stable PLL first and reparented to the original
PLL once the original PLL is stable at the target frequency. This patch
implements those mechanisms to enable CPU DVFS support for Mediatek
MT8173 SoC.
