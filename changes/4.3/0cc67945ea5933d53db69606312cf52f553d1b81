mailbox: switch to hrtimer for tx_complete polling

The mailbox core uses jiffy based timer to handle polling for the
transmit completion. If the client/protocol have/support notification
of the last packet transmit completion via ACK packet, then we tick the
Tx state machine immediately in the callback. However if the client
doesn't support that mechanism we might end-up waiting for atleast a
jiffy even though the remote is ready to receive the next request.

This patch switches the timer used for that polling from jiffy-based
to hrtimer-based so that we can support polling at much higher time
resolution.
