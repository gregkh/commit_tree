memory: tegra: Add support for a variable-size client ID bitfield

Recent versions of the Tegra MC hardware extend the size of the client
ID bitfield in the MC_ERR_STATUS register by one bit.  While one could
simply extend the bitfield for older hardware, that would allow data
from reserved bits into the driver code, which is generally a bad idea
on principle.  So this patch instead passes in the client ID mask from
from the per-SoC MC data.

There's no MC support for T210 (yet), but when that support winds up
in the kernel, the appropriate soc->client_id_mask value for that chip
will be 0xff.

Based on an original patch by David Ung <davidu@nvidia.com>.
