NFS: Check size by inode_newsize_ok in nfs_setattr

Set rlimit for NFS's files is useless right now.
For local process's rlimit, it should be checked by nfs client.

The same, CIFS also call inode_change_ok checking rlimit at its client
in cifs_setattr_nounix() and cifs_setattr_unix().

v3, fix bad using of error
