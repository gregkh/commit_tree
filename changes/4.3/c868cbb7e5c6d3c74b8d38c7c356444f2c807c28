serial: imx: save and restore context in the suspend path

This change teaches the imx serial driver to save its
context and restore it across suspend and resume path.
To do so, it introduces serial_imx_restore_context()
and serial_imx_save_context() functions. They use
a shadow set of registers to save key registers
and restore them accordingly. These functions can
be reused on other situations, when the device
context is lost.
