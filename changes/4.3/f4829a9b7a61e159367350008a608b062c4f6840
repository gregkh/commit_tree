blk-mq: fix racy updates of rq->errors

blk_mq_complete_request may be a no-op if the request has already
been completed by others means (e.g. a timeout or cancellation), but
currently drivers have to set rq->errors before calling
blk_mq_complete_request, which might leave us with the wrong error value.

Add an error parameter to blk_mq_complete_request so that we can
defer setting rq->errors until we known we won the race to complete the
request.
