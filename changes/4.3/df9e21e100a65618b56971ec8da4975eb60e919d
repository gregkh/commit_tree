crypto: qat - enable legacy VFs

We need to support legacy VFs as well as VFs running on different OSes.
To do so the compatibility check need needs to be relaxed.
This patch moves the logic responsible for VF to PF version and
compatibility checking from adfsriov.c to adf_pf2vf_msg.c,
where it belongs, and changes the logic enable legacy VFs.
