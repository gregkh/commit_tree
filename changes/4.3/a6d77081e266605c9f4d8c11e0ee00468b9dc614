rcu: Limit rcu_state::levelcnt[] to RCU_NUM_LVLS items

Variable rcu_num_lvls is limited by RCU_NUM_LVLS macro.
In turn, rcu_state::levelcnt[] array is never accessed
beyond rcu_num_lvls. Thus, rcu_state::levelcnt[] is safe
to limit to RCU_NUM_LVLS items.

Since rcu_num_lvls could be changed during boot (as result
of rcutree.rcu_fanout_leaf kernel parameter update) one might
assume a new value could overflow the value of RCU_NUM_LVLS.
However, that is not the case, since leaf-level fanout is only
permitted to increase, resulting in rcu_num_lvls possibly to
decrease.
