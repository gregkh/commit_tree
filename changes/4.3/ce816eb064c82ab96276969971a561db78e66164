solos-pci: Increase headroom on received packets

A comment in include/linux/skbuff.h says that:

 * Various parts of the networking layer expect at least 32 bytes of
 * headroom, you should not reduce this.

This was demonstrated by a panic when handling fragmented IPv6 packets:

It's not entirely clear if that comment is still valid — and if it is,
perhaps netif_rx() ought to be enforcing it with a warning.

But either way, it is rather stupid from a performance point of view
for us to be receiving packets into a buffer which doesn't have enough
room to prepend an Ethernet header — it means that *every* incoming
packet is going to be need to be reallocated. So let's fix that.
