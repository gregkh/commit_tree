arm64: kernel: Add min_field_value and use '>=' for feature detection

When a new cpu feature is available, the cpu feature bits will have some
initial value, which is incremented when the feature is updated.
This patch changes 'register_value' to be 'min_field_value', and checks
the feature bits value (interpreted as a signed int) is greater than this
minimum.
