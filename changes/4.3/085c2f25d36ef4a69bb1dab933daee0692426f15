MIPS: Fix R2300 FP context switch handling

Commit 1a3d59579b9f ("MIPS: Tidy up FPU context switching") removed FP
context saving from the asm-written resume function in favour of reusing
existing code to perform the same task. However it only removed the FP
context saving code from the r4k_switch.S implementation of resume.
Remove it from the r2300_switch.S implementation too in order to prevent
attempting to save the FP context twice, which would likely lead to an
exception from the second save because the FPU had already been disabled
by the first save.

This patch has only been build tested, using rbtx49xx_defconfig.
