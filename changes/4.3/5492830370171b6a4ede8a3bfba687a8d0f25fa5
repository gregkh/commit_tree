KVM: svm: handle KVM_X86_QUIRK_CD_NW_CLEARED in svm_get_mt_mask

We can disable CD unconditionally when there is no assigned device.
KVM now forces guest PAT to all-writeback in that case, so it makes
sense to also force CR0.CD=0.

When there are assigned devices, emulate cache-disabled operation
through the page tables.  This behavior is consistent with VMX
microcode, where CD/NW are not touched by vmentry/vmexit.  However,
keep this dependent on the quirk because OVMF enables the caches
too late.
