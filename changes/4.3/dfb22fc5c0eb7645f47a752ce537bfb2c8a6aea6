thermal: fix intel PCH thermal driver mismerge

I didn't notice this when merging the thermal code from Zhang, but his
merge (commit 5a924a07f882: "Merge branches 'thermal-core' and
'thermal-intel' of .git into next") of the thermal-core and
thermal-intel branches was wrong.

In thermal-core, commit 17e8351a7739 ("thermal: consistently use int for
temperatures") converted the thermal layer to use "int" for
temperatures.

But in parallel, in the thermal-intel branch commit d0a12625d2ff
("thermal: Add Intel PCH thermal driver") added support for the intel
PCH thermal sensor using the old interfaces that used "unsigned long"
pointers.

This resulted in warnings like this:

  drivers/thermal/intel_pch_thermal.c:184:14: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
    .get_temp = pch_thermal_get_temp,
                ^
  drivers/thermal/intel_pch_thermal.c:184:14: note: (near initialization for ‘tzd_ops.get_temp’)
  drivers/thermal/intel_pch_thermal.c:186:19: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]
    .get_trip_temp = pch_get_trip_temp,
                     ^
  drivers/thermal/intel_pch_thermal.c:186:19: note: (near initialization for ‘tzd_ops.get_trip_temp’)

This fixes it.
