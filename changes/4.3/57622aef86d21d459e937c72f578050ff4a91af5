ASoC: wm8962: balance pm_runtime_enable

pm_runtime_enable is called in probe to enable runtime PM
for wm8962 codec, but pm_runtime_disable isn't called in remove
callback, nor is called in error path if probe fails after runtime
PM is enabled, this causes unbalanced pm_runtime_enable.

This patch Adds pm_runtime_disable in remove callback and error path,
to balance pm_runtime_enable.
