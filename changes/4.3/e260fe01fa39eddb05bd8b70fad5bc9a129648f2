scripts: decode_stacktrace: fix ARM architecture decoding

Fix the stack decoder for the ARM architecture.
An ARM stack is designed as :

[   81.547704] [<c023eb04>] (bucket_find_contain) from [<c023ec88>] (check_sync+0x40/0x4f8)
[   81.559668] [<c023ec88>] (check_sync) from [<c023f8c4>] (debug_dma_sync_sg_for_cpu+0x128/0x194)
[   81.571583] [<c023f8c4>] (debug_dma_sync_sg_for_cpu) from [<c0327dec>] (__videobuf_s

The current script doesn't expect the symbols to be bound by
parenthesis, and triggers the following errors :

  awk: cmd. line:1: error: Unmatched ( or \(: / (check_sync$/
  [   81.547704] (bucket_find_contain) from (check_sync+0x40/0x4f8)

Fix it by chopping starting and ending parenthesis from the each symbol
name.

As a side note, this probably comes from the function
dump_backtrace_entry(), which is implemented differently for each
architecture.  That makes a single decoding script a bit a challenge.
