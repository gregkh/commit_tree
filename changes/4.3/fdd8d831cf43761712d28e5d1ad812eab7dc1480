ACPICA: Debugger: Move debugger specific APIs to debugger component

ACPICA commit 2164923d60429eea7cd5a4a8629b607af7325afa

Some disassembler APIs should rather be debugger APIs. This patch moves
them to the debugger folder to be ready for debugger porting.

Since there is no in-kernel ACPICA debugger in the kernel source tree, this
patch doesn't affect the Linux kernel.
