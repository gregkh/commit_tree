s390/bpf: Only clear A and X for converted BPF programs

Only classic BPF programs that have been converted to eBPF need to clear
the A and X registers. We can check for converted programs with:

  bpf_prog->type == BPF_PROG_TYPE_UNSPEC

So add the check and skip initialization for real eBPF programs.
