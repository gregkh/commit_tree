char: xillybus: Allow 64-bit DMA on PCIe interface

Until now, only 32-bit DMA addressing was allowed, following a report on
some old Intel machine that dropped 64-bit PCIe packets, even though
pci_set_dma_mask() was successful with DMA_BIT_MASK(64).

But then came TI's Keystone II chip (ARM Cortex A15 + DSPs), which refuses
32-bit DMA addressing (for good reasons). So 64-bit DMA is allowed as a
fallback option.
