locking/qspinlock/x86: Fix performance regression under unaccelerated VMs

Dave ran into horrible performance on a VM without PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS
set and Linus noted that the test-and-set implementation was retarded.

One should spin on the variable with a load, not a RMW.

While there, remove 'queued' from the name, as the lock isn't queued
at all, but a simple test-and-set.
