bpf: fix out of bounds access in verifier log

when the verifier log is enabled the print_bpf_insn() is doing
bpf_alu_string[BPF_OP(insn->code) >> 4]
and
bpf_jmp_string[BPF_OP(insn->code) >> 4]
where BPF_OP is a 4-bit instruction opcode.
Malformed insns can cause out of bounds access.
Fix it by sizing arrays appropriately.

The bug was found by clang address sanitizer with libfuzzer.
