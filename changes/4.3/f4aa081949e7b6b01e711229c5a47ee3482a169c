perf tools: Add Intel PT decoder

Add support for decoding an Intel Processor Trace.

Intel PT trace data must be 'decoded' which involves walking the object
code and matching the trace data packets.

The decoder requests a buffer of binary data via a get_trace()
call-back, which it decodes using instruction information which it gets
via another call-back walk_insn().
