IB/mlx5: avoid destroying a NULL mr in reg_user_mr error flow

The mlx5_ib_reg_user_mr() function will attempt to call clean_mr() in
its error flow even though there is never a case where the error flow
occurs with a valid MR pointer to destroy.

Remove the clean_mr() call and the incorrect comment above it.

support for MMU notifiers")
