clk: check for invalid parent index of orphans in __clk_init()

If a mux clock is initialised (by hardware or firmware) with an
invalid parent, its ->get_parent() can return an out of range
index.  For example, the generic mux clock attempts to return
-EINVAL, which due to the u8 return type ends up a rather large
number.  Using this index with the parent_names[] array results
in an invalid pointer and (usually) a crash in the following
strcmp().

This patch adds a check for the parent index being in range,
ignoring clocks reporting invalid values.
