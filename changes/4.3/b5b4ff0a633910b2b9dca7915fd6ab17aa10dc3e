mmc: block: skip trim for some kingston eMMCs

For some mass production of kingston eMMCs which adopt Phison's
firmware will meet an unrecoverable data conrruption occasionally
if performing trim due to a firmware bug confirmed by vendor. We
found it on Intel-C3230RK platform. So we add fixup of broken trim
for it.
