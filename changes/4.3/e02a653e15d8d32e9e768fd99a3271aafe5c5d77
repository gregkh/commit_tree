PCI,parisc: Enable 64-bit bus addresses on PA-RISC

Commit 3a9ad0b ("PCI: Add pci_bus_addr_t") unconditionally introduced usage of
64-bit PCI bus addresses on all 64-bit platforms which broke PA-RISC.

It turned out that due to enabling the 64-bit addresses, the PCI logic decided
to use the GMMIO instead of the LMMIO region. This commit simply disables
registering the GMMIO and thus we fall back to use the LMMIO region as before.

Reverts commit 45ea2a5fed6dacb9bb0558d8b21eacc1c45d5bb4
("PCI: Don't use 64-bit bus addresses on PA-RISC")
