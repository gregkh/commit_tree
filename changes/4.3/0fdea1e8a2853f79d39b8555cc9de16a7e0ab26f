SUNRPC: Ensure that we wait for connections to complete before retrying

Commit 718ba5b87343, moved the responsibility for unlocking the socket to
xs_tcp_setup_socket, meaning that the socket will be unlocked before we
know that it has finished trying to connect. The following patch is based on
an initial patch by Russell King to ensure that we delay clearing the
XPRT_CONNECTING flag until we either know that we failed to initiate
a connection attempt, or the connection attempt itself failed.
