lib/bitmap.c: bitmap_parselist can accept string with whitespaces on head or tail

In __bitmap_parselist we can accept whitespaces on head or tail during
every parsing procedure.  If input has valid ranges, there is no reason to
reject the user.

For example, bitmap_parselist(" 1-3, 5, ", &mask, nmaskbits).  After
separating the string, we get " 1-3", " 5", and " ".  It's possible and
reasonable to accept such string as long as the parsing result is correct.
