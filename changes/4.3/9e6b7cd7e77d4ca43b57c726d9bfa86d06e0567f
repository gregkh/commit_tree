tty: fix data race in tty_buffer_flush

tty_buffer_flush frees not acquired buffers.
As the result, for example, read of b->size in tty_buffer_free
can return garbage value which will lead to a huge buffer
hanging in the freelist. This is just the benignest
manifestation of freeing of a not acquired object.
If the object is passed to kfree, heap can be corrupted.

Acquire visibility over the buffer before freeing it.

The data race was found with KernelThreadSanitizer (KTSAN).
