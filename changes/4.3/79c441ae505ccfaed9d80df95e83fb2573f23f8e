ppp: implement x-netns support

Let packets move from one netns to the other at PPP encapsulation and
decapsulation time.

PPP units and channels remain in the netns in which they were
originally created. Only the net_device may move to a different
namespace. Cross netns handling is thus transparent to lower PPP
layers (PPPoE, L2TP, etc.).

PPP devices are automatically unregistered when their netns gets
removed. So read() and poll() on the unit file descriptor will
respectively receive EOF and POLLHUP. Channels aren't affected.
