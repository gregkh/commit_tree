irqchip: Appropriate __init annotation for const data

Init data marked const should be annotated with __initconst for
correctness and not __initdata.  And for those already __initconst,
they should be qualified as const at the compiler level too.
This also fixes LTO builds that otherwise fail with section mismatch
errors.
