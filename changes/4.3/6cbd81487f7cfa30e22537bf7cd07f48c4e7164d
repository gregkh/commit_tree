md/raid5: handle possible race as reshape completes.

It is possible (though unlikely) for a reshape to be
interrupted between the time that end_reshape is called
and the time when raid5_finish_reshape is called.

This can leave conf->reshape_progress set to MaxSector,
but mddev->reshape_position not.

This combination confused reshape_request() when ->reshape_backwards.
As conf->reshape_progress is so high, it seems the reshape hasn't
really begun.  But assuming MaxSector is a valid address only
leads to sorrow.

So ensure reshape_position and reshape_progress both agree,
and add an extra check in reshape_request() just in case they don't.
