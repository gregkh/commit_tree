MIPS: scall: Always run the seccomp syscall filters

The MIPS syscall handler code used to return -ENOSYS on invalid
syscalls. Whilst this is expected, it caused problems for seccomp
filters because the said filters never had the change to run since
the code returned -ENOSYS before triggering them. This caused
problems on the chromium testsuite for filters looking for invalid
syscalls. This has now changed and the seccomp filters are always
run even if the syscall is invalid. We return -ENOSYS once we
return from the seccomp filters. Moreover, similar codepaths have
been merged in the process which simplifies somewhat the overall
syscall code.
