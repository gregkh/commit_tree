mmc: sdhci: also get preset value and driver type for MMC_DDR52

commit bb8175a8aa42 ("mmc: sdhci: clarify DDR timing mode between
SD-UHS and eMMC") added MMC_DDR52 as eMMC's DDR mode to be
distinguished from SD-UHS, but it missed setting driver type for
MMC_DDR52 timing mode.

So sometimes we get the following error on Marvell BG2Q DMP board:

[    1.559598] mmcblk0: error -84 transferring data, sector 0, nr 8, cmd
response 0x900, card status 0xb00
[    1.569314] mmcblk0: retrying using single block read
[    1.575676] mmcblk0: error -84 transferring data, sector 2, nr 6, cmd
response 0x900, card status 0x0
[    1.585202] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 2
[    1.591818] mmcblk0: error -84 transferring data, sector 3, nr 5, cmd
response 0x900, card status 0x0
[    1.601341] blk_update_request: I/O error, dev mmcblk0, sector 3

This patches fixes this by adding the missing driver type setting.
