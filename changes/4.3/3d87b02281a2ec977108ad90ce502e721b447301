PM / devfreq: exynos-ppmu: Add the support of PPMUv2 for Exynos5433

This patch adds the support for PPMU (Platform Performance Monitoring Unit)
version 2.0 for Exynos5433 SoC. Exynos5433 SoC must need PPMUv2 which is
quite different from PPMUv1.1. The exynos-ppmu.c driver supports both PPMUv1.1
and PPMUv2.
