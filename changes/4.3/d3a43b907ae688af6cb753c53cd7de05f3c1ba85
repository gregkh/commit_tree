tipc: move link creation from neighbor discoverer to node

As a step towards turning links into node internal entities, we move the
creation of links from the neighbor discovery logics to the node's link
control logics.

We also create an additional entry for the link's media address in the
newly introduced struct tipc_link_entry, since this is where it is
needed in the upcoming commits. The current copy in struct tipc_link
is kept for now, but will be removed later.
