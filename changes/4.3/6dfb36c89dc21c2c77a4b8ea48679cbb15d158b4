iwlwifi: call d3_suspend/resume in d0i3 case as well

Some CSR registers have to be configured also
in case of suspend/resume with unified image
(which doesn't includes reconfiguration flow).

Reuse the existing d3_suspend/d3_resume trans ops,
while making sure some configurations are a bit
different, according to the wowlan type.

After this change, we no longer need the special
wowlan_d0i3 configurations done in iwl_pci_resume,
as they are already being done in the d3_resume op.
