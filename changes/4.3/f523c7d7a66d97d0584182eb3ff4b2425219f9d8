Staging : rtl8188eu : os_dep : Compression of lines for immediate return

This patch compresses two lines into a single line if immediate return is
found. Also remove variable ret as it is no longer needed.
Semantic patch used for this is as follows:

@@
type T;
identifier i,f;
constant C;
@@
- T i;
  ...when != i
     when strict
(
  return -C;
|
- i =
+ return
     f(...);
- return i;
)
