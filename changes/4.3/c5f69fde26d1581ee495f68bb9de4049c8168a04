x86/entry/32: Remove 32-bit syscall audit optimizations

The asm audit optimizations are ugly and obfuscate the code too
much. Remove them.

This will regress performance if syscall auditing is enabled on
32-bit kernels and SYSENTER is in use. If this becomes a
problem, interested parties are encouraged to implement the
equivalent of the 64-bit opportunistic SYSRET optimization.

Alternatively, a case could be made that, on 32-bit kernels, a
less messy asm audit optimization could be done. 32-bit kernels
don't have the complicated partial register saving tricks that
64-bit kernels have, so the SYSENTER post-syscall path could
just call the audit hooks directly.  Any reimplementation of
this ought to demonstrate that it only calls the audit hook once
per syscall, though, which does not currently appear to be true.

Someone would have to make the case that doing so would be
better than implementing opportunistic SYSEXIT, though.
