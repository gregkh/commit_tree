drivers:hv: Modify hv_vmbus to search for all MMIO ranges available.

This patch changes the logic in hv_vmbus to record all of the ranges in the
VM's firmware (BIOS or UEFI) that offer regions of memory-mapped I/O space for
use by paravirtual front-end drivers.  The old logic just found one range
above 4GB and called it good.  This logic will find any ranges above 1MB.

It would have been possible with this patch to just use existing resource
allocation functions, rather than keep track of the entire set of Hyper-V
related MMIO regions in VMBus.  This strategy, however, is not sufficient
when the resource allocator needs to be aware of the constraints of a
Hyper-V virtual machine, which is what happens in the next patch in the series.
So this first patch exists to show the first steps in reworking the MMIO
allocation paths for Hyper-V front-end drivers.
