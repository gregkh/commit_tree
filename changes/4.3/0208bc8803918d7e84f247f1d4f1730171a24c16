Bluetooth: Fix breakage in amp_write_rem_assoc_frag()

We should be passing the pointer itself instead of the address of the
pointer.

This was a copy and paste bug when we replaced the calls to
hci_send_cmd().  Originally, the arguments were "len, cp" but we
overwrote them with "sizeof(cp), &cp" by mistake.
