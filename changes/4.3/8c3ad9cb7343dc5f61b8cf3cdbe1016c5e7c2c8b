nfsd/blocklayout: accept any minlength

Recent Linux clients have started to send GETLAYOUT requests with
minlength less than blocksize.

Servers aren't really allowed to impose this kind of restriction on
layouts; see RFC 5661 section 18.43.3 for details.

This has been observed to cause indefinite hangs on fsx runs on some
clients.
