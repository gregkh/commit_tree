drm/i915: Add cdclk extraction for g33, g965gm and g4x

Implement cdclk extraction for g33, 965gm and g4x platforms. The details
came from configdb. Sadly there isn't anything there for other gen3/gen4
chipsets.

So far I've tested this on one ELK where it gave me a HPLL VCO of 5333
MHz and cdclk of 444 MHz which seems perfectly sane for this machine.
