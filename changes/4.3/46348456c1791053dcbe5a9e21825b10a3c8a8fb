block: Copy a user iovec if it includes gaps

For drivers that don't support gaps in the SG lists handed to
them we must bounce (copy the user buffers) and pass a bio that
does not include gaps. This doesn't matter for any current user,
but will help to allow iser which can't handle gaps to use the
block virtual boundary instead of using driver-local bounce
buffering when handling SG_IO commands.
