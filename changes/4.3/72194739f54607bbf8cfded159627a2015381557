usb: Add device quirk for Logitech PTZ cameras

Add a device quirk for the Logitech PTZ Pro Camera and its sibling the
ConferenceCam CC3000e Camera.
This fixes the failed camera enumeration on some boot, particularly on
machines with fast CPU.

Tested by connecting a Logitech PTZ Pro Camera to a machine with a
Haswell Core i7-4600U CPU @ 2.10GHz, and doing thousands of reboot cycles
while recording the kernel logs and taking camera picture after each boot.
Before the patch, more than 7% of the boots show some enumeration transfer
failures and in a few of them, the kernel is giving up before actually
enumerating the webcam. After the patch, the enumeration has been correct
on every reboot.
