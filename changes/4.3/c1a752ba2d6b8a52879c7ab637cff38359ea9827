tty: don't leak cdev in tty_cdev_add()

Commit a3a10ce3429e ("Avoid usb reset crashes by making tty_io cdevs truly
dynamic") which mixes using cdev_alloc() and cdev_init() is problematic.
Subsequent call to cdev_init() after cdev_alloc() sets kobj release method
from cdev_dynamic_release() to cdev_default_release() and thus makes it
impossible to free allocated cdev.

This patch also consolidates error path of cdev_add() as cdev can also leak
here if things went wrong.
