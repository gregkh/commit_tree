selinux: initialize sock security class to default value

Initialize the security class of sock security structures
to the generic socket class.  This is similar to what is
already done in inode_alloc_security for files.  Generally
the sclass field will later by set by socket_post_create
or sk_clone or sock_graft, but for protocol implementations
that fail to call any of these for newly accepted sockets,
we want some sane default that will yield a legitimate
avc denied message with non-garbage values for class and
permission.
