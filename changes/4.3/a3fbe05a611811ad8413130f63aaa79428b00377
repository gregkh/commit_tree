drm/i915: Don't tag kernel batches as user batches

The render state initialisation code does an explicit i915_add_request() call to
commit the init commands. It was passing in the initialisation batch buffer to
add_request() as the batch object parameter. However, the batch object entry in
the request structure (which is all that parameter is used for) is meant for
keeping track of user generated batch buffers for blame tagging during GPU
hangs.

This patch clears the batch object parameter so that kernel generated batch
buffers are not tagged as being user generated.
