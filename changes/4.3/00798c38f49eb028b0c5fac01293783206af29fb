ipw2100: fix timeout bug - always evaluated to 0

commit 2c86c275015c ("Add ipw2100 wireless driver.") introduced
HW_PHY_OFF_LOOP_DELAY (HZ / 5000) which always evaluated to 0. Clarified
by Stanislav Yakovlev <stas.yakovlev@gmail.com> that it should be 50
milliseconds thus fixed up to msecs_to_jiffies(50).
