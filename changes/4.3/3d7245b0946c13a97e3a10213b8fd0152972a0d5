perf annotate: Fix 32-bit compilation error in util/annotate.c

Fix the following 32-bit compilation errors:

  util/annotate.c: In function ‘addr_map_symbol__account_cycles’:
  util/annotate.c:643:3: error: format ‘%lx’ expects argument of type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 4 has type ‘u64’ [-Werror=format=]
    pr_debug2("BB with bad start: addr %lx start %lx sym %lx saddr %lx\n",
      ^
  util/annotate.c:643:3: error: format ‘%lx’ expects argument of type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 5 has type ‘u64’ [-Werror=format=]
  util/annotate.c:643:3: error: format ‘%lx’ expects argument of type ‘long unsigned int’, but argument 6 has type ‘u64’ [-Werror=format=]

These were introduced by the patch:

"perf report: Add infrastructure for a cycles histogram"

Also change the 'saddr' variable from 'unsigned long' to 'u64'
noting that theoretically we could be processing data captured
on a 64-bit machine but processing it on a 32-bit machine.
