rcu: Deinline rcu_read_lock_sched_held() if DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC

DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC=y is not a production setting, but it is
not very unusual either. Many developers routinely
use kernels built with it enabled.

Apart from being selected by hand, it is also auto-selected by
PROVE_LOCKING "Lock debugging: prove locking correctness" and
LOCK_STAT "Lock usage statistics" config options.
LOCK STAT is necessary for "perf lock" to work.

I wouldn't spend too much time optimizing it, but this particular
function has a very large cost in code size: when it is deinlined,
code size decreases by 830,000 bytes:

    text     data      bss       dec     hex filename
85674192 22294776 20627456 128596424 7aa39c8 vmlinux.before
84837612 22294424 20627456 127759492 79d7484 vmlinux
