x86/traps: Weaken context tracking entry assertions

We were asserting that we were all the way in CONTEXT_KERNEL
when exception handlers were called.  While having this be true
is, I think, a nice goal (or maybe a variant in which we assert
that we're in CONTEXT_KERNEL or some new IRQ context), we're not
quite there.

In particular, if an IRQ interrupts the SYSCALL prologue and the
IRQ handler in turn causes an exception, the exception entry
will be called in RCU IRQ mode but with CONTEXT_USER.

This is okay (nothing goes wrong), but until we fix up the
SYSCALL prologue, we need to avoid warning.
