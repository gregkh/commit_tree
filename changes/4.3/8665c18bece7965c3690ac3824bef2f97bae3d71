phy-sun4i-usb: Add support for monitoring vbus via a power-supply

On some boards there is no vbus_det gpio pin, instead vbus-detection for
otg can be done via the pmic.

This commit adds support for monitoring vbus_det via the power_supply
exported by the pmic, enabling support for otg on these boards.
