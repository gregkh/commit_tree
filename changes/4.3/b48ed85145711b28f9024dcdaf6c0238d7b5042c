DocBook: Generate consistent IDs

By default, DocBook XSL uses a non-deterministic function to generate
IDs for HTML elements where it can't take a name from the input
document.  However, it has the option to generate 'consistent'
(deterministic) IDs instead.  Enable this to make the HTML pages
reproducible.
