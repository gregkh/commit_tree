pinctrl: sun5i: Fix a10s pwm1 pinctrl mapping

The comment for PG14 mux setting 3 already correctly states that this
muxes PG13 to pwm1, but the text ascociated with it said uart3, fix this.

Note that we use "pwm" rather then "pwm1" to be consistent with pwm0
where the mux setting is also simply called "pwm" and to be consistent
with sun4i/sun7i which do the same.
