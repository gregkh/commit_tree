ARM: 8445/1: fix vdsomunge not to depend on glibc specific byteswap.h

If the host toolchain is not glibc based then the arm kernel build
fails with

  HOSTCC  arch/arm/vdso/vdsomunge
  arch/arm/vdso/vdsomunge.c:48:22: fatal error: byteswap.h: No such file or directory

Observed: with omap2plus_defconfig and compile on Mac OS X with arm ELF
cross-compiler.

Reason: byteswap.h is a glibc only header.

Solution: replace by private byte-swapping macros (taken from
arch/mips/boot/elf2ecoff.c and kindly improved by Russell King)

Tested to compile on Mac OS X 10.9.5 host.
