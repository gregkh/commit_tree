ACPICA: Debugger: Add option to display namespace summary/counts

ACPICA commit bba222c15c2ce79076eb3a5e9d4d5f7120db8a00

If "Objects" command is invoked with no arguments, the counts
for each object type are displayed.

Linux kernel is not affected by this commit as currently debugger is
not enabled in the Linux kernel.
