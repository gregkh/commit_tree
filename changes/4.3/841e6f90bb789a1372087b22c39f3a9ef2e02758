pwm: NXP LPC18xx PWM/SCT driver

This commit adds support for NXP LPC18xx PWM/SCT.

NXP LPC SoCs family, which includes LPC18xx/LPC43xx, provides a State
Configurable Timer (SCT) which can be configured as a Pulse Width
Modulator. Other SoCs in that family may share the same hardware.

The PWM supports a total of 16 channels, but only 15 can be simultaneously
requested. There's only one period, global to all the channels, thus PWM
driver will refuse setting different values to it, unless there's only one
channel requested.
