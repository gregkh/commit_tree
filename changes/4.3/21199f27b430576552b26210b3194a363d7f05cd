locking/lockdep: Fix hlock->pin_count reset on lock stack rebuilds

Various people reported hitting the "unpinning an unpinned lock"
warning. As it turns out there are 2 places where we take a lock out
of the middle of a stack, and in those cases it would fail to preserve
the pin_count when rebuilding the lock stack.
