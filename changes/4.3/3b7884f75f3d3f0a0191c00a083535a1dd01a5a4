ixgbe: Don't report flow director filter's status

For two reasons I want to disable this:
1. Not any part actually check the report status(Alexander Duyck)
2. To report hash value of a packet to stack,
   RSS -> 32bits hash value
   Perfect match fdir filter -> 13bits hash value
   Hashed-based fdir filter -> 31bits hash value

   fdir filter might hash on masked tuples for IP address,
   so it's still not desirable for usage.

So for now, just stick to RSS 32bits hash value.
