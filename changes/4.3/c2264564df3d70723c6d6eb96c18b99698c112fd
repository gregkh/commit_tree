kconfig: warn of unhandled characters in Kconfig commands

In Kconfig, definitions of options take the following form:
"<COMMAND> <PARAM> <PARAM> ...". COMMANDs and PARAMs are treated
slightly different by the underlying parser.

While commit 2e0d737fc76f ("kconfig: don't silently ignore unhandled
characters") introduced a warning for unsupported characters around
PARAMs, it does not cover situations where a COMMAND has additional
characters before it.

This change makes Kconfig emit a warning if superfluous characters
are found before COMMANDs. As the 'help' statement sometimes is
written as '---help---', the '-' character would now also be regarded
as unhandled and generate a warning. To avoid that, '-' is added to
the list of allowed characters, and the token '---help---' is included
in the zconf.gperf file.
