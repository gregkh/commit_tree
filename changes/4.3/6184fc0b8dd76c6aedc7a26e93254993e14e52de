quota: Propagate error from ->acquire_dquot()

Currently when some error happened in ->acquire_dquot(), dqget() just
returned NULL. That was indistinguishable from a case when e.g. someone
run quotaoff and so was generally silently ignored. However
->acquire_dquot() can fail because of ENOSPC or EIO in which case user
should better know. So propagate error up from ->acquire_dquot properly.
