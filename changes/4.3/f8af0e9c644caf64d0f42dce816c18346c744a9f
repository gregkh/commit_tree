clocksource/drivers/pistachio: Prevent ftrace recursion

Currently pistachio can be used as a scheduler clock. We properly marked
pistachio_read_sched_clock() as notrace but we then call another function
pistachio_clocksource_read_cycles() that _wasn't_ notrace.

Having a traceable function in the sched_clock() path leads to a recursion
within ftrace and a kernel crash.

Fix this by adding notrace attribute to the pistachio_clocksource_read_cycles()
function.
