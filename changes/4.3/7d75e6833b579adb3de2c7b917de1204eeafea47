ring-buffer: Make sure event has enough room for extend and padding

Now that events only add time extends after it is committed, in case
an event comes in before it can discard the allocated event, the time
extend needs to be stored within the event. If the event is bigger
than then size needed for the time extend, padding must be added.
The minimum padding size is 8 bytes. Thus if the event is 12 bytes
(size of time extend + 4), there will not be enough room to add both
the time extend and padding. Make sure all events are either 8 bytes
or 16 or more bytes.
