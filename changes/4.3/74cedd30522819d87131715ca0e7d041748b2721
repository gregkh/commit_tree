i2c: return probe deferred status on dev_pm_domain_attach

A change of return status was introduced in commit 3fffd1283927
("i2c: allow specifying separate wakeup interrupt in device tree")

The commit prevents the defer status being passed up the call stack
appropriately when dev_pm_domain_attach returns -EPROBE_DEFER.

Catch the PROBE_DEFER and clear up the IRQ wakeup status
