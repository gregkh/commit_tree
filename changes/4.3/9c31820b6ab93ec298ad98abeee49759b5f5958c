target: Remove cmd->se_ordered_id (unused except debug log lines)

For every command, we set se_ordered_id by doing atomic_inc_return on
dev->dev_ordered_id for the corresponding device.  However, the only
places this value gets used are in pr_debug() calls, which doesn't
seem worth an extra atomic op per IO.
