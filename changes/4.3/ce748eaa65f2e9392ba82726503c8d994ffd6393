xfs: create new metadata UUID field and incompat flag

This adds a new superblock field, sb_meta_uuid.  If set, along with
a new incompat flag, the code will use that field on a V5 filesystem
to compare to metadata UUIDs, which allows us to change the user-
visible UUID at will.  Userspace handles the setting and clearing
of the incompat flag as appropriate, as the UUID gets changed; i.e.
setting the user-visible UUID back to the original UUID (as stored in
the new field) will remove the incompatible feature flag.

If the incompat flag is not set, this copies the user-visible UUID into
into the meta_uuid slot in memory when the superblock is read from disk;
the meta_uuid field is not written back to disk in this case.

The remainder of this patch simply switches verifiers, initializers,
etc to use the new sb_meta_uuid field.
