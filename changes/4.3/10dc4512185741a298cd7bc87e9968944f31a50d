svcrdma: Clean up svc_rdma_get_reply_array()

Kernel coding conventions frown upon having large nontrivial
functions in header files, and the preference these days is to
allow the compiler to make inlining decisions if possible.

As these functions are re-homed into a .c file, be sure that
comparisons with fields in struct rpcrdma_msg are with be32
constants.

This is a refactoring change; no behavior change is intended.
