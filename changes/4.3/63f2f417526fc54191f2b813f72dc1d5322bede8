[media] gscpa_m5602: use msecs_to_jiffies for conversions

API compliance scanning with coccinelle flagged:
./drivers/media/usb/gspca/m5602/m5602_s5k83a.c:180:9-25:
	 WARNING: timeout (100) seems HZ dependent

Numeric constants passed to schedule_timeout() make the effective
timeout HZ dependent which makes little sense in a polling loop for
the cameras rotation state.
Fixed up by converting the constant to jiffies with msecs_to_jiffies()
