drm/msm: Set different display size limitation on each target

The maximum output width of one pipeline depends on the LayerMixer's
capability. It may be different on each target. Also, MDP5 doesn't
have vertical limitation in one frame, as long as the pixel clock
can be supported.

This change obtains the maximum LM resolution from configuration
table and treat it as the whole pipe's limitation for MDP5. The size
limit on MDP4 is not changed.
