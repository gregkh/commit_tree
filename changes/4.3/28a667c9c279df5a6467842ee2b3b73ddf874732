Bluetooth: advertisement handling in new connect procedure

Currently, when trying to connect to already paired device that just
rotated its RPA MAC address, old address would be used and connection
would fail. In order to fix that, kernel must scan and receive
advertisement with fresh RPA before connecting.

This path makes sure that after advertisement is received from device that
we try to connect to, it is properly handled in check_pending_le_conn and
trigger connect attempt.

It also modifies hci_le_connect to make sure that connect attempt will be
properly continued.
