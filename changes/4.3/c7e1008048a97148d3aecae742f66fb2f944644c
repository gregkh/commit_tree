ALSA: hda - Disable power_save_node for IDT 92HD73xx chips

The recent widget power saving introduced some unavoidable click
noises on old IDT 92HD73xx chips while it still seems working on the
compatible new chips.  In the bugzilla, we tried lots of tests and
workarounds, but they didn't help much.  So, let's disable the feature
for these specific chips as the least (but safest) fix.
