sched/fair: Beef up wake_wide()

Josef Bacik reported that Facebook sees better performance with their
1:N load (1 dispatch/node, N workers/node) when carrying an old patch
to try very hard to wake to an idle CPU.  While looking at wake_wide(),
I noticed that it doesn't pay attention to the wakeup of a many partner
waker, returning 1 only when waking one of its many partners.

Correct that, letting explicit domain flags override the heuristic.

While at it, adjust task_struct bits, we don't need a 64-bit counter.
