iio:accel:bmc150-accel: Use the chip ID to detect sensor variant

Instead of using the I2C or ACPI ID to determine which variant of
the chipset to use, determine that from the chip ID.

Under Windows, the same driver is used for those variants and, despite
incorrect ACPI data, it is able to load and operate the accelerometer.

Fixes the accelerometer failing with:
bmc150_accel i2c-BMA250E:00: Invalid chip f8
on the WinBook TW100
