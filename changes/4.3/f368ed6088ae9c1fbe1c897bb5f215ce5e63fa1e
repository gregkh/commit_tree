char: make misc_deregister a void function

With well over 200+ users of this api, there are a mere 12 users that
actually checked the return value of this function.  And all of them
really didn't do anything with that information as the system or module
was shutting down no matter what.

So stop pretending like it matters, and just return void from
misc_deregister().  If something goes wrong in the call, you will get a
WARNING splat in the syslog so you know how to fix up your driver.
Other than that, there's nothing that can go wrong.
