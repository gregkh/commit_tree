IB/srp: Re-enable FMR for non-page aligned buffers

During a discussion in 2011 nobody recalled why FMR was not used for
non-page aligned buffers (see also
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.drivers.rdma/7149). Re-enable FMR
for such buffers. For the reason why the srp_map_fmr() function needs
to be modified, see also patch "IB/srp: rework mapping engine to use
multiple FMR entries" (commit ID 8f26c9ff9cd0; January 2011).
