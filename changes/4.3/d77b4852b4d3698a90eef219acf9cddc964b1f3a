mac802154: add llsec address update workaround

This patch adds a workaround for using the new nl802154 netlink
interface with the old ieee802154 netlink interface togehter. The
nl802154 currently supports no access for llsec layer, currently there
are users outside which are using both interfaces at the same time. This
patch adds a necessary call when addresses are updated.
