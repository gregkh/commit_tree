tcp: use dctcp if enabled on the route to the initiator

Currently, the following case doesn't use DCTCP, even if it should:
A responder has f.e. Cubic as system wide default, but for a specific
route to the initiating host, DCTCP is being set in RTAX_CC_ALGO. The
initiating host then uses DCTCP as congestion control, but since the
initiator sets ECT(0), tcp_ecn_create_request() doesn't set ecn_ok,
and we have to fall back to Reno after 3WHS completes.

We were thinking on how to solve this in a minimal, non-intrusive
way without bloating tcp_ecn_create_request() needlessly: lets cache
the CA ecn option flag in RTAX_FEATURES. In other words, when ECT(0)
is set on the SYN packet, set ecn_ok=1 iff route RTAX_FEATURES
contains the unexposed (internal-only) DST_FEATURE_ECN_CA. This allows
to only do a single metric feature lookup inside tcp_ecn_create_request().

Joint work with Florian Westphal.
