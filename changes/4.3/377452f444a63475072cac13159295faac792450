MAINTAINERS: Add Device Tree binding doc for max77686 regulator

The Device Tree binding documentation for the Maxim max77686 regulators
has been moved from the Multi-Function Device DT binding section to its
own Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/max77686.txt file.

Use a wilcard so both the mfd and regulator DT bindings are resolved.
