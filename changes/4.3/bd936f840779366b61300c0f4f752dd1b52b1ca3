f2fs: cleanup write_orphan_inodes

Previously, since 'commit 4531929e3922 ("f2fs: move grabing orphan
pages out of protection region")' was committed, in write_orphan_inodes(),
we will grab all meta page in a batch before we use them under spinlock,
so that we can avoid large time delay of grabbing meta pages under
spinlock.

Now, 'commit d6c67a4fee86 ("f2fs: revmove spin_lock for
write_orphan_inodes")' remove the spinlock in write_orphan_inodes,
so there is no issue we describe above, we'd better recover to move
the grab operation to original place for readability.
