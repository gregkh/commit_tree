Serial: imx: add dev_pm_ops to support suspend to ram/disk

When system goes into low power states like SUSPEND_MEM and
HIBERNATION, the hardware IP block may be powered off to reduce
the power consumption. This power down may cause problems on
some imx platforms, because the hardware settings are reset to
its power on default values which may differ from the ones when
it power off. This patch added the dev_pm_ops and implemented
two callbacks: suspend_noirq and resume_noirq, which will save
the necessory hardware parameters right before power down and
recover them before system uses the hardware.

Because added the dev_pm_ops, the old suspend/resume callbacks
under platform_driver will not be called any more. Changed their
prototypes and moved those two callbacks into dev_pm_ops too.
