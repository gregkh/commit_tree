ebpf: remove self-assignment in interpreter's tail call

ARG1 = BPF_R1 as it stands, evaluates to regs[BPF_REG_1] = regs[BPF_REG_1]
and thus has no effect. Add a comment instead, explaining what happens and
why it's okay to just remove it. Since from user space side, a tail call is
invoked as a pseudo helper function via bpf_tail_call_proto, the verifier
checks the arguments just like with any other helper function and makes
sure that the first argument (regs[BPF_REG_1])'s type is ARG_PTR_TO_CTX.
