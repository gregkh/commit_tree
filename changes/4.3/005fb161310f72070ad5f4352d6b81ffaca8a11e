ath10k: Improve performance by reducing tx_lock contention

During tx completion, tx_lock is held for longer than required, preventing
efficient refill of htt->pending_tx. Refactor the code so that only MSDU
related operations are protected by the lock.

Improves downstream performance on a dual-core ARM Freescale LS1024A
(f.k.a. Mindspeed Comcerto 2000) AP with a 3x3 client from 495 to 580 Mbps.
Other CPU bound multicore systems may also benefit.
