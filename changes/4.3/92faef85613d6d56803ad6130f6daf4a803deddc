i40e: Set defport behavior for the Main VSI when in promiscuous mode

This fixes bugs where the port is not receiving multicast or VLAN tagged
packets when in promiscuous mode. This can occur when a SW bridge is
created on top of the device.

This also fixes issues where the promiscuous behavior setting was not
being preserved across a reset caused by features being enabled or
disabled.

We are using defport instead of doing a true promiscuous mode because we do
not need to receive the SRIOV or VMDq VSI directed traffic which would suck
up bandwidth and is really not intended for the SW bridge.

In addition, with defport we get VLAN promiscuous behavior which is not
possible from the VSI level promiscuous setting.
