USB: io_ti: Increase insufficient timeout for firmware downloads

The io_ti driver fails to download firmware to Edgeport devices such as
the EP/416 and EP/421 (devices with on-board E2PROM).  One of the problems
is that the default 1 second timeout in ti_vsend_sync() is insufficient
for download operations.  This patch increases the download timeout to
10 seconds.
