clocksource: Fix abs() usage w/ 64bit values

This patch fixes one cases where abs() was being used with 64-bit
nanosecond values, where the result may be capped at 32-bits.

This potentially could cause watchdog false negatives on 32-bit
systems, so this patch addresses the issue by using abs64().
