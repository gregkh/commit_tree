cpufreq: governor: Avoid invalid states with additional checks

There can be races where the request has come to a wrong state. For
example INIT followed by STOP (instead of START) or START followed by
EXIT (instead of STOP).

Address these races by making sure the state-machine never gets into
any invalid state. Also return an error if an invalid state-transition
is requested.
