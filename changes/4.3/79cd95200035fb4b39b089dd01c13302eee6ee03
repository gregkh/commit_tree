powerpc/eeh: Dump PHB diag-data for non-existing PE

When detecting EEH error on non-existing PE, including the reserved
one, the PE is simply unfrozen without dumping the PHB diag-data,
which is useful for locating the root cause of the EEH error. The
patch dumps the PHB diag-data when non-existing PE reports error.
