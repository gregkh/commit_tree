[media] c8sectpfe: fix pinctrl dependencies

compiling on some archs fail with:

drivers/media/platform/sti/c8sectpfe/c8sectpfe-core.c:540:8: error: implicit declaration of function ‘pinctrl_select_state’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  ret = pinctrl_select_state(fei->pinctrl, tsin->pstate);

That's due the need of including pinctrl.h header and because
CONFIG_PINCTRL needs to be true.
