perf/x86/intel/lbr: Add support for LBRv5

Add support for the new LBRv5 format used on Intel Skylake CPUs.

The flags for mispredict, abort, in_tx etc. moved to range of separate
LBR_INFO_* MSRs. Teach the LBR code to read those. The original
LBR registers stay the same, except they have full sign
extension now.

LBR_INFO also reports a cycle count to the last branch.
Report the cycle information using the new "cycles" branch_info
output field.

In addition we have to context switch and clear the new INFO
MSRs to avoid any information leaks.
