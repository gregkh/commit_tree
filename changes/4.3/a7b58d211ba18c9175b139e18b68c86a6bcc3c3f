perf/x86/intel/lbr: Allow time stamp for free running PEBSv3

With PEBSv3 the PEBS record contains a time stamp. That means we can allow
free-running PEBS without a PMI even if the user program requested a time stamp.
This avoids the need to use -T to get free running PEBS, and also avoids
any problems with mis-identifying MMAPs later.

Move the free_running_flags state into a variable in x86_pmu and use it.
This only works when no explicit clock_id is set.
