drm/i915: Move cdclk and pll setup to intel_modeset_compute_config(), v2.

It makes more sense there, since these are computation steps that can
fail.

Changes since v1:
- Rename __intel_set_mode_checks to intel_modeset_checks (Matt Roper)
- Move intel_modeset_checks to before check_planes, so it won't
  have to be moved later.
