regmap: Apply optional delay in multi_reg_write/register_patch

Add an optional delay_us field in reg_sequence to allow the client to
specify a delay (in microseconds) to be applied after any given write
in a sequence of writes.

We treat a delay in a sequence the same way we treat a page change as
they are logically similar in that you can coalesce all write before
a delay (in the same way you can coalesce all writes before a page
change is needed)
