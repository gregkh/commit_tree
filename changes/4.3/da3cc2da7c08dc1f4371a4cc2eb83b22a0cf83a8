bnx2: Fix bandwidth allocation for some MF modes

Management firmware tells driver in case bandwidth configuration for
a specific function exists, but [regretably] the same field has different
meanings depending on the multi-function mode - it can either be
a percentile value or an actual speed.

For newer multi-function modes current logic is incorrect -
driver understands values as actual speeds instead of percentages,
causing the resulting chip configuration to be incorrect.
