drm/exynos: use drm atomic state directly

For some fields the use of struct exynos_drm_plane filled with data from
the plane state just creates a source of duplicated information and
overhead.  Here we change the crtc drivers to access the plane state
directly simplifying the code by not relying on a exynos internal struct.
