RDMA/iser: Limit sgs to the device fastreg depth

Currently the sg tablesize, which dictates fast register page list
depth to use, does not take into account the limits of the rdma device.
So adjust it once we discover the device fastreg max depth limit.  Also
adjust the max_sectors based on the resulting sg tablesize.
