ACPI / bus: Move duplicate code to a separate new function

After merging commit 712e960f0ee9 (ACPI / PM: Attach ACPI power
domain only once) with commit 1dcc3d3362b0 (ACPI / bus: Move ACPI
bus type registration) there is some duplicate code in
acpi_device_is_first_physical_node() and acpi_companion_match()
that can be moved to a separate routine and called from both
places.
