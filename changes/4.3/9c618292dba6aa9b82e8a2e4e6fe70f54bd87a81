mtd: nand: sunxi: Replace failsafe timing cfg with calculated value

The TIMING_CFG register was previously statically set to a magic value
(extracted from Allwinner's BSP) when initializing the NAND controller.
Now that we have more details about the TIMING_CFG register layout
(extracted from the A83 user manual) we can dynamically calculate the
appropriate value for each NAND chip and set it when selecting the
chip.
