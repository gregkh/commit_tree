powerpc: Use orig_gpr3 in syscall_get_arguments()

Currently syscall_get_arguments() is used by syscall tracepoints, and
collect_syscall() which is used in some debugging as well as
/proc/pid/syscall.

The current implementation just copies regs->gpr[3 .. 5] out, which is
fine for all the current use cases.

When we enable seccomp filter, that will also start using
syscall_get_arguments(). However for seccomp filter we want to use r3
as the return value of the syscall, and orig_gpr3 as the first
parameter. This will allow seccomp to modify the return value in r3.

To support this we need to modify syscall_get_arguments() to return
orig_gpr3 instead of r3. This is safe for all uses because orig_gpr3
always contains the r3 value that was passed to the syscall. We store it
in the syscall entry path and never modify it.

Update syscall_set_arguments() while we're here, even though it's never
used.
