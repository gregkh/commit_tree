ARM: dts: Fix bootup thermal issue on smdk5250

With default config on smdk5250 latest tree throws below message:

[    2.226049] thermal thermal_zone0: critical temperature reached(224 C),shutting down
[    2.227840] reboot: Failed to start orderly shutdown: forcing the issue

and hangs randomly because it reads wrong temperature value.

I can't figure out any direct relation between LDO10 and TMU from board
schematics which I have. So making LDO10 always-on to fix issue for now.
