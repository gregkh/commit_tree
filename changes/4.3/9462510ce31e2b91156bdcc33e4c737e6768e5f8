pinctrl: tegra: Only set the gpio range if needed

If the gpio DT node has the gpio-ranges property, the range will be
added by the gpio core and doesn't need to be added by the pinctrl
driver.

By having the gpio-ranges property, we have an explicit dependency from
the gpio node to the pinctrl node and we can stop using the deprecated
pinctrl_add_gpio_range() function.
