perf tools: Validate config term maximum value

Currently the value of a PMU config term is silently truncated if it is
too big. This is an impediment to validating the value for other
criteria later on i.e.  the user provides an invalid value that gets
truncated to a valid one.

The maximum value validation is only done for the parser where the error
is passed back to the user. In other cases the silent truncation
continues so as not to affect tools that perhaps rely on it.
