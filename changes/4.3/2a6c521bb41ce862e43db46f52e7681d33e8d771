drm/nouveau/gem: return only valid domain when there's only one

On nv50+, we restrict the valid domains to just the one where the buffer
was originally created. However after the buffer is evicted to system
memory, we might move it back to a different domain that was not
originally valid. When sharing the buffer and retrieving its GEM_INFO
data, we still want the domain that will be valid for this buffer in a
pushbuf, not the one where it currently happens to be.

This resolves fdo#92504 and several others. These are due to suspend
evicting all buffers, making it more likely that they temporarily end up
in the wrong place.
