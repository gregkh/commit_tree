KVM: add halt_attempted_poll to VCPU stats

This new statistic can help diagnosing VCPUs that, for any reason,
trigger bad behavior of halt_poll_ns autotuning.

For example, say halt_poll_ns = 480000, and wakeups are spaced exactly
like 479us, 481us, 479us, 481us. Then KVM always fails polling and wastes
10+20+40+80+160+320+480 = 1110 microseconds out of every
479+481+479+481+479+481+479 = 3359 microseconds. The VCPU then
is consuming about 30% more CPU than it would use without
polling.  This would show as an abnormally high number of
attempted polling compared to the successful polls.
