mei: bus: enable running fixup routines before device registration

Split the device registration into allocation and device struct
initialization, device setup, and the final device registration.
This why it is possible to run fixups and quirks during the setup stage
on an initialized device. Each fixup routine effects do_match flag.
If the flag is set to false at the end the device won't be
registered on the bus.
