crypto: ccp - Provide support to autoload CCP driver

Add the necessary module device tables to the platform support to allow
for autoloading of the CCP driver. This will allow for the CCP's hwrng
support to be available without having to manually load the driver. The
module device table entry for the pci support is already present.
