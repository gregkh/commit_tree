arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Check for !irqchip_in_kernel() when mapping resources

Until b26e5fdac43c ("arm/arm64: KVM: introduce per-VM ops"),
kvm_vgic_map_resources() used to include a check on irqchip_in_kernel(),
and vgic_v2_map_resources() still has it.

But now vm_ops are not initialized until we call kvm_vgic_create().
Therefore kvm_vgic_map_resources() can being called without a VGIC,
and we die because vm_ops.map_resources is NULL.

Fixing this restores QEMU's kernel-irqchip=off option to a working state,
allowing to use GIC emulation in userspace.
