clk: tegra: Add functions for parsing CVB tables

Tegra CVB tables encode the relationship between operating voltage
and optimal frequency as a function of the so-called speedo value.
The speedo value is written to the on-chip fuses at the factory,
which allows the voltage-frequency operating points to be calculated
on an per-chip basis.

Add utility functions to parse the Tegra-specific tables and export the
voltage-frequency pairs to the generic OPP framework for other drivers
to use.
