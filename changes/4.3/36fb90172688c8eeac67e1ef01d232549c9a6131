iwlwifi: mvm: add the ability to trigger only monitor dumps

Change the FW debug trigger tlv to include a monitor only
option. Setting this option to true will cause fw dump triggers
to only collect monitor data and skip other dumps such as
SMEM, SRAM, CSR, PRPH, etc.
This option is used when accessing the different parts of the
firmware memory is not wanted and can cause unwanted behavior
like when debugging TX latency.
