of_mdio: add new DT property 'managed' to specify the PHY management type

Currently the PHY management type is selected by the MAC driver arbitrary.
The decision is based on the presence of the "fixed-link" node and on a
will of the driver's authors.
This caused a regression recently, when mvneta driver suddenly started
to use the in-band status for auto-negotiation on fixed links.
It appears the auto-negotiation may not work when expected by the MAC driver.
Sebastien Rannou explains:
<< Yes, I confirm that my HW does not generate an in-band status. AFAIK, it's
a PHY that aggregates 4xSGMIIs to 1xQSGMII ; the MAC side of the PHY (with
inband status) is connected to the switch through QSGMII, and in this context
we are on the media side of the PHY. >>

This patch introduces the new string property 'managed' that allows
the user to set the management type explicitly.
The supported values are:
"auto" - default. Uses either MDIO or nothing, depending on the presence
of the fixed-link node
"in-band-status" - use in-band status
