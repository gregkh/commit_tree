x86/kconfig/32: Rename CONFIG_VM86 and default it to 'n'

VM86 is entirely broken if ptrace, syscall auditing, or
NOHZ_FULL is in use.  The code is a big undocumented mess, it's
a real PITA to test, and it looks like a big chunk of vm86_32.c
is dead code.  It also plays awful games with the entry asm.

No one should be using it anyway. Use DOSBOX or KVM instead.

Let's accelerate its slow death.  Remove it from EXPERT and
default it to n.  Distros should not enable it.  In the unlikely
event that some user needs it, they can easily re-enable it.

While we're at it, rename it to CONFIG_X86_LEGACY_VM86 so that 'make
oldconfig' users will be prompted again.  I left CONFIG_VM86 as
an alias to avoid a treewide replacement of the names.  We can
clean that up once the current asm and vm86 code churn settles
down.
