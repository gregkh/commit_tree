arm64: enable more compressed Image formats

Plumb up Makefile arguments for the already supported formats in the kbuild
system: lz4, bzip2, lzma, and lzo.

Note that just as with Image.gz, these images are not self-decompressing and
the booting firmware still needs to handle decompression before launching the
kernel image.
