staging: speakup: fix speakup-r regression

Here is a patch to make speakup-r work again.

It broke in 3.6 due to commit 4369c64c79a22b98d3b7eff9d089196cd878a10a
"Input: Send events one packet at a time)

The problem was that the fakekey.c routine to fake a down arrow no
longer functioned properly and putting the input_sync fixed it.
