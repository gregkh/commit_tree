perf tools: Add Intel PT support for PSB periods

The PSB packet is a synchronization packet that provides a starting
point for decoding or recovery from errors.

This patch adds support for a new Intel PT feature that allows the
frequency of PSB packets to be specified.

Support for this feature is indicated by
/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/psb_cyc which contains "1"
if the feature is supported and "0" otherwise.

The PSB period can be specified as a PMU config term e.g. perf record -e
intel_pt/psb_period=2/u sleep 1

The default value is 3 or the nearest lower value that is supported.  0
is always supported.

Valid values are given by:

/sys/bus/event_source/devices/intel_pt/caps/psb_periods

which contains a hexadecimal value, the bits of which represent valid
values e.g. bit 2 set means value 2 is valid.

The value is converted to the approximate number of trace bytes between
PSB packets as:

	2 ^ (value + 11)

e.g. value 3 means 16KiB bytes between PSBs

If an invalid value is entered, the error message will give a list of
valid values e.g.

	$ perf record -e intel_pt/psb_period=15/u uname
	Invalid psb_period for intel_pt. Valid values are: 0-5

tools/perf/Documentation/intel-pt.txt is updated in a later patch as
there are a number of new features being added.

For more information about PSB periods refer to the Intel 64 and IA-32
Architectures SDM Chapter 36 Intel Processor Trace from June 2015 or
later.
