IB/ipoib: Return IPoIB devices matching connection parameters

Implement the get_net_device_by_port_pkey_ip callback that returns network
device to ib_core according to connection parameters. Check the ipoib
device and iterate over all child devices to look for a match.

For each IPoIB device we iterate through all upper devices when searching
for a matching IP, in order to support bonding.
