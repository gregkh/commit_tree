xprtrdma: take HCA driver refcount at client

This is a rework of the following patch sent almost a year back:
http://www.mail-archive.com/linux-rdma%40vger.kernel.org/msg20730.html

In presence of active mount if someone tries to rmmod vendor-driver, the
command remains stuck forever waiting for destruction of all rdma-cm-id.
in worst case client can crash during shutdown with active mounts.

The existing code assumes that ia->ri_id->device cannot change during
the lifetime of a transport. xprtrdma do not have support for
DEVICE_REMOVAL event either. Lifting that assumption and adding support
for DEVICE_REMOVAL event is a long chain of work, and is in plan.

The community decided that preventing the hang right now is more
important than waiting for architectural changes.

Thus, this patch introduces a temporary workaround to acquire HCA driver
module reference count during the mount of a nfs-rdma mount point.
