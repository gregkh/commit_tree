    drm/crtc_helper: Replace open-coded CRTC state helpers

error handling code was broken, resulting in the first path not being
checked correctly. Fix this by using the same pattern as in the
transitional plane helper function drm_plane_helper_update.

v2: Simplify the cleanup code while at it too.

v3: After some debugging with John we realized that the above patch
from Daniel also accidentally removed the if (crtc_state) check. This
is legal when transitioning to atomic, when the initial state reset
isn't all wired up yet properly. Reinstate that check to fix the bug
John has hit.
