clk: tegra: Add Tegra124 DFLL clocksource platform driver

Add basic platform driver support for the fast CPU cluster DFLL
clocksource found on Tegra124 SoCs. This small driver selects the
appropriate Tegra124-specific characterization data and integration
code. It relies on the DFLL common code to do most of the work.
