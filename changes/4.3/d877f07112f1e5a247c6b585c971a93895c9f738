netfilter: nf_tables: add nft_dup expression

This new expression uses the nf_dup engine to clone packets to a given gateway.
Unlike xt_TEE, we use an index to indicate output interface which should be
fine at this stage.

Moreover, change to the preemtion-safe this_cpu_read(nf_skb_duplicated) from
nf_dup_ipv{4,6} to silence a lockdep splat.

Based on the original tee expression from Arturo Borrero Gonzalez, although
this patch has diverted quite a bit from this initial effort due to the
change to support maps.
