scsi_dh: move device matching to the core code

Add a single list of devices that need non-ALUA device handlers to the core
scsi_dh code so that we can autoload the modules for them at probe time.

While this is a little ugly in terms of architecture it actually
significantly simplifies the code in addition to the new autoloading
functionality.
