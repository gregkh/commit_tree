mac80211: enable assoc check for mesh interfaces

We already set a station to be associated when peering completes, both
in user space and in the kernel.  Thus we should always have an
associated sta before sending data frames to that station.

Failure to check assoc state can cause crashes in the lower-level driver
due to transmitting unicast data frames before driver sta structures
(e.g. ampdu state in ath9k) are initialized.  This occurred when
forwarding in the presence of fixed mesh paths: frames were transmitted
to stations with whom we hadn't yet completed peering.
