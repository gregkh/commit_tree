usb: phy: phy-generic: Fix reset behaviour on legacy boot

The gpio-desc migration done in v4.0 caused a regression
with legacy boots due to reversed reset logic.
e.g. omap3-beagle USB host breaks on legacy boot.

Request the reset GPIO with GPIOF_ACTIVE_LOW flag so that
it matches the driver logic and pin behaviour.
