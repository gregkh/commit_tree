ACPICA: Dispatcher: Add trace support for interpreter

ACPICA commit 71299ec8b49054daace0df50268e8e055654ca37

This patch adds trace point at the following point:
 1. Begin/end of a control method execution;
 2. Begin/end of an opcode execution.

The trace point feature can be enabled by defining ACPI_DEBUG_OUTPUT
and specifying a debug level that includes ACPI_LV_TRACDE_POINT and the
debug layers that include ACPI_PARSER and ACPI_DISPACTCHER.

In order to make aml_op_name of union acpi_parse_object usable for tracer, it is
enabled for ACPI_DEBUG_OUTPUT in this patch. Lv Zheng.
