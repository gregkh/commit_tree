i2c: core: Add support for best effort block read emulation

There are devices that need to handle block transactions
regardless of the capabilities exported by the adapter.
For performance reasons, they need to use i2c read blocks
if available, otherwise emulate the block transaction with word
or byte transactions.

Add support for a helper function that would read a data block
using the best transfer available: I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_I2C_BLOCK,
I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_WORD_DATA or I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_READ_BYTE_DATA.
