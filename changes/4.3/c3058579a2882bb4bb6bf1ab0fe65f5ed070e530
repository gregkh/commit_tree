drm/exynos: remove buf_cnt from struct exynos_drm_fb

Looking other drm drivers, there is no the restriction that framebuffer
has only one buffer in .create_handle() callback. They use just first
buffer.

If this limitation is removed, there is no reason keeping buffer count
for framebuffer, so we can remove buf_cnt from struct exynos_drm_fb.
