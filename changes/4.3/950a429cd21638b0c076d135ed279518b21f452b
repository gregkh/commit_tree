ACPICA: Parser: Cleanup aml_offset in union acpi_operand_object

ACPICA commit 61b360074fde2bb8282722579410f5d1fb12f84d

This patch converts aml_offset in union acpi_operand_object to AML address.

AML offset is actually only used by the debugger, using AML address is more
direct and efficient during the parsing stage so that we don't need to
calculate the offset during the parsing stage and will not have
difficulities in converting it into other offset attributes.

Sometimes, aml_offset is not an indication of the offset from the table
header but the offset from the entry of a list of terms, which requires
additional efforts to convert it into an offset from the table header. By
using AML address directly, there is no such difficulty.
Thus this patch also deletes a logic in disassembler that is trying to
convert the aml_offset from
  "offset from the start address of Method/Package/Buffer"
into the
  "offset from the start address of the ACPI table"
(Sample code deletion can be seen in acpi_dm_deferred_parse(), but the
function is not in the Linux kernel). Lv Zheng.
