x86/pci/intel_mid_pci: Work around for IRQ0 assignment

On Intel Tangier the MMC host controller is wired up to irq 0. But
several other devices have irq 0 associated as well due to a bogus PCI
configuration.

The first initialized driver will acquire irq 0 and make it
unavailable for other devices. If the sdhci driver is not the first
one it will fail to acquire the interrupt and therefor be non
functional.

Add a quirk to the pci irq enable function which denies irq 0 to
anything else than the MMC host controller driver on Tangier
platforms.
