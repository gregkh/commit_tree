xen: remove no longer needed p2m.h

Cleanup by removing arch/x86/xen/p2m.h as it isn't needed any more.

Most definitions in this file are used in p2m.c only. Move those into
p2m.c.

set_phys_range_identity() is already declared in
arch/x86/include/asm/xen/page.h, add __init annotation there.

MAX_REMAP_RANGES isn't used at all, just delete it.

The only define left is P2M_PER_PAGE which is moved to page.h as well.
