ext4: replace ext4_io_submit->io_op with ->io_wbc

ext4_io_submit_init() takes the pointer to writeback_control to test
its sync_mode and determine between WRITE and WRITE_SYNC and records
the result in ->io_op.  This patch makes it record the pointer
directly and moves the test to ext4_io_submit().

This doesn't cause any noticeable differences now but having
writeback_control available throughout IO submission path will be
depended upon by the planned cgroup writeback support.
