cpufreq: Separate CPU device registration from CPU online

To separate the CPU online interface from the CPU device
registration, split cpufreq_online() out of cpufreq_add_dev()
and make cpufreq_cpu_callback() call the former, while
cpufreq_add_dev() itself will only be used as the CPU device
addition subsystem interface callback.
