[media] dvb-frontends: Make all DVB Frontends visible if COMPILE_TEST=y

Make the DVB Frontends menu visible when compile-testing, to allow
selecting additional drivers on top of the drivers that are already
automatically selected if MEDIA_SUBDRV_AUTOSELECT is enabled.

Without this, many drivers stay disabled during e.g. allmodconfig.
