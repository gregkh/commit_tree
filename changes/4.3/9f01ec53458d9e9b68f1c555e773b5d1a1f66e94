Drivers: hv: vmbus: Improve the CPU affiliation for channels

The current code tracks the assigned CPUs within a NUMA node in the context of
the primary channel. So, if we have a VM with a single NUMA node with 8 VCPUs, we may
end up unevenly distributing the channel load. Fix the issue by tracking affiliations
globally.
