md/raid5: switch to use conf->chunk_sectors in place of mddev->chunk_sectors where possible

The chunk_sectors and new_chunk_sectors fields of mddev can be changed
any time (via sysfs) that the reconfig mutex can be taken.  So raid5
keeps internal copies in 'conf' which are stable except for a short
locked moment when reshape stops/starts.

So any access that does not hold reconfig_mutex should use the 'conf'
values, not the 'mddev' values.
Several don't.

This could result in corruption if new values were written at awkward
times.

Also use min() or max() rather than open-coding.
