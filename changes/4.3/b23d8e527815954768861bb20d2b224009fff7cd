x86/apic: Migrate apic timer to new set_state interface

Migrate apic driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

We weren't doing anything while switching to resume mode and so that
callback isn't implemented.
