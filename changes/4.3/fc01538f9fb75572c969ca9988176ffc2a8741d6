inet: simplify timewait refcounting

timewait sockets have a complex refcounting logic.
Once we realize it should be similar to established and
syn_recv sockets, we can use sk_nulls_del_node_init_rcu()
and remove inet_twsk_unhash()

In particular, deferred inet_twsk_put() added in commit
13475a30b66cd ("tcp: connect() race with timewait reuse")
looks unecessary : When removing a timewait socket from
ehash or bhash, caller must own a reference on the socket
anyway.
