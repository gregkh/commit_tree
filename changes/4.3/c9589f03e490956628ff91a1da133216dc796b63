blk-throttle: improve queue bypass handling

If a queue is bypassing, all blkcg policies should become noops but
blk-throttle wasn't.  It only became noop if the queue was dying.
While this wouldn't lead to an oops as falling back to the root blkg
is safe in this case, this can be a bit surprising - a bypassing queue
could still be applying throttle limits.

Fix it by removing blk_queue_dying() test in throtl_lookup_create_tg()
and testing blk_queue_bypass() in blk_throtl_bio() and bypassing
before doing anything else.
