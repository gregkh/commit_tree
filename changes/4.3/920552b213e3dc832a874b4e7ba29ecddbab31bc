KVM: disable halt_poll_ns as default for s390x

We observed some performance degradation on s390x with dynamic
halt polling. Until we can provide a proper fix, let's enable
halt_poll_ns as default only for supported architectures.

Architectures are now free to set their own halt_poll_ns
default value.
