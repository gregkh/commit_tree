staging: comedi: usbduxsigma: round down AI scan_begin_arg at step 4.

The return value of the `cmdtest` handler for a subdevice checks the
prospective new command in various steps and returns the step number at
which any problem was detected, or 0 if no problem was detected.  It is
allowed to modify the command in various ways at each step.  Corrections
for out-of-range values are generally made at step 3, and minor
adjustments such as rounding are generally made at step 4.

The `cmdtest` handler for the AI subdevice (`usbduxsigma_ai_cmdtest()`)
currently modifies `cmd->scan_begin_arg` to bring it into range and
round it down at step 3.  Move the rounding down part to step 4 to
follow the usual Comedi convention.
