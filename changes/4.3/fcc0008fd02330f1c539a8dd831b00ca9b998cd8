drm/i915: Bump CHV PFI credits to 63 when cdclk>=czclk

Switch from using 31 PFI credits to 63 PFI credits when cdclk>=czclk on
CHV. The spec lists both 31 and 63 as "suggested" values, but based on
feedback from hardware folks we should actually be using 63. Originally
I picked the 31 basically by flipping a coin.
