net: thunderx: Rework interrupt handling

Rework interrupt handler to avoid checking IRQ affinity of
CQ interrupts. Now separate handlers are registered for each IRQ
including RBDR. Register interrupt handlers for only those
which are being used. Add nicvf_dump_intr_status() and use it
in irq handlers.
