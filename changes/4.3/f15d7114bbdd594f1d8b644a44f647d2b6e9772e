Documentation/watchdog: add timeout and ping rate control to watchdog-test.c

The watchdog test program is much more useful if it can configure the
timeout value and ping rate.  This will allow you to test actual timeouts.

Adds the -t parameter to set the timeout value (in seconds), and -p to set
the ping rate (number of seconds between pings).
