checkpatch: add some <foo>_destroy functions to NEEDLESS_IF tests

Sergey Senozhatsky has modified several destroy functions that can
now be called with NULL values.

 - kmem_cache_destroy()
 - mempool_destroy()
 - dma_pool_destroy()

Update checkpatch to warn when those functions are preceded by an if.

Update checkpatch to --fix all the calls too only when the code style
form is using leading tabs.

from:
	if (foo)
		<func>(foo);
to:
	<func>(foo);
