dmaengine: sirf: clear pending DMA interrupt when DMA terminates

If DMA interrupt comes and is latched by IRQ controller during the
execution of dma_terminate_all(), dma_irq routine will be executed
after dma terminated, and it will cause kernel panic.
We clear DMA interrupts in dma_terminate_all() to avoid this useless
interrupt.
