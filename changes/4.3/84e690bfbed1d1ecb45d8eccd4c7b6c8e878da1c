KVM: arm64: introduce vcpu->arch.debug_ptr

This introduces a level of indirection for the debug registers. Instead
of using the sys_regs[] directly we store registers in a structure in
the vcpu. The new kvm_arm_reset_debug_ptr() sets the debug ptr to the
guest context.

Because we no longer give the sys_regs offset for the sys_reg_desc->reg
field, but instead the index into a debug-specific struct we need to
add a number of additional trap functions for each register. Also as the
generic generic user-space access code no longer works we have
introduced a new pair of function pointers to the sys_reg_desc structure
to override the generic code when needed.
