sched/numa: Fix NUMA_DIRECT topology identification

Systems which have all nodes at a distance of at most 1 hop should be
identified as 'NUMA_DIRECT'.

However, the scheduler incorrectly identifies it as 'NUMA_BACKPLANE'.
This is because 'n' is assigned to sched_max_numa_distance but the
code (mis)interprets it to mean 'number of hops'.

Rik had actually used sched_domains_numa_levels for detecting a
'NUMA_DIRECT' topology:

But that was changed when he removed the hops table in the
subsequent version:

Fixing the issue here.
