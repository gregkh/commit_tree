KVM: arm64: guest debug, define API headers

This commit defines the API headers for guest debugging. There are two
architecture specific debug structures:

  - kvm_guest_debug_arch, allows us to pass in HW debug registers
  - kvm_debug_exit_arch, signals exception and possible faulting address

The type of debugging being used is controlled by the architecture
specific control bits of the kvm_guest_debug->control flags in the ioctl
structure.
