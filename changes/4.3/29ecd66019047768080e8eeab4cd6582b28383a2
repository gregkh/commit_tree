KVM: x86: avoid uninitialized variable warning

This does not show up on all compiler versions, so it sneaked into the
first 4.3 pull request.  The fix is to mimic the logic of the "print
sptes" loop in the "fill array" loop.  Then leaf and root can be
both initialized unconditionally.

Note that "leaf" now points to the first unused element of the array,
not the last filled element.
