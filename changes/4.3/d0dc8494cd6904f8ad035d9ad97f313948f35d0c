perf/x86/intel/pebs: Add PEBS frontend profiling for Skylake

Skylake has a new FRONTEND_LATENCY PEBS event to accurately profile
frontend problems (like ITLB or decoding issues).

The new event is configured through a separate MSR, which selects
a range of sub events.

Define the extra MSR as a extra reg and export support for it
through sysfs.  To avoid duplicating the existing
tables use a new function to add new entries to existing tables.
