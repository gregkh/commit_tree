blkcg: refine error codes returned during blkcg configuration

blkcg currently returns -EINVAL for most errors which can be pretty
confusing given that the failure modes are quite varied.  Update the
error returns so that

* -EINVAL only for syntactic errors.
* -ERANGE if the value is out of range.
* -ENODEV if the target device can't be found.
* -EOPNOTSUPP if the policy is not enabled on the target device.
