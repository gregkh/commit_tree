be2net: make the RX_FILTER command asynchronous

This fix makes the RX_FILTER cmd asynchronous, i.e., the caller issues
this cmd and doesn't wait for a completion from the FW. If the FW/adapter
is in an error state, this change helps in not holding up the rtnl_lock
and keeping bottom halves disabled while the driver timesout waiting for
a response from the FW.
