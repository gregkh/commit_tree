Staging: most: add MOST driver's aim-v4l2 module

This patch adds the aim-v4l2 module of the MOST driver to the kernel's
driver staging area. This module is part of the MOST driver and handles
user space interaction by means of V4L2.

This patch is needed in order to have access to MOST isochronous AVP data
through V4L2 devices.
