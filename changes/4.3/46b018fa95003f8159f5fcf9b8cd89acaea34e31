Input: walkera0701 - fix abs() calculations on 64 bit values

abs() function can not be used with 64 bit values, so let's switch to
abs64(). From include/linux/kernel.h:

/*
 * abs() handles unsigned and signed longs, ints, shorts and chars.
 * For all input types abs() returns a signed long.
 * abs() should not be used for 64-bit types (s64, u64, long long)
 * - use abs64() for those.
