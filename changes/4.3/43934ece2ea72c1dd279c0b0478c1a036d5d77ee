mmc: core: Don't return an error for CD/WP GPIOs when GPIOLIB is unset

When CONFIG_GPIOLIB is unset, its stubs will return -ENOSYS. That means
when the mmc core parses DT for CD/WP GPIOs via mmc_of_parse(), -ENOSYS
becomes propagated to the caller. Typically this means that the mmc host
driver fails to probe.

As the CD/WP GPIOs are already treated as optional, let's extend that to
cover the case when CONFIG_GPIOLIB is unset.
