pm80xx: Fix for Incorrect DMA Unmapping of SG List

In pm8001_ccb_task_free(), the dma unmapping is done based on
ccb->n_elem value. This should be initialized to zero in the
task_abort(). Otherwise, pm8001_ccb_task_free() will try for
dma_unmap_sg() which is invalid for task abort and can lead to
kernel crash.

Changes From V1:
None
