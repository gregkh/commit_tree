serial: imx: reduce irq-latency after rx overflow

To prevent problems with interrupt latency, and due to the fact, that
the error will be counted anyway (icount.overrun), the dev_err is simply
removed.

Background:
If an rx-fifo overflow occurs a dev_err message was called in interrupt
context. Since dev_err messages are written to console in a synchronous way
(unbuffered), and console may be a serial terminal, this leads to a
highly increased interrupt-latency (several milliseconds).
As a result of the high latency more rx-fifo overflows will happen, and
therefore a feedback loop of errors is created.
