gpio: em: Remove obsolete platform data support

Since commit 59032702ead90562 ("ARM: shmobile: Remove legacy platform
devices from EMEV2 SoC code"), EMMA Mobile SoCs are only supported in
generic DT-only ARM multi-platform builds.  The driver doesn't need to
use platform data anymore, hence remove platform data configuration.
