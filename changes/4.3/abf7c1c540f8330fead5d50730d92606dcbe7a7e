lwtunnel: set skb protocol and dev

In the locally-generated packet path skb->protocol may not be set and
this is required for the lwtunnel encap in order to get the lwtstate.

This would otherwise have been set by ip_output or ip6_output so set
skb->protocol prior to calling the lwtunnel encap
function. Additionally set skb->dev in case it is needed further down
the transmit path.
