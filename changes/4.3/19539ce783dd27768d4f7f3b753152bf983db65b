ebpf: emit correct src_reg for conditional jumps

Instead of always emitting BPF_REG_X, let's emit BPF_REG_X only when the
source actually is BPF_X. This causes programs generated by the classic
converter to not be importable via bpf(), as the eBPF verifier checks that
the src_reg is correct or 0. While not a problem yet, this will be a
problem when BPF_PROG_DUMP lands, and we can potentially dump and re-import
programs generated by the converter.
