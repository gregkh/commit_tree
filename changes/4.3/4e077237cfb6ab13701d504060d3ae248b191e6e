xfrm: Fix state threshold configuration from userspace

Allow to change the replay threshold (XFRMA_REPLAY_THRESH) and expiry
timer (XFRMA_ETIMER_THRESH) of a state without having to set other
attributes like replay counter and byte lifetime. Changing these other
values while traffic flows will break the state.
