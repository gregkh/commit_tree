dax: fix O_DIRECT I/O to the last block of a blockdev

commit bbab37ddc20b (block: Add support for DAX reads/writes to
block devices) caused a regression in mkfs.xfs.  That utility
sets the block size of the device to the logical block size
using the BLKBSZSET ioctl, and then issues a single sector read
from the last sector of the device.  This results in the dax_io
code trying to do a page-sized read from 512 bytes from the end
of the device.  The result is -ERANGE being returned to userspace.

The fix is to align the block to the page size before calling
get_block.

Thanks to willy for simplifying my original patch.
