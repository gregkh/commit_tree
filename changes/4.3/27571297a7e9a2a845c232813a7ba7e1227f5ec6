pNFS: Tighten up locking around DS commit buckets

I'm not aware of any bugreports around this issue, but the locking
around the pnfs_commit_bucket is inconsistent at best. This patch
tightens it up by ensuring that the 'bucket->committing' list is always
changed atomically w.r.t. the 'bucket->clseg' layout segment tracking.
