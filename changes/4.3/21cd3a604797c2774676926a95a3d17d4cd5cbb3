kmemleak: record accurate early log buffer count and report when exceeded

In log_early function, crt_early_log should also count once when
'crt_early_log >= ARRAY_SIZE(early_log)'.  Otherwise the reported count
from kmemleak_init is one less than 'actual number'.

Then, in kmemleak_init, if early_log buffer size equal actual number,
kmemleak will init sucessful, so change warning condition to
'crt_early_log > ARRAY_SIZE(early_log)'.
