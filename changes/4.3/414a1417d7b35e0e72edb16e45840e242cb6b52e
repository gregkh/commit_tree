coresight-etm3x: Change the name of the ctxid_val to ctxid_pid

'ctxid_val' array was used to store the value of ETM context ID comparator
which actually stores the process ID to be traced, so using 'ctxid_pid' as
its name instead make it easier to understand.

This patch also changes the ABI, it is normally not allowed, but
fortunately it is a testing ABI and very new for now. Nevertheless,
if you don't think it should be changed, we could always add an alias
for userspace.
