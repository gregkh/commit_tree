net/ipv6: add sysctl option accept_ra_min_hop_limit

Commit 6fd99094de2b ("ipv6: Don't reduce hop limit for an interface")
disabled accept hop limit from RA if it is smaller than the current hop
limit for security stuff. But this behavior kind of break the RFC definition.

RFC 4861, 6.3.4.  Processing Received Router Advertisements
   A Router Advertisement field (e.g., Cur Hop Limit, Reachable Time,
   and Retrans Timer) may contain a value denoting that it is
   unspecified.  In such cases, the parameter should be ignored and the
   host should continue using whatever value it is already using.

   If the received Cur Hop Limit value is non-zero, the host SHOULD set
   its CurHopLimit variable to the received value.

So add sysctl option accept_ra_min_hop_limit to let user choose the minimum
hop limit value they can accept from RA. And set default to 1 to meet RFC
standards.
