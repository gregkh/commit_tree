blkcg: move root blkg lookup optimization from throtl_lookup_tg() to __blkg_lookup()

Currently, both throttle and cfq policies implement their own root
blkg (blkcg_gq) lookup fast path.  This patch moves root blkg
optimization from throtl_lookup_tg() to __blkg_lookup().  cfq-iosched
currently doesn't use blkg_lookup() but will be converted and drop the
optimization too.
