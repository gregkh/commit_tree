cpufreq: acpi-cpufreq: Drop acpi_data from struct acpi_cpufreq_data

After commit 8cfcfd39000d (acpi-cpufreq: Fix an ACPI perf unregister
issue) we store both a pointer to per-CPU data of the first policy
CPU and the number of that CPU which are redundant.

Since the CPU number has to be stored anyway for the unregistration,
the pointer to the CPU's per-CPU data may be dropped and we can
access the data in question via per_cpu_ptr().
