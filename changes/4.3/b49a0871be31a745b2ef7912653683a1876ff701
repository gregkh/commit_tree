block: remove split code in blkdev_issue_{discard,write_same}

The split code in blkdev_issue_{discard,write_same} can go away
now that any driver that cares does the split. We have to make
sure bio size doesn't overflow.

For discard, we set max discard sectors to (1<<31)>>9 to ensure
it doesn't overflow bi_size and hopefully it is of the proper
granularity as long as the granularity is a power of two.
