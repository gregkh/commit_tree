drm/i915: Convert connector checking to atomic, v3.

Right now dpms callbacks can still fiddle with the connector state,
but it can only turn connectors off.

This is remediated by only checking crtc->state->active when the
connector is active, and ignore crtc->state->active when the
connector is off.

connectors_active is no longer checked, and will be removed later
in this series together with dpms.

Another check for !encoder->crtc is performed by check_encoder_state
too, so it can be removed.

Changes since v1:
- Add commit message.
- rename state to old_state.
- Move deletion of mst_port check to mst patch.
Changes since v2:
- Fix a null pointer dereference on MST now hw readout is fixed.
