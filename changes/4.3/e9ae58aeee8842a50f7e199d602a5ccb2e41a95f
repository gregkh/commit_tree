NFS: nfs_set_pgio_error sometimes misses errors

We should ensure that we always set the pgio_header's error field
if a READ or WRITE RPC call returns an error. The current code depends
on 'hdr->good_bytes' always being initialised to a large value, which
is not always done correctly by callers.
When this happens, applications may end up missing important errors.
