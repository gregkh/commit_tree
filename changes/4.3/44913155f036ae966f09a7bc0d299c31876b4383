drm/i915: Store max cdclk value in dev_priv

Keep the cdclk maximum supported frequency around in dev_priv so that we
can verify certain things against it before actually changing the cdclk
frequency.

For now only VLV/CHV have support changing cdclk frequency, so other
plarforms get to assume cdclk is fixed.

v2: Rebased to the latest
v3: Rebased to the latest
v4: Fix for patch style problems
