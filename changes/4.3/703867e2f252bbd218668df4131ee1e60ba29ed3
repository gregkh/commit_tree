ALSA: hda - Fix Dell laptop for internal mic/headset mic

The new Dell laptop with ALC3266 can't use internal microphone to
record. Also, the 3 ring headset mic doesn't work on it. For src of
patch_realtek.c, only the pin cfg of Nid 0x17 is different, so the
Nid 0x17 is added into pin quirk, and others are defined to macro
ALC298_STANDARD_PINS in common use.

Codec: Realtek ALC3266
