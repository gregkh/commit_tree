test_bpf: assign type to native eBPF test cases

As JITs start to perform optimizations whether to clear A and X on eBPF
programs in the prologue, we should actually assign a program type to the
native eBPF test cases. It doesn't really matter which program type, as
these instructions don't go through the verifier, but it needs to be a
type != BPF_PROG_TYPE_UNSPEC. This reflects eBPF programs loaded via bpf(2)
system call (!= type unspec) vs. classic BPF to eBPF migrations (== type
unspec).
