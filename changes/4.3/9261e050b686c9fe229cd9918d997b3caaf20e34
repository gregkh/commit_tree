x86/asm/tsc, x86/paravirt: Remove read_tsc() and read_tscp() paravirt hooks

We've had ->read_tsc() and ->read_tscp() paravirt hooks since
the very beginning of paravirt, i.e.,

  d3561b7fa0fb ("[PATCH] paravirt: header and stubs for paravirtualisation").

AFAICT, the only paravirt guest implementation that ever
replaced these calls was vmware, and it's gone. Arguably even
vmware shouldn't have hooked RDTSC -- we fully support systems
that don't have a TSC at all, so there's no point for a paravirt
implementation to pretend that we have a TSC but to replace it.

I also doubt that these hooks actually worked. Calls to rdtscl()
and rdtscll(), which respected the hooks, were used seemingly
interchangeably with native_read_tsc(), which did not.

Just remove them. If anyone ever needs them again, they can try
to make a case for why they need them.

Before, on a paravirt config:
  text    	data     bss     dec     hex filename
  12618257      1816384 1093632 15528273 ecf151 vmlinux

After:
  text		data     bss     dec     hex filename
  12617207      1816384 1093632 15527223 eced37 vmlinux
