Drivers: hv_vmbus: Fix signal to host condition

Fixes a bug where previously hv_ringbuffer_read would pass in the old
number of bytes available to read instead of the expected old read index
when calculating when to signal to the host that the ringbuffer is empty.
Since the previous write size is already saved, also changes the
hv_need_to_signal_on_read to use the previously read value rather than
recalculating it.
