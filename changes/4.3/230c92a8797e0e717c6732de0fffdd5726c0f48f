userfaultfd: propagate the full address in THP faults

The THP faults were not propagating the original fault address.  The
latest version of the API with uffd.arg.pagefault.address is supposed to
propagate the full address through THP faults.

This was not a kernel crashing bug and it wouldn't risk to corrupt user
memory, but it would cause a SIGBUS failure because the wrong page was
being copied.

For various reasons this wasn't easily reproducible in the qemu workload,
but the strestest exposed the problem immediately.
