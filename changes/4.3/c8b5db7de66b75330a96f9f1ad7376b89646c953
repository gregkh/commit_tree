x86/hpet: Migrate to new set_state interface

Migrate hpet driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

Forward definition of 'hpet_clockevent' wasn't required and so it is
placed after all the callback are defined, to avoid forward declaring
all the callbacks.
