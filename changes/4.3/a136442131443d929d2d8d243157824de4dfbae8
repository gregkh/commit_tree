phy: fix of_mdio_find_bus() device refcount leak

of_mdio_find_bus() leaks a struct device refcount, caused by using
class_find_device() and not realising that the device reference has
its refcount incremented:

 * Note, you will need to drop the reference with put_device() after use.
...
        while ((dev = class_dev_iter_next(&iter))) {
                if (match(dev, data)) {
                        get_device(dev);
                        break;
                }

Update the comment, and arrange for the phy code to drop this refcount
when disposing of a reference to it.
