bnx2x: Add vxlan RSS support

Latest FW submission added some vxlan offload capabilities to our device.
This patch adds the ability to connect to the vxlan NDOs and configure
the UDP port associated with it in the HW.

The device would now be capable of performing RSS according to the
inner headers of the vxlan packets.
