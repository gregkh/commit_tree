serial: 8250_omap: workaround module disable errata on dra7x SoCs

Due to Advisory 21 as documented in AM437x errata document,
UART module cannot be disabled once DMA is used. The only
workaround is to softreset the module before disabling it.

DRA7x UARTs are compatible to AM437x UARTs in terms of
this errata and prescribed workaround.

Enable usage of workaround for this errata on DRA7x SoCs.
