clk: tegra: Introduce ability for SoC-specific reset control callbacks

This patch allows SoC-specific CAR initialization routines to register
their own reset_assert and reset_deassert callbacks with the common Tegra
CAR code. If defined, the common code will call these callbacks when a
reset control with number >= num_periph_banks * 32 is attempted to be asserted
or deasserted respectively. Numbers greater than or equal to num_periph_banks * 32
are used to avoid clashes with low numbers that are automatically mapped to
standard CAR reset lines.

Each SoC with these special resets should specify the defined reset control
numbers in a device tree header file.
