drm/i915/skl: enable DDI-E hotplug

v2: fix one error found by checkpath.pl
v3: Add one ignored break for switch-case. DDI-E hotplug
    function doesn't work after updating drm-intel tree,
    I checked the code and found this missing which isn't
    the root cause for broke DDI-E hp.  The broken
    DDI-E hp function is fixed by "Adding DDI_E power
    well domain".
