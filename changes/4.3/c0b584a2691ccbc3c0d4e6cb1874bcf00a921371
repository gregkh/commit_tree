MIPS: mips-cm: Extend CM accessors for 64-bit CPUs

Previously, the CM accessors were only accessing CM registers as u32
types instead of using the native CM register with. However, newer CMs
may actually be 64-bit on MIPS64 cores. Fortunately, current 64-bit CMs
(CM3) hold all the useful configuration bits in the lower half of the
64-bit registers (at least most of them) so they can still be accessed
using the current 32-bit accessors.
