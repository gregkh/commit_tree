drm/nouveau/pm/gf100: add compute signals/sources

These signals and sources have been reverse engineered from CUPTI
(Linux). Graphics signals exposed by PerfKit (Windows only) will be
added later. I need to reverse engineer them and it's a bit painful.

This commit also adds a new class for GF108 and GF117.
