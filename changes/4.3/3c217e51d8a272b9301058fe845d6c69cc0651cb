rtc: cmos: century support

If century field is supported by the RTC CMOS device, then we should use
it and then do not consider years greater that 169 as an error.

For information, the year field of the rtc_time structure contains the
value to add to 1970 to obtain the current year.

This was a hack to be able to support years for 1970 to 2069.
This patch remains compatible with this implementation.
