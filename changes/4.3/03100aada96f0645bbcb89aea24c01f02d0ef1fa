block: Replace SG_GAPS with new queue limits mask

The SG_GAPS queue flag caused checks for bio vector alignment against
PAGE_SIZE, but the device may have different constraints. This patch
adds a queue limits so a driver with such constraints can set to allow
requests that would have been unnecessarily split. The new gaps check
takes the request_queue as a parameter to simplify the logic around
invoking this function.

This new limit makes the queue flag redundant, so removing it and
all usage. Device-mappers will inherit the correct settings through
blk_stack_limits().
