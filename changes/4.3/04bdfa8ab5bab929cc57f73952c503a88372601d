arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Move active state handling to flush_hwstate

We currently set the physical active state only when we *inject* a new
pending virtual interrupt, but this is actually not correct, because we
could have been preempted and run something else on the system that
resets the active state to clear.  This causes us to run the VM with the
timer set to fire, but without setting the physical active state.

The solution is to always check the LR configurations, and we if have a
mapped interrupt in the LR in either the pending or active state
(virtual), then set the physical active state.
