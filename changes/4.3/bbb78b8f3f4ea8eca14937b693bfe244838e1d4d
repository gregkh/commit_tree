kexec: align crash_notes allocation to make it be inside one physical page

People reported that crash_notes in /proc/vmcore were corrupted and this
cause crash kdump failure.  With code debugging and log we got the root
cause.  This is because percpu variable crash_notes are allocated in 2
vmalloc pages.  Currently percpu is based on vmalloc by default.  Vmalloc
can't guarantee 2 continuous vmalloc pages are also on 2 continuous
physical pages.  So when 1st kernel exports the starting address and size
of crash_notes through sysfs like below:

/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpux/crash_notes
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpux/crash_notes_size

kdump kernel use them to get the content of crash_notes.  However the 2nd
part may not be in the next neighbouring physical page as we expected if
crash_notes are allocated accross 2 vmalloc pages.  That's why
nhdr_ptr->n_namesz or nhdr_ptr->n_descsz could be very huge in
update_note_header_size_elf64() and cause note header merging failure or
some warnings.

In this patch change to call __alloc_percpu() to passed in the align value
by rounding crash_notes_size up to the nearest power of two.  This makes
sure the crash_notes is allocated inside one physical page since
sizeof(note_buf_t) in all ARCHS is smaller than PAGE_SIZE.  Meanwhile add
a BUILD_BUG_ON to break compile if size is bigger than PAGE_SIZE since
crash_notes definitely will be in 2 pages.  That need be avoided, and need
be reported if it's unavoidable.
