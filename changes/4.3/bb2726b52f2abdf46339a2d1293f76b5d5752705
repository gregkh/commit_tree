Revert "mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: use regulator_is_enabled to find pbias status"

This reverts commit c55d7a0553643a7e8f120688b82b594471084d3c.

Without reverting this commit we get "unbalanced disables for pbias_mmc_omap4"
errors on omap4430. It seems that 4430 and 4460 behave in a different way for
the PBIAS regulator registers and until that has been debugged further we
cannot rely on the regulator status registers in hardare on 4430.

devm_regulator_get_optional() for vmmc")
