clk: shmobile: Add CPG/MSTP Clock Domain support

Add Clock Domain support to the Clock Pulse Generator (CPG) Module Stop
(MSTP) Clocks driver using the generic PM Domain.  This allows to
power-manage the module clocks of SoC devices that are part of the
CPG/MSTP Clock Domain using Runtime PM, or for system suspend/resume.

SoC devices that are part of the CPG/MSTP Clock Domain and can be
power-managed through an MSTP clock should be tagged in DT with a
proper "power-domains" property.

The CPG/MSTP Clock Domain code will scan such devices for clocks that
are suitable for power-managing the device, by looking for a clock that
is compatible with "renesas,cpg-mstp-clocks".
