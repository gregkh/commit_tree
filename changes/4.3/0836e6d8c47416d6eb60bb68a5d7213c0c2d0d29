drm/i915: Move sprite/cursor plane disable to intel_sanitize_crtc()

Move the sprite/cursor plane disabling to occur in intel_sanitize_crtc()
where it belongs instead of doing it in intel_modeset_readout_hw_state().

The plane disabling was first added in
4cf0ebbd4fafbdf8e6431dbb315e5511c3efdc3b drm/i915: Rework plane readout.

I got the idea from some patches from Partik and/or Maarten but those
moved also the plane state readout to intel_sanitize_crtc() which isn't
quite right in my opinion.
