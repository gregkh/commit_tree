ARM: 8398/1: arm DMA: Fix allocation from CMA for coherent DMA

This patch allows the use of CMA for DMA coherent memory allocation.
At the moment if the input parameter "is_coherent" is set to true
the allocation is not made using the CMA, which I think is not the
desired behaviour.
The patch covers the allocation and free of memory for coherent
DMA.
