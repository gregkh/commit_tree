dlm: fix connection stealing if using SCTP

When using SCTP and accepting a new connection, DLM currently validates
if the peer trying to connect to it is one of the cluster nodes, but it
doesn't check if it already has a connection to it or not.

If it already had a connection, it will be overwritten, and the new one
will be used for writes, possibly causing the node to leave the cluster
due to communication breakage.

Still, one could DoS the node by attempting N connections and keeping
them open.

As said, but being explicit, both situations are only triggerable from
other cluster nodes, but are doable with only user-level perms.
