ACPICA: Debugger: Reduce structure size for debugger

ACPICA commit 310e0ae1c4730f4dadc80125125099ab76851499

arg_types in struct acpi_db_method_info is only referenced by ACPI_DEBUGGER.

This patch only affects ACPICA debugger which is only used by a non-kernel
tool - acpiexec, so Linux kernel is currently not affected by this patch.
