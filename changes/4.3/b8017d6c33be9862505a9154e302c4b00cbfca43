drm/fb_helper: Add drm_fb_helper functions to manage fb_info creation

Every drm driver calls framebuffer_alloc, fb_alloc_cmap,
unregister_framebuffer, fb_dealloc_cmap and framebuffer_release in
order to emulate fbdev support.

Create drm_fb_helper functions that perform the above operations.

This is part of an effort to prevent drm drivers from calling fbdev
functions directly. It also removes repetitive code from drivers.

There are some drivers that call alloc_apertures after framebuffer_alloc
and some that don't. Make the helper always call alloc_apertures. This
would make certain drivers allocate memory for apertures but not use
them. Since it's a small amount of memory, it shouldn't be an issue.

v2:
- Added kerneldocs
- Added a check for non-NULL fb_helper before proceeding. This will
  make the helpers work when we have a module param for fbdev emulation
