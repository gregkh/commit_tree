rcu: Panic if RCU tree can not accommodate all CPUs

Currently a condition when RCU tree is unable to accommodate
the configured number of CPUs is not permitted and causes
a fall back to compile-time values. However, the code has no
means to exceed the RCU tree capacity neither at compile-time
nor in run-time. Therefore, if the condition is met in run-
time then it indicates a serios problem elsewhere and should
be handled with a panic.
