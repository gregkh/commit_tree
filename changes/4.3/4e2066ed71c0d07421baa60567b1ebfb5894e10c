ARM: dts: sun8i: Enable USB DRC on GA10H-A33 tablets

Enable the otg controller on GA10H-A33 tablets, for now it is enabled
in host-only mode, because true OTG support requires support for
detecting and enabling Vbus through the axp221 pmic.

For this to work the Vbus on the port must be enabled by u-boot,
or a powered hub must be used.
