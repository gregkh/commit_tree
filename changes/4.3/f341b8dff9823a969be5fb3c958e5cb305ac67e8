s390/vtime: limit MT scaling value updates

The MT scaling values are updated on each calll to do_account_vtime.
This function is called for each HZ interrupt and for each context
switch. Context switch can happen often, the STCCTM instruction
on this path is noticeable. Limit the updates to once per jiffy.
