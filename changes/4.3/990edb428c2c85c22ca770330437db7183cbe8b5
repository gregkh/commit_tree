ipv6: Re-arrange code in rt6_probe()

It is a prep work for the next patch to remove write_lock
from rt6_probe().

1. Reduce the number of if(neigh) check.  From 4 to 1.
2. Bring the write_(un)lock() closer to the operations that the
   lock is protecting.

Hopefully, the above make rt6_probe() more readable.
