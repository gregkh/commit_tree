ARM: OMAP2: Delete an unnecessary check

The of_node_put() function tests whether its argument is NULL and then
returns immediately if so.  Furthermore, the kerneldoc for
of_node_put() explicitly supports passing in a NULL pointer as its
argument.  Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
