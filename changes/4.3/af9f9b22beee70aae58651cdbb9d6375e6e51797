mac80211: don't store napi struct

When introducing multiple RX queues, a single NAPI struct will not
be sufficient. Instead of trying to store multiple, simply change
the API to have the NAPI struct passed to the RX function. This of
course means that drivers using rx_irqsafe() cannot use NAPI, but
that seems a reasonable trade-off, particularly since only two of
all drivers are currently using it at all.

While at it, we can now remove the IEEE80211_RX_REORDER_TIMER flag
again since this code path cannot have a napi struct anyway.
