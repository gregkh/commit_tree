PCI: Set MPS to match upstream bridge

Firmware typically configures the PCIe fabric with a consistent Max Payload
Size setting based on the devices present at boot.  A hot-added device
typically has the power-on default MPS setting (128 bytes), which may not
match the fabric.

The previous Linux default, in the absence of any "pci=pcie_bus_*" options,
was PCIE_BUS_TUNE_OFF, in which we never touch MPS, even for hot-added
devices.

Add a new default setting, PCIE_BUS_DEFAULT, in which we make sure every
device's MPS setting matches the upstream bridge.  This makes it more
likely that a hot-added device will work in a system with optimized MPS
configuration.

Note that if we hot-add a device that only supports 128-byte MPS, it still
likely won't work because we don't reconfigure the rest of the fabric.
Booting with "pci=pcie_bus_peer2peer" is a workaround for this because it
sets MPS to 128 for everything.
