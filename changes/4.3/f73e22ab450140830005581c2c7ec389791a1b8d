perf: Fix races in computing the header sizes

There are two races with the current code:

 - Another event can join the group and compute a larger header_size
   concurrently, if the smaller store wins we'll have an incorrect
   header_size set.

 - We compute the header_size after the event becomes active,
   therefore its possible to use the size before its computed.

Remedy the first by moving the computation inside the ctx::mutex lock,
and the second by placing it _before_ perf_install_in_context().
