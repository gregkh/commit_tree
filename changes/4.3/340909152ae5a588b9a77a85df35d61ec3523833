bpf tools: Record map accessing instructions for each program

This patch records the indices of instructions which are needed to be
relocated. That information is saved in the 'reloc_desc' field in
'struct bpf_program'. In the loading phase (this patch takes effect in
the opening phase), the collected instructions will be replaced by map
loading instructions.

Since we are going to close the ELF file and clear all data at the end
of the 'opening' phase, the ELF information will no longer be valid in
the 'loading' phase. We have to locate the instructions before maps are
loaded, instead of directly modifying the instruction.

'struct bpf_map_def' is introduced in this patch to let us know how many
maps are defined in the object.

This is the third part of map relocation. The principle of map relocation
is described in commit message of 'bpf tools: Collect symbol table from
SHT_SYMTAB section'.
