net: mdio-octeon: Drop obsolete Kconfig advice

"Y" was the right answer for MDIO_OCTEON when this option was only
available on CAVIUM_OCTEON_SOC. But now that the option is visible on
all (64-bit) systems, this piece of advice no longer makes sense. This
helper module is selected automatically by drivers which need it
anyway.
