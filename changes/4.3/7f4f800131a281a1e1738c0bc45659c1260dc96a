perf trace: Move vfs_getname storage to per thread area

We were storing the vfs_getname payload (i.e. ptr->string) into
the trace wide storage area (struct trace), so that we could use the
last payload when setting up the fd->pathname per thread tables, oops,
not a good idea for multi cpu tracing sessions...

Fix it by moving it to the per thread area (struct thread_trace).
