blkcg: move body parsing from blkg_conf_prep() to its callers

Currently, blkg_conf_prep() expects input to be of the following form

 MAJ:MIN NUM

and reads the NUM part into blkg_conf_ctx->v.  This is quite
restrictive and gets in the way in implementing blkcg interface for
the unified hierarchy.  This patch updates blkg_conf_prep() so that it
expects

 MAJ:MIN BODY_STR

where BODY_STR is an arbitrary string.  blkg_conf_ctx->v is replaced
with ->body which is a char pointer pointing to the start of BODY_STR.
Parsing of the body is moved to blkg_conf_prep()'s callers.

To allow using, for example, strsep() on blkg_conf_ctx->val, it is a
non-const pointer and to accommodate that const is dropped from @input
too.

This doesn't cause any behavior changes.
