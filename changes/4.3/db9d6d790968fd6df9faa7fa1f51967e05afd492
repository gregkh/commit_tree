PCI: iproc: enable arm64 support for iProc PCIe

PCI: iproc: Add arm64 support

Add arm64 support to the iProc PCIe driver.

Note that on arm32, bus->sysdata points to the arm32-specific
pci_sys_data struct, and pci_sys_data.private_data contains the
iproc_pcie pointer. For arm64, there's nothing corresponding to
pci_sys_data, so we keep the iproc_pcie pointer directly in
bus->sysdata.

In addition, arm64 does IRQ mapping in pcibios_add_device(), so it
doesn't need pci_fixup_irqs() as arm32 does.
