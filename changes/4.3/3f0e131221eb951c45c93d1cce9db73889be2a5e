zpool: add zpool_has_pool()

This series makes creation of the zpool and compressor dynamic, so that
they can be changed at runtime.  This makes using/configuring zswap
easier, as before this zswap had to be configured at boot time, using boot
params.

This uses a single list to track both the zpool and compressor together,
although Seth had mentioned an alternative which is to track the zpools
and compressors using separate lists.  In the most common case, only a
single zpool and single compressor, using one list is slightly simpler
than using two lists, and for the uncommon case of multiple zpools and/or
compressors, using one list is slightly less simple (and uses slightly
more memory, probably) than using two lists.

This patch (of 4):

Add zpool_has_pool() function, indicating if the specified type of zpool
is available (i.e.  zsmalloc or zbud).  This allows checking if a pool is
available, without actually trying to allocate it, similar to
crypto_has_alg().

This is used by a following patch to zswap that enables the dynamic
runtime creation of zswap zpools.
