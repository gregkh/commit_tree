drm/i915: Added Programming of the MOCS

This change adds the programming of the MOCS registers to the gen 9+
platforms. The set of MOCS configuration entries introduced by this
patch is intended to be minimal but sufficient to cover the needs of
current userspace - i.e. a good set of defaults. It is expected to be
extended in the future to provide further default values or to allow
userspace to redefine its private MOCS tables based on its demand for
additional caching configurations. In this setup, userspace should
only utilize the first N entries, higher entries are reserved for
future use.

It creates a fixed register set that is programmed across the different
engines so that all engines have the same table. This is done as the
main RCS context only holds the registers for itself and the shared
L3 values. By trying to keep the registers consistent across the
different engines it should make the programming for the registers
consistent.

v2:
-'static const' for private data structures and style changes.(Matt Turner)
v3:
- Make the tables "slightly" more readable. (Damien Lespiau)
- Updated tables fix performance regression.
v4:
- Code formatting. (Chris Wilson)
- re-privatised mocs code. (Daniel Vetter)
v5:
- Changed the name of a function. (Chris Wilson)
v6:
- re-based
- Added Mesa table entry (skylake & broxton) (Francisco Jerez)
- Tidied up the readability defines (Francisco Jerez)
- NUMBER of entries defines wrong. (Jim Bish)
- Added comments to clear up the meaning of the tables (Jim Bish)

v7 (Francisco Jerez):
- Don't write L3-specific MOCS_ESC/SCC values into the e/LLC control
  tables.  Prefix L3-specific defines consistently with L3_ and
  e/LLC-specific defines with LE_ to avoid this kind of confusion in
  the future.
- Change L3CC WT define back to RESERVED (matches my hardware
  documentation and the original patch, probably a misunderstanding
  of my own previous comment).
- Drop Android tables, define new minimal tables more suitable for the
  open source stack.
- Add comment that the MOCS tables are part of the kernel ABI.
- Move intel_logical_ring_begin() and _advance() calls one level down
  (Chris Wilson).
- Minor formatting and style fixes.
v8 (Francisco Jerez):
- Add table size sanity check to emit_mocs_control/l3cc_table() (Chris
  Wilson).
- Add comment about undefined entries being implicitly set to uncached
  for forwards compatibility.
v9 (Francisco Jerez):
- Minor style fixes.
