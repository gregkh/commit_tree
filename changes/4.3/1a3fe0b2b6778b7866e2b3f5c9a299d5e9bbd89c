iwlwifi: mvm: init card correctly on ctkill exit check

During the CT-kill exit flow, the card is powered up and partially
initialized to check if the temperature is already low enough.
Unfortunately the init bails early because the CT-kill flag is set.
Make the code bail early only for HW RF-kill, as was intended by the
author. CT-kill is self-imposed and is not really RF-kill.
