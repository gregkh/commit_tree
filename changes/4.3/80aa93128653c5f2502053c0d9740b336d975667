    drm/i915: Update less state during modeset.

introduced the unconditional calling of disable_shared_dpll, but didn't
fix up pre-gen5 to avoid the BUG_ON at the top of the function.

So change the BUG_ON into a gen check (alternately we could move the
BUG_ON until later, since we shouldn't have a pll struct here either,
but this seems clearer to read).

This fixes a crash on load on my x200s platform.
