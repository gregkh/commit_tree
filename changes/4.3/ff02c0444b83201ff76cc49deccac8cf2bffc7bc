rtc: s5m: fix to update ctrl register

According to datasheet, the S2MPS13X and S2MPS14X should update write
buffer via setting WUDR bit to high after ctrl register is written.

If not, ALARM interrupt of rtc-s5m doesn't happen first time when i use
tools/testing/selftests/timers/rtctest.c test program and hour format is
used to 12 hour mode in Odroid-XU3 board.

One more issue is the RTC doesn't keep time on Odroid-XU3 board when i
turn on board after power off even if RTC battery is connected. It can
be solved as setting WUDR & RUDR bits to high at the same time after
RTC_CTRL register is written. It's same with condition of only writing
ALARM registers, so this is for only S2MPS14 and we should set WUDR &
A_UDR bits to high on S2MPS13.

I can't find any reasonable description about this like fix from
datasheet, but can find similar codes from rtc driver source of
hardkernel kernel and vendor kernel.
