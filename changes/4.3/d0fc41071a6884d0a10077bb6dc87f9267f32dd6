s390/kvm: integrate HANDLE_SIE_INTERCEPT into cleanup_critical

Currently there are two mechanisms to deal with cleanup work due to
interrupts. The HANDLE_SIE_INTERCEPT macro is used to undo the changes
required to enter SIE in sie64a. If the SIE instruction causes a program
check, or an asynchronous interrupt is received the HANDLE_SIE_INTERCEPT
code forwards the program execution to sie_exit.

All the other critical sections in entry.S are handled by the code in
cleanup_critical that is called by the SWITCH_ASYNC macro.

Move the sie64a function to the beginning of the critical section and
add the code from HANDLE_SIE_INTERCEPT to cleanup_critical. Add a special
case for the sie64a cleanup to the program check handler.
