arm64: cmpxchg: patch in lse instructions when supported by the CPU

On CPUs which support the LSE atomic instructions introduced in ARMv8.1,
it makes sense to use them in preference to ll/sc sequences.

This patch introduces runtime patching of our cmpxchg primitives so that
the LSE cas instruction is used instead.
