bnx2x: Add MFW dump support

Devices with up-to-date management FW will be able to store register dumps
on their persistent storage - in case management FW identifies a fatal
error it would gather and store such dumps, which could later be retrieved
using specific debug tools.

This patch adds the necessary part in the driver in order to make the
feature operational, as well as update users [under debug] during load
in case their device contains a dump of a previous crash.
