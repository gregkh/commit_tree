blk-mq: fix q->mq_usage_counter access race

CPU hotplug handling for blk-mq (blk_mq_queue_reinit) accesses
q->mq_usage_counter while freezing all request queues in all_q_list.
On the other hand, q->mq_usage_counter is deinitialized in
blk_mq_free_queue() before deleting the queue from all_q_list.

So if CPU hotplug event occurs in the window, percpu_ref_kill() is
called with q->mq_usage_counter which has already been marked dead,
and it triggers warning.  Fix it by deleting the queue from all_q_list
earlier than destroying q->mq_usage_counter.
