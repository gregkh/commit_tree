MIPS: mips-cm: Implement mips_cm_revision

Provide a function to trivially return the version of the CM present in
the system, or 0 if no CM is present. The mips_cm_revision() will be
used later on to determine the CM register width, so it must not use
the regular CM accessors to read the revision register since that will
lead to build failures due to recursive inlines.
