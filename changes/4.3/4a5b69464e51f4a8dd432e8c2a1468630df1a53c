xen/events: Support event channel rebind on ARM

Currently, the event channel rebind code is gated with the presence of
the vector callback.

The virtual interrupt controller on ARM has the concept of per-CPU
interrupt (PPI) which allow us to support per-VCPU event channel.
Therefore there is no need of vector callback for ARM.

Xen is already using a free PPI to notify the guest VCPU of an event.
Furthermore, the xen code initialization in Linux (see
arch/arm/xen/enlighten.c) is requesting correctly a per-CPU IRQ.

Introduce new helper xen_support_evtchn_rebind to allow architecture
decide whether rebind an event is support or not. It will always return
true on ARM and keep the same behavior on x86.

This is also allow us to drop the usage of xen_have_vector_callback
entirely in the ARM code.
