spi: img-spfi: check for max speed supported by the spfi block

Maximum speed supported by spfi is limited to 1/4 of the spfi clock.

But in some SoCs the maximum speed supported by the spfi block can
be limited to less than 1/4 of the spfi clock. In such cases we have
to define the limit in the device tree so that the driver can pick
it up.
