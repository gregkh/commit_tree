staging: wilc1000: fix build failure

commit 80279fb7ba5b ("cfg80211: properly send
NL80211_ATTR_DISCONNECTED_BY_AP in disconnect") has changed the api of
cfg80211_disconnected() and caused a build failure.
Add the extra argument as false since it appears from the code that the
disconnection is not locally generated.
And incase of doubt we can use false as that is the default behaviour.
