dlm: fix reconnecting but not sending data

There are cases on which lowcomms_connect_sock() is called directly,
which caused the CF_WRITE_PENDING flag to not bet set upon reconnect,
specially on send_to_sock() error handling. On this last, the flag was
already cleared and no further attempt on transmitting would be done.

As dlm tends to connect when it needs to transmit something, it makes
sense to always mark this flag right after the connect.
