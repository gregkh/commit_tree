writeback: remove broken rbtree_postorder_for_each_entry_safe() usage in cgwb_bdi_destroy()

a20135ffbc44 ("writeback: don't drain bdi_writeback_congested on bdi
destruction") added rbtree_postorder_for_each_entry_safe() which is
used to remove all entries; however, according to Cody, the iterator
isn't safe against operations which may rebalance the tree.  Fix it by
switching to repeatedly removing rb_first() until empty.
