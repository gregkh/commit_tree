modsign: Add explicit CONFIG_SYSTEM_TRUSTED_KEYS option

Let the user explicitly provide a file containing trusted keys, instead of
just automatically finding files matching *.x509 in the build tree and
trusting whatever we find. This really ought to be an *explicit*
configuration, and the build rules for dealing with the files were
fairly painful too.

Fix applied from James Morris that removes an '=' from a macro definition
in kernel/Makefile as this is a feature that only exists from GNU make 3.82
onwards.
