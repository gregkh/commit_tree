MIPS: math-emu: Add support for the CMP.condn.fmt R6 instruction

Add support for emulating the new CMP.condn.fmt R6 instructions and
return SIGILL for the old C.cond.fmt if R2 emulation is not enabled
since it's not supported by R6.

The functionality of the new CMP.condn.fmt is the following one:

If the comparison specified by the condn field of the instruction
is true for the operand values, the result is true; otherwise, the
result is false. If no exception is taken, the result is written into
FPR fd; true is all 1s and false is all 0s repeated the operand width
of fmt. All other bits beyond the operand width fmt are UNPREDICTABLE.
