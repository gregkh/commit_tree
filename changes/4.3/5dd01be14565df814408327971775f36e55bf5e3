userfaultfd: selftest: don't error out if pthread_mutex_t isn't identical

On ppc big endian this check fails, the mutex doesn't necessarily need
to be identical for all pages after pthread_mutex_lock/unlock cycles.
The count verification (outside of the pthread_mutex_t structure)
suffices and that is retained.
