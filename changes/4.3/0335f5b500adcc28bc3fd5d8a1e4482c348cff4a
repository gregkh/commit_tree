ipv4: apply lwtunnel encap for locally-generated packets

lwtunnel encap is applied for forwarded packets, but not for
locally-generated packets. This is because the output function is not
overridden in __mkroute_output, unlike it is in __mkroute_input.

The lwtunnel state is correctly set on the rth through the call to
rt_set_nexthop, so all that needs to be done is to override the dst
output function to be lwtunnel_output if there is lwtunnel state
present and it requires output redirection.
