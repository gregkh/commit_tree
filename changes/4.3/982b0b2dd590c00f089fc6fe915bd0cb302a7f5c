drm/i915: Fix CSR MMIO address check

Fix a wrong logical AND (&&) used for the range check of CSR MMIO.

Spotted nicely by gcc -Wlogical-op flag:
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_csr.c: In function ‘finish_csr_load’:
  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_csr.c:353:41: warning: logical ‘and’ of mutually exclusive tests is always false [-Wlogical-op]

Fixes: eb805623d8b1 ('drm/i915/skl: Add support to load SKL CSR firmware.')
