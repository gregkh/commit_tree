ipv6: Implement different admin modes for automatic flow labels

Change the meaning of net.ipv6.auto_flowlabels to provide a mode for
automatic flow labels generation. There are four modes:

0: flow labels are disabled
1: flow labels are enabled, sockets can opt-out
2: flow labels are allowed, sockets can opt-in
3: flow labels are enabled and enforced, no opt-out for sockets

np->autoflowlabel is initialized according to the sysctl value.
