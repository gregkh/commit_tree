clk: Allow providers to configure min/max rates

clk providers are using the consumer APIs to set min/max rates on
the clock they're providing. To encourage clk providers to move
away from the consumer APIs, add a provider API to set the
min/max rate of a clock. The assumption is that this is done
before the clock can be requested via clk_get() and that the
clock rate is already within the boundaries of the min/max that's
configured.
