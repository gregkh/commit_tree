Documentation: dt: update ti,am33xx-hsmmc swakeup workaround

Before 5b83b2234be6733cf the driver was hard coding the wakeup irq to
be active low. The generic pm wakeirq does not override the active
high/low parameter, hence it must be specified correctly in the
device tree.
Mind that SDIO IRQ is active low as defined in the SDIO specification
