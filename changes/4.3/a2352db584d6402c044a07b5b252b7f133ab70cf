ACPICA: Disassembler: Cleanup acpi_gbl_db_opt_verbose acpiexec usage

ACPICA commit 42d7ad7bfb1cfb95183c1386c77509f2036f521d

When acpi_gbl_db_opt_verbose is used in acpi_dm_descending_op() (invoked by
acpi_dm_disassemble()), it is actually exported by the disassembler but used
by the debugger to distinguish the output of the disassembler for different
debugger commands. It is by default TRUE but is set to FALSE for control
method disassembly command - "disassemble". So it's initialization should
be a part of the ACPI_DISASSEMBLER conditioned code. This patch uses
ACPI_INIT_GLOBAL to achieve a clean manner so that when ACPI_DISASSEMBLER
is not defined, ACPI_DEBUGGER conditioned code needn't link to this option.
Since it is a disassembler exported variable, it is renamed to
acpi_gbl_dm_opt_Verbose in this patch.

As VERBOSE_PRINT() macro has only one user, this patch also removes the
definition of this macro. Lv Zheng.

This patch doesn't affect Linux kernel.
