xprtrdma: Don't require LOCAL_DMA_LKEY support for fastreg

There is no need to require LOCAL_DMA_LKEY support as the
PD allocation makes sure that there is a local_dma_lkey. Also
correctly set a return value in error path.

This caused a NULL pointer dereference in mlx5 which removed
the support for LOCAL_DMA_LKEY.
