MIPS: Add implementation of dma_map_ops.mmap()

The generic implementation of dma_map_ops.mmap(), dma_common_mmap(),
is not correct for non-coherent devices. It expects to be passed a
virtual address previously returned by dma_alloc_coherent(), which for
a non-coherent device will return a KSEG1 address. It then attempts to
convert that virtual address to a physical address using virt_to_page()
which will yield an incorrect address.

Also, dma_common_mmap() does not handle the DMA_ATTR_WRITE_COMBINE
attribute, and therefore dma_mmap_writecombine() will not actually set
the appropriate pgprot_t flags for write combining.

This patch adds an implementation of dma_map_ops.mmap() that correctly
handles KSEG1 addresses, and enables write combining when requested.
