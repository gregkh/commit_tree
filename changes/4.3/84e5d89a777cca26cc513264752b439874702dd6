perf scripts python: Add new compaction-times script

This patch creates a new script (compaction-times) to report time
spent in mm compaction. It is possible to report times in nanoseconds
(default) or microseconds (-u).

The option -p will break down results by process id, -pv will further
decompose by each compaction entry/exit.

For each compaction entry/exit what is reported is controlled by the
options:

  -t   report only timing
  -m   report migration stats
  -ms  report migration scanner stats
  -fs  report free scanner stats

The default is to report all.

Entries may be further filtered by pid, pid-range or comm (regex).

The script is useful when analysing workloads that compact memory. The
most common example will be THP allocations on systems with a lot of
uptime that has fragmented memory.

This is an example of using the script to analyse a thpscale from
mmtests which deliberately fragments memory and allocates THP in 4
separate threads

  ..... output continues ...

Changes since v1:
- report stats for isolate_migratepages and isolate_freepages
  (Vlastimil Babka)
- refactor code to achieve above
- add help text
- output to stdout/stderr explicitly
