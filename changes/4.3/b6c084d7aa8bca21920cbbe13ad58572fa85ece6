ARM: perf: extend interrupt-affinity property for PPIs

On systems containing multiple, heterogeneous clusters we need a way to
associate a PMU "device" with the CPU(s) on which it exists. For PMUs
that signal overflow with SPIs, this relationship is determined via the
"interrupt-affinity" property, which contains a list of phandles to CPU
nodes for the PMU. For PMUs using PPIs, the per-cpu nature of the
interrupt isn't enough to determine the set of CPUs which actually
contain the device.

This patch allows the interrupt-affinity property to be specified on a
PMU node irrespective of the interrupt type. For PPIs, it identifies
the set of CPUs signalling the PPI in question.
