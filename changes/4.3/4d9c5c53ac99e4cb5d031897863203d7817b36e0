test_bpf: add bpf_skb_vlan_push/pop() tests

improve accuracy of timing in test_bpf and add two stress tests:
- {skb->data[0], get_smp_processor_id} repeated 2k times
- {skb->data[0], vlan_push} x 68 followed by {skb->data[0], vlan_pop} x 68

1st test is useful to test performance of JIT implementation of BPF_LD_ABS
together with BPF_CALL instructions.
2nd test is stressing skb_vlan_push/pop logic together with skb->data access
via BPF_LD_ABS insn which checks that re-caching of skb->data is done correctly.

In order to call bpf_skb_vlan_push() from test_bpf.ko have to add
three export_symbol_gpl.
