drm/nouveau/pm: add concept of sources

A source (or multiplexer) is a tuple addr+mask+shift which allows to
control a block of signals. The maximum number of sources that a signal
can define is arbitrary limited to 8 and this should be large enough.
This patch allows to define multi-level of sources for a signal.

Each different sources are stored to a global list and will be exposed
to the userspace through the nvif interface in order to avoid conflicts.
