watchdog: sunxi: fix activation of system reset

Commit f2147de33470 ("watchdog: sunxi: support parameterized compatible
strings") introduced a regression in sunxi_wdt_start(), by which
the system reset function of the watchdog is not enabled upon
starting the watchdog. As a result, the system is not reset when the
watchdog expires. Fix it.
