Revert "drm/i915: Read hw state into an atomic state struct, v2."

This reverts commit 3bae26eb2991c00670df377cf6c3bc2b0577e82a.

Seems it introduces regressions for 3 different reasons, oh boy..

In bug #90868 as I can see the atomic state will be restored on
resume without the planes being set up properly. Because plane
setup here requires the atomic state, we'll have to settle
for committing atomic planes first.

In bug #90861 the failure appears to affect mostly DP devices,
and happens because reading out the atomic state prevents a modeset
on boot, which would require better hw state readout.

In bug #90874 it's shown that cdclk should be part of the atomic
state, so only performing a single modeset during resume excarbated
the issue.

It's better to fix those issues first, and then commit this patch,
so do that temporarily.
