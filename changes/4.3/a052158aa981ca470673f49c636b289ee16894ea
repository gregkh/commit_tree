ath10k: fix QCA61X4 boot up

commit a521ee983d312db7 ("ath10k: Add new reg_address/mask to hw register
table") broke QCA61x4 support by providing wrong
fw_indicator_address, which should have been 0x0003a028 instead of 0x00009028.

User experience was a failing boot up sequence (crashing device during
initialization):

[  181.663874] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: enabling device (0000 -> 0002)
[  181.664787] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: pci irq msi-x interrupts 8 irq_mode 0 reset_mode 0
[  181.688886] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: device has crashed during init
[  181.688897] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: failed to wait for target after cold reset: -70
[  181.688902] ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: failed to reset chip: -70
[  181.689774] ath10k_pci: probe of 0000:02:00.0 failed with error -70

Fix it by updating the address with correct value.
