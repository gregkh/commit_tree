s390/bpf: recache skb->data/hlen for skb_vlan_push/pop

Allow eBPF programs attached to TC qdiscs call skb_vlan_push/pop
via helper functions. These functions may change skb->data/hlen.
This data is cached by s390 JIT to improve performance of ld_abs/ld_ind
instructions. Therefore after a change we have to reload the data.

In case of usage of skb_vlan_push/pop, in the prologue we store
the SKB pointer on the stack and restore it after BPF_JMP_CALL
to skb_vlan_push/pop.
