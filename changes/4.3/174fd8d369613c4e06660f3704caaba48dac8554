blkcg: fix incorrect read/write sync/async stat accounting

While unifying how blkcg stats are collected, 77ea733884eb ("blkcg:
move io_service_bytes and io_serviced stats into blkcg_gq")
incorrectly used bio->flags instead of bio->rw to tell the IO type.
This made IOs to be accounted as the wrong type.  Fix it.
