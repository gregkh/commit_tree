builddeb: remove debian/files before build

Commit 3716001bcb7f ("deb-pkg: add source package") added the ability to
create a debian changelog file.  This exposed that previously the
builddeb script hasn't cleared debian/files between builds.

As debian/files keeps accumulating entries, the changes file will end up
growing indefinelty.  With outdated entries in debian/files, builddeb
script will exit with failure.  This regression impacts those who use
"make deb-pkg" target to build kernel into a .deb package and never use
"make mrproper" or other means to clean kernel tree from generated
directories.

To fix the regression, remove debian/files before starting build and in
the generated clean rule.
