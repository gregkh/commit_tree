[media] coda: use event class to deduplicate v4l2 trace events

Trace events with exactly the same parameters and trace output, such as
coda_enc_pic_run and coda_enc_pic_done, are supposed to use the
DECLARE_EVENT_CLASS and DEFINE_EVENT macros instead of duplicated
TRACE_EVENT macro calls.
This patch changes the order of parameters to coda_dec_rot_done and adds
a timestamp so it can share an event class with coda_bit_queue.
