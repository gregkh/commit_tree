arm64: Generalise msr_s/mrs_s operations

The system register encoding generated by sys_reg() works only
for MRS/MSR(Register) operations, as we hardcode Bit20 to 1 in
mrs_s/msr_s mask. This makes it unusable for generating instructions
accessing registers with Op0 < 2(e.g, PSTATE.x with Op0=0).

As per ARMv8 ARM, (Ref: ARMv8 ARM, Section: "System instruction class
encoding overview", C5.2, version:ARM DDI 0487A.f), the instruction
encoding reserves bits [20-19] for Op0.

This patch generalises the sys_reg, mrs_s and msr_s macros, so that
we could use them to access any of the supported system register.
