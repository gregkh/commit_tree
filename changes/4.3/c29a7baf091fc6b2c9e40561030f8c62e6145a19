s390/numa: add emulation support

NUMA emulation (aka fake NUMA) distributes the available memory to nodes
without using real topology information about the physical memory of the
machine.

Splitting the system memory into nodes replicates the memory management
structures for each node. Particularly each node has its own "mm locks"
and its own "kswapd" task.

For large systems, under certain conditions, this results in improved
system performance and/or latency based on reduced pressure on the mm
locks and the kswapd tasks.

NUMA emulation distributes CPUs to nodes while respecting the original
machine topology information. This is done by trying to avoid to separate
CPUs which reside on the same book or even on the same MC. Because the
current Linux scheduler code requires a stable cpu to node mapping, cores
are pinned to nodes when the first CPU thread is set online.

This patch is based on the initial implementation from Philipp Hachtmann.
