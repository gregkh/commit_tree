usb: gadget: atmel_usba_udc: add ep capabilities support on device tree binding

The recently added endpoint capabilities flags verification breaks Atmel
USBA because the endpoint configuration was only added when the driver
is bound using the legacy pdata interface.

Convert endpoint configuration to new capabilities model when driver is
bound to a device tree as well.
