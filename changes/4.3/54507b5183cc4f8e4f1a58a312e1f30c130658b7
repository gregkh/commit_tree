checkpatch: add __pmem to $Sparse annotations

commit 61031952f4c8 ("arch, x86: pmem api for ensuring durability of
persistent memory updates") added a new __pmem annotation for sparse
verification.  Add __pmem to the $Sparse variable so checkpatch can
appropriately ignore uses of this attribute too.
