regmap: Add raw_write/read checks for max_raw_write/read sizes

Check in regmap_raw_read() and regmap_raw_write() for correct maximum
sizes of the operations. Return -E2BIG if this size is not supported
because it is too big.

Also this patch causes an uninitialized variable warning so it
initializes ret (although not necessary).
