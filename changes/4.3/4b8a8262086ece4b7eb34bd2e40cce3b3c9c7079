HID: picoLCD: Deletion of unnecessary checks before three function calls

The functions backlight_device_unregister(), lcd_device_unregister() and
rc_unregister_device() test whether their argument is NULL and then
return immediately. Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
