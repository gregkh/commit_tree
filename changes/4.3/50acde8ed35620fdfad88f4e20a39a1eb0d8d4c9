pm80xx: Don't override ts->stat on IO_OPEN_CNX_ERROR_HW_RESOURCE_BUSY

In case psataPayload->status has a status of IO_OPEN_CNX_ERROR_HW_RESOURCE_BUSY
ts->stat gets set to SAS_OPEN_REJECT but a missing 'break' statement causes a
fallthrough to the default handler of the switch statement overriding ts->stat
to SAS_DEV_NO_RESPONSE.
