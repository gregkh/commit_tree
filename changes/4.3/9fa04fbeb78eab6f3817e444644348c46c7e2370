of: thermal: Mark cooling-*-level properties optional

The cooling-{min,max}-level properties are marked as optional in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/cpufreq/cpufreq-dt.txt and the usage
in various device tree matches this, i.e., some cooling device in the
device trees provide these properties while others do not.

Make the bindings in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/thermal/thermal.txt consistent with
the cpufreq-dt bindings by marking the cooling-*-level properties as
optional.
