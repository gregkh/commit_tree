powerpc/nvram: print no error when pstore backend is not nvram

Pstore only supports one backend at a time. The preferred
pstore backend is set by passing the pstore.backend=<name>
argument to the kernel at boot time. Currently, while trying
to register with pstore, nvram throws an error message even
when "pstore.backend != nvram", which is unnecessary. This
patch removes the error message in case "pstore.backend != nvram".
