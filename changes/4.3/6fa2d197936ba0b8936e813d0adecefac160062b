i915: Set ddi_pll_sel in DP MST path

The DP MST encoder config function never sets ddi_pll_sel, even though
its value is programmed in its ->pre_enable() hook. That used to work
because a new pipe_config was kzalloc'ed at every modeset, and the value
of zero selects the highest clock for the PLL. Starting with the commit
below, the value of ddi_pll_sel is preserved through modesets, and since
the correct value wasn't properly setup by the MST code, it could lead
to warnings and blank screens.
