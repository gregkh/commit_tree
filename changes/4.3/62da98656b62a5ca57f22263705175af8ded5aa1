netfilter: nf_conntrack: make nf_ct_zone_dflt built-in

Fengguang reported, that some randconfig generated the following linker
issue with nf_ct_zone_dflt object involved:

  [...]
  CC      init/version.o
  LD      init/built-in.o
  net/built-in.o: In function `ipv4_conntrack_defrag':
  nf_defrag_ipv4.c:(.text+0x93e95): undefined reference to `nf_ct_zone_dflt'
  net/built-in.o: In function `ipv6_defrag':
  nf_defrag_ipv6_hooks.c:(.text+0xe3ffe): undefined reference to `nf_ct_zone_dflt'
  make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

Given that configurations exist where we have a built-in part, which is
accessing nf_ct_zone_dflt such as the two handlers nf_ct_defrag_user()
and nf_ct6_defrag_user(), and a part that configures nf_conntrack as a
module, we must move nf_ct_zone_dflt into a fixed, guaranteed built-in
area when netfilter is configured in general.

Therefore, split the more generic parts into a common header under
include/linux/netfilter/ and move nf_ct_zone_dflt into the built-in
section that already holds parts related to CONFIG_NF_CONNTRACK in the
netfilter core. This fixes the issue on my side.
