i40e: Remove incorrect #ifdef's

This patch removes some #ifdef's that should not be there. They
were stopping code that is needed from being compiled in.

With these #ifdef's removed, changes are needed in the driver
to fix some compile errors: adding missing parameters to
the definition of ndo_bridge_setlink and a ndo_dflt_brige_getlink call.
