serial: samsung: fix DMA mode enter condition for small FIFO sizes

Due to some of serial ports can have FIFO size smaller than cache line
size, and because of need to align DMA buffer address to cache line size,
it's necessary to calculate minimum number of bytes for which we want
to start DMA transaction to be at least cache line size. The simplest
way to meet this requirement is to get maximum of cache line size and
FIFO size.
