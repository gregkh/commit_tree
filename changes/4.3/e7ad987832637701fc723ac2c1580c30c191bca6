drm/i915/skl: Skip remaining dividers when deviation is 0

We can't improve a 0 deviation, so when we find such a divider, skip the
remaining ones they won't be better.

This short-circuit the search for 34 of the 373 test frequencies in the
corresponding i-g-t test (tools/skl_compute_wrpll)

v2: Place the short-circuiting code in skl_compute_wrpll() (Paulo)

(I'm sure nobody will notice the spurious removal of a blank line)
