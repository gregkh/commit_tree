KVM: x86: fix RSM into 64-bit protected mode

In order to get into 64-bit protected mode, you need to enable
paging while EFER.LMA=1.  For this to work, CS.L must be 0.
Currently, we load the segments before CR0 and CR4, which means
that if RSM returns into 64-bit protected mode CS.L is already 1
and everything breaks.

Luckily, CS.L=0 is always the case when executing RSM, because it
is forbidden to execute RSM from 64-bit protected mode.  Hence it
is enough to load CR0 and CR4 first, and only then the segments.
