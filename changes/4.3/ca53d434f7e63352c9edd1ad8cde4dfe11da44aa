x86/uv/time: Migrate to new set-state interface

Migrate uv driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

We weren't doing anything while switching modes other than in shutdown
mode and so those are not implemented.
