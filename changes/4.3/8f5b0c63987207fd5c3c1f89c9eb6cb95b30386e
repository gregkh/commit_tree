xen: eliminate scalability issues from initial mapping setup

Direct Xen to place the initial P->M table outside of the initial
mapping, as otherwise the 1G (implementation) / 2G (theoretical)
restriction on the size of the initial mapping limits the amount
of memory a domain can be handed initially.

As the initial P->M table is copied rather early during boot to
domain private memory and it's initial virtual mapping is dropped,
the easiest way to avoid virtual address conflicts with other
addresses in the kernel is to use a user address area for the
virtual address of the initial P->M table. This allows us to just
throw away the page tables of the initial mapping after the copy
without having to care about address invalidation.

It should be noted that this patch won't enable a pv-domain to USE
more than 512 GB of RAM. It just enables it to be started with a
P->M table covering more memory. This is especially important for
being able to boot a Dom0 on a system with more than 512 GB memory.
