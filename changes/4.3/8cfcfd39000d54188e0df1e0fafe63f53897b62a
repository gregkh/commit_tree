acpi-cpufreq: Fix an ACPI perf unregister issue

As policy->cpu may not be same in acpi_cpufreq_cpu_init() and
acpi_cpufreq_cpu_exit(). There is a risk that we use different CPU
to un/register ACPI performance. So acpi_processor_unregister_performance()
may not be able to do the cleanup work. That causes a memory leak. And
if there will be another acpi_processor_register_performance() call,
it may also fail thanks to the internal check of pr->performace.

So add a new struct acpi_cpufreq_data field, acpi_perf_cpu, to fix
this issue.
