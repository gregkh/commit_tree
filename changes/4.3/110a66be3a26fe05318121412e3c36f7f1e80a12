drivers: staging: unisys: add MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE and temporary MODULE_ALIAS lines to visornic

This patch adds an module alias and a MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE to autoload the
visornic driver when an appropriate device is created by the visorbus.

Note, the correct way of fixing this is adding functionality to
scripts/mod/file2alias.c for the visorbus bus type.
