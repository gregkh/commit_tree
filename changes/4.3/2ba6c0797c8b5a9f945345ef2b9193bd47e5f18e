igb: Fix i354 88E1112 PHY on RCC boards using AutoMediaDetect

e1000_check_for_link_media_swap() checks PHY page 0 for copper and PHY
page 1 for "other" (fiber) link. The switch back from page 1 to page 0
happened too soon, before e1000_check_for_link_82575() is executed, and
link on fiber (other) was never detected. Check for link while still on
the proper PHY page.
