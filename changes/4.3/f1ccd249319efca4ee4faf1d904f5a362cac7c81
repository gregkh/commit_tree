x86/smpboot: Fix cpu_init_udelay=10000 corner case boot parameter misbehavior

For legacy machines cpu_init_udelay defaults to 10,000.
For modern machines it is set to 0.

The user should be able to set cpu_init_udelay to
any value on the cmdline, including 10,000.

Before this patch, that was seen as "unchanged from default"
and thus on a modern machine, the user request was ignored
and the delay was set to 0.
