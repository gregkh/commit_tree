ARC: make futex_atomic_cmpxchg_inatomic() return bimodal

Callers of cmpxchg_futex_value_locked() in futex code expect bimodal
return value:
  !0 (essentially -EFAULT as failure)
   0 (success)

Before this patch, the success return value was old value of futex,
which could very well be non zero, causing caller to possibly take the
failure path erroneously.

Fix that by returning 0 for success

(This fix was done back in 2011 for all upstream arches, which ARC
obviously missed)
