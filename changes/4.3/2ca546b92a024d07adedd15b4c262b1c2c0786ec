IB/sa: Route SA pathrecord query through netlink

This patch routes a SA pathrecord query to netlink first and processes the
response appropriately. If a failure is returned, the request will be sent
through IB. The decision whether to route the request to netlink first is
determined by the presence of a listener for the local service netlink
multicast group. If the user-space local service netlink multicast group
listener is not present, the request will be sent through IB, just like
what is currently being done.
