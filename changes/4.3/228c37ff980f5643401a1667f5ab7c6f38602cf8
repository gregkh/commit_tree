sign-file: Document dependency on OpenSSL devel libraries

The revised sign-file program is no longer a script that wraps the openssl
program, but now rather a program that makes use of OpenSSL's crypto
library.  This means that to build the sign-file program, the kernel build
process now has a dependency on the OpenSSL development packages in
addition to OpenSSL itself.

Document this in Kconfig and in module-signing.txt.
