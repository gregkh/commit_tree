perf trace: Do not show syscall tracepoint filter in the --no-syscalls case

We were accessing trace->syscalls.events members even when that struct
wasn't initialized, i.e. --no-syscalls was specified on the command
line, fix it to show that, still in debug mode, when we have an event
qualifier list, i.e. when we actually are doing subset syscall tracing.
