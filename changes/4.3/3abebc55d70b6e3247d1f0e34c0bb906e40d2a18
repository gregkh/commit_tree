perf record: Let user have timestamps with per-thread recording

If the option -T is used with option --per-thread, then time is still
not sampled.  Fix that by using OPT_BOOLEAN_SET to distinguish when the
user used the -T option as opposed to the default case when timestamps
are enabled but only for per-cpu recording.
