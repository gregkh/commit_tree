tty: fix data race in flush_to_ldisc

flush_to_ldisc reads port->itty and checks that it is not NULL,
concurrently release_tty sets port->itty to NULL. It is possible
that flush_to_ldisc loads port->itty once, ensures that it is
not NULL, but then reloads it again and uses. The second load
can already return NULL, which will cause a crash.

Use READ_ONCE to read port->itty.

The data race was found with KernelThreadSanitizer (KTSAN).
