powerpc/32: memset(0): use cacheable_memzero

cacheable_memzero uses dcbz instruction and is more efficient than
memset(0) when the destination is in RAM

This patch renames memset as generic_memset, and defines memset
as a prolog to cacheable_memzero. This prolog checks if the byte
to set is 0. If not, it falls back to generic_memcpy()

cacheable_memzero disappears as it is not referenced anywhere anymore
