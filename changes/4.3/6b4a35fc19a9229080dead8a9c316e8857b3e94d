lib/test_kasan.c: make kmalloc_oob_krealloc_less more correctly

In kmalloc_oob_krealloc_less, I think it is better to test
the size2 boundary.

If we do not call krealloc, the access of position size1 will still cause
out-of-bounds and access of position size2 does not.  After call krealloc,
the access of position size2 cause out-of-bounds.  So using size2 is more
correct.
