NFS/RDMA Release resources in svcrdma when device is removed

When removing underlying RDMA device, the rmmod will hang forever if there
are any outstanding NFS/RDMA client mounts. The outstanding NFS/RDMA counts
could also prevent the server from shutting down. Further debugging shows
that the existing connections are not teared down and resource are not
released when receiving RDMA_CM_EVENT_DEVICE_REMOVAL event. It seems the
original code missing svc_xprt_put() in RDMA_CM_EVENT_REMOVAL event handler
thus svc_xprt_free is never invoked to release the existing connection
resources.

The patch has been passed removing, adding device back and forth without
stopping NFS/RDMA service. This will also allow a device to be unplugged
and swapped out without shutting down NFS service.
