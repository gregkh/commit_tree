switchdev: add offload_fwd_mark generator helper

skb->offload_fwd_mark and dev->offload_fwd_mark are 32-bit and should be
unique for device and may even be unique for a sub-set of ports within
device, so add switchdev helper function to generate unique marks based on
port's switch ID and group_ifindex.  group_ifindex would typically be the
container dev's ifindex, such as the bridge's ifindex.

The generator uses a global hash table to store offload_fwd_marks hashed by
{switch ID, group_ifindex} key.
