Input: serio - fix blocking of parport

If parkbd_allocate_serio() fails to allocate memory we are releasing the
parport but we missed unregistering the device. As a result this device
with exclusive access to that parport remains registered. And no other
device will be able to use that parport even though this driver has
failed to load.
