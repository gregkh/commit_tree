hv_netvsc: Wait for sub-channels to be processed during probe

The current code returns from probe without waiting for the proper handling
of subchannels that may be requested. If the netvsc driver were to be rapidly
loaded/unloaded, we can  trigger a panic as the unload will be tearing
down state that may not have been fully setup yet. We fix this issue by making
sure that we return from the probe call only after ensuring that the
sub-channel offers in flight are properly handled.
