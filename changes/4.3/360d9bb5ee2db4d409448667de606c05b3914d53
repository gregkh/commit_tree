Revert "ath9k: export HW random number generator"

This reverts commit 6301566e0b2dafa7d6779598621bca867962a0a2. Oleksij Rempel
noticed that the randomness doesn't look to be good enough and Stephan Mueller
commented:

"I would say that the discussed RNG does not seem fit for hooking it up with the
hwrandom framework."

So let's the revert the patch until we are sure that we can trust this random
generator.
