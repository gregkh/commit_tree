rcu: Limit count of static data to the number of RCU levels

Although a number of RCU levels may be less than the current
maximum of four, some static data associated with each level
are allocated for all four levels. As result, the extra data
never get accessed and just wast memory. This update limits
count of allocated items to the number of used RCU levels.
