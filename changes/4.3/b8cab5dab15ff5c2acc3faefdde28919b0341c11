IB/cma: Accept connection without a valid netdev on RoCE

The netdev checks recently added to RDMA CM expect a valid netdev to be
found for both InfiniBand and RoCE, but the code that find a netdev is
only implemented for InfiniBand.

Currently RoCE doesn't provide an API to find the netdev matching a
given set of parameters, so this patch just disables the netdev enforcement
for each incoming connections when the link layer is RoCE.
