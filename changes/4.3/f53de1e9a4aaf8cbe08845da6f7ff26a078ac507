net: ipv6: use common fib_default_rule_pref

This switches IPv6 policy routing to use the shared
fib_default_rule_pref() function of IPv4 and DECnet. It is also used in
multicast routing for IPv4 as well as IPv6.

The motivation for this patch is a complaint about iproute2 behaving
inconsistent between IPv4 and IPv6 when adding policy rules: Formerly,
IPv6 rules were assigned a fixed priority of 0x3FFF whereas for IPv4 the
assigned priority value was decreased with each rule added.

Since then all users of the default_pref field have been converted to
assign the generic function fib_default_rule_pref(), fib_nl_newrule()
may just use it directly instead. Therefore get rid of the function
pointer altogether and make fib_default_rule_pref() static, as it's not
used outside fib_rules.c anymore.
