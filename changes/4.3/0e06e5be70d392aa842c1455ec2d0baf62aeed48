locking/qrwlock: Better optimization for interrupt context readers

The qrwlock is fair in the process context, but becoming unfair when
in the interrupt context to support use cases like the tasklist_lock.

The current code isn't that well-documented on what happens when
in the interrupt context. The rspin_until_writer_unlock() will only
spin if the writer has gotten the lock. If the writer is still in the
waiting state, the increment in the reader count will cause the writer
to remain in the waiting state and the new interrupt context reader
will get the lock and return immediately. The current code, however,
does an additional read of the lock value which is not necessary as
the information has already been there in the fast path. This may
sometime cause an additional cacheline transfer when the lock is
highly contended.

This patch passes the lock value information gotten in the fast path
to the slow path to eliminate the additional read. It also documents
the action for the interrupt context readers more clearly.
