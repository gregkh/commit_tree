HID: rmi: Disable scanning if the device is not a wake source

Some touchpads are configured with firmware which continues to scan for
fingers at a minimal scan rate even after receiving the HID power sleep
command. This allows a finger touching the touchpad to genrate a wake
event. This patch ensures that scanning is disabled if the touchpad is
not a wake source and ensures scanning is enabled on resume.
