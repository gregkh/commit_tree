zswap: change zpool/compressor at runtime

Update the zpool and compressor parameters to be changeable at runtime.
When changed, a new pool is created with the requested zpool/compressor,
and added as the current pool at the front of the pool list.  Previous
pools remain in the list only to remove existing compressed pages from.
The old pool(s) are removed once they become empty.
