rtc: pxa: convert to use shared sa1100 functions

Currently, the rtc-sa1100 and rtc-pxa drivers co-exist as rtc-pxa has a
superset of functionality. Having 2 drivers sharing the same memory
resource is not allowed by the driver model if resources are properly
declared. This problem was avoided by not adding memory resources to the
SA1100 RTC driver, but that prevents clean-up of the SA1100 driver.

This commit converts the PXA RTC to use the exported SA1100 RTC
functions. Now the sa1100-rtc and pxa-rtc devices are mutually
exclusive, so we must remove the sa1100-rtc from pxa27x and pxa3xx.
