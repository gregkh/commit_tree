Documentation: gpio: Explain that <function>-gpio is also supported

The GPIO documentation mentions that GPIOs are mapped by defining a
<function>-gpios property in the consumer device's node but a -gpio
sufix is also supported after commit:

dd34c37aa3e8 ("gpio: of: Allow -gpio suffix for property names")

Update the documentation to match the implementation.
