fib_trie: leaf_walk_rcu should not compute key if key is less than pn->key

We were computing the child index in cases where the key value we were
looking for was actually less than the base key of the tnode.  As a result
we were getting incorrect index values that would cause us to skip over
some children.

To fix this I have added a test that will force us to use child index 0 if
the key we are looking for is less than the key of the current tnode.
