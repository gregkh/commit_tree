cpufreq: powernv: Call throttle_check() on receiving OCC_THROTTLE

Re-evaluate the chip's throttled state on recieving OCC_THROTTLE
notification by executing *throttle_check() on any one of the cpu on
the chip. This is a sanity check to verify if we were indeed
throttled/unthrottled after receiving OCC_THROTTLE notification.

We cannot call *throttle_check() directly from the notification
handler because we could be handling chip1's notification in chip2. So
initiate an smp_call to execute *throttle_check(). We are irq-disabled
in the notification handler, so use a worker thread to smp_call
throttle_check() on any of the cpu in the chipmask.
