netfilter: nf_conntrack: push zone object into functions

This patch replaces the zone id which is pushed down into functions
with the actual zone object. It's a bigger one-time change, but
needed for later on extending zones with a direction parameter, and
thus decoupling this additional information from all call-sites.

No functional changes in this patch.

The default zone becomes a global const object, namely nf_ct_zone_dflt
and will be returned directly in various cases, one being, when there's
f.e. no zoning support.
