MIPS: mm: compile maar_init unconditionally

maar_init was previously only compiled when CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES
was not set, which has been fine since it is only called from the
standard implementation of mem_init which has the same condition. In
preparation for calling it from the SMP startup code on secondary CPUs,
move maar_init outside of the #ifndef such that it is always compiled.
