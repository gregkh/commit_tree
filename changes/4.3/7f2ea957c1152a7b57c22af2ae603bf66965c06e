tridentfb: fix hang on Blade3D with CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE

When the kernel is compiled with -Os (CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE), tridentfb
hangs the machine upon load with Blade3D cards unless acceleration is disabled.

This is caused by memcpy() which copies data byte-by-byte (rep movsb) when
compiled with -Os. The card does not like that - it requires 32-bit access.

Use iowrite_32() instead.
