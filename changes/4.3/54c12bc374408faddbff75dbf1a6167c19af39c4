drm/vmwgfx: Fix up user_dmabuf refcounting

If user space calls unreference on a user_dmabuf it will typically
kill the struct ttm_base_object member which is responsible for the
user-space visibility. However the dmabuf part may still be alive and
refcounted. In some situations, like for shared guest-backed surface
referencing/opening, the driver may try to reference the
struct ttm_base_object member again, causing an immediate kernel warning
and a later kernel NULL pointer dereference.

Fix this by always maintaining a reference on the struct
ttm_base_object member, in situations where it might subsequently be
referenced.
