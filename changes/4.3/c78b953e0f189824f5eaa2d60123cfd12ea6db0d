i40e/i40evf: Update Flex-10 related device/function capabilities

The Flex10 device/function capability has been upgraded to include
information needed to support Flex-10 configurations. This patch adds new
fields to the i40e_hw_capabilities structure and updates
i40e_parse_discover_capabilities functions to extract them from the AQ
response. Naming convention has changed to use flex10 mode instead of
existing mfp_mode_1.
