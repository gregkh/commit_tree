of_mdio: fix MDIO phy device refcounting

bus_find_device() is defined as:

 * This is similar to the bus_for_each_dev() function above, but it
 * returns a reference to a device that is 'found' for later use, as
 * determined by the @match callback.

and it does indeed return a reference-counted pointer to the device:

        while ((dev = next_device(&i)))
                if (match(dev, data) && get_device(dev))
                                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                        break;
        klist_iter_exit(&i);
        return dev;

What that means is that when we're done with the struct device, we must
drop that reference.  Neither of_phy_connect() nor of_phy_attach() did
this when phy_connect_direct() or phy_attach_direct() failed.

With our previous patch, phy_connect_direct() and phy_attach_direct()
take a new refcount on the phy device when successful, so we can drop
our local reference immediatley after these functions, whether or not
they succeeded.
