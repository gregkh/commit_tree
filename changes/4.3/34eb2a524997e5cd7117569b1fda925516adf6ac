btrfs: Remove useless condition in start_log_trans()

Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com> reported a smatch warning
for start_log_trans():
 fs/btrfs/tree-log.c:178 start_log_trans()
 warn: we tested 'root->log_root' before and it was 'false'

 fs/btrfs/tree-log.c
 147          if (root->log_root) {
 We test "root->log_root" here.
 ...

Reason:
 Condition of:
 fs/btrfs/tree-log.c:178: if (!root->log_root) {
 is not necessary after commit: 7237f1833

 It caused a smatch warning, and no functionally error.

Fix:
 Deleting above condition will make smatch shut up,
 but a better way is to do cleanup for start_log_trans()
 to remove duplicated code and make code more readable.
