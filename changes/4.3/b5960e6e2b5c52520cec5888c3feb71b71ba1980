hv_netvsc: Implement set_channels ethtool op

This enables the use of ethtool --set-channels devname combined N to
change the number of vRSS queues. Separate rx, tx, and other parameters
are not supported. The maximum is rsscap.num_recv_que. It passes the
given value to rndis_filter_device_add through the device_info->num_chn
field.

If the procedure fails, it attempts to recover to the prior state. If
the recovery fails, it logs an error and aborts.

Current num_chn is saved and restored when changing the MTU.
