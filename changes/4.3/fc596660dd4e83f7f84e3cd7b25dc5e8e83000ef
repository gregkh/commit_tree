drm/atomic: add connectors_changed to separate it from mode_changed, v2

This can be a separate case from mode_changed, when connectors stay the
same but only the mode is different. Drivers may choose to implement specific
optimizations to prevent a full modeset for this case.

Changes since v1:
- Update kerneldocs slightly.
