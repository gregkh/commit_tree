kvm: fix zero length mmio searching

Currently, if we had a zero length mmio eventfd assigned on
KVM_MMIO_BUS. It will never be found by kvm_io_bus_cmp() since it
always compares the kvm_io_range() with the length that guest
wrote. This will cause e.g for vhost, kick will be trapped by qemu
userspace instead of vhost. Fixing this by using zero length if an
iodevice is zero length.
