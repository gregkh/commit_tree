irqchip/bcm2835: Refactor handle_IRQ() calls out of MAKE_HWIRQ

For BCM2836, we want to chain into this IRQ chip from the root
controller, and for chaining we need to do something else instead of
handle_IRQ() once we have decoded the IRQ.

Note that this changes the behavior a little bit: Previously for a
non-shortcut IRQ, we'd loop reading and handling the second level IRQ
status until it was cleared before returning to the loop reading the
top level IRQ status (Note that the top level bit is just an OR of the
low level bits).  For the expected case of just one interrupt to be
handled, this was an extra register read, so we're down from 4 to 3
reads.
