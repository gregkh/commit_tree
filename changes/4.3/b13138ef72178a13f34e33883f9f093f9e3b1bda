bpf: also show process name/pid in bpf_jit_dump

It can be useful for testing to see the actual process/pid who is loading
a given filter. I was running some BPF test program and noticed unusual
filter loads from time to time, triggered by some other application in the
background. bpf_jit_disasm is still working after this change.
