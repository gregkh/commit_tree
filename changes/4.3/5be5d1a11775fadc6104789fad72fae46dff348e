rcutorture: Add RCU-tasks qualifier to dereference

Although RCU-tasks isn't really designed to support rcu_dereference()
and list manipulation, that is how rcutorture tests it.  Which means
that lockdep-RCU complains about the rcu_dereference_check() invocations
because RCU-tasks doesn't have read-side markers.  This commit therefore
creates a torturing_tasks() to silence the lockdep-RCU complaints from
rcu_dereference_check() when RCU-tasks is being tortured.
