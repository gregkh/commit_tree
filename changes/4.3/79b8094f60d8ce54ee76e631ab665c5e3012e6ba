xhci: xHCI 1.1: Contiguous Frame ID Capability (CFC)

If the Contiguous Frame ID Capability is supported (CFC = 1),
then the xHC shall match the Frame ID in every Isoch TD with
SIA = 0 against the Frame Index of the MFINDEX register. This
rule ensures resynchronization of Isoch TDs even if some are
dropped due to Missed Service Errors or Stopping the endpoint.

This patch enables xHCI driver to support CFC by calculating
and setting the Frame ID field of an Isoch TRB.
