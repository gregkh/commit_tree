dm btree remove: fix a bug when rebalancing nodes after removal

Commit 4c7e309340ff ("dm btree remove: fix bug in redistribute3") wasn't
a complete fix for redistribute3().

The redistribute3 function takes 3 btree nodes and shares out the entries
evenly between them.  If the three nodes in total contained
(MAX_ENTRIES * 3) - 1 entries between them then this was erroneously getting
rebalanced as (MAX_ENTRIES - 1) on the left and right, and (MAX_ENTRIES + 1) in
the center.

Fix this issue by being more careful about calculating the target number
of entries for the left and right nodes.

Unit tested in userspace using this program:
