target: Propigate backend read-only to core_tpg_add_lun

This patch adds a DF_READ_ONLY flag that is used by IBLOCK to
signal when a backend has been set to read-only mode, in order
to propigate read-only status up to core_tpg_add_lun() for all
future LUN fabric exports.

With this is place, existing emulation for reporting read-only
in spc_emulate_modesense() and normal transport_lookup_cmd_lun()
TCM_WRITE_PROTECTED status checking just works as expected.
