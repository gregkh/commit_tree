powerpc32: memcpy: only use dcbz once cache is enabled

memcpy() uses instruction dcbz to speed up copy by not wasting time
loading cache line with data that will be overwritten.
Some platform like mpc52xx do no have cache active at startup and
can therefore not use memcpy(). Allthough no part of the code
explicitly uses memcpy(), GCC makes calls to it.

This patch modifies memcpy() such that at startup, memcpy()
unconditionally jumps to generic_memcpy() which doesn't use
the dcbz instruction.

Once the initial MMU is set up, in machine_init() we patch memcpy()
by replacing this inconditional jump by a NOP
