drm/i915: Moved the for_each_ring loop outside of i915_gem_context_enable()

The start of day context initialisation code in i915_gem_context_enable() loops
over each ring and calls the legacy switch context or the execlist init context
code as appropriate.

This patch moves the ring looping out of that function in to the top level
caller i915_gem_init_hw(). This means the a single pass can be made over all
rings doing the PPGTT, L3 remap and context initialisation of each ring
altogether.
