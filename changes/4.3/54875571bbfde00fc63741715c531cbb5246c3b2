    drm/i915: gen4: work around hang during hibernation

using an explicit blacklist for the GENs/BIOS vendors where the issue was
reported. Later there we had reports of the same failure on platforms not on
this list.

To my best knowledge the correct thing to do is still to put the device to PCI
D3 state during hibernation, see [1] and [2] for the reasons. This also aligns
with our future plans to unify more the runtime and system suspend/resume
paths. Since an exact blacklist seems to be impractical (multiple GENs and
BIOS vendors are affected) apply the workaround on everything pre GEN6.
