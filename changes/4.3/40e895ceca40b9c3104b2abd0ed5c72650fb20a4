drm/i915: Set context in request from creation even in legacy mode

In execlist mode, the context object pointer is written in to the request
structure (and reference counted) at the point of request creation. In legacy
mode, this only happens inside i915_add_request().

This patch updates the legacy code path to match the execlist version. This
allows all the intermediate code between request creation and request submission
to get at the context object given only a request structure. Thus negating the
need to pass context pointers here, there and everywhere.

v2: Moved the context reference so it does not need to be undone if the
get_seqno() fails.

v3: Fixed execlist mode always hitting a warning about invalid last_contexts
(which don't exist in execlist mode).

v4: Updated for new i915_gem_request_alloc() scheme.
