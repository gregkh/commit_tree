perf tools: Initialize reference counts in map__clone()

Map clone was written before we introduced reference counts for
maps and dsos, so all that was needed was just a copy and then we
would insert it into the new map_groups instance.

Fix it by, after copying, initializing the map->refcnt, grabbing
a struct dso refcount and resetting pointers that may be used
to determine if a map, when deleted, is in a rb_tree.
