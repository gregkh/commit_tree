mm, dax: VMA with vm_ops->pfn_mkwrite wants to be write-notified

For VM_PFNMAP and VM_MIXEDMAP we use vm_ops->pfn_mkwrite instead of
vm_ops->page_mkwrite to notify abort write access.  This means we want
vma->vm_page_prot to be write-protected if the VMA provides this vm_ops.

A theoretical scenario that will cause these missed events is:

  On writable mapping with vm_ops->pfn_mkwrite, but without
  vm_ops->page_mkwrite: read fault followed by write access to the pfn.
  Writable pte will be set up on read fault and write fault will not be
  generated.

I found it examining Dave's complaint on generic/080:

Although I don't think it's the reason.

It shouldn't be a problem for ext2/ext4 as they provide both pfn_mkwrite
and page_mkwrite.
