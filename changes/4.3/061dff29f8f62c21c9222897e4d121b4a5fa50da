xprtrdma: Increase default credit limit

In preparation for similar increases on NFS/RDMA servers, bump the
advertised credit limit for RPC/RDMA to 128. This allocates some
extra resources, but the client will continue to allow only the
number of RPCs in flight that the server requests via its advertised
credit limit.
