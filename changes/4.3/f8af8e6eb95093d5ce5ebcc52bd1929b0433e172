mvneta: use inband status only when explicitly enabled

The commit 898b2970e2c9 ("mvneta: implement SGMII-based in-band link state
signaling") implemented the link parameters auto-negotiation unconditionally.
Unfortunately it appears that some HW that implements SGMII protocol,
doesn't generate the inband status, so it is not possible to auto-negotiate
anything with such HW.

This patch enables the auto-negotiation only if explicitly requested with
the 'managed' DT property.

This patch fixes the following regression:
