iommu/arm-smmu: Sort out coherency

Currently, we detect whether the SMMU has coherent page table walk
capability from the IDR0.CTTW field, and base our cache maintenance
decisions on that. In preparation for fixing the bogus DMA API usage,
however, we need to ensure that the DMA API agrees about this, which
necessitates deferring to the dma-coherent property in the device tree
for the final say.

As an added bonus, since systems exist where an external CTTW signal
has been tied off incorrectly at integration, allowing DT to override
it offers a neat workaround for coherency issues with such SMMUs.
