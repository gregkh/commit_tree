KVM: x86: remove unnecessary memory barriers for shared MSRs

There is no smp_rmb matching the smp_wmb.  shared_msr_update is called from
hardware_enable, which in turn is called via on_each_cpu.  on_each_cpu
and must imply a read memory barrier (on x86 the rmb is achieved simply
through asm volatile in native_apic_mem_write).
