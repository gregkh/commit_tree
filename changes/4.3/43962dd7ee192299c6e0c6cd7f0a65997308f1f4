RDS: always free recv frag as we free its ring entry

We were still seeing rare occurrences of the WARN_ON(recv->r_frag) which
indicates that the recv refill path was finding allocated frags in ring
entries that were marked free. These were usually followed by OOM crashes.
They only seem to be occurring in the presence of completion errors and
connection resets.

This patch ensures that we free the frag as we mark the ring entry free.
This should stop the refill path from finding allocated frags in ring
entries that were marked free.
