cpufreq: acpi-cpufreq: Use cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() in ->get()

cpufreq_cpu_get() called by get_cur_freq_on_cpu() is overkill,
because the ->get() callback is always invoked in a context in
which all of the conditions checked by cpufreq_cpu_get() are
guaranteed to be satisfied.

Use cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() instead of it and drop the
corresponding cpufreq_cpu_put() from get_cur_freq_on_cpu().
