ath10k: tweak interface combinations

Concurrent AP/GO operation on different channels
isn't really supported well by the firmware so
it's better to remove it from being advertised.

Also tune the way station and p2p client interface
limits are expressed to allow station + 2x p2p
client or station + p2p client + p2p go.
