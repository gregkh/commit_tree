mlxsw: core: Fix race condition in __mlxsw_emad_transmit

Under certain conditions EMAD responses can be returned from the device
even before setting trans_active. This will cause the EMAD Rx listener
to drop the EMAD response - as there are no active transactions - and
timeouts will be generated.

Fix this by setting trans_active before transmitting the EMAD skb.
