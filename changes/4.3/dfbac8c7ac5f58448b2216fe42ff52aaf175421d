NVMe: Add nvme subsystem reset support

Controllers part of an NVMe subsystem may be reset by any other controller
in the subsystem. If the device is capable of subsystem resets, this
patch adds detection for such events and performs appropriate controller
initialization upon subsystem reset detection.

The register bit is a RW1C type, so the driver needs to write a 1 to the
status bit to clear the subsystem reset occured bit during initialization.
