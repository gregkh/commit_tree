MIPS: Refactor dumping of TLB registers for r3k/r4k

The TLB registers are dumped in a couble of places:
 - sysrq_tlbdump_single() - when dumping TLB state.
 - do_mcheck() - in response to a machine check error.

The main TLB registers also differ between r3k and r4k, but r4k appears
to be assumed.

Refactor this code into a dump_tlb_regs() function, implemented for both
r3k and r4k, and used by both of the above functions.
