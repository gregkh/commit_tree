staging: lustre: fixed lines longer than 80 chars

this set of patches fixes several code style problems:
-patch 1: lines with more than 80 chars
-patch 2: comments without */ on a separate line
-patch 3: bad alignment of lines split on more than one line
-patch 4: modified comparisons against NULL
-patch 5: added spaces between concatenated strings

This patch fixes 2 lines longer than 80 chars

The first one is a function whose argument has been moved to next line.
