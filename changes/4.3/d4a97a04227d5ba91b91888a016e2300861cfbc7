xfs: add missing bmap cancel calls in error paths

If a failure occurs after the bmap free list is populated and before
xfs_bmap_finish() completes successfully (which returns a partial
list on failure), the bmap free list must be cancelled. Otherwise,
the extent items on the list are never freed and a memory leak
occurs.

Several random error paths throughout the code suffer this problem.
Fix these up such that xfs_bmap_cancel() is always called on error.
