arm64: dma-mapping: implement dma_get_sgtable()

The default dma_common_get_sgtable() implementation relies on the CPU
address of the buffer being a regular lowmem address. This is not always
the case on arm64, since allocations from the various DMA pools may have
remapped vmalloc addresses, rendering the use of virt_to_page() invalid.

Fix this by providing our own implementation based on the fact that we
can safely derive a physical address from the DMA address in both cases.
