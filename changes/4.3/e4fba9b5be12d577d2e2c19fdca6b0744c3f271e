ASoC: mediatek: Increase periods_min in capture

In capture, there is chance that hw_ptr reported at IRQ is
a little smaller than period_size due to internal AFE buffer.
In the case of ping-pong buffer:

|xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx--|-----------------------------|
                            hw_ptr < period_size

This available buffer will not be read since its size is smaller than
avail_min (which is period_size by default), and read thread continues
to sleep. If the next hw_ptr is just a little larger than buffer_size,
overrun occurs. One more period can hold the possible unread buffer.
