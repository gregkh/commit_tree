MIPS: Remove "weak" from get_c0_fdc_int() declaration

Weak header file declarations are error-prone because they make every
definition weak, and the linker chooses one based on link order (see
10629d711ed7 ("PCI: Remove __weak annotation from pcibios_get_phb_of_node
decl")).

The most elegant solution is to have a weak default implementation and
allow a strong function to override it.  Then we don't have to test
whether a definition is present, and if there are ever multiple strong
definitions, we get a link error instead of calling a random definition.

Add a weak get_c0_fdc_int() definition with the default code and remove the
weak annotation from the declaration.
