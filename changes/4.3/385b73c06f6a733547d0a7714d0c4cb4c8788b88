rcu: Get rid of synchronize_sched_expedited()'s polling loop

This commit gets rid of synchronize_sched_expedited()'s mutex_trylock()
polling loop in favor of a funnel-locking scheme based on the rcu_node
tree.  The work-done check is done at each level of the tree, allowing
high-contention situations to be resolved quickly with reasonable levels
of mutex contention.
