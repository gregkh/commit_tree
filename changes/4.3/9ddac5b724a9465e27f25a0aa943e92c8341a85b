xen: find unused contiguous memory area

For being able to relocate pre-allocated data areas like initrd or
p2m list it is mandatory to find a contiguous memory area which is
not yet in use and doesn't conflict with the memory map we want to
be in effect.

In case such an area is found reserve it at once as this will be
required to be done in any case.
