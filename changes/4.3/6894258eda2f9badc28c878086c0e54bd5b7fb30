dma-mapping: consolidate dma_{alloc,free}_{attrs,coherent}

Since 2009 we have a nice asm-generic header implementing lots of DMA API
functions for architectures using struct dma_map_ops, but unfortunately
it's still missing a lot of APIs that all architectures still have to
duplicate.

This series consolidates the remaining functions, although we still need
arch opt outs for two of them as a few architectures have very
non-standard implementations.

This patch (of 5):

The coherent DMA allocator works the same over all architectures supporting
dma_map operations.

This patch consolidates them and converges the minor differences:

 - the debug_dma helpers are now called from all architectures, including
   those that were previously missing them
 - dma_alloc_from_coherent and dma_release_from_coherent are now always
   called from the generic alloc/free routines instead of the ops
   dma-mapping-common.h always includes dma-coherent.h to get the defintions
   for them, or the stubs if the architecture doesn't support this feature
 - checks for ->alloc / ->free presence are removed.  There is only one
   magic instead of dma_map_ops without them (mic_dma_ops) and that one
   is x86 only anyway.

Besides that only x86 needs special treatment to replace a default devices
if none is passed and tweak the gfp_flags.  An optional arch hook is provided
for that.
