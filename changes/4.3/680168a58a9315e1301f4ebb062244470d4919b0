PM / OPP: of_property_count_u32_elems() can return errors

of_property_count_u32_elems() will never return 0, but a -ve error value
of a positive count. And so the current !count check is wrong.

Also, a missing "opp-microvolt" property isn't a problem and so we need
to do of_find_property() separately to confirm that.
