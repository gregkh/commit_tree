rcutorture: Check nfakewriters parameter

Currently, a negative value for rcutorture.nfakewriters= can cause
rcutorture to pass a negative size to the memory allocator, which
is not really a particularly good thing to do.  This commit therefore
adds bounds checking to this parameter, so that values that are less
than or equal to zero disable fake writing.
