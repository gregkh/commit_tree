iommu/tegra-smmu: Fix iova_to_phys() method

iova_to_phys() has several problems:
(a) iova_to_phys() is supposed to return 0 if there is no entry present
    for the iova.
(b) if as_get_pte() fails, we oops the kernel by dereferencing a NULL
    pointer.  Really, we should not even be trying to allocate a page
    table at all, but should only be returning the presence of the 2nd
    level page table.  This will be fixed in a subsequent patch.

Treat both of these conditions as "no mapping" conditions.
