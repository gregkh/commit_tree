staging: comedi: me4000: introduce me4000_ai_reset()

Introduce a helper function to stop any ai conversions and reset the
ai control register. This consolidates the common code in me4000_reset()
and me4000_ai_cancel().

Use the new helper in the ai (*insn_read) to ensure that the ai control
register is set to a known state after reading the samples.

The ai control register will now always be '0' after the (*cancel) of
a command or doing an (*insn_read). Knowing this the programming of
the register for single acquisition mode in the (*insn_read) can be
simplified.
