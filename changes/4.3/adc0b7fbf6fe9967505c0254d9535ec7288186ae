s390/boot/decompression: disable floating point in decompressor

my gcc 5.1 used an ldgr instruction with a register != 0,2,4,6 for
spilling/filling into a floating point register in our decompressor.

This will cause an AFP-register data exception as the decompressor
did not setup the additional floating point registers via cr0.
That causes a program check loop that looked like a hang with
one "Uncompressing Linux... " message (directly booted via kvm)
or a loop of "Uncompressing Linux... " messages (when booted via
zipl boot loader).

The offending code in my build was

   48e400:       e3 c0 af ff ff 71       lay     %r12,-1(%r10)
-->48e406:       b3 c1 00 1c             ldgr    %f1,%r12
   48e40a:       ec 6c 01 22 02 7f       clij    %r6,2,12,0x48e64e

but gcc could do spilling into an fpr at any function. We can
simply disable floating point support at that early stage.
