clk: ti: clk-3xxx: Remove unused structures

Sparse complains about these structures missing static, but they
also don't look to be used. Remove them.

drivers/clk/ti/clk-3xxx.c:74:30: warning: symbol 'clkhwops_omap3430es2_ssi_wait' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/clk/ti/clk-3xxx.c:157:30: warning: symbol 'clkhwops_omap3430es2_hsotgusb_wait' was not declared. Should it be static?
