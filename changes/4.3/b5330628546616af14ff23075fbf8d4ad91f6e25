mm: introduce vma_is_anonymous(vma) helper

special_mapping_fault() is absolutely broken.  It seems it was always
wrong, but this didn't matter until vdso/vvar started to use more than
one page.

And after this change vma_is_anonymous() becomes really trivial, it
simply checks vm_ops == NULL.  However, I do think the helper makes
sense.  There are a lot of ->vm_ops != NULL checks, the helper makes the
caller's code more understandable (self-documented) and this is more
grep-friendly.

This patch (of 3):

Preparation.  Add the new simple helper, vma_is_anonymous(vma), and change
handle_pte_fault() to use it.  It will have more users.

The name is not accurate, say a hpet_mmap()'ed vma is not anonymous.
Perhaps it should be named vma_has_fault() instead.  But it matches the
logic in mmap.c/memory.c (see next changes).  "True" just means that a
page fault will use do_anonymous_page().
