md: simplify get_bitmap_file now that "file" is zeroed.

There is no point assigning '\0' to file->pathname[0] as
file is now zeroed out, so remove that branch and
simplify the code.

[Original patch combined this with the change to use
 kzalloc.  I split the two so that the change to kzalloc
 is easier to backport. - neilb]
