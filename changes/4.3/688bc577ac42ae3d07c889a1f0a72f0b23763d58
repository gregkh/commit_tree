arm: KVM: Disable virtual timer even if the guest is not using it

When running a guest with the architected timer disabled (with QEMU and
the kernel_irqchip=off option, for example), it is important to make
sure the timer gets turned off. Otherwise, the guest may try to
enable it anyway, leading to a screaming HW interrupt.

The fix is to unconditionally turn off the virtual timer on guest
exit.
