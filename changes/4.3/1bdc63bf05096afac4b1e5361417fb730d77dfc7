ACPICA: Disassembler: Cleanup acpi_gbl_db_opt_disasm

ACPICA commit 969989cf7f85e2a2a0cd048cd25fc706246a48a2

This patch cleans up the following global variable - acpi_gbl_db_opt_disasm:
The setting is used to control the full disassembly feature for iasl. ACPI
debugger (acpiexec) shall have nothing to do with it. Actually, acpiexec
never links to ad_aml_disassemble().

This patch thus renames this global option to acpi_gbl_dm_opt_disasm and
removes all acpiexec and debugger references on it. Lv Zheng.

This patch doesn't affect Linux kernel.
