watchdog: iTCO_wdt: Add support for TCO on Intel Sunrisepoint

The revision of the watchdog hardware in Sunrisepoint necessitates a new
"version" inside the TCO watchdog driver because some of the register
layouts have changed.

Also update the Kconfig entry to select both the LPC and SMBus drivers
since the TCO device is on the SMBus in Sunrisepoint.
