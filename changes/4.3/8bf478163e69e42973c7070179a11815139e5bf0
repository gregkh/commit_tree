iommu/vt-d: Split up iommu->domains array

This array is indexed by the domain-id and contains the
pointers to the domains attached to this iommu. Modern
systems support 65536 domain ids, so that this array has a
size of 512kb, per iommu.

This is a huge waste of space, as the array is usually
sparsely populated. This patch makes the array
two-dimensional and allocates the memory for the domain
pointers on-demand.
