drm: Add a non-locking version of drm_kms_helper_poll_enable(), v2

drm_kms_helper_poll_enable() was converted to lock the mode_config
mutex in commit 8c4ccc4ab6f64e859d4ff8d7c02c2ed2e956e07f
("drm/probe-helper: Grab mode_config.mutex in poll_init/enable").

This disregarded the cases where this function is called from a context
where this mutex is already locked.

Add a non-locking version as well.

Changes since v1:
- use function name suffix '_locked' for the function that
  is to be called from a locked context.
