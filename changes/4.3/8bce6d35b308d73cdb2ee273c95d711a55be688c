md/raid10: fix the 'new' raid10 layout to work correctly.

In Linux 3.9 we introduce a new 'far' layout for RAID10 which was
supposed to rotate the replicas differently and so provide better
resilience.  In particular it could survive more combinations of 2
drive failures.

Unfortunately. due to a coding error, this some did what was wanted,
sometimes improved less than we hoped, and sometimes - in very
unlikely circumstances - put multiple replicas on the same device so
the redundancy was harmed.

No public user-space tool has created arrays using this layout so it
is very unlikely that zero-redundancy arrays actually exist.  Probably
no arrays using any form of the new layout exist.  But we cannot be
certain.

So use another bit in the 'layout' number and introduce a bug-fixed
version of the layout.
Also when assembling an array, if it has a zero-redundancy layout,
give a warning.
