btrfs: async_thread: Fix workqueue 'max_active' value when initializing

At initializing time, for threshold-able workqueue, it's max_active
of kernel workqueue should be 1 and grow if it hits threshold.

But due to the bad naming, there is both 'max_active' for kernel
workqueue and btrfs workqueue.
So wrong value is given at workqueue initialization.

This patch fixes it, and to avoid further misunderstanding, change the
member name of btrfs_workqueue to 'current_active' and 'limit_active'.

Also corresponding comment is added for readability.
