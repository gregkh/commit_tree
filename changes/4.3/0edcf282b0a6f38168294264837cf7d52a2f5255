netfilter: Factor out the hook list selection from nf_register_hook

- Add a new function find_nf_hook_list to select the nf_hook_list

- Fail nf_register_hook when asked for a per netdevice hook list when
  support for per netdevice hook lists is not built into the kernel.

- Move the hook list head selection outside of nf_hook_mutex as
  nothing in the selection requires the hook list, and error handling
  is simpler if a mutex is not held.
