mwifiex: remove redundant reset of cmd_wait_q status

mwifiex_cancel_pending_ioctl is called only from
mwifiex_cmd_timeout_func. There the wait_q status is set to
-ETIMEDWAIT before calling this function. Whether we reset the status
to -1 or leave it at -ETIMEDWAIT at end doesn't matter since both
are != 0 hence mean failure
