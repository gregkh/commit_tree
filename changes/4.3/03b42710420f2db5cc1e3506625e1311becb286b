mfd: da9063: Fix missing DA9063_M_DVC_RDY mask bit

Fix a missing DVC_RDY interrupt mask in struct regmap_irq definition.

The original submission of this driver did not contain all interrupt
masking definitions in the struct regmap_irq contained in the file
da9063-irq.c

The solution is to add a DA9063_IRQ_DVC_RDY entry to enum da9063_irqs
list and to add the corresponding values to compensate for the missing
mask bit in the static const struct regmap_irq da9063_irqs[] table.
