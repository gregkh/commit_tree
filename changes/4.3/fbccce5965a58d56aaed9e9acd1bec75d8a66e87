openvswitch: Extend ct_state match field to 32 bits

The ct_state field was initially added as an 8-bit field, however six of
the bits are already being used and use cases are already starting to
appear that may push the limits of this field. This patch extends the
field to 32 bits while retaining the internal representation of 8 bits.
This should cover forward compatibility of the ABI for the foreseeable
future.

This patch also reorders the OVS_CS_F_* bits to be sequential.
