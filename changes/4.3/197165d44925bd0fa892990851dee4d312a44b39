powerpc/ftrace: add powerpc timebase as a trace clock source

Add a new powerpc-specific trace clock using the timebase register,
similar to x86-tsc. This gives us
- a fast, monotonic, hardware clock source for trace entries, and
- a clock that can be used to correlate events across cpus as well as across
  hypervisor and guests.
