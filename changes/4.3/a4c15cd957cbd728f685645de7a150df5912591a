iser-target: remove command with state ISTATE_REMOVE

As documented in iscsit_sequence_cmd:
/*
 * Existing callers for iscsit_sequence_cmd() will silently
 * ignore commands with CMDSN_LOWER_THAN_EXP, so force this
 * return for CMDSN_MAXCMDSN_OVERRUN as well..
 */

We need to silently finish a command when it's in ISTATE_REMOVE.
This fixes an teardown hang we were seeing where a mis-behaved
initiator (triggered by allocation error injections) sent us a
cmdsn which was lower than expected.
