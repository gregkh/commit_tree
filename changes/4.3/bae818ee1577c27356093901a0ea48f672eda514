rbd: require stable pages if message data CRCs are enabled

rbd requires stable pages, as it performs a crc of the page data before
they are send to the OSDs.

But since kernel 3.9 (patch 1d1d1a767206fbe5d4c69493b7e6d2a8d08cc0a0
"mm: only enforce stable page writes if the backing device requires
it") it is not assumed anymore that block devices require stable pages.

This patch sets the necessary flag to get stable pages back for rbd.

In a ceph installation that provides multiple ext4 formatted rbd
devices "bad crc" messages appeared regularly (ca 1 message every 1-2
minutes on every OSD that provided the data for the rbd) in the
OSD-logs before this patch. After this patch this messages are pretty
much gone (only ca 1-2 / month / OSD).
