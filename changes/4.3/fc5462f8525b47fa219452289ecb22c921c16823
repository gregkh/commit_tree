toshiba_acpi: Add /dev/toshiba_acpi device

There were previous attempts to "merge" the toshiba SMM module to the
toshiba_acpi one, they were trying to imitate what the old toshiba
module does, however, some models (TOS1900 devices) come with a
"crippled" implementation and do not provide all the "features" a
"genuine" Toshiba BIOS does.

This patch adds a new device called toshiba_acpi, which aim is to
enable userspace to access the SMM on Toshiba laptops via ACPI calls.

Creating a new convenience _IOWR command to access the SCI functions
by opening/closing the SCI internally to avoid buggy BIOS, while at
the same time providing backwards compatibility.

Older programs (and new) who wish to access the SMM on newer models
can do it by pointing their path to /dev/toshiba_acpi (instead of
/dev/toshiba) as the toshiba.h header was modified to reflect these
changes as well as adds all the toshiba_acpi paths and command,
however, it is strongly recommended to use the new IOCTL for any
SCI command to avoid any buggy BIOS.
