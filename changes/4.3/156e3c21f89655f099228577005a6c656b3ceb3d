net: netcp: remove dead code from the driver

netcp_core is the first driver that will get initialized and the modules
(ethss, pa etc) will then get initialized. So the code at the end of
netcp_probe() that iterate over the modules is a dead code as the module
list will be always be empty. So remove this code.
