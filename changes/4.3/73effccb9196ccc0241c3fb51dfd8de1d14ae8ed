arm64/efi: do not assume DRAM base is aligned to 2 MB

The current arm64 Image relocation code in the UEFI stub assumes that
the dram_base argument it receives is always a multiple of 2 MB. In
reality, it is simply the lowest start address of all RAM entries in
the UEFI memory map, which means it could be any multiple of 4 KB.

Since the arm64 kernel Image needs to reside TEXT_OFFSET bytes beyond
a 2 MB aligned base, or it will fail to boot, make sure we round dram_base
to 2 MB before using it to calculate the relocation address.
