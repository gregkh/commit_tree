perf: add the necessary core perf APIs when accessing events counters in eBPF programs

This patch add three core perf APIs:
 - perf_event_attrs(): export the struct perf_event_attr from struct
   perf_event;
 - perf_event_get(): get the struct perf_event from the given fd;
 - perf_event_read_local(): read the events counters active on the
   current CPU;
These APIs are needed when accessing events counters in eBPF programs.

The API perf_event_read_local() comes from Peter and I add the
corresponding SOB.
