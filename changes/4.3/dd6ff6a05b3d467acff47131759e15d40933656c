[media] rc-core: improve the lirc protocol reporting

Commit 275ddb40bcf686d210d86c6718e42425a6a0bc76 removed the lirc
"protocol" but kept backwards compatibility by always listing
the protocol as present and enabled. This patch further improves
the logic by only listing the protocol if the lirc module is loaded
(or if lirc is builtin).
