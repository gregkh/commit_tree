blkcg: reduce stack usage of blkg_rwstat_recursive_sum()

The recent percpu conversion of blkg_rwstat triggered the following
warning in certain configurations.

 block/blk-cgroup.c:654:1: warning: the frame size of 1360 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes

This is because blkg_rwstat now contains four percpu_counter which can
be pretty big depending on debug options although it shouldn't be a
problem in production configs.  This patch removes one of the two
local blkg_rwstat variables used by blkg_rwstat_recursive_sum() to
reduce stack usage.
