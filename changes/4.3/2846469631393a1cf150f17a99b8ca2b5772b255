phy-sun4i-usb: Swap check for disconnect threshold

Before this commit the code for determining the disconnect threshold was
checking for "allwinner,sun4i-a10-usb-phy" or "allwinner,sun6i-a31-usb-phy"
assuming that those where the exception and then newer SoCs would use a
disconnect threshold of 2 like sun7i does. But it turns out that newer
SoCs use a disconnect threshold of 3 and sun5i and sun7i are the
exceptions, so check for those instead.

Here are the settings from the various Allwinner SDK sources:
 sun4i-a10: USBC_Phy_Write(usbc_no, 0x2a, 3, 2);
 sun5i-a13: USBC_Phy_Write(usbc_no, 0x2a, 2, 2);
 sun6i-a31: USBC_Phy_Write(usbc_no, 0x2a, 3, 2);
 sun7i-a20: USBC_Phy_Write(usbc_no, 0x2a, 2, 2);
 sun8i-a23: USBC_Phy_Write(usbc_no, 0x2a, 3, 2);
 sun8i-h3:  USBC_Phy_Write(usbc_no, 0x2a, 3, 2);
 sun9i-a80: USBC_Phy_Write(usbc_no, 0x2a, 3, 2);

Note this commit makes no functional changes as currently we only support
sun4i - sun7i.
