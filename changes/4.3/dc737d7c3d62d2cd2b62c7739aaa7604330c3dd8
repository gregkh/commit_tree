md-cluster: transfer the resync ownership to another node

When node A stops an array while the array is doing a resync, we need
to let another node B take over the resync task.

To achieve the goal, we need the A send an explicit BITMAP_NEEDS_SYNC
message to the cluster. And the node B which received that message will
invoke __recover_slot to do resync.
