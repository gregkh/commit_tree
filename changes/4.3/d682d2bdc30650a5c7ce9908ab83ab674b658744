bnx2x: byte swap rss_key to comply to Toeplitz specs

After a good amount of debugging, I found bnx2x was byte swaping
the 40 bytes of rss_key.

If we byte swap the key, then bnx2x generates hashes matching
MSDN specs as documented in (Verifying the RSS Hash Calculation)

It is mostly a non issue, unless we want to mix different NIC
in a host, and want consistent hashing among all of them, ie
if they all use the boot time generated rss key, or if some application
is choosing specific tuple(s) so that incoming traffic lands into known
rx queue(s).
