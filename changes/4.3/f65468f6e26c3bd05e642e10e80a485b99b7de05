Bluetooth: Make __l2cap_wait_ack more efficient

Use chan->state instead of chan->conn because waiting
for ACK's is only possible in the BT_CONNECTED state.
Also avoids reference to the conn structure so makes
locking easier.

Only call __l2cap_wait_ack() when the needed condition
of chan->unacked_frames > 0 && chan->state == BT_CONNECTED
is true and convert the while loop to a do while loop.

__l2cap_wait_ack() change the function prototype to
pass in the chan variable as chan is already available
in the calling function l2cap_sock_shutdown(). Avoids
locking issues.
