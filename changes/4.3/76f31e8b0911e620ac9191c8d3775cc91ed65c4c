gianfar: Bundle Rx allocation, cleanup

Use a more common consumer/ producer index design to improve
rx buffer allocation.  Instead of allocating a single new buffer
(skb) on each iteration, bundle the allocation of several rx
buffers at a time.  This also opens the path for further memory
optimizations.

Remove useless check of rxq->rfbptr, since this patch touches
rx pause frame handling code as well.  rxq->rfbptr is always
initialized as part of Rx BD ring init.
Remove redundant (and misleading) 'amount_pull' parameter.
