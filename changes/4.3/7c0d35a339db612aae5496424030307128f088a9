MODSIGN: fix a compilation warning in extract-cert

Fix the following warning when compiling extract-cert:

  scripts/extract-cert.c: In function `write_cert':
  scripts/extract-cert.c:89:2: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]
    ERR(!i2d_X509_bio(wb, x509), cert_dst);
    ^

whereby the ERR() macro is taking cert_dst as the format string.  "%s"
should be used as the format string as the path could contain special
characters.
