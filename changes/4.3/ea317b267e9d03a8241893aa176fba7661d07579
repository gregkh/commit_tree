bpf: Add new bpf map type to store the pointer to struct perf_event

Introduce a new bpf map type 'BPF_MAP_TYPE_PERF_EVENT_ARRAY'.
This map only stores the pointer to struct perf_event. The
user space event FDs from perf_event_open() syscall are converted
to the pointer to struct perf_event and stored in map.
