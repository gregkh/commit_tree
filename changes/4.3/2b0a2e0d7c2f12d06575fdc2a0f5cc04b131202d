ath10k: handle 10.4 firmware phyerr event

Header format of 10.4 firmware phyerr event is not alligned
with pre 10.4 firmware. Introduce new wmi handlers to parse
10.4 firmware specific phyerror event header.

With changes covered in this patch, radar detection works on
qca9x0 hw 2.0 which uses 10.4 firmware.
