powerpc/dma: dma_set_coherent_mask() should not be GPL only

When turning this from inline to an exported function I was a bit
over-eager and made it GPL only. This prevents the use of pretty much
all non-GPL PCI driver which is a bit over the top. Let's bring it
back in line with other architecture.
