x86/xen/time: Migrate to new set-state interface

Migrate xen driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

Callbacks aren't implemented for modes where we weren't doing anything.
