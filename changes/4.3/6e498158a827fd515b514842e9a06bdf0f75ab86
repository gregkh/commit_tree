tipc: move link synch and failover to link aggregation level

Link failover and synchronization have until now been handled by the
links themselves, forcing them to have knowledge about and to access
parallel links in order to make the two algorithms work correctly.

In this commit, we move the control part of this functionality to the
link aggregation level in node.c, which is the right location for this.
As a result, the two algorithms become easier to follow, and the link
implementation becomes simpler.
