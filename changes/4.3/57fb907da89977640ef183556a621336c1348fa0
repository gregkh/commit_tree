iommu/fsl: Really fix init section(s) content

'0f1fb99 iommu/fsl: Fix section mismatch' was intended to address the modpost
warning and the potential crash. Crash which is actually easy to trigger with a
'unbind' followed by a 'bind' sequence. The fix is wrong as
fsl_of_pamu_driver.driver gets added by bus_add_driver() to a couple of
klist(s) which become invalid/corrupted as soon as the init sections are freed.
Depending on when/how the init sections storage is reused various/random errors
and crashes will happen

'cd70d46 iommu/fsl: Various cleanups' contains annotations that go further down
the wrong path laid by '0f1fb99 iommu/fsl: Fix section mismatch'

Now remove all the incorrect annotations from the above mentioned patches (not
exactly a revert) and those previously existing in the code, This fixes the
modpost warning(s), the unbind/bind sequence crashes and the random
errors/crashes
