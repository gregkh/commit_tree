Revert "iwlwifi: mvm: move deferred d0i3 exit to resume_complete op"

This reverts commit 088070a2f6575402d3dd82e1c5a4a8e1941805f6.

When working in d0i3_on_idle mode, we explicitly go out
of d0i3 on resume (so other potential commands could
be sent).

However, D0I3_DEFER_WAKEUP is currently cleared on
resume complete (which happens only later on), causing
d0i3 exit to timeout.

Since mac80211 was modified to accept incoming frames
once drv_resume was called, we can safely revert this
patch, and handle the pending work on iwl_mvm_resume().
