Staging:dgap :Compression of lines for immediate return

This patch compresses two lines into a single line
if immediate return statement is found. Remove variable rc as
it is no longer needed.

It is done using script Coccinelle. And coccinelle uses the following
semantic patch for this compression function:

@@
type T;
identifier i,f;
constant C;
@@
- T i;
  ...when != i
     when strict
(
  return -C;
|
- i =
+ return
     f(...);
- return i;
)
