powerpc/iommu: Support "hybrid" iommu/direct DMA ops for coherent_mask < dma_mask

This patch adds the ability to the DMA direct ops to fallback to the IOMMU
ops for coherent alloc/free if the coherent mask of the device isn't
suitable for accessing the direct DMA space and the device also happens
to have an active IOMMU table.
