fs/notify: optimize inotify/fsnotify code for unwatched files

I have a _tiny_ microbenchmark that sits in a loop and writes single
bytes to a file.  Writing one byte to a tmpfs file is around 2x slower
than reading one byte from a file, which is a _bit_ more than I expecte.
This is a dumb benchmark, but I think it's hard to deny that write() is
a hot path and we should avoid unnecessary overhead there.

I did a 'perf record' of 30-second samples of read and write.  The top
item in a diffprofile is srcu_read_lock() from fsnotify().  There are
active inotify fd's from systemd, but nothing is actually listening to
the file or its part of the filesystem.

I *think* we can avoid taking the srcu_read_lock() for the common case
where there are no actual marks on the file.  This means that there will
both be nothing to notify for *and* implies that there is no need for
clearing the ignore mask.

This patch gave a 13.1% speedup in writes/second on my test, which is an
improvement from the 10.8% that I saw with the last version.
