HID: wacom: Report touch width/height/orientation for GENERIC devices

The HID_DG_WIDTH and HID_DG_HEIGHT usages report with width and height of
contacts. From this information, a crude determination of orientation is
also possible. This patch reports all three to userspace if a device
reports this usage.
