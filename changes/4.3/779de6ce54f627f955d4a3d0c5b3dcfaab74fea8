cpu: Wait for RCU grace periods concurrently

In kernels built with CONFIG_PREEMPT, _cpu_down() waits for RCU and
RCU-sched grace periods back-to-back, incurring quite a bit more latency
than required.  This commit therefore uses the new synchronize_rcu_mult()
to allow waiting for both grace periods concurrently.
