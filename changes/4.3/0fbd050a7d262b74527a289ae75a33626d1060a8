virtio_net: add gro capability

Straightforward patch to add GRO processing to virtio_net.

napi_complete_done() usage allows more aggressive aggregation,
opted-in by setting /sys/class/net/xxx/gro_flush_timeout

Tested:

Setting /sys/class/net/xxx/gro_flush_timeout to 1000 nsec,
Rick Jones reported following results.

One VM of each on a pair of OpenStack compute nodes with E5-2650Lv3 CPUs
and Intel 82599ES-based NICs. So, two "before" and two "after" VMs.
The OpenStack compute nodes were running OpenStack Kilo, with VxLAN
encapsulation being used through OVS so no GRO coming-up the host
stack.  The compute nodes themselves were running a 3.14-based kernel.

Single-stream netperf, CPU utilizations and thus service demands are
based on intra-guest reported CPU.
