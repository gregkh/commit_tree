net: skb_defer_rx_timestamp should check for phydev before setting up classify

This change makes it so that the call skb_defer_rx_timestamp will first
check for a phydev before going in and manipulating the skb->data and
skb->len values.  By doing this we can avoid unnecessary work on network
devices that don't support phydev.  As a result we reduce the total
instruction count needed to process this on most devices.
