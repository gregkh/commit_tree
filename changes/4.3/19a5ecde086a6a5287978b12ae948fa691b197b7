rcu: Suppress lockdep false positive for rcp->exp_funnel_mutex

In kernels built with CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, synchronize_rcu_expedited()
invokes synchronize_sched_expedited() while holding RCU-preempt's
root rcu_node structure's ->exp_funnel_mutex, which is acquired after
the rcu_data structure's ->exp_funnel_mutex.  The first thing that
synchronize_sched_expedited() will do is acquire RCU-sched's rcu_data
structure's ->exp_funnel_mutex.   There is no danger of an actual deadlock
because the locking order is always from RCU-preempt's expedited mutexes
to those of RCU-sched.  Unfortunately, lockdep considers both rcu_data
structures' ->exp_funnel_mutex to be in the same lock class and therefore
reports a deadlock cycle.

This commit silences this false positive by placing RCU-sched's rcu_data
structures' ->exp_funnel_mutex locks into their own lock class.
