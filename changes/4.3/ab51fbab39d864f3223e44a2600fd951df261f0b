futex: Fault/error injection capabilities

Although futexes are well known for being a royal pita,
we really have very little debugging capabilities - except
for relying on tglx's eye half the time.

By simply making use of the existing fault-injection machinery,
we can improve this situation, allowing generating artificial
uaddress faults and deadlock scenarios. Of course, when this is
disabled in production systems, the overhead for failure checks
is practically zero -- so this is very cheap at the same time.
Future work would be nice to now enhance trinity to make use of
this.

There is a special tunable 'ignore-private', which can filter
out private futexes. Given the tsk->make_it_fail filter and
this option, pi futexes can be narrowed down pretty closely.
