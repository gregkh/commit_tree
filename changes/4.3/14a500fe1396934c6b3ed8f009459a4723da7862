ASoC: samsung: Remove redundant arndale_audio_remove

There is no use of snd_soc_unregister_card in remove function
as devm_snd_soc_register_card in probe function automatically
handles it. So, remove use of snd_soc_unregister_card and with
this change remove arndale_audio_remove as it is now redundant.
