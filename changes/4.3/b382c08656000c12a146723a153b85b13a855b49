sock, diag: fix panic in sock_diag_put_filterinfo

diag socket's sock_diag_put_filterinfo() dumps classic BPF programs
upon request to user space (ss -0 -b). However, native eBPF programs
attached to sockets (SO_ATTACH_BPF) cannot be dumped with this method:

Their orig_prog is always NULL. However, sock_diag_put_filterinfo()
unconditionally tries to access its filter length resp. wants to copy
the filter insns from there. Internal cBPF to eBPF transformations
attached to sockets don't have this issue, as orig_prog state is kept.

It's currently only used by packet sockets. If we would want to add
native eBPF support in the future, this needs to be done through
a different attribute than PACKET_DIAG_FILTER to not confuse possible
user space disassemblers that work on diag data.
