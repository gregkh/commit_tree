tracing: Introduce two additional marks for delay

A fine granulity support for delay would be very useful when profiling
VM logics, such as page allocation including page reclaim and memory
compaction with function graph.

Thus, this patch adds two additional marks with two changes.

 - An equal sign in mark selection function is removed to align code
   behavior with comments and documentation.

 - The function graph example related to delay in ftrace.txt is updated
   to cover all supported marks.
