lwtunnel: change prototype of lwtunnel_state_get()

It saves some lines and simplify a bit the code when the state is returning
by this function. It's also useful to handle a NULL entry.

To avoid too long lines, I've also renamed lwtunnel_state_get() and
lwtunnel_state_put() to lwtstate_get() and lwtstate_put().
