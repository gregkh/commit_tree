mfd: ipaq-micro: Convert to built-in platform driver

Signal that this is a built-in driver and call its probe function
immediately on init. Suppress binding attributes and delete the
.remove() function since it is never unloaded. Tag probe() and
functions only called from probe() with __init. Delete all module
macros since this is a pure built-in.
