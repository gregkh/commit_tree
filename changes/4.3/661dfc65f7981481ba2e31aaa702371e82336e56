net/ibm/emac: bump version numbers for correct work with ethtool

The size of the MAC register dump used to be the size specified by the
reg property in the device tree.  Userland has no good way of finding
out that size, and it was not specified consistently for each MAC type,
so ethtool would end up printing junk at the end of the register dump
if the device tree didn't match the size it assumed.

Using the new version numbers indicates unambiguously that the size of
the MAC register dump is dependent only on the MAC type.
