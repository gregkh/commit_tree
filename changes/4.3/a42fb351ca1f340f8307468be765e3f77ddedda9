thunderbolt: Allow loading of module on recent Apple MacBooks with thunderbolt 2 controller

The pci device ids listed in the thunderbolt driver are to restrictive,
which prevents the driver from being loaded on recent Apple MacBooks
using a thunderbolt 2 controller. In particular this prevented any
hot-plugging functionality for thunderbolt based ethernet dongles
(i.e. Apples thunderbolt gigabit ethernet broadcom tg3 based dongle
Model A1433 EMC 2590).

Changing the subvendor and subdevice to PCI_ANY_ID the thunderbolt driver
loads and binds to the pci device 07:00.0 System peripheral:
Intel Corporation Device 156c which is the thunderbolt 2 controller on
the MacBookPro12,1.

Successfully tested on MacBookPro12,1. With the patch the thunderbolt
module gets now loaded on boot. And it provides hot-plugging support both
for a cold-plugged and a warm-plugged ethernet dongle.
