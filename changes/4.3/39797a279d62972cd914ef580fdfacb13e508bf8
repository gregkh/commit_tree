net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Fix ageing conditions and operation

The comparison check between cur_hw_state and hw_state is currently
invalid because cur_hw_state is right shifted by G_MISTP_SHIFT, while
hw_state is not, so we end-up comparing bits 2:0 with bits 7:5, which is
going to cause an additional aging to occur. Fix this by not shifting
cur_hw_state while reading it, but instead, mask the value with the
appropriately shitfted bitmask.

The other problem with the fast-ageing process is that we did not set
the EN_AGE_DYNAMIC bit to request the ageing to occur for dynamically
learned MAC addresses. Finally, write back 0 to the FAST_AGE_CTRL
register to avoid leaving spurious bits sets from one operation to the
other.
