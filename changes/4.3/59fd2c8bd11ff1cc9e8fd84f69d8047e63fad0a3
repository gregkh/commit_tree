drivers, staging, unisys Add modalias files to visorbus devices

This patch adds modalias files that export the device UUID type to sysfs
so that udev can autoload the appropriate device driver on demand.  Note
that is required a minor name change to the channel device sysfs files
which are currently named visorbus_dev_groups, and are now named
visorbus_channel_groups.
