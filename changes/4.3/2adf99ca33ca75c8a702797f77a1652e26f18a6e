ath10k: Extend CE src desc flags for interrupt indication

QCA99X0 uses two new copy engine src desc flags for interrupt
indication. Bit_2 is to mark if host interrupt is disabled after
processing the current desc and bit_3 is to mark if target interrupt
is diabled after the processing of current descriptor.
CE_DESC_FLAGS_META_DATA_MASK and CE_DESC_FLAGS_META_DATA_LSB are based
on the target type.
