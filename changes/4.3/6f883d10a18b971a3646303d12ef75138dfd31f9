arm64: debug: rename enum debug_el to avoid symbol collision

lib/list_sort.c defines a 'struct debug_el', where "el" is assumedly a
a contraction of "element". This conflicts with 'enum debug_el' in our
asm/debug-monitors.h header file, where "el" stands for Exception Level.

The result is build failure when targetting allmodconfig, so rename our
enum to 'dbg_active_el' to be slightly more explicit about what it is.
