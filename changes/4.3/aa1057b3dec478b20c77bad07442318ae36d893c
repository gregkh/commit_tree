ocfs2: direct write will call ocfs2_rw_unlock() twice when doing aio+dio

ocfs2_file_write_iter() is usng the wrong return value ('written').  This
will cause ocfs2_rw_unlock() be called both in write_iter & end_io,
triggering a BUG_ON.

This issue was introduced by commit 7da839c47589 ("ocfs2: use
__generic_file_write_iter()").
