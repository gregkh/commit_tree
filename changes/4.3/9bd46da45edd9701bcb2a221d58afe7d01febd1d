xtensa: implement counting and sampling perf events

Xtensa Performance Monitor Module has up to 8 32 bit wide performance
counters. Each counter may be enabled independently and can count any
single type of hardware performance events. Event counting may be enabled
and disabled globally (per PMM).
Each counter has status register with bits indicating if the counter has
been overflown and may be programmed to raise profiling IRQ on overflow.
This IRQ is used to rewind counters and allow for counting more than 2^32
samples for counting events and to report samples for sampling events.

For more details see Tensilica Debug User's Guide, chapter 8
"Performance monitor module".
