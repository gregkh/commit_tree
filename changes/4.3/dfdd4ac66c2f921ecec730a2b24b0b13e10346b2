libxfs: bad magic number should set da block buffer error

If xfs_da3_node_read_verify() doesn't recognize the magic number of a
buffer it's just read, set the buffer error to -EFSCORRUPTED so that
the error can be sent up to userspace.  Without this patch we'll
notice the bad magic eventually while trying to traverse or change
the block, but we really ought to fail early in the verifier.
