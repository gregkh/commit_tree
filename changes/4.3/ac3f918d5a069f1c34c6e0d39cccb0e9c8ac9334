Fix resume from suspend on IBM X30

This patch fixes the resume from suspend-to-ram on the IBM X30
laptop. The problem is caused by the Bios missing to re-initialize
the iVCH registers, especially the PLL registers.

This patch records the iVCH registers during initialization, and
re-installs this register set when resuming.
