arm64: readahead: fault retry breaks mmap file read random detection

This is the arm64 portion of commit 45cac65b0fcd ("readahead: fault
retry breaks mmap file read random detection"), which was absent from
the initial port and has since gone unnoticed. The original commit says:

> .fault now can retry.  The retry can break state machine of .fault.  In
> filemap_fault, if page is miss, ra->mmap_miss is increased.  In the second
> try, since the page is in page cache now, ra->mmap_miss is decreased.  And
> these are done in one fault, so we can't detect random mmap file access.
>
> Add a new flag to indicate .fault is tried once.  In the second try, skip
> ra->mmap_miss decreasing.  The filemap_fault state machine is ok with it.

With this change, Mark reports that:

> Random read improves by 250%, sequential read improves by 40%, and
> random write by 400% to an eMMC device with dm crypto wrapped around it.
