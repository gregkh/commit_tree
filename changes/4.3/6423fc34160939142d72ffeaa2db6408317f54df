igb: do not re-init SR-IOV during probe

During driver probing the following code path is triggered.
igb_probe
->igb_sw_init
  ->igb_probe_vfs
    ->igb_pci_enable_sriov
      ->igb_sriov_reinit

Doing the SR-IOV re-init is not necessary during probing since we're
starting from scratch. Here we can call igb_enable_sriov() right away.

Running igb_sriov_reinit() during igb_probe() also seems to cause
occasional packet loss on some onboard 82576 NICs. Reproduced on
Dell and HP servers with onboard 82576 NICs.
Example:
Intel Corporation 82576 Gigabit Network Connection [8086:10c9] (rev 01)
Subsystem: Dell Device [1028:0481]
