HID: i2c-hid: Call device suspend callback before disabling irq

i2c-hid takes care of requesting and handling IRQs for HID devices
which in turns might expect them to be always active when working
in normal conditions. Hence, disabling IRQs before calling the suspend
callbacks can potentially cause problems since device drivers might
try to perform operations needing them.

Fix this by disabling IRQs only after the suspend callbacks had been
executed.
