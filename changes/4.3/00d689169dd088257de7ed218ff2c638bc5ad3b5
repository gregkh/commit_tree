mfd: max77686: Use a generic name for the PMIC node in the example

The ePAPR standard says that: "the name of a node should be somewhat
generic, reflecting the function of the device and not its precise
programming model."

So, change the max77686 binding document example to use a generic
node name instead of using the chip's name.
