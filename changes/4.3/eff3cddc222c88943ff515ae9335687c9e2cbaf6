clarify implementation of ethtool's get_ts_info op

This patch adds some clarification about the intended way to implement
both SIOCSHWTSTAMP and ethtool's get_ts_info. The HWTSTAMP API has
several Rx filters which are very specific, as well as more general
filters. The specific filters really only exist to support some broken
hardware which can't fully implement the generic filters. This patch
adds clarification that it is okay to support the specific filters in
SIOCSHWTSTAMP by upscaling them to the generic filters. In addition,
update the header for ethtool_ts_info to specify that drivers ought to
only report the filters they support without upscaling in this manner.
