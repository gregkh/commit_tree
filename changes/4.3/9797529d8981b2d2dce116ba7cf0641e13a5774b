microblaze/timer: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate microblaze driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.

We weren't doing anything in ->set_mode(RESUME or ONESHOT) and so
tick_resume() set_state_oneshot() aren't implemented.
