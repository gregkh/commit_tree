btrfs: fix compile when block cgroups are not enabled

bio->bi_css and bio->bi_ioc don't exist when block cgroups are not on.
This adds an ifdef around them.  It's not perfect, but our
use of bi_ioc is being removed in the 4.3 merge window.

The bi_css usage really should go into bio_clone, but I want to make
sure that doesn't introduce problems for other bio_clone use cases.
