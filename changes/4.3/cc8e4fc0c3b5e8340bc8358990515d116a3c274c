xhci: init command timeout timer earlier to avoid deleting it uninitialized

Don't check if timer is running with a timer_pending() before
deleting it with del_timer_sync(), this defies the whole point of
the sync part and can cause a possible race.

Instead we just want to make sure the timer is initialized early enough
before we have a chance to delete it.
