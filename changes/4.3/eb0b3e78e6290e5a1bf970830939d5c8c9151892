acpi-cpufreq: replace per_cpu with driver_data of policy

Drivers can store their internal per-policy information in
policy->driver_data, lets use it.

we have benefits after this replacing.
1) memory saving.
2) policy is shared by several cpus, per_cpu seems not correct. using
*driver_data* is more reasonable.
3) fix a memory leak in acpi_cpufreq_cpu_exit. as policy->cpu might
change during cpu hotplug. So sometimes we cant't free *data*, use
*driver_data* to fix it.
4) fix a zero return value of get_cur_freq_on_cpu. Only per_cpu of
policy->cpu is set to *data*, if we try to get cpufreq on other cpus, we
get zero instead of correct values. Use *driver_data* to fix it.
