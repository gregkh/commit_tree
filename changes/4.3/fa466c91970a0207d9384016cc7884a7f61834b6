spi: davinci: Choose correct pre-scaler limit based on SOC

Currently the pre-scaler limit is incorrect. The value differs slightly
for various devices so a single value can't be used. Using the compatible
field select the correct pre-scaler limit.

Add new compatible field value for Keystone devices to support their
unique pre-scaler limit value.
