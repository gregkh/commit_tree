net: Fix up inet_addr_type checks

Currently inet_addr_type and inet_dev_addr_type expect local addresses
to be in the local table. With the VRF device local routes for devices
associated with a VRF will be in the table associated with the VRF.
Provide an alternate inet_addr lookup to use a specific table rather
than defaulting to the local table.

inet_addr_type_dev_table keeps the same semantics as inet_addr_type but
if the passed in device is enslaved to a VRF then the table for that VRF
is used for the lookup.
