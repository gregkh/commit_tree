arm64: remove redundant object file list

Commit 4b3dc9679cf7 ("arm64: force CONFIG_SMP=y and remove redundant
#ifdefs") forces SMP on arm64. To build the necessary objects for SMP,
they were added to the arm64-obj-y rule in arch/arm64/kernel/Makefile,
without removing the arm64-obj-$(CONFIG_SMP) rule.

Remove redundant object file list depending on always-yes CONFIG_SMP in
arch/arm64/kernel/Makefile.
