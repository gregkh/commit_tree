thermal: power_allocator: exit early if there are no cooling devices

Don't waste cycles in the power allocator governor's throttle function
if there are no cooling devices and exit early.

This commit doesn't change any functionality, but should provide better
performance for the odd case of a thermal zone with trip points but
without cooling devices.
