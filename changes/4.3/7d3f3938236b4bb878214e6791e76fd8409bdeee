zsmalloc/zram: introduce zs_pool_stats api

`zs_compact_control' accounts the number of migrated objects but it has
a limited lifespan -- we lose it as soon as zs_compaction() returns back
to zram.  It worked fine, because (a) zram had it's own counter of
migrated objects and (b) only zram could trigger compaction.  However,
this does not work for automatic pool compaction (not issued by zram).
To account objects migrated during auto-compaction (issued by the
shrinker) we need to store this number in zs_pool.

Define a new `struct zs_pool_stats' structure to keep zs_pool's stats
there.  It provides only `num_migrated', as of this writing, but it
surely can be extended.

A new zsmalloc zs_pool_stats() symbol exports zs_pool's stats back to
caller.

Use zs_pool_stats() in zram and remove `num_migrated' from zram_stats.
