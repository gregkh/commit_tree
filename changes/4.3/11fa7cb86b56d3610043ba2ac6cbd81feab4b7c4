perf tools: Pass Intel PT information for decoding MTC and CYC

Record additional information in the AUXTRACE_INFO event in preparation
for decoding MTC and CYC packets.  Pass the information to the decoder.

The AUXTRACE_INFO record can be extended by using the size to indicate
the presence of new members.

The additional information includes PMU config bit positions and the TSC
to CTC (hardware crystal clock) ratio needed to decode MTC packets.
