HID: hid-lg: Add USBID for Logitech G29 Wheel

Since this wheel is now available, and the USBID is listed on their website,
this patch adds it to allow the hid-lg4ff force feedback driver to find it.

I do not have this wheel to test with, but this should at least get it working
in emulation mode.

Note: There is probably more work required for adjust HID descriptor and handle
switching between emulation and native modes.
