ASoC: ac97: Add support for resetting device before registration

AC97 devices need to be initially reset before they can be used. Currently
each driver does this on its own.

Add support for resetting the device to core in snd_soc_new_ac97_codec().
If the caller supplies a device ID and device ID mask the function will
reset the device and verify that it has the correct ID, if it does not a
error is returned.

This will allow to remove custom code with similar functionality from
individual drivers.
