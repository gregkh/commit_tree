PCI / PM: Update runtime PM documentation for PCI devices

Section 3.2 "Device Runtime Power Management" of pci.txt has become
outdated, so update it to correctly reflect the current code flow.

Also update the comment in local_pci_probe() to document the fact
that pm_runtime_put_noidle() is not the only runtime PM helper
function that can be used to decrement the device's runtime PM
usage counter in .probe().
