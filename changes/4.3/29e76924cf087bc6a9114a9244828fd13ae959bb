nfc: netlink: Add capability to reply to vendor_cmd with data

A proprietary vendor command may send back useful data to the user
application.

For example, the field level applied on the NFC router antenna.

Still based on net/wireless/nl80211.c implementation,
add nfc_vendor_cmd_alloc_reply_skb and nfc_vendor_cmd_reply in
order to send back over netlink data generated by a proprietary
command.
