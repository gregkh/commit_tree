ipv6: Fix IPsec pre-encap fragmentation check

The IPv6 IPsec pre-encap path performs fragmentation for tunnel-mode
packets.  That is, we perform fragmentation pre-encap rather than
post-encap.

A check was added later to ensure that proper MTU information is
passed back for locally generated traffic.  Unfortunately this
check was performed on all IPsec packets, including transport-mode
packets.

What's more, the check failed to take GSO into account.

The end result is that transport-mode GSO packets get dropped at
the check.

This patch fixes it by moving the tunnel mode check forward as well
as adding the GSO check.
