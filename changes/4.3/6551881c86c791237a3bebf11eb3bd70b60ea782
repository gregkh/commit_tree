Watchdog: Fix parent of watchdog_devices

/sys/class/watchdog/watchdogn/device/modalias can help to identify the
driver/module for a given watchdog node. However, many wdt devices do not
set their parent and so, we do not see an entry for device in sysfs for
such devices.

This patch fixes parent of watchdog_device so that
/sys/class/watchdog/watchdogn/device is populated.

Exceptions: booke, diag288, octeon, softdog and w83627hf -- They do not
have any parent. Not sure, how we can identify driver for these devices.
