scripts/kernel-doc: Adding cross-reference links to html documentation.

Functions, Structs and Parameters definitions on kernel documentation
are pure cosmetic, it only highlights the element.

To ease the navigation in the documentation we should use <links> inside
those tags so readers can easily jump between methods directly.

This was discussed in 2014[1] and is implemented by getting a list
of <refentries> from the DocBook XML to generate a database. Then it looks
for <function>,<structnames> and <paramdef> tags that matches the ones in
the database. As it only links existent references, no broken links are
added.
