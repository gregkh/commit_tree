ath10k: Add hw register/values for QCA99X0 chip

This is to prepare the driver for QCA99X0 chip support.
This commit adds hw_params, hw register table and hw_values
table for QCA99X0 chip. Please note this is only a partial patch adding
support for QCA99X0, so the device id is not yet added to pci device
table.
