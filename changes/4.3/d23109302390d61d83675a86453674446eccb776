xprtrdma: Don't fall back to PHYSICAL memory registration

PHYSICAL memory registration uses a single rkey for all of the
client's memory, thus is insecure. It is still useful in some cases
for testing.

Retain the ability to select PHYSICAL memory registration capability
via /proc/sys/sunrpc/rdma_memreg_strategy, but don't fall back to it
if the HCA does not support FRWR or FMR.

This means amso1100 no longer works out of the box with NFS/RDMA.
When using amso1100 HCAs, set the memreg_strategy sysctl to 6 before
performing NFS/RDMA mounts.
