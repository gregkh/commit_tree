cpufreq: propagate errors returned from __cpufreq_governor()

Return codes aren't honored properly in cpufreq_set_policy(). This can
lead to two problems:
- wrong errors propagated to sysfs
- we try to do next state-change even if the previous one failed

cpufreq_governor_dbs() now returns proper errors on all invalid
state-transition requests and this code should honor that.
