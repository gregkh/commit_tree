Revert "NFS: Make close(2) asynchronous when closing NFS O_DIRECT files"

This reverts commit f895c53f8ace3c3e49ebf9def90e63fc6d46d2bf.

This commit causes a NFSv4 regression in that close()+unlink() can end
up failing. The reason is that we no longer have a guarantee that the
CLOSE has completed on the server, meaning that the subsequent call to
REMOVE may fail with NFS4ERR_FILE_OPEN if the server implements Windows
unlink() semantics.
