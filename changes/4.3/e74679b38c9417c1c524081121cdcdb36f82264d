ASoC: db1200: Fix DAI link format for db1300 and db1550

Commit b4508d0f95fa ("ASoC: db1200: Use static DAI format setup") switched
the db1200 driver over to using static DAI format setup instead of a
callback function. But the commit only added the dai_fmt field to one of
the three DAI links in the driver. This breaks audio on db1300 and db1550.

Add the two missing dai_fmt settings to fix the issue.
