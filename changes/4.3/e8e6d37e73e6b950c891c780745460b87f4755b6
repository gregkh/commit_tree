perf hists: Update the column width for the "srcline" sort key

When we introduce a new sort key, we need to update the
hists__calc_col_len() function accordingly, otherwise the width
will be limited to strlen(header).

We can't update it when obtaining a line value for a column (for
instance, in sort__srcline_cmp()), because we reset it all when doing a
resort (see hists__output_recalc_col_len()), so we need to, from what is
in the hist_entry fields, set each of the column widths.
