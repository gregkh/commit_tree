ovl: use O_LARGEFILE in ovl_copy_up()

Open the lower file with O_LARGEFILE in ovl_copy_up().

Pass O_LARGEFILE unconditionally in ovl_copy_up_data() as it's purely for
catching 32-bit userspace dealing with a file large enough that it'll be
mishandled if the application isn't aware that there might be an integer
overflow.  Inside the kernel, there shouldn't be any problems.
