drm/probe-helper: Grab mode_config.mutex in poll_init/enable

So on first looks this seems superflous since drivers should ensure
correct ordering to not make this a problem. Otoh ordering constraints
between hdp, fbdev load and enabling polling are already tricky on
some hardware and it helps to be more robust.

But the real goal is to just shut up a locking WARN_ON I'd like to
add, which means init code gets some additional locks just for
uniformity.

v2: Also grab the lock for the public poll_enable, not just poll_init
which is used for resume, with the same justification.
