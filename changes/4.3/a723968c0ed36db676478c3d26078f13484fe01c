perf: Fix u16 overflows

Vince reported that its possible to overflow the various size fields
and get weird stuff if you stick too many events in a group.

Put a lid on this by requiring the fixed record size not exceed 16k.
This is still a fair amount of events (silly amount really) and leaves
plenty room for callchains and stack dwarves while also avoiding
overflowing the u16 variables.
