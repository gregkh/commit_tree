ath10k: add qca6164 support

This adds additional 0x0041 PCI Device ID
definition to ath10k for QCA6164 which is a 1
spatial stream sibling of the QCA6174 (which is 2
spatial stream chip).

The QCA6164 needs a dedicated board.bin file which
is different than the one used for QCA6174. If the
board.bin is wrong the device will crash early
while trying to boot firmware. The register dump
will look like this:

 ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: firmware register dump:
 ath10k_pci 0000:02:00.0: [00]: 0x05010000 0x000015B3 0x000A012D 0x00955B31
 ...

Note the value 0x000A012D.
