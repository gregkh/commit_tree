tools lib traceevent: Fix string handling in heterogeneous arch environments

When a trace recorded on a 32-bit device is processed with a 64-bit
binary, the higher 32-bits of the address need to ignored.

The lack of this results in the output of the 64-bit pointer
value to the trace as the 32-bit address lookup fails in find_printk().

Before:

  burn-1778  [003]   548.600305: bputs:   0xc0046db2s: 2cec5c058d98c

After:

  burn-1778  [003]   548.600305: bputs:   0xc0046db2s: RT throttling activated

The problem occurs in PRINT_FIELD when the field is recognized as a
pointer to a string (of the type const char *)

Heterogeneous architectures cases below can arise and should be handled:

* Traces recorded using 32-bit addresses processed on a 64-bit machine
* Traces recorded using 64-bit addresses processed on a 32-bit machine
