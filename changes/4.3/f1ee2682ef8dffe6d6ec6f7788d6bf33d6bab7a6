ath10k: ensure pktlog disable cmd reaches fw before pdev suspend

Found incorrect sequence in ath10k_core_stop() where wmi pktlog
disable cmd is passed from ath10k_debug_stop() to firmware
immediately after wmi pdev suspend cmd. Firmware will not accept
any wmi cmd after receiving wmi pdev suspend cmd.

Fix this issue in ath10k_core_stop() by moving ath10k_debug_stop()
just before sending pdev suspend cmd. So that pktlog disable cmd
will get passed before pdev suspend cmd.
