perf/x86/intel/lbr: Use correct index to save/restore LBR_INFO with call stack

Use the correct index to save/restore the LBR_INFO_x MSR in
callstack mode. This is more a cleanup, as even with the wrong
index the register was correctly saved/restored, and also
LBR callgraph mode in perf tools do not really need anything in
LBR_INFO. But still better to use the right index.
