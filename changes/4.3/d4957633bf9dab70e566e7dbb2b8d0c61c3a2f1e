perf report: Add infrastructure for a cycles histogram

This adds the basic infrastructure to keep track of cycle counts per
basic block for annotate. We allocate an array similar to the normal
accounting, and then account branch cycles there.

We handle two cases:

cycles per basic block with start and cycles per branch (these are later
used for either IPC or just cycles per BB)

In the start case we cannot handle overlaps, so always the longest basic
block wins.

For the cycles per branch case everything is accurately accounted.

v2: Remove unnecessary checks. Slight restructure. Move
symbol__get_annotation to another patch. Move histogram allocation.
v3: Merged with current tree
