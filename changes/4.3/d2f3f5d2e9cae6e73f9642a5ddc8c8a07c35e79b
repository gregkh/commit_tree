perf bench futex: Add lock_pi stresser

Allows a way of measuring low level kernel implementation of FUTEX_LOCK_PI and
FUTEX_UNLOCK_PI.

The program comes in two flavors:

(i) single futex (default), all threads contend on the same uaddr.  For the
sake of the benchmark, we call into kernel space even when the lock is
uncontended.  The kernel will set it to TID, any waters that come in and
contend for the pi futex will be handled respectively by the kernel.

(ii) -M option for multiple futexes, each thread deals with its own futex. This
is a trivial scenario and only measures kernel handling of 0->TID transition.
