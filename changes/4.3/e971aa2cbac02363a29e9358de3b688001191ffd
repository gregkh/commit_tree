x86/platform: Make atom/pmc_atom.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config PMC_ATOM
        def_bool y

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by
anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity so that when reading
the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init() translates to device_initcall() in the
non-modular case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this
commit.

We leave some tags like MODULE_AUTHOR() for documentation
purposes.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() is a no-op for non-modular
code. We correct a comment that indicates the data was only used
by that macro, as it actually is used by the code directly.
