rcu: Change return type to bool

Type-checking coccinelle spatches are being used to locate type mismatches
between function signatures and return values in this case this produced:
./kernel/rcu/srcu.c:271 WARNING: return of wrong type
        int != unsigned long,

srcu_readers_active() returns an int that is the sum of per_cpu unsigned
long but the only user is cleanup_srcu_struct() which is using it as a
boolean (condition) to see if there is any readers rather than actually
using the approximate number of readers. The theoretically possible
unsigned long overflow case does not need to be handled explicitly - if
we had 4G++ readers then something else went wrong a long time ago.

proposal: change the return type to boolean. The function name is left
          unchanged as it fits the naming expectation for a boolean.

patch was compile tested for x86_64_defconfig (implies CONFIG_SRCU=y)

patch is against 4.1-rc5 (localversion-next is -next-20150525)
