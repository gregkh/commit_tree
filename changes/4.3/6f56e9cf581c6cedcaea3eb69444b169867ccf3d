tools lib traceevent: Add checks for returned EVENT_ERROR type

Running the following perf-stat command on an arm64 system produces the
following result...

  [root@aarch64 ~]# perf stat -e kmem:mm_page_alloc -a sleep 1
    Warning: [kmem:mm_page_alloc] function sizeof not defined
    Warning: Error: expected type 4 but read 0
  Segmentation fault
  [root@aarch64 ~]#

The second warning was a result of the first warning not stopping
processing after it detected the issue.

That is, code that found the issue reported the first problem, but
because it did not exit out of the functions smoothly, it caused the
other warning to appear and not only that, it later caused the SIGSEGV.
