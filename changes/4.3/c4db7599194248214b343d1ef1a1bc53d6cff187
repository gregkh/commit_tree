drm/i915/gen8: Re-order init pipe_control in lrc mode

Some of the WA applied using WA batch buffers perform writes to scratch page.
In the current flow WA are initialized before scratch obj is allocated.
This patch reorders intel_init_pipe_control() to have a valid scratch obj
before we initialize WA.

v2: Check for valid scratch page before initializing WA as some of them
perform writes to it.
