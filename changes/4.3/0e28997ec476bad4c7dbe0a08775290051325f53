btrfs: remove bio splitting and merge_bvec_fn() calls

Btrfs has been doing bio splitting from btrfs_map_bio(), by checking
device limits as well as calling ->merge_bvec_fn() etc. That is not
necessary any more, because generic_make_request() is now able to
handle arbitrarily sized bios. So clean up unnecessary code paths.
