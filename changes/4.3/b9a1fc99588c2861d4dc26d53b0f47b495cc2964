mei: me: d0i3: exit d0i3 on driver start and enter it on stop

A BIOS may put the device in d0i3 on platform initialization so it wonâ€™t
consume power even if the driver is not present, in turn the driver has
to wake up the devices on load in order to perform the initialization
sequence and move it back to low power state on driver remove.
