mwifiex: simplify mwifiex_complete_cmd

600f5d909a54("mwifiex: cleanup ioctl wait queue and abstraction layer")
introduced the wakeup_interruptible suppression in mwifiex_complete_cmd
b1a47aa5e1e1("mwifiex: fix system hang issue in cmd timeout error case")
then added wakup_interruptible to mwifiex_cmd_timeout_func the single
place setting a status of ETIMEDOUT.
Instead of doing extra work, using the standard call-chain will have the
same effect:
mwifiex_cancel_pending_ioctl
-> mwifiex_recycle_cmd_node
-> mwifiex_insert_cmd_to_free_q
-> mwifiex_complete_cmd
-> wake_up_interruptible

The difference is that previously the condition was not set to true,
but that's probably just an oversight in b1a47aa5e1e1 and shouldn't
have any consequence
