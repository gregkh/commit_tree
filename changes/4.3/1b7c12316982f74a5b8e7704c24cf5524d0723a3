ASoC: Prevent components from being bound to multiple cards

A component can only be bound to a single card at a time. Binding it to
card while it is already bound to another will result in undefined
behavior.

As the undefined behavior might only manifest itself later on it is not
necessarily always straight forward to find the cause. To prevent this add
a check that refuses to bind a component to multiple cards as well as
prints a error describing the problem.
