irda: ali-ircc: Fix deadlock in ali_ircc_sir_change_speed()

ali_ircc_sir_change_speed() is always called with self->lock held,
so acquiring the lock inside it leads to unavoidable deadlock.

Call graph:
ali_ircc_sir_change_speed() is called from ali_ircc_change_speed()
  ali_ircc_fir_hard_xmit() under spin_lock_irqsave(&self->lock, flags);
  ali_ircc_sir_hard_xmit() under spin_lock_irqsave(&self->lock, flags);
  ali_ircc_net_ioctl() under spin_lock_irqsave(&self->lock, flags);
  ali_ircc_dma_xmit_complete()
    ali_ircc_fir_interrupt()
      ali_ircc_interrupt() under spin_lock(&self->lock);
  ali_ircc_sir_write_wakeup()
    ali_ircc_sir_interrupt()
      ali_ircc_interrupt() under spin_lock(&self->lock);

The patch removes spin_lock/unlock from ali_ircc_sir_change_speed().
