mac80211: Add support for declaring MU-MIMO capability

Add support for declaring MU-MIMO beamformee capability for
relevant hardware.
When sending association request, the capability is included if both
hardware and the AP support it, and no other virtual interface
is using it.
This is in order to avoid multiple interfaces using MU-MIMO in parallel
which might lead to contradictions in the group-id mechanism.
