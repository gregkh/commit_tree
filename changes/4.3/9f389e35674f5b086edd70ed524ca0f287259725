af_unix: return data from multiple SKBs on recv() with MSG_PEEK flag

AF_UNIX sockets now return multiple skbs from recv() when MSG_PEEK flag
is set.

This is referenced in kernel bugzilla #12323 @
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12323

As described both in the BZ and lkml thread @
http://lkml.org/lkml/2008/1/8/444 calling recv() with MSG_PEEK on an
AF_UNIX socket only reads a single skb, where the desired effect is
to return as much skb data has been queued, until hitting the recv
buffer size (whichever comes first).

The modified MSG_PEEK path will now move to the next skb in the tree
and jump to the again: label, rather than following the natural loop
structure. This requires duplicating some of the loop head actions.

This was tested using the python socketpair python code attached to
the bugzilla issue.
