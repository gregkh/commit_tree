drm/vmwgfx: Add "quirk" to handling command verification exceptions

For certain surface copies, we don't have a user space handle for
the destination surface.  In such cases, we are going to trust that
our caller is giving us the right surface ID.

To do this case, we created a quirk flag that may be useful
in the future for handling other cases.
