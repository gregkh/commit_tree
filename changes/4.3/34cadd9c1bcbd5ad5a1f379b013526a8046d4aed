spi: pxa2xx: Add support for Intel Sunrisepoint

Major difference in LPSS SPI between Intel Sunrisepoint PCH and earlier
platforms is an integrated DMA (iDMA) engine. iDMA is an IP that is private
for each LPSS host controller (UART/SPI/I2C). Other differences are private
register space offset, a few private registers that are in different
location and FIFO thresholds.

Intel Sunrisepoint LPSS SPI and iDMA devices are probed and registered in
MFD layer as platform devices. Here these compound devices are detected by
matching against known PCI IDs. This allows us to share
pxa2xx_spi_acpi_get_pdata() for setting up the platform data instead of
duplicating it in MFD part.

This patch adds configuration for Intel Sunrisepoint LPSS SPI, above
detection and DMA filter function that picks the DMA channel only from an
associated iDMA block.
