crypto: caam - Use the preferred style for memory allocations

"The preferred form for passing a size of a struct is the following:

        p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), ...);
....

The preferred form for allocating a zeroed array is the following:

        p = kcalloc(n, sizeof(...), ...); "

,so do as suggested.
