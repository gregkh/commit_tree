ARM/PCI: Set MPS before pci_bus_add_devices()

The MPS configuration should be done *before* pci_bus_add_devices().  After
pci_bus_add_devices(), drivers may be bound to devices, and the PCI core
shouldn't touch device configuration while a driver owns the device.

[bhelgaas: remove check for bus being non-NULL]
