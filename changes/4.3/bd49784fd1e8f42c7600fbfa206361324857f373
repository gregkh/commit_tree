dm stats: report precise_timestamps and histogram in @stats_list output

If the user selected the precise_timestamps or histogram options, report
it in the @stats_list message output.

If the user didn't select these options, no extra tokens are reported,
thus it is backward compatible with old software that doesn't know about
precise timestamps and histogram.
