clockevents/drivers/fsl_ftm: Migrate to new 'set-state' interface

Migrate fsl_ftm driver to the new 'set-state' interface provided by
clockevents core, the earlier 'set-mode' interface is marked obsolete
now.

This also enables us to implement callbacks for new states of clockevent
devices, for example: ONESHOT_STOPPED.
