MIPS: CPS: use 32b accesses to GCRs

Commit b677bc03d757 ("MIPS: cps-vec: Use macros for various arithmetics
and memory operations") replaced various load & store instructions
through cps-vec.S with the PTR_L & PTR_S macros. However it was somewhat
overzealous in doing so for CM GCR accesses, since the bit width of the
CM doesn't necessarily match that of the CPU. The registers accessed
(GCR_CL_COHERENCE & GCR_CL_ID) should be safe to simply always access
using 32b instructions, so do so in order to avoid issues when using a
32b CM with a 64b CPU.
