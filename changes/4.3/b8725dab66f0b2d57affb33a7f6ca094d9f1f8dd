clocksource/drivers/samsung_pwm_timer: Prevent ftrace recursion

Currently samsung_pwm_timer can be used as a scheduler clock. We properly
marked samsung_read_sched_clock() as notrace but we then call another
function samsung_clocksource_read() that _wasn't_ notrace.

Having a traceable function in the sched_clock() path leads to a recursion
within ftrace and a kernel crash.

Fix this by adding notrace attribute to the samsung_clocksource_read()
function.
