drm/amdgpu: modify amdgpu_fence_wait_any() to amdgpu_fence_wait_multiple()

Rename the function and update the related code with this modified function.
Add the new parameter of bool wait_all.

If wait_all is true, it will return when all fences are signaled or timeout.
If wait_all is false, it will return when any fence is signaled or timeout.
