cxl: abort cxl_pci_enable_device_hook() if PCI channel is offline

cxl_pci_enable_device_hook() is called when attempting to enable an AFU
sitting on a vPHB. At present, the state of the underlying CXL card's PCI
channel is only checked when it calls cxl_afu_check_and_enable() at the
very end, after it has already set DMA options and initialised a default
context.

Check the CXL card's link status before setting DMA options or initialising
a default context. If the link is down, print a warning and return
immediately.
