dmaengine: dw: properly read DWC_PARAMS register

In case we have less than maximum allowed channels (8) and autoconfiguration is
enabled the DWC_PARAMS read is wrong because it uses different arithmetic to
what is needed for channel priority setup.

Re-do the caclulations properly. This now works on AVR32 board well.
