macvtap: unbreak receiving of gro skb with frag list

We don't have fraglist support in TAP_FEATURES. This will lead
software segmentation of gro skb with frag list. Fixes by having
frag list support in TAP_FEATURES.

With this patch single session of netperf receiving were restored from
about 5Gb/s to about 12Gb/s on mlx4.
