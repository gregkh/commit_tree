drm/i915: Don't dereference NULL plane while setting up scalers

intel_atomic_setup_scalers() dereferences 'plane' before the plane has
been assigned.  The plane ID assignment doing this dereference is only
needed for debugging messages later in the function, so just move the
assignment farther down the function to a point where plane will no
longer be NULL.

This was introduced in:
