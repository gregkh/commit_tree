drm: Make the connector dpms callback return a value, v2.

This is required to properly handle failing dpms calls.
When making a wait in i915 interruptible, I've noticed
that the dpms sequence could fail with -ERESTARTSYS because
it was waiting interruptibly for flips. So from now on
allow drivers to fail in their connector dpms callback.

Encoder and crtc dpms callbacks are unaffected.

Changes since v1:
- Update kerneldoc for the drm helper functions.
