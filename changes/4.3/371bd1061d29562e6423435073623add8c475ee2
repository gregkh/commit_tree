geneve: Consolidate Geneve functionality in single module.

geneve_core module handles send and receive functionality.
This way OVS could use the Geneve API. Now with use of
tunnel meatadata mode OVS can directly use Geneve netdevice.
So there is no need for separate module for Geneve. Following
patch consolidates Geneve protocol processing in single module.
