mmc: sdhci: add quirk SDHCI_QUIRK2_NEED_DELAY_AFTER_INT_CLK_RST

The Atmel sdhci device needs a new quirk. sdhci_set_clock set the Clock
Control Register to 0 before computing the new value and writing it.
It disables the internal clock which causes a reset mecanism. If we
write the new value before this reset mecanism is done, it will prevent
the stabilisation of the internal clock, so a delay is needed. This
delay is about 2-3 cycles of the base clock. To be safe, a 1 ms delay is
used.
