mlxsw: Simplify mlxsw_sx_port_xmit function

Previously we only checked if the transmission queue is not full in the
middle of the xmit function. This lead to complex logic due to the fact
that sometimes we need to reallocate the headroom for our Tx header.

Allow the switch driver to know if the transmission queue is not full
before sending the packet and remove this complex logic.
