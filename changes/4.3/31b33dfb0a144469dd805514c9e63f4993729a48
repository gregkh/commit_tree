skbuff: Fix skb checksum partial check.

Earlier patch 6ae459bda tried to detect void ckecksum partial
skb by comparing pull length to checksum offset. But it does
not work for all cases since checksum-offset depends on
updates to skb->data.

Following patch fixes it by validating checksum start offset
after skb-data pointer is updated. Negative value of checksum
offset start means there is no need to checksum.
