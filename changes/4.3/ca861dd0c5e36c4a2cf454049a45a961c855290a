spi: bcm2835: set up spi-mode before asserting cs-gpio

When using reverse polarity for clock (spi-cpol) on a device
the clock line gets altered after chip-select has been asserted
resulting in an additional clock beat, which confuses hardware.

This did not show when using native-CS, as the same register
is used to control cs as well as polarity, so the changes came
into effect at the same time. Unfortunately this is not true
with gpio-cs.

To avoid this situation this patch moves the setup of polarity
(spi-cpol and spi-cpha) outside of the chip-select into
prepare_message, which is run prior to asserting chip-select.

Also fixes resetting 3-wire mode after use of rx-mode, so that
a 3-Wire sequence TX, RX, TX works as well (right now it runs
TX, RX, RX instead)
