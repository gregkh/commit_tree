timekeeping: Increment clock_was_set_seq in timekeeping_init()

timekeeping_init() can set the wall time offset, so we need to
increment the clock_was_set_seq counter. That way hrtimers will pick
up the early offset immediately. Otherwise on a machine which does not
set wall time later in the boot process the hrtimer offset is stale at
0 and wall time timers are going to expire with a delay of 45 years.
