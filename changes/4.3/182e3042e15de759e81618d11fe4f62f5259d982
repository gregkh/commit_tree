openvswitch: Allow matching on conntrack mark

Allow matching and setting the ct_mark field. As with ct_state and
ct_zone, these fields are populated when the CT action is executed. To
write to this field, a value and mask can be specified as a nested
attribute under the CT action. This data is stored with the conntrack
entry, and is executed after the lookup occurs for the CT action. The
conntrack entry itself must be committed using the COMMIT flag in the CT
action flags for this change to persist.
