rcu: Limit rcu_capacity[] size to RCU_NUM_LVLS items

Number of items in rcu_capacity[] array is defined by macro
MAX_RCU_LVLS. However, that array is never accessed beyond
RCU_NUM_LVLS index. Therefore, we can limit the array to
RCU_NUM_LVLS items and eliminate MAX_RCU_LVLS. As result,
in most cases the memory is conserved.
