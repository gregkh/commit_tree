ASoC: max98095: Get rid of max98095_access table

The max98095_access table is used for look up readable/writable
attributes of registers. The readable/writable/volatile registers are
mostly in continuous ranges, so we can replace the max98095_access table
entirely by using case range.

Below is a summary of the readable/writeable/volatile registers:

readable registers:
        0x01 ~ 0x97, 0xFF
writeable registers:
        0x0F ~ 0x97
volatile registers:
        0x00 ~ 0x0E, 0x98 ~ 0xFF

This patch reworks the implement for .readable and .volatile and also add
implementation for .writable callback.
