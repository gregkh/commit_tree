i40e: provide correct API version to older VF drivers

This driver fully supports VF drivers using both the 1.0 and 1.1
versions of the virtual channel API. However, VF drivers using
version 1.0 get upset if we provide them with a version other than
that, and refuse to play with us.

Correct this by checking the VFs API version at the time that we
store it off, and provide the correct version number back to the VF
so we can all get along.
