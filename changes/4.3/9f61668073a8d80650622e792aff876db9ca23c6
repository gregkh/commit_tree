tracing: Allow triggers to filter for CPU ids and process names

By extending the filter rules by more generic fields
we can write triggers filters like

  echo 'stacktrace if cpu == 1' > \
	/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/raw_syscalls/sys_enter/trigger

or

  echo 'stacktrace if comm == sshd'  > \
	/sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/raw_syscalls/sys_enter/trigger

CPU and COMM are not part of struct trace_entry. We could add the two
new fields to ftrace_common_field list and fix up all depending
sides. But that looks pretty ugly. Another thing I would like to
avoid that the 'format' file contents changes.

All this can be avoided by introducing another list which contains
non field members of struct trace_entry.
