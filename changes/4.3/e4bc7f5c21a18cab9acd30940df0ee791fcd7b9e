mpt3sas: Don't block the drive when drive addition under the control of SML

During hot-plugging of a disk(having a flaky link), the disk addition
stops and any further disk addition or removal doesn't happen on that
controller.

This is because, when driver receives DELAY_NOT_RESPONDING event for a disk
while it is undergoing addition at the SCSI Transport layer, the driver
would block the I/O to that disk resulting in a deadlock. i.e the disk
addition work couldn't be completed at the SCSI Transport Layer as it
can't send any I/Os (such as Inquiry, Report LUNs etc) to the disk as
I/Os are blocked to this drive. Also any subsequent device removal
(TARGET_NOT_RESPONDING) or link update(RC_PHY_CHANGED) event couldn't be
processed as they are in the queue to get processed after disk addition
event.

Description of Change:
Don't block the drive when drive addition is under the control of SML.
So that SML won't be blocked of issuing the device dicovery commands
(such as Inquiry, Report LUNs etc).
