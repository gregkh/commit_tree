ASoC: dwc: fix dma stop transferring issue

Designware I2S uses tx empty and rx available signals as the DMA
handshaking signals. during music playing, if XRUN occurs,
i2s_stop() function will be executed and both tx and rx irq are
masked, when music continues to be played, i2s_start() is executed
but both tx and rx irq are not unmasked which cause I2S stop
sending DMA handshaking signal to DMA controller, and it finally
causes music playing will be stopped once XRUN occurs for the first
time.

[On list discussion suggests this may be partly a race condition on slow
systems -- broonie]
