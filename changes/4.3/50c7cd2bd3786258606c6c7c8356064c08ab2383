dmaengine: Add scatter-gathered memset

The current API allows the driver to accelerate memset by using the DMA
controller.

However, it does so over a contiguous memory area, which might proves
inefficient when you have to do it over a non-contiguous yet repititive
pattern, since you have to create a number of descriptors and then submit
each other.

Add a memset operation going over a scatter list to handle such cases in a
single call.
