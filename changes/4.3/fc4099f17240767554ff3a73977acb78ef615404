openvswitch: Fix egress tunnel info.

While transitioning to netdev based vport we broke OVS
feature which allows user to retrieve tunnel packet egress
information for lwtunnel devices.  Following patch fixes it
by introducing ndo operation to get the tunnel egress info.
Same ndo operation can be used for lwtunnel devices and compat
ovs-tnl-vport devices. So after adding such device operation
we can remove similar operation from ovs-vport.

Fixes: 614732eaa12d ("openvswitch: Use regular VXLAN net_device device").
