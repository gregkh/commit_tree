arm64: alternatives: ensure secondary CPUs execute ISB after patching

In order to guarantee that the patched instruction stream is visible to
a CPU, that CPU must execute an isb instruction after any related cache
maintenance has completed.

The instruction patching routines in kernel/insn.c get this right for
things like jump labels and ftrace, but the alternatives patching omits
it entirely leaving secondary cores in a potential limbo between the old
and the new code.

This patch adds an isb following the secondary polling loop in the
altenatives patching.
