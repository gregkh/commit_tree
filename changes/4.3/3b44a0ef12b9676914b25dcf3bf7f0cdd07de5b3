iwlwifi: mvm: remove partial and full scan lists from lmac sched scan

Lmac sched scan supports partial scans, so we can set some channels to be
scanned on every scan iteration and others to be scanned only on some
iterations. Currently we set all channels to be scanned every iteration,
but still have some configuration of which iterations should be partial
and which should be full.

Remove all partial/full scan configuration to reduce confusions.
