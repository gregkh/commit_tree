soc: renesas: rmobile-sysc: Remove unneeded platform includes

As of commit b587288001f05c0e ("ARM: shmobile: R-Mobile: Remove legacy
PM Domain code"), the R-Mobile System Controller driver no longer
handles the adding of platform devices to PM Domains, but delegates that
to the PM Domain core code.
