ALSA: hda/realtek: Re-order remaining ALC269 quirk table entries

Just re-order the alc269_fixup_tbl[] entries for FSC, Medion, Samsung
and Lemote devices for avoiding the oversight of the duplicated or
unapplied item in future.
No functional changes.

Also Cc-to-stable for the further patch applications.
