scsi: smartpqi: Update device scan operations

Change return type from EINPROGRESS to EBUSY to signal applications to
retry a REGNEWD if the driver cannot process the REGNEWD. Events such as
OFA, suspend, and shutdown return EINPROGRESS if a scan is currently
running. This prevents applications from immediately retrying REGNEWD.

Schedule a new REGNEWD if system low on memory.
