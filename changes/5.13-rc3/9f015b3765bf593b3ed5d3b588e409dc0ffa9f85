tee: amdtee: unload TA only when its refcount becomes 0

Same Trusted Application (TA) can be loaded in multiple TEE contexts.

If it is a single instance TA, the TA should not get unloaded from AMD
Secure Processor, while it is still in use in another TEE context.

Therefore reference count TA and unload it when the count becomes zero.
