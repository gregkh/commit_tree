net: phy: marvell10g: support other MACTYPEs

Currently the only "changing" MACTYPE we support is when the PHY changes
between
  10gbase-r / 5gbase-r / 2500base-x / sgmii

Add support for
  usxgmii
  xaui / 5gbase-r / 2500base-x / sgmii
  rxaui / 5gbase-r / 2500base-x / sgmii
and also
  5gbase-r / 2500base-x / sgmii
for 88E2110.
