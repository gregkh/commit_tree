Revert "media: rcar_drif: fix a memory disclosure"

This reverts commit d39083234c60519724c6ed59509a2129fd2aed41.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, it was determined that this commit is not needed at all as
the media core already prevents memory disclosure on this codepath, so
just drop the extra memset happening here.
