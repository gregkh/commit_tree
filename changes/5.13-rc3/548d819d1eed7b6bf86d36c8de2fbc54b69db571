io_uring: allow SQPOLL without CAP_SYS_ADMIN or CAP_SYS_NICE

Now that we have any worker being attached to the original task as
threads, accounting of CPU time is directly attributed to the original
task as well. This means that we no longer have to restrict SQPOLL to
needing elevated privileges, as it's really no different from just having
the task spawn a busy looping thread in userspace.
