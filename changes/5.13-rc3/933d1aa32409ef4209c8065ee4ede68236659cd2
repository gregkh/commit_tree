libbpf: Refactor bpf_object__resolve_ksyms_btf_id

This patch refactors most of the logic from
bpf_object__resolve_ksyms_btf_id() into a new function
bpf_object__resolve_ksym_var_btf_id().
It is to get ready for a later patch adding
bpf_object__resolve_ksym_func_btf_id() which resolves
a kernel function to the running kernel btf_id.
