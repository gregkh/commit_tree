libbpf: Make few internal helpers available outside of libbpf.c

Make skip_mods_and_typedefs(), btf_kind_str(), and btf_func_linkage() helpers
available outside of libbpf.c, to be used by static linker code.

Also do few cleanups (error code fixes, comment clean up, etc) that don't
deserve their own commit.
