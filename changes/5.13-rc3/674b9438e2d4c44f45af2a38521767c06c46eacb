ASoC: audio-graph: count DAI / link numbers as in order

audio-graph checks DT links 2 times. 1st is for counting DAIs / links
to allocating memory, 2nd is for detecting DAIs.
To detecting DAIs as CPU-dummy -> dummy-Codec order when DPCM case,
it uses loops 2 times at 2nd DT link check.
But it doesn't do it at 1st DT link check.

	for (li.cpu = 1; li.cpu >= 0; li.cpu--) {
		/*
		 * Detect all CPU first, and Detect all Codec 2n
		 *
		 * In Normal sound case, all DAIs are detected
		 * as "CPU-Codec".
		 *
		 * In DPCM sound case,
		 * all CPUs   are detected as "CPU-dummy", and
		 * all Codecs are detected as "dummy-Codec".
		 * To avoid random sub-device numbering,
		 * detect "dummy-Codec" in last;
		 */
		ret = graph_for_each_link(...);
		...
	}

To prepare supporting multi-CPU/Codec, and code cleanup,
this patch use same loop for 1st DT link check, too.
