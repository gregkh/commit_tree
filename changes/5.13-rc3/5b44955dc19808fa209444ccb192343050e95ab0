irqchip/apple-aic: APPLE_AIC should depend on ARCH_APPLE

The Apple Interrupt Controller is only present on Apple Silicon SoCs.
Hence add a dependency on ARCH_APPLE, to prevent asking the user about
this driver when configuring a kernel without Apple Silicon SoC support.

Drop the default, as ARCH_APPLE already selects APPLE_AIC.
