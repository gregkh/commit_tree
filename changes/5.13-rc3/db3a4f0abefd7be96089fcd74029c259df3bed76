misc/pvpanic: add PCI driver

Add support for pvpanic PCI device added in qemu [1]. At probe time, obtain the
address where to read/write pvpanic events and pass it to the generic handling
code. Will follow the same logic as pvpanic MMIO device driver. At remove time,
unmap base address and disable PCI device.
