powerpc/iommu: Enable remaining IOMMU Pagesizes present in LoPAR

According to LoPAR, ibm,query-pe-dma-window output named "IO Page Sizes"
will let the OS know all possible pagesizes that can be used for creating a
new DDW.

Currently Linux will only try using 3 of the 8 available options:
4K, 64K and 16M. According to LoPAR, Hypervisor may also offer 32M, 64M,
128M, 256M and 16G.

Enabling bigger pages would be interesting for direct mapping systems
with a lot of RAM, while using less TCE entries.
