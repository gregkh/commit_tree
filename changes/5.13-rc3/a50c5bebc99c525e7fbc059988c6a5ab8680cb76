x86/sev-es: Invalidate the GHCB after completing VMGEXIT

Since the VMGEXIT instruction can be issued from userspace, invalidate
the GHCB after performing VMGEXIT processing in the kernel.

Invalidation is only required after userspace is available, so call
vc_ghcb_invalidate() from sev_es_put_ghcb(). Update vc_ghcb_invalidate()
to additionally clear the GHCB exit code so that it is always presented
as 0 when VMGEXIT has been issued by anything else besides the kernel.
