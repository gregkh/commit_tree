io_uring: optimise io_req_task_work_add()

Inline io_task_work_add() into io_req_task_work_add(). They both work
with a request, so keeping them separate doesn't make things much more
clear, but merging allows optimise it. Apart from small wins like not
reading req->ctx or not calculating @notify in the hot path, i.e. with
tctx->task_state set, it avoids doing wake_up_process() for every single
add, but only after actually done task_work_add().
