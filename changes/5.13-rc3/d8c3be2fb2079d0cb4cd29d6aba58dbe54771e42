Revert "media: gspca: mt9m111: Check write_bridge for timeout"

This reverts commit 656025850074f5c1ba2e05be37bda57ba2b8d491.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

Different error values should never be "OR" together and expect anything
sane to come out of the result.
