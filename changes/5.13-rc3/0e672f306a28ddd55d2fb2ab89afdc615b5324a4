veth: check for NAPI instead of xdp_prog before xmit of XDP frame

The recent patch that tied enabling of veth NAPI to the GRO flag also has
the nice side effect that a veth device can be the target of an
XDP_REDIRECT without an XDP program needing to be loaded on the peer
device. However, the patch adding this extra NAPI mode didn't actually
change the check in veth_xdp_xmit() to also look at the new NAPI pointer,
so let's fix that.
