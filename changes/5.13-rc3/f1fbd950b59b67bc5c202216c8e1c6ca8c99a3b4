usb: typec: tcpm: Fix wrong handling for Not_Supported in VDM AMS

Not_Supported Message is acceptable in VDM AMS. Redirect the VDM state
machine to VDM_STATE_DONE when receiving Not_Supported and finish the
VDM AMS.

Also, after the loop in vdm_state_machine_work, add more conditions of
VDM states to clear the vdm_sm_running flag because those are all
stopping states when leaving the loop.

In addition, finish the VDM AMS if the port partner responds BUSY.
