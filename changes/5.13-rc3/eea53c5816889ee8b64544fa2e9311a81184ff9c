iommu/vt-d: Remove WO permissions on second-level paging entries

When the first level page table is used for IOVA translation, it only
supports Read-Only and Read-Write permissions. The Write-Only permission
is not supported as the PRESENT bit (implying Read permission) should
always set. When using second level, we still give separate permissions
that allows WriteOnly which seems inconsistent and awkward. We want to
have consistent behavior. After moving to 1st level, we don't want things
to work sometimes, and break if we use 2nd level for the same mappings.
Hence remove this configuration.
