arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: trogdor: Use ADC TM channel 0 instead of 1 for charger temperature

On trogdor the ADC thermal monitor is used for monitoring certain
device temperatures. All trogdor boards have at least a thermistor
for the charger temperature, optionally they may have others.

Currently the ADC thermal monitor is configured to use channel 1
for the charger temperature. Given that all trogdor boards have
the charger thermistor it makes more sense to use channel 0,
and then let boards with other thermistors use channels 1, 2, 3,
rather than 0, 2, 3.
