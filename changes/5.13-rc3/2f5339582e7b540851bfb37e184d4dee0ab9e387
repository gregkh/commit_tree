arch_topology: Export arch_freq_scale and helpers

It is possible now for other parts of the kernel to provide their own
implementation of sched_freq_tick() and they can very well be modules
themselves (like CPPC cpufreq driver, which is going to use these in a
later commit).

Export arch_freq_scale and topology_{set|clear}_scale_freq_source().
