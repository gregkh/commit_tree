iio:imu:adis: Use IRQF_NO_AUTOEN instead of irq request then disable

This is a bit involved as the adis library code already has some
sanity checking of the flags of the requested irq that we need
to ensure is happy to pass through the IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag untouched.

Using this flag avoids us autoenabling the irq in the adis16460 and
adis16475 drivers which cover parts that don't have any means of
masking the interrupt on the device end.

Note, compile tested only!
