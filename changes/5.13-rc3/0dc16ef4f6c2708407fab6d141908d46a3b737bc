btrfs: zoned: fix unpaired block group unfreeze during device replace

When doing a device replace on a zoned filesystem, if we find a block
group with ->to_copy == 0, we jump to the label 'done', which will result
in later calling btrfs_unfreeze_block_group(), even though at this point
we never called btrfs_freeze_block_group().

Since at this point we have neither turned the block group to RO mode nor
made any progress, we don't need to jump to the label 'done'. So fix this
by jumping instead to the label 'skip' and dropping our reference on the
block group before the jump.
