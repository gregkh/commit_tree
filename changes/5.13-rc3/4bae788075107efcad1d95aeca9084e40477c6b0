btrfs: add and use helper to get lowest sequence number for the tree mod log

There are two places outside the tree mod log module that extract the
lowest sequence number of the tree mod log. These places end up
duplicating code and open coding the logic and internal implementation
details of the tree mod log. So add a helper to the tree mod log module
and header that returns the lowest sequence number or 0 if there aren't
any tree mod log users at the moment.
