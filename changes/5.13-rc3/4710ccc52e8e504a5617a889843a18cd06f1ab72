dt-bindings: media: renesas,drif: Use graph schema

Convert the renesas,drif binding schema to use the graph schema. The
binding referred to video-interfaces.txt, but it doesn't actually use any
properties from it as 'sync-active' is a custom property. As 'sync-active'
is custom, it needs a type definition.
