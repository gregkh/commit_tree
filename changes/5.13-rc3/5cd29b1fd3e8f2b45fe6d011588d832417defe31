powerpc/uaccess: Use asm goto for get_user when compiler supports it

clang 11 and future GCC are supporting asm goto with outputs.

Use it to implement get_user in order to get better generated code.

Note that clang requires to set x in the default branch of
__get_user_size_goto() otherwise is compliant about x not being
initialised :puzzled:
