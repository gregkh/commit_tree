arm64: arch_timer: Implement support for interrupt-names

This allows the devicetree to correctly represent the available set of
timers, which varies from device to device, without the need for fake
dummy interrupts for unavailable slots.

Also add the hyp-virt timer/PPI, which is not currently used, but worth
representing.
