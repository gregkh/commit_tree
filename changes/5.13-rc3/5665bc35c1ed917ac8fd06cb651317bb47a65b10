powerpc/64s/syscall: Use pt_regs.trap to distinguish syscall ABI difference between sc and scv syscalls

The sc and scv 0 system calls have different ABI conventions, and
ptracers need to know which system call type is being used if they want
to look at the syscall registers.

Document that pt_regs.trap can be used for this, and fix one in-tree user
to work with scv 0 syscalls.
