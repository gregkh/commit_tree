powerpc/pseries: extract host bridge from pci_bus prior to bus removal

The pci_bus->bridge reference may no longer be valid after
pci_bus_remove() resulting in passing a bad value to device_unregister()
for the associated bridge device.

Store the host_bridge reference in a separate variable prior to
pci_bus_remove().
