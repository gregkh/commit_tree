pinctrl: Ingenic: Improve LCD pins related code.

1.In the JZ4740 part, remove pointless "lcd-no-pins", use "lcd-special"
  and "lcd-generic" instead "lcd-18bit-tft". Currently, in the mainline,
  no other devicetree out there is using the "lcd-18bit-tft" ABI, so we
  should be able to replace it safely.
2.In the JZ4725B part, adjust the location of the LCD pins related code
  to keep them consistent with the style of other parts.
3.In the JZ4760 part, add the missing comma and adjust element order in
  "jz4760_lcd_special_pins[]", keep them in the order of CLS/SPL/PS/REV
  like other "lcd_special_pins" arrays. And adjust the location of the
  "jz4760_lcd_generic" related code to keep them consistent with the
  style of other parts.
4.In the JZ4770 part, remove pointless "lcd-no-pins", add the missing
  "lcd-16bit", "lcd-18bit", "lcd-special", "lcd-generic".
5.In the X1000 part and the X1500 part, remove pointless "lcd-no-pins".
6.In the X1830 part, replace "lcd-rgb-18bit" with "lcd-tft-8bit" and
  "lcd-tft-24bit", because of the description of the TRANS_CONFIG.MODE
  register bits in the PM manual of the X1830, shows that the X1830 only
  supppots 24bit mode and 8bit mode for tft interface, only 18 pins in
  the GPIO table are because of the data[17:16], the data[9:8], and the
  data[1:0] has not been connected. And according to the description,
  the two interfaces supported by X1830 are respectively referred to as
  "TFT interface" and "SLCD interface", so the "lcd-rgb-xxx" is replaced
  with "lcd-tft-xxx" to avoid confusion.
