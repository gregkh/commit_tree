KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Fix some error codes when setting RDIST base

KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_ADDR group doc says we should return
-EEXIST in case the base address of the redist is already set.
We currently return -EINVAL.

However we need to return -EINVAL in case a legacy REDIST address
is attempted to be set while REDIST_REGIONS were set. This case
is discriminated by looking at the count field.
