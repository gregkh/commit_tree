net: renesas: ravb: Fix a stuck issue when a lot of frames are received

When a lot of frames were received in the short term, the driver
caused a stuck of receiving until a new frame was received. For example,
the following command from other device could cause this issue.

    $ sudo ping -f -l 1000 -c 1000 <this driver's ipaddress>

The previous code always cleared the interrupt flag of RX but checks
the interrupt flags in ravb_poll(). So, ravb_poll() could not call
ravb_rx() in the next time until a new RX frame was received if
ravb_rx() returned true. To fix the issue, always calls ravb_rx()
regardless the interrupt flags condition.
