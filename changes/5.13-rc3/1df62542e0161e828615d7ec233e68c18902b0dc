gpiolib: Move of_node operations to gpiolib-of and correct fwnode use

The initial value of the OF node based on presence of parent, but
at the same time this operation somehow appeared separately from others
that handle the OF case. On the other hand there is no need to assign
dev->fwnode in the OF case if code properly retrieves fwnode, i.e.
via dev_fwnode() helper.

Amend gpiolib.c and gpiolib-of.c code in order to group OF operations.
