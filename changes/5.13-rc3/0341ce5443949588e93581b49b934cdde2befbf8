workqueue: Add resource managed version of delayed work init

A few drivers which need a delayed work-queue must cancel work at driver
detach. Some of those implement remove() solely for this purpose. Help
drivers to avoid unnecessary remove and error-branch implementation by
adding managed verision of delayed work initialization. This will also
help drivers to avoid mixing manual and devm based unwinding when other
resources are handled by devm.
