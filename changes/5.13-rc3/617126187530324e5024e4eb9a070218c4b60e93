drm/bridge/ti-sn65dsi86: (Un)register aux device on bridge attach/detach

Since we're about to add a back-pointer to drm_dev in drm_dp_aux, let's
move the AUX adapter registration to the first point where we know which
DRM device we'll be working with - when the drm_bridge is attached.
Likewise, we unregister the AUX adapter on bridge detachment by adding a
ti_sn_bridge_detach() callback.
