Input: elants_i2c - do not bind to i2c-hid compatible ACPI instantiated devices

Several users have been reporting that elants_i2c gives several errors
during probe and that their touchscreen does not work on their Lenovo AMD
based laptops with a touchscreen with a ELAN0001 ACPI hardware-id:

Despite these errors, the elants_i2c driver stays bound to the device
(it returns 0 from its probe method despite the errors), blocking the
i2c-hid driver from binding.

Manually unbinding the elants_i2c driver and binding the i2c-hid driver
makes the touchscreen work.

Check if the ACPI-fwnode for the touchscreen contains one of the i2c-hid
compatiblity-id strings and if it has the I2C-HID spec's DSM to get the
HID descriptor address, If it has both then make elants_i2c not bind,
so that the i2c-hid driver can bind.

This assumes that non of the (older) elan touchscreens which actually
need the elants_i2c driver falsely advertise an i2c-hid compatiblity-id
+ DSM in their ACPI-fwnodes. If some of them actually do have this
false advertising, then this change may lead to regressions.

While at it also drop the unnecessary DEVICE_NAME prefixing of the
"I2C check functionality error", dev_err already outputs the driver-name.
