usb: dwc2: Add device clock gating support functions

Added device clock gating support functions according
programming guide.

Moved "bus_suspended" flag to "dwc2_hsotg" struct because
we need to set that flag while entering to clock gating
in case when the driver is built in peripheral mode.

Added function names:
dwc2_gadget_enter_clock_gating()
dwc2_gadget_exit_clock_gating()
