mm: replace migrate_[prep|finish] with lru_cache_[disable|enable]

Currently, migrate_[prep|finish] is merely a wrapper of
lru_cache_[disable|enable].  There is not much to gain from having
additional abstraction.

Use lru_cache_[disable|enable] instead of migrate_[prep|finish], which
would be more descriptive.

note: migrate_prep_local in compaction.c changed into lru_add_drain to
avoid CPU schedule cost with involving many other CPUs to keep old
behavior.
