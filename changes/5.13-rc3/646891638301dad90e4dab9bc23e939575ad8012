tty: serial: samsung_tty: Separate S3C64XX ops structure

Instead of patching a single global ops structure depending on the port
type, use a separate s3c64xx_serial_ops for the S3C64XX type. This
allows us to mark the structures as const.

Also split out s3c64xx_serial_shutdown into a separate function now that
we have a separate ops structure; this avoids excessive branching
control flow and mirrors s3c64xx_serial_startup. tx_claimed and
rx_claimed are only used in the S3C24XX functions.
