KVM: SVM: Move GHCB unmapping to fix RCU warning

When an SEV-ES guest is running, the GHCB is unmapped as part of the
vCPU run support. However, kvm_vcpu_unmap() triggers an RCU dereference
warning with CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y because the SRCU lock is released
before invoking the vCPU run support.

Move the GHCB unmapping into the prepare_guest_switch callback, which is
invoked while still holding the SRCU lock, eliminating the RCU dereference
warning.
