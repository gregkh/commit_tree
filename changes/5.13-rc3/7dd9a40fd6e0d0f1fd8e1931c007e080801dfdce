ath9k: Fix error check in ath9k_hw_read_revisions() for PCI devices

When the error check in ath9k_hw_read_revisions() was added, it checked for
-EIO which is what ath9k_regread() in the ath9k_htc driver uses. However,
for plain ath9k, the register read function uses ioread32(), which just
returns -1 on error. So if such a read fails, it still gets passed through
and ends up as a weird mac revision in the log output.

Fix this by changing ath9k_regread() to return -1 on error like ioread32()
does, and fix the error check to look for that instead of -EIO.
