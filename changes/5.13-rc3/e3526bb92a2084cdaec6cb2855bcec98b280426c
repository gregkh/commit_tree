skmsg: Move sk_redir from TCP_SKB_CB to skb

Currently TCP_SKB_CB() is hard-coded in skmsg code, it certainly
does not work for any other non-TCP protocols. We can move them to
skb ext, but it introduces a memory allocation on fast path.

Fortunately, we only need to a word-size to store all the information,
because the flags actually only contains 1 bit so can be just packed
into the lowest bit of the "pointer", which is stored as unsigned
long.

Inside struct sk_buff, '_skb_refdst' can be reused because skb dst is
no longer needed after ->sk_data_ready() so we can just drop it.
