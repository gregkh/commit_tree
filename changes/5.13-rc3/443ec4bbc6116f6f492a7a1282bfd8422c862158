media: vivid: update EDID

The EDID had a few mistakes as reported by edid-decode:

Block 1, CTA-861 Extension Block:
  Video Data Block: For improved preferred timing interoperability, set 'Native detailed modes' to 1.
  Video Capability Data Block: S_PT is equal to S_IT and S_CE, so should be set to 0 instead.

Fixed those.
