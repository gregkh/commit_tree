netfilter: flowtable: add offload support for xmit path types

When the flow tuple xmit_type is set to FLOW_OFFLOAD_XMIT_DIRECT, the
dst_cache pointer is not valid, and the h_source/h_dest/ifidx out fields
need to be used.

This patch also adds the FLOW_ACTION_VLAN_PUSH action to pass the VLAN
tag to the driver.
