perf test: Add a shell test for 'perf stat --bpf-counters' new option

Add a test to compare the output of perf-stat with and without option
--bpf-counters. If the difference is more than 10%, the test is considered
as failed.

Committer testing:

  # perf test bpf-counters
  86: perf stat --bpf-counters test                                   : Ok
  # perf test -v bpf-counters
  86: perf stat --bpf-counters test                                   :
  --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 2433339
  test child finished with 0
  ---- end ----
  perf stat --bpf-counters test: Ok
