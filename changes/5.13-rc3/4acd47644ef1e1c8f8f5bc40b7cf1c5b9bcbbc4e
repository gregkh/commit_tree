MAINTAINERS: update

I am making this change again since I received the following instruction.

"As an IBM employee, you are not allowed to use your gmail account to work
in any way on VNIC. You are not allowed to use your personal email account
as a "hobby". You are an IBM employee 100% of the time.
Please remove yourself completely from the maintainers file.
I grant you a 1 time exception on contributions to VNIC to make this
change."
