ASoC: cs43130: handle errors in cs43130_probe() properly

cs43130_probe() does not do any valid error checking of things it
initializes, OR what it does, it does not unwind properly if there are
errors.

Fix this up by moving the sysfs files to an attribute group so the
driver core will correctly add/remove them all at once and handle errors
with them, and correctly check for creating a new workqueue and
unwinding if that fails.
