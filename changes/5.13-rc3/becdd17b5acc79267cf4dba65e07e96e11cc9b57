ktest: Adding editor hints to improve consistency

Emacs and Vi(m) have different styles of dealing with perl syntax
which can lead to slightly inconsistent indentation, and makes the
code slightly harder to read.  Emacs assumes a more perl recommended
standard of 4 spaces (1 column) or tab (two column) indentation.

Vi(m) tends to favor just normal spaces or tabs depending on what
was being used.

This gives the basic hinting to Emacs and Vim to do what is
expected to be basically consistent.

Emacs:
	- Explicitly flip into perl mode, cperl would require
	  more adjustments

Vi(m):
	- Set softtabs=4 which will flip it over to doing
	  indentation the way you would expect from Emacs
