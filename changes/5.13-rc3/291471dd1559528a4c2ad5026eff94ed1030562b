libbpf, xsk: Add libbpf_smp_store_release libbpf_smp_load_acquire

Now that the AF_XDP rings have load-acquire/store-release semantics,
move libbpf to that as well.

The library-internal libbpf_smp_{load_acquire,store_release} are only
valid for 32-bit words on ARM64.

Also, remove the barriers that are no longer in use.
