KVM: SVM: Do not allow SEV/SEV-ES initialization after vCPUs are created

Reject KVM_SEV_INIT and KVM_SEV_ES_INIT if they are attempted after one
or more vCPUs have been created.  KVM assumes a VM is tagged SEV/SEV-ES
prior to vCPU creation, e.g. init_vmcb() needs to mark the VMCB as SEV
enabled, and svm_create_vcpu() needs to allocate the VMSA.  At best,
creating vCPUs before SEV/SEV-ES init will lead to unexpected errors
and/or behavior, and at worst it will crash the host, e.g.
sev_launch_update_vmsa() will dereference a null svm->vmsa pointer.
