dma-mapping: refactor dma_{alloc,free}_pages

Factour out internal versions without the dma_debug calls in preparation
for callers that will need different dma_debug calls.

Note that this changes the dma_debug calls to get the not page aligned
size values, but as long as alloc and free agree on one variant we are
fine.
