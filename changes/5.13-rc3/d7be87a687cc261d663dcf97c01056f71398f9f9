net-sysfs: move the rtnl unlock up in the xps show helpers

Now that nr_ids and num_tc are stored in the xps dev_maps, which are RCU
protected, we do not have the need to protect the maps in the rtnl lock.
Move the rtnl unlock up so we reduce the rtnl locking section.

We also increase the reference count on the subordinate device if any,
as we don't want this device to be freed while we use it (now that the
rtnl lock isn't protecting it in the whole function).
