KVM: arm64: Move SPE availability check to VCPU load

At the moment, we check the availability of SPE on the given
CPU (i.e, SPE is implemented and is allowed at the host) during
every guest entry. This can be optimized a bit by moving the
check to vcpu_load time and recording the availability of the
feature on the current CPU via a new flag. This will also be useful
for adding the TRBE support.
