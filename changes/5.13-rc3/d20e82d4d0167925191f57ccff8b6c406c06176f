bus: mhi: core: Identify Flash Programmer as a mission mode use case

MHI power up can go through an EDL to Flash Programmer path when
the device has a blank NAND. In those cases, mhi_sync_power_up()
can timeout waiting for a mission mode execution environment.
Allow a successful power up instead by identifying Flash
Programmer as a valid mission mode execution environment with a
purpose to flash the device image contents.
