serial: meson: drop low-latency workaround

The meson driver has always carried an unnecessary workaround for the
infamous low_latency behaviour of tty_flip_buffer_push(), which had
already been removed by the time the driver was added by commit
ff7693d079e5 ("ARM: meson: serial: add MesonX SoC on-chip uart driver").

Specifically, since commit a9c3f68f3cd8 ("tty: Fix low_latency BUG"),
tty_flip_buffer_push() always schedules a work item to push data to the
line discipline and there's no need to keep any low_latency hacks around.
