ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Fix HP Pavilion x2 10-p0XX OVCD current threshold

When I added the quirk for the "HP Pavilion x2 10-p0XX" I copied the
byt_rt5640_quirk_table[] entry for the HP Pavilion x2 10-k0XX / 10-n0XX
models since these use almost the same settings.

While doing this I accidentally also copied and kept the non-standard
OVCD_TH_1500UA setting used on those models. This too low threshold is
causing headsets to often be seen as headphones (without a headset-mic)
and when correctly identified it is causing ghost play/pause
button-presses to get detected.

Correct the HP Pavilion x2 10-p0XX quirk to use the default OVCD_TH_2000UA
setting, fixing these problems.
