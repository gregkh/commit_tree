powerpc: Move copy_inst_from_kernel_nofault()

When probe_kernel_read_inst() was created, there was no good place to
put it, so a file called lib/inst.c was dedicated for it.

Since then, probe_kernel_read_inst() has been renamed
copy_inst_from_kernel_nofault(). And mm/maccess.h didn't exist at that
time. Today, mm/maccess.h is related to copy_from_kernel_nofault().

Move copy_inst_from_kernel_nofault() into mm/maccess.c
