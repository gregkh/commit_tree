perf/x86/intel/uncore: Generic support for the MMIO type of uncore blocks

The discovery table provides the generic uncore block information
for the MMIO type of uncore blocks, which is good enough to provide
basic uncore support.

The box control field is composed of the BAR address and box control
offset. When initializing the uncore blocks, perf should ioremap the
address from the box control field.

Implement the generic support for the MMIO type of uncore block.
