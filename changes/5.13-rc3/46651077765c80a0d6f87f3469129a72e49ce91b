Revert "libertas: add checks for the return value of sysfs_create_group"

This reverts commit 434256833d8eb988cb7f3b8a41699e2fe48d9332.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original commit was incorrect, the error needs to be propagated back
to the caller AND if the second group call fails, the first needs to be
removed.  There are much better ways to solve this, the driver should
NOT be calling sysfs_create_group() on its own as it is racing userspace
and loosing.
