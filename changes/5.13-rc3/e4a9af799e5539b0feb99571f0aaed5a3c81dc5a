crypto: ccp: Use the stack for small SEV command buffers

For commands with small input/output buffers, use the local stack to
"allocate" the structures used to communicate with the PSP.   Now that
__sev_do_cmd_locked() gracefully handles vmalloc'd buffers, there's no
reason to avoid using the stack, e.g. CONFIG_VMAP_STACK=y will just work.
