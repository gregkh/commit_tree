scsi: target: vhost-scsi: Convert to new submission API

target_submit_cmd_map_sgls() is being removed, so convert vhost-scsi to the
new submission API. This has it use target_init_cmd(),
target_submit_prep(), target_submit() because we need to have LIO core map
sgls which is now done in target_submit_prep(), and in the next patches we
will do the target_submit step from the LIO workqueue.

Note: vhost-scsi never calls target_stop_session() so
target_submit_cmd_map_sgls() never failed (in the new API target_init_cmd()
handles target_stop_session() being called when cmds are being
submitted). If it were to have used target_stop_session() and got an error,
we would have hit a refcount bug like xen and usb, because it does:

if (rc < 0) {
	transport_send_check_condition_and_sense(se_cmd,
			TCM_LOGICAL_UNIT_COMMUNICATION_FAILURE, 0);
	transport_generic_free_cmd(se_cmd, 0);
}

transport_send_check_condition_and_sense() calls queue_status which does
transport_generic_free_cmd(), and then we do an extra
transport_generic_free_cmd() call above which would have dropped the
refcount to -1 and the refcount code would spit out errors.
