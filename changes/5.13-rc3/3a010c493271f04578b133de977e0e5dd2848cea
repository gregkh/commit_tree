locking/mutex: clear MUTEX_FLAGS if wait_list is empty due to signal

When a interruptible mutex locker is interrupted by a signal
without acquiring this lock and removed from the wait queue.
if the mutex isn't contended enough to have a waiter
put into the wait queue again, the setting of the WAITER
bit will force mutex locker to go into the slowpath to
acquire the lock every time, so if the wait queue is empty,
the WAITER bit need to be clear.
