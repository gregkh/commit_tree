powerpc/64e/interrupt: Fix nvgprs being clobbered

Some interrupt handlers have an "extra" that saves 1 or 2
registers (r14, r15) in the paca save area and makes them available to
use by the handler.

The change to always save nvgprs in exception handlers lead to some
interrupt handlers saving those scratch r14 / r15 registers into the
interrupt frame's GPR saves, which get restored on interrupt exit.

Fix this by always reloading those scratch registers from paca before
the EXCEPTION_COMMON that saves nvgprs.
