dt-bindings: gpio: fairchild,74hc595: Convert to json-schema

Convert the Generic 8-bit shift register Device Tree binding
documentation to json-schema.

Rename from gpio-74x164 to fairchild,74hc595, as the former refers to
the Linux driver, and not to a hardware name.
Add the missing hog description.
