mmc: meson-gx: also check SD_IO_RW_EXTENDED for scatterlist size alignment

The brcmfmac driver can generate a scatterlist from a skb with each packets
not aligned to the block size. This is not supported by the Amlogic Descriptor
dma engine where each descriptor must match a multiple of the block size.

The sg list is valid, since the sum of the sg buffers is a multiple of the
block size, but we must discard those when in SD_IO_RW_EXTENDED mode since
SDIO block mode can be used under the hood even with data->blocks == 1.

Those transfers are very rare, thus can be replaced by a bounce buffer
without real performance loss.
