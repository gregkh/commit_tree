IB/cma: Introduce rdma_set_min_rnr_timer()

Introduce the ability for kernel ULPs to adjust the minimum RNR Retry
timer. The INIT -> RTR transition executed by RDMA CM will be used for
this adjustment. This avoids an additional ib_modify_qp() call.

rdma_set_min_rnr_timer() must be called before the call to rdma_connect()
on the active side and before the call to rdma_accept() on the passive
side.

The default value of RNR Retry timer is zero, which translates to 655
ms. When the receiver is not ready to accept a send messages, it encodes
the RNR Retry timer value in the NAK. The requestor will then wait at
least the specified time value before retrying the send.

The 5-bit value to be supplied to the rdma_set_min_rnr_timer() is
documented in IBTA Table 45: "Encoding for RNR NAK Timer Field".
