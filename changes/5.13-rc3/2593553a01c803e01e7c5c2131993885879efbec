io_uring: remove __io_req_task_cancel()

Both io_req_complete_failed() and __io_req_task_cancel() do the same
thing: set failure flag, put both req refs and emit an CQE. The former
one is a bit more advance as it puts req back into a req cache, so make
it to take over __io_req_task_cancel() and remove the last one.
