powerpc/mm: Move the linear_mapping_mutex to the ifdef where it is used

The mutex linear_mapping_mutex is defined at the of the file while its
only two user are within the CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG block.
A compile without CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG set fails on PREEMPT_RT because
its mutex implementation is smart enough to realize that it is unused.

Move the definition of linear_mapping_mutex to ifdef block where it is
used.
