bpf: Refactor check_func_call() to allow callback function

Later proposed bpf_for_each_map_elem() helper has callback
function as one of its arguments. This patch refactored
check_func_call() to permit callback function which sets
callee state. Different callback functions may have
different callee states.
There is no functionality change for this patch.
