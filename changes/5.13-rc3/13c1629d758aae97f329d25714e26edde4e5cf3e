ASoC: mchp-i2s-mcc: Add multi-channel support for I2S and LEFT_J formats

The latest I2S-MCC available in SAMA7G5 supports multi-channel for I2S and
Left-Justified formats. For this, the new version uses 8 (4 * 2) input and
output pins, with each pin being responsible for 2 channels. This sums up
to a total of 8 channels for synchronous capture and playback.
