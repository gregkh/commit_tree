security/loadpin: Update the changing interface in the source code.

Loadpin cmdline interface "enabled" has been renamed to "enforce"
for a long time, but the User Description Document was not updated.
(Meaning unchanged)

And kernel_read_file* were moved from linux/fs.h to its own
linux/kernel_read_file.h include file. So update that change here.
