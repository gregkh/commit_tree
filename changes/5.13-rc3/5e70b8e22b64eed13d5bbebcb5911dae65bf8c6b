ASoC: rt5645: add error checking to rt5645_probe function

Check for return value from various snd_soc_dapm_* calls, as many of
them can return errors and this should be handled. Also, reintroduce
the allocation failure check for rt5645->eq_param as well. Make all
areas where return values are checked lead to the end of the function
in the case of an error. Finally, introduce a comment explaining how
resources here are actually eventually cleaned up by the caller.
