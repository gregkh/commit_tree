staging: rtl8723bs: Remove unnecessary code

The same code is executed when the condition "!show_errors" is true or
false. Remove the if condition from here. The original intension of this
condition was to not to report any error logs if condition was true. But
this driver doesn't has those logs added. So this if condition can be
removed.
