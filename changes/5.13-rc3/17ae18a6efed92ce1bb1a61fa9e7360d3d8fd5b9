scsi: target: tcm_loop: Convert to new submission API

target_submit_cmd_map_sgls() is being removed, so convert loop to
the new submission API.

Even though loop does its own shutdown sync, this has loop use
target_init_cmd()/target_submit_prep()/target_submit() since it needed to
map sgls and in the next patches it will use the API to use LIO's
workqueue.
