net: liquidio: Add missing null pointer checks

The functions send_rx_ctrl_cmd() in both liquidio/lio_main.c and
liquidio/lio_vf_main.c do not check if the call to
octeon_alloc_soft_command() fails and returns a null pointer. Both
functions also return void so errors are not propagated back to the
caller.

Fix these issues by updating both instances of send_rx_ctrl_cmd() to
return an integer rather than void, and have them return -ENOMEM if an
allocation failure occurs. Also update all callers of send_rx_ctrl_cmd()
so that they now check the return value.
