lib: bitmap: support "N" as an alias for size of bitmap

While this is done for all bitmaps, the original use case in mind was
for CPU masks and cpulist_parse() as described below.

It seems that a common configuration is to use the 1st couple cores for
housekeeping tasks.  This tends to leave the remaining ones to form a
pool of similarly configured cores to take on the real workload of
interest to the user.

So on machine A - with 32 cores, it could be 0-3 for "system" and then
4-31 being used in boot args like nohz_full=, or rcu_nocbs= as part of
setting up the worker pool of CPUs.

But then newer machine B is added, and it has 48 cores, and so while
the 0-3 part remains unchanged, the pool setup cpu list becomes 4-47.

Multiple deployment becomes easier when we can just simply replace 31
and 47 with "N" and let the system substitute in the actual number at
boot; a number that it knows better than we do.
