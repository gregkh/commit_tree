KVM: arm64: Simplify argument passing to vgic_uaccess_[read|write]

vgic_uaccess() takes a struct vgic_io_device argument, converts it
to a struct kvm_io_device and passes it to the read/write accessor
functions, which convert it back to a struct vgic_io_device.
Avoid the indirection by passing the struct vgic_io_device argument
directly to vgic_uaccess_{read,write}.
