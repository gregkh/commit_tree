ceph: rip out old fscache readpage handling

With the new netfs read helper functions, we won't need a lot of this
infrastructure as it handles the pagecache pages itself. Rip out the
read handling for now, and much of the old infrastructure that deals in
individual pages.

The cookie handling is mostly unchanged, however.
