xen-pciback: reconfigure also from backend watch handler

When multiple PCI devices get assigned to a guest right at boot, libxl
incrementally populates the backend tree. The writes for the first of
the devices trigger the backend watch. In turn xen_pcibk_setup_backend()
will set the XenBus state to Initialised, at which point no further
reconfigures would happen unless a device got hotplugged. Arrange for
reconfigure to also get triggered from the backend watch handler.
