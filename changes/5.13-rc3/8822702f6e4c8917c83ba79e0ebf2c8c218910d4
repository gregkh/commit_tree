ALSA: hda/realtek: reset eapd coeff to default value for alc287

Ubuntu users reported an audio bug on the Lenovo Yoga Slim 7 14IIL05,
he installed dual OS (Windows + Linux), if he booted to the Linux
from Windows, the Speaker can't work well, it has crackling noise,
if he poweroff the machine first after Windows, the Speaker worked
well.

Before rebooting or shutdown from Windows, the Windows changes the
codec eapd coeff value, but the BIOS doesn't re-initialize its value,
when booting into the Linux from Windows, the eapd coeff value is not
correct. To fix it, set the codec default value to that coeff register
in the alsa driver.
