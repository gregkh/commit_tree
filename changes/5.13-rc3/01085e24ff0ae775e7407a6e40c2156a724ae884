devtmpfs: actually reclaim some init memory

Currently gcc seems to inline devtmpfs_setup() into devtmpfsd(), so
its memory footprint isn't reclaimed as intended. Mark it noinline to
make sure it gets put in .init.text.

While here, setup_done can also be put in .init.data: After complete()
releases the internal spinlock, the completion object is never touched
again by that thread, and the waiting thread doesn't proceed until it
observes ->done while holding that spinlock.

This is now the same pattern as for kthreadd_done in init/main.c:
complete() is done in a __ref function, while the corresponding
wait_for_completion() is in an __init function.
