iio: add reference to iio buffer on iio_dev_attr

This change adds a reference to a 'struct iio_buffer' object on the
iio_dev_attr object. This way, we can use the created iio_dev_attr objects
on per-buffer basis (since they're allocated anyway).

A minor downside of this change is that the number of parameters on
__iio_add_chan_devattr() grows by 1. This looks like it could do with a bit
of a re-think.
