USB: cdc-acm: add more Maxlinear/Exar models to ignore list

Now that the xr_serial got support for other models, add their USB IDs
as well.

The Maxlinear/Exar USB UARTs can be used in either ACM mode using the
cdc-acm driver or in "custom driver" mode in which further features such
as hardware and software flow control, GPIO control and in-band
line-status reporting are available.

In ACM mode the device always enables RTS/CTS flow control, something
which could prevent transmission in case the CTS input isn't wired up
correctly.

Ensure that cdc_acm will not bind to these devices if the custom
USB-serial driver is enabled.
