xhci: Do not use GFP_KERNEL in (potentially) atomic context

'xhci_urb_enqueue()' is passed a 'mem_flags' argument, because "URBs may be
submitted in interrupt context" (see comment related to 'usb_submit_urb()'
in 'drivers/usb/core/urb.c')

So this flag should be used in all the calling chain.
Up to now, 'xhci_check_maxpacket()' which is only called from
'xhci_urb_enqueue()', uses GFP_KERNEL.

Be safe and pass the mem_flags to this function as well.
