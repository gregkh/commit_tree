mm: vmscan: don't need allocate shrinker->nr_deferred for memcg aware shrinkers

Now nr_deferred is available on per memcg level for memcg aware
shrinkers, so don't need allocate shrinker->nr_deferred for such
shrinkers anymore.

The prealloc_memcg_shrinker() would return -ENOSYS if !CONFIG_MEMCG or
memcg is disabled by kernel command line, then shrinker's
SHRINKER_MEMCG_AWARE flag would be cleared.  This makes the
implementation of this patch simpler.
