perf/x86/intel/uncore: Rename uncore_notifier to uncore_pci_sub_notifier

Perf will use a similar method to the PCI sub driver to register
the PMUs for the PCI type of uncore blocks. The method requires a BUS
notifier to support hotplug. The current BUS notifier cannot be reused,
because it searches a const id_table for the corresponding registered
PMU. The PCI type of uncore blocks in the discovery tables doesn't
provide an id_table.

Factor out uncore_bus_notify() and add the pointer of an id_table as a
parameter. The uncore_bus_notify() will be reused in the following
patch.

The current BUS notifier is only used by the PCI sub driver. Its name is
too generic. Rename it to uncore_pci_sub_notifier, which is specific for
the PCI sub driver.
