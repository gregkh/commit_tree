net/smc: properly handle workqueue allocation failure

In smcd_alloc_dev(), if alloc_ordered_workqueue() fails, properly catch
it, clean up and return NULL to let the caller know there was a failure.
Move the call to alloc_ordered_workqueue higher in the function in order
to abort earlier without needing to unwind the call to device_initialize().
