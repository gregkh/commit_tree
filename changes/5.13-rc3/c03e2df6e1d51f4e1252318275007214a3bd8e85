iio:adc:stm32-adc: Add HAS_IOMEM dependency

Seems that there are config combinations in which this driver gets enabled
and hence selects the MFD, but with out HAS_IOMEM getting pulled in
via some other route.  MFD is entirely contained in an
if HAS_IOMEM block, leading to the build issue in this bugzilla.
