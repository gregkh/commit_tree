drm/i915: Fix TGL+ plane SAGV watermark programming

When we switch between SAGV on vs. off we need to reprogram all
plane wateramrks accordingly. Currently skl_wm_add_affected_planes()
totally ignores the SAGV watermark and just assumes we will use
the normal WM0.

Fix this by utilizing skl_plane_wm_level() which picks the
correct watermark based on use_sagv_wm. Thus we will force
an update on all the planes whose watermark registers need
to be reprogrammed.
