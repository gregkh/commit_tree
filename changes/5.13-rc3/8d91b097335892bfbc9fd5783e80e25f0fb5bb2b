riscv: Consistify protect_kernel_linear_mapping_text_rodata() use

The various uses of protect_kernel_linear_mapping_text_rodata() are
not consistent:
  - Its definition depends on "64BIT && !XIP_KERNEL",
  - Its forward declaration depends on MMU,
  - Its single caller depends on "STRICT_KERNEL_RWX && 64BIT && MMU &&
    !XIP_KERNEL".

Fix this by settling on the dependencies of the caller, which can be
simplified as STRICT_KERNEL_RWX depends on "MMU && !XIP_KERNEL".
Provide a dummy definition, as the caller is protected by
"IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX)" instead of "#ifdef
CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX".
