locking/lockdep: Correct calling tracepoints

The commit eb1f00237aca ("lockdep,trace: Expose tracepoints") reverses
tracepoints for lock_contended() and lock_acquired(), thus the ftrace
log shows the wrong locking sequence that "acquired" event is prior to
"contended" event:

  <idle>-0       [001] d.s3 20803.501685: lock_acquire: 0000000008b91ab4 &sg_policy->update_lock
  <idle>-0       [001] d.s3 20803.501686: lock_acquired: 0000000008b91ab4 &sg_policy->update_lock
  <idle>-0       [001] d.s3 20803.501689: lock_contended: 0000000008b91ab4 &sg_policy->update_lock
  <idle>-0       [001] d.s3 20803.501690: lock_release: 0000000008b91ab4 &sg_policy->update_lock

This patch fixes calling tracepoints for lock_contended() and
lock_acquired().
