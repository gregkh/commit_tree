ALSA: hda/cirrus: Increase AUTO_CFG_MAX_INS from 8 to 18

In preparation to support Cirrus Logic CS8409 HDA bridge on new Dell platforms
it is nessasary to increase AUTO_CFG_MAX_INS and AUTO_CFG_NUM_INPUTS values.
Currently AUTO_CFG_MAX_INS is limited to 8, but Cirrus Logic HDA bridge CS8409
has 18 input pins, 16 ASP receivers and 2 DMIC inputs. We have to increase this
value to 18, so generic code can handle this correctly.

Tested on DELL Inspiron-3505, DELL Inspiron-3501, DELL Inspiron-3500
