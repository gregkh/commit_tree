powerpc/kconfig: Restore alphabetic order of the selects under CONFIG_PPC

Commit a7d2475af7ae ("powerpc: Sort the selects under CONFIG_PPC")
sorted all selects under CONFIG_PPC.

4 years later, several items have been introduced at wrong place,
a few other have been renamed without moving them to their correct
place.

Reorder them now.

While we are at it, simplify the test for a couple of them:
- PPC_64 && PPC_PSERIES is simplified in PPC_PSERIES
- PPC_64 && PPC_BOOK3S is simplified in PPC_BOOK3S_64
