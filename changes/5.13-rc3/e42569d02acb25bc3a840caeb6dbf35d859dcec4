drm/amd/pm: Modify mode2 msg sequence on aldebaran

v1: During mode2 reset, PCI space is lost after message is sent.
Restore PCI space before waiting for response from firmware.

v2: Move mode2 sequence to aldebaran and update PMFW version.
Handle generic sequence in smu13 without PMFW version check.
