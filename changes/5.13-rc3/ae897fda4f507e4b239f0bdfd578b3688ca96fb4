x86/Xen: swap NX determination and GDT setup on BSP

xen_setup_gdt(), via xen_load_gdt_boot(), wants to adjust page tables.
For this to work when NX is not available, x86_configure_nx() needs to
be called first.

[jgross] Note that this is a revert of 36104cb9012a82e73 ("x86/xen:
Delay get_cpu_cap until stack canary is established"), which is possible
now that we no longer support running as PV guest in 32-bit mode.
