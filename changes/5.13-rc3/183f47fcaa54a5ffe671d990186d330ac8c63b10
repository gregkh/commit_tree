kcov: Remove kcov include from sched.h and move it to its users.

The recent addition of in_serving_softirq() to kconv.h results in
compile failure on PREEMPT_RT because it requires
task_struct::softirq_disable_cnt. This is not available if kconv.h is
included from sched.h.

It is not needed to include kconv.h from sched.h. All but the net/ user
already include the kconv header file.

Move the include of the kconv.h header from sched.h it its users.
Additionally include sched.h from kconv.h to ensure that everything
task_struct related is available.
