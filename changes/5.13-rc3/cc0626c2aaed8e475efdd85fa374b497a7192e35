net: smsc911x: skip acpi_device_id table when !CONFIG_ACPI

The driver can match via multiple methods.  Its acpi_device_id table is
referenced via ACPI_PTR() so it will be unused for !CONFIG_ACPI builds:

  drivers/net/ethernet/smsc/smsc911x.c:2652:36: warning:
    ‘smsc911x_acpi_match’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
