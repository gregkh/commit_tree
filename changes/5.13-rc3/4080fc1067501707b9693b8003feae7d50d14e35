vdpa_sim: use iova module to allocate IOVA addresses

The identical mapping used until now created issues when mapping
different virtual pages with the same physical address.
To solve this issue, we can use the iova module, to handle the IOVA
allocation.
For simplicity we use an IOVA allocator with byte granularity.

We add two new functions, vdpasim_map_range() and vdpasim_unmap_range(),
to handle the IOVA allocation and the registration into the IOMMU/IOTLB.
These functions are used by dma_map_ops callbacks.
