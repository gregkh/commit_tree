crypto: hisilicon/qm - set the number of queues for function

Kunpeng930 supports queue doorbell isolation.
When doorbell isolation is enabled, it supports to obtain the
maximum number of queues of one function from hardware register.
Otherwise, the 'max_qp_num' is the total number of queues.

When assigning queues to VF, it is necessary to ensure that the number
of VF queues does not exceed 'max_qp_num'.
