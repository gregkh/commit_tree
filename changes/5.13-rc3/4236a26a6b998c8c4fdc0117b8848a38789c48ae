cifs: remove deadstore in cifs_close_all_deferred_files()

Deadstore detected by Lukas Bulwahn's CodeChecker Tool (ELISA group).

line 741 struct cifsInodeInfo *cinode;
line 747 cinode = CIFS_I(d_inode(cfile->dentry));
could be deleted.

cinode on filesystem should not be deleted when files are closed,
they are representations of some data fields on a physical disk,
thus no further action is required.
The virtual inode on vfs will be handled by vfs automatically,
and the denotation is inode, which is different from the cinode.
