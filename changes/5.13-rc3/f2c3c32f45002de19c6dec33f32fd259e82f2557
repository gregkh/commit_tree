selftests/perf_events: Add kselftest for process-wide sigtrap handling

Add a kselftest for testing process-wide perf events with synchronous
SIGTRAP on events (using breakpoints). In particular, we want to test
that changes to the event propagate to all children, and the SIGTRAPs
are in fact synchronously sent to the thread where the event occurred.

Note: The "signal_stress" test case is also added later in the series to
perf tool's built-in tests. The test here is more elaborate in that
respect, which on one hand avoids bloating the perf tool unnecessarily,
but we also benefit from structured tests with TAP-compliant output that
the kselftest framework provides.
