mmc: dw_mmc-rockchip: Just set default sample value for legacy mode

.set_ios() is called from .resume() as well. For SDIO device which sets
keep-power-in-suspend, nothing should be changed after resuming, as well
as sample tuning value, since this value is tuned already. So we should
not overwrite it with the default value.
