Revert "net: fujitsu: fix a potential NULL pointer dereference"

This reverts commit 9f4d6358e11bbc7b839f9419636188e4151fb6e4.

Because of recent interactions with developers from @umn.edu, all
commits from them have been recently re-reviewed to ensure if they were
correct or not.

Upon review, this commit was found to be incorrect for the reasons
below, so it must be reverted.  It will be fixed up "correctly" in a
later kernel change.

The original change does not change any behavior as the caller of this
function onlyu checks for "== -1" as an error condition so this error is
not handled properly.  Remove this change and it will be fixed up
properly in a later commit.
