arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: trogdor: Add label to charger thermal zone

Some revisions of trogdor boards use a thermistor for the charger
temperature which currently isn't supported by the PM6150 ADC
driver. This results in bogus temperature readings. Add a label
to the charger thermal zone to facilitate disabling of the thermal
zone on affected boards.
