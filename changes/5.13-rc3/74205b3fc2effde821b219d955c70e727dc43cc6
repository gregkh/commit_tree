powerpc/vdso: Add support for time namespaces

This patch adds the necessary glue to provide time namespaces.

Things are mainly copied from ARM64.

__arch_get_timens_vdso_data() calculates timens vdso data position
based on the vdso data position, knowing it is the next page in vvar.
This avoids having to redo the mflr/bcl/mflr/mtlr dance to locate
the page relative to running code position.
