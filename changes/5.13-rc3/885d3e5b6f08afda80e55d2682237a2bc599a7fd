drm/i915/display: fix comment on skl straps

We are not checking for specific SKUs and feedback from HW team is that
it may not work since it was supposed to be fixed by the same time
straps stopped to be used. So, just update comment.

v2: Instead of removing the check, just update the comment since
feedback from HW team was that it actually may not work
