iommu: Statically set module owner

It happens that the 3 drivers which first supported being modular are
also ones which play games with their pgsize_bitmap, so have non-const
iommu_ops where dynamically setting the owner manages to work out OK.
However, it's less than ideal to force that upon all drivers which want
to be modular - like the new sprd-iommu driver which now has a potential
bug in that regard - so let's just statically set the module owner and
let ops remain const wherever possible.
