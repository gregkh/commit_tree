staging: rtl8723bs: remove unused variable from rtw_os_recv_indicate_pkt

Remove unused 'ret' variable from rtw_os_recv_indicate_pkt function in
drivers/staging/rtl8723bs/os_dep/recv_linux.c as nothing is actually
done with it. A function return val is conditionally stored to it under
certain circumstances, but nothing is done with it after. Fixes a
warning from kernel test robot.
