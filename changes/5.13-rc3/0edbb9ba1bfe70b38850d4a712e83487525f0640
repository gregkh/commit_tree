drm/i915: Move cmd parser pinning to execbuffer

We need to get rid of allocations in the cmd parser, because it needs
to be called from a signaling context, first move all pinning to
execbuf, where we already hold all locks.

Allocate jump_whitelist in the execbuffer, and add annotations around
intel_engine_cmd_parser(), to ensure we only call the command parser
without allocating any memory, or taking any locks we're not supposed to.

Because i915_gem_object_get_page() may also allocate memory, add a
path to i915_gem_object_get_sg() that prevents memory allocations,
and walk the sg list manually. It should be similarly fast.

This has the added benefit of being able to catch all memory allocation
errors before the point of no return, and return -ENOMEM safely to the
execbuf submitter.
