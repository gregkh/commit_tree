tasklets: Replace spin wait in tasklet_unlock_wait()

tasklet_unlock_wait() spin waits for TASKLET_STATE_RUN to be cleared. This
is wasting CPU cycles in a tight loop which is especially painful in a
guest when the CPU running the tasklet is scheduled out.

tasklet_unlock_wait() is invoked from tasklet_kill() which is used in
teardown paths and not performance critical at all. Replace the spin wait
with wait_var_event().

There are no users of tasklet_unlock_wait() which are invoked from atomic
contexts. The usage in tasklet_disable() has been replaced temporarily with
the spin waiting variant until the atomic users are fixed up and will be
converted to the sleep wait variant later.
