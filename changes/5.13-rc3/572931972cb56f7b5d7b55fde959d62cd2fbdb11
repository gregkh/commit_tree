platform/x86: add Gigabyte WMI temperature driver

Tested with
* X570 I Aorus Pro Wifi (rev 1.0)
* B550M DS3H
* B550 Gaming X V2 (rev.1.x)
* Z390 I AORUS PRO WIFI (rev. 1.0)

Those mainboards contain an ITE chips for management and
monitoring.

They could also be handled by drivers/hwmon/i87.c.
But the SuperIO range used by i87 is already claimed and used by the
firmware.

The following warning is printed at boot:

kernel: ACPI Warning: SystemIO range 0x0000000000000A45-0x0000000000000A46 conflicts with OpRegion 0x0000000000000A45-0x0000000000000A46 (\GSA1.SIO1) (20200528/utaddress-204)
kernel: ACPI: This conflict may cause random problems and system instability
kernel: ACPI: If an ACPI driver is available for this device, you should use it instead of the native driver

This driver implements such an ACPI driver.

Unfortunately not all sensor registers are handled by the firmware and even
less are exposed via WMI.
