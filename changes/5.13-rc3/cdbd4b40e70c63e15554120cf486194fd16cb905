KVM: VMX: Invalidate hv_tlb_eptp to denote an EPTP mismatch

Drop the dedicated 'ept_pointers_match' field in favor of stuffing
'hv_tlb_eptp' with INVALID_PAGE to mark it as invalid, i.e. to denote
that there is at least one EPTP mismatch.  Use a local variable to
track whether or not a mismatch is detected so that hv_tlb_eptp can be
used to skip redundant flushes.

No functional change intended.
