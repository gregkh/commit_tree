nvme: implement non-mdts command limits

Commands that access LBA contents without a data transfer between the
host historically have not had a spec defined upper limit. The driver
set the queue constraints for such commands to the max data transfer
size just to be safe, but this artificial constraint frequently limits
devices below their capabilities.

The NVMe Workgroup ratified TP4040 defines how a controller may
advertise their non-MDTS limits. Use these if provided and default to
the current constraints if not. Since the Dataset Management command
limits are defined in logical blocks, but without a namespace to tell us
the logical block size, the code defaults to the safe 512b size.
