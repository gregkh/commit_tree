net/mlx5e: TC, Add sampler restore handle API

Use common object pool to create an object ID to map sample parameters.
Allocate a modify header action to write the object ID to reg_c0 lower
16 bits. Create a restore rule to pass the object ID to software. So
software can identify sampled packets via the object ID and send it to
userspace.

Aggregate the modify header action, restore rule and object ID to a
sample restore handle. Re-use identical sample restore handle for
the same object ID.
