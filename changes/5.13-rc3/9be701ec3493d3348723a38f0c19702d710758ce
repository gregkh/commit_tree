ASoC: meson: axg-fifo: add NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP support

On the AXG family, the fifo irq is not necessary for the HW to operate.
It is just used to notify that a period has elapsed. If userpace does not
care for these wakeups (such as pipewire), we are just wasting CPU cycles.

Add support for NO_PERIOD_WAKEUP and disable irq when they are no needed.
