btrfs: exclude mmaps while doing remap

Darrick reported a potential issue to me where we could allow mmap
writes after validating a page range matched in the case of dedupe.
Generally we rely on lock page -> lock extent with the ordered flush to
protect us, but this is done after we check the pages because we use the
generic helpers, so we could modify the page in between doing the check
and locking the range.

There also exists a deadlock, as described by Filipe

"""
When cloning a file range, we lock the inodes, flush any delalloc within
the respective file ranges, wait for any ordered extents and then lock the
file ranges in both inodes. This means that right after we flush delalloc
and before we lock the file ranges, memory mapped writes can come in and
dirty pages in the file ranges of the clone operation.

Most of the time this is harmless and causes no problems. However, if we
are low on available metadata space, we can later end up in a deadlock
when starting a transaction to replace file extent items. This happens if
when allocating metadata space for the transaction, we need to wait for
the async reclaim thread to release space and the reclaim thread needs to
flush delalloc for the inode that got the memory mapped write and has its
range locked by the clone task.

Basically what happens is the following:

1) A clone operation locks inodes A and B, flushes delalloc for both
   inodes in the respective file ranges and waits for any ordered extents
   in those ranges to complete;

2) Before the clone task locks the file ranges, another task does a
   memory mapped write (which does not lock the inode) for one of the
   inodes of the clone operation. So now we have a dirty page in one of
   the ranges used by the clone operation;

3) The clone operation locks the file ranges for inodes A and B;

4) Later, when iterating over the file extents of inode A, the clone
   task attempts to start a transaction. There's not enough available
   free metadata space, so the async reclaim task is started (if not
   running already) and we wait for someone to wake us up on our
   reservation ticket;

5) The async reclaim task is not able to release space by any other
   means and decides to flush delalloc for the inode of the clone
   operation;

6) The workqueue job used to flush the inode blocks when starting
   delalloc for the inode, since the file range is currently locked by
   the clone task;

7) But the clone task is waiting on its reservation ticket and the async
   reclaim task is waiting on the flush job to complete, which can't
   progress since the clone task has the file range locked. So unless
   some other task is able to release space, for example an ordered
   extent for some other inode completes, we have a deadlock between all
   these tasks;

When this happens stack traces like the following show up in dmesg/syslog:

Fix both of these issues by excluding mmaps from happening we are doing
any sort of remap, which prevents this race completely.
