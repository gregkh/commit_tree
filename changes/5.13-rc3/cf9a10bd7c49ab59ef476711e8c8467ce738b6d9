net: ipa: move ipa_resource_type definition

Most platforms have the same set of source and destination resource
types.  But some older platforms have some additional ones, and it's
possible different resources will be used in the future.

Move the definition of the ipa_resource_type enumerated type so it
is defined for each platform in its configuration data file.  This
permits each to have a distinct set of resources.

Shorten the data files slightly, by putting the min and max limit
values on the same line.
