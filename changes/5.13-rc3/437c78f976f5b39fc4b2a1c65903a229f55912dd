net: ipa: avoid 64-bit modulus

It is possible for a 32 bit x86 build to use a 64 bit DMA address.

There are two remaining spots where the IPA driver does a modulo
operation to check alignment of a DMA address, and under certain
conditions this can lead to a build error on i386 (at least).

The alignment checks we're doing are for power-of-2 values, and this
means the lower 32 bits of the DMA address can be used.  This ensures
both operands to the modulo operator are 32 bits wide.
