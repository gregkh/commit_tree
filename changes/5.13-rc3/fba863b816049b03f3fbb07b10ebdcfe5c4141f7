net: phy: make PHY PM ops a no-op if MAC driver manages PHY PM

Resume callback of the PHY driver is called after the one for the MAC
driver. The PHY driver resume callback calls phy_init_hw(), and this is
potentially problematic if the MAC driver calls phy_start() in its resume
callback. One issue was reported with the fec driver and a KSZ8081 PHY
which seems to become unstable if a soft reset is triggered during aneg.

The new flag allows MAC drivers to indicate that they take care of
suspending/resuming the PHY. Then the MAC PM callbacks can handle
any dependency between MAC and PHY PM.
