drm/qxl: use ttm bo priorities

Allow to set priorities for buffer objects.  Use priority 1 for surface
and cursor command releases.  Use priority 0 for drawing command
releases.  That way the short-living drawing commands are first in line
when it comes to eviction, making it *much* less likely that
ttm_bo_mem_force_space() picks something which can't be evicted and
throws an error after waiting a while without success.
