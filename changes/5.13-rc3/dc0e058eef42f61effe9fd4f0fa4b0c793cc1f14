KVM: selftests: aarch64/vgic-v3 init sequence tests

The tests exercise the VGIC_V3 device creation including the
associated KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_ADDR group attributes:

- KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_DIST/REDIST
- KVM_VGIC_V3_ADDR_TYPE_REDIST_REGION

Some other tests dedicate to KVM_DEV_ARM_VGIC_GRP_REDIST_REGS group
and especially the GICR_TYPER read. The goal was to test the case
recently fixed by commit 23bde34771f1
("KVM: arm64: vgic-v3: Drop the reporting of GICR_TYPER.Last for userspace").

The API under test can be found at
