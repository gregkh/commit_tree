PCI/sysfs: Rename "vpd" attribute accessors

Rename "vpd" attribute accessors so they fit with the BIN_ATTR_RW() macro
usage.  Currently there is no BIN_ATTR_ADMIN_RW() that uses 0600
permissions, but if there were, it would likely use "vpd_read()" and
"vpd_write()".  No functional change intended.
