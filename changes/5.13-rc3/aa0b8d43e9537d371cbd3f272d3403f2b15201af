libbpf: Record extern sym relocation first

This patch records the extern sym relocs first before recording
subprog relocs.  The later patch will have relocs for extern
kernel function call which is also using BPF_JMP | BPF_CALL.
It will be easier to handle the extern symbols first in
the later patch.

is_call_insn() helper is added.  The existing is_ldimm64() helper
is renamed to is_ldimm64_insn() for consistency.
