mmc: core: Use userland specified timeout value for eMMC sanitize

As the density increases, the 4-minute timeout value for sanitize is no
longer feasible. At the same time, devices of different densities have
different timeout values, which makes it difficult to use a common timeout
value. Therefore, let's pass down the userland-specified sanitize timeout
value so it can be used.
