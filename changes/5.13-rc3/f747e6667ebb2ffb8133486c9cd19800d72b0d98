linux/bits.h: fix compilation error with GENMASK

GENMASK() has an input check which uses __builtin_choose_expr() to
enable a compile time sanity check of its inputs if they are known at
compile time.

However, it turns out that __builtin_constant_p() does not always return
a compile time constant [0].  It was thought this problem was fixed with
gcc 4.9 [1], but apparently this is not the case [2].

Switch to use __is_constexpr() instead which always returns a compile time
constant, regardless of its inputs.
