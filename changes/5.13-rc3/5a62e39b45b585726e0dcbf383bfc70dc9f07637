bus: mhi: core: Allow sending the STOP channel command

Add support to allow sending the STOP channel command. If a
client driver would like to STOP a channel and have the device
retain the channel context instead of issuing a RESET to it and
clearing the context, this would provide support for it after
the ability to send this command is exposed to clients.
