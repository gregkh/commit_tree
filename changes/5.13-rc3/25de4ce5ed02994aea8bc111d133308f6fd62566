clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Handle dra7 timer wrap errata i940

There is a timer wrap issue on dra7 for the ARM architected timer.
In a typical clock configuration the timer fails to wrap after 388 days.

To work around the issue, we need to use timer-ti-dm percpu timers instead.

Let's configure dmtimer3 and 4 as percpu timers by default, and warn about
the issue if the dtb is not configured properly.

Let's do this as a single patch so it can be backported to v5.8 and later
kernels easily. Note that this patch depends on earlier timer-ti-dm
systimer posted mode fixes, and a preparatory clockevent patch
"clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Prepare to handle dra7 timer wrap issue".

For more information, please see the errata for "AM572x Sitara Processors
Silicon Revisions 1.1, 2.0":

The concept is based on earlier reference patches done by Tero Kristo and
Keerthy.
