ALSA: dice: disable double_pcm_frames mode for M-Audio Profire 610, 2626 and Avid M-Box 3 Pro

ALSA dice driver detects jumbo payload at high sampling transfer frequency
for below models:

 * Avid M-Box 3 Pro
 * M-Audio Profire 610
 * M-Audio Profire 2626

Although many DICE-based devices have a quirk at high sampling transfer
frequency to multiplex double number of PCM frames into data block than
the number in IEC 61883-1/6, the above devices are just compliant to
IEC 61883-1/6.

This commit disables the mode of double_pcm_frames for the models.
