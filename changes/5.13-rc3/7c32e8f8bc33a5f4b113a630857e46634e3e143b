bpf: Add PROG_TEST_RUN support for sk_lookup programs

Allow to pass sk_lookup programs to PROG_TEST_RUN. User space
provides the full bpf_sk_lookup struct as context. Since the
context includes a socket pointer that can't be exposed
to user space we define that PROG_TEST_RUN returns the cookie
of the selected socket or zero in place of the socket pointer.

We don't support testing programs that select a reuseport socket,
since this would mean running another (unrelated) BPF program
from the sk_lookup test handler.
