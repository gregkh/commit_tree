perf stat: Warn group events from different hybrid PMU

If a group has events which are from different hybrid PMUs,
shows a warning:

"WARNING: events in group from different hybrid PMUs!"

This is to remind the user not to put the core event and atom
event into one group.

Next, just disable grouping.

  # perf stat -e "{cpu_core/cycles/,cpu_atom/cycles/}" -a -- sleep 1
  WARNING: events in group from different hybrid PMUs!
  WARNING: grouped events cpus do not match, disabling group:
    anon group { cpu_core/cycles/, cpu_atom/cycles/ }

   Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

           5,438,125      cpu_core/cycles/
           3,914,586      cpu_atom/cycles/
