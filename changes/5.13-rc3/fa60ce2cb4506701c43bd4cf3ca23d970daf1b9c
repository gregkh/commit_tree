treewide: remove editor modelines and cruft

The section "19) Editor modelines and other cruft" in
Documentation/process/coding-style.rst clearly says, "Do not include any
of these in source files."

I recently receive a patch to explicitly add a new one.

Let's do treewide cleanups, otherwise some people follow the existing code
and attempt to upstream their favoriate editor setups.

It is even nicer if scripts/checkpatch.pl can check it.

If we like to impose coding style in an editor-independent manner, I think
editorconfig (patch [1]) is a saner solution.
