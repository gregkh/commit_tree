RDMA/rtrs-clt: Print more info when an error happens

Client prints only error value and it is not enough for debugging.

1. When client receives an error from server: the client does not only
   print the error value but also more information of server connection.

2. When client failes to send IO: the client gets an error from RDMA
   layer. It also print more information of server connection.
