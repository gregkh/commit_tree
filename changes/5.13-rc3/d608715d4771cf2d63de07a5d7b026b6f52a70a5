Drivers: hv: vmbus: Move handling of VMbus interrupts

VMbus interrupts are most naturally modelled as per-cpu IRQs.  But
because x86/x64 doesn't have per-cpu IRQs, the core VMbus interrupt
handling machinery is done in code under arch/x86 and Linux IRQs are
not used.  Adding support for ARM64 means adding equivalent code
using per-cpu IRQs under arch/arm64.

A better model is to treat per-cpu IRQs as the normal path (which it is
for modern architectures), and the x86/x64 path as the exception.  Do this
by incorporating standard Linux per-cpu IRQ allocation into the main VMbus
driver, and bypassing it in the x86/x64 exception case. For x86/x64,
special case code is retained under arch/x86, but no VMbus interrupt
handling code is needed under arch/arm64.

No functional change.
