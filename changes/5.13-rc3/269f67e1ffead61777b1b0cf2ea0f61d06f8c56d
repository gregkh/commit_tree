cifs: store a pointer to the root dentry in cifs_sb_info once we have completed mounting the share

And use this to only allow to take out a shared handle once the mount has completed and the
sb becomes available.
This will become important in follow up patches where we will start holding a reference to the
directory dentry for the shared handle during the lifetime of the handle.
