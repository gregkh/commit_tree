usb: dwc3: add cancelled reasons for dwc3 requests

Currently, when dwc3 handles request cancelled, dwc3 just returns
-ECONNRESET for all requests. It will cause USB function drivers
can't know if the requests are cancelled by other reasons.

This patch will replace DWC3_REQUEST_STATUS_CANCELLED with the
reasons below.
  - DWC3_REQUEST_STATUS_DISCONNECTED
  - DWC3_REQUEST_STATUS_DEQUEUED
  - DWC3_REQUEST_STATUS_STALLED
