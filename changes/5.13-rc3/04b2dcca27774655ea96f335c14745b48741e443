staging: comedi: dt2814: Remove struct dt2814_private

The `ntrig` member of the `struct dt2814_private` pointed to by
`dev->private` is no longer used as a counter to determine the end of
acquisition for a Comedi asynchronous command.  The other member
`curadscan` is also unused.  Remove the allocation of the private data
during initialization and remove the definition of `struct
dt2814_private` since they are no longer needed.
