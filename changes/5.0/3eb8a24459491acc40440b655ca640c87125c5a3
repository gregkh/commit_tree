ALSA: fireface: add driver data for register for MIDI high address

Fireface 400 and 800 have the same mechanism to decide address to which
asynchronous transactions are sent for MIDI messages, however they use
different registers for controllers to notify higher 4 byte of the
address.

This commit adds a model-specific parameter to represent the address.
Additionally, it corrects some comments. I note that these two models have
a difference to enable/disable the transaction.
