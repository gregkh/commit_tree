USB: serial: ftdi_sio: fix GPIO not working in autosuspend

There is a bug in the current GPIO code for ftdi_sio: it failed to take USB
autosuspend into account. If the device is in autosuspend, calls to
usb_control_msg() fail with -EHOSTUNREACH. Because the standard value for
autosuspend timeout is usually 2-5 seconds, this made it almost impossible
to use the GPIOs on machines that have USB autosuspend enabled. This patch
fixes the issue by acquiring a PM lock on the device for the duration of
the USB transfers. Tested on an FT231X device.
