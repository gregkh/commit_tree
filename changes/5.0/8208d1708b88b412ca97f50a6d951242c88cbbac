irqchip/gic-v3-its: Align PCI Multi-MSI allocation on their size

The way we allocate events works fine in most cases, except
when multiple PCI devices share an ITS-visible DevID, and that
one of them is trying to use MultiMSI allocation.

In that case, our allocation is not guaranteed to be zero-based
anymore, and we have to make sure we allocate it on a boundary
that is compatible with the PCI Multi-MSI constraints.

Fix this by allocating the full region upfront instead of iterating
over the number of MSIs. MSI-X are always allocated one by one,
so this shouldn't change anything on that front.
