s390/qeth: don't process hsuid in qeth_l3_setup_netdev()

qeth_l3_setup_netdev() checks if the hsuid attribute is set on the qeth
device, and propagates it to the net_device. In the past this was needed
to pick up any hsuid that was set before allocation of the net_device.

With commit d3d1b205e89f ("s390/qeth: allocate netdevice early") this
is no longer necessary, qeth_l3_dev_hsuid_store() always stores the
hsuid straight into dev->perm_addr.
