acpi/nfit: Fix command-supported detection

The _DSM function number validation only happens to succeed when the
generic Linux command number translation corresponds with a
DSM-family-specific function number. This breaks NVDIMM-N
implementations that correctly implement _LSR, _LSW, and _LSI, but do
not happen to publish support for DSM function numbers 4, 5, and 6.

Recall that the support for _LS{I,R,W} family of methods results in the
DIMM being marked as supporting those command numbers at
acpi_nfit_register_dimms() time. The DSM function mask is only used for
ND_CMD_CALL support of non-NVDIMM_FAMILY_INTEL devices.
