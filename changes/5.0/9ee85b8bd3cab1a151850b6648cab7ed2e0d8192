pstore/ram: Standardize module name in ramoops

With both ram.c and ram_core.c built into ramoops.ko, it doesn't make
sense to have differing pr_fmt prefixes. This fixes ram_core.c to use
the module name (as ram.c already does). Additionally improves region
reservation error to include the region name.
