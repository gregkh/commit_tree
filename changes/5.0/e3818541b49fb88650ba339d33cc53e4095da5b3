ipv6: Return error for RTA_VIA attribute

IPv6 currently does not support nexthops outside of the AF_INET6 family.
Specifically, it does not handle RTA_VIA attribute. If it is passed
in a route add request, the actual route added only uses the device
which is clearly not what the user intended:

  $ ip -6 ro add 2001:db8:2::/64 via inet 172.16.1.1 dev eth0
  $ ip ro ls
  ...
  2001:db8:2::/64 dev eth0 metric 1024 pref medium

Catch this and fail the route add:
  $ ip -6 ro add 2001:db8:2::/64 via inet 172.16.1.1 dev eth0
  Error: IPv6 does not support RTA_VIA attribute.
