signal: Always attempt to allocate siginfo for SIGSTOP

Since 2.5.34 the code has had the potential to not allocate siginfo
for SIGSTOP signals.  Except for ptrace this is perfectly fine as only
ptrace can use PTRACE_PEEK_SIGINFO and see what the contents of
the delivered siginfo are.

Users of PTRACE_PEEK_SIGINFO that care about the contents siginfo
for SIGSTOP are rare, but they do exist.  A seccomp self test
has cared and lldb cares.

Everyone affected by this please note.  The kernel can still fail to
allocate a siginfo structure.  The allocation is with GFP_KERNEL and
is best effort only.  If memory is tight when the signal allocation
comes in this will fail to allocate a siginfo.

So I strongly recommend looking at more robust solutions for
synchronizing with a single thread such as PTRACE_INTERRUPT.  Or if
that does not work persuading your friendly local kernel developer to
build the interface you need.
