net: qualcomm: rmnet: move null check on dev before dereferecing it

Currently dev is dereferenced by the call dev_net(dev) before dev is null
checked.  Fix this by null checking dev before the potential null
pointer dereference.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1462955 ("Dereference before null check")
