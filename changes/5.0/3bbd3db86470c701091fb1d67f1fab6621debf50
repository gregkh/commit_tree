arm64: relocatable: fix inconsistencies in linker script and options

readelf complains about the section layout of vmlinux when building
with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y (for KASLR):

  readelf: Warning: [21]: Link field (0) should index a symtab section.
  readelf: Warning: [21]: Info field (0) should index a relocatable section.

Also, it seems that our use of '-pie -shared' is contradictory, and
thus ambiguous. In general, the way KASLR is wired up at the moment
is highly tailored to how ld.bfd happens to implement (and conflate)
PIE executables and shared libraries, so given the current effort to
support other toolchains, let's fix some of these issues as well.

- Drop the -pie linker argument and just leave -shared. In ld.bfd,
  the differences between them are unclear (except for the ELF type
  of the produced image [0]) but lld chokes on seeing both at the
  same time.

- Rename the .rela output section to .rela.dyn, as is customary for
  shared libraries and PIE executables, so that it is not misidentified
  by readelf as a static relocation section (producing the warnings
  above).

- Pass the -z notext and -z norelro options to explicitly instruct the
  linker to permit text relocations, and to omit the RELRO program
  header (which requires a certain section layout that we don't adhere
  to in the kernel). These are the defaults for current versions of
  ld.bfd.

- Discard .eh_frame and .gnu.hash sections to avoid them from being
  emitted between .head.text and .text, screwing up the section layout.

These changes only affect the ELF image, and produce the same binary
image.
