drm/i915/execlists: Avoid kicking priority on the current context

If the request is currently on the HW (in port 0), then we do not need
to kick the submission tasklet to evaluate whether we should be
preempting itself in order to execute it again.

In the case that was annoying me:

   execlists_schedule: rq(18:211173).prio=0 -> 2
   need_preempt: last(18:211174).prio=0, queue.prio=2

We are bumping the priority of the first of a pair of requests running
in the current context. Then when evaluating preempt, we would see that
that our priority request is higher than the last executing request in
ELSP0 and so trigger preemption, not realising that our intended request
was already executing.

v2: As we assume state of the execlists->port[] that is only valid while
we hold the timeline lock we have to repeat some earlier tests that on
the validity of the node.
v3: Wrap guc submission under the timeline.lock as is now the way of all
things.
