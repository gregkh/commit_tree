b43: Fix error in cordic routine

The cordic routine for calculating sines and cosines that was added in
commit 6f98e62a9f1b ("b43: update cordic code to match current specs")
contains an error whereby a quantity declared u32 can in fact go negative.

This problem was detected by Priit Laes who is switching b43 to use the
routine in the library functions of the kernel.
