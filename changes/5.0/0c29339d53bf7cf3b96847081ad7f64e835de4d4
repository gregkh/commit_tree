ARM: dts: imx6ul: Correct mask for GIC PPI interrupts

The GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE() macro should take as its argument the actual
number of CPU cores the interrupt controller is wired to.

i.MX6UL contains a single Cortex-A7, hence the second interrupt specifier
cell for Private Peripheral Interrupts should use "GIC_CPU_MASK_SIMPLE(1)".

Tested on a imx6ul-evk.
