batman-adv: Add includes for deprecation warning

The commit 00caf6a2b318 ("batman-adv: Mark debugfs functionality as
deprecated") introduced various messages to inform the user about the
deprecation of the debugfs based functionality. The messages also include
the context/task in which this problem was observed.

The datastructures and functions to access this information require special
headers. These should be included directly instead of depending on a more
complex and fragile include chain.
