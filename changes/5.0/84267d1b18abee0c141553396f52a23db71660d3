regmap: regmap-irq: Remove default irq type setting from core

The common code should not set IRQ type. Read HW defaults to the
cache at startup instead of forcing type to EDGE_BOTH. If
default setting is needed this should be done via normal
mechanisms or by chip specific code if normal mechanisms are not
suitable for some reason. Common regmap-irq code should not have
defaults hard-coded but keep the HW/boot defaults untouched.
