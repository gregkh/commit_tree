net: hns3: adjust the process of PF reset

When doing PF reset, the driver needs to do some preparatory work
before asserting PF reset. Since when hardware is resetting, it
is necessary to stop tx/rx queue, clear hardware table, etc,
otherwise hardware may run into unrecoverable state if there is
still IO running when the hardware is resetting.
