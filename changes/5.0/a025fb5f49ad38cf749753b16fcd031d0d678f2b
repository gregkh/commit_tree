geneve: Allow configuration of DF behaviour

draft-ietf-nvo3-geneve-08 says:

   It is strongly RECOMMENDED that Path MTU Discovery ([RFC1191],
   [RFC1981]) be used by setting the DF bit in the IP header when Geneve
   packets are transmitted over IPv4 (this is the default with IPv6).

Now that ICMP error handling is working for GENEVE, we can comply with
this recommendation.

Make this configurable, though, to avoid breaking existing setups. By
default, DF won't be set. It can be set or inherited from inner IPv4
packets. If it's configured to be inherited and we are encapsulating IPv6,
it will be set.

This only applies to non-lwt tunnels: if an external control plane is
used, tunnel key will still control the DF flag.

v2:
- DF behaviour configuration only applies for non-lwt tunnels, apply DF
  setting only if (!geneve->collect_md) in geneve_xmit_skb()
