ARM: imx: add initial support for imx7ulp

The i.MX 7ULP family of processors features NXP's advanced implementation
of the Arm Cortex-A7 core, the Arm Cortex-M4 core, as well as a 3D and 2D
Graphics Processing Units (GPUs).

This patch aims to add an initial support for imx7ulp. Note that we need
configure power mode to Partial Stop mode 3 with system/bus clock enabled
first as the default enabled STOP mode will gate off system/bus clock when
execute WFI in MX7ULP SoC.

And there's still no MXC_CPU_IMX7ULP IDs read from register as ULP has no
anatop as before. So we encode one with 0xff in reverse order in case new
ones will be in the future.
