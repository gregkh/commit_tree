x86/boot/compressed/64: Set EFER.LME=1 in 32-bit trampoline before returning to long mode

In some old AMD KVM implementation, guest's EFER.LME bit is cleared by KVM
when the hypervsior detects that the guest sets CR0.PG to 0. This causes
the guest OS to reboot when it tries to return from 32-bit trampoline code
because the CPU is in incorrect state: CR4.PAE=1, CR0.PG=1, CS.L=1, but
EFER.LME=0.  As a precaution, set EFER.LME=1 as part of long mode
activation procedure. This extra step won't cause any harm when Linux is
booted on a bare-metal machine.
