drm/amd/display: Fix MST reboot/poweroff sequence

[Why]

drm_dp_mst_topology_mgr_suspend() is added into the new reboot
sequence, which disables the UP request at the beginning.
Therefore sideband messages are blocked.

[How]

Finish MST sideband message transaction before UP request is
suppressed.
