net: hns3: provide some interface & information for the client

The client needs to know if the hardware is resetting when
loading or unloading itself, because client may abort the loading
process or wait for the reset process to finish when unloading
if hardware is resetting.

So this patch provides these interfaces to do it.
1. get_hw_reset_stat, the reset status of hardware.
2. ae_dev_resetting, whether reset task is scheduling.
3. ae_dev_reset_cnt, how many reset has been done.

Also, the RoCE client needs some field in the hnae3_roce_private_info
to save its state, and process_hw_error interface in the
hnae3_client_ops to process hardware errors.
