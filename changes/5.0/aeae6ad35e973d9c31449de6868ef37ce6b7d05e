mmc: sdhci-pci: Disable LED control for Intel BYT-based controllers

Intel BYT-based controllers do not have a LED signal line. Nevertheless
sdhci_led_control() takes more than twice as long as sdhci_send_command(),
even though it does nothing.  Use the new SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_LED quirk to
disable LED control for Intel BYT-based controllers.
