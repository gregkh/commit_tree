Btrfs: support swap files

Btrfs has not allowed swap files since commit 35054394c4b3 ("Btrfs: stop
providing a bmap operation to avoid swapfile corruptions"). However, now
that the proper restrictions are in place, Btrfs can support swap files
through the swap file a_ops, similar to iomap in commit 67482129cdab
("iomap: add a swapfile activation function").

For Btrfs, activation needs to make sure that the file can be used as a
swap file, which currently means that it must be fully allocated as
NOCOW with no compression on one device. It must also do the proper
tracking so that ioctls will not interfere with the swap file.
Deactivation clears this tracking.
