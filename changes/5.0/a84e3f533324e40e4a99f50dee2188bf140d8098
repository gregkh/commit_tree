xfrm: prefer secpath_set over secpath_dup

secpath_set is a wrapper for secpath_dup that will not perform
an allocation if the secpath attached to the skb has a reference count
of one, i.e., it doesn't need to be COW'ed.

Also, secpath_dup doesn't attach the secpath to the skb, it leaves
this to the caller.

Use secpath_set in places that immediately assign the return value to
skb.

This allows to remove skb->sp without touching these spots again.

secpath_dup can eventually be removed in followup patch.
