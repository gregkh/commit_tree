ipv6: Take rcu_read_lock in __inet6_bind for mapped addresses

I realized the last patch calls dev_get_by_index_rcu in a branch not
holding the rcu lock. Add the calls to rcu_read_lock and rcu_read_unlock.

Fixes: ec90ad334986 ("ipv6: Consider sk_bound_dev_if when binding a socket to a v4 mapped address")
