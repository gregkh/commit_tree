ext4: fix EXT4_IOC_GROUP_ADD ioctl

Commit e2b911c53584 ("ext4: clean up feature test macros with
predicate functions") broke the EXT4_IOC_GROUP_ADD ioctl.  This was
not noticed since only very old versions of resize2fs (before
e2fsprogs 1.42) use this ioctl.  However, using a new kernel with an
enterprise Linux userspace will cause attempts to use online resize to
fail with "No reserved GDT blocks".
