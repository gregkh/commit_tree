SUNRPC: add 'struct cred *' to auth_cred and rpc_cred

The SUNRPC credential framework was put together before
Linux has 'struct cred'.  Now that we have it, it makes sense to
use it.
This first step just includes a suitable 'struct cred *' pointer
in every 'struct auth_cred' and almost every 'struct rpc_cred'.

The rpc_cred used for auth_null has a NULL 'struct cred *' as nothing
else really makes sense.

For rpc_cred, the pointer is reference counted.
For auth_cred it isn't.  struct auth_cred are either allocated on
the stack, in which case the thread owns a reference to the auth,
or are part of 'struct generic_cred' in which case gc_base owns the
reference, and "acred" shares it.
