acpi/nfit, libnvdimm: Store dimm id as a member to struct nvdimm

The generated dimm id is needed for the sysfs attribute as well as being
used as the identifier/description for the security key. Since it's
constant and should never change, store it as a member of struct nvdimm.

As nvdimm_create() continues to grow parameters relative to NFIT driver
requirements, do not require other implementations to keep pace.
Introduce __nvdimm_create() to carry the new parameters and keep
nvdimm_create() with the long standing default api.
