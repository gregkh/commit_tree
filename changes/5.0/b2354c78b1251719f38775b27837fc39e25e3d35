drm/i915: Make pll functions take crtc_state, v2.

Instead of passing crtc and dereferencing crtc->config,
passs the correct crtc_state and obtain the crtc pointer from there.

Changes since v1:
- Move vlv/chv changes and i9xx_set_pll_dividers changes
  from crtc_enable/disable patches to here.
- Add commit message.
