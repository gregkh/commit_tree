drm/i915/icl: Program DSI clock and data lane timing params

This patch programs D-PHY timing parameters for the
clock and data lane (in escape clocks) of DSI
controller (DSI port 0 and 1).
These programmed timings would be used by DSI Controller
to calculate link transition latencies of the data and
clock lanes.

v2: Use newly defined bitfields for data and clock lane

v3 by Jani:
 - Rebase on dphy abstraction
 - Reduce local variables
 - Remove unrelated comment changes (Ville)
 - Use the same style for range checks as VLV (Ville)
 - Assign, don't OR dphy_reg contents
