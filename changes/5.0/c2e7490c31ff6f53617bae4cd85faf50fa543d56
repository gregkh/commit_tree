mlxsw: spectrum: Flip driver to use emulated 802.1Q FIDs

Replace 802.1Q FIDs and VLAN RIFs with their emulated counterparts.

The emulated 802.1Q FIDs are actually 802.1D FIDs and thus use the same
flood tables, of per-FID type. Therefore, add 4K-1 entries to the
per-FID flood tables for the new FIDs and get rid of the FID-offset
flood tables that were used by the old 802.1Q FIDs.
