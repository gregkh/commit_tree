kbuild: add -no-integrated-as Clang option unconditionally

We are still a way off the Clang's integrated assembler support for
the kernel. Hence, -no-integrated-as is mandatory to build the kernel
with Clang. If you had an ancient version of Clang that does not
recognize this option, you would not be able to compile the kernel
anyway.
