net/smc: preallocated memory for rdma work requests

The work requests for rdma writes are built in local variables within
function smc_tx_rdma_write(). This violates the rule that the work
request storage has to stay till the work request is confirmed by
a completion queue response.
This patch introduces preallocated memory for these work requests.
The storage is allocated, once a link (and thus a queue pair) is
established.
