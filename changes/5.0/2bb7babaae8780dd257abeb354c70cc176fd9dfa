ARM: dts: Remove unnecessary idle flags for omap5 uart3

Looks like I accidentally left some extra flags for uart3 to
not idle it. This happened as I generated the data from a
running system where these flags are set dynamically on boot
by omap_hwmod_setup_earlycon_flags() if earlycon is enabled.

We can just remove them.
