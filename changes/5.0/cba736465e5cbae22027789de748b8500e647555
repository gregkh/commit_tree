Bluetooth: hci_serdev: Remove setting of HCI_QUIRK_RESET_ON_CLOSE.

HCI_QUIRK_RESET_ON_CLOSE quirk is required for BT v1.0 based devices,
to send a reset command to the chip during hci device close. Serdev
architecture is used for the latest BT chips, which doesn't require to
send the reset command during close. If still chips required reset
command during close, it would be better enabling it in the vendor
probes or in proto setup.
