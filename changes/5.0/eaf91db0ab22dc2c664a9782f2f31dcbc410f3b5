reset: Add reset_control_get_count()

Currently the reset core has internal support for counting the number of
resets for a device described in DT.  Generalize this to devices using
lookup resets, and export it for public use.

This will be used by generic drivers that need to be sure a device is
controlled by a single, dedicated reset line (e.g. vfio-platform).
