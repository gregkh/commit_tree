drm/i915/psr: Get pipe id following atomic guidelines

As stated in struct drm_encoder, crtc field should only be used
by non-atomic drivers.

So here caching the pipe id in intel_psr_enable() what is way more
simple and efficient than at every call to
intel_psr_flush()/invalidate() get the
drm.mode_config.connection_mutex lock to safely be able to get the
pipe id by reading drm_connector_state.crtc.

This should fix the null pointer dereference crash below as the
previous way to get the pipe id was prone to race conditions.
