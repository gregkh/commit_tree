    drm: Compact booleans within struct drm_file

We do lockless access to these flags everywhere, and it's kinda not a
great idea to mix lockless and bitfields. Aside from that gcc isn't
generating great code for these.

If this ever becomes an issue size-wise, I think we need atomic_t here
and atomic bitflag ops.
