x86/microcode/AMD: Subtract SECTION_HDR_SIZE from file leftover length

verify_patch_size() verifies whether the remaining size of the microcode
container file is large enough to contain a patch of the indicated size.

However, the section header length is not included in this indicated
size but it is present in the leftover file length so it should be
subtracted from the leftover file length before passing this value to
verify_patch_size().
