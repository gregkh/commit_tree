netfilter: nat: limit port clash resolution attempts

In case almost or all available ports are taken, clash resolution can
take a very long time, resulting in soft lockup.

This can happen when many to-be-natted hosts connect to same
destination:port (e.g. a proxy) and all connections pass the same SNAT.

Pick a random offset in the acceptable range, then try ever smaller
number of adjacent port numbers, until either the limit is reached or a
useable port was found.  This results in at most 248 attempts
(128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8, i.e. 4 restarts with new search offset)
instead of 64000+,
