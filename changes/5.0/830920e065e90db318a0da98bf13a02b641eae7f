PCI: dwc: Use interrupt masking instead of disabling

The dwc driver is showing an interesting level of brokeness, as it
insists on using the enable/disable set of registers to mask/unmask
MSIs, meaning that an MSIs being generated while the interrupt is in
that "disabled" state will simply be lost.

Let's move to the mask/unmask set of registers, which offers the
expected semantics.
