s390/qeth: remove two IPA command helpers

qeth_l3_send_ipa_arp_cmd() is merely a wrapper around
qeth_send_control_data() now. So push the length adjustment into
QETH_SETASS_BASE_LEN, and remove the wrapper. While at it, also remove
some redundant 0-initializations.

qeth_send_setassparms() requires that callers prepare their command
parameters, so that they can be copied into the parameter area in one
go. Skip the indirection, and just let callers set up the command
themselves.
