y2038: signal: Add compat_sys_rt_sigtimedwait_time64

Now that 32-bit architectures have two variants of sys_rt_sigtimedwaid()
for 32-bit and 64-bit time_t, we also need to have a second compat system
call entry point on the corresponding 64-bit architectures.

The traditional system call keeps getting handled
by compat_sys_rt_sigtimedwait(), and this adds a new
compat_sys_rt_sigtimedwait_time64() that differs only in the timeout
argument type.

The naming remains a bit asymmetric for the moment. Ideally we would
want to have compat_sys_rt_sigtimedwait_time32() for the old version
and compat_sys_rt_sigtimedwait() for the new one to mirror the names
of the native entry points, but renaming the existing system call
tables causes unnecessary churn. I would suggest renaming all such
system calls together at a later point.
