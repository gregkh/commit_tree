xen/pvh: Move Xen specific PVH VM initialization out of common file

We need to refactor PVH entry code so that support for other hypervisors
like Qemu/KVM can be added more easily.

This patch moves the small block of code used for initializing Xen PVH
virtual machines into the Xen specific file. This initialization is not
going to be needed for Qemu/KVM guests. Moving it out of the common file
is going to allow us to compile kernels in the future without CONFIG_XEN
that are still capable of being booted as a Qemu/KVM guest via the PVH
entry point.
