clk: meson: meson8b: fix the offset of vid_pll_dco's N value

Unlike the other PLLs on Meson8b the N value "vid_pll_dco" (a better
name would be hdmi_pll_dco or - as the datasheet calls it - HPLL) is
located at HHI_VID_PLL_CNTL[14:10] instead of [13:9].
This results in an incorrect calculation of the rate of this PLL because
the value seen by the kernel is double the actual N (divider) value.
Update the offset of the N value to fix the calculation of the PLL rate.
