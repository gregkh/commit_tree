tools: bpftool: use "/proc/self/" i.o. crafting links with getpid()

The getpid() function is called in a couple of places in bpftool to
craft links of the shape "/proc/<pid>/...". Instead, it is possible to
use the "/proc/self/" shortcut, which makes things a bit easier, in
particular in jit_disasm.c.

Do the replacement, and remove the includes of <sys/types.h> from the
relevant files, now we do not use getpid() anymore.
