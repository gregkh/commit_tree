audit: Simplify locking around untag_chunk()

untag_chunk() has to be called with hash_lock, it drops it and
reacquires it when returning. The unlocking of hash_lock is thus hidden
from the callers of untag_chunk() with is rather error prone. Reorganize
the code so that untag_chunk() is called without hash_lock, only with
mark reference preventing the chunk from going away.

Since this requires some more code in the caller of untag_chunk() to
assure forward progress, factor out loop pruning tree from all chunks
into a common helper function.
