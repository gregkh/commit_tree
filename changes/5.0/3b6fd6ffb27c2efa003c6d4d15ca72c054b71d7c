drivers/base/memory.c: remove an unnecessary check on NR_MEM_SECTIONS

In cb5e39b8038b ("drivers: base: refactor add_memory_section() to
add_memory_block()"), add_memory_block() is introduced, which is only
invoked in memory_dev_init().

When combining these two loops in memory_dev_init() and
add_memory_block(), they looks like this:

    for (i = 0; i < NR_MEM_SECTIONS; i += sections_per_block)
        for (j = i;
	    (j < i + sections_per_block) && j < NR_MEM_SECTIONS;
	    j++)

Since it is sure the (i < NR_MEM_SECTIONS) and j sits in its own memory
block, the check of (j < NR_MEM_SECTIONS) is not necessary.

This patch just removes this check.
