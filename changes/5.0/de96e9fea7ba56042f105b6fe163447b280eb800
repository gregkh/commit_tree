sysfs: convert BUG_ON to WARN_ON

It's rude to crash the system just because the developer did something
wrong, as it prevents them from usually even seeing what went wrong.

So convert the few BUG_ON() calls that have snuck into the sysfs code
over the years to WARN_ON() to make it more "friendly".  All of these
are able to be recovered from, so it makes no sense to crash.
