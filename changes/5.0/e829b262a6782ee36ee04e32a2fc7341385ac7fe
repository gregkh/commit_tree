media: uvcvideo: Protect queue internals with helper

The URB completion operation obtains the current buffer by reading
directly into the queue internal interface.

Protect this queue abstraction by providing a helper
uvc_queue_get_current_buffer() which can be used by both the decode
task, and the uvc_queue_next_buffer() functions.
