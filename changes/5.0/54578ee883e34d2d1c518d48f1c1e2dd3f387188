usb: musb: dsps: fix runtime pm for peripheral mode

Since the runtime PM support was added in musb, dsps relies on the timer
calling otg_timer() to activate the usb subsystem. However the driver
doesn't enable the timer for peripheral port, then the peripheral port is
unable to be enumerated by a host if the other usb port is disabled or in
peripheral mode too.

So let's start the timer for peripheral port too.
