net: remove unsafe skb_insert()

I do not see how one can effectively use skb_insert() without holding
some kind of lock. Otherwise other cpus could have changed the list
right before we have a chance of acquiring list->lock.

Only existing user is in drivers/infiniband/hw/nes/nes_mgt.c and this
one probably meant to use __skb_insert() since it appears nesqp->pau_list
is protected by nesqp->pau_lock. This looks like nesqp->pau_lock
could be removed, since nesqp->pau_list.lock could be used instead.
