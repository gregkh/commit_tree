arm/arm64: KVM: Add ARM_EXCEPTION_IS_TRAP macro

32 and 64bit use different symbols to identify the traps.
32bit has a fine grained approach (prefetch abort, data abort and HVC),
while 64bit is pretty happy with just "trap".

This has been fine so far, except that we now need to decode some
of that in tracepoints that are common to both architectures.

Introduce ARM_EXCEPTION_IS_TRAP which abstracts the trap symbols
and make the tracepoint use it.
