bcache: add comment for cache_set->fill_iter

We have the following define for btree iterator:
	struct btree_iter {
		size_t size, used;
	#ifdef CONFIG_BCACHE_DEBUG
		struct btree_keys *b;
	#endif
		struct btree_iter_set {
			struct bkey *k, *end;
		} data[MAX_BSETS];
	};

We can see that the length of data[] field is static MAX_BSETS, which is
defined as 4 currently.

But a btree node on disk could have too many bsets for an iterator to fit
on the stack - maybe far more that MAX_BSETS. Have to dynamically allocate
space to host more btree_iter_sets.

bch_cache_set_alloc() will make sure the pool cache_set->fill_iter can
allocate an iterator equipped with enough room that can host
	(sb.bucket_size / sb.block_size)
btree_iter_sets, which is more than static MAX_BSETS.

bch_btree_node_read_done() will use that pool to allocate one iterator, to
host many bsets in one btree node.

Add more comment around cache_set->fill_iter to make code less confusing.
