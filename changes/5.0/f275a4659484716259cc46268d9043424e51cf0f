i2c: bcm2835: Clear current buffer pointers and counts after a transfer

The driver's interrupt handler checks whether a message is currently
being handled with the curr_msg pointer. When it is NULL, the interrupt
is considered to be unexpected. Similarly, the i2c_start_transfer
routine checks for the remaining number of messages to handle in
num_msgs.

However, these values are never cleared and always keep the message and
number relevant to the latest transfer (which might be done already and
the underlying message memory might have been freed).

When an unexpected interrupt hits with the DONE bit set, the isr will
then try to access the flags field of the curr_msg structure, leading
to a fatal page fault.

The msg_buf and msg_buf_remaining fields are also never cleared at the
end of the transfer, which can lead to similar pitfalls.

Fix these issues by introducing a cleanup function and always calling
it after a transfer is finished.
