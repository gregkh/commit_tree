usb: musb: dsps: fix otg state machine

Due to lack of ID pin interrupt event on AM335x devices, the musb dsps
driver uses polling to detect usb device attach for dual-role port.

But in the case if a micro-A cable adapter is attached without a USB device
attached to the cable, the musb state machine gets stuck in a_wait_vrise
state waiting for the MUSB_CONNECT interrupt which won't happen due to the
usb device is not attached. The state is stuck in a_wait_vrise even after
the micro-A cable is detached, which could cause VBUS retention if then the
dual-role port is attached to a host port.

To fix the problem, make a_wait_vrise as a transient state, then move the
state to either a_wait_bcon for host port or a_idle state for dual-role
port, if no usb device is attached to the port.
