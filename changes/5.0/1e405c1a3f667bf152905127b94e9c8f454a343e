xsk: do not remove umem from netdevice on fall-back to copy-mode

Commit c9b47cc1fabc ("xsk: fix bug when trying to use both copy and
zero-copy on one queue id") stores the umem into the netdev._rx
struct. However, the patch incorrectly removed the umem from the
netdev._rx struct when user-space passed "best-effort" mode
(i.e. select the fastest possible option available), and zero-copy
mode was not available. This commit fixes that.
