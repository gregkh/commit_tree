powerpc/tm: Unset MSR[TS] if not recheckpointing

There is a TM Bad Thing bug that can be caused when you return from a
signal context in a suspended transaction but with ucontext MSR[TS] unset.

This forces regs->msr[TS] to be set at syscall entrance (since the CPU
state is transactional). It also calls treclaim() to flush the transaction
state, which is done based on the live (mfmsr) MSR state.

Since user context MSR[TS] is not set, then restore_tm_sigcontexts() is not
called, thus, not executing recheckpoint, keeping the CPU state as not
transactional. When calling rfid, SRR1 will have MSR[TS] set, but the CPU
state is non transactional, causing the TM Bad Thing with the following
stack:

	WARNING: exception is not recoverable, can't continue

The same problem happens on 32-bits signal handler, and the fix is very
similar, if tm_recheckpoint() is not executed, then regs->msr[TS] should be
zeroed.

This patch also fixes a sparse warning related to lack of indentation when
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM is set.
