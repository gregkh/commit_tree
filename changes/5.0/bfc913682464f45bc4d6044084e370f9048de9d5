alpha: Fix Eiger NR_IRQS to 128

Eiger machine vector definition has nr_irqs 128, and working 2.6.26
boot shows SCSI getting IRQ-s 64 and 65. Current kernel boot fails
because Symbios SCSI fails to request IRQ-s and does not find the disks.
It has been broken at least since 3.18 - the earliest I could test with
my gcc-5.

The headers have moved around and possibly another order of defines has
worked in the past - but since 128 seems to be correct and used, fix
arch/alpha/include/asm/irq.h to have NR_IRQS=128 for Eiger.

This fixes 4.19-rc7 boot on my Force Flexor A264 (Eiger subarch).
