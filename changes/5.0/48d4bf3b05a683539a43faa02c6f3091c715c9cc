staging: erofs: separate into init_once / always

`z_erofs_vle_workgroup' is heavily generated in the decompression,
for example, it resets 32 bytes redundantly for 64-bit platforms
even through Z_EROFS_VLE_INLINE_PAGEVECS + Z_EROFS_CLUSTER_MAX_PAGES,
default 4, pages are stored in `z_erofs_vle_workgroup'.

As an another example, `struct mutex' takes 72 bytes for our kirin
64-bit platforms, it's unnecessary to be reseted at first and
be initialized each time.

Let's avoid filling all `z_erofs_vle_workgroup' with 0 at first
since most fields are reinitialized to meaningful values later,
and pagevec is no need to initialized at all.
