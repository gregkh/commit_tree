soc/tegra: bpmp: Update ABI header

Update the firmware header file to a more recent version. The major
changes in the new version are:

 * add a new MRQ for firmware version query ABI and deprecates the old
 * add ABI to query Tegra194 CPU frequency limits
 * add ABI to control subset of PCIE UPHY state

The new header contains also some editorial changes to the
documentation.
