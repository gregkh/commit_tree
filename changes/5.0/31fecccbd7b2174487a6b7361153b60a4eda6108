btrfs: remove redundant csum buffer in btrfs_io_bio

The io_bio tracks checksums and has an inline buffer or an allocated
one. And there's a third member that points to the right one, but we
don't need to use an extra pointer for that. Let btrfs_io_bio::csum
point to the right buffer and check that the inline buffer is not
accidentally freed.

This shrinks struct btrfs_io_bio by 8 bytes.
