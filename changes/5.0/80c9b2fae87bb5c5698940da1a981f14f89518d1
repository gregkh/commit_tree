bpf: add various test cases to selftests

Add various map value pointer related test cases to test_verifier
kselftest to reflect recent changes and improve test coverage. The
tests include basic masking functionality, unprivileged behavior
on pointer arithmetic which goes oob, mixed bounds tests, negative
unknown scalar but resulting positive offset for access and helper
range, handling of arithmetic from multiple maps, various masking
scenarios with subsequent map value access and others including two
test cases from Jann Horn for prior fixes.
