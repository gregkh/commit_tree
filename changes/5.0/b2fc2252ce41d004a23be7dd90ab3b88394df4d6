drm/i915/psr: Always wait for idle state when disabling PSR

It should always wait for idle state when disabling PSR because PSR
could be inactive due a call to intel_psr_exit() and while PSR is
still being disabled asynchronously userspace could change the
modeset causing a call to psr_disable() that will not wait for PSR
idle and then PSR will be enabled again while PSR is still not idle.

v2: rebased on top of the patch reusing psr_exit()
