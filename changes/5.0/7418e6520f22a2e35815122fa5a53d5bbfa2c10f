isdn: hisax: hfc_pci: Fix a possible concurrency use-after-free bug in HFCPCI_l1hw()

In drivers/isdn/hisax/hfc_pci.c, the functions hfcpci_interrupt() and
HFCPCI_l1hw() may be concurrently executed.

HFCPCI_l1hw()
  line 1173: if (!cs->tx_skb)

hfcpci_interrupt()
  line 942: spin_lock_irqsave();
  line 1066: dev_kfree_skb_irq(cs->tx_skb);

Thus, a possible concurrency use-after-free bug may occur
in HFCPCI_l1hw().

To fix these bugs, the calls to spin_lock_irqsave() and
spin_unlock_irqrestore() are added in HFCPCI_l1hw(), to protect the
access to cs->tx_skb.
