MIPS: Remove superfluous check for __linux__

When building BPF code using "clang -target bpf -c", clang does not
define __linux__.

To build BPF IR decoders the include linux/lirc.h is needed which
includes linux/types.h. Currently this workaround is needed:

This check might otherwise be useful to stop users from using a non-linux
compiler, but if you're doing that you are going to have a lot more
trouble anyway.
