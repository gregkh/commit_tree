MIPS: malta: Use img-ascii-lcd driver for LCD display

Remove the Malta display platform code in favour of probing the
img-ascii-lcd driver via device tree. This reduces the amount of
platform code & the img-ascii-lcd driver offers us advantages in terms
of code sharing with other boards & functionality such as changing the
displayed message via sysfs. Defconfigs are untouched because the driver
already defaults y on when CONFIG_MIPS_MALTA=y.
