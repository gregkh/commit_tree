KVM: arm/arm64: Fixup the kvm_exit tracepoint

The kvm_exit tracepoint strangely always reported exits as being IRQs.
This seems to be because either the __print_symbolic or the tracepoint
macros use a variable named idx.

Take this chance to update the fields in the tracepoint to reflect the
concepts in the arm64 architecture that we pass to the tracepoint and
move the exception type table to the same location and header files as
the exits code.

We also clear out the exception code to 0 for IRQ exits (which
translates to UNKNOWN in text) to make it slighyly less confusing to
parse the trace output.
