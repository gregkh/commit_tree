tty: Don't hold ldisc lock in tty_reopen() if ldisc present

Try to get reference for ldisc during tty_reopen().
If ldisc present, we don't need to do tty_ldisc_reinit() and lock the
write side for line discipline semaphore.
Effectively, it optimizes fast-path for tty_reopen(), but more
importantly it won't interrupt ongoing IO on the tty as no ldisc change
is needed.
Fixes user-visible issue when tty_reopen() interrupted login process for
user with a long password, observed and reported by Lukas.
