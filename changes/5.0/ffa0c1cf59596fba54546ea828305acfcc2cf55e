bpf: enable cgroup local storage map pretty print with kind_flag

Commit 970289fc0a83 ("bpf: add bpffs pretty print for cgroup
local storage maps") added bpffs pretty print for cgroup
local storage maps. The commit worked for struct without kind_flag
set.

This patch refactored and made pretty print also work
with kind_flag set for the struct.
