of/fdt: Remove custom __early_init_dt_declare_initrd() implementation

Now that ARM64 uses phys_initrd_start/phys_initrd_size, we can get rid
of its custom __early_init_dt_declare_initrd() which causes a fair
amount of objects rebuild when changing CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD. In order
to make sure ARM64 does not produce a BUG() when VM debugging is turned
on though, we must avoid early calls to __va() which is what
__early_init_dt_declare_initrd() does and wrap this around to avoid
running that code on ARM64.
