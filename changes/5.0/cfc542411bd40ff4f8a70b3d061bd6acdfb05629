tools/bpf: rename *_info_cnt to nr_*_info

Rename all occurances of *_info_cnt field access
to nr_*_info in tools directory.

The local variables finfo_cnt, linfo_cnt and jited_linfo_cnt
in function do_dump() of tools/bpf/bpftool/prog.c are also
changed to nr_finfo, nr_linfo and nr_jited_linfo to
keep naming convention consistent.
