xfs: xfs_fsops: drop useless LIST_HEAD

Drop LIST_HEAD where the variable it declares is never used.

Commit 0410c3bb2b88 ("xfs: factor ag btree root block
initialisation") stopped using buffer_list and started using a
buffer list in an aghdr_init_data structure, but the declaration
of buffer_list was not removed.

The semantic patch that fixes this problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
identifier x;
@@
- LIST_HEAD(x);
  ... when != x
// </smpl>
