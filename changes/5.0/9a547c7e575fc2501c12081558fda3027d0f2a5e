audit: shorten PATH cap values when zero

Since the vast majority of files (99.993% on a typical system) have no
fcaps, display "0" instead of the full zero-padded 16 hex digits in the
two PATH record cap_f* fields to save netlink bandwidth and disk space.

Simply changing the format to %x won't work since the value is two (or
possibly more in the future) 32-bit hexadecimal values concatenated and
bits in higher order values will be misrepresented.

Passes audit-testsuite and userspace tools already work fine.
