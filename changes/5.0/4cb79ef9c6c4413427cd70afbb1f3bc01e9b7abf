ASoC: amd: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

Check return value from call to devm_kzalloc() in order to prevent a
potential NULL pointer dereference.

Also, notice that it makes no sense to allocate any resources if
res = platform_get_resource(pdev, IORESOURCE_MEM, 0); fails,
so move the call to devm_kzalloc() below the mentioned code.

Lastly, improve the use of sizeof in the call to devm_kzalloc() by
changing it from sizeof(struct i2s_dev_data) to sizeof(*adata)

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
