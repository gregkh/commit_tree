gpu: drm: radeon: Set DPM_FLAG_NEVER_SKIP when enabling PM-runtime

On HP ProBook 4540s, if PM-runtime is enabled in the radeon driver
and the direct-complete optimization is used for the radeon device
during system-wide suspend, the system doesn't resume.

Preventing direct-complete from being used with the radeon device by
setting the DPM_FLAG_NEVER_SKIP driver flag for it makes the problem
go away, which indicates that direct-complete is not safe for the
radeon driver in general and should not be used with it (at least
for now).

This fixes a regression introduced by commit c62ec4610c40
("PM / core: Fix direct_complete handling for devices with no
callbacks") which allowed direct-complete to be applied to
devices without PM callbacks (again) which in turn unlocked
direct-complete for radeon on HP ProBook 4540s.
