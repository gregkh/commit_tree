drm/i915/dp: Do not grab crtc modeset lock in intel_dp_detect()

A crtc modeset lock was added for link retraining but
intel_dp_retrain_link() knows to take the necessary locks since
commit c85d200e8321 ("drm/i915: Move SST DP link retraining into the
->post_hotplug() hook")
v2: Drop AUX power domain reference in the early return path

Fixes: c85d200e8321 ("drm/i915: Move SST DP link retraining into the ->post_hotplug() hook")
