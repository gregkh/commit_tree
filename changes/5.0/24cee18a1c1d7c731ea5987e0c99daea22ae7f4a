btrfs: Remove extraneous extent_buffer_get from tree_mod_log_rewind

When a rewound buffer is created it already has a ref count of 1 and the
dummy flag set. Then another ref is taken bumping the count to 2.
Finally when this buffer is released from btrfs_release_path the extra
reference is decremented by the special handling code in
free_extent_buffer.

However, this special code is in fact redundant sinca ref count of 1 is
still correct since the buffer is only accessed via btrfs_path struct.
This paves the way forward of removing the special handling in
free_extent_buffer.
