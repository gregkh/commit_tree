crypto: x86/chacha20 - Add a 2-block AVX-512VL variant

This version uses the same principle as the AVX2 version. It benefits
from the AVX-512VL rotate instructions and the more efficient partial
block handling using "vmovdqu8", resulting in a speedup of ~20%.

Unlike the AVX2 version, it is faster than the single block SSSE3 version
to process a single block. Hence we engage that function for (partial)
single block lengths as well.
