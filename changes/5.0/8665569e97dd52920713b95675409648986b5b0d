pstore/ram: Avoid NULL deref in ftrace merging failure path

Given corruption in the ftrace records, it might be possible to allocate
tmp_prz without assigning prz to it, but still marking it as needing to
be freed, which would cause at least a NULL dereference.

smatch warnings:
fs/pstore/ram.c:340 ramoops_pstore_read() error: we previously assumed 'prz' could be null (see line 255)
