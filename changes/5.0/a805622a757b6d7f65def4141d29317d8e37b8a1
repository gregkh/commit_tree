ext4: include terminating u32 in size of xattr entries when expanding inodes

In ext4_expand_extra_isize_ea(), we calculate the total size of the
xattr header, plus the xattr entries so we know how much of the
beginning part of the xattrs to move when expanding the inode extra
size.  We need to include the terminating u32 at the end of the xattr
entries, or else if there is uninitialized, non-zero bytes after the
xattr entries and before the xattr values, the list of xattr entries
won't be properly terminated.
