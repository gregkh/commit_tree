drm/sun4i: hdmi: Fix usage of TMDS clock

Although TMDS clock is required for HDMI to properly function,
nobody called clk_prepare_enable(). This fixes reference counting
issues and makes sure clock is running when it needs to be running.

Due to TDMS clock being parent clock for DDC clock, TDMS clock
was turned on/off for each EDID probe, causing spurious failures
for certain HDMI/DVI screens.
