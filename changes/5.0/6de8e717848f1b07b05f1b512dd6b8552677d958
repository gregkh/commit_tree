arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: enable sound on Pinebook

The Pinebook has a headphone jack tied to the HP headphone output of
the SoC, and internal speakers connected to the LINEOUT of the SoC,
through a standalone amplifier.

This commit enables I2S, digital and analog parts of audio codec on
Pinebook, along with a device node for the external amplifier.
