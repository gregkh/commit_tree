btrfs: Remove extent_io_ops::check_extent_io_range callback

This callback was only used in debug builds by btrfs_leak_debug_check.
A better approach is to move its implementation in
btrfs_leak_debug_check and ensure the latter is only executed for extent
tree which have ->private_data set i.e. relate to a data node and not
the btree one. No functional changes.
