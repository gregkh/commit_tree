dt-bindings: clock: Require #reset-cells in sdm845-videocc

The #reset-cells was listed as optional in the bindings for
qcom,sdm845-videocc.  There's no reason for it to be optional.  As per
Stephen [1]:

> We should update the binding to make it a required property. It

sdm845 support is still in its infancy so we shouldn't be affecting
any real device trees by modifying the bindings here.
