ASoC: meson: axg-toddr: add support for spdifin backend

add IEC958_SUBFRAME_LE to the list of format accepted by the fifo frontend.

As opposed to what was initially noted in the toddr dai driver, the spdifin
does not place the msb at bit 28, it just output a whole spdif subframe.

Placing the msb at bit 28 in the toddr driver just filters out the parity,
user, channel status and validity bits. It is better to just provide the
whole spdif subframe to the userspace and let the iec958 plugin deal with
it.
