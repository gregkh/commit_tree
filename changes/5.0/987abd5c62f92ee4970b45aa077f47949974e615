drm/i915/execlists: Force write serialisation into context image vs execution

Ensure that the writes into the context image are completed prior to the
register mmio to trigger execution. Although previously we were assured
by the SDM that all writes are flushed before an uncached memory
transaction (our mmio write to submit the context to HW for execution),
we have empirical evidence to believe that this is not actually the
case.
