netfilter: nf_conncount: replace CONNCOUNT_LOCK_SLOTS with CONNCOUNT_SLOTS

Most of the time these were the same value anyway, but when
CONFIG_LOCKDEP was enabled we would use a smaller number of locks to
reduce overhead.  Unfortunately having two values is confusing and not
worth the complexity.

This fixes a bug where tree_gc_worker() would only GC up to
CONNCOUNT_LOCK_SLOTS trees which meant when CONFIG_LOCKDEP was enabled
not all trees would be GCed by tree_gc_worker().
