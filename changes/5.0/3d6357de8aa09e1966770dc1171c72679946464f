mm: reference totalram_pages and managed_pages once per function

Patch series "mm: convert totalram_pages, totalhigh_pages and managed
pages to atomic", v5.

This series converts totalram_pages, totalhigh_pages and
zone->managed_pages to atomic variables.

totalram_pages, zone->managed_pages and totalhigh_pages updates are
protected by managed_page_count_lock, but readers never care about it.
Convert these variables to atomic to avoid readers potentially seeing a
store tear.

Main motivation was that managed_page_count_lock handling was complicating
things.  It was discussed in length here,
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/995739/#1181785 It seemes better
to remove the lock and convert variables to atomic.  With the change,
preventing poteintial store-to-read tearing comes as a bonus.

This patch (of 4):

This is in preparation to a later patch which converts totalram_pages and
zone->managed_pages to atomic variables.  Please note that re-reading the
value might lead to a different value and as such it could lead to
unexpected behavior.  There are no known bugs as a result of the current
code but it is better to prevent from them in principle.
