sched: Avoid dereferencing skb pointer after child enqueue

Parent qdiscs may dereference the pointer to the enqueued skb after
enqueue. However, both CAKE and TBF call consume_skb() on the original skb
when splitting GSO packets, leading to a potential use-after-free in the
parent. Fix this by avoiding dereferencing the skb pointer after enqueueing
to the child.
