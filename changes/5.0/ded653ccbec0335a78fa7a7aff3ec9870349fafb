signal: Add set_user_sigmask()

Refactor reading sigset from userspace and updating sigmask
into an api.

This is useful for versions of syscalls that pass in the
sigmask and expect the current->sigmask to be changed during,
and restored after, the execution of the syscall.

With the advent of new y2038 syscalls in the subsequent patches,
we add two more new versions of the syscalls (for pselect, ppoll,
and io_pgetevents) in addition to the existing native and compat
versions. Adding such an api reduces the logic that would need to
be replicated otherwise.

Note that the calls to sigprocmask() ignored the return value
from the api as the function only returns an error on an invalid
first argument that is hardcoded at these call sites.
The updated logic uses set_current_blocked() instead.
