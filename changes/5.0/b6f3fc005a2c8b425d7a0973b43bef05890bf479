ASoC: simple-card-utils: fixup asoc_simple_card_get_dai_id() counting

asoc_simple_card_get_dai_id() returns DAI ID, but it is based on
DT node's "endpoint" position.
Almost all cases 1 port has 1 endpoint, thus, it was no problem.
But in reality, port : endpoint = 1 : N, thus, counting endpoint
is BUG, it should based on "port" ID.
This patch fixup it.
