sctp: Fix SKB list traversal in sctp_intl_store_reasm().

To be fully correct, an iterator has an undefined value when something
like skb_queue_walk() naturally terminates.

This will actually matter when SKB queues are converted over to
list_head.

Formalize what this code ends up doing with the current
implementation.
