gpiolib: fix line event timestamps for nested irqs

Nested interrupts run inside the calling thread's context and the top
half handler is never called which means that we never read the
timestamp.

This issue came up when trying to read line events from a gpiochip
using regmap_irq_chip for interrupts.

Fix it by reading the timestamp from the irq thread function if it's
still 0 by the time the second handler is called.
