usb: gadget: udc: net2272: Fix bitwise and boolean operations

(!x & y) strikes again.

Fix bitwise and boolean operations by enclosing the expression:

	intcsr & (1 << NET2272_PCI_IRQ)

in parentheses, before applying the boolean operator '!'.

Notice that this code has been there since 2011. So, it would
be helpful if someone can double-check this.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
