tools: bpftool: fix -Wmissing declaration warnings

Help compiler check arguments for several utility functions used to
print items to the console by adding the "printf" attribute when
declaring those functions.

Also, declare as "static" two functions that are only used in prog.c.

All of them discovered by compiling bpftool with
-Wmissing-format-attribute -Wmissing-declarations.
