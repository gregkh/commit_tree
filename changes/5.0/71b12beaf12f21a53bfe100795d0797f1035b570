platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: Drop mapping of 0x33 and 0x34 scan codes

According to Asus firmware engineers, the meaning of these codes is only
to notify the OS that the screen brightness has been turned on/off by
the EC. This does not match the meaning of KEY_DISPLAYTOGGLE /
KEY_DISPLAY_OFF, where userspace is expected to change the display
brightness.
