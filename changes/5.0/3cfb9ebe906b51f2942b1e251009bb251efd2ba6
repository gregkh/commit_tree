powerpc/44x/bamboo: Fix PCI range

The bamboo dts has a bug: it uses a non-naturally aligned range
for PCI memory space. This isnt' supported by the code, thus
causing PCI to break on this system.

This is due to the fact that while the chip memory map has 1G
reserved for PCI memory, it's only 512M aligned. The code doesn't
know how to split that into 2 different PMMs and fails, so limit
the region to 512M.
