svcrdma: Optimize the logic that selects the R_key to invalidate

o Select the R_key to invalidate while the CPU cache still contains
  the received RPC Call transport header, rather than waiting until
  we're about to send the RPC Reply.

o Choose Send With Invalidate if there is exactly one distinct R_key
  in the received transport header. If there's more than one, the
  client will have to perform local invalidation after it has
  already waited for remote invalidation.
