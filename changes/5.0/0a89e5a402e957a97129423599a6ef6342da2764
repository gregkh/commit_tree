rcu: Trace end of grace period before end of grace period

Currently, rcu_gp_cleanup() traces the end of the old grace period after
the old grace period has officially ended.  This might make intuitive
sense, but it also makes for confusing event-trace output because the
"end" trace displays not the old but instead the new grace-period number.
This commit therefore traces the end of an old grace period just before
that grace period officially ends.
