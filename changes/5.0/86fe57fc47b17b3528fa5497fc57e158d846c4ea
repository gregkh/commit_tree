clocksource/drivers/fttmr010: Fix invalid interrupt register access

TIMER_INTR_MASK register (Base Address of Timer + 0x38) is not designed
for masking interrupts on ast2500 chips, and it's not even listed in
ast2400 datasheet, so it's not safe to access TIMER_INTR_MASK on aspeed
chips.

Similarly, TIMER_INTR_STATE register (Base Address of Timer + 0x34) is
not interrupt status register on ast2400 and ast2500 chips. Although
there is no side effect to reset the register in fttmr010_common_init(),
it's just misleading to do so.

Besides, "count_down" is renamed to "is_aspeed" in "fttmr010" structure,
and more comments are added so the code is more readble.
