ip6_gre: fix tunnel list corruption for x-netns

In changelink ops, the ip6gre_net pointer is retrieved from
dev_net(dev), which is wrong in case of x-netns. Thus, the tunnel is not
unlinked from its current list and is relinked into another net
namespace. This corrupts the tunnel lists and can later trigger a kernel
oops.

Fix this by retrieving the netns from device private area.
