clk: meson: meson8b: add the fractional divider for vid_pll_dco

This "vid_pll_dco" (which should be named HDMI_PLL or - as the datasheet
calls it - HPLL) has a 12-bit wide fractional parameter at
HHI_VID_PLL_CNTL2[11:0]. Add this so we correctly calculate the rate of
this PLL when u-boot is configured for a video mode which uses this
fractional parameter.
