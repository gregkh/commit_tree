crypto: arm64/chacha - use combined SIMD/ALU routine for more speed

To some degree, most known AArch64 micro-architectures appear to be
able to issue ALU instructions in parellel to SIMD instructions
without affecting the SIMD throughput. This means we can use the ALU
to process a fifth ChaCha block while the SIMD is processing four
blocks in parallel.
