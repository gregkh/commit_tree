drm/i915: Priority boost for new clients

Taken from an idea used for FQ_CODEL, we give the first request of a
new request flows a small priority boost. These flows are likely to
correspond with short, interactive tasks and so be more latency sensitive
than the longer free running queues. As soon as the client has more than
one request in the queue, further requests are not boosted and it settles
down into ordinary steady state behaviour.  Such small kicks dramatically
help combat the starvation issue, by allowing each client the opportunity
to run even when the system is under heavy throughput load (within the
constraints of the user selected priority).

v2: Mark the preempted request as the start of a new flow, to prevent a
single client being continually gazumped by its peers.
