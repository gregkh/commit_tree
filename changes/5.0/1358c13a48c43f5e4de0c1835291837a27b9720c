crypto: ccree - fix resume race condition on init

We were enabling autosuspend, which is using data set by the
hash module, prior to the hash module being inited, casuing
a crash on resume as part of the startup sequence if the race
was lost.

This was never a real problem because the PM infra was using low
res timers so we were always winning the race, until commit 8234f6734c5d
("PM-runtime: Switch autosuspend over to using hrtimers") changed that :-)

Fix this by seperating the PM setup and enablement and doing the
latter only at the end of the init sequence.
