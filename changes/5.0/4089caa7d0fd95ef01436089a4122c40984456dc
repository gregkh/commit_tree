MIPS: OCTEON: delete redundant register definitions

For most OCTEON SoCs there is a repeated and redundant register definition
for almost every hardware register, although the register bit fields
would not differ from other SoCs. Since the driver code should use only
one definition for simplicity, these other fields are just redundant
and can be deleted.
