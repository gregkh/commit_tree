scsi: zfcp: drop unnecessary forward prototype for struct zfcp_reqlist

While struct zfcp_adapter contains a pointer to zfcp_reqlist, the pointer
field does not need to know the structure or even a prototype.

The prototype was introduced with v2.6.34 commit b6bd2fb92a7b ("[SCSI]
zfcp: Move FSF request tracking code to new file").
