KVM: MMU: record maximum physical address width in kvm_mmu_extended_role

Previously, commit 7dcd57552008 ("x86/kvm/mmu: check if tdp/shadow
MMU reconfiguration is needed") offered some optimization to avoid
the unnecessary reconfiguration. Yet one scenario is broken - when
cpuid changes VM's maximum physical address width, reconfiguration
is needed to reset the reserved bits.  Also, the TDP may need to
reset its shadow_root_level when this value is changed.

To fix this, a new field, maxphyaddr, is introduced in the extended
role structure to keep track of the configured guest physical address
width.
