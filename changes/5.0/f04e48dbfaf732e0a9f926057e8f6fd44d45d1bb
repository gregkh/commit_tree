qede: Update link status only when interface is ready.

In the case of internal reload (e.g., mtu change), there could be a race
between link-up notification from mfw and the driver unload processing. In
such case kernel assumes the link is up and starts using the queues which
leads to the server crash.

Send link notification to the kernel only when driver has already requested
MFW for the link.
