ath10k: assign proper firmware crash dump structure

ar->target_version is same for QCA99x0, QCA4019, QCA9888
and QCA9984, this ended up in assigning the wrong hw_mem_layouts.
This patch adds additional hw_rev check to assign correct
hw_mem_layouts.

Tested on:
QCA4019 firmware 10.4-3.2.1.1-00017
QCA9984 firmware 10.4-3.5.3-00057
