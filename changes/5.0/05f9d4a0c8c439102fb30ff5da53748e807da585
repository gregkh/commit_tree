staging: erofs: use the new LZ4_decompress_safe_partial()

LZ4_decompress_safe_partial() can now decode exactly the nb of bytes
requested after the upstreamed commit 2209fda323e2 ("lib/lz4: update LZ4
decompressor module"), remove the erofs hacked lz4 decompression code.

A more cleaned compressor wrapper will be introduced in the subsequent
patches in order to prepare for supporting multiple compression algorithms.
