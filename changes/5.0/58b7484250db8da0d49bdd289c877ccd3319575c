cpuset: Define data structures to support scheduling partition

>From a cpuset point of view, a scheduling partition is a group of
cpusets with their own set of exclusive CPUs that are not shared by
other tasks outside the scheduling partition.

In the legacy hierarchy, scheduling partitions are supported indirectly
via the right use of the load balancing and the exclusive CPUs flag
which is not intuitive and can be hard to use.

To fully support the concept of scheduling partitions in the default
hierarchy, we need to add some new field into the cpuset structure as
well as a new tmpmasks structure that is used to pre-allocate cpumasks
at the top level cpuset functions to avoid memory allocation in inner
functions as memory allocation failure in those inner functions may
cause a cpuset to have inconsistent states.
