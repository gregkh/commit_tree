powerpc/pkeys: Fix handling of pkey state across fork()

Protection key tracking information is not copied over to the
mm_struct of the child during fork(). This can cause the child to
erroneously allocate keys that were already allocated. Any allocated
execute-only key is lost aswell.

Add code; called by dup_mmap(), to copy the pkey state from parent to
child explicitly.

This problem was originally found by Dave Hansen on x86, which turns
out to be a problem on powerpc aswell.
