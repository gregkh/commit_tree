clk: imx6q: reset exclusive gates on init

The exclusive gates may be set up in the wrong way by software running
before the clock driver comes up. In that case the exclusive setup is
locked in its initial state, as the complementary function can't be
activated without disabling the initial setup first.

To avoid this lock situation, reset the exclusive gates to the off
state and allow the kernel to provide the proper setup.
