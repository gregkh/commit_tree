ice: Cleanup duplicate control queue code

1. Assigning the register offset and mask values contains duplicate code
   that can easily be replaced with a macro.

2. Separate functions for freeing send queue and receive queue rings are
   not needed; replace with a single function that uses a pointer to the
   struct ice_ctl_q_ring structure as a parameter instead of a pointer to
   the struct ice_ctl_q_info structure.

3. Initializing register settings for both send queue and receive queue
   contains duplicate code that can easily be replaced with a helper
   function.

4. Separate functions for freeing send queue and receive queue buffers are
   not needed; duplicate code can easily be replaced with a macro.
