leds: lp5523: fix a missing check of return value of lp55xx_read

When lp55xx_read() fails, "status" is an uninitialized variable and thus
may contain random value; using it leads to undefined behaviors.

The fix inserts a check for the return value of lp55xx_read: if it
fails, returns with its error code.
