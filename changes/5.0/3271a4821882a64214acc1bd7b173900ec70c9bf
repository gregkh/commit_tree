selftests: net: fix/improve ip_defrag selftest

Commit ade446403bfb ("net: ipv4: do not handle duplicate fragments as
overlapping") changed IPv4 defragmentation so that duplicate fragments,
as well as _some_ fragments completely covered by previously delivered
fragments, do not lead to the whole frag queue being discarded. This
makes the existing ip_defrag selftest flaky.

This patch
* makes sure that negative IPv4 defrag tests generate truly overlapping
  fragments that trigger defrag queue drops;
* tests that duplicate IPv4 fragments do not trigger defrag queue drops;
* makes a couple of minor tweaks to the test aimed at increasing its code
  coverage and reduce flakiness.
