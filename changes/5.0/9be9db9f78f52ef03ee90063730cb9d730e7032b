scsi: ufs: Fix geometry descriptor size

Albeit we no longer rely on those hard-coded descriptor sizes, we still use
them as our defaults, so better get it right. While adding its sysfs
entries, we forgot to update the geometry descriptor size. It is 0x48
according to UFS2.1, and wasn't changed in UFS3.0.
