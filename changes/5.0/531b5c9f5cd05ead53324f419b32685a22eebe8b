sched/topology: Make Energy Aware Scheduling depend on schedutil

Energy Aware Scheduling (EAS) is designed with the assumption that
frequencies of CPUs follow their utilization value. When using a CPUFreq
governor other than schedutil, the chances of this assumption being true
are small, if any. When schedutil is being used, EAS' predictions are at
least consistent with the frequency requests. Although those requests
have no guarantees to be honored by the hardware, they should at least
guide DVFS in the right direction and provide some hope in regards to the
EAS model being accurate.

To make sure EAS is only used in a sane configuration, create a strong
dependency on schedutil being used. Since having sugov compiled-in does
not provide that guarantee, make CPUFreq call a scheduler function on
governor changes hence letting it rebuild the scheduling domains, check
the governors of the online CPUs, and enable/disable EAS accordingly.
