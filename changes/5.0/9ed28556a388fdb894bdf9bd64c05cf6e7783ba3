net/smc: allow fallback after clc timeouts

If connection initialization fails for the LLC CONFIRM LINK or the
LLC ADD LINK step, fallback to TCP should be enabled. Thus
the negative return code -EAGAIN should switch to a positive timeout
reason code in these cases, and the internal CLC socket should
not have a set sk_err.
