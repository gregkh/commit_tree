powerpc/powernv: Move npu struct from pnv_phb to pci_controller

The powernv PCI code stores NPU data in the pnv_phb struct. The latter
is referenced by pci_controller::private_data. We are going to have NPU2
support in the pseries platform as well but it does not store any
private_data in in the pci_controller struct; and even if it did,
it would be a different data structure.

This makes npu a pointer and stores it one level higher in
the pci_controller struct.
