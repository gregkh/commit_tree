kvm: vmx: Don't set hardware IA32_CSTAR MSR on VM-entry

SYSCALL raises #UD in compatibility mode on Intel CPUs, so it's
pointless to load the guest's IA32_CSTAR value into the hardware MSR.

IA32_CSTAR still provides 48 bits of storage on Intel CPUs that have
CPUID.80000001:EDX.LM[bit 29] set, so we cannot remove it from the
vmx_msr_index[] array.
