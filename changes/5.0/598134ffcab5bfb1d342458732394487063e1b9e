Revert "serial: 8250: Default SERIAL_OF_PLATFORM to SERIAL_8250"

This reverts commit 6d11023c345e369bcb9d5a68b271764e362c1f6e.

It causes issues with Guenter's test systems and since there seems to
not be any agreement about _why_ this is a problem, but reverting it
fixes things, let's revert until the root cause is found.
