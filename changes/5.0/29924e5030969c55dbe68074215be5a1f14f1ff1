seq_buf: Use size_t for len in seq_buf_puts()

Jann Horn points out that we're using unsigned int for len in
seq_buf_puts(), which could potentially overflow if we're passed a
UINT_MAX sized string.

The rest of the code already uses size_t, so we should also use that
in seq_buf_puts() to avoid any issues.
