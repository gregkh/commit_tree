btrfs: add cleanup_ref_head_accounting helper

We were missing some quota cleanups in check_ref_cleanup, so break the
ref head accounting cleanup into a helper and call that from both
check_ref_cleanup and cleanup_ref_head.  This will hopefully ensure that
we don't screw up accounting in the future for other things that we add.
