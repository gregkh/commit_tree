net: socionext: different approach on DMA

Current driver dynamically allocates an skb and maps it as DMA Rx
buffer. In order to prepare for upcoming XDP changes, let's introduce a
different allocation scheme.
Buffers are allocated dynamically and mapped into hardware.
During the Rx operation the driver uses build_skb() to produce the
necessary buffers for the network stack.
This change increases performance ~15% on 64b packets with smmu disabled
and ~5% with smmu enabled
