perf cs-etm: Rename CS_ETM_TRACE_ON to CS_ETM_DISCONTINUITY

TRACE_ON element is used at the beginning of trace, it also can be
appeared in the middle of trace data to indicate discontinuity; for
example, it's possible to see multiple TRACE_ON elements in the trace
stream if the trace is being limited by address range filtering.

Furthermore, except TRACE_ON element is for discontinuity, NO_SYNC and
EO_TRACE also can be used to indicate discontinuity, though they are
used for different scenarios for which the trace is interrupted.

This patch renames sample type CS_ETM_TRACE_ON to CS_ETM_DISCONTINUITY,
firstly the new name describes more closely the purpose of the packet;
secondly this is a preparation for other output elements which also
cause the trace discontinuity thus they can share the same one packet
type.
