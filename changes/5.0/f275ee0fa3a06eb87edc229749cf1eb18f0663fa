IN_BADCLASS: fix macro to actually work

Commit 65cab850f0ee ("net: Allow class-e address assignment via ifconfig
ioctl") modified the IN_BADCLASS macro a bit, but unfortunatly one too
many '(' characters were added to the line, making any code that used
it, not build properly.

Also, the macro now compares an unsigned with a signed value, which
isn't ok, so fix that up by making both types match properly.
