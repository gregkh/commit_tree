ARM: OMAP: dts: N950/N9: fix onenand timings

Commit a758f50f10cf ("mtd: onenand: omap2: Configure driver from DT")
started using DT specified timings for GPMC, and as a result the
OneNAND stopped working on N950/N9 as we had wrong values in the DT.
Fix by updating the values to bootloader timings that have been tested
to be working on both Nokia N950 and N9.
