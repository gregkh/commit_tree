fgraph: Create a fgraph.c file to store function graph infrastructure

As the function graph infrastructure can be used by thing other than
tracing, moving the code to its own file out of the trace_functions_graph.c
code makes more sense.

The fgraph.c file will only contain the infrastructure required to hook into
functions and their return code.
