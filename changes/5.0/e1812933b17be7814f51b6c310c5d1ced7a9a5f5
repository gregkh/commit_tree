x86/selftests/pkeys: Fork() to check for state being preserved

There was a bug where the per-mm pkey state was not being preserved across
fork() in the child.  fork() is performed in the pkey selftests, but all of
the pkey activity is performed in the parent.  The child does not perform
any actions sensitive to pkey state.

To make the test more sensitive to these kinds of bugs, add a fork() where
the parent exits, and execution continues in the child.

To achieve this let the key exhaustion test not terminate at the first
allocation failure and fork after 2*NR_PKEYS loops and continue in the
child.
