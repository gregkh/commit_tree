spi: bcm2835: Drop unused code for native Chip Select

Commit a30a555d7435 ("spi: bcm2835: transform native-cs to gpio-cs on
first spi_setup") disabled the use of hardware-controlled native Chip
Select in favour of software-controlled GPIO Chip Select but left code
to support the former untouched.  Remove it to simplify the driver and
ease the addition of new features and further optimizations.
