riscv, atomic: Add #define's for the atomic_{cmp,}xchg_*() variants

If an architecture does not define the atomic_{cmp,}xchg_*() variants,
the generic implementation defaults them to the fully-ordered version.

riscv's had its own variants since "the beginning", but it never told
(#define-d these for) the generic implementation: it is time to do so.
