crypto: skcipher - remove remnants of internal IV generators

Remove dead code related to internal IV generators, which are no longer
used since they've been replaced with the "seqiv" and "echainiv"
templates.  The removed code includes:

- The "givcipher" (GIVCIPHER) algorithm type.  No algorithms are
  registered with this type anymore, so it's unneeded.

- The "const char *geniv" member of aead_alg, ablkcipher_alg, and
  blkcipher_alg.  A few algorithms still set this, but it isn't used
  anymore except to show via /proc/crypto and CRYPTO_MSG_GETALG.
  Just hardcode "<default>" or "<none>" in those cases.

- The 'skcipher_givcrypt_request' structure, which is never used.
