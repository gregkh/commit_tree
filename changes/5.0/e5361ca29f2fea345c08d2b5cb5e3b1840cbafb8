ACPI / scan: Refactor _CCA enforcement

Rather than checking the DMA attribute at each callsite, just pass it
through for acpi_dma_configure() to handle directly. That can then deal
with the relatively exceptional DEV_DMA_NOT_SUPPORTED case by explicitly
installing dummy DMA ops instead of just skipping setup entirely. This
will then free up the dev->dma_ops == NULL case for some valuable
fastpath optimisations.
