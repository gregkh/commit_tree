block: return just one value from part_in_flight

The previous patches deleted all the code that needed the second value
returned from part_in_flight - now the kernel only uses the first value.

Consequently, part_in_flight (and blk_mq_in_flight) may be changed so that
it only returns one value.

This patch just refactors the code, there's no functional change.
