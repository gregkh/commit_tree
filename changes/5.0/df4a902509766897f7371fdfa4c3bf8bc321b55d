netfilter: nf_conncount: merge lookup and add functions

'lookup' is always followed by 'add'.
Merge both and make the list-walk part of nf_conncount_add().

This also avoids one unneeded unlock/re-lock pair.

Extra care needs to be taken in count_tree, as we only hold rcu
read lock, i.e. we can only insert to an existing tree node after
acquiring its lock and making sure it has a nonzero count.

As a zero count should be rare, just fall back to insert_tree()
(which acquires tree lock).

This issue and its solution were pointed out by Shawn Bohrer
during patch review.
