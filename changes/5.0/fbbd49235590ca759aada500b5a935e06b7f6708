scsi: target/core: Simplify the code for aborting SCSI commands

Instead of allowing the code that aborts a SCSI command to finish before
all iSCSI data frames have been received, make that code wait until all
iSCSI data frames have been received. Introduce a new member variable in
the target driver template to communicate that information from the iSCSI
target driver to the target core. This change allows to leave out the check
whether or not it is already safe to send the TASK_ABORTED reply from
transport_send_task_abort().
