doc: Clarify RCU data-structure comment about rcu_tree fanout

RCU Data-Structures document describes a trick to test RCU with small
number of CPUs but with a taller tree. It wasn't immediately clear how
the document arrived at 16 CPUs which also requires setting the
FANOUT_LEAF to 2 instead of the default of 16.  This commit therefore
provides the needed clarification.
