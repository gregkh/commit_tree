kyber: use sbitmap add_wait_queue/list_del wait helpers

sbq_wake_ptr() checks sbq->ws_active to know if it needs to loop
the wait indexes or not. This requires the use of the sbitmap
waitqueue wrappers, but kyber doesn't use those for its domain
token waitqueue handling.

Convert kyber to use the helpers. This fixes a hang with waiting
for domain tokens.
