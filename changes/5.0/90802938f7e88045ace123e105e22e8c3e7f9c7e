x86/cache: Rename config option to CONFIG_X86_RESCTRL

CONFIG_RESCTRL is too generic. The final goal is to have a generic
option called like this which is selected by the arch-specific ones
CONFIG_X86_RESCTRL and CONFIG_ARM64_RESCTRL. The generic one will
cover the resctrl filesystem and other generic and shared bits of
functionality.
