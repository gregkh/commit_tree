net/mlx5e: Annul encap action ordering requirement

Currently a FW syndrome is emitted if the driver configures a
multi-destination FTE where the first destination is a tunneled uplink
port and the second destination is a local vPort.

Support this scenario by creating a multi-destination FTE using the
firmware's extended destination capabilities.
