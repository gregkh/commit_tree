net: documentation: build a directory structure for drivers

Documentation/networking/ is full of cryptically named files with
driver documentation.  This makes finding interesting information
at a glance really hard.  Move all those files into a directory
called device_drivers (since not all drivers are for device) and
fix up references.

RFC v0.1 -> RFC v1:
 - also add .txt suffix to the files which are missing it (Quentin)
