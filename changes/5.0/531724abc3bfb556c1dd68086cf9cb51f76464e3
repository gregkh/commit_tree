block: avoid extra bio reference for async O_DIRECT

The bio referencing has a trick that doesn't do any actual atomic
inc/dec on the reference count until we have to elevator to > 1. For the
async IO O_DIRECT case, we can't use the simple DIO variants, so we use
__blkdev_direct_IO(). It always grabs an extra reference to the bio
after allocation, which means we then enter the slower path of actually
having to do atomic_inc/dec on the count.

We don't need to do that for the async case, unless we end up going
multi-bio, in which case we're already doing huge amounts of IO. For the
smaller IO case (< BIO_MAX_PAGES), we can do without the extra ref.

Based on an earlier patch (and commit log) from Jens Axboe.
