bpf: libbpf: Fix bpf_program__next() API

This patch restores the behavior in
commit eac7d84519a3 ("tools: libbpf: don't return '.text' as a program for multi-function programs")
such that bpf_program__next() does not return pseudo programs in ".text".

Fixes: 0c19a9fbc9cd ("libbpf: cleanup after partial failure in bpf_object__pin")
