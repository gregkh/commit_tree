MIPS: traps: Never enable FPU when CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n

When CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n we don't support floating point, so we'll
never need to enable the FPU. Avoid doing so on a Co-Processor Unusable
exception (do_cpu), and remove the Floating Point Exception handler
(do_fpe) which should never be executed when the FPU is disabled.
