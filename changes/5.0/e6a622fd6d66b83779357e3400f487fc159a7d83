nvmet: support fabrics sq flow control

Technical proposal 8005 "fabrics SQ flow control" introduces a mode
where a host and controller agree to omit sq_head pointer updates
when sending nvme completions.

In case the host indicated desire to operate in this mode (connect attribute)
the controller will return back a connect completion with sq_head value
of 0xffff as indication that it will omit sq_head pointer updates.

This mode saves us an atomic update in the I/O path.
