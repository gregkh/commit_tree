batman-adv: enable MCAST by default at compile time

Thanks to rigorous testing in wireless community mesh networks several
issues with multicast entries in the translation table were found and
fixed in the last 1.5 years. Now we see the first larger networks
(a few hundred nodes) with a batman-adv version with multicast
optimizations enabled arising, with no TT / multicast optimization
related issues so far.

Therefore it seems safe to enable multicast optimizations by default.
