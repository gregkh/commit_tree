Bluetooth: hci_h5: Turn off RTL8723BS on suspend, reprobe on resume

On many devices the RTL8723BS device gets reset during suspend/resume,
causing it to lose its firmware and all state.

Testing has shown it drops back to communicating at 115200 bps and sends
sync-request packages, indicating it has been fully reset.

This commit fixes this by queueing a reprobe on resume.

This mirrors how USB RTL BT devices, which have the same problem, are
handled in the btusb driver, there we set the USB_QUIRK_RESET_RESUME for
all RTL devices, which also causes a reprobe on resume. The only difference
is that here we need to do the reprobe ourselves.

Since we are doing a full reprobe on resume now, we can also turn off the
device on suspend to save power while suspended.
