mm: check nr_initialised with PAGES_PER_SECTION directly in defer_init()

When DEFERRED_STRUCT_PAGE_INIT is configured, only the first section of
each node's highest zone is initialized before defer stage.

static_init_pgcnt is used to store the number of pages like this:

    pgdat->static_init_pgcnt = min_t(unsigned long, PAGES_PER_SECTION,
                                              pgdat->node_spanned_pages);

because we don't want to overflow zone's range.

But this is not necessary, since defer_init() is called like this:

  memmap_init_zone()
    for pfn in [start_pfn, end_pfn)
      defer_init(pfn, end_pfn)

In case (pgdat->node_spanned_pages < PAGES_PER_SECTION), the loop would
stop before calling defer_init().

BTW, comparing PAGES_PER_SECTION with node_spanned_pages is not correct,
since nr_initialised is zone based instead of node based.  Even
node_spanned_pages is bigger than PAGES_PER_SECTION, its highest zone
would have pages less than PAGES_PER_SECTION.
