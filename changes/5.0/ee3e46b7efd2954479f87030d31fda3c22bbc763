kbuild: refactor modversions build rules

Let $(CC) compile objects into normal files *.o instead of .tmp_*.o
whether CONFIG_MODVERSIONS is enabled or not. With this, the input
file for objtool is always *.o so objtool_o can go away.

I guess the reason of using .tmp_*.o for intermediate objects was
to avoid leaving incomplete *.o file (, whose timestamp says it is
up-to-date) when the genksyms tool failed for some reasons.

It no longer matters because any targets are deleted on errors since
commit 9c2af1c7377a ("kbuild: add .DELETE_ON_ERROR special target").
