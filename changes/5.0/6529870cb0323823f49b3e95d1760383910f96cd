powerpc/perf: Update perf_regs structure to include MMCRA

On each sample, Monitor Mode Control Register A (MMCRA) content is
saved in pt_regs. MMCRA does not have a entry as-is in the pt_regs but
instead, MMCRA content is saved in the "dsisr" register of pt_regs.

Patch adds another entry to the perf_regs structure to include the
"MMCRA" printing which internally maps to the "dsisr" of pt_regs.

It also check for the MMCRA availability in the platform and present
value accordingly

mpe: This was the 2nd patch in a series with commit 333804dc3b7a
("powerpc/perf: Update perf_regs structure to include SIER") but I
accidentally only merged the 1st patch, so merge this one now.
