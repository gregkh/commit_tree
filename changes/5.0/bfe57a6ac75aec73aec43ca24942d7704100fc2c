ath10k: snoc: relax voltage requirements

I rarely see drivers specify precise voltage requirements like this, but
if we really have to...let's at least give a little wiggle room. Board
designs (and accompanying device trees) may not provide exactly the
voltage listed here, and we shouldn't fail to probe just because of
this.

Round these ranges down to the nearest volt, and provide a 0.05V margin.
The regulator should provide its own supported ranges, which will
helpfully intersect with these ranges.

I would just as well remove these ranges entirely, but if I understand
correctly, there's some reason that QCOM SoC's like to set zero /
non-zero voltages.
