crypto: aesni - Add scatter/gather avx stubs, and use them in C

Add the appropriate scatter/gather stubs to the avx asm.
In the C code, we can now always use crypt_by_sg, since both
sse and asm code now support scatter/gather.

Introduce a new struct, aesni_gcm_tfm, that is initialized on
startup to point to either the SSE, AVX, or AVX2 versions of the
four necessary encryption/decryption routines.

GENX_OPTSIZE is still checked at the start of crypt_by_sg.  The
total size of the data is checked, since the additional overhead
is in the init function, calculating additional HashKeys.
