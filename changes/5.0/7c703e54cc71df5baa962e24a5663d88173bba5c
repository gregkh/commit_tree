arch: switch the default on ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN

These days architectures are mostly out of the business of dealing with
struct scatterlist at all, unless they have architecture specific iommu
drivers.  Replace the ARCH_HAS_SG_CHAIN symbol with a ARCH_NO_SG_CHAIN
one only enabled for architectures with horrible legacy iommu drivers
like alpha and parisc, and conditionally for arm which wants to keep it
disable for legacy platforms.
