arm64: ftrace: always pass instrumented pc in x0

The core ftrace hooks take the instrumented PC in x0, but for some
reason arm64's prepare_ftrace_return() takes this in x1.

For consistency, let's flip the argument order and always pass the
instrumented PC in x0.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
