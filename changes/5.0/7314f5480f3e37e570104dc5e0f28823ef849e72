netrom: fix locking in nr_find_socket()

nr_find_socket(), nr_find_peer() and nr_find_listener() lock the
sock after finding it in the global list. However, the call path
requires BH disabled for the sock lock consistently.

Actually the locking is unnecessary at this point, we can just hold
the sock refcnt to make sure it is not gone after we unlock the global
list, and lock it later only when needed.
