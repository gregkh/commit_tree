scsi: megaraid_sas: Fix msleep granularity

In megasas_transition_to_ready() driver waits 180seconds for controller to
change FW state. Here we are calling msleep(1) in a loop for this.  As
explained in timers-howto.txt, msleep(1) will actually sleep longer than
1ms. If a faulty controller is connected, we will end up waiting for much
more than 180 seconds causing unnecessary delays during load.

Change the granularity of msleep() call from 1ms to 1000ms.
