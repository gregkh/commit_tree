selinux: use separate table for initial SID lookup

This moves handling of initial SIDs into a separate table. Note that the
SIDs stored in the main table are now shifted by SECINITSID_NUM and
converted to/from the actual SIDs transparently by helper functions.

This change doesn't make much sense on its own, but it simplifies
further sidtab overhaul in a succeeding patch.
