rcutorture: Make initrd/init execute in userspace

Currently, the initrd/init script and executable remain blocked almost
all the time.  However, it is necessary to test nohz_full userspace
execution, which both variants of initrd/init fail to do.  This commit
therefore causes initrd/init to spend about a millisecond per second
executing in userspace.
