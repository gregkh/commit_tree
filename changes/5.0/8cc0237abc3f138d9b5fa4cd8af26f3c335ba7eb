btrfs: Remove extent_page_data argument from writepage_delalloc

The only remaining use of the 'epd' argument in writepage_delalloc is
to reference the extent_io_tree which was set in extent_writepages. Since
it is guaranteed that page->mapping of any page passed to
writepage_delalloc (and __extent_writepage as the sole caller) to be
equal to that passed in extent_writepages we can directly get the
io_tree via the already passed inode (which is also taken from
page->mapping->host). No functional changes.
