arm64: dts: meson-axg: fix dtc warning about unit address

section 2.2.1 of the DT specs says: " If the node has no reg property,
the @unit-address must be omitted and the node-name alone differentiates
the node from other nodes at the same level in the tree"

Simply replace the '@' with a '-' to fix this warning.
