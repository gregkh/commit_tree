fs/locks: use properly initialized file_lock when unlocking.

Both locks_remove_posix() and locks_remove_flock() use a
struct file_lock without calling locks_init_lock() on it.
This means the various list_heads are not initialized, which
will become a problem with a later patch.

So change them both to initialize properly.  For flock locks,
this involves using flock_make_lock(), and changing it to
allow a file_lock to be passed in, so memory allocation isn't
always needed.
