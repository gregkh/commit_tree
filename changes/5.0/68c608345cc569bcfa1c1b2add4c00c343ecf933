swiotlb: remove dma_mark_clean

Instead of providing a special dma_mark_clean hook just for ia64, switch
ia64 to use the normal arch_sync_dma_for_cpu hooks instead.

This means that we now also set the PG_arch_1 bit for pages in the
swiotlb buffer, which isn't stricly needed as we will never execute code
out of the swiotlb buffer, but otherwise harmless.
