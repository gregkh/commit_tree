rtc: m41t80: Correct alarm month range with RTC reads

Add the missing adjustment of the month range on alarm reads from the
RTC, correcting an issue coming from commit 9c6dfed92c3e ("rtc: m41t80:
add alarm functionality").  The range is 1-12 for hardware and 0-11 for
`struct rtc_time', and is already correctly handled on alarm writes to
the RTC.

It was correct up until commit 48e9766726eb ("drivers/rtc/rtc-m41t80.c:
remove disabled alarm functionality") too, which removed the previous
implementation of alarm support.
