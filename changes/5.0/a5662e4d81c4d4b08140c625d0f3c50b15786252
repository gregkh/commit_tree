seccomp: switch system call argument type to void *

The const qualifier causes problems for any code that wants to write to the
third argument of the seccomp syscall, as we will do in a future patch in
this series.

The third argument to the seccomp syscall is documented as void *, so
rather than just dropping the const, let's switch everything to use void *
as well.

I believe this is safe because of 1. the documentation above, 2. there's no
real type information exported about syscalls anywhere besides the man
pages.
