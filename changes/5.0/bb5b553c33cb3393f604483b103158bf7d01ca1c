cpuset: Use descriptive text when reading/writing cpuset.sched.partition

Currently, cpuset.sched.partition returns the values, 0, 1 or -1 on
read. A person who is not familiar with the partition code may not
understand what they mean.

In order to make cpuset.sched.partition more user-friendly, it will
now display the following descriptive text on read:

  "root" - A partition root (top cpuset of a partition)
  "member" - A non-root member of a partition
  "root invalid" - An invalid partition root

Note that there is at least one partition in the whole cgroup hierarchy.
The top cpuset is the root of that partition.  The rests are either a
root if it starts a new partition or a member of a partition.

The cpuset.sched.partition file will now also accept "root" and
"member" besides 1 and 0 as valid input values. The "root invalid"
value is internal only and cannot be written to the file.
