drm/vgem: create a render node for vgem

VGEM doesn't do anything modeset specific, so in a way exposing a
primary node is 'wrong'. At the same time, we extensively use if for
creating dumb buffers, fences, prime fd <> handle imports/exports.

To the point that we explicitly annotate the vgem fence ioctls as
DRM_RENDER_ALLOW and have an IGT test which opens the render node.

close(drm_open_driver_render(DRIVER_VGEM))

Better late than never, let's flip the switch.
