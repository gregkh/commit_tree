arm64/sve: Disentangle <uapi/asm/ptrace.h> from <uapi/asm/sigcontext.h>

Currently, <uapi/asm/sigcontext.h> provides common definitions for
describing SVE context structures that are also used by the ptrace
definitions in <uapi/asm/ptrace.h>.

For this reason, a #include of <asm/sigcontext.h> was added in
ptrace.h, but it this turns out that this can interact badly with
userspace code that tries to include ptrace.h on top of the libc
headers (which may provide their own shadow definitions for
sigcontext.h).

To make the headers easier for userspace to consume, this patch
bounces the common definitions into an __SVE_* namespace and moves
them to a backend header <uapi/asm/sve_context.h> that can be
included by the other headers as appropriate.  This should allow
ptrace.h to be used alongside libc's sigcontext.h (if any) without
ill effects.

This should make the situation unambiguous: <asm/sigcontext.h> is
the header to include for the sigframe-specific definitions, while
<asm/ptrace.h> is the header to include for ptrace-specific
definitions.

To avoid conflicting with existing usage, <asm/sigcontext.h>
remains the canonical way to get the common definitions for
SVE_VQ_MIN, sve_vq_from_vl() etc., both in userspace and in the
kernel: relying on these being defined as a side effect of
including just <asm/ptrace.h> was never intended to be safe.
