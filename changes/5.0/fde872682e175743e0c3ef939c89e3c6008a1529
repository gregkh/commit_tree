ext4: force inode writes when nfsd calls commit_metadata()

Some time back, nfsd switched from calling vfs_fsync() to using a new
commit_metadata() hook in export_operations().  If the file system did
not provide a commit_metadata() hook, it fell back to using
sync_inode_metadata().  Unfortunately doesn't work on all file
systems.  In particular, it doesn't work on ext4 due to how the inode
gets journalled --- the VFS writeback code will not always call
ext4_write_inode().

So we need to provide our own ext4_nfs_commit_metdata() method which
calls ext4_write_inode() directly.
