dmaengine: sprd: Support DMA 2-stage transfer mode

The Spreadtrum DMA controller supports channel 2-stage tansfer mode,
that means we can request 2 dma channels, one for source channel, and
another one for destination channel. Once the source channel's transaction
is done, it will trigger the destination channel's transaction automatically
by hardware signal.
