ARM: dts: armada-xp: fix Armada XP boards NAND description

Commit 3b79919946cd2cf4dac47842afc9a893acec4ed7 ("ARM: dts:
armada-370-xp: update NAND node with new bindings") updated some
Marvell Armada DT description to use the new NAND controller bindings,
but did it incorrectly for a number of boards: armada-xp-gp,
armada-xp-db and armada-xp-lenovo-ix4-300d. Due to this, the NAND is
no longer detected on those platforms.

This commit fixes that by properly using the new NAND DT binding. This
commit was runtime-tested on Armada XP GP, the two other platforms are
only compile-tested.
