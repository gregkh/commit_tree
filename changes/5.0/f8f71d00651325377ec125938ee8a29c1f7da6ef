nfsd4: forbid all renames during grace period

The idea here was that renaming a file on a nosubtreecheck export would
make lookups of the old filehandle return STALE, making it impossible
for clients to reclaim opens.

But during the grace period I think we should also hold off on
operations that would break delegations.
