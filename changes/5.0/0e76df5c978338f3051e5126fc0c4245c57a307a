iio: dac: ad5686: fix bit shift read register

This patch solves the register readback issue with the bit shift. When the
dac resolution was lower than the register size (ex. 12 bits out of 16
bits) the readback value was not shifted with the difference in bits and
the value was higher. Also a mask is applied on the read value in order to
get the value relative to the actual bit size.
