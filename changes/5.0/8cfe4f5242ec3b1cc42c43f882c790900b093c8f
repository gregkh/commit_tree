powerpc/8xx: Move SW perf counters in first 32kb of memory

In order to simplify time critical exceptions handling 8xx
specific SW perf counters, this patch moves the counters into
the beginning of memory. This is possible because .text is readable
and the counters are never modified outside of the handlers.

By doing this, we avoid having to set a second register with
the upper part of the address of the counters.
