bpf, lpm: fix lookup bug in map_delete_elem

trie_delete_elem() was deleting an entry even though it was not matching
if the prefixlen was correct. This patch adds a check on matchlen.

Reproducer:

$ sudo bpftool map create /sys/fs/bpf/mylpm type lpm_trie key 8 value 1 entries 128 name mylpm flags 1
$ sudo bpftool map update pinned /sys/fs/bpf/mylpm key hex 10 00 00 00 aa bb cc dd value hex 01
$ sudo bpftool map dump pinned /sys/fs/bpf/mylpm
key: 10 00 00 00 aa bb cc dd  value: 01
Found 1 element
$ sudo bpftool map delete pinned /sys/fs/bpf/mylpm key hex 10 00 00 00 ff ff ff ff
$ echo $?
0
$ sudo bpftool map dump pinned /sys/fs/bpf/mylpm
Found 0 elements

A similar reproducer is added in the selftests.

Without the patch:

$ sudo ./tools/testing/selftests/bpf/test_lpm_map
test_lpm_map: test_lpm_map.c:485: test_lpm_delete: Assertion `bpf_map_delete_elem(map_fd, key) == -1 && errno == ENOENT' failed.
Aborted

With the patch: test_lpm_map runs without errors.
