powerpc/mm: add exec protection on powerpc 603

The 603 doesn't have a HASH table, TLB misses are handled by
software. It is then possible to generate page fault when
_PAGE_EXEC is not set like in nohash/32.

There is one "reserved" PTE bit available, this patch uses
it for _PAGE_EXEC.

In order to support it, set_pte_filter() and
set_access_flags_filter() are made common, and the handling
is made dependent on MMU_FTR_HPTE_TABLE
