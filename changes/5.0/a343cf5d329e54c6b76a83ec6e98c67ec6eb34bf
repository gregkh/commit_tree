staging: wilc1000: avoid extra buffer copy while connect cfg ops

Refactor the code to avoid the use of an extra buffer to store the
connection related parameter. No need to call cfg80211_disconnected in
case of failure to send the wid command to firmware, an error status is
directly returned in cfg80211 connect callback.
