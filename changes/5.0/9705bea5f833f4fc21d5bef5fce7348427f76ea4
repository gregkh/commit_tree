mm: convert zone->managed_pages to atomic variable

totalram_pages, zone->managed_pages and totalhigh_pages updates are
protected by managed_page_count_lock, but readers never care about it.
Convert these variables to atomic to avoid readers potentially seeing a
store tear.

This patch converts zone->managed_pages.  Subsequent patches will convert
totalram_panges, totalhigh_pages and eventually managed_page_count_lock
will be removed.

Main motivation was that managed_page_count_lock handling was complicating
things.  It was discussed in length here,
https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/995739/#1181785 So it seemes
better to remove the lock and convert variables to atomic, with preventing
poteintial store-to-read tearing as a bonus.
