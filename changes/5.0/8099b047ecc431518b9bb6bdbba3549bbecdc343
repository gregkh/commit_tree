exec: load_script: don't blindly truncate shebang string

load_script() simply truncates bprm->buf and this is very wrong if the
length of shebang string exceeds BINPRM_BUF_SIZE-2.  This can silently
truncate i_arg or (worse) we can execute the wrong binary if buf[2:126]
happens to be the valid executable path.

Change load_script() to return ENOEXEC if it can't find '\n' or zero in
bprm->buf.  Note that '\0' can come from either
prepare_binprm()->memset() or from kernel_read(), we do not care.
