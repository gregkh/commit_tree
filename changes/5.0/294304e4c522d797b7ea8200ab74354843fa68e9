netfilter: conntrack: udp: set stream timeout to 2 minutes

We have no explicit signal when a UDP stream has terminated, peers just
stop sending.

For suspected stream connections a timeout of two minutes is sane to keep
NAT mapping alive a while longer.

It matches tcp conntracks 'timewait' default timeout value.
