media: cec-pin: fix broken tx_ignore_nack_until_eom error injection

If the tx_ignore_nack_until_eom error injection was activated,
then tx_nacked was never set instead of setting it when the last
byte of the message was transmitted.

As a result the transmit was marked as OK, when it should have
been NACKed.

Modify the condition so that it always sets tx_nacked when the
last byte of the message was transmitted.
