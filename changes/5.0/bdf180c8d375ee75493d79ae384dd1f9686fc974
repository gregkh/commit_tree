iwlwifi: mvm: change PHY data RX for HE radiotap

The firmware changed the PHY data API, so follow suit.
Some data is now available even for HT/VHT frames, so
the info type in the metadata was changed. This change
isn't backwards compatible, but
 1) the firmware with the old API was never released;
 2) the only overlap in the info type field is from the
    old type of TB to the new of HT, so this basically
    just means that with older FW and newer driver the
    data will be considered missing.

While at it, remove the extra code to set the LTF syms
corresponding to the streams and use the data from the
device instead - we don't really need this in any case
other than when we have it from the device.

As the new API gives use the spatial reuse 1-4 fields
for trigger-based PPDUs, also expose that to radiotap.
