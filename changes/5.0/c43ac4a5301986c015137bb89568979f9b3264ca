tracing: Do not line wrap short line in function_graph_enter()

Commit 588ca1786f2dd ("function_graph: Use new curr_ret_depth to manage
depth instead of curr_ret_stack") removed a parameter from the call
ftrace_push_return_trace() that made it so that the entire call was under 80
characters, but it did not remove the line break. There's no reason to break
that line up, so make it a single line.
