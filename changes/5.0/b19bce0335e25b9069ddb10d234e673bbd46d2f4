net: ethernet: mediatek: fix warning in phy_start_aneg

linux 5.0-rc1 shows following warning on bpi-r2/mt7623 bootup:

maybe other boards using this generic driver are affected

v2:
optimization:

- phy_set_max_speed() is only needed if you want to reduce the
  max speed, typically if the PHY supports 1Gbps but the MAC
  supports 100Mbps only.

- The pause parameters are autonegotiated. Except you have a specific
  need you normally don't need to manually fiddle with this.

- phy_start_aneg() is called implicitly by the phylib state machine,
  you shouldn't call it manually except you have a good excuse.

- netif_carrier_on/netif_carrier_off in mtk_phy_link_adjust() isn't
  needed. It's done by phy_link_change() in phylib.
