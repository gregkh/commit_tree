drm/i915: Pull scheduling under standalone lock

Currently, the backend scheduling code abuses struct_mutex into order to
have a global lock to manipulate a temporary list (without widespread
allocation) and to protect against list modifications. This is an
extraneous coupling to struct_mutex and further can not extend beyond
the local device.

Pull all the code that needs to be under the one true lock into
i915_scheduler.c, and make it so.
