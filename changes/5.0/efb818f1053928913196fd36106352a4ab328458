drm/i915: Kill WA 0528

First of all I believe this WA as written here was wrong.

Because it is listed on BSpec only for SKL and BXT, exactly
the only 2 platforms skipped here.

But also it is written there that we don't need this WA
anymore:
"This workaround is no longer needed since NV12 support is
dropped for the affected projects in #0870."

SO, let's kill it.
