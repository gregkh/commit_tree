crypto: poly1305 - use structures for key and accumulator

In preparation for exposing a low-level Poly1305 API which implements
the ε-almost-∆-universal (εA∆U) hash function underlying the Poly1305
MAC and supports block-aligned inputs only, create structures
poly1305_key and poly1305_state which hold the limbs of the Poly1305
"r" key and accumulator, respectively.

These structures could actually have the same type (e.g. poly1305_val),
but different types are preferable, to prevent misuse.
