kernel/hung_task.c: break RCU locks based on jiffies

check_hung_uninterruptible_tasks() is currently calling rcu_lock_break()
for every 1024 threads.  But check_hung_task() is very slow if printk()
was called, and is very fast otherwise.

If many threads within some 1024 threads called printk(), the RCU grace
period might be extended enough to trigger RCU stall warnings.
Therefore, calling rcu_lock_break() for every some fixed jiffies will be
safer.
