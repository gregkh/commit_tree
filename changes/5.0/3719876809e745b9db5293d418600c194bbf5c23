sbitmap: Protect swap_lock from softirqs

The swap_lock used by sbitmap has a chain with locks taken from softirq,
but the swap_lock is not protected from being preempted by softirqs.

A chain exists of:

 sbq->ws[i].wait -> dispatch_wait_lock -> swap_lock

Where the sbq->ws[i].wait lock can be taken from softirq context, which
means all locks below it in the chain must also be protected from
softirqs.
