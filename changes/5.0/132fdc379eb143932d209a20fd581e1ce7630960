arm64: Do not issue IPIs for user executable ptes

Commit 3b8c9f1cdfc5 ("arm64: IPI each CPU after invalidating the I-cache
for kernel mappings") was aimed at fixing the I-cache invalidation for
kernel mappings. However, it inadvertently caused all cache maintenance
for user mappings via set_pte_at() -> __sync_icache_dcache() ->
sync_icache_aliases() to call kick_all_cpus_sync().
