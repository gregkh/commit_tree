ASoC: ti: Merge davinci and omap directories

Create new directory to contain all Texas Instruments specific DAI,
platform and machine drivers instead of scattering them under davinci and
omap directories.

There is already inter dependency between the two directories becasue of
McASP (on dra7x it is serviced by sDMA, not EDMA).

With the upcoming AM654 we will need to introduce new platform driver for
UDMA and it does not fit under davinci, nor under omap.

With the move I have restructured the Kconfig to be more usable in the era
of simple-sound-card:
CPU DAIs can be selected individually and they will select the platform
driver they can be served with.

To avoid breakage, I have moved over deprecated Kconfig options so
defconfig builds will work without regression.
