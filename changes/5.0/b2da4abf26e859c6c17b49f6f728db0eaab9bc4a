scsi: target: consistently null-terminate t10_wwn strings

In preparation for supporting user provided vendor strings, add an extra
byte to the vendor, model and revision arrays in struct t10_wwn. This
ensures that the full INQUIRY data can be carried in the arrays along with
a null-terminator.

Change a number of array readers and writers so that they account for
explicit null-termination:

- The pscsi_set_inquiry_info() and emulate_model_alias_store() codepaths
  don't currently explicitly null-terminate; fix this.

- Existing t10_wwn field dumps use for-loops which step over
  null-terminators for right-padding.
  + Use printf with width specifiers instead.
