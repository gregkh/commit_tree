autofs: drop dentry reference only when it is never used

autofs_expire_run() calls dput(dentry) to drop the reference count of
dentry.  However, dentry is read via autofs_dentry_ino(dentry) after
that.  This may result in a use-free-bug.  The patch drops the reference
count of dentry only when it is never used.
