blk-mq: allow software queue to map to multiple hardware queues

The mapping used to be dependent on just the CPU location, but
now it's a tuple of (type, cpu) instead. This is a prep patch
for allowing a single software queue to map to multiple hardware
queues. No functional changes in this patch.

This changes the software queue count to an unsigned short
to save a bit of space. We can still support 64K-1 CPUs,
which should be enough. Add a check to catch a wrap.
