bpf: fix a compilation error when CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL is not defined

Kernel test robot (lkp@intel.com) reports a compilation error at
  https://www.spinics.net/lists/netdev/msg534913.html
introduced by commit 838e96904ff3 ("bpf: Introduce bpf_func_info").

If CONFIG_BPF is defined and CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL is not defined,
the following error will appear:
  kernel/bpf/core.c:414: undefined reference to `btf_type_by_id'
  kernel/bpf/core.c:415: undefined reference to `btf_name_by_offset'

When CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL is not defined,
let us define stub inline functions for btf_type_by_id()
and btf_name_by_offset() in include/linux/btf.h.
This way, the compilation failure can be avoided.
