cpufreq: check if policy is inactive early in __cpufreq_get()

cpuinfo_cur_freq gets current CPU frequency as detected by hardware
while scaling_cur_freq last known CPU frequency. Some platforms may not
allow checking the CPU frequency of an offline CPU or the associated
resources may have been released via cpufreq_exit when the CPU gets
offlined, in which case the policy would have been invalidated already.
If we attempt to get current frequency from the hardware, it may result
in hang or crash.

For example on Juno, I see:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000188
[0000000000000188] pgd=0000000000000000

So fix the issue by checking if the policy is invalid early in
__cpufreq_get before attempting to get the current frequency.
