ata: pata_acpi: Make PCI dependency explicit

After commit 5d32a66541c4 (PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without
CONFIG_PCI set) dependencies on CONFIG_PCI that previously were
satisfied implicitly through dependencies on CONFIG_ACPI have to be
specified directly. PATA_ACPI is a PCI device driver but the PCI
dependency has not been explicitly called out.
