clk: vc5: Add suspend/resume support

Add simple suspend/resume handlers to the driver to restore the chip
configuration after resume. It is possible that the chip was configured
with non-default values before suspend-resume cycle and that the chip
is powered down during this cycle, so the configuration could get lost.
