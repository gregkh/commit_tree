staging: vchiq_core: remove unnecessary safety checks in vchiq_init_state

vchiq_init_state() checks the initial contents of slot_zero are correct.
These are set in vchiq_init_slots(), using the same hard-coded defaults
as the checks. Both functions are called sequentially and Video Core
isn't yet aware of the slot's address. There is no way the contents of
slot_zero changed in between functions, making the checks useless.
