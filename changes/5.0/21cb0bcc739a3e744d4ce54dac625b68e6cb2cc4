scsi: zfcp: group sort internal structure definitions for proximity

Have structures just before the structures that use them (without
disrupting sequences of using structures such as zfcp_unit and
zfcp_scsi_dev):

 - zfcp_adapter_mempool embedded in zfcp_adapter,

 - zfcp_latenc... embedded in zfcp_scsi_dev.
