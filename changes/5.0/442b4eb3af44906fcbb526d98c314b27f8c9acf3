perf annotate: Pass filename to objdump via execl

The symbol__disassemble() function uses shell to launch objdump and
filter its output via grep. Passing filenames by interpolating them into
the command line via "%s" may lead to problems if said filenames contain
special characters.

Instead, pass the filename as a command line argument where it is not
subject to any kind of interpretation, then use quoted shell
interpolation to build the strings we need safely.
