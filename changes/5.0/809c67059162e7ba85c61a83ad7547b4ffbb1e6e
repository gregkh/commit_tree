test_rhashtable: remove semaphore usage

This is one of only two files that initialize a semaphore to a negative
value. We don't really need the two semaphores here at all, but can do
the same thing in more conventional and more effient way, by using a
single waitqueue and an atomic thread counter.

This gets us a little bit closer to eliminating classic semaphores from
the kernel. It also fixes a corner case where we fail to continue after
one of the threads fails to start up.

An alternative would be to use a split kthread_create()+wake_up_process()
and completely eliminate the separate synchronization.
