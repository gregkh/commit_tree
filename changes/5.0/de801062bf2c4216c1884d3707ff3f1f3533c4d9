drm/amd/display: Freesync does not engage on some displays

[Why]
Current render margin time is not sufficient to compute exit frame
time for most monitors.

[How]
Declared  render margin in FPS to compute a exit frame rate that is
4 FPS above the minimum FPS required to engage FreeSync.
 Also did code clean-up to remove redundancies.
