kvm: sev: Fail KVM_SEV_INIT if already initialized

By code inspection, it was found that multiple calls to KVM_SEV_INIT
could deplete asid bits and overwrite kvm_sev_info's regions_list.

Multiple calls to KVM_SVM_INIT is not likely to occur with QEMU, but this
should likely be fixed anyway.

This code is serialized by kvm->lock.
