mlxsw: reg: Add Policy Engine Algorithmic Bloom Filter Entries Register

Bloom filter is a bit vector which allows the HW a fast lookup on a
small size bit vector, that may reduce the number of lookups on the
A-TCAM memory. PEABFE register allows setting values to the bits of
the bit vector mentioned above.
Add the register to be later used in A-TCAM optimizations.
