kernfs: Improve kernfs_notify() poll notification latency

kernfs_notify() does two notifications: poll and fsnotify. Originally,
both notifications were done from scheduled work context and all that
kernfs_notify() did was schedule the work.

This patch simply moves the poll notification from the scheduled work
handler to kernfs_notify(). The fsnotify notification still needs to be
done from scheduled work context because it can sleep (it needs to lock
a mutex).

If the poll notification is time critical (the notified thread needs to
wake as quickly as possible), it's better to do it from kernfs_notify()
directly. One example is calling sysfs_notify_dirent() from a hardware
interrupt handler to wake up a thread and handle the interrupt in user
space.
