media: cx23885: only reset DMA on problematic CPUs

It is reported that commit 95f408bbc4e4 ("media: cx23885: Ryzen DMA
related RiSC engine stall fixes") caused regresssions with other CPUs.

Ensure that the quirk will be applied only for the CPUs that
are known to cause problems.

A module option is added for explicit control of the behaviour.
