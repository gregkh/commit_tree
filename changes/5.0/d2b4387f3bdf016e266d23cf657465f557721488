media: platform: Add Aspeed Video Engine driver

The Video Engine (VE) embedded in the Aspeed AST2400 and AST2500 SOCs
can capture and compress video data from digital or analog sources. With
the Aspeed chip acting a service processor, the Video Engine can capture
the host processor graphics output.

Add a V4L2 driver to capture video data and compress it to JPEG images.
Make the video frames available through the V4L2 streaming interface.
