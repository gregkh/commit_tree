ioremap: rework pXd_free_pYd_page() API

The recently merged API for ensuring break-before-make on page-table
entries when installing huge mappings in the vmalloc/ioremap region is
fairly counter-intuitive, resulting in the arch freeing functions (e.g.
pmd_free_pte_page()) being called even on entries that aren't present.
This resulted in a minor bug in the arm64 implementation, giving rise to
spurious VM_WARN messages.

This patch moves the pXd_present() checks out into the core code,
refactoring the callsites at the same time so that we avoid the complex
conjunctions when determining whether or not we can put down a huge
mapping.
