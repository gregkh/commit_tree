tcp: take care of compressed acks in tcp_add_reno_sack()

Neal pointed out that non sack flows might suffer from ACK compression
added in the following patch ("tcp: implement coalescing on backlog queue")

Instead of tweaking tcp_add_backlog() we can take into
account how many ACK were coalesced, this information
will be available in skb_shinfo(skb)->gso_segs
