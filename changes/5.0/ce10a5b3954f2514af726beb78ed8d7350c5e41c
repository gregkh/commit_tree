timekeeping: Use proper seqcount initializer

tk_core.seq is initialized open coded, but that misses to initialize the
lockdep map when lockdep is enabled. Lockdep splats involving tk_core seq
consequently lack a name and are hard to read.

Use the proper initializer which takes care of the lockdep map
initialization.
