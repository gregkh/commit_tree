blkcg: remove additional reference to the css

The previous patch in this series removed carrying around a pointer to
the css in blkg. However, the blkg association logic still relied on
taking a reference on the css to ensure we wouldn't fail in getting a
reference for the blkg.

Here the implicit dependency on the css is removed. The association
continues to rely on the tryget logic walking up the blkg tree. This
streamlines the three ways that association can happen: normal, swap,
and writeback.
