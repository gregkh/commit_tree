drm/i915: Reserve some priority bits for internal use

In the next few patches, we will want to give a small priority boost to
some requests/queues but not so much that we perturb the user controlled
order. As such we will shift the user priority bits higher leaving
ourselves a few low priority bits for our internal bumping.
