arm64: function_graph: Remove use of FTRACE_NOTRACE_DEPTH

Functions in the set_graph_notrace no longer subtract FTRACE_NOTRACE_DEPTH
from curr_ret_stack, as that is now implemented via the trace_recursion
flags. Access to curr_ret_stack no longer needs to worry about checking for
this. curr_ret_stack is still initialized to -1, when there's not a shadow
stack allocated.
