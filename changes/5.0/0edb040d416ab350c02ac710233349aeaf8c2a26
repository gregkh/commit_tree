regulator: core: Track dangling GPIO descriptors

If a GPIO descriptor is passed to the regulator_register()
function inside the config->ena_gpiod callers must be
sure that once they call this API the regulator core
owns that descriptor and will make sure to issue
gpiod_put() on it, no matter whether the call is
successful or not.

For device tree regulators, the regulator core will
automatically set up regulator init data from the device
tree when registering a regulator by calling
regulator_of_get_init_data() which in turn calls down to
the regulator driver's .of_parse_cb() callback.
This callback (in drivers such as for max77686) may also
choose to fill in the config->ena_gpiod field with a GPIO
descriptor.

Harden the errorpath of regulator_register() to
properly gpiod_put() any passed in cfg->ena_gpiod
or any gpiod coming from the device tree on any type
of error.
