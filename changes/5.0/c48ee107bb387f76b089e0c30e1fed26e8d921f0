perf augmented_raw_syscalls: Copy 'access' arg as well

This will all come from userspace, but to test the changes to make 'perf
trace' output similar to strace's, do this one more now manually.

To update the precompiled augmented_raw_syscalls.o binary I just run:

  # perf record -e ~acme/git/perf/tools/perf/examples/bpf/augmented_raw_syscalls.c sleep 1
  LLVM: dumping /home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf/examples/bpf/augmented_raw_syscalls.o
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.022 MB perf.data ]
  #

Because to have augmented_raw_syscalls to be always used and a fast
startup and remove the need to have the llvm toolchain installed, I'm
using:

  # perf config | grep add_events
  trace.add_events=/home/acme/git/perf/tools/perf/examples/bpf/augmented_raw_syscalls.o
  #

So when doing changes to augmented_raw_syscals.c one needs to rebuild
the .o file.

This will be done automagically later, i.e. have a 'make' behaviour of
recompiling when the .c gets changed.
