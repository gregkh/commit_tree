powerpc/dts/fsl: Fix dtc-flagged interrupt errors

mpc8641_hpcn was updated to 4-cell interrupt specifiers, but
PCI interrupt-map was not updated.  It was also missing #interrupt-cells
on the outer PCI buses.

p1020rdb-pc was updated to 4-cell interrupt specifiers, but
the ethernet-phy nodes weren't updated.

mpc832x_rdb had an invalid "interrupts = <0>" on the ethernet-phy nodes.
Besides being the wrong number of cells, 0 is not a valid IPIC interrupt
according to ipic.c.  Presumably it was meant to indicate that these
PHYs are not connected to an interrupt.
