ARM: dts: meson8b: add the ARM TWD timer

The Meson8B SoC is using four ARM Cortex-A5 cores which come with a
"TWD" (Timer-Watchdog) based timer. This adds support for the ARM TWD
Timer on this SoC.

[ rebased patch from Carlo, use IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING instead of
  IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW to prevent "GIC: PPI13 is secure or misconfigured"
  message during boot, use pre-processor macros to specify the IRQ,
  added the correct clock, dropped TWD watchdog node since there's no
  driver for it anymore ]
