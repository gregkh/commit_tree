qede: Simplify the usage of qede-flags.

The values represented by qede->flags is being used in mixed ways:
  1. As 'value' at some places e.g., QEDE_FLAGS_IS_VF usage
  2. As bit-mask(value) at some places e.g., QEDE_FLAGS_PTP_TX_IN_PRORGESS
     usage.
This implementation pose problems in future when we want to add more flag
values e.g., overlap of the values, overflow of 64-bit storage.

Updated the implementation to go with approach (2) for qede->flags.
