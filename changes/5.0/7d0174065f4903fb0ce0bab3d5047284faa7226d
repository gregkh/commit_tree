binderfs: use __u32 for device numbers

We allow more then 255 binderfs binder devices to be created since there
are workloads that require more than that. If we use __u8 we'll overflow
after 255. So let's use a __u32.
Note that there's no released kernel with binderfs out there so this is
not a regression.
