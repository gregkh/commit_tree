drm/bridge: tc358767: fix initial DP0/1_SRCCTRL value

Initially DP0_SRCCTRL is set to a static value which includes
DP0_SRCCTRL_LANES_2 and DP0_SRCCTRL_BW27, even when only 1 lane of
1.62Gbps speed is used. DP1_SRCCTRL is configured to a magic number.

This patch changes the configuration as follows:

Configure DP0_SRCCTRL by using tc_srcctrl() which provides the correct
value.

DP1_SRCCTRL needs two bits to be set to the same value as DP0_SRCCTRL:
SSCG and BW27. All other bits can be zero.
