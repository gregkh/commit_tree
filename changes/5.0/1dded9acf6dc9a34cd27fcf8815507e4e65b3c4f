loop: Avoid circular locking dependency between loop_ctl_mutex and bd_mutex

Code in loop_change_fd() drops reference to the old file (and also the
new file in a failure case) under loop_ctl_mutex. Similarly to a
situation in loop_set_fd() this can create a circular locking dependency
if this was the last reference holding the file open. Delay dropping of
the file reference until we have released loop_ctl_mutex.
