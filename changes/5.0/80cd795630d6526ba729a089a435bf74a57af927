binder: fix use-after-free due to ksys_close() during fdget()

44d8047f1d8 ("binder: use standard functions to allocate fds")
exposed a pre-existing issue in the binder driver.

fdget() is used in ksys_ioctl() as a performance optimization.
One of the rules associated with fdget() is that ksys_close() must
not be called between the fdget() and the fdput(). There is a case
where this requirement is not met in the binder driver which results
in the reference count dropping to 0 when the device is still in
use. This can result in use-after-free or other issues.

If userpace has passed a file-descriptor for the binder driver using
a BINDER_TYPE_FDA object, then kys_close() is called on it when
handling a binder_ioctl(BC_FREE_BUFFER) command. This violates
the assumptions for using fdget().

The problem is fixed by deferring the close using task_work_add(). A
new variant of __close_fd() was created that returns a struct file
with a reference. The fput() is deferred instead of using ksys_close().
