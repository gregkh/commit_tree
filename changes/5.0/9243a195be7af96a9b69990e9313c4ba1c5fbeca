regulator: core: Change voltage setting path

On Odroid XU3/4 and other Exynos5422 based boards there is a case, that
different devices on the board are supplied by different regulators
with non-fixed voltages. If one of these devices temporarily requires
higher voltage, there might occur a situation that the spread between
two devices' voltages is so high, that there is a risk of changing
'high' and 'low' states on the interconnection between devices powered
by those regulators.

Uncoupled regulators should be a special case of coupled regulators, so
they should share a common voltage setting path. When enabling,
disabling or setting voltage of a coupled regulator, all coupled
regulators should be locked. Regulator's supplies should be locked, when
setting voltage of a single regulator. Enabling a coupled regulator or
setting its voltage should not be possible if some of its coupled
regulators, has not been registered.

Add function for locking coupled regulators and supplies. Extract
a new function regulator_set_voltage_rdev() from
regulator_set_voltage_unlocked(), which is called when setting
voltage of a single regulator.
