um: Add support for DISCARD in the UBD Driver

Support for DISCARD and WRITE_ZEROES in the ubd driver using
fallocate.

DISCARD is enabled by default and can be disabled using a new
UBD command line flag.

If the underlying fs on which the UBD image is stored does not
support DISCARD the support for both DISCARD and WRITE_ZEROES
is turned off.
