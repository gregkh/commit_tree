drm: Fix up drm_atomic_state_helper.[hc] extraction

I've misplaced two functions by accident:
- drm_atomic_helper_duplicate_state is really part of the
  resume/suspend/shutdown device-wide helpers.
- drm_atomic_helper_legacy_gamma_set is part of the legacy ioctl
  compat helpers.

Move them both back.
