mtd: keep original flags for every struct mtd_info

When allocating a new partition mtd subsystem runs internal tests in the
allocate_partition(). They may result in modifying specified flags (e.g.
dropping some /features/ like write access).

Those constraints don't have to be necessary true for subpartitions. It
may happen parent partition isn't block aligned (effectively disabling
write access) while subpartition may fit blocks nicely. In such case all
checks should be run again (starting with original flags value).
