net: hns3: update coalesce param per second

coalesce param updates every 100 napi times, it may update a little
late if ping test after a high rate flow, may over napi poll is called
100 times as ping test sends packets every second.

This patch updates coalesce param every second, instead with every
100 napi times. It can not update the param 100% in time, but the
lag time is very short.
