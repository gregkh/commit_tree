scsi: lpfc: Fix LOGO/PLOGI handling when triggerd by ABTS Timeout event

After a LOGO in response to an ABTS timeout, a PLOGI wasn't issued to
re-establish the login.  An nlp_type check in the LOGO completion
handler failed to restart discovery for NVME targets.  Revised the
nlp_type check for NVME as well as SCSI.

While reviewing the LOGO handling a few other issues were seen and
were addressed:

- Better lock synchronization around ndlp data types

- When the ABTS times out, unregister the RPI before sending the LOGO
  so that all local exchange contexts are cleared and nothing received
  while awaiting LOGO/PLOGI handling will be accepted.

- LOGO handling optimized to:
   Wait only R_A_TOV for a response.
   It doesn't need to be retried on timeout. If there wasn't a
     response, a PLOGI will be sent, thus an implicit logout
     applies as well when the other port sees it.
   If there is a response, any kind of response is considered "good"
     and the XRI quarantined for a exchange qualifier window.

- PLOGI is issued as soon a LOGO state is resolved.
