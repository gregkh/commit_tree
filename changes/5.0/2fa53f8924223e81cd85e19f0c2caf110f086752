bpf, doc: add reviewers to maintainers entry

In order to better scale BPF development on netdev, we've adopted a
reviewer rotation for all BPF patches among the five of us for some
time now. Lets give credit where credit is due, and add Martin, Song
and Yonghong as official BPF reviewers to MAINTAINERS file. Also
while at it, add regex matching for BPF such that we get properly
Cc'ed for files not listed here.
