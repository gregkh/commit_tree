ALSA: firewire-tascam: queue events for change of control surface

Units of TASCAM FireWire series transfer image of states of the unit in
tx isochronous packets. Demultiplexing of the states from the packets
is done in software interrupt context regardless of any process context.
In a view of userspace applications, it needs to have notification
mechanism to catch change of the states.

This commit implements a queue to store events for the notification. The
image of states includes fluctuating data such as level of gain/volume
for physical input/output and position of knobs. Therefore the events
are queued corresponding to some control features only.

Furthermore, the queued events are planned to be consumed by userspace
applications via ALSA hwdep interface. This commit suppresses event
queueing when no applications open the hwdep interface.

However, the queue is maintained in an optimistic scenario, thus without
any care against overrrun. This is reasonable because target events are
useless just to handle PCM frames. It starts queueing when an usespace
application opens hwdep interface, thus it's expected to read the queued
events steadily.
