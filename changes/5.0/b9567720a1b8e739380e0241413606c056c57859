arm64: mm: Allow forcing all userspace addresses to 52-bit

On arm64 52-bit VAs are provided to userspace when a hint is supplied to
mmap. This helps maintain compatibility with software that expects at
most 48-bit VAs to be returned.

In order to help identify software that has 48-bit VA assumptions, this
patch allows one to compile a kernel where 52-bit VAs are returned by
default on HW that supports it.

This feature is intended to be for development systems only.
