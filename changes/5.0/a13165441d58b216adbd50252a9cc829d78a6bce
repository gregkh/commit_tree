loop: Push lo_ctl_mutex down into individual ioctls

Push acquisition of lo_ctl_mutex down into individual ioctl handling
branches. This is a preparatory step for pushing the lock down into
individual ioctl handling functions so that they can release the lock as
they need it. We also factor out some simple ioctl handlers that will
not need any special handling to reduce unnecessary code duplication.
