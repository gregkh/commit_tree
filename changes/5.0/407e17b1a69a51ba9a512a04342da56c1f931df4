net/mlx5e: XDP, fix redirect resources availability check

Currently mlx5 driver creates xdp redirect hw queues unconditionally on
netdevice open, This is great until someone starts redirecting XDP traffic
via ndo_xdp_xmit on mlx5 device and changes the device configuration at
the same time, this might cause crashes, since the other device's napi
is not aware of the mlx5 state change (resources un-availability).

To fix this we must synchronize with other devices napi's on the system.
Added a new flag under mlx5e_priv to determine XDP TX resources are
available, set/clear it up when necessary and use synchronize_rcu()
when the flag is turned off, so other napi's are in-sync with it, before
we actually cleanup the hw resources.

The flag is tested prior to committing to transmit on mlx5e_xdp_xmit, and
it is sufficient to determine if it safe to transmit or not. The other
two internal flags (MLX5E_STATE_OPENED and MLX5E_SQ_STATE_ENABLED) become
unnecessary. Thus, they are removed from data path.
