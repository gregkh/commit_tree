brcmfmac: fix roamoff=1 modparam

When the update_connect_param callback is set, nl80211 expects the flag
WIPHY_FLAG_SUPPORTS_FW_ROAM to be set as well. However, this flag is
only set when modparam roamoff=0, while the callback is set
unconditionally. Since commit 7f9a3e150ec7 this causes a warning in
wiphy_register, which breaks brcmfmac.

Disable the update_connect_param callback when roamoff=0 to fix this.
