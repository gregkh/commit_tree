datagram: introduce skb_copy_and_hash_datagram_iter helper

Introduce a helper to copy datagram into an iovec iterator
but also update a predefined hash. This is useful for
consumers of skb_copy_datagram_iter to also support inflight
data digest without having to finish to copy and only then
traverse the iovec and calculate the digest hash.
