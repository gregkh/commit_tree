vhost_net: mitigate page reference counting during page frag refill

We do a get_page() which involves a atomic operation. This patch tries
to mitigate a per packet atomic operation by maintaining a reference
bias which is initially USHRT_MAX. Each time a page is got, instead of
calling get_page() we decrease the bias and when we find it's time to
use a new page we will decrease the bias at one time through
__page_cache_drain_cache().

Testpmd(virtio_user + vhost_net) + XDP_DROP on TAP shows about 1.6%
improvement.
