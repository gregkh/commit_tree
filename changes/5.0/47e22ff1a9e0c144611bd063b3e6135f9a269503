drm: Add connector property to limit max bpc

At times 12bpc HDMI cannot be driven due to faulty cables, dongles
level shifters etc. To workaround them we may need to drive the output
at a lower bpc. Currently the user space does not have a way to limit
the bpc. The default bpc to be programmed is decided by the driver and
is run against connector limitations.

Creating a new connector property "max bpc" in order to limit the bpc.
xrandr can make use of this connector property to make sure that bpc does
not exceed the configured value. This property can be used by userspace to
set the bpc.

V2: Initialize max_bpc to satisfy kms_properties
V3: Move the property to drm_connector
V4: Split drm and i915 components(Ville)
V5: Make the property per connector(Ville)
V6: Compare the requested bpc to connector bpc(Daniel)
    Move the attach_property function to core(Ville)
V7: Fix checkpatch warnings
V8: Simplify the connector check code(Ville)
V9: Const display_info(Ville)
V10,V11: Fix CI issues.
V12: Add the Kernel documentation(Daniel)
V14: Crossreference the function name in the doc(Daniel)
