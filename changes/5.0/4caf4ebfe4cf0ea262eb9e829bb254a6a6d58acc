Fix access_ok() fallout for sparc32 and powerpc

These two architectures actually had an intentional use of the 'type'
argument to access_ok() just to avoid warnings.

I had actually noticed the powerpc one, but forgot to then fix it up.
And I missed the sparc32 case entirely.

This is hopefully all of it.
