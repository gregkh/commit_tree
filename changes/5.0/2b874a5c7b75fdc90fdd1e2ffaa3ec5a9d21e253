powerpc/configs: Don't enable PPC_EARLY_DEBUG in defconfigs

This reverts the remains of commit b9ef7d6b11c1 ("powerpc: Update
default configurations").

That commit was proceeded by a commit which added a config option to
control use of BOOTX for early debug, ie. PPC_EARLY_DEBUG_BOOTX, and
then the update of the defconfigs was intended to not change behaviour
by then enabling the new config option.

However enabling PPC_EARLY_DEBUG had other consequences, notably
causing us to register the udbg console at the end of udbg_early_init().

This means on a system which doesn't have anything that BOOTX can
use (most systems), we register the udbg console very early but the
bootx code just throws everything away, meaning early boot messages
are never printed to the console.

What we want to happen is for the udbg console to only be registered
later (from setup_arch()) once we've setup udbg_putc, and then all
early boot messages will be replayed.
