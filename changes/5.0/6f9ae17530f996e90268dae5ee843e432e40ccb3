igb: Change RXPBSIZE size when setting Qav mode

Section 4.5.9 of the datasheet says that the total size of all packet
buffers combined (TxPB 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + RxPB + BMC2OS + OS2BMC) must not
exceed 60KB. Today we are configuring a total of 62KB, so reduce the
RxPB from 32KB to 30KB in order to respect that.

The choice of changing RxPBSIZE here is mainly because it seems more
correct to give more priority to the transmit packet buffers over the
receiver ones when running in Qav mode. Also, the BMC2OS and OS2BMC
sizes are already too short.
