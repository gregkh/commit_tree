libceph: handle an empty authorize reply

The authorize reply can be empty, for example when the ticket used to
build the authorizer is too old and TAG_BADAUTHORIZER is returned from
the service.  Calling ->verify_authorizer_reply() results in an attempt
to decrypt and validate (somewhat) random data in au->buf (most likely
the signature block from calc_signature()), which fails and ends up in
con_fault_finish() with !con->auth_retry.  The ticket isn't invalidated
and the connection is retried again and again until a new ticket is
obtained from the monitor:

  libceph: osd2 192.168.122.1:6809 bad authorize reply
  libceph: osd2 192.168.122.1:6809 bad authorize reply
  libceph: osd2 192.168.122.1:6809 bad authorize reply
  libceph: osd2 192.168.122.1:6809 bad authorize reply

Let TAG_BADAUTHORIZER handler kick in and increment con->auth_retry.
