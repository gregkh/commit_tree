btrfs: cleanup extent_op handling

The cleanup_extent_op function actually would run the extent_op if it
needed running, which made the name sort of a misnomer.  Change it to
run_and_cleanup_extent_op, and move the actual cleanup work to
cleanup_extent_op so it can be used by check_ref_cleanup() in order to
unify the extent op handling.
