can: flexcan: split the Message Buffer RAM area

The message buffer RAM area is not a contiguous 1KB area but 2 partitions
of 512 bytes each. Till now, we used Message buffers with payload size 8
bytes, which translates to 32 MBs per partition and no spare space is left
in any partition.
However, in upcoming SOC LX2160A the message buffers can have payload size
64 bytes. This results in less than 32 MBs per partition and some empty
area is left at the end of each partition.This empty area should not be
accessed.
Therefore, split the Message Buffer RAM area into two partitions.
