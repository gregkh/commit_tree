tracing: Use var_refs[] for hist trigger reference checking

Since all the variable reference hist_fields are collected into
hist_data->var_refs[] array, there's no need to go through all the
fields looking for them, or in separate arrays like synth_var_refs[],
which will be going away soon anyway.

This also allows us to get rid of some unnecessary code and functions
currently used for the same purpose.
