net: tls: Fix deadlock in free_resources tx

If there are outstanding async tx requests (when crypto returns EINPROGRESS),
there is a potential deadlock: the tx work acquires the lock, while we
cancel_delayed_work_sync() while holding the lock.  Drop the lock while waiting
for the work to complete.
