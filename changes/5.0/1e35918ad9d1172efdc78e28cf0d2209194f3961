MIPS: Enable Undefined Behavior Sanitizer UBSAN

Select ARCH_HAS_UBSAN_SANITIZE_ALL in order to allow the user to
enable CONFIG_UBSAN_SANITIZE_ALL and instrument the entire kernel for
ubsan checks.
We exclude the VDSO from this because its build doesn't include the
__ubsan_handle_*() functions that the kernel proper defines in from
lib/ubsan.c, and the VDSO would have no sane way to report errors even
if it had definitions of these functions.
