xen-netback: don't populate the hash cache on XenBus disconnect

Occasionally, during the disconnection procedure on XenBus which
includes hash cache deinitialization there might be some packets
still in-flight on other processors. Handling of these packets includes
hashing and hash cache population that finally results in hash cache
data structure corruption.

In order to avoid this we prevent hashing of those packets if there
are no queues initialized. In that case RCU protection of queues guards
the hash cache as well.
