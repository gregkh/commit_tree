drm/vc4: Set ->is_yuv to false when num_planes == 1

When vc4_plane_state is duplicated ->is_yuv is left assigned to its
previous value, and we never set it back to false when switching to
a non-YUV format.

Fix that by setting ->is_yuv to false in the 'num_planes == 1' branch
of the vc4_plane_setup_clipping_and_scaling() function.
