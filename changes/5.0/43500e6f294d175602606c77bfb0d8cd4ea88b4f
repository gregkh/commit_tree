x86/cpufeatures: Remove get_scattered_cpuid_leaf()

get_scattered_cpuid_leaf() was added[1] to help KVM rebuild hardware-
defined leafs that are rearranged by Linux to avoid bloating the
x86_capability array. Eventually, the last consumer of the function was
removed[2], but the function itself was kept, perhaps even intentionally
as a form of documentation.

Remove get_scattered_cpuid_leaf() as it is currently not used by KVM.
Furthermore, simply rebuilding the "real" leaf does not resolve all of
KVM's woes when it comes to exposing a scattered CPUID feature, i.e.
keeping the function as documentation may be counter-productive in some
scenarios, e.g. when KVM needs to do more than simply expose the leaf.
