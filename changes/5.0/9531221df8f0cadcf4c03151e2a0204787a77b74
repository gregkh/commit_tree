drm/i915: Check for panel orientation quirks on eDP panels

So far we have only been calling
drm_connector_init_panel_orientation_property(), which checks for
panel orientation quirks in the drm_panel_orientation_quirks.c file,
for DSI panels as so far only devices with DSI panels have had panels
which are not mounted up right.

The new GPD win2 device uses a portrait screen in a landscape case,
so now we've a device with an eDP panel which needs the panel-orientation
property to let the fbcon code and userspace know that the image needs to
be fixed-up.

This commit makes intel_edp_init_connector() call
drm_connector_init_panel_orientation_property() so that the property
gets added.
