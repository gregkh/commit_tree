RISC-V: Update Kconfig to better handle CMDLINE

Added a menu to choose how the built-in command line will be
used and CMDLINE_EXTEND for compatibility with FDT code.

v2: Improved help messages, removed references to bootloader
and made them more descriptive. I also asked help from a
friend who's a language expert just in case.

v3: This time used the corrected text

v4: Copy the config strings from the arm32 port.

v5: Actually copy the config strings from the arm32 port.
