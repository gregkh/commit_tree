fpga: mgr: altera-ps-spi: enable usage on non-dt platforms

Driver probing fails on non-dt platforms since of_match_device()
always returns NULL here. Add spi ids with device names and
matching driver data as an index of a map array with data for
supported devices. Add this map array and a function for mapping
spi ids to driver data. This allows driver binding to dynamically
added PS-SPI devices (e.g. when added via spi_new_device() after
hot-plugging).
