PM-runtime: Fix deadlock when canceling hrtimer

When rpm_resume() desactivates the autosuspend timer, it should only
try to cancel hrtimer but not wait for the handler to finish, because
both rpm_resume() and pm_suspend_timer_fn() take the power.lock.

A deadlock is possible as follows:

CPU0                              CPU1
rpm_resume()
  spin_lock_irqsave
                                  pm_suspend_timer_fn()
                                    spin_lock_irqsave
  pm_runtime_deactivate_timer()
    hrtimer_cancel()

It is sufficient to call hrtimer_try_to_cancel() from
pm_runtime_deactivate_timer(), because dev->power.timer_expires
reset to 0 by it, so use that function instead of hrtimer_cancel().
