module: make it clearer when we're handling kallsyms symbols vs exported symbols

The module loader internally works with both exported symbols
represented as struct kernel_symbol, as well as Elf symbols from a
module's symbol table. It's hard to distinguish sometimes which type of
symbol we're handling given that some helper function names are not
consistent or helpful. Take get_ksymbol() for instance - are we
looking for an exported symbol or a kallsyms symbol here? Or symname()
and kernel_symbol_name() - which function handles an exported symbol and
which one an Elf symbol?

Clean up and unify the function naming scheme a bit to make it clear
which kind of symbol we're handling. This change only affects static
functions internal to the module loader.
