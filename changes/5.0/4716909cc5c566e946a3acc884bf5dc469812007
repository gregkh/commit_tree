cpuset: Track cpusets that use parent's effective_cpus

In the default hierarchy, a cpuset will use the parent's effective_cpus
if none of the requested CPUs can be granted from the parent. That can
be a problem if a parent is a partition root with children partition
roots. Changes to a parent's effective_cpus list due to changes in a
child partition root may not be properly reflected in a child cpuset
that use parent's effective_cpus because the cpu_exclusive rule of a
partition root will not guard against that.

In order to avoid the mismatch, two new tracking variables are added to
the cpuset structure to track if a cpuset uses parent's effective_cpus
and the number of children cpusets that use its effective_cpus. So
whenever cpumask changes are made to a parent, it will also check to
see if it has other children cpusets that use its effective_cpus and
call update_cpumasks_hier() if that is the case.
