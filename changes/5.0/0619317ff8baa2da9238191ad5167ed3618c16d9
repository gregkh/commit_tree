block: add polled wakeup task helper

If we're polling for IO on a device that doesn't use interrupts, then
IO completion loop (and wake of task) is done by submitting task itself.
If that is the case, then we don't need to enter the wake_up_process()
function, we can simply mark ourselves as TASK_RUNNING.
