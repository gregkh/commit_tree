drm/bridge/synopsys: dsi: add ability to have glue-specific attach and detach

With the regular means of adding the dsi-component in probe it creates
a race condition with the panel probing, as the panel device only gets
created after the dsi-bus got created.

When the panel-driver is build as a module it currently fails hard as the
panel cannot be probed directly:

dw_mipi_dsi_bind()
  __dw_mipi_dsi_probe()
    creates dsi bus
    creates panel device
    triggers panel module load
    panel not probed (module not loaded or panel probe slow)
  drm_bridge_attach
    fails with -EINVAL due to empty panel_bridge

Additionally the panel probing can run concurrently with dsi bringup
making it possible that the panel can already be found but dsi-attach
hasn't finished running.

To solve that cleanly we may want to only create the component after
the panel has finished probing, by calling component_add from the
host-attach dsi callback.

As that is specific to glue drivers, add a new struct for host_ops
so that glue drivers can tell the bridge to call specific functions
after the common host-attach and before the common host-detach run.
