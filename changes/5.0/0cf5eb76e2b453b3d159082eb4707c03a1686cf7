drm/amd/display: Add tracing to dc

[Why]
Tracing is a useful and cheap debug functionality

[How]
This creates a new trace system amdgpu_dm, currently with
three trace events

amdgpu_dc_rreg and amdgpu_dc_wreg report the address and value
of any dc register reads and writes

amdgpu_dc_performance requires at least one of those two to be
enabled.  It counts the register reads and writes since the
last entry

v2: Don't check for NULL before kfree
