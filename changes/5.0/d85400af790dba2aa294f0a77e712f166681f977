ocfs2: clear journal dirty flag after shutdown journal

Dirty flag of the journal should be cleared at the last stage of umount,
if do it before jbd2_journal_destroy(), then some metadata in uncommitted
transaction could be lost due to io error, but as dirty flag of journal
was already cleared, we can't find that until run a full fsck.  This may
cause system panic or other corruption.
