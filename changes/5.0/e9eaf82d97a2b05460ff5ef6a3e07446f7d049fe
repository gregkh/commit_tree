drm/i915: Priority boost for waiting clients

Latency is in the eye of the beholder. In the case where a client stops
and waits for the gpu, give that request chain a small priority boost
(not so that it overtakes higher priority clients, to preserve the
external ordering) so that ideally the wait completes earlier.

v2: Tvrtko recommends to keep the boost-from-user-stall as small as
possible and to allow new client flows to be preferred for interactivity
over stalls.
