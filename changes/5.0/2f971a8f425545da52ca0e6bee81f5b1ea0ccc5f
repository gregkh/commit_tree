netfilter: nf_conncount: move all list iterations under spinlock

Two CPUs may race to remove a connection from the list, the existing
conn->dead will result in a use-after-free. Use the per-list spinlock to
protect list iterations.

As all accesses to the list now happen while holding the per-list lock,
we no longer need to delay free operations with rcu.

Joint work with Florian.
