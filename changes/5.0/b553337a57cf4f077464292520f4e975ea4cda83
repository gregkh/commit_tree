fat: remove FAT_FIRST_ENT macro

The comment edited in this patch was the only reference to the
FAT_FIRST_ENT macro, which is not used anymore.  Moreover, the commented
line of code does not compile with the current code.

Since the FAT_FIRST_ENT macro checks the FAT variant in a way that the
patch series changes, I removed it, and instead wrote a clear
explanation of what was checked.

I verified that the changed comment is correct according to Microsoft
FAT spec, search for "BPB_Media" in the following references:

1. Microsoft FAT specification 2005
(http://read.pudn.com/downloads77/ebook/294884/FAT32%20Spec%20%28SDA%20Contribution%29.pdf).
Search for 'volume label'.
2. Microsoft Extensible Firmware Initiative, FAT32 File System Specification
