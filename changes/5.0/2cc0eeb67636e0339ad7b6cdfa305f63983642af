sctp: define subscribe in sctp_sock as __u16

The member subscribe in sctp_sock is used to indicate to which of
the events it is subscribed, more like a group of flags. So it's
better to be defined as __u16 (2 bytpes), instead of struct
sctp_event_subscribe (13 bytes).

Note that sctp_event_subscribe is an UAPI struct, used on sockopt
calls, and thus it will not be removed. This patch only changes
the internal storage of the flags.
