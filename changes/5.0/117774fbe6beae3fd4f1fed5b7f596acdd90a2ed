pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a77990: Fix IOCTRL reg state after s2ram on R-Car E3

Due to an interaction with commit 9f2b76a2db3c4387 ("pinctrl: sh-pfc:
r8a77990: Add R8A774C0 PFC support"), the state of the I/O Control
Registers is saved/restored during s2ram on RZ/G2E, but not on R-Car E3.
Hence on R-Car E3, SDHI voltage state is lost after system resume.

Fix this by registering the I/O Control Registers on R-Car E3, too.
