Revert "usb: dwc3: pci: Use devm functions to get the phy GPIOs"

Commit 211f658b7b40 ("usb: dwc3: pci: Use devm functions to get
the phy GPIOs") changed the code to claim the PHY GPIOs permanently
for Intel Baytrail devices.

This causes issues when the actual PHY driver attempts to claim the
same GPIO descriptors. For example, tusb1210 now fails to probe with:

  tusb1210: probe of dwc3.0.auto.ulpi failed with error -16 (EBUSY)

dwc3-pci needs to turn on the PHY once before dwc3 is loaded, but
usually the PHY driver will then hold the GPIOs to turn off the
PHY when requested (e.g. during suspend).

To fix the problem, this reverts the commit to restore the old
behavior to put the GPIOs immediately after usage.
