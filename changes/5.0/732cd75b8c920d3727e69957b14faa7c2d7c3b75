sched/fair: Select an energy-efficient CPU on task wake-up

If an Energy Model (EM) is available and if the system isn't
overutilized, re-route waking tasks into an energy-aware placement
algorithm. The selection of an energy-efficient CPU for a task
is achieved by estimating the impact on system-level active energy
resulting from the placement of the task on the CPU with the highest
spare capacity in each performance domain. This strategy spreads tasks
in a performance domain and avoids overly aggressive task packing. The
best CPU energy-wise is then selected if it saves a large enough amount
of energy with respect to prev_cpu.

Although it has already shown significant benefits on some existing
targets, this approach cannot scale to platforms with numerous CPUs.
This is an attempt to do something useful as writing a fast heuristic
that performs reasonably well on a broad spectrum of architectures isn't
an easy task. As such, the scope of usability of the energy-aware
wake-up path is restricted to systems with the SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY flag
set, and where the EM isn't too complex.
