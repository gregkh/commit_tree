bnxt_en: Save ring statistics before reset.

With the current driver, the statistics reported by .ndo_get_stats64()
are reset when the device goes down.  Store a snapshot of the
rtnl_link_stats64 before shutdown.  This snapshot is added to the
current counters in .ndo_get_stats64() so that the counters will not
get reset when the device is down.
