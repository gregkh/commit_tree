bus: ti-sysc: Add mcasp optional clocks flag

We have OPT_CLKS_NEEDED in legacy platform data, but it's missing
from the ti-sysc driver for device tree based configuration.

In order to pass OPT_CLKS_NEEDED quirk flag we need to update omap4 module
data and add a new compatible for dra7 as the module layout is different
from sysc_regbits_omap4_mcasp.

target modules")
