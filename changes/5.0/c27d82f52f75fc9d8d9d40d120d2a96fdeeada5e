fs/drop_caches.c: avoid softlockups in drop_pagecache_sb()

When superblock has lots of inodes without any pagecache (like is the
case for /proc), drop_pagecache_sb() will iterate through all of them
without dropping sb->s_inode_list_lock which can lead to softlockups
(one of our customers hit this).

Fix the problem by going to the slow path and doing cond_resched() in
case the process needs rescheduling.
