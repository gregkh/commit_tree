staging: erofs: refine compressed pages preload flow

Currently, there are two kinds of compressed pages in erofs:
  1) file pages for the in-place decompression and
  2) managed pages for cached decompression.
Both are all stored in grp->compressed_pages[].

For managed pages, they could already exist or could be preloaded
in this round, including the following cases in detail:
  1) Already valid (loaded in some previous round);
  2) PAGE_UNALLOCATED, should be allocated at the time of submission;
  3) Just found in the managed cache, and with an extra page ref.
Currently, 1) and 3) can be distinguishable by lock_page and
checking its PG_private, which is guaranteed by the reclaim path,
but it's better to do a double check by using an extra tag.

This patch reworks the preload flow by introducing such the tag
by using tagged pointer, too many #ifdefs are removed as well.
