drm/i915: Fuse per-context workaround handling with the common framework

Convert the per context workaround handling code to run against the newly
introduced common workaround framework and fuse the two to use the
existing smarter list add helper, the one which does the sorted insert and
merges registers where possible.

This completes migration of all four classes of workarounds onto the
common framework.

Existing macros are kept untouched for smaller code churn.

v2:
 * Rename to list name ctx_wa_list and move from dev_priv to engine.

v3:
 * API rename and parameters tweaking. (Chris Wilson)
