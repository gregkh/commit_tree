octeontx2-af: Add MKEX default profile

Added basic default MKEX profile. This profile tells
hardware what data to extract from packet and where to
place it (bit offset) in final KEY generated for the
parsed packet. Based on the bit placement of the packet
data, MCAM entries have to programmed for matching.

Also added a msg to retrieve this MKEX profile from PF/VF
which inturn can process it to determine how MCAM entry
has to be populated.
