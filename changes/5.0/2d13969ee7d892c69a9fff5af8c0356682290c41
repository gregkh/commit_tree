serdev: document the write functions using kernel-doc

Document the asynchronous serdev_device_write_buf() and synchronous
serdev_device_write() functions using kernel-doc.

Specifically, mention that writing data only means that data has been
buffered by the controller, and that the synchronous helper depends on
serdev_device_write_wakeup() being called in the driver write_wakeup()
callback.
