net: dev: Issue NETDEV_PRE_CHANGEADDR

When a device address is about to be changed, or an address added to the
list of device HW addresses, it is necessary to ensure that all
interested parties can support the address. Therefore, send the
NETDEV_PRE_CHANGEADDR notification, and if anyone bails on it, do not
change the address.
