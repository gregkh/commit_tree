ixgbe: use mii_bus to handle MII related ioctls

Use the mii_bus callbacks to address the entire clause 22/45 address
space.  Enables userspace to poke switch registers instead of a single
PHY address.

The ixgbe firmware may be polling PHYs in a way that is not protected by
the mii_bus lock.  This isn't new behavior, but as Andrew Lunn pointed
out there are more addresses available for conflicts.
