tracing: Make function ‘ftrace_exports’ static

In commit 478409dd683d ("tracing: Add hook to function tracing for other
subsystems to use"), a new function ‘ftrace_exports’ was added. Since
this function can be made static, make it so.

Silence the following warning triggered using W=1:

  kernel/trace/trace.c:2451:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘ftrace_exports’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
