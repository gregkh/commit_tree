qed: Fix qed_chain_set_prod() for PBL chains with non power of 2 page count

In PBL chains with non power of 2 page count, the producer is not at the
beginning of the chain when index is 0 after a wrap. Therefore, after the
producer index wrap around, page index should be calculated more carefully.
