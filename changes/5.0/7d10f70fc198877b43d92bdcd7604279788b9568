fs: Don't need to put list_lru into its own cacheline

The list_lru structure is essentially just a pointer to a table of
per-node LRU lists.  Even if CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM is defined, the list
field is just used for LRU list registration and shrinker_id is set at
initialization.  Those fields won't need to be touched that often.

So there is no point to make the list_lru structures to sit in their own
cachelines.
