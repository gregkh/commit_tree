drm: Add helper to implement legacy dirtyfb

Add an atomic helper to implement dirtyfb support.  This is needed to
support DSI command-mode panels with x11 userspace (ie. when we can't
rely on pageflips to trigger a flush to the panel).

v2: Modified the helper to use plane fb_damage_clips property and
removed plane_state::dirty flag.

v3:
- Use uapi drm_mode_rect.
- Support annotate flags.

v4: Correct kernel doc.
