arm64: fix ARM64_USER_VA_BITS_52 builds

In some randconfig builds, the new CONFIG_ARM64_USER_VA_BITS_52
triggered a build failure:

arch/arm64/mm/proc.S:287: Error: immediate out of range

As it turns out, we were incorrectly setting PGTABLE_LEVELS here,
lacking any other default value.
This fixes the calculation of CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS to consider
all combinations again.
