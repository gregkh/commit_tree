arm64: hugetlb: Register hugepages during arch init

Add hstate for each supported hugepage size using arch initcall.

* no hugepage parameters

  Without hugepage parameters, only a default hugepage size is
  available for dynamic allocation.  It's different, for example, from
  x86_64 and sparc64 where all supported hugepage sizes are available.

* only default_hugepagesz= is specified and set not to HPAGE_SIZE

  In spite of the fact that default_hugepagesz= is set to a valid
  hugepage size, it's treated as unsupported and reverted to
  HPAGE_SIZE.  Such behaviour is also different from x86_64 and
  sparc64.
