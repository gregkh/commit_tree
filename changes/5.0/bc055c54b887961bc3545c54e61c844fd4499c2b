perf symbols: Relax checks on perf-PID.map ownership

Those are simple enough, and usually not produced by root, instead by
whatever user is running java, rust, Node.js JIT code that end up
generating those /tmp/perf-PID.map for resolution of symbols in the
anonymous executable maps.

Having to use --force to resolve symbols in 'perf top' is a distraction,
as recently I experienced when node.js symbols were not being resolved
by 'perf top'.
