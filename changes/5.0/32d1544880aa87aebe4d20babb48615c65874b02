ARM: pxa: Add gpio descriptor lookup tables for MMC CD/WP

This adds GPIO descriptor look-up tables for a whole bunch
of PXA boards with MMC card detect (CD) and write protect (WP)
GPIO lines, so we can move away from the hard-coded GPIO
numberspace.

In some cases the platforms were compulsively including the
<linux/gpio.h> header even if they weren't actually using
it, and in these cases I simply replaced that inclusion with
the more appropriate <linux/gpio/machine.h> which is what
board files should be including most of the time.
