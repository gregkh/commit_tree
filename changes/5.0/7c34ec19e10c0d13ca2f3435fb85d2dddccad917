net/mlx5: Make RoCE and SR-IOV LAG modes explicit

With the introduction of SR-IOV LAG, checking whether LAG is active
is no longer good enough, since RoCE and SR-IOV LAG each entails
different behavior by both the core and infiniband drivers.

This patch introduces facilities to discern LAG type, in addition to
mlx5_lag_is_active(). These are implemented in such a way as to allow
more complex mode combinations in the future.
