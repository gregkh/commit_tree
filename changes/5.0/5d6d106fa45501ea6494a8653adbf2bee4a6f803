OPP: Populate required opp tables from "required-opps" property

The current implementation works only for the case where a single
phandle is present in the "required-opps" property, while DT allows
multiple phandles to be present there.

This patch adds new infrastructure to parse all the phandles present in
"required-opps" property and save pointers of the required OPP's OPP
tables. These will be used by later commits.
