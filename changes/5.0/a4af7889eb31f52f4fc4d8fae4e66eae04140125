drm/i915: Fix threshold check in intel_hpd_irq_storm_detect()

Currently in intel_hpd_irq_storm_detect() when we detect that the last
recorded hotplug wasn't within the period defined by
HPD_STORM_DETECT_DELAY, we make the mistake of resetting the HPD count
to 0 without incrementing it. This results in us only enabling storm
detection when we go +2 above the threshold, e.g. an HPD threshold of 5
would not trigger a storm until we reach a total of 7 hotplugs.

So: rework the code a bit so we reset the HPD count when
HPD_STORM_DETECT_DELAY has passed, then increment the count afterwards.
Also, clean things up a bit to make it easier to undertand.
