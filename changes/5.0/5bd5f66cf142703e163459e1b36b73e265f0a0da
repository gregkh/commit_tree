scsi: lpfc: lpfc_sli: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases where
we are expecting to fall through.

Notice that, in this particular case, I replaced "Drop thru" and "Fall
Thru" with "fall through" annotations, which is what GCC is expecting to
find.

Also, in some cases a dash is added as a token in order to separate the
"fall through" annotation from the rest of the comment on the same line,
which is what GCC is expecting to find.
