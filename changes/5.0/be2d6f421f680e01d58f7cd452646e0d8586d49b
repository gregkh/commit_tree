mlxsw: spectrum: Properly cleanup LAG uppers when removing port from LAG

When a LAG device or a VLAN device on top of it is enslaved to a bridge,
the driver propagates the CHANGEUPPER event to the LAG's slaves.

This causes each physical port to increase the reference count of the
internal representation of the bridge port by calling
mlxsw_sp_port_bridge_join().

However, when a port is removed from a LAG, the corresponding leave()
function is not called and the reference count is not decremented. This
leads to ugly hacks such as mlxsw_sp_bridge_port_should_destroy() that
try to understand if the bridge port should be destroyed even when its
reference count is not 0.

Instead, make sure that when a port is unlinked from a LAG it would see
the same events as if the LAG (or its uppers) were unlinked from a
bridge.

The above is achieved by walking the LAG's uppers when a port is
unlinked and calling mlxsw_sp_port_bridge_leave() for each upper that is
enslaved to a bridge.
