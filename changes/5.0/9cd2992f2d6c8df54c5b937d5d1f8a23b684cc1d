fgraph: Have set_graph_notrace only affect function_graph tracer

In order to make the function graph infrastructure more generic, there can
not be code specific for the function_graph tracer in the generic code. This
includes the set_graph_notrace logic, that stops all graph calls when a
function in the set_graph_notrace is hit.

By using the trace_recursion mask, we can use a bit in the current
task_struct to implement the notrace code, and move the logic out of
fgraph.c and into trace_functions_graph.c and keeps it affecting only the
tracer and not all call graph callbacks.
