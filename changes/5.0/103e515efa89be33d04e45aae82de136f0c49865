nvme: add a numa_node field to struct nvme_ctrl

Instead of directly poking into the struct device add a new numa_node
field to struct nvme_ctrl.  This allows fabrics drivers where ctrl->dev
is a virtual device to support NUMA affinity as well.

Also expose the field as a sysfs attribute, and populate it for the
RDMA and FC transports.
