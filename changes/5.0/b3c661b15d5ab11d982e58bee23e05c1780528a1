blk-mq: support multiple hctx maps

Add support for the tag set carrying multiple queue maps, and
for the driver to inform blk-mq how many it wishes to support
through setting set->nr_maps.

This adds an mq_ops helper for drivers that support more than 1
map, mq_ops->rq_flags_to_type(). The function takes request/bio
flags and CPU, and returns a queue map index for that. We then
use the type information in blk_mq_map_queue() to index the map
set.
