pinctrl: imx: add imx8qxp driver

MX8QXP contains a system controller that is responsible for controlling
the pad setting of the IPs that are present. Communication between the
host processor running an OS and the system controller happens through
a SCU protocol. This patch adds the SCU based MX8QXP pinctrl driver.
