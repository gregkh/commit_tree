arm64: dts: allwinner: a64: Fix USB OTG regulator

Currently, AXP803 driver assumes that reg_drivevbus is input which is
wrong. Unfortunate consequence of that is that none of the USB ports
work on the board, even USB HOST port, because USB PHY driver probing
fails due to missing regulator.

Fix that by adding "x-powers,drive-vbus-en" property to AXP803 node.
