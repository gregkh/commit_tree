spi: spi-mem: Add a new API to support direct mapping

Most modern SPI controllers can directly map a SPI memory (or a portion
of the SPI memory) in the CPU address space. Most of the time this
brings significant performance improvements as it automates the whole
process of sending SPI memory operations every time a new region is
accessed.

This new API allows SPI memory drivers to create direct mappings and
then use them to access the memory instead of using spi_mem_exec_op().
