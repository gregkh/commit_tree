ASoC: sunxi: sun50i-codec-analog: Add support for cpvdd regulator supply

On the Allwinner A64 SoCs, the audio codec has a built-in headphone
amplifier. This amplifier has a power supply separate from the rest of
the analog audio circuitry, labeled cpvdd.

This patch adds a DAPM widget for this supply, and ties it to the
headphone amp widget.
