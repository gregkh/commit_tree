mfd: axp20x: Re-align MFD cell entries

In the axp20x driver, the various mfd_cell lists had varying amounts
of indentation, sometimes even within the same list. For the axp288,
there's no alignment at all.

Re-align the right hand side of the assignments with the least amount
of tabs possible. Also collapse the closing bracket and the opening
bracket of the next entry onto the same line for the axp288, to be
consistent with all the other mfd_cell lists.

This patch is whitespace change only. No functionality is modified.
