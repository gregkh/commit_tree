powerpc/mm: Move pte_fragment_alloc() to a common location

In preparation of next patch which generalises the use of
pte_fragment_alloc() for all, this patch moves the related functions
in a place that is common to all subarches.

The 8xx will need that for supporting 16k pages, as in that mode
page tables still have a size of 4k.

Since pte_fragment with only once fragment is not different
from what is done in the general case, we can easily migrate all
subarchs to pte fragments.
