serial: qcom_geni_serial: Finish supporting sysrq

The geni serial driver already had some sysrq code in it, but since
SUPPORT_SYSRQ wasn't defined the code didn't do anything useful.
Let's make it useful by adding that define using the same formula
found in other serial drivers.

In order to prevent deadlock, we'll take a page from the
'msm_serial.c' where the spinlock is released around
uart_handle_sysrq_char().  This seemed better than copying from
'8250_port.c' where we skip locking in the console_write function
since the '8250_port.c' method can cause lockdep warnings when
dropping into kgdb.
