ASoC: Intel: kbl_rt5660: Add a new machine driver for kbl with rt5660

The new Dell IoT platform uses kabylake + alc3277 codec, and alc3277
shares the driver with the codec rt5660, here we generate a new
machine driver based on kbl_da7219_max98357a.

The audio design on this IoT platform is as below:
 - Intel kabylake platform
 - connect the codec ALC3277 via SSP0
 - line-out and line-in with Micbias jacks
 - line-out mute control and jack detection of line-out and line-in
 - two HDMI ports with audio capability
