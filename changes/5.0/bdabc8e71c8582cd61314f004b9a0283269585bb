pstore: Do not use crash buffer for decompression

The pre-allocated compression buffer used for crash dumping was also
being used for decompression. This isn't technically safe, since it's
possible the kernel may attempt a crashdump while pstore is populating the
pstore filesystem (and performing decompression). Instead, just allocate
a separate buffer for decompression. Correctness is preferred over
performance here.
