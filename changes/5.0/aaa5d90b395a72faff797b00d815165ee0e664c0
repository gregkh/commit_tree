net: use indirect call wrappers at GRO network layer

This avoids an indirect calls for L3 GRO receive path, both
for ipv4 and ipv6, if the latter is not compiled as a module.

Note that when IPv6 is compiled as builtin, it will be checked first,
so we have a single additional compare for the more common path.

v1 -> v2:
 - adapted to INDIRECT_CALL_ changes
