mm: mmap: Allow for "high" userspace addresses

This patch adds support for "high" userspace addresses that are
optionally supported on the system and have to be requested via a hint
mechanism ("high" addr parameter to mmap).

Architectures such as powerpc and x86 achieve this by making changes to
their architectural versions of arch_get_unmapped_* functions. However,
on arm64 we use the generic versions of these functions.

Rather than duplicate the generic arch_get_unmapped_* implementations
for arm64, this patch instead introduces two architectural helper macros
and applies them to arch_get_unmapped_*:
 arch_get_mmap_end(addr) - get mmap upper limit depending on addr hint
 arch_get_mmap_base(addr, base) - get mmap_base depending on addr hint

If these macros are not defined in architectural code then they default
to (TASK_SIZE) and (base) so should not introduce any behavioural
changes to architectures that do not define them.
