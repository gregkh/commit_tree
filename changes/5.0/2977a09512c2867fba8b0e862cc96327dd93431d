scsi: lpfc: Fix link state reporting for trunking when adapter is offline

If the adapter is taken offline, the trunk link port attributes continue to
report trunk links as up even though all links are down as the adapter is
offline.

Clear the trunk links state as part of taking the adapter offline.
