can: dev: __can_get_echo_skb(): fix bogous check for non-existing skb by removing it

This patch revert commit 7da11ba5c506
("can: dev: __can_get_echo_skb(): print error message, if trying to echo non existing skb")

After introduction of this change we encountered following new error
message on various i.MX plattforms (flexcan):

| flexcan 53fc8000.can can0: __can_get_echo_skb: BUG! Trying to echo non
| existing skb: can_priv::echo_skb[0]

The introduction of the message was a mistake because
priv->echo_skb[idx] = NULL is a perfectly valid in following case: If
CAN_RAW_LOOPBACK is disabled (setsockopt) in applications, the pkt_type
of the tx skb's given to can_put_echo_skb is set to PACKET_LOOPBACK. In
this case can_put_echo_skb will not set priv->echo_skb[idx]. It is
therefore kept NULL.

As additional argument for revert: The order of check and usage of idx
was changed. idx is used to access an array element before checking it's
boundaries.
