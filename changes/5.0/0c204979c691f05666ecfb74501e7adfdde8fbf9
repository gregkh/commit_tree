mmc: core: Cleanup BKOPS support

It's been ~6 years ago since we introduced the BKOPS support for eMMC
cards. The current code is a bit messy and primarily that's because it
prepares to support running BKOPS in an asynchronous mode. However, that
mode has never been fully implemented/enabled. Instead BKOPS is always
executed in synchronously, when the card has reported an urgent BKOPS
level.

For these reasons, let's make the code more readable by dropping the unused
parts. Let's also rename mmc_start_bkops() to mmc_run_bkops(), as to make
it more descriptive.
