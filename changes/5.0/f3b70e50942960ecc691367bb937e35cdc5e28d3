arm64: kexec_file: allow for loading Image-format kernel

This patch provides kexec_file_ops for "Image"-format kernel. In this
implementation, a binary is always loaded with a fixed offset identified
in text_offset field of its header.

Regarding signature verification for trusted boot, this patch doesn't
contains CONFIG_KEXEC_VERIFY_SIG support, which is to be added later
in this series, but file-attribute-based verification is still a viable
option by enabling IMA security subsystem.

You can sign(label) a to-be-kexec'ed kernel image on target file system
with:
    $ evmctl ima_sign --key /path/to/private_key.pem Image

On live system, you must have IMA enforced with, at least, the following
security policy:
    "appraise func=KEXEC_KERNEL_CHECK appraise_type=imasig"
