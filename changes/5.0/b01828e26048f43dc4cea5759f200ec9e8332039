usb: renesas_usbhs: Remove dummy runtime PM callbacks

Platform drivers don't need dummy runtime PM callbacks that just return
success in order to have runtime PM happening. This has changed since
following commits:

commit 05aa55dddb9e ("PM / Runtime: Lenient generic runtime pm callbacks")
commit 543f2503a956 ("PM / platform_bus: Allow runtime PM by default")
commit 8b313a38ecff ("PM / Platform: Use generic runtime PM callbacks directly")
