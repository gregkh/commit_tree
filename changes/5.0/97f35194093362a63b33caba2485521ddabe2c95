scsi: mpt3sas: Fix driver modifying persistent data in Manufacturing page11

Currently driver is modifying both current & NVRAM/persistent data in
Manufacturing page11. Driver should change only current copy of
Manufacturing page11. It should not modify the persistent data.

So removed the section of code where driver is modifying the persistent
data of Manufacturing page11.
