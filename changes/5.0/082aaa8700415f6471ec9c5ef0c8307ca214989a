CIFS: Do not consider -ENODATA as stat failure for reads

When doing reads beyound the end of a file the server returns
error STATUS_END_OF_FILE error which is mapped to -ENODATA.
Currently we report it as a failure which confuses read stats.
Change it to not consider -ENODATA as failure for stat purposes.
