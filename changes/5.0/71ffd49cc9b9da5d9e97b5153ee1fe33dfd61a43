drm/i915/icl:Add Wa_1606682166

Incorrect TDL's SSP address shift in SARB for 16:6 & 18:8 modes.
Disable the Sampler state prefetch functionality in the SARB by
programming 0xB000[30] to '1'. This is to be done at boot time
and the feature must remain disabled permanently.

Fixes flaky tex-mip-level-selection* piglit tests with Mesa i965
driver.
