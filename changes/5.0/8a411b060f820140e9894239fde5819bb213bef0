KVM: arm/arm64: Remove arch timer workqueue

The use of a work queue in the hrtimer expire function for the bg_timer
is a leftover from the time when we would inject interrupts when the
bg_timer expired.

Since we are no longer doing that, we can instead call
kvm_vcpu_wake_up() directly from the hrtimer function and remove all
workqueue functionality from the arch timer code.
