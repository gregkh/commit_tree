mtd: rawnand: sunxi: Write pageprog related opcodes to WCMD_SET

The opcodes used by the controller when doing batched page prog should
be written in NFC_REG_WCMD_SET not FC_REG_RCMD_SET. Luckily, the
default NFC_REG_WCMD_SET value matches the one we set in the driver
which explains why we didn't notice the problem.
