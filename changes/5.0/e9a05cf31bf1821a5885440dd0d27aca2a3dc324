btrfs: remove unused drop_on_err in btrfs_mkdir

Up to commit 32955c5422a8 ("btrfs: switch to discard_new_inode()") the
drop_on_err variable in btrfs_mkdir() was used to check whether the
inode had to be dropped via iput().

After commit 32955c5422a8 ("btrfs: switch to discard_new_inode()")
discard_new_inode() is called when err is set and inode is non NULL.
Therefore drop_on_err is not used anymore and thus causes a warning when
building with -Wunused-but-set-variable.
