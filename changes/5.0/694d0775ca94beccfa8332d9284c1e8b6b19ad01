drm/amd: Don't fail on backlight = 0

Amgpu's backlight update status function was
returning 1 (an error value) when the backlight
property was 0.  This breaks users that assume
0 is a valid backlight value (which is a
correct assumption)

If the user passes in a backlight value of 0,
tell them everything is fine, then write a value of
1 to hardware.
