sbitmap: add helpers for add/del wait queue handling

After commit 5d2ee7122c73, users of sbitmap that need wait queue
handling must use the provided helpers. But we only added
prepare_to_wait()/finish_wait() style helpers, add the equivalent
add_wait_queue/list_del wrappers as we..

This is needed to ensure kyber plays by the sbitmap waitqueue
rules.
