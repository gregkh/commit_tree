selftests: explicitly require kernel features needed by udpgro tests

commit 3327a9c46352f1 ("selftests: add functionals test for UDP GRO")
make use of ipv6 NAT, but such a feature is not currently implied by
selftests. Since the 'ip[6]tables' commands may actually create nft rules,
depending on the specific user-space version, let's pull both NF and
NFT nat modules plus the needed deps.
