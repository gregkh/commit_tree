netfilter: nft_flow_offload: fix checking method of conntrack helper

This patch uses nfct_help() to detect whether an established connection
needs conntrack helper instead of using test_bit(IPS_HELPER_BIT,
&ct->status).

The reason is that IPS_HELPER_BIT is only set when using explicit CT
target.

However, in the case that a device enables conntrack helper via command
"echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_helper", the status of
IPS_HELPER_BIT will not present any change, and consequently it loses
the checking ability in the context.
