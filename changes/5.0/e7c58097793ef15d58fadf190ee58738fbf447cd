hugetlbfs: revert "Use i_mmap_rwsem to fix page fault/truncate race"

This reverts c86aa7bbfd5568ba8a82d3635d8f7b8a8e06fe54

The reverted commit caused ABBA deadlocks when file migration raced with
file eviction for specific hugetlbfs files.  This was discovered with a
modified version of the LTP move_pages12 test.

The purpose of the reverted patch was to close a long existing race
between hugetlbfs file truncation and page faults.  After more analysis
of the patch and impacted code, it was determined that i_mmap_rwsem can
not be used for all required synchronization.  Therefore, revert this
patch while working an another approach to the underlying issue.
