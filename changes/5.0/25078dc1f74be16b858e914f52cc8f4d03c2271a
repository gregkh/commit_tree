powerpc: use mm zones more sensibly

Powerpc has somewhat odd usage where ZONE_DMA is used for all memory on
common 64-bit configfs, and ZONE_DMA32 is used for 31-bit schemes.

Move to a scheme closer to what other architectures use (and I dare to
say the intent of the system):

 - ZONE_DMA: optionally for memory < 31-bit (64-bit embedded only)
 - ZONE_NORMAL: everything addressable by the kernel
 - ZONE_HIGHMEM: memory > 32-bit for 32-bit kernels

Also provide information on how ZONE_DMA is used by defining
ARCH_ZONE_DMA_BITS.

Contains various fixes from Benjamin Herrenschmidt.
