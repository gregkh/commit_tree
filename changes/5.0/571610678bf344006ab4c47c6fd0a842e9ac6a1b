pinctrl: imx: fix NO_PAD_CTL setting for MMIO pads

After patch b96eea718bf6 ("pinctrl: fsl: add scu based pinctrl support"),
NO_PAD_CTL pads map are not skipped anymore which results in
a possible memory corruption. As we actually only need to create config
maps for SCU pads and MMIO pads which are not using the default config
(a.k.a IMX_NO_PAD_CTL), so let's add a proper check before creating
the config maps. And during MMIO pads parsing, we also need update the
list_p point as SCU case to ensure the pin data next parsed is correct.
