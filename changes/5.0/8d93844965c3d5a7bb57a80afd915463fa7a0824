drm/vc4: Don't check plane state more than once

We are about to use vc4_plane_mode_set() in the async check path, but
async check can decide that async update is not possible and force the
driver to fallback to a sync update.

All the checks that have been done on the plane state during async check
stay valid, and checking it again is not necessary. Add a ->checked
field to vc4_plane_state, and use it to track the status of the state
(checked or not).
