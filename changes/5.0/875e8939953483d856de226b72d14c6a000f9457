skbuff: Rename 'offload_mr_fwd_mark' to 'offload_l3_fwd_mark'

Commit abf4bb6b63d0 ("skbuff: Add the offload_mr_fwd_mark field") added
the 'offload_mr_fwd_mark' field to indicate that a packet has already
undergone L3 multicast routing by a capable device. The field is used to
prevent the kernel from forwarding a packet through a netdev through
which the device has already forwarded the packet.

Currently, no unicast packet is routed by both the device and the
kernel, but this is about to change by subsequent patches and we need to
be able to mark such packets, so that they will no be forwarded twice.

Instead of adding yet another field to 'struct sk_buff', we can just
rename 'offload_mr_fwd_mark' to 'offload_l3_fwd_mark', as a packet
either has a multicast or a unicast destination IP.

While at it, add a comment about both 'offload_fwd_mark' and
'offload_l3_fwd_mark'.
