net: usb: aqc111: Initialize wol_cfg with memset in aqc111_suspend

Clang warns:

drivers/net/usb/aqc111.c:1326:37: warning: suggest braces around
initialization of subobject [-Wmissing-braces]
                struct aqc111_wol_cfg wol_cfg = { 0 };
                                                  ^
                                                  {}
1 warning generated.

Use memset to initialize the object to take compiler instrumentation out
of the equation.
