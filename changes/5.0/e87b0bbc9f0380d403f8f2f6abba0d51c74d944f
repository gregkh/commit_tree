drm/nouveau: Fix nv50_mstc->best_encoder()

As mentioned in the previous commit, we currently prevent new modesets
on recently-removed MST connectors by returning no encoder from our
->best_encoder() callback once the MST port has disappeared. This is
wrong however, because it prevents legacy modesetting users from being
able to disable CRTCs on MST connectors after the connector's respective
topology has disappeared.

So, fix this by instead by just always returning a valid encoder.

Changes since v2:
- Remove usage of atomic MST helper for now, since that got replaced
  with a much simpler solution
