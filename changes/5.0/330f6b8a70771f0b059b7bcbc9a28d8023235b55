nvme-fabrics: allow user to set nr_write_queues for separate queue maps

This argument will specify how many I/O queues will be connected in
create_ctrl in addition to nr_io_queues. With this configuration, I/O
that carries payload from the host to the target, will use the default
hctx queue map, and I/O that involves target to host transfers will use
the read hctx queue map.
