powerpc: generate uapi header and system call table files

System call table generation script must be run to gener-
ate unistd_32/64.h and syscall_table_32/64/c32/spu.h files.
This patch will have changes which will invokes the script.

This patch will generate unistd_32/64.h and syscall_table-
_32/64/c32/spu.h files by the syscall table generation
script invoked by parisc/Makefile and the generated files
against the removed files must be identical.

The generated uapi header file will be included in uapi/-
asm/unistd.h and generated system call table header file
will be included by kernel/systbl.S file.
