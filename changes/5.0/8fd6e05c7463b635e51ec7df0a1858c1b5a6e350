arch: riscv: support kernel command line forcing when no DTB passed

CONFIG_CMDLINE_FORCE doesn't work on RISC-V when no DTB is passed into
the kernel.  This is because the code that forces the kernel command
line only runs if a valid DTB is present at boot.  During debugging,
it's useful to have the ability to force kernel command lines even
when no DTB is present.  This patch adds support for doing so.
