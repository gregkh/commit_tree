iommu/vt-d: Leave scalable mode default off

Commit 765b6a98c1de3 ("iommu/vt-d: Enumerate the scalable
mode capability") enables VT-d scalable mode if hardware
advertises the capability. As we will bring up different
features and use cases to upstream in different patch
series, it will leave some intermediate kernel versions
which support partial features. Hence, end user might run
into problems when they use such kernels on bare metals
or virtualization environments.

This leaves scalable mode default off and end users could
turn it on with "intel-iommu=sm_on" only when they have
clear ideas about which scalable features are supported
in the kernel.
