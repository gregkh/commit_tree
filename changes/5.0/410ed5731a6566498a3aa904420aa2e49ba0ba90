drm/i915: Ensure intel_engine_init_execlist() builds with Clang

Clang build with UBSAN enabled leads to the following build error:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_engine_cs.o: In function `intel_engine_init_execlist':
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_engine_cs.c:411: undefined reference to `__compiletime_assert_411'

Again, for this to work the code would first need to be inlined and then
constant folded, which doesn't work for Clang because semantic analysis
happens before optimization/inlining.

Use GEM_BUG_ON() instead of BUILD_BUG_ON().

v2: Use is_power_of_2() from log2.h (Chris)
