btrfs: Introduce find_free_extent_ctl structure for later rework

Instead of tons of different local variables in find_free_extent(),
extract them into find_free_extent_ctl structure, and add better
explanation for them.

Some modification may looks redundant, but will later greatly simplify
function parameter list during find_free_extent() refactor.

Also add two comments to co-operate with fb5c39d7a887 ("btrfs: don't use
ctl->free_space for max_extent_size"), to make ffe_ctl->max_extent_size
update more reader-friendly.
