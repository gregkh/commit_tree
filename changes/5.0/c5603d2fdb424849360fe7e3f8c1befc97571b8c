USB: storage: don't insert sane sense for SPC3+ when bad sense specified

Currently the code will set US_FL_SANE_SENSE flag unconditionally if
device claims SPC3+, however we should allow US_FL_BAD_SENSE flag to
prevent this behavior, because SMI SM3350 UFS-USB bridge controller,
which claims SPC4, will show strange behavior with 96-byte sense
(put the chip into a wrong state that cannot read/write anything).

Check the presence of US_FL_BAD_SENSE when assuming US_FL_SANE_SENSE on
SPC4+ devices.
