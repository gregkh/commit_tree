platform/x86: Fix unmet dependency warning for ACPI_CMPC

Add BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT for ACPI_CMPC to fix the
warning: unmet direct dependencies detected for BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE.

ACPI_CMPC selects BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE but BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
depends on BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT.

Copy BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT dependency into ACPI_CMPC to fix

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for BACKLIGHT_CLASS_DEVICE
  Depends on [n]: HAS_IOMEM [=y] && BACKLIGHT_LCD_SUPPORT [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - ACPI_CMPC [=y] && X86 [=y] && X86_PLATFORM_DEVICES [=y] && ACPI [=y] && INPUT [=y] && (RFKILL [=n] || RFKILL [=n]=n)
