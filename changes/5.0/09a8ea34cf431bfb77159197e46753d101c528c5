staging: rtl8723bs: change semaphores to completions

This driver uses many semaphores, most of them are equivalent to
completions. The other copies of this driver got moved over to
completions a while ago, so do the same here.

In this usage scenario, the two are equivalent, so the behavior
should not change.
