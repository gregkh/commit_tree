net: hns3: add error handler for hclgevf_reset()

Since hclgevf_reset() may fail for some reasons, so it needs an error
handler to deal with it. When VF reset failed, VF can only be restored
by a higher level reset asserted by PF. So, it needs to reinitialize
its command queue, then it can respond to higher level reset.

Also, this patch adds error logging in the hclgevf_notify_client().
