drm/v3d: Fix a use-after-free race accessing the scheduler's fences.

Once we push the job, the scheduler could run it and free it.  So, if
we want to reference their fences, we need to grab them before then.
I haven't seen this happen in many days of conformance test runtime,
but let's still close the race.
