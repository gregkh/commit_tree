gpu: ipu-v3: ipu-ic: allow to manually set resize coefficients

For tiled scaling, we want to compute the scaling coefficients
externally in such a way that the interpolation overshoots tile
boundaries and samples up to the first pixel of the next tile.
Prepare to override the resizing coefficients from the image
conversion code.
