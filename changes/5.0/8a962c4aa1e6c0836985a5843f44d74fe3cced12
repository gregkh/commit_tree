geneve: Initialize addr6 with memset

Clang warns:

drivers/net/geneve.c:428:29: error: suggest braces around initialization
of subobject [-Werror,-Wmissing-braces]
                struct in6_addr addr6 = { 0 };
                                          ^
                                          {}

Rather than trying to appease the various compilers that support the
kernel, use memset, which is unambiguous.
