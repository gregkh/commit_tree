arm64: dts: meson: Fix mmc cd-gpios polarity

Commit 89a5e15bcba8 ("gpio/mmc/of: Respect polarity in the device tree")
changed the behavior of "cd-inverted" to follow the device tree bindings
specification:
According to SDHCI standard, CD lines are specified as "active low".
Using the "cd-inverted" property means that the CD line is "active high".

Fix the SD card description for meson by setting the cd-gpios as
"active low", according to the boards specifications, and dropping the
"cd-inverted" property.
