mmc: cqhci: Fix a tiny potential memory leak on error condition

Free up the allocated memory in the case of error return

The value of mmc_host->cqe_enabled stays 'false'. Thus, cqhci_disable
(mmc_cqe_ops->cqe_disable) won't be called to free the memory.  Also,
cqhci_disable() seems to be designed to disable and free all resources, not
suitable to handle this corner case.
