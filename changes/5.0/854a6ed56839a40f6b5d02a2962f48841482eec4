signal: Add restore_user_sigmask()

Refactor the logic to restore the sigmask before the syscall
returns into an api.
This is useful for versions of syscalls that pass in the
sigmask and expect the current->sigmask to be changed during
the execution and restored after the execution of the syscall.

With the advent of new y2038 syscalls in the subsequent patches,
we add two more new versions of the syscalls (for pselect, ppoll
and io_pgetevents) in addition to the existing native and compat
versions. Adding such an api reduces the logic that would need to
be replicated otherwise.
