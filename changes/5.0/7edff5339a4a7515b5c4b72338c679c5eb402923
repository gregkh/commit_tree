net: hns3: adjust the location of clearing the table when doing reset

When doing a function reset, the hardware table should be cleared
before the hardware reset. In current code, this clearing is done
in hns3_reset_notify_uninit_enet, but it is too late, because
the hardware reset is already done, hns3_reset_notify_down_enet
is more suitable to do that.
