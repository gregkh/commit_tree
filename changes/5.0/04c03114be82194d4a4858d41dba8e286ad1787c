tcp: clear icsk_backoff in tcp_write_queue_purge()

soukjin bae reported a crash in tcp_v4_err() handling
ICMP_DEST_UNREACH after tcp_write_queue_head(sk)
returned a NULL pointer.

Current logic should have prevented this :

  if (seq != tp->snd_una  || !icsk->icsk_retransmits ||
      !icsk->icsk_backoff || fastopen)
      break;

Problem is the write queue might have been purged
and icsk_backoff has not been cleared.
