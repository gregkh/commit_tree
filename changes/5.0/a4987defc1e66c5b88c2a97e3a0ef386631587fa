x86/hyper-v: Do some housekeeping in hyperv-tlfs.h

hyperv-tlfs.h is a bit messy: CPUID feature bits are not always sorted,
it's hard to get which CPUID they belong to, some items are duplicated
(e.g. HV_X64_MSR_CRASH_CTL_NOTIFY/HV_CRASH_CTL_CRASH_NOTIFY).

Do some housekeeping work. While on it, replace all (1 << X) with BIT(X)
macro.
