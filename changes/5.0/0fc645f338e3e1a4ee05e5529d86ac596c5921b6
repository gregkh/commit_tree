drm/i915/guc: Don't clear the cookie on doorbell destroy

If the HW has not processed the db invalidation request yet, clearing
the cookie can generate a db ring. We clear the cookie when we
(re-)allocate the doorbell so no need to do it on destroy as well as no
one is going to look at it while the doorbell is inactive
