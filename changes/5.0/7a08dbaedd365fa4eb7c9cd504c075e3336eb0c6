mtd: rawnand: Move ->setup_data_interface() to nand_controller_ops

->setup_data_interface() is a controller specific method and should
thus be placed in nand_controller_ops.

In order to make that work with controllers that support keeping
pre-configured timings we need to add a new NAND_KEEP_TIMINGS flag to
inform the core it should skip the timings selection step.
