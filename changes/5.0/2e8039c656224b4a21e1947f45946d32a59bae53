IB/core: uverbs copy to struct or zero helper

Add a helper to zero fill fields before copying data to
UVERBS_ATTR_STRUCT.

As UVERBS_ATTR_STRUCT can be used as an extensible struct, we want to make
sure that if the user supplies us with a struct that has new fields that
we are not aware of, we return them zeroed to the user.

This helper should be used when using UVERBS_ATTR_STRUCT for an extendable
data structure and there is a need to make sure that extended members of
the struct, that the kernel doesn't handle, are returned zeroed to the
user. This is needed due to the fact that UVERBS_ATTR_STRUCT allows
non-zero values for members after 'last' member.
