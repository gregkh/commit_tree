net: dsa: Add overhead to tag protocol ops.

Each DSA tag protocol needs to add additional headers to the Ethernet
frame in order to direct it towards a specific switch egress port. It
must also remove the head from a frame received from a
switch. Indicate the maximum size of these headers in the tag protocol
ops structure, so the core can take these overheads into account.
