libbpf: cleanup after partial failure in bpf_object__pin

bpftool will use bpf_object__pin in the next commits to pin all programs
and maps from the file; in case of a partial failure, we need to get
back to the clean state (undo previous program/map pins).

As part of a cleanup, I've added and exported separate routines to
pin all maps (bpf_object__pin_maps) and progs (bpf_object__pin_programs)
of an object.
