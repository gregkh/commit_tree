KVM: x86: Use jmp to invoke kvm_spurious_fault() from .fixup

____kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() provides a generic exception fixup
handler that is used to cleanly handle faults on VMX/SVM instructions
during reboot (or at least try to).  If there isn't a reboot in
progress, ____kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() treats any exception as
fatal to KVM and invokes kvm_spurious_fault(), which in turn generates
a BUG() to get a stack trace and die.

When it was originally added by commit 4ecac3fd6dc2 ("KVM: Handle
virtualization instruction #UD faults during reboot"), the "call" to
kvm_spurious_fault() was handcoded as PUSH+JMP, where the PUSH'd value
is the RIP of the faulting instructing.

The PUSH+JMP trickery is necessary because the exception fixup handler
code lies outside of its associated function, e.g. right after the
function.  An actual CALL from the .fixup code would show a slightly
bogus stack trace, e.g. an extra "random" function would be inserted
into the trace, as the return RIP on the stack would point to no known
function (and the unwinder will likely try to guess who owns the RIP).

Unfortunately, the JMP was replaced with a CALL when the macro was
reworked to not spin indefinitely during reboot (commit b7c4145ba2eb
"KVM: Don't spin on virt instruction faults during reboot").  This
causes the aforementioned behavior where a bogus function is inserted
into the stack trace, e.g. my builds like to blame free_kvm_area().

Revert the CALL back to a JMP.  The changelog for commit b7c4145ba2eb
("KVM: Don't spin on virt instruction faults during reboot") contains
nothing that indicates the switch to CALL was deliberate.  This is
backed up by the fact that the PUSH <insn RIP> was left intact.

Note that an alternative to the PUSH+JMP magic would be to JMP back
to the "real" code and CALL from there, but that would require adding
a JMP in the non-faulting path to avoid calling kvm_spurious_fault()
and would add no value, i.e. the stack trace would be the same.
