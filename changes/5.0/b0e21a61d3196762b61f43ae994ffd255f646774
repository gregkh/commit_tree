function_graph: Have profiler use new helper ftrace_graph_get_ret_stack()

The ret_stack processing is going to change, and that is going
to break anything that is accessing the ret_stack directly. One user is the
function graph profiler. By using the ftrace_graph_get_ret_stack() helper
function, the profiler can access the ret_stack entry without relying on the
implementation details of the stack itself.
