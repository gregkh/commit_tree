xfs: count inode blocks correctly in inobt scrub

A big block filesystem might require more than one inobt record to cover
all the inodes in the block.  In these cases it is not correct to round
the irec count up to the nearest block because this causes us to
overestimate the number of inode blocks we expect to find.
