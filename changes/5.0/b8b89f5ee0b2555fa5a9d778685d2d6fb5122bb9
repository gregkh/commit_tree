ASoC: simple-card-utils: fixup asoc_simple_card_get_dai_id() ID method

commit b6f3fc005a2c8 ("ASoC: simple-card-utils: fixup
asoc_simple_card_get_dai_id() counting") fixuped getting DAI ID method.
It will get DAI ID from OF graph "port", but, we want to consider about
"endpoint", too.
And, we also want to keep compatibility.

This patch fixup it as

	if (driver has specified DAI ID)
		use it as DAI ID
	else if (OF graph endpoint has reg)
		use it as DAI ID
	else if (OF graph port has reg)
		use it as DAI ID
	else
		use endpoint count as DAI ID
