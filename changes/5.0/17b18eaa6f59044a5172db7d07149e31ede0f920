scsi: qla2xxx: deadlock by configfs_depend_item

The intent of invoking configfs_depend_item in commit 7474f52a82d51
("tcm_qla2xxx: Perform configfs depend/undepend for base_tpg")
was to prevent a physical Fibre Channel port removal when
virtual (NPIV) ports announced through that physical port are active.
The change does not work as expected: it makes enabled physical port
dependent on target configfs subsystem (the port's parent), something
the configfs guarantees anyway.

Besides, scheduling work in a worker thread and waiting for the work's
completion is not really a valid workaround for the requirement not to call
configfs_depend_item from a configfs callback: the call occasionally
deadlocks.

Thus, removing configfs_depend_item calls does not break anything and fixes
the deadlock problem.
