bnxt_en: Support for 64-bit flow handle.

Older firmware only supports 16-bit flow handle, because of which the
number of flows that can be offloaded canâ€™t scale beyond a point.
Newer firmware supports 64-bit flow handle enabling the host to scale
upto millions of flows. With the new 64-bit flow handle support, driver
has to query flow stats in a different way compared to the older approach.

This patch adds support for 64-bit flow handle and new way to query
flow stats.
