ACPICA: Debugger: refactor to fix unused variable warning

When building ACPICA in the Linux kernel with Clang with ACPI_DISASSEMBLER
not defined, we get a the following warning on variable display_op:

warning: variable 'display_op' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Fix this by refactoring display_op and parent_op code in a separate function.
