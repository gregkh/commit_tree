cifs: we can not use small padding iovs together with encryption

We can not append small padding buffers as separate iovs when encryption is
used. For this case we must flatten the request into a single buffer
containing both the data from all the iovs as well as the padding bytes.

This is at least needed for 4.20 as well due to compounding changes.
