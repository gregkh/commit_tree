clk: meson: Mark some things static

These are missing 'static' so sparse complains:

drivers/clk/meson/vid-pll-div.c:58:26: warning: symbol '_get_table_val' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/clk/meson/gxbb.c:1585:12: warning: symbol 'gxbb_vid_pll_parent_names' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/clk/meson/gxbb.c:1620:12: warning: symbol 'gxbb_vclk_parent_names' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/clk/meson/gxbb.c:1980:12: warning: symbol 'gxbb_cts_parent_names' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/clk/meson/gxbb.c:2036:12: warning: symbol 'gxbb_cts_hdmi_tx_parent_names' was not declared. Should it be static?
