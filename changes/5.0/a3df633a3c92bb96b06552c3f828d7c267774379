net: sched: act_tunnel_key: fix NULL pointer dereference during init

Metadata pointer is only initialized for action TCA_TUNNEL_KEY_ACT_SET, but
it is unconditionally dereferenced in tunnel_key_init() error handler.
Verify that metadata pointer is not NULL before dereferencing it in
tunnel_key_init error handling code.
