net: dccp: fix kernel crash on module load

Patch eedbbb0d98b2 "net: dccp: initialize (addr,port) ..."
added calling to inet_hashinfo2_init() from dccp_init().

However, inet_hashinfo2_init() is marked as __init(), and
thus the kernel panics when dccp is loaded as module. Removing
__init() tag from inet_hashinfo2_init() is not feasible because
it calls into __init functions in mm.

This patch adds inet_hashinfo2_init_mod() function that can
be called after the init phase is done; changes dccp_init() to
call the new function; un-marks inet_hashinfo2_init() as
exported.
