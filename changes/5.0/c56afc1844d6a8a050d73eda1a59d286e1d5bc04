rtc: sun6i: Expose internal oscillator through device tree

The bindings have been updated to expose the RTC's internal oscillator,
for some SoCs that have it directly feeding the PRCM block. The changes
include the index 2 for the clock outputs, as well as the clock output
names.

This patch adds the internal oscillator to the list of clocks exposed
through of_clk_add_hw_provider(), and also have the driver optionally
fetch the name of the clock from the device tree if it's available.
