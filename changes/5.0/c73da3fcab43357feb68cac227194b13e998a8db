KVM: VMX: Properly handle dynamic VM Entry/Exit controls

EFER and PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL MSRs have dedicated VM Entry/Exit controls
that KVM dynamically toggles based on whether or not the guest's value
for each MSRs differs from the host.  Handle the dynamic behavior by
adding a helper that clears the dynamic bits so the bits aren't set
when initializing the VMCS field outside of the dynamic toggling flow.
This makes the handling consistent with similar behavior for other
controls, e.g. pin, exec and sec_exec.  More importantly, it eliminates
two global bools that are stealthily modified by setup_vmcs_config.

Opportunistically clean up a comment and print related to errata for
IA32_PERF_GLOBAL_CTRL.
