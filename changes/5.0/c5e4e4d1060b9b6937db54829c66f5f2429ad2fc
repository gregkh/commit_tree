octeontx2-af: Skip NIXLF check for bcast MCE entry

At the time of initial broadcast packet replication table init,
NIXLFs are not yet attached to PF_FUNCs. Hence skipped checking
NIXLF while submitting MCE entry init instruction to NIX admin queue.

Also did a minor cleanup while installing bcast match entry in
packet parser unit i.e NPC.
