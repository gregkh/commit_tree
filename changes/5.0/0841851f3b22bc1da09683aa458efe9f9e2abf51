drm/msm: dpu: Remove empty/useless labels

I noticed an empty label while driving by and decided to use
coccinelle to see if there were any more. Here's the spatch and the
invocation:
---

@@
identifier lbl;
expression E;
@@

- goto lbl;
+ return E;
...
- lbl:
        return E;

@@
identifier lbl;
@@

- goto lbl;
+ return;
...
- lbl:
-       return;
