ASoC: simple-card: tidyup mclk-fs method

Current simple-card is handling "mclk-fs" by many way.
But, it is not useful and readable.
We want to do is that allow having mclk-fs everywere.
This patch support it.
It will be overwrote if lower node has it.

sound {
	simple-audio-card,mclk-fs = <xxx>; // for initial

	simple-audio-card,dai-link {
		mclk-fs = <xxx>; // overwrite
		cpu {
			mclk-fs = <xxx>; // overwrite
		};
		codec {
			mclk-fs = <xxx>; // overwrite
		};
	};
};
