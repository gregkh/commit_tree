powerpc/8xx: Remove PTE_ATOMIC_UPDATES

commit 1bc54c03117b9 ("powerpc: rework 4xx PTE access and TLB miss")
introduced non atomic PTE updates and started the work of removing
PTE updates in TLB miss handlers, but kept PTE_ATOMIC_UPDATES for the
8xx with the following comment:
/* Until my rework is finished, 8xx still needs atomic PTE updates */

commit fe11dc3f9628e ("powerpc/8xx: Update TLB asm so it behaves as
linux mm expects") removed all PTE updates done in TLB miss handlers

Therefore, atomic PTE updates are not needed anymore for the 8xx
