usb: dwc2: host: use hrtimer for NAK retries

Modify the wait delay utilize the high resolution timer API to allow for
more precisely scheduled callbacks.

A previous commit added a 1ms retry delay after multiple consecutive
NAKed transactions using jiffies. On systems with a low timer interrupt
frequency, this delay may be significantly longer than specified,
resulting in misbehavior with some USB devices.

This scenario was reached on a Raspberry Pi 3B with a Macally FDD-USB
floppy drive (identified as 0424:0fdc Standard Microsystems Corp.
Floppy, based on the USB97CFDC USB FDC). With the relay delay, the drive
would be unable to mount a disk, replying with NAKs until the device was
reset.

Using ktime, the delta between starting the timer (in dwc2_hcd_qh_add)
and the callback function can be determined. With the original delay
implementation, this value was consistently approximately 12ms. (output
in us).

    <idle>-0     [000] ..s.  1600.559974: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 11976
    <idle>-0     [000] ..s.  1600.571974: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 11977
    <idle>-0     [000] ..s.  1600.583974: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 11976
    <idle>-0     [000] ..s.  1600.595974: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 11977

After converting the relay delay to using a higher resolution timer, the
delay was much closer to 1ms.

    <idle>-0     [000] d.h.  1956.553017: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 1002
    <idle>-0     [000] d.h.  1956.554114: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 1002
    <idle>-0     [000] d.h.  1957.542660: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 1004
    <idle>-0     [000] d.h.  1957.543701: dwc2_wait_timer_fn: wait_timer delta: 1002

The floppy drive operates properly with delays up to approximately 5ms,
and sends NAKs for any delays that are longer.
