ALSA: hda: Refactor display power management

The current HD-audio code manages the DRM audio power via too complex
redirections, and this seems even still unbalanced in a corner case as
Intel DRM CI has been intermittently reporting.  This patch is a big
surgery for addressing the complexity and the possible unbalance.

Basically the patch changes the display PM in the following ways:

- Both HD-audio controller and codec drivers call a single helper,
  snd_hdac_display_power().  (Formerly, the display power control from
  a codec was done indirectly via link_power bus ops.)

- snd_hdac_display_power() receives the codec address index.  For
  turning on/off from the controller, pass HDA_CODEC_IDX_CONTROLLER.

- snd_hdac_display_power() doesn't manage refcounts any longer, but
  keeps the power status in bitmap.  If any of controller or codecs is
  turned on, the function updates the DRM power state via get_power()
  or put_power().

Also this refactor allows us more cleanup:

- The link_power bus ops is dropped, so there is no longer indirect
  management, as mentioned in the above.

- hdac_device link_power_control flag is moved to hda_codec
  display_power_control flag, as it's only for HDA legacy.
