mm/hmm: fix memremap.h, move dev_page_fault_t callback to hmm

The kbuild robot reported the following on a development branch that used
memremap.h in a new path:

   In file included from arch/m68k/include/asm/pgtable_mm.h:148:0,
                     from arch/m68k/include/asm/pgtable.h:5,
                     from include/linux/memremap.h:7,
                     from drivers//dax/bus.c:3:
    arch/m68k/include/asm/motorola_pgtable.h: In function 'pgd_offset':
 >> arch/m68k/include/asm/motorola_pgtable.h:199:11: error: dereferencing pointer to incomplete type 'const struct mm_struct'
      return mm->pgd + pgd_index(address);
               ^~

The ->page_fault() callback is specific to HMM.  Move it to 'struct
hmm_devmem' where the unusual asm/pgtable.h dependency can be contained in
include/linux/hmm.h.  Longer term refactoring this dependency out of HMM
is recommended, but in the meantime memremap.h remains generic.
