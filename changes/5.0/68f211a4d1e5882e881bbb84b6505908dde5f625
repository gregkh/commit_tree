powerpc/pasemi: Add PCI initialisation for Nemo board.

The A-Eon Amigaone X1000's Nemo motherboard has an AMD SB600
connected to one of the PCI-e root ports on its PaSemi
Pwrficient 1628M SoC. Normally the SB600 southbridge would be
connected to a hidden PCI-e port on the system's northbridge,
and as a result doesn't fully comply with the PCI-e spec.

Add code to relax the PCI-e detection in both the root port
and the Linux kernel allowing on board devices to be detected.
