KVM: PPC: Book3S: Introduce new hcall H_COPY_TOFROM_GUEST to access quadrants 1 & 2

A guest cannot access quadrants 1 or 2 as this would result in an
exception. Thus introduce the hcall H_COPY_TOFROM_GUEST to be used by a
guest when it wants to perform an access to quadrants 1 or 2, for
example when it wants to access memory for one of its nested guests.

Also provide an implementation for the kvm-hv module.
