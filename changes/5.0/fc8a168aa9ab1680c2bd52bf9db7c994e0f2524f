btrfs: Check for missing device before bio submission in btrfs_map_bio

Before btrfs_map_bio submits all stripe bios it does a number of checks
to ensure the device for every stripe is present. However, it doesn't do
a DEV_STATE_MISSING check, instead this is relegated to the lower level
btrfs_schedule_bio (in the async submission case, sync submission
doesn't check DEV_STATE_MISSING at all). Additionally
btrfs_schedule_bios does the duplicate device->bdev check which has
already been performed in btrfs_map_bio.

This patch moves the DEV_STATE_MISSING check in btrfs_map_bio and
removes the duplicate device->bdev check. Doing so ensures that no bio
cloning/submission happens for both async/sync requests in the face of
missing device. This makes the async io submission path slightly shorter
in terms of instruction count. No functional changes.
