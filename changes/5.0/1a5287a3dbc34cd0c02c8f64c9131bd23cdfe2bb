gpio: mxc: move gpio noirq suspend/resume to syscore phase

During noirq suspend/resume phase, GPIO irq could arrive
and its registers like IMR will be changed by irq handle
process, to make the GPIO registers exactly when it is
powered ON after resume, move the GPIO noirq suspend/resume
callback to syscore suspend/resume phase, local irq is
disabled at this phase so GPIO registers are atomic.
