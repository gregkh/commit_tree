ASoC: audio-graph-scu-card: tidyup asoc_simple_card_parse_daifmt() timing

Current audio-graph-scu-card driver is parsing codec position for DPCM
and consider DAI format. But, current operation is doing totally pointless,
because 1) asoc_simple_card_parse_daifmt() will be called not only for 1st
codec on current implementation, and it will be used as fixed format
2) it should be called for each CPU/Codec pair.
Let's tidyup asoc_simple_card_parse_daifmt() timing.
