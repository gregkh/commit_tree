tracing: Use hist trigger's var_ref array to destroy var_refs

Since every var ref for a trigger has an entry in the var_ref[] array,
use that to destroy the var_refs, instead of piecemeal via the field
expressions.

This allows us to avoid having to keep and treat differently separate
lists for the action-related references, which future patches will
remove.
