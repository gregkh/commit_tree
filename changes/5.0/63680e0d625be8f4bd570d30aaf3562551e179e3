platform/x86: intel_ips: make PCI dependency explicit

After commit 5d32a66541c4 (PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without
CONFIG_PCI set) dependencies on CONFIG_PCI that previously were
satisfied implicitly through dependencies on CONFIG_ACPI have to be
specified directly.

intel_ips is a PCI device driver but this has not been mentioned
anywhere in Kconfig.
