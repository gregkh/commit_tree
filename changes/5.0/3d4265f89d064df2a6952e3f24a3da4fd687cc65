drm/sun4i: backend: Add a helper and a list for supported formats

In order to check whether the backend supports a specific format, an
explicit list and a related helper are introduced.

The prototype of this helper is added to the header so that it can be
called from sun4i_layer later (when introducing tiled mode support).
