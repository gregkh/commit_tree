tools/power turbosat: fix AMD APIC-id output

turbostat recently gained a feature adding APIC and X2APIC columns.
While they are disabled by-default, they are enabled with --debug
or when explicitly requested, eg.

$ sudo turbostat --quiet --show Package,Node,Core,CPU,APIC,X2APIC date

But these columns erroneously showed zeros on AMD hardware.
This patch corrects the APIC and X2APIC [sic] columns on AMD.
