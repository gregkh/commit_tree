Revert "socket: fix struct ifreq size in compat ioctl"

This reverts commit 1cebf8f143c2 ("socket: fix struct ifreq
size in compat ioctl"), it's a bugfix for another commit that
I'll revert next.

This is not a 'perfect' revert, I'm keeping some coding style
intact rather than revert to the state with indentation errors.
