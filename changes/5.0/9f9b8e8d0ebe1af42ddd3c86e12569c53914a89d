btrfs: extent-tree: Detect bytes_may_use underflow earlier

Although we have space_info::bytes_may_use underflow detection in
btrfs_free_reserved_data_space_noquota(), we have more callers who are
subtracting number from space_info::bytes_may_use.

So instead of doing underflow detection for every caller, introduce a
new wrapper update_bytes_may_use() to replace open coded bytes_may_use
modifiers.

This also introduce a macro to declare more wrappers, but currently
space_info::bytes_may_use is the mostly interesting one.
