selftests/powerpc: Add checks for transactional sigreturn

This is a new test case that creates a signal and starts a suspended
transaction inside the signal handler.

It returns from the signal handler with the CPU at suspended state, but
without setting user context MSR Transaction State (TS) field.

The kernel signal handler code should be able to handle this discrepancy
instead of crashing.

This code could be compiled and used to test 32 and 64-bits signal
handlers.
