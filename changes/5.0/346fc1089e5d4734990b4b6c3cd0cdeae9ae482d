blk-mq: export hctx->type in debugfs instead of sysfs

Now we only export hctx->type via sysfs, and there isn't such info
in hctx entry under debugfs. We often use debugfs only to diagnose
queue mapping issue, so add the support in debugfs.

Queue mapping becomes a bit more complicated after multiple queue
mapping is supported, we may write blktest to verify if queue mapping
is valid based on blk-mq-debugfs.

Given not necessary to export hctx->type twice, so remove the export
from sysfs.
