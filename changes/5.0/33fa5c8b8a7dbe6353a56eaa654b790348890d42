CIFS: Do not set credits to 1 if the server didn't grant anything

Currently we reset the number of total credits granted by the server
to 1 if the server didn't grant us anything int the response. This
violates the SMB3 protocol - we need to trust the server and use
the credit values from the response. Fix this by removing the
corresponding code.
