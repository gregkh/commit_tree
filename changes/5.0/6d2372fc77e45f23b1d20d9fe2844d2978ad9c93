ARM: dts: r8a7743: Remove legacy "renesas,rcar-thermal" compatibility

The thermal hardware description for the RZ/G1M SoC was added to its DTS
after the introduction of support for thermal zones, and included a
thermal-zones node from the beginning.

Hence there is no need to claim compatibility with
"renesas,rcar-thermal", which would be needed only for backwards
compatibility with kernels predating thermal zone support.
