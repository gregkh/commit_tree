net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: prevent interrupt storm caused by mv88e6390x_port_set_cmode

When debugging another issue I faced an interrupt storm in this
driver (88E6390, port 9 in SGMII mode), consisting of alternating
link-up / link-down interrupts. Analysis showed that the driver
wanted to set a cmode that was set already. But so far
mv88e6390x_port_set_cmode() doesn't check this and powers down
SERDES, what causes the link to break, and eventually results in
the described interrupt storm.

Fix this by checking whether the cmode actually changes. We want
that the very first call to mv88e6390x_port_set_cmode() always
configures the registers, therefore initialize port.cmode with
a value that is different from any supported cmode value.
We have to take care that we only init the ports cmode once
chip->info->num_ports is set.

v2:
- add small helper and init the number of actual ports only
