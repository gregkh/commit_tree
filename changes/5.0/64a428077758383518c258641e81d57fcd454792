tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Remove interrupt storm

Disable M_TX_FIFO_WATERMARK_EN after we've sent all data for a given
transaction so we don't continue to receive a flurry of free space
interrupts while waiting for the M_CMD_DONE notification. Re-enable the
watermark when establishing the next transaction.

Also clear the watermark interrupt after filling the FIFO so we do not
receive notification again prior to actually having free space.
