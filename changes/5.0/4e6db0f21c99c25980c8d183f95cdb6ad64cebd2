blk-mq: Add a NULL check in blk_mq_free_map_and_requests()

I recently found some code which called blk_mq_free_map_and_requests()
with a NULL set->tags pointer.  I fixed the caller, but it seems like a
good idea to add a NULL check here as well.  Now we can call:

	blk_mq_free_tag_set(set);
	blk_mq_free_tag_set(set);

twice in a row and it's harmless.
