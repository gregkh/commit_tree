IB/core: Add advise_mr to the list of known ops

We need to add advise_mr to the list of operation setters on the ib_device
or otherwise callers to ib_set_device_ops() for advise_mr operation will
not have their callback registered.

When the advise_mr series was merged with the device ops series the
SET_DEVICE_OPS() was missed.
