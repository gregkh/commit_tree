lightnvm: pblk: avoid ref warning on cache creation

The current kref implementation around pblk global caches triggers a
false positive on refcount_inc_checked() (when called) as the kref is
initialized to 0. Instead of usint kref_inc() on a 0 reference, which is
in principle correct, use kref_init() to avoid the check. This is also
more explicit about what actually happens on cache creation.

In the process, do a small refactoring to use kref helpers.
