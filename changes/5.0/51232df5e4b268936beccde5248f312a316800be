staging: erofs: fix race when the managed cache is enabled

When the managed cache is enabled, the last reference count
of a workgroup must be used for its workstation.

Otherwise, it could lead to incorrect (un)freezes in
the reclaim path, and it would be harmful.

A typical race as follows:

Thread 1 (In the reclaim path)  Thread 2
workgroup_freeze(grp, 1)                                refcnt = 1
...
workgroup_unfreeze(grp, 1)                              refcnt = 1
                                workgroup_get(grp)      refcnt = 2 (x)
workgroup_put(grp)                                      refcnt = 1 (x)
                                ...unexpected behaviors

* grp is detached but still used, which violates cache-managed
  freeze constraint.
