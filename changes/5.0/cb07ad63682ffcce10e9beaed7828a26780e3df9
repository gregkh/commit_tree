bcache: introduce force_wake_up_gc()

Garbage collection thread starts to work when c->sectors_to_gc is
negative value, otherwise nothing will happen even the gc thread is
woken up by wake_up_gc().

force_wake_up_gc() sets c->sectors_to_gc to -1 before calling
wake_up_gc(), then gc thread may have chance to run if no one else sets
c->sectors_to_gc to a positive value before gc_should_run().

This routine can be called where the gc thread is woken up and required
to run in force.
