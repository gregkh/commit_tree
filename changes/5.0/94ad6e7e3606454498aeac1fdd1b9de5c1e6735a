perf top: Use cond variable instead of a lock

Use conditional variable logic to synchronize between the reading and
processing threads. Currently it's done by having mutex around rotation
code.

Using a POSIX cond variable to sync both threads after queues rotation:

  Process thread:

    - Detects data
    - Switches queues
    - Sets rotate variable
    - Waits in pthread_cond_wait()

  Read thread:

    - Detects rotate is set
    - Kicks the process thread with a pthread_cond_signal()

After this rotation is safely completed and both threads can continue
with the new queue.
