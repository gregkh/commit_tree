Thermal: do not clear passive state during system sleep

commit ff140fea847e ("Thermal: handle thermal zone device properly
during system sleep") added PM hook to call thermal zone reset during
sleep. However resetting thermal zone will also clear the passive state
and thus cancel the polling queue which leads the passive cooling device
state not being cleared properly after sleep.

thermal_pm_notify => thermal_zone_device_reset set passive to 0
thermal_zone_trip_update will skip update passive as `old_target ==
instance->target'.
monitor_thermal_zone => thermal_zone_device_set_polling will cancel
tz->poll_queue, so the cooling device state will not be changed
afterwards.
