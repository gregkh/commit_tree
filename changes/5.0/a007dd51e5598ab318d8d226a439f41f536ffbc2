iommu/msm: Make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/iommu/Kconfig:config MSM_IOMMU
drivers/iommu/Kconfig:  bool "MSM IOMMU Support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init was not even used by this driver, the init ordering
remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
