xsk: Check if a queue exists during umem setup

In the xdp_umem_assign_dev() path, the xsk code does not
check if a queue for which umem is to be created exists.
It leads to a situation where umem is not assigned to any
Tx/Rx queue of a netdevice, without notifying the stack
about an error. This affects both XDP_SKB and XDP_DRV
modes - in case of XDP_DRV_ZC, queue index is checked by
the driver.

This patch fixes xsk code, so that in both XDP_SKB and
XDP_DRV mode of AF_XDP, an error is returned when requested
queue index exceedes an existing maximum.
