powerpc: Drop use of 'type' from access_ok()

In commit 05a4ab823983 ("powerpc/uaccess: fix warning/error with
access_ok()") an attempt was made to remove a warning by referencing
the variable `type`. However in commit 96d4f267e40f ("Remove 'type'
argument from access_ok() function") the variable `type` has been
removed, breaking the build:

  arch/powerpc/include/asm/uaccess.h:66:32: error: ‘type’ undeclared (first use in this function)

This essentially reverts commit 05a4ab823983 ("powerpc/uaccess: fix
warning/error with access_ok()") to fix the error.

Fixes: 96d4f267e40f ("Remove 'type' argument from access_ok() function")
