kvm: vmx: Document the need for MSR_STAR in i386 builds

Add a comment explaining why MSR_STAR must be included in
vmx_msr_index[] even for i386 builds.

The elided comment has not been relevant since move_msr_up() was
introduced in commit a75beee6e4f5d ("KVM: VMX: Avoid saving and
restoring msrs on lightweight vmexit").
