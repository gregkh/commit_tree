scsi: lpfc: Enable Management features for IF_TYPE=6

Addition of support for if_type=6 missed several checks for interface type,
resulting in the failure of several key management features such as
firmware dump and loopback testing.

Correct the checks on the if_type so that both SLI4 IF_TYPE's 2 and 6 are
supported.
