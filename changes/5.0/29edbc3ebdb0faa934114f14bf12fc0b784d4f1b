netfilter: ipset: Make invalid MAC address checks consistent

Set types bitmap:ipmac and hash:ipmac check that MAC addresses
are not all zeroes.

Introduce one missing check, and make the remaining ones
consistent, using is_zero_ether_addr() instead of comparing
against an array containing zeroes.

This was already done for hash:mac sets in commit 26c97c5d8dac
("netfilter: ipset: Use is_zero_ether_addr instead of static and
memcmp").
