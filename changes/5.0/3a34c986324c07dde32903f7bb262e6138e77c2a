cacheinfo: Keep the old value if of_property_read_u32 fails

Commit 448a5a552f336bd7b847b1951 ("drivers: base: cacheinfo: use OF
property_read_u32 instead of get_property,read_number") makes cache
size and number_of_sets be 0 if DT doesn't provide there values. I
think this is unreasonable so make them keep the old values, which is
the same as old kernels.
