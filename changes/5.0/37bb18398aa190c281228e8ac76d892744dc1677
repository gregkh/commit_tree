clk: sunxi-ng: a33: Use sigma-delta modulation for audio PLL

The audio blocks require specific clock rates. Until now we were using
the closest clock rate possible with integer N-M factors. This resulted
in audio playback being slightly slower than it should be.

The vendor kernel gets around this (for newer SoCs) by using sigma-delta
modulation to generate a fractional-N factor. As the PLL hardware is
identical in most chips, we can back port the settings from the newer
SoC, in this case the H3, onto the A33.
