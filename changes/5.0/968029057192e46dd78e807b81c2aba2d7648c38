drm/lease: look at ->universal_planes only once

It's lockless, and userspace might chance it underneath us. That's not
really a problem, all userspace gets is a slightly dysfunctional
lease with the current code. But this might change, and gcc might
decide to reload a few too many times, and then boom. So better safe
than sorry.

v2: Remove the now unused lessor_priv argument from validate_lease()
(Keith).

v3: Actually add everything ... silly me.
