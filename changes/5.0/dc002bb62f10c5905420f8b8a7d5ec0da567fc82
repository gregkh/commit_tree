bpf: add __weak hook for allocating executable memory

By default, BPF uses module_alloc() to allocate executable memory,
but this is not necessary on all arches and potentially undesirable
on some of them.

So break out the module_alloc() and module_memfree() calls into __weak
functions to allow them to be overridden in arch code.
