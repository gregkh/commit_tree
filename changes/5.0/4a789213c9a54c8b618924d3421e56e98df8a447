x86 uaccess: Introduce __put_user_goto

This is finally the actual reason for the odd error handling in the
"unsafe_get/put_user()" functions, introduced over three years ago.

Using a "jump to error label" interface is somewhat odd, but very
convenient as a programming interface, and more importantly, it fits
very well with simply making the target be the exception handler address
directly from the inline asm.

The reason it took over three years to actually do this? We need "asm
goto" support for it, which only became the default on x86 last year.
It's now been a year that we've forced asm goto support (see commit
e501ce957a78 "x86: Force asm-goto"), and so let's just do it here too.

[ Side note: this commit was originally done back in 2016. The above
  commentary about timing is obviously about it only now getting merged
  into my real upstream tree     - Linus ]

Sadly, gcc still only supports "asm goto" with asms that do not have any
outputs, so we are limited to only the put_user case for this.  Maybe in
several more years we can do the get_user case too.
