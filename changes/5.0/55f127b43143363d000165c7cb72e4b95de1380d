perf augmented_syscalls: Filter on a hard coded pid

Just to show where we'll hook pid based filters, and what we use to
obtain the current pid, using a BPF getpid() equivalent.

Now we need to remove that hardcoded PID with a BPF hash map, so that we
start by filtering 'perf trace's own PID, implement the --filter-pid
functionality, etc.
