drm/i915/icl: MBUS B credit change

No functional change. But just a minor change to keep
up with Spec, since it has changed since commit c3cc39c539d4
("drm/i915/icl: program mbus during pipe enable")

The instructions previously said to program pipe's
B credit = 24 / number of pipes, which is 8 for ICL.
Now the spec gives us direct values independent of number
of pipes. Let's keep in sync.

Also just a reorder on fields to make easier to compare
against spec's sequence: A -> BW -> B.
