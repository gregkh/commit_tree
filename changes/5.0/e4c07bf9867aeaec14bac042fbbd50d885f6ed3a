arm64: ftrace: Set FTRACE_MAY_SLEEP before ftrace_modify_all_code()

It has been reported that ftrace_replace_code() which is called by
ftrace_modify_all_code() can cause a soft lockup warning for an
allmodconfig kernel. This is because all the debug options enabled
causes the loop in ftrace_replace_code() (which loops over all the
functions being enabled where there can be 10s of thousands), is too
slow, and never schedules out.

To solve this, setting FTRACE_MAY_SLEEP to the command passed into
ftrace_replace_code() will make it call cond_resched() in the loop,
which prevents the soft lockup warning from triggering.
