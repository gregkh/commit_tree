drm/virtio: add virtio_gpu_alloc_fence()

Refactor fence creation, add fences to relevant GPU
operations and add cursor helper functions.

This removes the potential for allocation failures from the
cmd_submit and atomic_commit paths.
Now a fence will be allocated first and only after that
will we proceed with the rest of the execution.
