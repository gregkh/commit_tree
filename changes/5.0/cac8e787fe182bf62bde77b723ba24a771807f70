arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404-evb: add dts files for EVBs

QCS404 has two EVBs, EVB-1000 and EVB-4000. These boards are mostly
similar with few differences in the peripherals used.

So use a common qcs404-evb.dtsi which contains the common parts and use
qcs404-evb-1000.dts and qcs404-evb-4000.dts for diffs
