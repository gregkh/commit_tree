parisc: Fix ptrace syscall number modification

Commit 910cd32e552e ("parisc: Fix and enable seccomp filter support")
introduced a regression in ptrace-based syscall tampering: when tracer
changes syscall number to -1, the kernel fails to initialize %r28 with
-ENOSYS and subsequently fails to return the error code of the failed
syscall to userspace.

This erroneous behaviour could be observed with a simple strace syscall
fault injection command which is expected to print something like this:

$ strace -a0 -ewrite -einject=write:error=enospc echo hello
write(1, "hello\n", 6) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
write(2, "echo: ", 6) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
write(2, "write error", 11) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
write(2, "\n", 1) = -1 ENOSPC (No space left on device) (INJECTED)
+++ exited with 1 +++

After commit 910cd32e552ea09caa89cdbe328e468979b030dd it loops printing
something like this instead:

write(1, "hello\n", 6../strace: Failed to tamper with process 12345: unexpectedly got no error (return value 0, error 0)
) = 0 (INJECTED)

This bug was found by strace test suite.
