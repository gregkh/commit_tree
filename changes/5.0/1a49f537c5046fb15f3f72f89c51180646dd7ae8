drm/i915/huc: Normalize HuC status returned by I915_PARAM_HAS_HUC

In response for I915_PARAM_HAS_HUC we are returning value that
indicates if HuC firmware was loaded and verified. However, our
previously used positive value was based on specific register bit
which is about to change on future platform. Let's normalize our
return values to 0 and 1 before clients will start to use Gen9 value.

v2: use bool for implicit conversion (Chris)
