mm/page_alloc.c: drop uneeded __meminit and __meminitdata

Since commit 03e85f9d5f1 ("mm/page_alloc: Introduce
free_area_init_core_hotplug"), some functions changed to only be called
during system initialization.  Concretly, free_area_init_node() and the
functions that hang from it.

Also, some variables are no longer used after the system has gone
through initialization.  So this could be considered as a late clean-up
for that patch.

This patch changes the functions from __meminit to __init, and the
variables from __meminitdata to __initdata.

In return, we get some KBs back:

Before:
  Freeing unused kernel image memory: 2472K

After:
  Freeing unused kernel image memory: 2480K
