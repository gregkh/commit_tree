KVM: arm/arm64: Share common code in user_mem_abort()

The code for operations such as marking the pfn as dirty, and
dcache/icache maintenance during stage 2 fault handling is duplicated
between normal pages and PMD hugepages.

Instead of creating another copy of the operations when we introduce
PUD hugepages, let's share them across the different pagesizes.
