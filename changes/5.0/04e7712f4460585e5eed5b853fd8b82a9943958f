y2038: futex: Move compat implementation into futex.c

We are going to share the compat_sys_futex() handler between 64-bit
architectures and 32-bit architectures that need to deal with both 32-bit
and 64-bit time_t, and this is easier if both entry points are in the
same file.

In fact, most other system call handlers do the same thing these days, so
let's follow the trend here and merge all of futex_compat.c into futex.c.

In the process, a few minor changes have to be done to make sure everything
still makes sense: handle_futex_death() and futex_cmpxchg_enabled() become
local symbol, and the compat version of the fetch_robust_entry() function
gets renamed to compat_fetch_robust_entry() to avoid a symbol clash.

This is intended as a purely cosmetic patch, no behavior should
change.
