octeontx2-af: Workarounds for HW errata

Errata 35038
  Software sets NIX_AF_RX_SW_SYNC[ENA] to sync (flush) in-flight packets
  the RX data path before configuration changes (e.g. disabling one or
  more RQs). Hardware clears [ENA] to indicate sync is done

  An issue exists whereby NIX may clear NIX_AF_RX_SW_SYNC [ENA] too
  early.

Errata 35057
  NIX may corrupt internal state when conditional clocks turn off.
  So turnon all clocks by default.

Errata 35786
 Parse nibble enable NPC configuration for KEY generation has to be
 identical for both Rx and Tx interfaces.

Also corrected endianness configuration for NIX i.e NIX_AF_CFG[AF_BE]
is bit8 and not bit1.
