gfs2: Get rid of potential double-freeing in gfs2_create_inode

In gfs2_create_inode, after setting and releasing the acl / default_acl, the
acl / default_acl pointers are not set to NULL as they should be.  In that
state, when the function reaches label fail_free_acls, gfs2_create_inode will
try to release the same acls again.

Fix that by setting the pointers to NULL after releasing the acls.  Slightly
simplify the logic.  Also, posix_acl_release checks for NULL already, so
there is no need to duplicate those checks here.
