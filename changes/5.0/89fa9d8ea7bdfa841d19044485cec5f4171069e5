acpi/nfit, libnvdimm/security: add Intel DSM 1.8 master passphrase support

With Intel DSM 1.8 [1] two new security DSMs are introduced. Enable/update
master passphrase and master secure erase. The master passphrase allows
a secure erase to be performed without the user passphrase that is set on
the NVDIMM. The commands of master_update and master_erase are added to
the sysfs knob in order to initiate the DSMs. They are similar in opeartion
mechanism compare to update and erase.
