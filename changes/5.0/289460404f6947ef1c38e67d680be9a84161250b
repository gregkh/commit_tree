mlxsw: __mlxsw_sp_port_headroom_set(): Fix a use of local variable

The function-local variable "delay" enters the loop interpreted as delay
in bits. However, inside the loop it gets overwritten by the result of
mlxsw_sp_pg_buf_delay_get(), and thus leaves the loop as quantity in
cells. Thus on second and further loop iterations, the headroom for a
given priority is configured with a wrong size.

Fix by introducing a loop-local variable, delay_cells. Rename thres to
thres_cells for consistency.
