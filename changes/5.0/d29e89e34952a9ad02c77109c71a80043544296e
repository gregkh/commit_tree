drbd: narrow rcu_read_lock in drbd_sync_handshake

So far there was the possibility that we called
genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO)/mutex_lock() while holding an rcu_read_lock().

This included cases like:

drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
  drbd_asb_recover_1p
    drbd_khelper
      drbd_bcast_event
        genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO) --> may sleep

drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
  drbd_asb_recover_1p
    drbd_khelper
      notify_helper
        genlmsg_new(GFP_NOIO) --> may sleep

drbd_sync_handshake (acquire the RCU lock)
  drbd_asb_recover_1p
    drbd_khelper
      notify_helper
        mutex_lock --> may sleep

While using GFP_ATOMIC whould have been possible in the first two cases,
the real fix is to narrow the rcu_read_lock.
