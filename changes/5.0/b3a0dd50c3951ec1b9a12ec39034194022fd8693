btrfs: replace btrfs_io_bio::end_io with a simple helper

The end_io callback implemented as btrfs_io_bio_endio_readpage only
calls kfree. Also the callback is set only in case the csum buffer is
allocated and not pointing to the inline buffer. We can use that
information to drop the indirection and call a helper that will free the
csums only in the right case.

This shrinks struct btrfs_io_bio by 8 bytes.
