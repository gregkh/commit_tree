dma-mapping: return an error code from dma_mapping_error

Currently dma_mapping_error returns a boolean as int, with 1 meaning
error.  This is rather unusual and many callers have to convert it to
errno value.  The callers are highly inconsistent with error codes
ranging from -ENOMEM over -EIO, -EINVAL and -EFAULT ranging to -EAGAIN.
Return -ENOMEM which seems to be what the largest number of callers
convert it to, and which also matches the typical error case where
we are out of resources.
