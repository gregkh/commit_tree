drm/amd/display: set clocks to 0 on suspend on dce80

[Why]
When a dce80 asic was suspended, the clocks were not set to 0.
Upon resume, the new clock was compared to the existing clock,
they were found to be the same, and so the clock was not set.
This resulted in a blackscreen.

[How]
In atomic commit, check to see if there are any active pipes.
If no, set clocks to 0
