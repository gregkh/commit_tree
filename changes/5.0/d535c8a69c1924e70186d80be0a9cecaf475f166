netfilter: conntrack: udp: only extend timeout to stream mode after 2s

Currently DNS resolvers that send both A and AAAA queries from same source port
can trigger stream mode prematurely, which results in non-early-evictable conntrack entry
for three minutes, even though DNS requests are done in a few milliseconds.

Add a two second grace period where we continue to use the ordinary
30-second default timeout.  Its enough for DNS request/response traffic,
even if two request/reply packets are involved.

ASSURED is still set, else conntrack (and thus a possible
NAT mapping ...) gets zapped too in case conntrack table runs full.
