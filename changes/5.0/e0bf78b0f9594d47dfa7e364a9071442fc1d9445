powerpc/mm/iommu/vfio_spapr_tce: Change mm_iommu_get to reference a region

Normally mm_iommu_get() should add a reference and mm_iommu_put() should
remove it. However historically mm_iommu_find() does the referencing and
mm_iommu_get() is doing allocation and referencing.

We are going to add another helper to preregister device memory so
instead of having mm_iommu_new() (which pre-registers the normal memory
and references the region), we need separate helpers for pre-registering
and referencing.

This renames:
- mm_iommu_get to mm_iommu_new;
- mm_iommu_find to mm_iommu_get.

This changes mm_iommu_get() to reference the region so the name now
reflects what it does.

This removes the check for exact match from mm_iommu_new() as we want it
to fail on existing regions; mm_iommu_get() should be used instead.
