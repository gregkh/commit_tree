pwm: clps711x: Fix period calculation

Commit e39c0df1be5a ("pwm: Introduce the pwm_args concept") has
changed the variable for the period for clps711x-pwm driver, so now
pwm_get/set_period() works with pwm->state.period variable instead
of pwm->args.period.
This patch changes the period variable in other places where it is used.
