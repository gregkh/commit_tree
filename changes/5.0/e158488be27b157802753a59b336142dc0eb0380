locking/rwsem: Fix (possible) missed wakeup

Because wake_q_add() can imply an immediate wakeup (cmpxchg failure
case), we must not rely on the wakeup being delayed. However, commit:

  e38513905eea ("locking/rwsem: Rework zeroing reader waiter->task")

relies on exactly that behaviour in that the wakeup must not happen
until after we clear waiter->task.
