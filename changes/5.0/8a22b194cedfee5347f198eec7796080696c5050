ARM: dts: mmp2: add more TWSI controllers

I've gotten the base addresses, clocks and interrupts from an rusty and old
out-of-tree driver. I haven't actually checked against the datasheet, since
that one is reserved for the Marvell inner circle.

Tested with an accelerometer on TWSI6 on an OLPC XO 1.75 machine.
