drm/msm/gpu: Only store local command buffers in the GPU state

Instead of trying to store all the tagged buffers from a hanging
submit only store the command buffers that were not imported.
This cuts down on the amount of data stored in the GPU state to
the base minimum of useful information.

The downside is that this will make it more difficult to
successfully replay a hang with just the GPU state but there
isn't any reason why that functionality can't be added back
in later once we've figured out how to better communicate
such massive amounts of data.
