ALSA: firewire-tascam: add new hwdep ioctl command to get state image

In a previous commit, ALSA firewire-tascam driver stores state image
from tx isochronous packets. This image includes states of knob, fader,
button of control surface, level of gain/volume of each physical
inputs/outputs, and so on. It's useful for userspace applications to
read whole of the image.

This commit adds a unique ioctl command for ALSA hwdep interface for the
purpose. For actual meaning of each bits in this image, please refer to
discussion in alsa-devel[1].
