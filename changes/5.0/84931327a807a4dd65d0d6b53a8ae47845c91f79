arm64: ptr auth: Move per-thread keys from thread_info to thread_struct

We don't need to get at the per-thread keys from assembly at all, so
they can live alongside the rest of the per-thread register state in
thread_struct instead of thread_info.

This will also allow straighforward whitelisting of the keys for
hardened usercopy should we expose them via a ptrace request later on.
