rcutorture: Don't do busted forward-progress testing

The "busted" rcutorture type is an intentionally broken implementation
of RCU.  Doing forward-progress testing on this implementation is not
particularly meaningful on the one hand and can result in fatal abuse
of the memory allocator on the other.  This commit therefore disables
forward-progress testing of the "busted" rcutorture type.
