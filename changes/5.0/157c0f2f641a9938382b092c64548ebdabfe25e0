usb: typec: tcpm: charge current handling for sink during hard reset

During the initial connect to a non-pd port, sink would hard reset
twice before deeming that the port partner is non-pd. TCPM sets the
the charge path to false during the hard reset. This causes unnecessary
connects/disconnects of charge path and makes port take longer to
charge from the non-pd ports. Avoid this by not setting the charge path
to false unless the partner has already identified to be pd capable.

When partner is a pd port, set the charge path to false in
SNK_HARD_RESET_SINK_OFF. Set the current limits to default value based
of CC pull up and resume the charge path when port enters
SNK_HARD_RESET_SINK_ON.
