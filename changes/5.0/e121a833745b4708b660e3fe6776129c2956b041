driver core: Add missing dev->bus->need_parent_lock checks

__device_release_driver() has to check dev->bus->need_parent_lock
before dropping the parent lock and acquiring it again as it may
attempt to drop a lock that hasn't been acquired or lock a device
that shouldn't be locked and create a lock imbalance.

Fixes: 8c97a46af04b (driver core: hold dev's parent lock when needed)
