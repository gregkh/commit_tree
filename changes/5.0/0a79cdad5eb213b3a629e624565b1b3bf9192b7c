mm: use alloc_flags to record if kswapd can wake

This is a preparation patch that copies the GFP flag __GFP_KSWAPD_RECLAIM
into alloc_flags.  This is a preparation patch only that avoids having to
pass gfp_mask through a long callchain in a future patch.

Note that the setting in the fast path happens in alloc_flags_nofragment()
and it may be claimed that this has nothing to do with ALLOC_NO_FRAGMENT.
That's true in this patch but is not true later so it's done now for
easier review to show where the flag needs to be recorded.

No functional change.
