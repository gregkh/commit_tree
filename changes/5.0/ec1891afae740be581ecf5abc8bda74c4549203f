perf machine: Record if a arch has a single user/kernel address space

Some architectures have a single address space for kernel and user
addresses, which makes it possible to determine if an address is in
kernel space or user space. Some don't, e.g.: sparc.

Cache that info in perf_env so that, for instance, code needing to
fallback failed symbol lookups at the kernel space in single address
space arches can lookup at userspace.
