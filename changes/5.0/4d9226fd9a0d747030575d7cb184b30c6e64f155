arm64: defconfig: Re-enable bcm2835-thermal driver

The bcm2835-thermal driver was added with commit ac178e4280e6
("ARM64: bcm2835: add thermal driver to default config"). Unfortunately
this was accidentally dropped by commit eb1e6716cc9c
("arm64: defconfig: sync with savedefconfig"). So enable the driver again.

Fixes: eb1e6716cc9c ("arm64: defconfig: sync with savedefconfig")
