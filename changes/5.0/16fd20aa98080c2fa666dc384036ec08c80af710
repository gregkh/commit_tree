kbuild: Disable LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION with ftrace & GCC <= 4.7

When building using GCC 4.7 or older, -ffunction-sections & the -pg flag
used by ftrace are incompatible. This causes warnings or build failures
(where -Werror applies) such as the following:

  arch/mips/generic/init.c:
    error: -ffunction-sections disabled; it makes profiling impossible

This used to be taken into account by the ordering of calls to cc-option
from within the top-level Makefile, which was introduced by commit
90ad4052e85c ("kbuild: avoid conflict between -ffunction-sections and
-pg on gcc-4.7"). Unfortunately this was broken when the
CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION cc-option check was moved to
Kconfig in commit e85d1d65cd8a ("kbuild: test dead code/data elimination
support in Kconfig"), because the flags used by this check no longer
include -pg.

Fix this by not allowing CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION to be
enabled at the same time as ftrace/CONFIG_FUNCTION_TRACER when building
using GCC 4.7 or older.
