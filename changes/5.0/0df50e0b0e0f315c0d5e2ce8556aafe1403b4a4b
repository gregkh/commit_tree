perf trace: Avoid using raw_syscalls in duplicity with eBPF augmentation

So when we do something like:

   # perf trace -e open*,augmented_raw_syscalls.o

We need to set trace->trace_syscalls because there is logic that use
that when mixing strace-like output with other events, such as scheduler
tracepoints, but with that set we ended up having multiple
raw_syscalls:sys_{enter,exit} setup, which garbled the output, so
check if trace->augmented_raw_syscalls is set and avoid the two extra
tracepoints.
