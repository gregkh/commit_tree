rcu: Eliminate BUG_ON() for kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h

The tree_plugin.h file has a number of calls to BUG_ON(), which panics
the kernel, which is not a good strategy for devices (like embedded)
that don't have a way to capture console output.  This commit therefore
converts these BUG_ON() calls to WARN_ON_ONCE() and WARN_ONCE().
