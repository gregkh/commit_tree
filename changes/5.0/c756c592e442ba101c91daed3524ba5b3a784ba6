arm64: Utilize phys_initrd_start/phys_initrd_size

ARM64 is the only architecture that re-defines
__early_init_dt_declare_initrd() in order for that function to populate
initrd_start/initrd_end with physical addresses instead of virtual
addresses. Instead of having an override we can leverage
drivers/of/fdt.c populating phys_initrd_start/phys_initrd_size to
populate those variables for us.
