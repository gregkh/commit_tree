drivers: thermal: Move QCOM_SPMI_TEMP_ALARM into the qcom subdir

This cleans up the directory a bit allowing just one place to look for
thermal related drivers for QCOM platforms instead of being scattered in
the root directory and the qcom/ subdirectory. Compile-tested with
ARCH=arm64 defconfig and the driver explicitly enabled with menuconfig.
