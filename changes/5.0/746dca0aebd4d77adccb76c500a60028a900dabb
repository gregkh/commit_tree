ASoC: rt5663: Fix error handling of regulator_set_load

The default implementation of regulator_set_load returns
REGULATOR_MODE_NORMAL, which is positive.  [This was a bug which is
being fixed but the change is valid anyway -- bronie]

rt5663_i2c_probe should only do error handling when return value of
regulator_set_load is negative.
In this case, rt5663_i2c_probe should return error.

Also, consolidate err_irq into err_enable.

Fix the missing goto for temporary regmap and rt5663->regmap.
