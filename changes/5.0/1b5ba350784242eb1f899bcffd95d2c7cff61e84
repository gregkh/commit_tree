ARM: 8824/1: fix a migrating irq bug when hotplug cpu

Arm TC2 fails cpu hotplug stress test.

This issue was tracked down to a missing copy of the new affinity
cpumask for the vexpress-spc interrupt into struct
irq_common_data.affinity when the interrupt is migrated in
migrate_one_irq().

Fix it by replacing the arm specific hotplug cpu migration with the
generic irq code.

This is the counterpart implementation to commit 217d453d473c ("arm64:
fix a migrating irq bug when hotplug cpu").

Tested with cpu hotplug stress test on Arm TC2 (multi_v7_defconfig plus
CONFIG_ARM_BIG_LITTLE_CPUFREQ=y and CONFIG_ARM_VEXPRESS_SPC_CPUFREQ=y).
The vexpress-spc interrupt (irq=22) on this board is affine to CPU0.
Its affinity cpumask now changes correctly e.g. from 0 to 1-4 when
CPU0 is hotplugged out.
