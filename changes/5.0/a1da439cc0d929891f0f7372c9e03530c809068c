dma-mapping: fix lack of DMA address assignment in generic remap allocator

Commit bfd56cd60521 ("dma-mapping: support highmem in the generic remap
allocator") replaced dma_direct_alloc_pages() with __dma_direct_alloc_pages(),
which doesn't set dma_handle and zero allocated memory. Fix it by doing this
directly in the caller function.
