audit: Fix possible spurious -ENOSPC error

When an inode is tagged with a tree, tag_chunk() checks whether there is
audit_tree_group mark attached to the inode and adds one if not. However
nothing protects another tag_chunk() to add the mark between we've
checked and try to add the fsnotify mark thus resulting in an error from
fsnotify_add_mark() and consequently an ENOSPC error from tag_chunk().

Fix the problem by holding mark_mutex over the whole check-insert code
sequence.
