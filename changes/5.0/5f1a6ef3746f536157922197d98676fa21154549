rcu: Avoid signed integer overflow in rcu_preempt_deferred_qs()

Subtracting INT_MIN can be interpreted as unconditional signed integer
overflow, which according to the C standard is undefined behavior.
Therefore, kernel build arguments notwithstanding, it would be good to
future-proof the code.  This commit therefore substitutes INT_MAX for
INT_MIN in order to avoid undefined behavior.

While in the neighborhood, this commit also creates some meaningful names
for INT_MAX and friends in order to improve readability, as suggested
by Joel Fernandes.
