drm/i915: Combine multiple internal plists into the same i915_priolist bucket

As we are about to allow ourselves to slightly bump the user priority
into a few different sublevels, packthose internal priority lists
into the same i915_priolist to keep the rbtree compact and avoid having
to allocate the default user priority even after the internal bumping.
The downside to having an requests[] rather than a node per active list,
is that we then have to walk over the empty higher priority lists. To
compensate, we track the active buckets and use a small bitmap to skip
over any inactive ones.

v2: Use MASK of internal levels to simplify our usage.
v3: Prevent overflow when SHIFT is zero.
