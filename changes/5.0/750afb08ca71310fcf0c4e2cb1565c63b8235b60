cross-tree: phase out dma_zalloc_coherent()

We already need to zero out memory for dma_alloc_coherent(), as such
using dma_zalloc_coherent() is superflous. Phase it out.

This change was generated with the following Coccinelle SmPL patch:

@ replace_dma_zalloc_coherent @
expression dev, size, data, handle, flags;
@@

-dma_zalloc_coherent(dev, size, handle, flags)
+dma_alloc_coherent(dev, size, handle, flags)
