seccomp: fix UAF in user-trap code

On the failure path, we do an fput() of the listener fd if the filter fails
to install (e.g. because of a TSYNC race that's lost, or if the thread is
killed, etc.). fput() doesn't actually release the fd, it just ads it to a
work queue. Then the thread proceeds to free the filter, even though the
listener struct file has a reference to it.

To fix this, on the failure path let's set the private data to null, so we
know in ->release() to ignore the filter.
