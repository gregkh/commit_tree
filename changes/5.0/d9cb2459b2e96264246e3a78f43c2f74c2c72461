btrfs: tests: Use BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE to replace the intermediate number

In extent-io self test, we need 2 ordered extents at its maximum size to
do the test.

Instead of using the intermediate numbers, use BTRFS_MAX_EXTENT_SIZE for
@max_bytes, and twice @max_bytes for @total_dirty.  This should explain
why we need all these magic numbers and prevent people to modify them by
accident.
