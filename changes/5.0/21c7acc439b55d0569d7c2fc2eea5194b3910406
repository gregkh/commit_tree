h8300: pci: Remove local declaration of pcibios_penalize_isa_irq

h8300 builds fail with:

In file included from drivers/of/address.c:11:
include/linux/pci.h:1966:20: error: redefinition of 'pcibios_penalize_isa_irq'

This is because CONFIG_PCI is not enabled, and pcibios_penalize_isa_irq()
is now declared as inline static function in generic code if this is the
case. Since h8300 does not support PCI to start with, fix the problem by
removing the architecture specific pci.h.
