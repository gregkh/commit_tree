net/mlx5e: XDP, Change the XDP SQ redirect indication

Do not maintain an SQ state bit to indicate whether an
XDP SQ serves redirect operations.

Instead, rely on the fact that such an XDP SQ doesn't reside
in an RQ instance, while the others do.
This info is not known to the XDP SQ functions themselves,
and they rely on their callers to distinguish between the cases.
