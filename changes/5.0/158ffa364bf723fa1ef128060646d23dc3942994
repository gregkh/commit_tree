btrfs: only track ref_heads in delayed_ref_updates

We use this number to figure out how many delayed refs to run, but
__btrfs_run_delayed_refs really only checks every time we need a new
delayed ref head, so we always run at least one ref head completely no
matter what the number of items on it.  Fix the accounting to only be
adjusted when we add/remove a ref head.

In addition to using this number to limit the number of delayed refs
run, a future patch is also going to use it to calculate the amount of
space required for delayed refs space reservation.
