libbpf: make bpf_object__open default to UNSPEC

currently by default libbpf's bpf_object__open requires
bpf's program to specify  version in a code because of two things:
1) default prog type is set to KPROBE
2) KPROBE requires (in kernel/bpf/syscall.c) version to be specified

in this patch i'm changing default prog type to UNSPEC and also changing
requirments for version's section to be present in object file.
now it would reflect what we have today in kernel
(only KPROBE prog type requires for version to be explicitly set).

v1 -> v2:
 - RFC tag has been dropped
