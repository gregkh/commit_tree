lightnvm: simplify geometry enumeration

Currently the geometry of an OCSSD is enumerated using a two step
approach:

First, nvm_register is called, the OCSSD identify command is issued,
and second the geometry sos and csecs values are read either from the
OCSSD identify if it is a 1.2 drive, or from the NVMe namespace data
structure if it is a 2.0 device.

This patch recombines it into a single step, such that nvm_register can
use the csecs and sos fields independent of which version is used. This
enables one to dynamically size the lightnvm subsystem dma pool.
