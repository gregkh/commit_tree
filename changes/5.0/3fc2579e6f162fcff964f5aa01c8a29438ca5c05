fls: change parameter to unsigned int

When testing in userspace, UBSAN pointed out that shifting into the sign
bit is undefined behaviour.  It doesn't really make sense to ask for the
highest set bit of a negative value, so just turn the argument type into
an unsigned int.

Some architectures (eg ppc) already had it declared as an unsigned int,
so I don't expect too many problems.
