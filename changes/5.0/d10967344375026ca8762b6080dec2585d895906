ARM: dts: BCM5301X: Relicense BCM47094 file to the GPL 2.0+ / MIT

This matches licensing used by other BCM5301X files and is preferred as:
1) GPL 2.0+ makes it clearly compatible with Linux kernel
2) MIT is also permissive but preferred over ISC

This file has been developed by me & once modified by Vivek.
