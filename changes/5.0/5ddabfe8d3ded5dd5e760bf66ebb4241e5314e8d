gpio: lpc18xx: add GPIO pin interrupt controller support

The change adds support of LPC18xx/LPC43xx GPIO pin interrupt controller
block within SoC GPIO controller. The new interrupt controller driver
allows to configure and capture edge or level interrupts on 8 arbitrary
selectedinput GPIO pins, and lift the signals to be reported as NVIC rising
edge interrupts. Configuration of a particular GPIO pin to serve as
interrupt and its mapping to an interrupt on NVIC is done by SCU pin
controller, for more details see description of 'nxp,gpio-pin-interrupt'
device tree property of a GPIO pin [1].

From LPC18xx and LPC43xx User Manuals the GPIO controller consists of
the following blocks:
* GPIO pin interrupt block at 0x40087000, this change adds its support,
* GPIO GROUP0 interrupt block at 0x40088000,
* GPIO GROUP1 interrupt block at 0x40089000,
* GPIO port block at 0x400F4000, it is supported by the original driver.

While all 4 sub-controller blocks have their own I/O addresses, moreover
all 3 interrupt blocks are APB0 peripherals and high-speed GPIO block is
an AHB slave, according to the hardware manual the GPIO controller is
seen as a single block, and 4 sub-controllers have the shared reset signal
RGU #28 and clock to register interface CLK_CPU_GPIO on CCU1.

Likely support of two GPIO group interrupt blocks won't be added in short
term, because the mechanism to mask several interrupt sources is not well
defined.
