kbuild: use assignment instead of define ... endef for filechk_* rules

You do not have to use define ... endef for filechk_* rules.

For simple cases, the use of assignment looks cleaner, IMHO.

I updated the usage for scripts/Kbuild.include in case somebody
misunderstands the 'define ... endif' is the requirement.
