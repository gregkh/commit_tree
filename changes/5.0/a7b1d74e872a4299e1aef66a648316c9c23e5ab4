tracing: Change default buffer_percent to 50

After running several tests, it appears that having the reader wait till
half the buffer is full before starting to read (and causing its own events
to fill up the ring buffer constantly), works well. It keeps trace-cmd (the
main user of this interface) from dominating the traces it records.
