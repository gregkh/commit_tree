nvmem: add new config option

We want to add nvmem support for MTD. TI DaVinci is the first platform
that will be using it, but only in non-DT mode. In order not to
introduce any new interface to supporting of which we would have to
commit - add a new config option that tells nvmem not to use the DT
node of the parent device.

This way we won't be creating nvmem devices corresponding with MTD
partitions defined in device tree. By default MTD will set this new
field to true.

Once a set of bindings for MTD nvmem cells is agreed upon, we'll be
able to remove this option.
