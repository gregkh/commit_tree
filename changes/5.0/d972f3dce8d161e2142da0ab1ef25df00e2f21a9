packet: Do not leak dev refcounts on error exit

'dev' is non NULL when the addr_len check triggers so it must goto a label
that does the dev_put otherwise dev will have a leaked refcount.

This bug causes the ib_ipoib module to become unloadable when using
systemd-network as it triggers this check on InfiniBand links.
