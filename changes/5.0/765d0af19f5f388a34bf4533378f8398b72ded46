sched/topology: Remove the ::smt_gain field from 'struct sched_domain'

::smt_gain is used to compute the capacity of CPUs of a SMT core with the
constraint 1 < ::smt_gain < 2 in order to be able to compute number of CPUs
per core. The field has_free_capacity of struct numa_stat, which was the
last user of this computation of number of CPUs per core, has been removed
by:

  2d4056fafa19 ("sched/numa: Remove numa_has_capacity()")

We can now remove this constraint on core capacity and use the defautl value
SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE for SMT CPUs. With this remove, SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE
becomes the maximum compute capacity of CPUs on every systems. This should
help to simplify some code and remove fields like rd->max_cpu_capacity

Furthermore, arch_scale_cpu_capacity() is used with a NULL sd in several other
places in the code when it wants the capacity of a CPUs to scale
some metrics like in pelt, deadline or schedutil. In case on SMT, the value
returned is not the capacity of SMT CPUs but default SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE.

So remove it.
