net/mlx5e: In case of LAG, one switch parent id is used for all representors

When the uplink representors are put into lag, set all the
representors (VFs and uplinks) of the same NIC to return the same
switchdev id.

Currently, the route lookup code on the encapsulation offload path
assumes that same switchdev id for the source and dest devices means
that the dest is also mlx5 HW netdev. This doesn't hold anymore when we
align the switchdev Id of the uplinks to be same, which in turn causes
the bond/team to return that id to the caller. As such, enhance the
relevant check to take into account the uplink lag case.
