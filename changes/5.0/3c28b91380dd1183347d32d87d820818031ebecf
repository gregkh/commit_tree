media: stkwebcam: Bugfix for wrong return values

usb_control_msg returns in case of a successfully sent message the number
of sent bytes as a positive number. Don't use this value as a return value
for stk_camera_read_reg, as a non-zero return value is used as an error
condition in some cases when stk_camera_read_reg is called.
