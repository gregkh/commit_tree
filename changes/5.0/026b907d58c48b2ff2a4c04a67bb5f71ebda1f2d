net: qca_spi: Add available buffer space verification

Interferences on the SPI line could distort the response of
available buffer space. So at least we should check that the
response doesn't exceed the maximum available buffer space.
In error case increase a new error counter and retry it later.
This behavior avoids buffer errors in the QCA7000, which
results in an unnecessary chip reset including packet loss.
