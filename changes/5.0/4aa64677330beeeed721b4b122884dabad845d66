ARM: ks8695: fix section mismatch warning

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x13250): Section mismatch in reference from the function acs5k_i2c_init() to the (unknown reference) .init.data:(unknown)
The function acs5k_i2c_init() references
the (unknown reference) __initdata (unknown).
This is often because acs5k_i2c_init lacks a __initdata
annotation or the annotation of (unknown) is wrong.
