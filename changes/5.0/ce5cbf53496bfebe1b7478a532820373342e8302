ACPI: Set debug output flags independent of ACPICA

There was a divergence between Linux and ACPICA on the definition of
ACPI_DEBUG_DEFAULT. This divergence was solved by taking ACPICA's
definition in 4c1379d7bb42. After resolving the divergence, it was
clear that Linux users wanted to use their old set of debug flags.
This change fixes the divergence by setting these debug flags during
acpi_early_init() rather than during global variable initialization
in acpixf.h (owned by ACPICA).

Fixes: 4c1379d7bb42 ("ACPICA: Debug output: Add option to display method/object evaluation")
