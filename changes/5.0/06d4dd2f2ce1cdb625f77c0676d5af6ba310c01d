dma-mapping: deprecate dma_zalloc_coherent

We now always return zeroed memory from dma_alloc_coherent.  Note that
simply passing GFP_ZERO to dma_alloc_coherent wasn't always doing the
right thing to start with given that various allocators are not backed
by the page allocator and thus would ignore GFP_ZERO.
