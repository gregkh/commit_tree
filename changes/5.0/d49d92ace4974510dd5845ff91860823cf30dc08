mmc: sunxi: Disable HS-DDR mode for H5 eMMC controller by default

Some H5 boards seem to not have proper trace lengths for eMMC to be able
to use the default setting for the delay chains under HS-DDR mode. These
include the Bananapi M2+ H5 and NanoPi NEO Core2. However the Libre
Computer ALL-H3-CC-H5 works just fine.

For the H5 (at least for now), default to not enabling HS-DDR modes in
the driver, and expect the device tree to signal HS-DDR capability on
boards that work.
