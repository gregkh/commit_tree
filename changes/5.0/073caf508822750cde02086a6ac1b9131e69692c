net/mlx5e: Add sriov and udp tunnel ndo support for the uplink rep

Some of the sriov ndo calls are needed also on the switchdev mode -
e.g setup VF mac and reading vport stats. Add them to the uplink rep
netdev ops. Same for the UDP tunnel ones, need them there to identify
offloaded udp tunnel ports.
