ext4: avoid declaring fs inconsistent due to invalid file handles

If we receive a file handle, either from NFS or open_by_handle_at(2),
and it points at an inode which has not been initialized, and the file
system has metadata checksums enabled, we shouldn't try to get the
inode, discover the checksum is invalid, and then declare the file
system as being inconsistent.

This can be reproduced by creating a test file system via "mke2fs -t
ext4 -O metadata_csum /tmp/foo.img 8M", mounting it, cd'ing into that
directory, and then running the following program.

#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <fcntl.h>

struct handle {
	struct file_handle fh;
	unsigned char fid[MAX_HANDLE_SZ];
};

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
	struct handle h = {{8, 1 }, { 12, }};

	open_by_handle_at(AT_FDCWD, &h.fh, O_RDONLY);
	return 0;
}
