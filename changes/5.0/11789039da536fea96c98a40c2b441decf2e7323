fou: Prevent unbounded recursion in GUE error handler

Handling exceptions for direct UDP encapsulation in GUE (that is,
UDP-in-UDP) leads to unbounded recursion in the GUE exception handler,
syzbot reported.

While draft-ietf-intarea-gue-06 doesn't explicitly forbid direct
encapsulation of UDP in GUE, it probably doesn't make sense to set up GUE
this way, and it's currently not even possible to configure this.

Skip exception handling if the GUE proto/ctype field is set to the UDP
protocol number. Should we need to handle exceptions for UDP-in-GUE one
day, we might need to either explicitly set a bound for recursion, or
implement a special iterative handling for these cases.
