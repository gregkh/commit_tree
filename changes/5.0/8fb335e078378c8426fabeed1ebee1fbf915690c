kernel/exit.c: release ptraced tasks before zap_pid_ns_processes

Currently, exit_ptrace() adds all ptraced tasks in a dead list, then
zap_pid_ns_processes() waits on all tasks in a current pidns, and only
then are tasks from the dead list released.

zap_pid_ns_processes() can get stuck on waiting tasks from the dead
list.  In this case, we will have one unkillable process with one or
more dead children.

Thanks to Oleg for the advice to release tasks in find_child_reaper().
