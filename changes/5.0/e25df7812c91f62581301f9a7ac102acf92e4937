misc: ibmvsm: Fix potential NULL pointer dereference

There is a potential NULL pointer dereference in case kzalloc()
fails and returns NULL.

Fix this by adding a NULL check on *session*

Also, update the function header with information about the
expected return on failure and remove unnecessary variable rc.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
