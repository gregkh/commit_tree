libbpf: bpf_program__pin: add special case for instances.nr == 1

When bpf_program has only one instance, don't create a subdirectory with
per-instance pin files (<prog>/0). Instead, just create a single pin file
for that single instance. This simplifies object pinning by not creating
unnecessary subdirectories.

This can potentially break existing users that depend on the case
where '/0' is always created. However, I couldn't find any serious
usage of bpf_program__pin inside the kernel tree and I suppose there
should be none outside.
