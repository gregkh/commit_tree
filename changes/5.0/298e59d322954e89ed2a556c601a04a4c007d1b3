tools/bpf: fix bpftool map dump with bitfields

Commit 8772c8bc093b ("tools: bpftool: support pretty print
with kind_flag set") added bpftool map dump with kind_flag
support. When bitfield_size can be retrieved directly from
btf_member, function btf_dumper_bitfield() is called to
dump the bitfield. The implementation passed the
wrong parameter "bit_offset" to the function. The excepted
value is the bit_offset within a byte while the passed-in
value is the struct member offset.

This commit fixed the bug with passing correct "bit_offset"
with adjusted data pointer.
