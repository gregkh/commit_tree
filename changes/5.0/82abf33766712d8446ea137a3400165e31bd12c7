drm/sched: Always trace the dependencies we wait on, to fix a race.

The entity->dependency can go away completely once we've called
drm_sched_entity_add_dependency_cb() (if the cb is called before we
get around to tracing).  The tracepoint is more useful if we trace
every dependency instead of just ones that get callbacks installed,
anyway, so just do that.

Fixes any easy-to-produce OOPS when tracing the scheduler on V3D with
"perf record -a -e gpu_scheduler:.\* glxgears" and DEBUG_SLAB enabled.
