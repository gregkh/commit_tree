KEYS: user: Align the payload buffer

Align the payload of "user" and "logon" keys so that users of the
keyrings service can access it as a struct that requires more than
2-byte alignment.  fscrypt currently does this which results in the read
of fscrypt_key::size being misaligned as it needs 4-byte alignment.

Align to __alignof__(u64) rather than __alignof__(long) since in the
future it's conceivable that people would use structs beginning with
u64, which on some platforms would require more than 'long' alignment.
