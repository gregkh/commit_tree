phy: Use of_node_name_eq for node name comparisons

Convert string compares of DT node names to use of_node_name_eq helper
instead. This removes direct access to the node name pointer.

For instances using of_node_cmp, this has the side effect of now using
case sensitive comparisons. This should not matter for any FDT based
system which all of these are.
