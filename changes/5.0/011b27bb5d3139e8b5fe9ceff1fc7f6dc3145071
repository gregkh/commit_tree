sched/topology: Add lowest CPU asymmetry sched_domain level pointer

Add another member to the family of per-cpu sched_domain shortcut
pointers. This one, sd_asym_cpucapacity, points to the lowest level
at which the SD_ASYM_CPUCAPACITY flag is set. While at it, rename the
sd_asym shortcut to sd_asym_packing to avoid confusions.

Generally speaking, the largest opportunity to save energy via
scheduling comes from a smarter exploitation of heterogeneous platforms
(i.e. big.LITTLE). Consequently, the sd_asym_cpucapacity shortcut will
be used at first as the lowest domain where Energy-Aware Scheduling
(EAS) should be applied. For example, it is possible to apply EAS within
a socket on a multi-socket system, as long as each socket has an
asymmetric topology. Energy-aware cross-sockets wake-up balancing will
only happen when the system is over-utilized, or this_cpu and prev_cpu
are in different sockets.
