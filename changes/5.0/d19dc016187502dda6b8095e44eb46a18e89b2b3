fat: move MAX_FAT to fat.h and change it to inline function

MAX_FAT is useless in msdos_fs.h, since it uses the MSDOS_SB function
that is defined in fat.h.  So really, this macro can be only called from
code that already includes fat.h.

Hence, this patch moves it to fat.h, right after MSDOS_SB is defined.  I
also changed it to an inline function in order to save the double call
to MSDOS_SB.  This was suggested by joe@perches.com in the previous
version.

This patch is required for the next in the series, in which the variant
(whether this is FAT12, FAT16 or FAT32) checks are replaced with new
macros.
