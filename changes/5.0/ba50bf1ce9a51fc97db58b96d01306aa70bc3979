Drivers: hv: vmbus: Check for ring when getting debug info

fc96df16a1ce is good and can already fix the "return stack garbage" issue,
but let's also improve hv_ringbuffer_get_debuginfo(), which would silently
return stack garbage, if people forget to check channel->state or
ring_info->ring_buffer, when using the function in the future.

Having an error check in the function would eliminate the potential risk.

Add a Fixes tag to indicate the patch depdendency.
