cw1200: Fix concurrency use-after-free bugs in cw1200_hw_scan()

The function cw1200_bss_info_changed() and cw1200_hw_scan() can be
concurrently executed.
The two functions both access a possible shared variable "frame.skb".

This shared variable is freed by dev_kfree_skb() in cw1200_upload_beacon(),
which is called by cw1200_bss_info_changed(). The free operation is
protected by a mutex lock "priv->conf_mutex" in cw1200_bss_info_changed().

In cw1200_hw_scan(), this shared variable is accessed without the
protection of the mutex lock "priv->conf_mutex".
Thus, concurrency use-after-free bugs may occur.

To fix these bugs, the original calls to mutex_lock(&priv->conf_mutex) and
mutex_unlock(&priv->conf_mutex) are moved to the places, which can
protect the accesses to the shared variable.
