drm/vc4: ->x_scaling[1] should never be set to VC4_SCALING_NONE

For the YUV conversion to work properly, ->x_scaling[1] should never
be set to VC4_SCALING_NONE, but vc4_get_scaling_mode() might return
VC4_SCALING_NONE if the horizontal scaling ratio exactly matches the
horizontal subsampling factor. Add a test to turn VC4_SCALING_NONE
into VC4_SCALING_PPF when that happens.

The old ->x_scaling[0] adjustment is dropped as I couldn't find any
mention to this constraint in the spec and it's proven to be
unnecessary (I tested various multi-planar YUV formats with scaling
disabled, and all of them worked fine without this adjustment).
