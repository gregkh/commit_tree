KVM: x86: Fix single-step debugging

The single-step debugging of KVM guests on x86 is broken: if we run
gdb 'stepi' command at the breakpoint when the guest interrupts are
enabled, RIP always jumps to native_apic_mem_write(). Then other
nasty effects follow.

Long investigation showed that on Jun 7, 2017 the
commit c8401dda2f0a00cd25c0 ("KVM: x86: fix singlestepping over syscall")
introduced the kvm_run.debug corruption: kvm_vcpu_do_singlestep() can
be called without X86_EFLAGS_TF set.

Let's fix it. Please consider that for -stable.
