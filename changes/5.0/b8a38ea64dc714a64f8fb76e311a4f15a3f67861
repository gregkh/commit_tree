nvme: don't initlialize ctrl->cntlid twice

ctrl->cntlid will already be initialized from id->cntlid for
non-NVME_F_FABRICS controllers few lines below. For NVME_F_FABRICS
controllers this field should already be initialized, otherwise the
check

	if (ctrl->cntlid != le16_to_cpu(id->cntlid))

below will always be a no-op.
