include/linux/compiler*.h: fix OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR

Since commit 815f0ddb346c ("include/linux/compiler*.h: make compiler-*.h
mutually exclusive") clang no longer reuses the OPTIMIZER_HIDE_VAR macro
from compiler-gcc - instead it gets the version in
include/linux/compiler.h.  Unfortunately that version doesn't actually
prevent compiler from optimizing out the variable.

Fix up by moving the macro out from compiler-gcc.h to compiler.h.
Compilers without incline asm support will keep working
since it's protected by an ifdef.

Also fix up comments to match reality since we are no longer overriding
any macros.

Build-tested with gcc and clang.
