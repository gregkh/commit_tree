ARM: dts: aspeed: add missing memory unit-address

The base aspeed-g5.dtsi already defines a '/memory@80000000' node, so
'/memory' in the board files create a duplicate node. We're probably
getting lucky that the bootloader fixes up the memory node that the
kernel ends up using. Add the unit-address so it's merged with the base
node.

Found with DT json-schema checks.
