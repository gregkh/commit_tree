nvme: fix boot hang with only being able to get one IRQ vector

NVMe always asks for io_queues + 1 worth of IRQ vectors, which
means that even when we scale all the way down, we still ask
for 2 vectors and get -ENOSPC in return if the system can't
support more than 1.

Getting just 1 vector is fine, it just means that we'll have
1 IO queue and 1 admin queue, with a shared vector between them.
Check for this case and don't add our + 1 if it happens.
