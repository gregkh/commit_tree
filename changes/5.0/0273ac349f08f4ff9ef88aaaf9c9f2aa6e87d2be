blkcg: handle dying request_queue when associating a blkg

Between v3 [1] and v4 [2] of the blkg association series, the
association point moved from generic_make_request_checks(), which is
called after the request enters the queue, to bio_set_dev(), which is when
the bio is formed before submit_bio(). When the request_queue goes away,
the blkgs supporting the request_queue are destroyed and then the
q->root_blkg is set to %NULL.

This patch adds a %NULL check to blkg_tryget_closest() to prevent the
NPE caused by the above. It also adds a guard to see if the
request_queue is dying when creating a blkg to prevent creating a blkg
for a dead request_queue.
