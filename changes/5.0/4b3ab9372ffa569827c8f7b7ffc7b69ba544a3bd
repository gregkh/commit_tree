iio: adc: ti_am335x_tscadc: Improve accuracy of measurement

When performing single ended measurements with TSCADC, its recommended
to set negative input (SEL_INM_SWC_3_0) of ADC step to ADC's VREFN in the
corresponding STEP_CONFIGx register.

Also, the positive(SEL_RFP_SWC_2_0) and negative(SEL_RFM_SWC_1_0)
reference voltage for ADC step needs to be set to VREFP and VREFN
respectively in STEP_CONFIGx register.
Without these changes, there may be variation of as much as ~2% in the
ADC's digital output which is bad for precise measurement.
