rpc: properly check debugfs dentry before using it

debugfs can now report an error code if something went wrong instead of
just NULL.  So if the return value is to be used as a "real" dentry, it
needs to be checked if it is an error before dereferencing it.

This is now happening because of ff9fb72bc077 ("debugfs: return error
values, not NULL"), but why debugfs files are not being created properly
is an older issue, probably one that has always been there and should
probably be looked at...
