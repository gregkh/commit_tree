pinctrl: actions: define pad control configurtion to SoC specific

pad control for s900 and s700 are differs in number of
pull control configuraions
s900 has 4 pull controls - high impedence, pull up, pull down, repeater
s700, s500 has 2 pull controls - pull up and pull down

so pad control configuration has to SoC specific, moved out from pinctrl
common to s900 specific.
