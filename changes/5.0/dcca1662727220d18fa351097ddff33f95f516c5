nvme-pci: fix out of bounds access in nvme_cqe_pending

There is an out of bounds array access in nvme_cqe_peding().

When enable irq_thread for nvme interrupt, there is racing between the
nvmeq->cq_head updating and reading.

nvmeq->cq_head is updated in nvme_update_cq_head(), if nvmeq->cq_head
equals nvmeq->q_depth and before its value set to zero, nvme_cqe_pending()
uses its value as an array index, the index will be out of bounds.
