mips: loongson64: remove unreachable(), fix loongson_poweroff().

On my Yeeloong 8089, I noticed the machine fails to shutdown
properly, and often, the function mach_prepare_reboot() is
unexpectedly executed, thus the machine reboots instead. A
wait loop is needed to ensure the system is in a well-defined
state before going down.

In commit 997e93d4df16 ("MIPS: Hang more efficiently on
halt/powerdown/restart"), a general superset of the wait loop for all
platforms is already provided, so we don't need to implement our own.

This commit simply removes the unreachable() compiler marco after
mach_prepare_reboot(), thus allowing the execution of machine_hang().
My test shows that the machine is now able to shutdown successfully.

Please note that there are two different bugs preventing the machine
from shutting down, another work-in-progress commit is needed to
fix a lockup in cpufreq / i8259 driver, please read Reference, this
commit does not fix that bug.
