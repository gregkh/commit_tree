genirq: Make sure the initial affinity is not empty

If all CPUs in the irq_default_affinity mask are offline when an interrupt
is initialized then irq_setup_affinity() can set an empty affinity mask for
a newly allocated interrupt.

Fix this by falling back to cpu_online_mask in case the resulting affinity
mask is zero.
