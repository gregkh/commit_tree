libbpf: add internal pin_name

pin_name is the same as section_name where '/' is replaced
by '_'. bpf_object__pin_programs is converted to use pin_name
to avoid the situation where section_name would require creating another
subdirectory for a pin (as, for example, when calling bpf_object__pin_programs
for programs in sections like "cgroup/connect6").
