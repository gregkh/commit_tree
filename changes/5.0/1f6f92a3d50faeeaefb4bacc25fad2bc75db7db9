drm/i915: Relocate SKL+ NV12 src width w/a

The SKL+ NV12 src width alignment w/a is still living in an odd place.
Everything else was already relocated closer to the main plane check
function. Move this workaround as well.

As a bonus we avoid the funky rotated vs. not mess with the src
coordinates as this now gets checked before we rotate the coordinates.
