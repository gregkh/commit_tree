sctp: set flow sport from saddr only when it's 0

Now sctp_transport_pmtu() passes transport->saddr into .get_dst() to set
flow sport from 'saddr'. However, transport->saddr is set only when
transport->dst exists in sctp_transport_route().

If sctp_transport_pmtu() is called without transport->saddr set, like
when transport->dst doesn't exists, the flow sport will be set to 0
from transport->saddr, which will cause a wrong route to be got.

Commit 6e91b578bf3f ("sctp: re-use sctp_transport_pmtu in
sctp_transport_route") made the issue be triggered more easily
since sctp_transport_pmtu() would be called in sctp_transport_route()
after that.

In gerneral, fl4->fl4_sport should always be set to
htons(asoc->base.bind_addr.port), unless transport->asoc doesn't exist
in sctp_v4/6_get_dst(), which is the case:

  sctp_ootb_pkt_new() ->
    sctp_transport_route()

For that, we can simply handle it by setting flow sport from saddr only
when it's 0 in sctp_v4/6_get_dst().
