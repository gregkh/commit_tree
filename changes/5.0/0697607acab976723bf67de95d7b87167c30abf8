Bluetooth: btbcm: Add default address for BCM43430A0

The BCM43430A0 has the default MAC address 43:43:A0:12:1F:AC if none
is given. This address was found when enabling Bluetooth on a bunch of
boards with the AMPAK AP6210 module, all sharing the same address. It
also contains the sequence 4343A0, which is suspicious as that is also
the name the chip identifies itself as.

Add this to the list of default MAC addresses and leave it to the user
to configure a valid one.
