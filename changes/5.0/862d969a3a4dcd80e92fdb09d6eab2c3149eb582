net: hns3: do VF's pci re-initialization while PF doing FLR

While doing PF FLR, VF's PCIe configuration space will be cleared, so
the pci and vector of VF should be re-initialized in the VF's reset
process while PF doing FLR.

Also, this patch fixes some memory not freed problem when pci
re-initialization is done during reset process.
