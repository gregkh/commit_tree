jbd2: update locking documentation for transaction_t

The following members of struct transaction_s aka transaction_t
were turned into lock-free variables in the past:
- t_updates
- t_outstanding_credits
- t_handle_count
However, the documentation has not been updated yet.
This commit replaced the annotated lock by [none].
