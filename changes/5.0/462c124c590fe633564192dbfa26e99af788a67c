bpf: fix a libbpf loader issue

Commit 2993e0515bb4 ("tools/bpf: add support to read .BTF.ext sections")
added support to read .BTF.ext sections from an object file, create
and pass prog_btf_fd and func_info to the kernel.

The program btf_fd (prog->btf_fd) is initialized to be -1 to please
zclose so we do not need special handling dur prog close.
Passing -1 to the kernel, however, will cause loading error.
Passing btf_fd 0 to the kernel if prog->btf_fd is invalid
fixed the problem.
