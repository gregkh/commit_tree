Btrfs: remove no longer used io_err from btrfs_log_ctx

The io_err field of struct btrfs_log_ctx is no longer used after the
recent simplification of the fast fsync path, where we now wait for
ordered extents to complete before logging the inode. We did this in
commit b5e6c3e170b7 ("btrfs: always wait on ordered extents at fsync
time") and commit a2120a473a80 ("btrfs: clean up the left over
logged_list usage") removed its last use.
