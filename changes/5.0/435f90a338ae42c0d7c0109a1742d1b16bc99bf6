selftests/bpf: add a test case for sock_ops perf-event notification

This patch provides a tcp_bpf based eBPF sample. The test

- ncat(1) as the TCP client program to connect() to a port
  with the intention of triggerring SYN retransmissions: we
  first install an iptables DROP rule to make sure ncat SYNs are
  resent (instead of aborting instantly after a TCP RST)

- has a bpf kernel module that sends a perf-event notification for
  each TCP retransmit, and also tracks the number of such notifications
  sent in the global_map

The test passes when the number of event notifications intercepted
in user-space matches the value in the global_map.
