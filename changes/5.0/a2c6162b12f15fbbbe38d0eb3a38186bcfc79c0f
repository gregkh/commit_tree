net/mlx5: Support extended destination format in flow steering command

Update the flow steering command formatting according to the extended
destination API.
Note that the FW dictates that multi destination FTEs that involve at
least one encap must use the extended destination format, while single
destination ones must use the legacy format.
Using extended destination format requires FW support. Check for its
capabilities and return error if not supported.
