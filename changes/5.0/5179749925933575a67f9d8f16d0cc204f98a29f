drm/i915: Allocate a common scratch page

Currently we allocate a scratch page for each engine, but since we only
ever write into it for post-sync operations, it is not exposed to
userspace nor do we care for coherency. As we then do not care about its
contents, we can use one page for all, reducing our allocations and
avoid complications by not assuming per-engine isolation.

For later use, it simplifies engine initialisation (by removing the
allocation that required struct_mutex!) and means that we can always rely
on there being a scratch page.

v2: Check that we allocated a large enough scratch for I830 w/a
