net: stmmac: Prevent RX starvation in stmmac_napi_poll()

Currently, TX is given a budget which is consumed by stmmac_tx_clean()
and stmmac_rx() is given the remaining non-consumed budget.

This is wrong and in case we are sending a large number of packets this
can starve RX because remaining budget will be low.

Let's give always the same budget for RX and TX clean.

While at it, check if we missed any interrupts while we were in NAPI
callback by looking at DMA interrupt status.
