drm: fix null pointer dereference on null state pointer

In the case where state cannot be allocated, the current exit path via
label 'out' will dereference the null state pointer when calling
drm_atomic_state_put. Fix this by adding a new error exit label and
jumping to this to avoid the drm_atomic_state_put.
