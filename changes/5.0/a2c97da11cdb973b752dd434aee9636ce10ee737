audit: use session_info helper

There are still a couple of places (mark and watch config changes) that
open code auid and ses fields in sequence in records instead of using
the audit_log_session_info() helper.  Use the helper.  Adjust the helper
to accommodate being the first fields.  Passes audit-testsuite.
