netfilter: nat: remove nf_nat_l4proto struct

This removes the (now empty) nf_nat_l4proto struct, all its instances
and all the no longer needed runtime (un)register functionality.

nf_nat_need_gre() can be axed as well: the module that calls it (to
load the no-longer-existing nat_gre module) also calls other nat core
functions. GRE nat is now always available if kernel is built with it.
