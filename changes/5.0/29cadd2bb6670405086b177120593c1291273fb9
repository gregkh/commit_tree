scsi: Fix a harmless double shift bug

Smatch generates a warning:

    drivers/scsi/scsi_lib.c:1656 scsi_mq_done() warn: test_bit() takes a bit number

The problem is that SCMD_STATE_COMPLETE is supposed to be bit number 0
and not a mask like "(1 << 0)".  It is used like this:

        if (test_and_set_bit(SCMD_STATE_COMPLETE, &scmd->state))

The test_and_set_bit() has a shift built in so it's a double left shift
and uses bit number 1 instead of number 0.  This bug is harmless because
it's done consistently and it doesn't clash with any other flags.
