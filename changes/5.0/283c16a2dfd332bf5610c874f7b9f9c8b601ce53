indirect call wrappers: helpers to speed-up indirect calls of builtin

This header define a bunch of helpers that allow avoiding the
retpoline overhead when calling builtin functions via function pointers.
It boils down to explicitly comparing the function pointers to
known builtin functions and eventually invoke directly the latter.

The macros defined here implement the boilerplate for the above schema
and will be used by the next patches.

rfc -> v1:
 - use branch prediction hint, as suggested by Eric
v1  -> v2:
 - list explicitly the builtin function names in INDIRECT_CALL_*(),
   as suggested by Ed Cree
