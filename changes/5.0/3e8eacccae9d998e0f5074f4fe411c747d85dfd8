KVM: nVMX: Call nested_vmx_setup_ctls_msrs() iff @nested is true

...so that it doesn't need access to @nested. The only case where the
provided struct isn't already zeroed is the call from vmx_create_vcpu()
as setup_vmcs_config() zeroes the struct in the other use cases.  This
will allow @nested to be statically defined in vmx.c, i.e. this removes
the last direct reference from nested code.
