net: socionext: correctly recover txq after being full

Running pktgen with packets sizes > 512b ends up in the interface Txq
getting stuck.
"netsec 522d0000.ethernet eth0: netsec_netdev_start_xmit: TxQFull!"
appears on dmesg but the interface never recovers. It requires an
ifconfig down/up to make the interface usable again.

The reason that triggers this, is a race condition between
.ndo_start_xmit and the napi completion. The available budget is
calculated first and indicates the queue is full. Due to a costly
netif_err() the queue is not stopped in time while the napi completion
runs, clears the irq and frees up descriptors, thus the queue never wakes
up again.

Fix this by moving the print after stopping the queue, make the print
ratelimited, add barriers and check for cleaned descriptors..
