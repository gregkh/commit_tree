vxlan: Mark user-added FDB entries

The VXLAN driver needs to differentiate between FDB entries learned by
the VXLAN driver, and those added by the user. The latter ones shouldn't
be taken over by external learning events. This is in accordance with
bridge behavior.

Therefore, extend the flags bitfield to 16 bits and add a new private
NTF flag to mark the user-added entries.

This seems preferable to adding a dedicated boolean, because passing the
flag, unlike passing e.g. a true, makes it clear what the meaning of the
bit is.
