vgacon: unconfuse vc_origin when using soft scrollback

When CONFIG_VGACON_SOFT_SCROLLBACK is selected, the VGA display memory
index and vc_visible_origin don't change when scrollback is activated.
The actual screen content is saved away and the scrollbackdata is copied
over it. However the vt code, and /dev/vcs devices in particular, still
expect vc_origin to always point at the actual screen content not the
displayed scrollback content.

So adjust vc_origin to point at the saved screen content when scrollback
is active and set it back to vc_visible_origin when restoring the screen.

This fixes /dev/vcsa<n> that return scrollback content when they
shouldn't (onli /dev/vcsa without a number should), and also fixes
/dev/vcsu that should return scrollback content when scrollback is
active but currently doesn't.

An unnecessary call to vga_set_mem_top() is also removed.
