perf symbols: Filter out hidden symbols from labels

When perf is built with the annobin plugin (RHEL8 build) extra symbols
are added to its binary:

  # nm perf | grep annobin | head -10
  0000000000241100 t .annobin_annotate.c
  0000000000326490 t .annobin_annotate.c
  0000000000249255 t .annobin_annotate.c_end
  00000000003283a8 t .annobin_annotate.c_end
  00000000001bce18 t .annobin_annotate.c_end.hot
  00000000001bce18 t .annobin_annotate.c_end.hot
  00000000001bc3e2 t .annobin_annotate.c_end.unlikely
  00000000001bc400 t .annobin_annotate.c_end.unlikely
  00000000001bce18 t .annobin_annotate.c.hot
  00000000001bce18 t .annobin_annotate.c.hot
  ...

Those symbols have no use for report or annotation and should be
skipped.  Moreover they interfere with the DWARF unwind test on the PPC
arch, where they are mixed with checked symbols and then the test fails:

  # perf test dwarf -v
  59: Test dwarf unwind                                     :
  --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 8515
  unwind: .annobin_dwarf_unwind.c:ip = 0x10dba40dc (0x2740dc)
  ...
  got: .annobin_dwarf_unwind.c 0x10dba40dc, expecting test__arch_unwind_sample
  unwind: failed with 'no error'

The annobin symbols are defined as NOTYPE/LOCAL/HIDDEN:

  # readelf -s ./perf | grep annobin | head -1
    40: 00000000001bce4f     0 NOTYPE  LOCAL  HIDDEN    13 .annobin_init.c

They can still pass the check for the label symbol. Adding check for
HIDDEN and INTERNAL (as suggested by Nick below) visibility and filter
out such symbols.
