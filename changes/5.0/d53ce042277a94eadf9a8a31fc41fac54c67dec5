kmemleak: add config to select auto scan

Kmemleak scan can be cpu intensive and can stall user tasks at times.  To
prevent this, add config DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_AUTO_SCAN to enable/disable auto
scan on boot up.  Also protect first_run with DEBUG_KMEMLEAK_AUTO_SCAN as
this is meant for only first automatic scan.
