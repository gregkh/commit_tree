net: phy: icplus: rename IP101A_G_NO_IRQ to IP101A_G_IRQ_ALL_MASK

The datasheet uses the name "All Mask" for this bit. Change the name of
our #define to be consistent with the datasheet. While here also replace
the tab between the #define and IP101A_G_IRQ_ALL_MASK with a space.
No functional changes.
