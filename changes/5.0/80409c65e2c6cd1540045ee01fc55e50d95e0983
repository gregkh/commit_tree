mm: migrate: make buffer_migrate_page_norefs() actually succeed

Currently, buffer_migrate_page_norefs() was constantly failing because
buffer_migrate_lock_buffers() grabbed reference on each buffer.  In
fact, there's no reason for buffer_migrate_lock_buffers() to grab any
buffer references as the page is locked during all our operation and
thus nobody can reclaim buffers from the page.

So remove grabbing of buffer references which also makes
buffer_migrate_page_norefs() succeed.
