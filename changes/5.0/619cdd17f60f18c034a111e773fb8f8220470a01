pinctrl: meson: meson8: add the missing GPIO_GROUPs for BOOT and CARD

Add the BOOT and CARD pins as GROUP_GROUPs as well so they can be
configured in devicetree using groups = BOOTx or groups = CARDx. This
makes the behavior consistent with other pins inside the same driver as
well as with the BOOT and CARD pins of the GXBB and GXL pinctrl drivers.
