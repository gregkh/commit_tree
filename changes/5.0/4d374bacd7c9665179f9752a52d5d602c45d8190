pinctrl: sh-pfc: sh7734: Remove bogus IPSR10 value

The IP10[5:3] field in Peripheral Function Select Register 10 has a
width of 3 bits, i.e. it allows programming one out of 8 different
configurations.
However, 9 values are provided instead of 8, overflowing into the
subsequent field in the register, and thus breaking the configuration of
the latter.

Fix this by dropping a bogus zero value.
