hwmon (occ): Add sensor types and versions

Add structures to define all sensor types and versions. Add sysfs show
and store functions for each sensor type. Add a method to construct the
"set user power cap" command and send it to the OCC. Add rate limit to
polling the OCC (in case user-space reads our hwmon entries rapidly).
