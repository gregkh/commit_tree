qed: Fix LACP pdu drops for VFs

VF is always configured to drop control frames
(with reserved mac addresses) but to work LACP
on the VFs, it would require LACP control frames
to be forwarded or transmitted successfully.

This patch fixes this in such a way that trusted VFs
(marked through ndo_set_vf_trust) would be allowed to
pass the control frames such as LACP pdus.
