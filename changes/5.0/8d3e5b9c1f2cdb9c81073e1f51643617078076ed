clk: qcom: Add lpass clock controller driver for SDM845

Add support for the lpass clock controller found on SDM845 based devices.
This would allow lpass peripheral loader drivers to control the clocks to
bring the subsystem out of reset.
LPASS clocks present on the global clock controller would be registered
with the clock framework based on the protected-clock flag. Also do not
gate these clocks if they are left unused, as the lpass clocks require
the global clock controller lpass clocks to be enabled before they are
accessed. Mark the GCC lpass clocks as CRITICAL, for the LPASS clock
access.
