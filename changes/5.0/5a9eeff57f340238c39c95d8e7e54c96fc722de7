scsi: lpfc: Fix kernel Oops due to null pring pointers

Driver is hitting null pring pointers in lpfc_do_work().

Pointer assignment occurs based on SLI-revision. If recovering after an
error, its possible the sli revision for the port was cleared, making the
lpfc_phba_elsring() not return a ring pointer, thus the null pointer.

Add SLI revision checking to lpfc_phba_elsring() and status checking to all
callers.
