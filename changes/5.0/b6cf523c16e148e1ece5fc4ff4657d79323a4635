m68k: Unroll raw_outsb() loop

Unroll the raw_outsb() loop using the optimized assembler code from
raw_outsw(). That code is copied and pasted, with movew changed to moveb.

This improves the performance of sequential write transfers using mac_esp
in PIO mode by 5% or 10%. (The DMA controller on the 840av/660av models is
still unsupported so PIO transfers are used.)
