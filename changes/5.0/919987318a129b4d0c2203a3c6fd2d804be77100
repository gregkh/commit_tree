kbuild: generate asm-generic wrappers if mandatory headers are missing

Some time ago, Sam pointed out a certain degree of overwrap between
generic-y and mandatory-y. (https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/7/10/121)

I tweaked the meaning of mandatory-y a little bit; now it defines the
minimum set of ASM headers that all architectures must have.

If arch does not have specific implementation of a mandatory header,
Kbuild will let it fallback to the asm-generic one by automatically
generating a wrapper. This will allow to drop lots of redundant
generic-y defines.

Previously, "mandatory" was used in the context of UAPI, but I guess
this can be extended to kernel space ASM headers.
