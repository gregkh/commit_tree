ext4: fix a potential fiemap/page fault deadlock w/ inline_data

The ext4_inline_data_fiemap() function calls fiemap_fill_next_extent()
while still holding the xattr semaphore.  This is not necessary and it
triggers a circular lockdep warning.  This is because
fiemap_fill_next_extent() could trigger a page fault when it writes
into page which triggers a page fault.  If that page is mmaped from
the inline file in question, this could very well result in a
deadlock.

This problem can be reproduced using generic/519 with a file system
configuration which has the inline_data feature enabled.
