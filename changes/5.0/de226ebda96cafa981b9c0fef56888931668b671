regulator: bd718x7: Remove double indirection for bd718xx_pmic_inits.rdatas

With gcc 4.1:

    drivers/regulator/bd718x7-regulator.c: In function ‘bd718xx_probe’:
    drivers/regulator/bd718x7-regulator.c:1020: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
    drivers/regulator/bd718x7-regulator.c:1024: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type

Apparently this old compiler can't handle the obscure double
indirection.

However, there is no need for a double indirection.  Just store a
pointer to the array instead, like other drivers tend to do.
