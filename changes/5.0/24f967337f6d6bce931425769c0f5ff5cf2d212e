perf tests ARM: Disable breakpoint tests 32-bit

The breakpoint tests on the ARM 32-bit kernel are broken in several
ways.

The breakpoint length requested does not necessarily match whether the
function address has the Thumb bit (bit 0) set or not, and this does
matter to the ARM kernel hw_breakpoint infrastructure. See [1] for
background.

As Will indicated, the overflow handling would require single-stepping
which is not supported at the moment. Just disable those tests for the
ARM 32-bit platforms and update the comment above to explain these
limitations.
