ARM: dts: Add missing ranges for dra7 mcasp l3 ports

We need to add mcasp l3 port ranges for mcasp to use a correct l3
data port address for dma. And we're also missing the optional clocks
that we have tagged with HWMOD_OPT_CLKS_NEEDED in omap_hwmod_7xx_data.c.

Note that for reading the module revision register HWMOD_OPT_CLKS_NEEDED
do not seem to be needed. So they could be probably directly managed
only by the mcasp driver, and then we could leave them out for the
interconnect target module.

them with ti-sysc")
