ARM: dts: n900: fix mmc1 card detect gpio polarity

Wrong polarity of card detect GPIO pin leads to the system not
booting from external mmc, if the back cover of N900 is closed.
When the cover is open the system boots fine.

This wasn't noticed before, because of a bug, which was fixed
by commit e63201f19 (mmc: omap_hsmmc: Delete platform data GPIO
CD and WP).

Kernels up to 4.19 ignored the card detect GPIO from DT.
