ASoC: rsnd: add missing TDM Split mode support for simple-card

commit f69f452243e4e1 ("ASoC: rsnd: add TDM Split mode support")
added TDM Split mode support for rsnd driver.
But, it cares audio-graph-card style only. We can't use TDM Split
mode on simple-card style now.
This patch fixup this issue.
