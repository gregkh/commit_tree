kvm: x86: Report STIBP on GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID

Months ago, we have added code to allow direct access to MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL
to the guest, which makes STIBP available to guests.  This was implemented
by commits d28b387fb74d ("KVM/VMX: Allow direct access to
MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL") and b2ac58f90540 ("KVM/SVM: Allow direct access to
MSR_IA32_SPEC_CTRL").

However, we never updated GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID to let userspace know that
STIBP can be enabled in CPUID.  Fix that by updating
kvm_cpuid_8000_0008_ebx_x86_features and kvm_cpuid_7_0_edx_x86_features.
