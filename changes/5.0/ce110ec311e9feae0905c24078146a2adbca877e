drm/i915: Fix latency==0 handling for level 0 watermark on skl+

If the level 0 latency is 0 we can't do anything. Return an error
rather than success.

While this can't happen due to WaWmMemoryReadLatency, it can
happen if the user clears out the level 0 latency via debugfs.

v2: Clarify how how we can end here with zero level 0 latency (Matt)
