arm64: frace: use asm EXPORT_SYMBOL()

For a while now it's been possible to use EXPORT_SYMBOL() in assembly
files, which allows us to place exports immediately after assembly
functions, as we do for C functions.

As a step towards removing arm64ksyms.c, let's move the ftrace exports
to the assembly files the functions are defined in.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
