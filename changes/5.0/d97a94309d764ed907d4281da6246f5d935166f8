crypto: arm/chacha20 - add XChaCha20 support

Add an XChaCha20 implementation that is hooked up to the ARM NEON
implementation of ChaCha20.  This is needed for use in the Adiantum
encryption mode; see the generic code patch,
"crypto: chacha20-generic - add XChaCha20 support", for more details.

We also update the NEON code to support HChaCha20 on one block, so we
can use that in XChaCha20 rather than calling the generic HChaCha20.
This required factoring the permutation out into its own macro.
