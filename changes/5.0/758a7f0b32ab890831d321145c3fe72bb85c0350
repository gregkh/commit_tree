neighbor: Fix state check in neigh_forced_gc

PERMANENT entries are not on the gc_list so the state check is now
redundant. Also, the move to not purge entries until after 5 seconds
should not apply to FAILED entries; those can be removed immediately
to make way for newer ones. This restores the previous logic prior to
the gc_list.
