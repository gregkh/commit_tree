rocker, dsa, ethsw: Don't filter VLAN events on bridge itself

Due to an explicit check in rocker_world_port_obj_vlan_add(),
dsa_slave_switchdev_event() resp. port_switchdev_event(), VLAN objects
that are added to a device that is not a front-panel port device are
ignored. Therefore this check is immaterial.
