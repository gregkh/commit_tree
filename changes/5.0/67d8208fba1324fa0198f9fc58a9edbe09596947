crypto4xx_core: don't abuse __dma_sync_page

This function is internal to the DMA API implementation. Instead use
the DMA API to properly unmap. Note that the DMA API usage in this
driver is a disaster and urgently needs some work - it is missing all
the unmaps, seems to do a secondary map where it looks like it should
to a unmap in one place to work around cache coherency and the
directions passed in seem to be partially wrong.
