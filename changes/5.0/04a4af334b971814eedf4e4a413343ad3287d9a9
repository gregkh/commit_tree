openvswitch: Avoid OOB read when parsing flow nlattrs

For nested and variable attributes, the expected length of an attribute
is not known and marked by a negative number.  This results in an OOB
read when the expected length is later used to check if the attribute is
all zeros. Fix this by using the actual length of the attribute rather
than the expected length.
