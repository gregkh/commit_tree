ASoC: simple-scu-card: care link / dai count

In DPCM case, it uses CPU-dummy / dummy-Codec dai links.
If sound card is caring only DPCM, link count = dai count,
but, if non DPCM case, link count != dai count.
Now, we want to merge simple-card and simple-scu-card,
then, we need to care both link / dai count more carefly
This patch cares it, and prepare for merging simple card
