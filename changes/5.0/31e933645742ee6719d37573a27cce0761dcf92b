tty: serial: samsung: Properly set flags in autoCTS mode

Commit 391f93f2ec9f ("serial: core: Rework hw-assited flow control support")
has changed the way the autoCTS mode is handled.

According to that change, serial drivers which enable H/W autoCTS mode must
set UPSTAT_AUTOCTS to prevent the serial core from inadvertently disabling
TX. This patch adds proper handling of UPSTAT_AUTOCTS flag.
