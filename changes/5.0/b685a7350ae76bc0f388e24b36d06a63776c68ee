mm/page_io.c: fix polled swap page in

swap_readpage() wants to do polling to bring in pages if asked to, but
it doesn't mark the bio as being polled.  Additionally, the looping
around the blk_poll() check isn't correct - if we get a zero return, we
should call io_schedule(), we can't just assume that the bio has
completed.  The regular bio->bi_private check should be used for that.
