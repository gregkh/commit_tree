char: lp: use first unused lp number while registering

When the parallel port is usb based and the lp attaches to it based on
LP_PARPORT_AUTO, we do get /dev/lp0 and when we remove the usb device
/dev/lp0 is unregistered. But if we now reconnect the usb device we get
/dev/lp1, another disconnection and reconnection and we get /dev/lp2.

Use the port number array to find the first unused lp number and use
that to register the lp device with the parallel port.
