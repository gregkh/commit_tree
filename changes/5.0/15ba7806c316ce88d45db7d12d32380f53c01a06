scsi: libsas: Drop SAS_DPRINTK() and revise logs levels

Like sas_printk() did previously, SAS_DPRINTK() offers little value now
that libsas logs already have the "sas" prefix through pr_fmt(fmt). So it
can be dropped.

However, after reviewing some logs in libsas, it is noticed that debug
level is too low in many instances.

So this change drops SAS_DPRINTK() and revises some logs to a more
appropriate level. However many stay at debug level, although some
are significantly promoted.

We add -DDEBUG for compilation so that we keep the debug messages by
default, as before.

All the pre-existing checkpatch errors for spanning messages across
multiple lines are also fixed.

Finally, all other references to printk() [apart from special formatting
in sas_ata.c] are removed and replaced with appropriate pr_xxx().
