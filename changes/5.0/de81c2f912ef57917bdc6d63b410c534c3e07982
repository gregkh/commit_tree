KVM: x86: WARN_ONCE if sending a PV IPI returns a fatal error

KVM hypercalls return a negative value error code in case of a fatal
error, e.g. when the hypercall isn't supported or was made with invalid
parameters.  WARN_ONCE on fatal errors when sending PV IPIs as any such
error all but guarantees an SMP system will hang due to a missing IPI.
