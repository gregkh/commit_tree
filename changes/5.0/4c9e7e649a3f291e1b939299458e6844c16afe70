arm64: kexec_file: invoke the kernel without purgatory

On arm64, purgatory would do almost nothing. So just invoke secondary
kernel directly by jumping into its entry code.

While, in this case, cpu_soft_restart() must be called with dtb address
in the fifth argument, the behavior still stays compatible with kexec_load
case as long as the argument is null.
