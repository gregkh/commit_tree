KVM: VMX: Expose various module param vars via capabilities.h

Expose the variables associated with various module params that are
needed by the nested VMX code.  There is no ulterior logic for what
variables are/aren't exposed, this is purely "what's needed by the
nested code".

Note that @nested is intentionally not exposed.
