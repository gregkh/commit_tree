kasan: fix random seed generation for tag-based mode

There are two issues with assigning random percpu seeds right now:

1. We use for_each_possible_cpu() to iterate over cpus, but cpumask is
   not set up yet at the moment of kasan_init(), and thus we only set
   the seed for cpu #0.

2. A call to get_random_u32() always returns the same number and produces
   a message in dmesg, since the random subsystem is not yet initialized.

Fix 1 by calling kasan_init_tags() after cpumask is set up.

Fix 2 by using get_cycles() instead of get_random_u32(). This gives us
lower quality random numbers, but it's good enough, as KASAN is meant to
be used as a debugging tool and not a mitigation.
