bpf: btf: support proper non-jit func info

Commit 838e96904ff3 ("bpf: Introduce bpf_func_info")
added bpf func info support. The userspace is able
to get better ksym's for bpf programs with jit, and
is able to print out func prototypes.

For a program containing func-to-func calls, the existing
implementation returns user specified number of function
calls and BTF types if jit is enabled. If the jit is not
enabled, it only returns the type for the main function.

This is undesirable. Interpreter may still be used
and we should keep feature identical regardless of
whether jit is enabled or not.
This patch fixed this discrepancy.
