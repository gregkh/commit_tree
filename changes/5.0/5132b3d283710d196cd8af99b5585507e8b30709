spi: gpio: Support 3WIRE high-impedance turn-around

Some devices such as the TPO TPG110 display panel require
a "high-impedance turn-around", in effect a clock cycle after
switching the line from output to input mode.

Support this in the GPIO driver to begin with. Other driver
may implement it if they can, it is unclear if this can
be achieved with anything else than GPIO bit-banging.
