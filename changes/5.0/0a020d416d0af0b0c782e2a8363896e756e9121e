lib: introduce initial implementation of object aggregation manager

This lib tracks objects which could be of two types:
1) root object
2) nested object - with a "delta" which differentiates it from
                   the associated root object
The objects are tracked by a hashtable and reference-counted. User is
responsible of implementing callbacks to create/destroy root entity
related to each root object and callback to create/destroy nested object
delta.
