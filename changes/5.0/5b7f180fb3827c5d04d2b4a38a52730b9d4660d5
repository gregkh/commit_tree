arm64: defconfig: Enable core Qualcomm SDM845 options

Enable a few core config options to be able to boot SDM845 MTP.

The GCC, PINCTRL and GENI options are required to be able to boot to a
console. Several clocks from GCC are parented by the "bi_tcxo" clock
from the RPMH clock driver, so enable this to save others the time to
debug the missing parent clocks later. RPMH depends on the COMMAND_DB.
While we're enabling the others let's do RPMH regulators as well, as
everything beyond this point depends on that.
