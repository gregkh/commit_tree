KVM: x86: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c:1037:27: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
arch/x86/kvm/lapic.c:1876:3: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
