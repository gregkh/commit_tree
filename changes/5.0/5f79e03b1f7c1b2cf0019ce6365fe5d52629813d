drm/msm: dpu: Only check flush register against pending flushes

There exists a case where a flush of a plane/dma may have been triggered
& started from an async commit. If that plane/dma is subsequently disabled
by the next commit, the flush register will continue to hold the flush
bit for the disabled plane. Since the bit remains active,
pending_kickoff_cnt will never decrement and we'll miss frame_done
events.

This patch limits the check of flush_register to include only those bits
which have been updated with the latest commit.

Changes in v2:
- None
