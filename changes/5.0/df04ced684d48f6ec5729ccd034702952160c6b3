hwmon (occ): Add sysfs attributes for additional OCC data

The OCC provides a variety of additional information about the state of
the host processor, such as throttling, error conditions, and the number
of OCCs detected in the system. This information is essential to service
processor applications such as fan control and host management.
Therefore, export this data in the form of sysfs attributes attached to
the platform device (to which the hwmon device is also attached).
