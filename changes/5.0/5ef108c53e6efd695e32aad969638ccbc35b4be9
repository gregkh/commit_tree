ALSA: firewire-lib: use the same print format for 'without_header' tracepoints

An initial commit to add tracepoints for packets without CIP headers
uses different print formats for added tracepoints. However this is not
convenient for users/developers to prepare debug tools.

This commit uses the same format for the two tracepoints.
