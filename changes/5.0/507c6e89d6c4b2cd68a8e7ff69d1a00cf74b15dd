ARM: dts: sunxi: h3/h5: Fix up RTC device node and clock references

The RTC module on the H3 was claimed to be the same as on the A31, when
in fact it is not. The A31 does not have an RTC external clock output,
and its internal RC oscillator's average clock rate is not in the same
range. The H5's RTC has some extra crypto-related registers compared to
the H3. Their exact functions are not clear. Also the RTC-VIO regulator
has different settings.

This patch fixes the compatible string and clock properties to conform
to the updated bindings. The device node for the internal oscillator is
removed, as it is internalized into the RTC device. Clock references to
the IOSC and LOSC are also fixed.
