net: sched: prio: delay destroying child qdiscs on change

Move destroying of the old child qdiscs outside of the sch_tree_lock()
section.  This should improve the software qdisc replace but is even
more important for offloads.  Calling offloads under a spin lock is
best avoided, and child's destroy would be called under sch_tree_lock().
