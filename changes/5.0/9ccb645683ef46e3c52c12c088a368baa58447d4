altera-stapl: check for a null key before strcasecmp'ing it

Currently the null check on key is occurring after the strcasecmp on
the key, hence there is a potential null pointer dereference on key.
Fix this by checking if key is null first. Also replace the == 0
check on strcasecmp with just the ! operator.
