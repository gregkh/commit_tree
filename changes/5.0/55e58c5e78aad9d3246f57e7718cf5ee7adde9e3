lightnvm: Fix uninitialized return value in nvm_get_chunk_meta()

With gcc 4.1:

    drivers/lightnvm/core.c: In function ‘nvm_get_bb_meta’:
    drivers/lightnvm/core.c:977: warning: ‘ret’ may be used uninitialized in this function

and

    drivers/nvme/host/lightnvm.c: In function ‘nvme_nvm_get_chk_meta’:
    drivers/nvme/host/lightnvm.c:580: warning: ‘ret’ may be used uninitialized in this function

Indeed, if (for the former) the number of channels or LUNs is zero, or
(for both) the passed number of chunks is zero, ret will be returned
uninitialized.

Fix this by preinitializing ret to zero.
