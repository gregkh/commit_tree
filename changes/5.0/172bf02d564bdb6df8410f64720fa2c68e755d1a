perf trace: Fix ')' placement in "interrupted" syscall lines

When we get the sys_enter for a syscall we check if the last one is
still waiting for its matching sys_exit, if so we print this:

   468.753 (         ): firefox/32382 poll(ufds: 0x7f3988d3dd00, nfds: 7, timeout_msecs: 4294967295)     ...
   449.575 ( 0.004 ms): Softwar~cThrea/32434 futex(uaddr: 0x7f39a18a9b70, op: WAKE|PRIVATE_FLAG, val: 1)           = 0

At some point we'll get that poll sys_exit event and will print a "[continued]" line.

While making the sizing of the alignment after the syscall arg list and
its result configurable, so that we can mimic strace, which uses a
smaller alingment by default, a bug was introduced where the closing
parens appeared before the syscall name and its arg list, fix it.
