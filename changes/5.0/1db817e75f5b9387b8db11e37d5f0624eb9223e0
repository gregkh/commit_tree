net_sched: fix two more memory leaks in cls_tcindex

struct tcindex_filter_result contains two parts:
struct tcf_exts and struct tcf_result.

For the local variable 'cr', its exts part is never used but
initialized without being released properly on success path. So
just completely remove the exts part to fix this leak.

For the local variable 'new_filter_result', it is never properly
released if not used by 'r' on success path.
