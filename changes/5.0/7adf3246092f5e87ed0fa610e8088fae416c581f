ipv6: route: Fix return value of ip6_neigh_lookup() on neigh_create() error

In ip6_neigh_lookup(), we must not return errors coming from
neigh_create(): if creation of a neighbour entry fails, the lookup should
return NULL, in the same way as it's done in __neigh_lookup().

Otherwise, callers legitimately checking for a non-NULL return value of
the lookup function might dereference an invalid pointer.

For instance, on neighbour table overflow, ndisc_router_discovery()
crashes ndisc_update() by passing ERR_PTR(-ENOBUFS) as 'neigh' argument.
