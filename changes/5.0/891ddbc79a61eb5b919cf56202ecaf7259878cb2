gpio: Add devm_gpiod_unhinge()

This adds a function named devm_gpiod_unhinge() that removes
the resource management from a GPIO descriptor.

I am not sure if this is the best anglosaxon name for the
function, no other managed resources have an equivalent
currently, but I chose "unhinge" as the closest intuitive
thing I could imagine that fits Rusty Russell's API design
criterions "the obvious use is the correct one" and
"the name tells you how to use it".

The idea came out of a remark from Mark Brown that it should
be possible to handle over management of a resource from
devres to the regulator core, and indeed we can do that.
