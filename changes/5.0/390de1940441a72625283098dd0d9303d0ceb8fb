net/ibmvnic: Remove tests of member address

The driver was checking for non-NULL address.
- adapter->napi[i]

This is pointless as these will be always non-NULL, since the
'dapter->napi' is allocated in init_napi().
It is safe to get rid of useless checks for addresses to fix the
coccinelle warning:
>>drivers/net/ethernet/ibm/ibmvnic.c: test of a variable/field address
Since such statements always return true, they are redundant.
