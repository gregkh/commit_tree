kvm: Change offset in kvm_write_guest_offset_cached to unsigned

Since the offset is added directly to the hva from the
gfn_to_hva_cache, a negative offset could result in an out of bounds
write. The existing BUG_ON only checks for addresses beyond the end of
the gfn_to_hva_cache, not for addresses before the start of the
gfn_to_hva_cache.

Note that all current call sites have non-negative offsets.
