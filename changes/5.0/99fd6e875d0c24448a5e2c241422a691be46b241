RISC-V: Add _TIF_NEED_RESCHED check for kernel thread when CONFIG_PREEMPT=y

The cond_resched() can be used to yield the CPU resource if
CONFIG_PREEMPT is not defined. Otherwise, cond_resched() is a dummy
function. In order to avoid kernel thread occupying entire CPU,
when CONFIG_PREEMPT=y, the kernel thread needs to follow the
rescheduling mechanism like a user thread.
