loop: Move special partition reread handling in loop_clr_fd()

The call of __blkdev_reread_part() from loop_reread_partition() happens
only when we need to invalidate partitions from loop_release(). Thus
move a detection for this into loop_clr_fd() and simplify
loop_reread_partition().

This makes loop_reread_partition() safe to use without loop_ctl_mutex
because we use only lo->lo_number and lo->lo_file_name in case of error
for reporting purposes (thus possibly reporting outdate information is
not a big deal) and we are safe from 'lo' going away under us by
elevated lo->lo_refcnt.
