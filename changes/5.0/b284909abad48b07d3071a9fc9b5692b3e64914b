cpu/hotplug: Fix "SMT disabled by BIOS" detection for KVM

With the following commit:

  73d5e2b47264 ("cpu/hotplug: detect SMT disabled by BIOS")

... the hotplug code attempted to detect when SMT was disabled by BIOS,
in which case it reported SMT as permanently disabled.  However, that
code broke a virt hotplug scenario, where the guest is booted with only
primary CPU threads, and a sibling is brought online later.

The problem is that there doesn't seem to be a way to reliably
distinguish between the HW "SMT disabled by BIOS" case and the virt
"sibling not yet brought online" case.  So the above-mentioned commit
was a bit misguided, as it permanently disabled SMT for both cases,
preventing future virt sibling hotplugs.

Going back and reviewing the original problems which were attempted to
be solved by that commit, when SMT was disabled in BIOS:

  1) /sys/devices/system/cpu/smt/control showed "on" instead of
     "notsupported"; and

  2) vmx_vm_init() was incorrectly showing the L1TF_MSG_SMT warning.

I'd propose that we instead consider #1 above to not actually be a
problem.  Because, at least in the virt case, it's possible that SMT
wasn't disabled by BIOS and a sibling thread could be brought online
later.  So it makes sense to just always default the smt control to "on"
to allow for that possibility (assuming cpuid indicates that the CPU
supports SMT).

The real problem is #2, which has a simple fix: change vmx_vm_init() to
query the actual current SMT state -- i.e., whether any siblings are
currently online -- instead of looking at the SMT "control" sysfs value.

So fix it by:

  a) reverting the original "fix" and its followup fix:

     73d5e2b47264 ("cpu/hotplug: detect SMT disabled by BIOS")
     bc2d8d262cba ("cpu/hotplug: Fix SMT supported evaluation")

     and

  b) changing vmx_vm_init() to query the actual current SMT state --
     instead of the sysfs control value -- to determine whether the L1TF
     warning is needed.  This also requires the 'sched_smt_present'
     variable to exported, instead of 'cpu_smt_control'.
