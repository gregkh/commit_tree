serial: sh-sci: Resume PIO in sci_rx_interrupt() on DMA failure

On (H)SCIF, sci_submit_rx() is called in the receive interrupt handler.
Hence if DMA submission fails, the interrupt handler should resume
handling reception using PIO, else no more data is received.

Make sci_submit_rx() return an error indicator, so the receive interrupt
handler can act appropriately.
