media: Documentation/media: uapi: Explicitly say there are no Invariant Sections

The GNU Free Documentation License allows for a work to specify
Invariant Sections that are not allowed to be modified.  (Debian
considers that this makes such works non-free.)

The Linux Media Infrastructure userspace API documentation does not
specify any such sections, but it also doesn't say there are none (as
is recommended by the license text).  Make it explicit that there are
none.
