block: delete part_round_stats and switch to less precise counting

We want to convert to per-cpu in_flight counters.

The function part_round_stats needs the in_flight counter every jiffy, it
would be too costly to sum all the percpu variables every jiffy, so it
must be deleted. part_round_stats is used to calculate two counters -
time_in_queue and io_ticks.

time_in_queue can be calculated without part_round_stats, by adding the
duration of the I/O when the I/O ends (the value is almost as exact as the
previously calculated value, except that time for in-progress I/Os is not
counted).

io_ticks can be approximated by increasing the value when I/O is started
or ended and the jiffies value has changed. If the I/Os take less than a
jiffy, the value is as exact as the previously calculated value. If the
I/Os take more than a jiffy, io_ticks can drift behind the previously
calculated value.
