audit_tree: Remove mark->lock locking

Currently, audit_tree code uses mark->lock to protect against detaching
of mark from an inode. In most places it however also uses
mark->group->mark_mutex (as we need to atomically replace attached
marks) and this provides protection against mark detaching as well. So
just remove protection with mark->lock from audit tree code and replace
it with mark->group->mark_mutex protection in all the places. It
simplifies the code and gets rid of some ugly catches like calling
fsnotify_add_mark_locked() with mark->lock held (which cannot sleep only
because we hold a reference to another mark attached to the same inode).
