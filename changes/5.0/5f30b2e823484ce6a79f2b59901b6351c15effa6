livepatch: check kzalloc return values

kzalloc() return should always be checked - notably in example code
where this may be seen as reference. On failure of allocation in
livepatch_fix1_dummy_alloc() respectively dummy_alloc() previous
allocation is freed (thanks to Petr Mladek <pmladek@suse.com> for
catching this) and NULL returned.
