geneve: change NET_UDP_TUNNEL dependency to select

Due to the depends on NET_UDP_TUNNEL, at the moment it is impossible to
compile GENEVE if no other protocol depending on NET_UDP_TUNNEL is
selected.

Fix this changing the depends to a select, and drop NET_IP_TUNNEL from the
select list, as it already depends on NET_UDP_TUNNEL.
