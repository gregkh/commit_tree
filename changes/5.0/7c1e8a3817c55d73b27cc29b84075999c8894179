netlink: fixup regression in RTM_GETADDR

This commit fixes a regression in AF_INET/RTM_GETADDR and
AF_INET6/RTM_GETADDR.

Before this commit, the kernel would stop dumping addresses once the first
skb was full and end the stream with NLMSG_DONE(-EMSGSIZE). The error
shouldn't be sent back to netlink_dump so the callback is kept alive. The
userspace is expected to call back with a new empty skb.

Changes from V1:
 - The error is not handled in netlink_dump anymore but rather in
   inet_dump_ifaddr and inet6_dump_addr directly as suggested by
   David Ahern.

Fixes: d7e38611b81e ("net/ipv4: Put target net when address dump fails due to bad attributes")
Fixes: 242afaa6968c ("net/ipv6: Put target net when address dump fails due to bad attributes")
