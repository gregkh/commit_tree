drm/i915: Redefine some Whiskey Lake SKUs

commit 'b9be78531d27 ("drm/i915/whl: Introducing
Whiskey Lake platform")' introduced WHL by moving some
of CFL IDs here and using the Spec information of "U43" for
most of IDs what appeared to be GT3.

However when propagating the change to Mesa, Lionel noticed
that based on number of execution unities the classification
here seems at least strange.

So, let's move for now with the information we trust more:
the number of EUs. So we are able to propagate this change
across the stack without getting stuck forever.
