arm64/neon: add workaround for ambiguous C99 stdint.h types

In a way similar to ARM commit 09096f6a0ee2 ("ARM: 7822/1: add workaround
for ambiguous C99 stdint.h types"), this patch redefines the macros that
are used in stdint.h so its definitions of uint64_t and int64_t are
compatible with those of the kernel.
