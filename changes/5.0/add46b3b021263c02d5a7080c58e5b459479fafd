xfs: set buffer ops when repair probes for btree type

In xrep_findroot_block, we work out the btree type and correctness of a
given block by calling different btree verifiers on root block
candidates.  However, we leave the NULL b_ops while ->verify_read
validates the block, which means that if the verifier calls
xfs_buf_verifier_error it'll crash on the null b_ops.  Fix it to set
b_ops before calling the verifier and unsetting it if the verifier
fails.

Furthermore, improve the documentation around xfs_buf_ensure_ops, which
is the function that is responsible for cleaning up the b_ops state of
buffers that go through xrep_findroot_block but don't match anything.
