powerpc/pseries: Remove IOMMU API support for non-LPAR systems

The pci_dma_bus_setup_pSeries and pci_dma_dev_setup_pSeries hooks are
registered for the pseries platform which does not have FW_FEATURE_LPAR;
these would be pre-powernv platforms which we never supported PCI pass
through for anyway so remove it.
