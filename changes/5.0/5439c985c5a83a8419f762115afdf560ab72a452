module: Overwrite st_size instead of st_info

st_info is currently overwritten after relocation and used to store the
elf_type().  However, we're going to need it fix kallsyms on ARM's
Thumb-2 kernels, so preserve st_info and overwrite the st_size field
instead.  st_size is neither used by the module core nor by any
architecture.
