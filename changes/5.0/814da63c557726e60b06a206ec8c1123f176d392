net: hns3: use HNS3_NIC_STATE_INITED to indicate the initialization state of enet

Besides of module_init and module_exit, the process of reset will
also uninitialize and initialize the enet client. When reset process
fails with enet client uninitialized, the module_exit does not need
to uninitialize the enet client, otherwise it may cause double
uninitialization problem.

So we need the HNS3_NIC_STATE_INITED flag to indicate whether
the enet client is initialized.

Also HNS3_NIC_STATE_REINITING is previously unused, so change it to
HNS3_NIC_STATE_INITED.
