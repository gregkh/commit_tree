mlxsw: spectrum: acl_erp: Convert to use objagg for tracking ERPs

Currently the ERPs are tracked internally in a hashtable. Benefit from
the newly introduced objagg library and use it to track ERPs. At this
point, there is no nesting of objects done, as the delta_create callback
always returns -EOPNOTSUPP. On the way, add "mask" into ERP mask get and
set functions and struct names.
