spi: bcm2835: Fix book-keeping of DMA termination

If submission of a DMA TX transfer succeeds but submission of the
corresponding RX transfer does not, the BCM2835 SPI driver terminates
the TX transfer but neglects to reset the dma_pending flag to false.

Thus, if the next transfer uses interrupt mode (because it is shorter
than BCM2835_SPI_DMA_MIN_LENGTH) and runs into a timeout,
dmaengine_terminate_all() will be called both for TX (once more) and
for RX (which was never started in the first place).  Fix it.
