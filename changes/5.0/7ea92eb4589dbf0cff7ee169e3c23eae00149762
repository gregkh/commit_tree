scsi: lpfc: Implement GID_PT on Nameserver query to support faster failover

The switches seem to respond faster to GID_PT vs GID_FT NameServer
queries.  Add support for GID_PT to be used over GID_FT to enable
faster storage failover detection. Includes addition of new module
parameter to select between GID_PT and GID_FT (GID_FT is default).
