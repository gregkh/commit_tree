rcutorture: Recover from OOM during forward-progress tests

This commit causes the OOM handler to do rcu_barrier() calls and to
free up forward-progress callbacks in order to recover from OOM events.
The current test is terminated, but subsequent forward-progress tests can
proceed.  This allows a long test to result in multiple forward-progress
failures, greatly reducing the required testing time.
