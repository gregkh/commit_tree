perf pmu: Suppress potential format-truncation warning

Depending on which functions are inlined in util/pmu.c, the snprintf()
calls in perf_pmu__parse_{scale,unit,per_pkg,snapshot}() might trigger a
warning:

  util/pmu.c: In function 'pmu_aliases':
  util/pmu.c:178:31: error: '%s' directive output may be truncated writing up to 255 bytes into a region of size between 0 and 4095 [-Werror=format-truncation=]
    snprintf(path, PATH_MAX, "%s/%s.unit", dir, name);
                               ^~

I found this when trying to build perf from Linux 3.16 with gcc 8.
However I can reproduce the problem in mainline if I force
__perf_pmu__new_alias() to be inlined.

Suppress this by using scnprintf() as has been done elsewhere in perf.
