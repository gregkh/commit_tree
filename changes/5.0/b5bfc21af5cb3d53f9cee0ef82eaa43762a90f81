net: sfp: do not probe SFP module before we're attached

When we probe a SFP module, we expect to be able to call the upstream
device's module_insert() function so that the upstream link can be
configured.  However, when the upstream device is delayed, we currently
may end up probing the module before the upstream device is available,
and lose the module_insert() call.

Avoid this by holding off probing the module until the SFP bus is
properly connected to both the SFP socket driver and the upstream
driver.
