scsi: aic94xx: fix module loading

The aic94xx driver is currently failing to load with errors like

sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:03.0/0000:02:00.3/0000:07:02.0/revision'

Because the PCI code had recently added a file named 'revision' to every
PCI device.  Fix this by renaming the aic94xx revision file to
aic_revision.  This is safe to do for us because as far as I can tell,
there's nothing in userspace relying on the current aic94xx revision file
so it can be renamed without breaking anything.
