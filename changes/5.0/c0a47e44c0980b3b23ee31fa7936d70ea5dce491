geneve: should not call rt6_lookup() when ipv6 was disabled

When we add a new GENEVE device with IPv6 remote, checking only for
IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6) is not enough as we may disable IPv6 in the
kernel command line (ipv6.disable=1), and calling rt6_lookup() would
cause a NULL pointer dereference.

v2:
- don't mix declarations and code (reported by Stefano Brivio, Eric Dumazet)
- there's no need to use in6_dev_get() as we only need to check that
  idev exists (reported by David Ahern). This is under RTNL, so we can
  simply use __in6_dev_get() instead (Stefano, Eric).
