tools headers x86: Sync disabled-features.h

To silence the following tools/perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h

Picking up the changes in dae0a1059300 ("x86/cpufeatures, x86/fault:
Mark SMAP as disabled when configured out") that didn't entail any
functionality change in the tooling side.
