octeontx2-af: Restrict TL1 allocation and configuration

TL1 is the root node in the scheduling hierarchy and
it is a global resource with a limited number.

This patch introduces restriction and validation on
the allocation of the TL1 nodes for the effective resource
sharing across the AF consumers.

- Limit TL1 allocation to 2 per lmac.
  One could be for the normal link and one for IEEE802.3br
  express link (Express Send DMA).
  Effectively all the VF's of an RVU PF(lmac) share the two TL1 schqs.
- TL1 cannot be freed once allocated.
- Allow VF's to only apply default config to TL1 if not
  already applied. PF's can always overwrite the TL1 config.
- Consider NIX_AQ_INSTOP_WRITE while validating txschq
  when sq.ena is set.
