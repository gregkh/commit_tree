ARM: dts: imx: replace gpio-key,wakeup with wakeup-source property

Most of the legacy "gpio-key,wakeup" and "enable-sdio-wakeup" boolean
properties are already replaced with "wakeup-source". However few
occurrences of old property has popped up again, probably from the
remnants in downstream trees. Almost all of those were remove couple
of years back.

Replace the legacy properties with the unified "wakeup-source" property
introduced in the commit 700a38b27eef ("Input: gpio_keys - switch to using
generic device properties") and commit 0dbcdc0622ea ("mmc: core: enable
support for the standard "wakeup-source" property")
