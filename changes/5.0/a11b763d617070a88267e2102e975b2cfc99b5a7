powerpc: move macro definition from asm/systbl.h

Move the macro definition for compat_sys_sigsuspend from
asm/systbl.h to the file which it is getting included.

One of the patch in this patch series is generating uapi
header and syscall table files. In order to come up with
a common implimentation across all architecture, we need
to do this change.

This change will simplify the implementation of system
call table generation script and help to come up a common
implementation across all architecture.
