s390/qeth: fix use-after-free in error path

The error path in qeth_alloc_qdio_buffers() that takes care of
cleaning up the Output Queues is buggy. It first frees the queue, but
then calls qeth_clear_outq_buffers() with that very queue struct.

Make the call to qeth_clear_outq_buffers() part of the free action
(in the correct order), and while at it fix the naming of the helper.
