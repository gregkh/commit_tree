bpf: only adjust gso_size on bytestream protocols

bpf_skb_change_proto and bpf_skb_adjust_room change skb header length.
For GSO packets they adjust gso_size to maintain the same MTU.

The gso size can only be safely adjusted on bytestream protocols.
Commit d02f51cbcf12 ("bpf: fix bpf_skb_adjust_net/bpf_skb_proto_xlat
to deal with gso sctp skbs") excluded SKB_GSO_SCTP.

Since then type SKB_GSO_UDP_L4 has been added, whose contents are one
gso_size unit per datagram. Also exclude these.

Move from a blacklist to a whitelist check to future proof against
additional such new GSO types, e.g., for fraglist based GRO.
