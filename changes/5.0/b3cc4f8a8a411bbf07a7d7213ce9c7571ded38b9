selftests: pmtu: add explicit tests for PMTU exceptions cleanup

Add a couple of new tests, explicitly checking that the kernel
timely releases PMTU exceptions on related device removal.
This is mostly a regression test vs the issue fixed by
commit f5b51fe804ec ("ipv6: route: purge exception on removal")

Only 2 new test cases have been added, instead of extending all
the existing ones, because the reproducer requires executing
several commands and would slow down too much the tests otherwise.

v2 -> v3:
 - more cleanup, still from Stefano

v1 -> v2:
 - several script cleanups, as suggested by Stefano
