btrfs: Handle one more split-brain scenario during fsid change

This commit continues hardening the scanning code to handle cases where
power loss could have caused disks in a multi-disk filesystem to be
in inconsistent state. Namely handle the situation that can occur when
some of the disks in multi-disk fs have completed their fsid change i.e
they have METADATA_UUID incompat flag set, have cleared the
CHANGING_FSID_V2 flag and their fsid/metadata_uuid are different. At
the same time the other half of the disks will have their
fsid/metadata_uuid unchanged and will only have CHANGING_FSID_V2 flag.

This is handled by introducing code in the scan path which:

 a) Handles the case when a device with CHANGING_FSID_V2 flag is
 scanned and as a result btrfs_fs_devices is created with matching
 fsid/metdata_uuid. Subsequently, when a device with completed fsid
 change is scanned it will detect this via the new code in find_fsid
 i.e that such an fs_devices exist that fsid_change flag is set to true,
 it's metadata_uuid/fsid match and the metadata_uuid of the scanned
 device matches that of the fs_devices. In this case, it's important to
 note that the devices which has its fsid change completed will have a
 higher generation number than the device with FSID_CHANGING_V2 flag
 set, so its superblock block will be used during mount. To prevent an
 assertion triggering because the sb used for mounting will have
 differing fsid/metadata_uuid than the ones in the fs_devices struct
 also add code in device_list_add which overwrites the values in
 fs_devices.

 b) Alternatively we can end up with a device that completed its
 fsid change be scanned first which will create the respective
 btrfs_fs_devices struct with differing fsid/metadata_uuid. In this
 case when a device with FSID_CHANGING_V2 flag set is scanned it will
 call the newly added find_fsid_inprogress function which will return
 the correct fs_devices.
