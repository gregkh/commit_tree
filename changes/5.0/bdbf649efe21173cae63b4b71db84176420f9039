powerpc/powernv/ioda: Allocate indirect TCE levels of cached userspace addresses on demand

The powernv platform maintains 2 TCE tables for VFIO - a hardware TCE
table and a table with userspace addresses; the latter is used for
marking pages dirty when corresponging TCEs are unmapped from
the hardware table.

a68bd1267b72 ("powerpc/powernv/ioda: Allocate indirect TCE levels
on demand") enabled on-demand allocation of the hardware table,
however it missed the other table so it has still been fully allocated
at the boot time. This fixes the issue by allocating a single level,
just like we do for the hardware table.
