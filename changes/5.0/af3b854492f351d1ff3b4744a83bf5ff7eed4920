mm/page_alloc.c: allow error injection

Model call chain after should_failslab().  Likewise, we can now use a
kprobe to override the return value of should_fail_alloc_page() and inject
allocation failures into alloc_page*().

This will allow injecting allocation failures using the BCC tools even
without building kernel with CONFIG_FAIL_PAGE_ALLOC and booting it with a
fail_page_alloc= parameter, which incurs some overhead even when failures
are not being injected.  On the other hand, this patch adds an
unconditional call to should_fail_alloc_page() from page allocation
hotpath.  That overhead should be rather negligible with
CONFIG_FAIL_PAGE_ALLOC=n when there's no kprobe attached, though.
