drm/v3d: Add support for submitting jobs to the TFU.

The TFU can copy from raster, UIF, and SAND input images to UIF output
images, with optional mipmap generation.  This will certainly be
useful for media EGL image input, but is also useful immediately for
mipmap generation without bogging the V3D core down.

For now we only run the queue 1 job deep, and don't have any hang
recovery (though I don't think we should need it, with TFU).  Queuing
multiple jobs in the HW will require synchronizing the YUV coefficient
regs updates since they don't get FIFOed with the job.

v2: Change the ioctl to IOW instead of IOWR, always set COEF0, explain
    why TFU is AUTH, clarify the syncing docs, drop the unused TFU
    interrupt regs (you're expected to use the hub's), don't take
    &bo->base for NULL bos.
v3: Fix a little whitespace alignment (noticed by checkpatch), rebase
    on drm_sched_job_cleanup() changes.
