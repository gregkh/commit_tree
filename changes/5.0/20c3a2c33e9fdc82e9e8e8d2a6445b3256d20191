x86/speculation: Add support for STIBP always-on preferred mode

Different AMD processors may have different implementations of STIBP.
When STIBP is conditionally enabled, some implementations would benefit
from having STIBP always on instead of toggling the STIBP bit through MSR
writes. This preference is advertised through a CPUID feature bit.

When conditional STIBP support is requested at boot and the CPU advertises
STIBP always-on mode as preferred, switch to STIBP "on" support. To show
that this transition has occurred, create a new spectre_v2_user_mitigation
value and a new spectre_v2_user_strings message. The new mitigation value
is used in spectre_v2_user_select_mitigation() to print the new mitigation
message as well as to return a new string from stibp_state().
