ARM: dts: mmp2: Add SSP controllers

Despite Marvel keeps their base addresses secret there's a good chance
they're actually correct.

SSP1 and SSP3 bases were taken from OLPC 1.75: OpenFirmware and kernel
respectively. SSP2 and SSP4 addresses are from James Cameron who actually
has a copy of the data sheet.
