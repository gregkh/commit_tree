PCI / ACPI: Identify untrusted PCI devices

A malicious PCI device may use DMA to attack the system. An external
Thunderbolt port is a convenient point to attach such a device. The OS
may use IOMMU to defend against DMA attacks.

Some BIOSes mark these externally facing root ports with this
ACPI _DSD [1]:

  Name (_DSD, Package () {
      ToUUID ("efcc06cc-73ac-4bc3-bff0-76143807c389"),
      Package () {
          Package () {"ExternalFacingPort", 1},
	  Package () {"UID", 0 }
      }
  })

If we find such a root port, mark it and all its children as untrusted.
The rest of the OS may use this information to enable DMA protection
against malicious devices. For instance the device may be put behind an
IOMMU to keep it from accessing memory outside of what the driver has
allocated for it.

While at it, add a comment on top of prp_guids array explaining the
possible caveat resulting when these GUIDs are treated equivalent.
