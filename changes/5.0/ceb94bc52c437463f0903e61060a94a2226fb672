usb: gadget: udc: renesas_usb3: add a safety connection way for forced_b_device

This patch adds a safety connection way for "forced_b_device" with
"workaround_for_vbus" like below:

< Example for R-Car E3 Ebisu >
 # modprobe <any usb gadget driver>
 # echo 1 > /sys/kernel/debug/ee020000.usb/b_device
 (connect a usb cable to host side.)
 # echo 2 > /sys/kernel/debug/ee020000.usb/b_device

Previous code should have connected a usb cable before the "b_device"
is set to 1 on the Ebisu board. However, if xHCI driver on the board
is probed, it causes some troubles:
 - Conflicts USB VBUS/signals between the board and another host.
 - "Cannot enable. Maybe the USB cable is bad?" might happen on
   both the board and another host with a usb hub.
 - Cannot enumerate a usb gadget correctly because an interruption
   of VBUS change happens unexpectedly.
