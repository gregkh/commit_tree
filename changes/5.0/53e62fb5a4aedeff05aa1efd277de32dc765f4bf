btrfs: dev-replace: add explicit check for replace result "no error"

We recast the replace return status
BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_RESULT_SCRUB_INPROGRESS to 0, to indicate no
error.
And since BTRFS_IOCTL_DEV_REPLACE_RESULT_NO_ERROR should also return 0,
which is also declared as 0, so we just return. Instead add it to the if
statement so that there is enough clarity while reading the code.
