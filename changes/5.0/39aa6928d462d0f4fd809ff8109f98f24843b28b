xfrm: policy: fix netlink/pf_key policy lookups

Colin Ian King says:
 Static analysis with CoverityScan found a potential issue [..]
 It seems that pointer pol is set to NULL and then a check to see if it
 is non-null is used to set pol to tmp; howeverm this check is always
 going to be false because pol is always NULL.

Fix this and update test script to catch this.  Updated script only:
./xfrm_policy.sh ; echo $?

FAIL: ip -net ns3 xfrm policy get src 10.0.1.0/24 dst 10.0.2.0/24 dir out
