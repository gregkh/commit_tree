selftests/bpf: install with_tunnels.sh for test_flow_dissector.sh

test_flow_dissector.sh depends on both with_addr.sh and with_tunnels.sh
However, we install only with_addr.sh.

Add with_tunnels.sh to TEST_PROGS_EXTENDED to make sure it gets
installed as well.

Tested with: make TARGETS=bpf install INSTALL_PATH=$PWD/x
