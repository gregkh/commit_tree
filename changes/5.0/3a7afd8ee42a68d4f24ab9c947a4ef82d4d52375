nvme-pci: remove the CQ lock for interrupt driven queues

Now that we can't poll regular, interrupt driven I/O queues there
is almost nothing that can race with an interrupt.  The only
possible other contexts polling a CQ are the error handler and
queue shutdown, and both are so far off in the slow path that
we can simply use the big hammer of disabling interrupts.

With that we can stop taking the cq_lock for normal queues.
