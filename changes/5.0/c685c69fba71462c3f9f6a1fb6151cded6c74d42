ixgbe: don't do any AF_XDP zero-copy transmit if netif is not OK

An issue has been found while testing zero-copy XDP that
causes a reset to be triggered. As it takes some time to
turn the carrier on after setting zc, and we already
start trying to transmit some packets, watchdog considers
this as an erroneous state and triggers a reset.

Don't do any work if netif carrier is not OK.
