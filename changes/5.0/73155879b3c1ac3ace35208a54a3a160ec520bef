ipv6: Fix dump of specific table with strict checking

Dump of a specific table with strict checking enabled is looping. The
problem is that the end of the table dump is not marked in the cb. When
dumping a specific table, cb args 0 and 1 are not used (they are the hash
index and entry with an hash table index when dumping all tables). Re-use
args[0] to hold a 'done' flag for the specific table dump.
