arm64: dts: meson: Fix IRQ trigger type for macirq

A long running stress test on a custom board shipping an AXG SoCs and a
Realtek RTL8211F PHY revealed that after a few hours the connection
speed would drop drastically, from ~1000Mbps to ~3Mbps. At the same time
the 'macirq' (eth0) IRQ would stop being triggered at all and as
consequence the GMAC IRQs never ACKed.

After a painful investigation the problem seemed to be due to a wrong
defined IRQ type for the GMAC IRQ that should be LEVEL_HIGH instead of
EDGE_RISING.

The change in the macirq IRQ type also solved another long standing
issue affecting this SoC/PHY where EEE was causing the network
connection to die after stressing it with iperf3 (even though much
sooner). It's now possible to remove the 'eee-broken-1000t' quirk as
well.
