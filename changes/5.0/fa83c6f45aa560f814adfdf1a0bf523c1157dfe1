clocksource/drivers/meson6_timer: Implement the ARM delay timer

Implement an ARM delay timer to be used for udelay(). This allows us to
skip the delay loop calibration at boot.

With this patch udelay() is now independent of CPU frequency changes.
This is a good thing on Meson8, Meson8b and Meson8m2 because changing
the CPU frequency requires running the CPU clock off the XTAL while
changing the PLL or it's dividers. After changing the CPU clocks we need
to wait a few usecs for the clock to become stable. So having an
udelay() implementation that doesn't depend on the CPU frequency is
beneficial.
