mlxsw: spectrum_router: Introduce emulated VLAN RIFs

Router interfaces (RIFs) constructed on top of VLAN-aware bridges are of
"VLAN" type, whereas RIFs constructed on top of VLAN-unaware bridges of
"FID" type.

In other words, the RIF type is derived from the underlying FID type.
VLAN RIFs are used on top of 802.1Q FIDs, whereas FID RIFs are used on
top of 802.1D FIDs.

Since the previous patch emulated 802.1Q FIDs using 802.1D FIDs, this
patch emulates VLAN RIFs using FID RIFs.
