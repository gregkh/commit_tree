ALSA: x86: Fix runtime PM for hdmi-lpe-audio

Commit 46e831abe864 ("drm/i915/lpe: Mark LPE audio runtime pm as
"no callbacks"") broke runtime PM with lpe audio. We can no longer
runtime suspend the GPU since the sysfs  power/control for the
lpe-audio device no longer exists and the device is considered
always active. We can fix this by not marking the device as
active.
