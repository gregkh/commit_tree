drm/i915: Switch LSPCON to PCON mode if it's in LS mode

We no longer change LSPCON into PCON mode if it boots up in
LS mode. This was broken by some code shuffling in
commit 96e35598cead ("drm/i915: Check LSPCON vendor OUI").

I actually can't see a reason why that code shuffling had
to be done. The commit msg notes it but doesn't justify it
in any way. But I guess we'll keep the code in its current
place anyway and just make the "switch to PCON mode" part
effective once again.
