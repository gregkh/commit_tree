net: sched: red: delay destroying child qdisc on replace

Move destroying of the old child qdisc outside of the sch_tree_lock()
section.  This should improve the software qdisc replace but is even
more important for offloads.  Firstly calling offloads under a spin
lock is best avoided.  Secondly the destroy event of existing child
would have been sent to the offload device before the replace, causing
confusion.
