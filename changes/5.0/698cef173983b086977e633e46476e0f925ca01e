block: cover another queue enter recursion via BIO_QUEUE_ENTERED

Except for blk_queue_split(), bio_split() is used for splitting bio too,
then the remained bio is often resubmit to queue via generic_make_request().
So the same queue enter recursion exits in this case too. Unfortunatley
commit cd4a4ae4683dc2 doesn't help this case.

This patch covers the above case by setting BIO_QUEUE_ENTERED before calling
q->make_request_fn.

In theory the per-bio flag is used to simulate one stack variable, it is
just fine to clear it after q->make_request_fn is returned. Especially
the same bio can't be submitted from another context.
