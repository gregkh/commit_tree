media: rc: add driver for Xbox DVD Movie Playback Kit

The Xbox DVD Movie Playback Kit is a USB dongle with an IR remote for the
Original Xbox.

Historically it has been supported by the out-of-tree lirc_xbox driver,
but this one has fallen out of favour and was just dropped from popular
Kodi (formerly XBMC) distributions.

This driver is heavily based on the ati_remote driver where all the
boilerplate was taken from - I was mostly just removing code.
