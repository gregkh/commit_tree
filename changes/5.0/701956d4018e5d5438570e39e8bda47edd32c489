char/mwave: fix potential Spectre v1 vulnerability

ipcnum is indirectly controlled by user-space, hence leading to
a potential exploitation of the Spectre variant 1 vulnerability.

This issue was detected with the help of Smatch:

drivers/char/mwave/mwavedd.c:299 mwave_ioctl() warn: potential spectre issue 'pDrvData->IPCs' [w] (local cap)

Fix this by sanitizing ipcnum before using it to index pDrvData->IPCs.

Notice that given that speculation windows are large, the policy is
to kill the speculation on the first load and not worry if it can be
completed with a dependent load/store [1].
