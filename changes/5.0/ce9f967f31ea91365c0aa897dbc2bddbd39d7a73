btrfs: use EXPORT_FOR_TESTS for conditionally exported functions

Several functions in BTRFS are only used inside the source file they are
declared if CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_RUN_SANITY_TESTS is not defined. However if
CONFIG_BTRFS_FS_RUN_SANITY_TESTS is defined these functions are shared
with the unit tests code.

Before the introduction of the EXPORT_FOR_TESTS macro, these functions
could not be declared as static and the compiler had a harder task when
optimizing and inlining them.

As we have EXPORT_FOR_TESTS now, use it where appropriate to support the
compiler.
