hwmon: (ina3221) Make sure data is ready before reading

The data might need some time to get ready after channel enabling,
although the data register is always readable. The CVRF bit is to
indicate that data conversion is finished, so polling the CVRF bit
before data reading could ensure the result being valid.

An alternative way could be to wait for expected time between the
channel enabling and the data reading. And this could avoid extra
I2C communications. However, INA3221 seemly takes longer time than
what's stated in the datasheet. Test results show that sometimes
it couldn't finish data conversion in time.

So this patch plays safe by adding a CVRF polling to make sure the
data register is updated with the new data.
