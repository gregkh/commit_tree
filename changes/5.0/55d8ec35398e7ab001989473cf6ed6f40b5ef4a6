lightnvm: pblk: support packed metadata

pblk performs recovery of open lines by storing the LBA in the per LBA
metadata field. Recovery therefore only works for drives that has this
field.

This patch adds support for packed metadata, which store l2p mapping
for open lines in last sector of every write unit and enables drives
without per IO metadata to recover open lines.

After this patch, drives with OOB size <16B will use packed metadata
and metadata size larger than16B will continue to use the device per
IO metadata.
