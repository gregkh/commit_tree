bpf: rename *_info_cnt to nr_*_info in bpf_prog_info

In uapi bpf.h, currently we have the following fields in
the struct bpf_prog_info:
	__u32 func_info_cnt;
	__u32 line_info_cnt;
	__u32 jited_line_info_cnt;
The above field names "func_info_cnt" and "line_info_cnt"
also appear in union bpf_attr for program loading.

The original intention is to keep the names the same
between bpf_prog_info and bpf_attr
so it will imply what we returned to user space will be
the same as what the user space passed to the kernel.

Such a naming convention in bpf_prog_info is not consistent
with other fields like:
        __u32 nr_jited_ksyms;
        __u32 nr_jited_func_lens;

This patch made this adjustment so in bpf_prog_info
newly introduced *_info_cnt becomes nr_*_info.
