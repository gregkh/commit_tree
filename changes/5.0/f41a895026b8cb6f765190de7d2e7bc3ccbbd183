drm/amd/display: Guard against null stream_state in set_crc_source

[Why]

The igt@kms_plane@pixel-format-pipe tests can create a sequence where
stream_state is NULL during amdgpu_dm_crtc_set_crc_source which results
in a null pointer dereference.

[How]

Guard against stream_state being NULL before accessing its fields. This
doesn't fix the root cause of the issue so a DRM_ERROR is generated
to still fail the tests.
