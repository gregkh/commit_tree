rtc: sun6i: Add support for different variants

Amongst the Allwinner SoCs that have seen some kind of coverage by the
linux-sunxi community, whether it be mainline Linux or U-boot support,
or just available datasheets, most newer chips use the RTC design first
seen in the A31 (sun6i).

Overall there have been some minor differences. This patch covers the
following:

  - average clock rate of the internal RC oscillator
    + presence of fixed and adjustable prescaler for this clock
  - availability of an external (to the SoC) clock output

One major difference regarding the H6 is the 24 MHz crystal is now
routed through the RTC, as a digitally compensated oscillator (DCXO).
This is not covered in this patch and will be supported later.

Other differences are either unrelated to RTC or clock functionality,
such as boot or crypto related registers, or the driver simply doesn't
use the feature in question. One example of the latter is the
calibration function for the RC oscillator. We consider this clock to
be very bad and avoid using it.
