usb: renesas_usbhs: add support for RZ/G2E

HS-USB found in RZ/G2E (a.k.a. r8a774c0) is very similar to the
one found in R-Car E3 (a.k.a. r8a77990), as it needs to release
the PLL reset by the UGCTRL register like R-Car E3, therefore add
r8a774c0 support in a similar fashion to what was done for the
r8a77990.
