dm: don't use bio_trim() afterall

bio_trim() has an early return, which makes it _not_ idempotent, if the
offset is 0 and the bio's bi_size already matches the requested size.
Prior to DM, all users of bio_trim() were fine with this.  But DM has
exposed the fact that bio_trim()'s early return is incompatible with a
cloned bio whose integrity payload must be trimmed via
bio_integrity_trim().

Fix this by reverting DM back to doing the equivalent of bio_trim() but
in an idempotent manner (so bio_integrity_trim is always performed).

Follow-on work is needed to assess what benefit bio_trim()'s early
return is providing to its existing callers.
