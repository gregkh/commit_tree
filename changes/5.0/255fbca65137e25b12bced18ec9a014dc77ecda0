nfsd: Return EPERM, not EACCES, in some SETATTR cases

As the man(2) page for utime/utimes states, EPERM is returned when the
second parameter of utime or utimes is not NULL, the caller's effective UID
does not match the owner of the file, and the caller is not privileged.

However, in a NFS directory mounted from knfsd, it will return EACCES
(from nfsd_setattr-> fh_verify->nfsd_permission).  This patch fixes
that.
