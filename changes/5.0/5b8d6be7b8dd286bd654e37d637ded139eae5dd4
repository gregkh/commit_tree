powerpc: Rework btext_find_display to use of_stdout and device_type helpers

Remove directly accessing device_node.type pointer and use the
accessors instead. This will eventually allow removing the type
pointer.

In the process, the of_stdout pointer can be used instead of finding
the stdout node again.
