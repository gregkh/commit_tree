soc: renesas: r8a774c0-sysc: Fix initialization order of 3DG-{A,B}

The workaround for the wrong hierarchy of the 3DG-{A,B} power domains on
RZ/G2E ES1.0 corrected the parent domains. However, the 3DG-{A,B} power
domains were still initialized and powered in the wrong order, causing
3DG operation to fail.

Fix this by changing the order in the table at runtime, when running on
an affected SoC.

This work is based on the work done by Geert for R-Car E3.
