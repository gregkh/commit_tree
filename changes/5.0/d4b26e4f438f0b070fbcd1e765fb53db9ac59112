drm/i915: add a common connector type independent destroy hook

Almost all of the connector destroy functions do the same thing. The
differences are in the edid, detect_edid and panel cleanups, but those
are safely NULL when not initialized. Roll out a common connector
destroy hook.

Inspired by commit bc3213c44415 ("drm/i915: Drop the eDP check from
intel_dp_connector_destroy()").
