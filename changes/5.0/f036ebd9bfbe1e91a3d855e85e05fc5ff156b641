nfp: bpf: fix ALU32 high bits clearance bug

NFP BPF JIT compiler is doing a couple of small optimizations when jitting
ALU imm instructions, some of these optimizations could save code-gen, for
example:

  A & -1 =  A
  A |  0 =  A
  A ^  0 =  A

However, for ALU32, high 32-bit of the 64-bit register should still be
cleared according to ISA semantics.
