scripts/decodecode: set ARCH when running natively on arm/arm64

When running decodecode natively on arm64, ARCH is likely not to be set,
and we end-up with .4byte instead of .inst when generating the
disassembly.

Similar effects would occur if running natively on a 32bit ARM platform,
although that's even less popular.

A simple workaround is to populate ARCH when it is not set and that we're
running on an arm/arm64 system.
