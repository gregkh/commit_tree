tun: align write-heavy flow entry members to a cache line

tun flow entry 'updated' fields are written when receive
every packet. Thus if a flow is receiving packets from a
particular flow entry, it'll cause false-sharing with
all the other who has looked it up, so move it in its own
cache line

and update 'queue_index' and 'update' field only when
they are changed to reduce the cache false-sharing.
