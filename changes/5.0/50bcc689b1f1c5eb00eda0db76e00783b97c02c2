drm/msm: dpu: Make legacy cursor updates asynchronous

This patch sprinkles a few async/legacy_cursor_update checks
through commit to ensure that cursor updates aren't blocked on vsync.
There are 2 main components to this, the first is that we don't want to
wait_for_commit_done in msm_atomic  before returning from atomic_complete.
The second is that in dpu we don't want to wait for frame_done events when
updating the cursor.

Changes in v2:
- None
