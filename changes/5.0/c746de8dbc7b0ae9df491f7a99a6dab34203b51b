ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Harden DSP detection with PCI class/subclass info

The existing PPCAP and GCAP fields cannot be used reliably to
determine if the DSP is enabled by the BIOS. Instead rely on the
class/subclass information to find out if this driver can run or
not. The values in the code don't seem to be documented in publicly
available documents but are part of recommendations made to BIOS
writers and have been verified to be accurate on a number of
platforms.
