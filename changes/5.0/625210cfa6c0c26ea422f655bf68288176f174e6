x86/Kconfig: Select PCI_LOCKLESS_CONFIG if PCI is enabled

After commit

  5d32a66541c4 ("PCI/ACPI: Allow ACPI to be built without CONFIG_PCI set")

dependencies on CONFIG_PCI that previously were satisfied implicitly
through dependencies on CONFIG_ACPI have to be specified directly.

PCI_LOCKLESS_CONFIG depends on PCI but this dependency has not been
mentioned in the Kconfig so add an explicit dependency here and fix

  WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for PCI_LOCKLESS_CONFIG
    Depends on [n]: PCI [=n]
    Selected by [y]:
    - X86 [=y]
