<0>[  531.960431] drv_self-4806    7.... 527402624us : execlists_reset_finish: rcs0

we are missing the execlists_submission_tasklet() invocation before the
execlists_reset_fini() implying that either the queue is empty, or we
failed to schedule and run the tasklet on finish. Add an assert so we
are sure that on unsubmitting the incomplete request after reset, the
queue is indeed populated.
