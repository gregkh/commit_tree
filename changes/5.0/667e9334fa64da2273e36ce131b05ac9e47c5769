ASoC: tlv320aic32x4: Kernel OOPS while entering DAPM standby mode

During the bootup of the kernel, the DAPM bias level is in the OFF
state. As soon as the DAPM framework kicks in it pushes the codec
into STANDBY state.

The probe function doesn't prepare the clock, and STANDBY state
does a clk_disable_unprepare() without checking the previous state.
This leads to an OOPS.

Not transitioning from an OFF state to the STANDBY state fixes the
problem.
