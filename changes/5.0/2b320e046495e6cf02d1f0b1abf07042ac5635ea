ASoC: simple-card-utils: fix build warning without CONFIG_OF

When CONFIG_OF is disabled, of_graph_parse_endpoint() does not
initialize 'info', and gcc can see that:

sound/soc/generic/simple-card-utils.c: In function 'asoc_simple_card_parse_graph_dai':
sound/soc/generic/simple-card-utils.c:284:13: error: 'info.port' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

It's probably best to check the return code anyway, and that also
takes care of the warning.
