mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Handle SWITCHDEV_PORT_OBJ_ADD/_DEL

Following patches will change the way of distributing port object
changes from a switchdev operation to a switchdev notifier. The
switchdev code currently recursively descends through layers of lower
devices, eventually calling the op on a front-panel port device. The
notifier will instead be sent referencing the bridge port device, which
may be a stacking device that's one of front-panel ports uppers, or a
completely unrelated device.

To handle SWITCHDEV_PORT_OBJ_ADD and _DEL, subscribe to the blocking
notifier chain. Dispatch to mlxsw_sp_port_obj_add() resp. _del() to
maintain the behavior that the switchdev operation based code currently
has. Defer to switchdev_handle_port_obj_add() / _del() to handle the
recursive descend, because mlxsw supports a number of upper types.
