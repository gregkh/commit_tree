mmc: sunxi: Filter out unsupported modes declared in the device tree

The MMC device tree bindings include properties used to signal various
signalling speed modes. Until now the sunxi driver was accepting them
without any further filtering, while the sunxi device trees were not
actually using them.

Since some of the H5 boards can not run at higher speed modes stably,
we are resorting to declaring the higher speed modes per-board.

Regardless, having boards declare modes and blindly following them,
even without proper support in the driver, is generally a bad thing.

Filter out all unsupported modes from the capabilities mask after
the device tree properties have been parsed.
