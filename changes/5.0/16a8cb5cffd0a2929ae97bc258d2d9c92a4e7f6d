bpf: do not pass netdev to translate() and prepare() offload callbacks

The kernel functions to prepare verifier and translate for offloaded
program retrieve "offload" from "prog", and "netdev" from "offload".
Then both "prog" and "netdev" are passed to the callbacks.

Simplify this by letting the drivers retrieve the net device themselves
from the offload object attached to prog - if they need it at all. There
is currently no need to pass the netdev as an argument to those
functions.
