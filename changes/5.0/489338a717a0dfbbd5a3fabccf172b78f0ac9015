perf tests evsel-tp-sched: Fix bitwise operator

Notice that the use of the bitwise OR operator '|' always leads to true
in this particular case, which seems a bit suspicious due to the context
in which this expression is being used.

Fix this by using bitwise AND operator '&' instead.

This bug was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
