net/mlx4_core: Add masking for a few queries on HCA caps

Driver reads the query HCA capabilities without the corresponding masks.
Without the correct masks, the base addresses of the queues are
unaligned.  In addition some reserved bits were wrongly read.  Using the
correct masks, ensures alignment of the base addresses and allows future
firmware versions safe use of the reserved bits.
