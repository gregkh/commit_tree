doc: Remove rcu_preempt_state reference in stallwarn

Consolidation of RCU-bh, RCU-preempt, and RCU-sched into one RCU flavor
to rule them all resulted in the removal of rcu_preempt_state.  However,
stallwarn.txt still mentions rcu_preempt_state.  This commit therefore
Updates stallwarn documentation accordingly.
