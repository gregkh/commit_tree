crypto: arm/nhpoly1305 - add NEON-accelerated NHPoly1305

Add an ARM NEON implementation of NHPoly1305, an ε-almost-∆-universal
hash function used in the Adiantum encryption mode.  For now, only the
NH portion is actually NEON-accelerated; the Poly1305 part is less
performance-critical so is just implemented in C.
