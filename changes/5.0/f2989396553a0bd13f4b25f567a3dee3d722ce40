acpi/nfit, libnvdimm: Introduce nvdimm_security_ops

Some NVDIMMs, like the ones defined by the NVDIMM_FAMILY_INTEL command
set, expose a security capability to lock the DIMMs at poweroff and
require a passphrase to unlock them. The security model is derived from
ATA security. In anticipation of other DIMMs implementing a similar
scheme, and to abstract the core security implementation away from the
device-specific details, introduce nvdimm_security_ops.

Initially only a status retrieval operation, ->state(), is defined,
along with the base infrastructure and definitions for future
operations.
