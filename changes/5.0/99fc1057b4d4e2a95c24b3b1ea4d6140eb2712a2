ice: Call pci_disable_sriov before stopping queues for VF

Previous to this commit the driver was immediately stopping Tx/Rx
queues when doing the following "echo 0 > sriov_numvfs" and then it was
calling pci_disable_sriov if the VFs are not assigned. This was causing
the VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES to fail because it was trying to stop
the queues for a second time.

Fix this by calling pci_disable_sriov before stopping the Tx/Rx queues.
This allows the VIRTCHNL_OP_DISABLE_QUEUES to get processed before the
driver tries to stop the Rx/Tx queues in ice_free_vfs.
