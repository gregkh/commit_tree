block: move queues types to the block layer

Having another indirect all in the fast path doesn't really help
in our post-spectre world.  Also having too many queue type is just
going to create confusion, so I'd rather manage them centrally.

Note that the queue type naming and ordering changes a bit - the
first index now is the default queue for everything not explicitly
marked, the optional ones are read and poll queues.
