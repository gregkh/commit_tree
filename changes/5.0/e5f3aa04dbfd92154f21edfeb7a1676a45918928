net/smc: use device link provided in qp_context

The device field of the IB event structure does not always point to the
SMC IB device. Load the pointer from the qp_context which is always
provided to smc_ib_qp_event_handler() in the priv field. And for qp
events the affected port is given in the qp structure of the ibevent,
derive it from there.
