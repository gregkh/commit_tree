media: uvcvideo: Refactor URB descriptors

We currently store three separate arrays for each URB reference we hold.

Objectify the data needed to track URBs into a single uvc_urb structure,
allowing better object management and tracking of the URB.

All accesses to the data pointers through stream, are converted to use a
uvc_urb pointer for consistency.
