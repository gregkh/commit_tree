x86/hyper-v: Stop caring about EOI for direct stimers

Turns out we over-engineered Direct Mode for stimers a bit: unlike
traditional stimers where we may want to try to re-inject the message upon
EOI, Direct Mode stimers just set the irq in APIC and kvm_apic_set_irq()
fails only when APIC is disabled (see APIC_DM_FIXED case in
__apic_accept_irq()). Remove the redundant part.
