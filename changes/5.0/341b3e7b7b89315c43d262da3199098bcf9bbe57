bpf: call verify_insn from its callback in struct bpf_offload_dev

We intend to remove the dev_ops in struct bpf_prog_offload, and to only
keep the ops in struct bpf_offload_dev instead, which is accessible from
more locations for passing function pointers.

But dev_ops is used for calling the verify_insn hook. Switch to the
newly added ops in struct bpf_prog_offload instead.

To avoid table lookups for each eBPF instruction to verify, we remember
the offdev attached to a netdev and modify bpf_offload_find_netdev() to
avoid performing more than once a lookup for a given offload object.
