mmc: atmel-mci: do not assume idle after atmci_request_end

On our AT91SAM9260 board we use the same sdio bus for wifi and for the
sd card slot. This caused the atmel-mci to give the following splat on
the serial console:

This is:
  WARN_ON(host->cmd);

This was fixed on our board by letting atmci_request_end determine what
state we are in. Instead of unconditionally setting it to STATE_IDLE on
STATE_END_REQUEST.
