parisc: Remap hugepage-aligned pages in set_kernel_text_rw()

The alternative coding patch for parisc in kernel 4.20 broke booting
machines with PA8500-PA8700 CPUs. The problem is, that for such machines
the parisc kernel automatically utilizes huge pages to access kernel
text code, but the set_kernel_text_rw() function, which is used shortly
before applying any alternative patches, didn't used the correctly
hugepage-aligned addresses to remap the kernel text read-writeable.
