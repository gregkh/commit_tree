rcutorture: Break up too-long rcu_torture_fwd_prog() function

This commit splits rcu_torture_fwd_prog_nr() and rcu_torture_fwd_prog_cr()
functions out of rcu_torture_fwd_prog() in order to reduce indentation
pain and because rcu_torture_fwd_prog() was getting a bit too long.
In addition, this will enable easier conditional execution of the
rcu_torture_fwd_prog_cr() function, which can give false-positive
failures in some NO_HZ_FULL configurations due to overloading the
housekeeping CPUs.
