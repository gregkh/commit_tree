net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Default ports 9/10 6390X CMODE to 1000BaseX

The 6390X family has 8 SERDES interfaces. This allows ports 9 and 10
to support up to 10Gbps using 4 SERDES interfaces. However, when lower
speeds are used, which need fewer SERDES interfaces, the unused SERDES
interfaces can be used by ports 2-8.

The hardware defaults to ports 9 and 10 having all 4 SERDES interfaces
assigned to them. This only gets changed when the interface is
configured after what the SFP supports has been determined, or the 10G
PHY completes auto-neg.

For hardware designs which limit ports 9 and 10 to one or two SERDES
interfaces, and place SFPs on the lower interfaces, this is too
late. Those ports with SFP should not wait until ports 9/10 are up in
order to get access to the SERDES interface. So change the default
configuration when the driver is initialised. Configure ports 9 and 10
to 1000BaseX, so they use a single SERDES interface, freeing up the
others. They can steal them back if they need them.
