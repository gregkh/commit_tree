torture: Remove unnecessary "ret" variables

Remove return variables (declared as "ret") in cases where,
depending on whether a condition evaluates as true, the result of a
function call can be immediately returned instead of storing the result in
the return variable. When the condition evaluates as false, the constant
initially stored in the return variable at declaration is returned instead.
