omap2fb: Fix stack memory disclosure

Using [1] for static analysis I found that the OMAPFB_QUERY_PLANE,
OMAPFB_GET_COLOR_KEY, OMAPFB_GET_DISPLAY_INFO, and OMAPFB_GET_VRAM_INFO
cases could all leak uninitialized stack memory--either due to
uninitialized padding or 'reserved' fields.

Fix them by clearing the shared union used to store copied out data.
