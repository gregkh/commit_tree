batman-adv: Add inconsistent multicast netlink dump detection

The netlink dump functionality transfers a large number of entries from the
kernel to userspace. It is rather likely that the transfer has to
interrupted and later continued. During that time, it can happen that
either new entries are added or removed. The userspace could than either
receive some entries multiple times or miss entries.

Commit 670dc2833d14 ("netlink: advertise incomplete dumps") introduced a
mechanism to inform userspace about this problem. Userspace can then decide
whether it is necessary or not to retry dumping the information again.

The netlink dump functions have to be switched to exclusive locks to avoid
changes while the current message is prepared. The already existing
generation sequence counter from the hash helper can be used for this
simple hash.
