audit: Drop all unused chunk nodes during deletion

When deleting chunk from a tree, drop all unused nodes in a chunk
instead of just the one used by the tree. This gets rid of possibly
lingering unused nodes (created due to fallback path in untag_chunk())
and also removes some special cases and will allow us to simplify
locking in untag_chunk().
