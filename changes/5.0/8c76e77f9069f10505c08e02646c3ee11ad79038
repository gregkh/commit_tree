tap: call skb_probe_transport_header after setting skb->dev

The BPF flow dissector expects either skb->sk or skb->dev set on
all skbs. Delay flow dissection until after skb->dev is set.

This requires calling from within an rcu read-side critical section.
That is fine, see also the call from tun_xdp_one.

Fixes: d0e13a1488ad ("flow_dissector: lookup netns by skb->sk if skb->dev is NULL")
