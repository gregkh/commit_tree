vt: make vt_console_print() compatible with the unicode screen buffer

When kernel messages are printed to the console, they appear blank on
the unicode screen. This is because vt_console_print() is lacking a call
to vc_uniscr_putc(). However the later function assumes vc->vc_x is
always up to date when called, which is not the case here as
vt_console_print() uses it to mark the beginning of the display update.

This patch reworks (and simplifies) vt_console_print() so that vc->vc_x
is always valid and keeps the start of display update in a local variable
instead, which finally allows for adding the missing vc_uniscr_putc()
call.
