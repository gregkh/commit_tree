staging: rtlwifi: Remove function that only returns zero

Because the odm_sq_process_patch_rt_cid_819x_lenovo function is only called
to return zero, remove the unnecessary function and change the section that
calls it. Issues found by Coccinelle's semantic patch results for
returnvar.cocci and checkpatch.pl.
