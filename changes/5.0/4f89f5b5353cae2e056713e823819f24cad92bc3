vxlan: Add vxlan_fdb_replay()

When a VXLAN device becomes relevant to a driver (such as when it is
attached to an offloaded bridge), the driver will generally need to walk
the existing FDB entries and offload them.

Add a function vxlan_fdb_replay() to call a given notifier block for
each FDB entry with a given VNI.
