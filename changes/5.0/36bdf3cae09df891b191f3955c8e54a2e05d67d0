binderfs: reserve devices for initial mount

The binderfs instance in the initial ipc namespace will always have a
reserve of 4 binder devices unless explicitly capped by specifying a lower
value via the "max" mount option.
This ensures when binder devices are removed (on accident or on purpose)
they can always be recreated without risking that all minor numbers have
already been used up.
