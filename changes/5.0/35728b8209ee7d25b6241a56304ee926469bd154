time: Add SPDX license identifiers

Update the time(r) core files files with the correct SPDX license
identifier based on the license text in the file itself. The SPDX
identifier is a legally binding shorthand, which can be used instead of the
full boiler plate text.

This work is based on a script and data from Philippe Ombredanne, Kate
Stewart and myself. The data has been created with two independent license
scanners and manual inspection.

The following files do not contain any direct license information and have
been omitted from the big initial SPDX changes:

  timeconst.bc: The .bc files were not touched
  time.c, timer.c, timekeeping.c: Licence was deduced from EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL

As those files do not contain direct license references they fall under the
project license, i.e. GPL V2 only.
