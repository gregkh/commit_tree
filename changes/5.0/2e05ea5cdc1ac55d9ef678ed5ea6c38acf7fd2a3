dma-mapping: implement dma_map_single_attrs using dma_map_page_attrs

And also switch the way we implement the unmap side around to stay
consistent.  This ensures dma-debug works again because it records which
function we used for mapping to ensure it is also used for unmapping,
and also reduces further code duplication.  Last but not least this
also officially allows calling dma_sync_single_* for mappings created
using dma_map_page, which is perfectly fine given that the sync calls
only take a dma_addr_t, but not a virtual address or struct page.
