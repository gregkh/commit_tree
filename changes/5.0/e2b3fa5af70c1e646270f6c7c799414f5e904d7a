block: Remove bio->bi_ioc

bio->bi_ioc is never set so always NULL. Remove references to it in
bio_disassociate_task() and in rq_ioc() and delete this field from
struct bio. With this change, rq_ioc() always returns
current->io_context without the need for a bio argument. Further
simplify the code and make it more readable by also removing this
helper, which also allows to simplify blk_mq_sched_assign_ioc() by
removing its bio argument.
