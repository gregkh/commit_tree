s390, kexec_file: drop arch_kexec_mem_walk()

Since s390 already knows where to locate buffers, calling
arch_kexec_mem_walk() has no sense. So we can just drop it as kbuf->mem
indicates this while all other architectures sets it to 0 initially.

This change is a preparatory work for the next patch, where all the
variant memory walks, either on system resource or memblock, will be
put in one common place so that it will satisfy all the architectures'
need.
