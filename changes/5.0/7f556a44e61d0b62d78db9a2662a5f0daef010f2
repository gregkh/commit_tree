blk-mq: refactor the code of issue request directly

Merge blk_mq_try_issue_directly and __blk_mq_try_issue_directly
into one interface to unify the interfaces to issue requests
directly. The merged interface takes over the requests totally,
it could insert, end or do nothing based on the return value of
.queue_rq and 'bypass' parameter. Then caller needn't any other
handling any more and then code could be cleaned up.

And also the commit c616cbee ( blk-mq: punt failed direct issue
to dispatch list ) always inserts requests to hctx dispatch list
whenever get a BLK_STS_RESOURCE or BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE, this is
overkill and will harm the merging. We just need to do that for
the requests that has been through .queue_rq. This patch also
could fix this.
