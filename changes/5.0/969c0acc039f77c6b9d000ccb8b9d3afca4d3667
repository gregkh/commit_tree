watchdog: Add pm8916 watchdog driver

The PM816 module is a versatile PMIC with many diverse functions
integrated, including, a watchdog.
This watchdog is subcomponent of the PON (Power On) peripheral,
in the same way as pwrkey/resin buttons.
It works with two timers (2-stages), the first one generates an
IRQ to the main SoC (APQ8016/MSM8916), the second one performs
the reset.

This driver expects the following device hierarchy:
[pm8916]->[pm8916-pon]->[pm8916-wdt]

It uses the pm8916 regmap to access PM8916 registers.
