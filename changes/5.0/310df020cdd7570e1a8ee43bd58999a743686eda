mmc: stop abusing the request queue_lock pointer

mmc uses the block layer struct request pointer to indirect their own
lock to the mmc_queue structure, given that the original lock isn't
reachable outside of block.c.  Add a lock pointer to struct mmc_queue
instead and stop overriding the block layer lock which protects fields
entirely separate from the mmc use.
