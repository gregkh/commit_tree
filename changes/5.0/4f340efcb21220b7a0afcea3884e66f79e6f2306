clk: zynqmp: Fix memory allocation in zynqmp_clk_setup

Fix memory allocation and use struct_size() in kzalloc(). This also
fixes the allocation size to be correct, and smaller, because before we
were allocating a bunch of sizeof(struct clk_hw_onecell_data) structures
for each struct clk_hw we needed.

Fixes: 3fde0e16d016 ("drivers: clk: Add ZynqMP clock driver")
