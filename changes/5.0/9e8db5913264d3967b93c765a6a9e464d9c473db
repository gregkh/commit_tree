net: avoid false positives in untrusted gso validation

GSO packets with vnet_hdr must conform to a small set of gso_types.
The below commit uses flow dissection to drop packets that do not.

But it has false positives when the skb is not fully initialized.
Dissection needs skb->protocol and skb->network_header.

Infer skb->protocol from gso_type as the two must agree.
SKB_GSO_UDP can use both ipv4 and ipv6, so try both.

Exclude callers for which network header offset is not known.
