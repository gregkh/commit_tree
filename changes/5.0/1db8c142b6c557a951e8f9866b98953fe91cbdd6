drm/scheduler: Add drm_sched_suspend/resume_timeout()

This patch adds two new functions to help client drivers suspend and
resume the scheduler job timeout. This can be useful in cases where the
hardware has preemption support enabled. Using this, it is possible to have
the timeout active only for the ring which is active on the ringbuffer.
This patch also makes the job_list_lock IRQ safe.
