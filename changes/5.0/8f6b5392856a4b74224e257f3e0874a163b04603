udp: add missing rehash callback to udplite

After commit 4cdeeee9252a ("net: udp: prefer listeners bound to an
address"), UDP-Lite only works when specifying a local address for
the sockets.

This is related to the problem addressed in the commit 719f835853a9
("udp: add rehash on connect()"). Moreover, __udp4_lib_lookup() now
looks for a socket immediately in the secondary hash table.

The issue was found with LTP/network tests (UDP-Lite test-cases).
