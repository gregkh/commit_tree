blkcg: clean up blkg_tryget_closest()

The implementation of blkg_tryget_closest() wasn't super obvious and
became a point of suspicion when debugging [1]. So let's clean it up so
it's obviously not the problem.

Also add missing RCU read locking to bio_clone_blkg_association(), which
got exposed by adding the RCU read lock held check in
blkg_tryget_closest().
