media: uvcvideo: Move decode processing to process context

Newer high definition cameras, and cameras with multiple lenses such as
the range of stereo-vision cameras now available have ever increasing
data rates.

The inclusion of a variable length packet header in URB packets mean
that we must memcpy the frame data out to our destination 'manually'.
This can result in data rates of up to 2 gigabits per second being
processed.

To improve efficiency, and maximise throughput, handle the URB decode
processing through a work queue to move it from interrupt context, and
allow multiple processors to work on URBs in parallel.
