pinctrl: merrifield: include bits.h instead of bitops.h

The reason of including <linux/bitops.h> here is just for BIT() and Co macros.

Since commit 8bd9cb51daac8

  ("... Move some macros from <linux/bitops.h> to a new <linux/bits.h> file"),

<linux/bits.h> is enough for such compile-time macros.
