bpf: zero out build_id for BPF_STACK_BUILD_ID_IP

When returning BPF_STACK_BUILD_ID_IP from stack_map_get_build_id_offset,
make sure that build_id field is empty. Since we are using percpu
free list, there is a possibility that we might reuse some previous
bpf_stack_build_id with non-zero build_id.
