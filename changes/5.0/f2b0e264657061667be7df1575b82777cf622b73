drm/bridge/synopsys: dsi: don't call __dw_mipi_dsi_probe from dw_mipi_dsi_bind

__dw_mipi_dsi_probe() does all the grabbing of resources and does it using
devm-helpers. So this is happening on each try of master bringup possibly
slowing down things a lot.

Drivers using the component framework may instead want to call
dw_mipi_dsi_probe separately in their probe function to setup resources
early. That way the dsi bus also gets created earlier and also not
recreated on each bind-try, so that attached panels can load their modules
and be probed way before the bridge-attach in the bind call.

So drop the call to __dw_mipi_dsi_probe and modify the function to take
a struct dw_mipi_dsi instead of the platform-device.
