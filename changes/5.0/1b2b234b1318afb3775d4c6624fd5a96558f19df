bpf: pass struct btf pointer to the map_check_btf() callback

If key_type or value_type are of non-trivial data types
(e.g. structure or typedef), it's not possible to check them without
the additional information, which can't be obtained without a pointer
to the btf structure.

So, let's pass btf pointer to the map_check_btf() callbacks.
