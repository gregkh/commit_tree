drbd: don't retry connection if peers do not agree on "authentication" settings

emma: "Unexpected data packet AuthChallenge (0x0010)"
 ava: "expected AuthChallenge packet, received: ReportProtocol (0x000b)"
      "Authentication of peer failed, trying again."

Pattern repeats.

There is no point in retrying the handshake,
if we expect to receive an AuthChallenge,
but the peer is not even configured to expect or use a shared secret.
