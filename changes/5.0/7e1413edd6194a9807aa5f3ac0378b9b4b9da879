tracing: Consolidate trace_add/remove_event_call back to the nolock functions

The trace_add/remove_event_call_nolock() functions were added to allow
the tace_add/remove_event_call() code be called when the event_mutex
lock was already taken. Now that all callers are done within the
event_mutex, there's no reason to have two different interfaces.

Remove the current wrapper trace_add/remove_event_call()s and rename the
_nolock versions back to the original names.
