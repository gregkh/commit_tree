mmc: tmio: fix reset operation

SD / MMC did not operate properly when suspend transition failed.
Because the SCC was not reset at resume, issue of the command failed.
Call the host specific reset function and reset the hardware in order to
add reset of SCC. This change also fixes tuning on some stubborn cards
on Gen2.

Based on work from Masaharu Hayakawa.
