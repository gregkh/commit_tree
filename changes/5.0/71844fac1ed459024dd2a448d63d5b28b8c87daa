nfp: add locking around representor changes

Up until now we never needed to keep a networking locks around
representors accesses, we only accessed them when device was
reconfigured (under nfp pf->lock) or on fast path (under RCU).
Now we want to be able to iterate over all representors during
notifications, so make sure representor assignment is done
under RTNL lock.
