drm/i915: Clean up scaler setup, v2.

On skylake we can switch to a high quality scaler mode when only 1 out
of 2 scalers are used, but on GLK and later bit 28 has a different
meaning. Don't set it, and make clear the distinction between
SKL and later PS values.

Changes since v1:
- Add missing break statement.
