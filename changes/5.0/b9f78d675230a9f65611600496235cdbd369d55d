drm/i915/selftests: Fix live_workarounds to actually do resets

The test was missing some magic ingredients to actually trigger the
resets.

In case of the full reset we need the I915_RESET_HANDOFF flag set, and in
case of engine reset we need a busy request.

Thanks to Chris for helping with reset magic.

v2:
 * Grab RPM ref over reset.
