drm/msm/dpu: Cleanup callers of dpu_hw_blk_init

Outside of superfluous parameter checks the dpu_hw_blk_init()
doesn't have any failure paths. Switch it over to be a void
function and we can remove error handling paths in all the functions
that call it. While we're in those functions remove unneeded
initialization for a static variable.

v3: No changes
v2: Removed a cleanup intended for a different patch
