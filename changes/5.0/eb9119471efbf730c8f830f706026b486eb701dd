bpf: pass destroy() as a callback and remove its ndo_bpf subcommand

As part of the transition from ndo_bpf() to callbacks attached to struct
bpf_offload_dev for some of the eBPF offload operations, move the
functions related to program destruction to the struct and remove the
subcommand that was used to call them through the NDO.

Remove function __bpf_offload_ndo(), which is no longer used.
