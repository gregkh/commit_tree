IB/mlx5: Enable modify and query verbs objects via DEVX

Enables modify and query verbs objects via the DEVX interface.
To support this the above DEVX handlers were changed to get any
object type via the UVERBS_IDR_ANY_OBJECT mechanism.

The type checking and handling is done per object as part of the
driver code.
