clocksource/drivers/meson6_timer: Use register names from the datasheet

This makes the driver use the names from S805 datasheet for the
preprocessor #defines. This makes it easier to spot that the driver
currently only supports Timer A (as clockevent with interrupt support)
and Timer E (as clocksource without interrupts). Timer B, C and D (which
are similar to Timer A) are currently not supported by the driver.

While here, this also removes the internal "CED_ID" and "CSD_ID" defines
which are used to identify the timer. These IDs are not described in the
datasheet and thus make it harder to compare the code to what's written
in the datasheet.
