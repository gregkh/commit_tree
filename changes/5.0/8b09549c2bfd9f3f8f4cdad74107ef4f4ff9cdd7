vmscan: return NODE_RECLAIM_NOSCAN in node_reclaim() when CONFIG_NUMA is n

Commit fa5e084e43eb ("vmscan: do not unconditionally treat zones that
fail zone_reclaim() as full") changed the return value of
node_reclaim().  The original return value 0 means NODE_RECLAIM_SOME
after this commit.

While the return value of node_reclaim() when CONFIG_NUMA is n is not
changed.  This will leads to call zone_watermark_ok() again.

This patch fixes the return value by adjusting to NODE_RECLAIM_NOSCAN.
Since node_reclaim() is only called in page_alloc.c, move it to
mm/internal.h.
