dt-bindings: new binding for Himax HX8357D display panels

This adds a new binding for Himax HX8357D display panels. It includes
a compatible string for one display (more can be added in the future).

The YX350HV15 panel[1] is found in the Adafruit PiTFT 3.5" Touch
Screen for Raspberry Pi.

This binding is closely modeled after the ili9341 binding, for a
similar product from adafruit.  The primary difference is that the
hx8357d doesn't have a reset line that I can find in the schematics.

v2: Document the "reg" property (requested by Rob), fix commit message
