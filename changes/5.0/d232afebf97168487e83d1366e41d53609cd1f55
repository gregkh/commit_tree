KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add function kvmhv_vcpu_is_radix()

There exists a function kvm_is_radix() which is used to determine if a
kvm instance is using the radix mmu. However this only applies to the
first level (L1) guest. Add a function kvmhv_vcpu_is_radix() which can
be used to determine if the current execution context of the vcpu is
radix, accounting for if the vcpu is running a nested guest.

Currently all nested guests must be radix but this may change in the
future.
