dt-bindings: net: broadcom-bluetooth: Add BCM4330 compatible string

The BCM4330 is a 802.11 a/b/g/n WiFi + Bluetooth 4.0 chip from Broadcom.
It is found in the Ampak AP6330 WiFi+BT module. The partiular one I have
identifies as BCM4330B1 for Bluetooth and BCM4330/4 for WiFi.

It is unclear if the AP6330 module uses this revision of the BCM4330, or
if there are multiple revisions. The module does not have revision
markings. This patch elects to use just BCM4330 for the compatible
string.
