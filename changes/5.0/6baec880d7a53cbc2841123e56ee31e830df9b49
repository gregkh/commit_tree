kasan: turn off asan-stack for clang-8 and earlier

Building an arm64 allmodconfig kernel with clang results in over 140
warnings about overly large stack frames, the worst ones being:

  drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-sitronix-st7789v.c:196:12: error: stack frame size of 20224 bytes in function 'st7789v_prepare'
  drivers/video/fbdev/omap2/omapfb/displays/panel-tpo-td028ttec1.c:196:12: error: stack frame size of 13120 bytes in function 'td028ttec1_panel_enable'
  drivers/usb/host/max3421-hcd.c:1395:1: error: stack frame size of 10048 bytes in function 'max3421_spi_thread'
  drivers/net/wan/slic_ds26522.c:209:12: error: stack frame size of 9664 bytes in function 'slic_ds26522_probe'
  drivers/crypto/ccp/ccp-ops.c:2434:5: error: stack frame size of 8832 bytes in function 'ccp_run_cmd'
  drivers/media/dvb-frontends/stv0367.c:1005:12: error: stack frame size of 7840 bytes in function 'stv0367ter_algo'

None of these happen with gcc today, and almost all of these are the
result of a single known issue in llvm.  Hopefully it will eventually
get fixed with the clang-9 release.

In the meantime, the best idea I have is to turn off asan-stack for
clang-8 and earlier, so we can produce a kernel that is safe to run.

I have posted three patches that address the frame overflow warnings
that are not addressed by turning off asan-stack, so in combination with
this change, we get much closer to a clean allmodconfig build, which in
turn is necessary to do meaningful build regression testing.

It is still possible to turn on the CONFIG_ASAN_STACK option on all
versions of clang, and it's always enabled for gcc, but when
CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST is set, the option remains invisible, so
allmodconfig and randconfig builds (which are normally done with a
forced CONFIG_COMPILE_TEST) will still result in a mostly clean build.
