signal: Restore the stop PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT

In the middle of do_exit() there is there is a call
"ptrace_event(PTRACE_EVENT_EXIT, code);" That call places the process
in TACKED_TRACED aka "(TASK_WAKEKILL | __TASK_TRACED)" and waits for
for the debugger to release the task or SIGKILL to be delivered.

Skipping past dequeue_signal when we know a fatal signal has already
been delivered resulted in SIGKILL remaining pending and
TIF_SIGPENDING remaining set.  This in turn caused the
scheduler to not sleep in PTACE_EVENT_EXIT as it figured
a fatal signal was pending.  This also caused ptrace_freeze_traced
in ptrace_check_attach to fail because it left a per thread
SIGKILL pending which is what fatal_signal_pending tests for.

This difference in signal state caused strace to report
strace: Exit of unknown pid NNNNN ignored

Therefore update the signal handling state like dequeue_signal
would when removing a per thread SIGKILL, by removing SIGKILL
from the per thread signal mask and clearing TIF_SIGPENDING.
