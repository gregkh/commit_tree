PCI: dwc: Move interrupt acking into the proper callback

The write to the status register is really an ACK for the HW,
and should be treated as such by the driver. Let's move it to the
irq_ack() callback, which will prevent people from moving it around
in order to paper over other bugs.

Fixes: 8c934095fa2f ("PCI: dwc: Clear MSI interrupt status after it is handled,
not before")
Fixes: 7c5925afbc58 ("PCI: dwc: Move MSI IRQs allocation to IRQ domains
hierarchical API")
