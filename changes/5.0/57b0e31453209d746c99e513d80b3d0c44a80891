KEYS: fix parsing invalid pkey info string

We need to check the return value of match_token() for Opt_err before
doing anything with it.

[ Not only did the old "-1" value for Opt_err cause problems for the
  __test_and_set_bit(), as fixed in commit 94c13f66e13c ("security:
  don't use a negative Opt_err token index"), but accessing
  "args[0].from" is invalid for the Opt_err case, as pointed out by Eric
  later.  - Linus ]
