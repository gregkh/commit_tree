crypto: aes_ti - disable interrupts while accessing S-box

In the "aes-fixed-time" AES implementation, disable interrupts while
accessing the S-box, in order to make cache-timing attacks more
difficult.  Previously it was possible for the CPU to be interrupted
while the S-box was loaded into L1 cache, potentially evicting the
cachelines and causing later table lookups to be time-variant.

In tests I did on x86 and ARM, this doesn't affect performance
significantly.  Responsiveness is potentially a concern, but interrupts
are only disabled for a single AES block.

Note that even after this change, the implementation still isn't
necessarily guaranteed to be constant-time; see
https://cr.yp.to/antiforgery/cachetiming-20050414.pdf for a discussion
of the many difficulties involved in writing truly constant-time AES
software.  But it's valuable to make such attacks more difficult.
