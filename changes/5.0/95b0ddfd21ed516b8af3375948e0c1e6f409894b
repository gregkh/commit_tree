arm64: dts: msm8916: thermal: split address space into two

We've earlier added support to split the register address space into TM
and SROT regions. Split up the regmap address space into two for msm8916
that has a similar register layout.

Since tsens-common.c/init_common() currently only registers one address
space, the order is important (TM before SROT).  This is OK since the
code doesn't really use the SROT functionality yet.
