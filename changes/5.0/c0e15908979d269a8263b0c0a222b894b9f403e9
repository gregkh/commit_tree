fs/locks: change all *_conflict() functions to return bool.

posix_locks_conflict() and flock_locks_conflict() both return int.
leases_conflict() returns bool.

This inconsistency will cause problems for the next patch if not
fixed.

So change posix_locks_conflict() and flock_locks_conflict() to return
bool.
Also change the locks_conflict() helper.

And convert some
   return (foo);
to
   return foo;
