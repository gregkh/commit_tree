nvmet: support for traffic based keep-alive

A controller that supports traffic based keep-alive can restart the keep
alive timer even when no keep-alive was not received in the kato period
as long as other admin or I/O commands were received.  For each command
set ctrl->cmd_seen to true, and when keep-alive timer expires, if any
commands were seen, resched ka_work instead of escalating to a fatal
error.
