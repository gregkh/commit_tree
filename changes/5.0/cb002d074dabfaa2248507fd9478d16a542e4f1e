iov_iter: pass void csum pointer to csum_and_copy_to_iter

The single caller to csum_and_copy_to_iter is skb_copy_and_csum_datagram
and we are trying to unite its logic with skb_copy_datagram_iter by passing
a callback to the copy function that we want to apply. Thus, we need
to make the checksum pointer private to the function.
