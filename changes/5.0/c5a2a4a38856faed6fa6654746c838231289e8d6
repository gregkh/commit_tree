ice: Fix to make VLAN priority tagged traffic to appear on all TCs

This patch includes below changes to resolve the issue of ETS bandwidth
shaping to work.

1. Allocation of Tx queues is accounted for based on the enabled TC's
   in ice_vsi_setup_q_map() and enabled the Tx queues on those TC's via
   ice_vsi_cfg_txqs()

2. Get the mapped netdev TC # for the user priority and set the priority
   to TC mapping for the VSI.
