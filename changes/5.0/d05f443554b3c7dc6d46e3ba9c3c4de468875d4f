iov_iter: introduce hash_and_copy_to_iter helper

Allow consumers that want to use iov iterator helpers and also update
a predefined hash calculation online when copying data. This is useful
when copying incoming network buffers to a local iterator and calculate
a digest on the incoming stream. nvme-tcp host driver that will be
introduced in following patches is the first consumer via
skb_copy_and_hash_datagram_iter.
