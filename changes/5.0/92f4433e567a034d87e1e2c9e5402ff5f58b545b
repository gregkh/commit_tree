xprtrdma: Simplify locking that protects the rl_allreqs list

Clean up: There's little chance of contention between the use of
rb_lock and rb_reqslock, so merge the two. This avoids having to
take both in some (possibly future) cases.

Transport tear-down is already serialized, thus there is no need for
locking at all when destroying rpcrdma_reqs.
