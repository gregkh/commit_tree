x86/a.out: Clear the dump structure initially

dump_thread32() in aout_core_dump() does not clear the user32 structure
allocated on the stack as the first thing on function entry.

As a result, the dump.u_comm, dump.u_ar0 and dump.signal which get
assigned before the clearing, get overwritten.

Rename that function to fill_dump() to make it clear what it does and
call it first thing.

This was caught while staring at a patch by Derek Robson
