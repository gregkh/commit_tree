KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Make vgic_dist->lpi_list_lock a raw_spinlock

vgic_dist->lpi_list_lock must always be taken with interrupts disabled as
it is used in interrupt context.

For configurations such as PREEMPT_RT_FULL, this means that it should
be a raw_spinlock since RT spinlocks are interruptible.
