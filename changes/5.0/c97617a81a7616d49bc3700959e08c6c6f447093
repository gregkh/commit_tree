ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Fix build error without CONFIG_PCI

A call of pci_iounmap() call without CONFIG_PCI leads to a build error
on some architectures.  We tried to address this and add a check of
IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_PCI), but this still doesn't seem enough for sh.
Ideally we should fix it globally, it's really a corner case, so let's
paper over it with a simpler ifdef.
