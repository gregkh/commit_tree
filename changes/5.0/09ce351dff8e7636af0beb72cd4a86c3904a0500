IB/hfi1: Add limit test for RC/UC send via loopback

Fix potential memory corruption and panic in loopback for IB_WR_SEND
variants.

The code blindly assumes the posted length will fit in the fetched rwqe,
which is not a valid assumption.

Fix by adding a limit test, and triggering the appropriate send completion
and putting the QP in an error state.  This mimics the handling for
non-loopback QPs.
