x86/PCI: Fix Broadcom CNB20LE unintended sign extension (redux)

In the expression "word1 << 16", word1 starts as u16, but is promoted to a
signed int, then sign-extended to resource_size_t, which is probably not
what was intended.  Cast to resource_size_t to avoid the sign extension.

This fixes an identical issue as fixed by commit 0b2d70764bb3 ("x86/PCI:
Fix Broadcom CNB20LE unintended sign extension") back in 2014.
