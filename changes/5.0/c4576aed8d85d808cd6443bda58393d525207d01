dm: fix request-based dm's use of dm_wait_for_completion

The md->wait waitqueue is used by both bio-based and request-based DM.
Commit dbd3bbd291 ("dm rq: leverage blk_mq_queue_busy() to check for
outstanding IO") lost sight of the requirement that
dm_wait_for_completion() must work with all types of DM devices.

Fix md_in_flight() to call the blk-mq or bio-based method accordingly.
