drm/msm/dpu: Correct dpu destroy and disable order

In case of msm drm bind failure, dpu_mdss_destroy is triggered.
In this function, resources are freed and pm runtime disable is
called, which triggers dpu_mdss_disable. Now in dpu_mdss_disable,
driver tries to access a memory which is already freed. This
results in kernel panic. Fix this by ensuring proper sequence
of dpu destroy and disable calls.

Changes in v2:
   - Removed double spacings [Jeykumar]
