perf tools: Fix diverse comment typos

Go over the tools/ files that are maintained in Arnaldo's tree and
fix common typos: half of them were in comments, the other half
in JSON files.

No change in functionality intended.

Committer notes:

This was split from a larger patch as there are code that is,
additionally, maintained outside the kernel tree, so to ease
cherry-picking and/or backporting, split this into multiple patches.

Just typos in comments, no need to backport, reducing the possibility of
possible backporting artifacts.
