dma-direct: merge swiotlb_dma_ops into the dma_direct code

While the dma-direct code is (relatively) clean and simple we actually
have to use the swiotlb ops for the mapping on many architectures due
to devices with addressing limits.  Instead of keeping two
implementations around this commit allows the dma-direct
implementation to call the swiotlb bounce buffering functions and
thus share the guts of the mapping implementation.  This also
simplified the dma-mapping setup on a few architectures where we
don't have to differenciate which implementation to use.
