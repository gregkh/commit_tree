btrfs: Refactor clustered extent allocation into find_free_extent_clustered

We have two main methods to find free extents inside a block group:

1) clustered allocation
2) unclustered allocation

This patch will extract the clustered allocation into
find_free_extent_clustered() to make it a little easier to read.

Instead of jumping between different labels in find_free_extent(), the
helper function will use return value to indicate different behavior.
