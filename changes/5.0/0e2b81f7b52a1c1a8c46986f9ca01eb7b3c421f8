tracing: Remove unneeded synth_event_mutex

Rmove unneeded synth_event_mutex. This mutex protects the reference
count in synth_event, however, those operational points are already
protected by event_mutex.

1. In __create_synth_event() and create_or_delete_synth_event(),
 those synth_event_mutex clearly obtained right after event_mutex.

2. event_hist_trigger_func() is trigger_hist_cmd.func() which is
 called by trigger_process_regex(), which is a part of
 event_trigger_regex_write() and this function takes event_mutex.

3. hist_unreg_all() is trigger_hist_cmd.unreg_all() which is called
 by event_trigger_regex_open() and it takes event_mutex.

4. onmatch_destroy() and onmatch_create() have long call tree,
 but both are finally invoked from event_trigger_regex_write()
 and event_trace_del_tracer(), former takes event_mutex, and latter
 ensures called under event_mutex locked.

Finally, I ensured there is no resource conflict. For safety,
I added lockdep_assert_held(&event_mutex) for each function.
