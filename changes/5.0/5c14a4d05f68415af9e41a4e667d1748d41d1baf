mac80211: Change default tx_sk_pacing_shift to 7

When we did the original tests for the optimal value of sk_pacing_shift, we
came up with 6 ms of buffering as the default. Sadly, 6 is not a power of
two, so when picking the shift value I erred on the size of less buffering
and picked 4 ms instead of 8. This was probably wrong; those 2 ms of extra
buffering makes a larger difference than I thought.

So, change the default pacing shift to 7, which corresponds to 8 ms of
buffering. The point of diminishing returns really kicks in after 8 ms, and
so having this as a default should cut down on the need for extensive
per-device testing and overrides needed in the drivers.
