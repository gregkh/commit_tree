ice: Check for q_vector when stopping rings

There is a gap in time between a VF reset, which sets the q_vector to
NULL, and the VF requesting mapping of the q_vectors. If
ice_vsi_stop_tx_rings() is called during this time, a NULL pointer
dereference is encountered. Add a check in ice_vsi_stop_tx_rings()
to ensure the q_vector is set to avoid this situation from occurring.
