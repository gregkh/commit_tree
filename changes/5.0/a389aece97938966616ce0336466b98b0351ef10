perf python: Do not force closing original perf descriptor in evlist.get_pollfd()

Ondřej reported that when compiled with python3, the python extension
regresses in evlist.get_pollfd function behaviour.

The evlist.get_pollfd function creates file objects from evlist's fds
and returns them in a list. The python3 version also sets them to 'close
the original descriptor' when the object dies (is closed), by passing
True via the 'closefd' arg in the PyFile_FromFd call.

The python's closefd doc says:

  If closefd is False, the underlying file descriptor will be kept open
  when the file is closed.

That's why the following line in python3 closes all evlist fds:

  evlist.get_pollfd()

the returned list is immediately destroyed and that takes down the
original events fds.

Passing closefd as False to PyFile_FromFd to fix this.
