media: ddbridge: Move asm includes after linux ones

Without this, cpumask_t and bool are not defined:

In file included from drivers/media/pci/ddbridge/ddbridge-ci.c:19:
In file included from drivers/media/pci/ddbridge/ddbridge.h:22:
./arch/arm/include/asm/irq.h:35:50: error: unknown type name 'cpumask_t'
extern void arch_trigger_cpumask_backtrace(const cpumask_t *mask,
                                                 ^
./arch/arm/include/asm/irq.h:36:9: error: unknown type name 'bool'
                                           bool exclude_self);
                                           ^

Doing a survey of the kernel tree, this appears to be expected because
'#include <asm/irq.h>' is always after the linux includes.

This also fixes warnings of this variety (with Clang):
