crypto: ux500 - Use proper enum in hash_set_dma_transfer

Clang warns when one enumerated type is implicitly converted to another:

drivers/crypto/ux500/hash/hash_core.c:169:4: warning: implicit
conversion from enumeration type 'enum dma_data_direction' to different
enumeration type 'enum dma_transfer_direction' [-Wenum-conversion]
                        direction, DMA_CTRL_ACK | DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT);
                        ^~~~~~~~~
1 warning generated.

dmaengine_prep_slave_sg expects an enum from dma_transfer_direction.
We know that the only direction supported by this function is
DMA_TO_DEVICE because of the check at the top of this function so we can
just use the equivalent value from dma_transfer_direction.

DMA_TO_DEVICE = DMA_MEM_TO_DEV = 1
