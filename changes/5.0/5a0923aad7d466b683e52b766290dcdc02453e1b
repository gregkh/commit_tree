dt-bindings: rtc: sun6i-rtc: Deprecate external clock output for A31

The A31 does not have an external clock output directly from the RTC.
Instead, it has four muxable clock outputs: three (A, B, C) are
controlled from the CCU, and the last (D) is controlled from the PRCM.

Deprecate the usage of the external clock output for the A31 compatible.
