btrfs: Refactor unclustered extent allocation into find_free_extent_unclustered()

This patch will extract unclsutered extent allocation code into
find_free_extent_unclustered().

And this helper function will use return value to indicate what to do
next.

This should make find_free_extent() a little easier to read.
