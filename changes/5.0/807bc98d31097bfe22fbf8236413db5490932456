ice: Fix debug print in ice_tx_timeout

Currently the debug print in ice_tx_timeout is printing useless and
duplicate values. First, head is being assigned to tx_ring->next_to_clean
and we are printing both of those values, but naming them HWB and NTC
respectively. Also, reading tail always returns 0 so remove that as well.

Instead of assigning the SW head (NTC) read to head, use the actual head
register and change the debug print to note that this is HW_HEAD. Also
reduce the scope of a couple variables.
