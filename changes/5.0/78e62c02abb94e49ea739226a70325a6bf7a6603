btrfs: Remove extent_io_ops::readpage_io_failed_hook

For data inodes this hook does nothing but to return -EAGAIN which is
used to signal to the endio routines that this bio belongs to a data
inode. If this is the case the actual retrying is handled by
bio_readpage_error. Alternatively, if this bio belongs to the btree
inode then btree_io_failed_hook just does some cleanup and doesn't retry
anything.

This patch simplifies the code flow by eliminating
readpage_io_failed_hook and instead open-coding btree_io_failed_hook in
end_bio_extent_readpage. Also eliminate some needless checks since IO is
always performed on either data inode or btree inode, both of which are
guaranteed to have their extent_io_tree::ops set.
