MIPS: Avoid FP ELF checks when CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n

When CONFIG_MIPS_FP_SUPPORT=n we don't support floating point, so we can
avoid needless checks of ELF headers specifying the FP ABI or NaN
encoding to use. Deselect CONFIG_ARCH_BINFMT_ELF_STATE in this case to
avoid the need for our arch_elf_pt_proc() & arch_check_elf() functions,
and stub out the mips_set_personality_nan() & mips_set_personality_fp()
functions such that SET_PERSONALITY() doesn't need to worry about any of
this.
