drm/i915: Add short HPD IRQ storm detection for non-MST systems

Unfortunately, it seems that the HPD IRQ storm problem from the early
days of Intel GPUs was never entirely solved, only mostly. Within the
last couple of days, I got a bug report from one of our customers who
had been having issues with their machine suddenly booting up very
slowly after having updated. The amount of time it took to boot went
from around 30 seconds, to over 6 minutes consistently.

After some investigation, I discovered that i915 was reporting massive
amounts of short HPD IRQ spam on this system from the DisplayPort port,
despite there not being anything actually connected. The symptoms would
start with one "long" HPD IRQ being detected at boot:

The customer's system in question has a GM45 GPU, which is apparently
well known for hotplugging storms.

So, workaround this impressively broken hardware by changing the default
HPD storm threshold from 5 to 50. Then, make long IRQs count for 10, and
short IRQs count for 1. This makes it so that 5 long IRQs will trigger
an HPD storm, and on systems with short HPD storm detection 50 short
IRQs will trigger an HPD storm. 50 short IRQs amounts to 100ms of
constant pulsing, which seems like a good middleground between being too
sensitive and not being sensitive enough (which would cause visible
stutters in userspace every time a storm occurs).

And just to be extra safe: we don't enable this by default on systems
with MST support. There's too high of a chance of MST support triggering
storm detection, and systems that are new enough to support MST are a
lot less likely to have issues with IRQ storms anyway.

As a note: this patch was tested using a ThinkPad T450s and a Chamelium
to simulate the short IRQ storms.

Changes since v1:
- Don't use two separate thresholds, just make long IRQs count for 10
  each and short IRQs count for 1. This simplifies the code a bit
  - Ville Syrjälä
Changes since v2:
- Document @long_hpd in intel_hpd_irq_storm_detect, no functional
  changes
Changes since v4:
- Remove !! in long_hpd assignment - Ville Syrjälä
- queue_hp = true - Ville Syrjälä
