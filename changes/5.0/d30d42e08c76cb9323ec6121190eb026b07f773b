bpf: Change insn_offset to insn_off in bpf_func_info

The later patch will introduce "struct bpf_line_info" which
has member "line_off" and "file_off" referring back to the
string section in btf.  The line_"off" and file_"off"
are more consistent to the naming convention in btf.h that
means "offset" (e.g. name_off in "struct btf_type").

The to-be-added "struct bpf_line_info" also has another
member, "insn_off" which is the same as the "insn_offset"
in "struct bpf_func_info".  Hence, this patch renames "insn_offset"
to "insn_off" for "struct bpf_func_info".
