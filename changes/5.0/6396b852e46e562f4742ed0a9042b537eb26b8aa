KVM: arm/arm64: Re-factor setting the Stage 2 entry to exec on fault

Stage 2 fault handler marks a page as executable if it is handling an
execution fault or if it was a permission fault in which case the
executable bit needs to be preserved.

The logic to decide if the page should be marked executable is
duplicated for PMD and PTE entries. To avoid creating another copy
when support for PUD hugepages is introduced refactor the code to
share the checks needed to mark a page table entry as executable.
