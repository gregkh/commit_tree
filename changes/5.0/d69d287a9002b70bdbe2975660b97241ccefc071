XArray tests: Check mark 2 gets squashed

We do not currently check that the loop in xas_squash_marks() doesn't have
an off-by-one error in it.  It didn't, but a patch which introduced an
off-by-one error wasn't caught by any existing test.  Switch the roles
of XA_MARK_1 and XA_MARK_2 to catch that bug.
