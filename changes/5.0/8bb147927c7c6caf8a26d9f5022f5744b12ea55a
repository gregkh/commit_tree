net: hns3: deleted logging 1 bit errors

This patch deletes logging 1 bit errors for the following reasons.
1. AER does not notify 1 bit errors to the device drivers.
   However AER reports 1 bit errors to the userspace through the
   trace_aer_event for logging in the rasdaemon.
2. Firmware clears the status of 1 bit errors in the hw registers.
