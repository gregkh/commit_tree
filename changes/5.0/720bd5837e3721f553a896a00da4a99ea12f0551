net: hns3: add set_default_reset_request in the hnae3_ae_ops

Currently, when reset_event is called because of tx timeout, it will
upgrade the reset level (For PF, HNAE3_FUNC_RESET -> HNAE3_CORE_RESET
-> HNAE3_GLOBAL_RESET) if the time between the new reset and last reset
is within 20 secs, or restore the reset level to HNAE3_FUNC_RESET if
the time between the new reset and last reset is over 20 secs.

There is requirement that the caller needs to decide the reset level
when triggering a reset, for example, RAS recovery. So this patch
adds the set_default_reset_request to meet this requirement.
