bpf: run bpf programs with preemption disabled

Disabled preemption is necessary for proper access to per-cpu maps
from BPF programs.

But the sender side of socket filters didn't have preemption disabled:
unix_dgram_sendmsg->sk_filter->sk_filter_trim_cap->bpf_prog_run_save_cb->BPF_PROG_RUN

and a combination of af_packet with tun device didn't disable either:
tpacket_snd->packet_direct_xmit->packet_pick_tx_queue->ndo_select_queue->
  tun_select_queue->tun_ebpf_select_queue->bpf_prog_run_clear_cb->BPF_PROG_RUN

Disable preemption before executing BPF programs (both classic and extended).
