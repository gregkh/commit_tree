brcmfmac: Call brcmf_dmi_probe before brcmf_of_probe

ARM systems with UEFI may have both devicetree (of) and DMI data in this
case we end up setting brcmf_mp_device.board_type twice.

In this case we should prefer the devicetree data, because:
1) The devicerree data is more reliable
2) Some ARM systems (e.g. the Raspberry Pi 3 models) support both UEFI and
   classic uboot booting, the devicetree data is always there, so using it
   makes sure we ask for the same nvram file independent of how we booted.

This commit moves the brcmf_dmi_probe call to before the brcmf_of_probe
call, so that the latter can override the value of the first if both are
set.
