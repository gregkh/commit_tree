treewide: surround Kconfig file paths with double quotes

The Kconfig lexer supports special characters such as '.' and '/' in
the parameter context. In my understanding, the reason is just to
support bare file paths in the source statement.

I do not see a good reason to complicate Kconfig for the room of
ambiguity.

The majority of code already surrounds file paths with double quotes,
and it makes sense since file paths are constant string literals.

Make it treewide consistent now.
