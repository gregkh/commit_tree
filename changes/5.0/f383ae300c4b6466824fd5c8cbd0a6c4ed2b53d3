bcache: cannot set writeback_running via sysfs if no writeback kthread created

"echo 1 > writeback_running" marks writeback_running even if no
writeback kthread created as "d_strtoul(writeback_running)" will simply
set dc-> writeback_running without checking the existence of
dc->writeback_thread.

Add check for setting writeback_running via sysfs: if no writeback
kthread available, reject setting to 1.

v2 -> v3:
  * Make message on wrong assignment more clear.
  * Print name of bcache device instead of name of backing device.
