mlx4: exploit skb->xmit_more to conditionally send doorbell

skb->xmit_more tells us if another skb is coming next.

We need to send doorbell when : xmit_more is not set,
or txqueue is stopped (preventing next skb to come immediately)

Tested with a modified pktgen version, I got a 40% increase of
throughput.
