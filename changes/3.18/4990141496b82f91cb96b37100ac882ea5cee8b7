ACPI / PNP: remove Fujitsu device IDs from ACPI PNP ID list

Fujitsu backlight and hotkey devices have ACPI drivers.

The PNP MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE in fujitsu-laptop driver is just used as an
indicator for module autoloading, but this is wrong because what we
need is ACPI module device table instead, because the driver is probing
ACPI devices.

Thus remove those IDs from ACPI PNP scan handler list as we don't
have a PNP driver for them, and convert the fujitsu-laptop PNP
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE to ACPI MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE.
