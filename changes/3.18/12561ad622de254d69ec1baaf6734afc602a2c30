[media] videobuf2-core: take mmap_sem before calling __qbuf_userptr

(Changes since v2: dropped local variable as suggested by Laurent)

Commit f035eb4e976ef5a059e30bc91cfd310ff030a7d3 (videobuf2: fix lockdep warning)
unfortunately removed the mmap_sem lock that is needed around the call to
__qbuf_userptr. Amazingly nobody noticed this (especially me as the author)
until Jan Kara pointed this out to me.
