ext4: pass allocation_request struct to ext4_(alloc,splice)_branch

Instead of initializing the allocation_request structure in
ext4_alloc_branch(), set it up in ext4_ind_map_blocks(), and then pass
it to ext4_alloc_branch() and ext4_splice_branch().

This allows ext4_ind_map_blocks to pass flags in the allocation
request structure without having to add Yet Another argument to
ext4_alloc_branch().
