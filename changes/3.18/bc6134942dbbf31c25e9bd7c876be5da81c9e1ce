KVM: nested VMX: disable perf cpuid reporting

Initilization of L2 guest with -cpu host, on L1 guest with -cpu host
triggers:

(qemu) KVM: entry failed, hardware error 0x7
...
nested_vmx_run: VMCS MSR_{LOAD,STORE} unsupported

Nested VMX MSR load/store support is not sufficient to
allow perf for L2 guest.

Until properly fixed, trap CPUID and disable function 0xA.
