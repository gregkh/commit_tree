locktorture: Teach about lock debugging

Regular locks are very different than locks with debugging. For instance
for mutexes, debugging forces to only take the slowpaths. As such, the
locktorture module should take this into account when printing related
information -- specifically when printing user passed parameters, it seems
the right place for such info.
