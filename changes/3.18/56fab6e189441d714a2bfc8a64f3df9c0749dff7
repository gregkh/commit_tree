PCI: mvebu: Fix uninitialized variable in mvebu_get_tgt_attr()

Geert Uytterhoeven reported a warning when building pci-mvebu:

  drivers/pci/host/pci-mvebu.c: In function 'mvebu_get_tgt_attr':
  drivers/pci/host/pci-mvebu.c:887:39: warning: 'rtype' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
     if (slot == PCI_SLOT(devfn) && type == rtype) {
					 ^

And indeed, the code of mvebu_get_tgt_attr() may lead to the usage of rtype
when being uninitialized, even though it would only happen if we had
entries other than I/O space and 32 bits memory space.

This commit fixes that by simply skipping the current DT range being
considered, if it doesn't match the resource type we're looking for.
