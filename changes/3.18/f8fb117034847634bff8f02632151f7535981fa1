ALSA: hda - Use standard hda_jack infrastructure for CA0132 driver

For its headphone, mic and DSP responses, we can use the standard
hda_jack infrastructure in CA0132 driver, too.  The only point to
handle carefully is the delayed headphone jack handling.  It tries to
react after a certain delay.  Here we use the existing block_report
flag in hda_jack_tbl (that was implemented for HDMI).
