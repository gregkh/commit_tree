ufs: Active Power Mode - configuring bActiveICCLevel

The maximum power consumption in active is determined by bActiveICCLevel.
The configuration is done by reading max current supported by the
regulators connected to VCC, VCCQ and VCCQ2 rails on the boards, and
reading the current consumption levels from the device for each rails
(vcc/vccq/vccq2) using power descriptor.
We configure the bActiveICCLevel attribute, with the max value that
correspond to the minimum-of(VCC-current-level,VCCQ-current-level,
VCCQ2-current-level).
In order to minimize resume latency, pre-fetch icc levels and reference
clock during initialization and avoid reading them each link startup
during resume.
