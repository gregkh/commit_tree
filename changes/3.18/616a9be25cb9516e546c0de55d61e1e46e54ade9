ipvs: Add simple weighted failover scheduler

Add simple weighted IPVS failover support to the Linux kernel. All
other scheduling modules implement some form of load balancing, while
this offers a simple failover solution. Connections are directed to
the appropriate server based solely on highest weight value and server
availability. Tested functionality with keepalived.
