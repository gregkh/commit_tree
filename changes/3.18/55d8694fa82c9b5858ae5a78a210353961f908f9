net: tcp: assign tcp cong_ops when tcp sk is created

Split assignment and initialization from one into two functions.

This is required by followup patches that add Datacenter TCP
(DCTCP) congestion control algorithm - we need to be able to
determine if the connection is moderated by DCTCP before the
3WHS has finished.

As we walk the available congestion control list during the
assignment, we are always guaranteed to have Reno present as
it's fixed compiled-in. Therefore, since we're doing the
early assignment, we don't have a real use for the Reno alias
tcp_init_congestion_ops anymore and can thus remove it.

Actual usage of the congestion control operations are being
made after the 3WHS has finished, in some cases however we
can access get_info() via diag if implemented, therefore we
need to zero out the private area for those modules.

Joint work with Daniel Borkmann and Glenn Judd.
