perf evlist: Monitor POLLERR and POLLHUP events too

We want to know when the fd went away, like when a monitored thread
exits.

If we do not monitor such events, then the tools will wait forever on
events from a vanished thread, like when running:

 $ sleep 5s &
 $ perf record -p `pidof sleep`

This builds upon the kernel patch by Jiri Olsa that actually makes a
poll on those file descriptors to return POLLHUP.

It is also needed to change the tools to use
perf_evlist__filter_pollfd() to check if there are remainings fds to
monitor or if all are gone, in which case they will exit the
poll/mmap/read loop.
