cpufreq: kirkwood: use the powersave multiplexer

The powersave clock acts like a multiplexer for the cpu, selecting
either the clock signal derived from the cpu pll or from the ddr clock.
This patch changes powersave from a gate clock to a mux clock to better
reflect this behavior.

This is a cleaner approach whereby the frequency of the cpu always
matches the rate of powersave_clk. The cpufreq driver for the kirkwood
platform no longer must parse this behavior out of various calls to
clk_enable and clk_disable, but can instead simply select the parent cpu
it wants when changing rate. Likewise when requesting the cpu rate we
need only query powersave_clk's rate through the usual call to
clk_get_rate.

The new clock data and corresponding changes to the cpufreq driver are
combined into this single commit to avoid a git bisect issue where this
cpufreq driver fails to work properly between the commit that updates
the kirkwood clock driver and the commit that changes how the cpufreq
driver uses that clock.
