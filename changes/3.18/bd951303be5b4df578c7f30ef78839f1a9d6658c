arm: mm: introduce special ptes for LPAE

We need a mechanism to tag ptes as being special, this indicates that no
attempt should be made to access the underlying struct page * associated
with the pte.  This is used by the fast_gup when operating on ptes as it
has no means to access VMAs (that also contain this information)
locklessly.

The L_PTE_SPECIAL bit is already allocated for LPAE, this patch modifies
pte_special and pte_mkspecial to make use of it, and defines
__HAVE_ARCH_PTE_SPECIAL.

This patch also excludes special ptes from the icache/dcache sync logic.
