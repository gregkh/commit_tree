UBI: block: fix dereference on uninitialized dev

commit 4df38926f337 ("UBI: block: Avoid disk size integer overflow")
introduced a dereference on dev (which is not initialized at that
point) when printing a warning message.  Re-order disk_capacity check
after the dev is found.

Found by cppcheck:
 [drivers/mtd/ubi/block.c:509]: (error) Uninitialized variable: dev

Artem: tweak the error message a bit
