netfilter: nf_reject_ipv4: split nf_send_reset() in smaller functions

That can be reused by the reject bridge expression to build the reject
packet. The new functions are:

* nf_reject_ip_tcphdr_get(): to sanitize and to obtain the TCP header.
* nf_reject_iphdr_put(): to build the IPv4 header.
* nf_reject_ip_tcphdr_put(): to build the TCP header.
