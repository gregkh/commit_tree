nl80211: sanity check the channel switch counter value

The nl80211 channel switch count attribute
(NL80211_ATTR_CH_SWITCH_COUNT) is specified as u32, but the
specification uses u8 for the counter.  To make sure strange things
don't happen without informing the user, sanity check the value and
return -EINVAL if it doesn't fit in u8.
