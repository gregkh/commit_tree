Smack: fix behavior of smack_inode_listsecurity

Security operation ->inode_listsecurity is used for generating list of
available extended attributes for syscall listxattr. Currently it's used
only in nfs4 or if filesystem doesn't provide i_op->listxattr.

The list is the set of NULL-terminated names, one after the other.
This method must include zero byte at the and into result.

Also this function must return length even if string does not fit into
output buffer or it is NULL, see similar method in selinux and man listxattr.
