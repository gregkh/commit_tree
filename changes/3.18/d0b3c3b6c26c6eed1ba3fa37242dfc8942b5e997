drm/nouveau: add reservation to nouveau_gem_ioctl_cpu_prep

Apart from some code inside ttm itself and nouveau_bo_vma_del,
this is the only place where ttm_bo_wait is used without a reservation.
Fix this so we can remove the fence_lock later on.

After the switch to rcu the reservation lock will be
removed again.
