spi: fsl: Sort include headers alphabetically

Sort all the include headers alphabetically for the freescale
spi drivers. If the inlcude headers sorted out of order, maybe
the best logical choice is to append new ones after the exist
ones, while this may create a lot of potential for duplicates
and conflicts for each diffenent changes will add new headers
in the same location.
