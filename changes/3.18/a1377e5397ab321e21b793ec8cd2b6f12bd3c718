usb: xhci: rework root port wake bits if controller isn't allowed to wakeup

When system is being suspended, if host device is not allowed to do wakeup,
xhci_suspend() needs to clear all root port wake on bits. Otherwise, some
platforms may generate spurious wakeup, even if PCI PME# is disabled.

The initial commit ff8cbf250b44 ("xhci: clear root port wake on bits"),
which also got into stable, turned out to not work correctly and had to
be reverted, and is now rewritten.
