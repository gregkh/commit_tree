PCI: designware: Parse bus-range property from devicetree

This allows to explicitly specify the covered bus numbers in the
devicetree, which will come in handy once we see a SoC with more than one
PCIe host controller instance.

Previously the driver relied on the behavior of pci_scan_root_bus() to fill
in a range of 0x00-0xff if no valid range was found.  We fall back to the
same range if no valid DT entry was found to keep backwards compatibility,
but now do it explicitly.
