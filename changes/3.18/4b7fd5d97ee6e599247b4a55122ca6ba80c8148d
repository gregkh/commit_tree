netfilter: explicit module dependency between br_netfilter and physdev

You can use physdev to match the physical interface enslaved to the
bridge device. This information is stored in skb->nf_bridge and it is
set up by br_netfilter. So, this is only available when iptables is
used from the bridge netfilter path.

Since 34666d4 ("netfilter: bridge: move br_netfilter out of the core"),
the br_netfilter code is modular. To reduce the impact of this change,
we can autoload the br_netfilter if the physdev match is used since
we assume that the users need br_netfilter in place.
