Input: xen-kbdfront - free grant table entry in xenkbd_disconnect_backend

xenkbd_disconnect_backend doesn't free grant table entry.  This bug affects
live migration.

xenkbd_disconnect_backend uses gnttab_end_foreign_access_ref to handle
grant table entry which doesn't really free an entry.

Thus every time we do xenkbd_resume, grant table entry increses by one. As
an grant table entry occupies 8 bytes, an grant table page has at most 512
entries. Every 512 times we do xenkdb_resume, grant table pages increses by
one.

After around 3500 times of live migration, grant table pages will increase
by 7, causing too many pages to populate and hitting max_pages limit when
assigning pages.Thus assign_pages will fail, so will live migration.
