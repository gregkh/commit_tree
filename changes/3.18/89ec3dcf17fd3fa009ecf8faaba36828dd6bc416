PCI: Generate uppercase hex for modalias interface class

Some implementations of modprobe fail to load the driver for a PCI device
automatically because the "interface" part of the modalias from the kernel
is lowercase, and the modalias from file2alias is uppercase.

The "interface" is the low-order byte of the Class Code, defined in PCI
r3.0, Appendix D.  Most interface types defined in the spec do not use
alpha characters, so they won't be affected.  For example, 00h, 01h, 10h,
20h, etc. are unaffected.

Print the "interface" byte of the Class Code in uppercase hex, as we
already do for the Vendor ID, Device ID, Class, etc.
