i2c: designware: prevent early stop on TX FIFO empty

If the Designware core is configured with IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN
set to zero, allowing the TX FIFO to become empty causes a STOP
condition to be generated on the I2C bus. If the transmit FIFO
threshold is set too high, an erroneous STOP condition can be
generated on long transfers - particularly where the interrupt
latency is extended.
