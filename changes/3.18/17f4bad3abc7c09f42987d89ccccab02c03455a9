ima: remove usage of filename parameter

In all cases except ima_bprm_check() the filename was not defined
and ima_d_path() was used to find the full path.  Unfortunately,
the bprm filename is a relative pathname (eg. ./<dir>/filename).

ima_bprm_check() selects between bprm->interp and bprm->filename.
The following dump demonstrates the differences between using
filename and interp.

bprm->filename
 filename: ./foo.sh, pathname: /root/bin/foo.sh
 filename: ./foo.sh, pathname: /bin/dash

bprm->interp
 filename: ./foo.sh, pathname: /root/bin/foo.sh
 filename: /bin/sh, pathname: /bin/dash

In both cases the pathnames are currently the same.  This patch
removes usage of filename and interp in favor of d_absolute_path.

Changes v3:
- 11 extra bytes for "deleted" not needed (Mimi)
- purpose "replace relative bprm filename with full pathname" (Mimi)

Changes v2:
- use d_absolute_path() instead of d_path to work in chroot environments.
