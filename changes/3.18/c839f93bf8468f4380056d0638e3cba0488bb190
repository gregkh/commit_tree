ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: Use rmobile_add_devices_to_domains()

Use a table and the rmobile_add_devices_to_domains() helper function to
add all platform devices to their power domains at once, which is more
size-efficient than calling rmobile_add_device_to_domain() explicitly
for all devices individually.
