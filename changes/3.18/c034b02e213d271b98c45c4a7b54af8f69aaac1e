cpufreq: expose scaling_cur_freq sysfs file for set_policy() drivers

Currently the core does not expose scaling_cur_freq for set_policy()
drivers this breaks some userspace monitoring tools.
Change the core to expose this file for all drivers and if the
set_policy() driver supports the get() callback use it to retrieve the
current frequency.
