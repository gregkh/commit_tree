rcu: Define tracepoint strings only if CONFIG_TRACING is set

Commit f7f7bac9cb1c ("rcu: Have the RCU tracepoints use the tracepoint_string
infrastructure") unconditionally populates the __tracepoint_str input section,
but this section is not assigned an output section if CONFIG_TRACING is not set.
This results in the __tracepoint_str turning up in unexpected places, i.e.,
after _edata.
