GenWQE: Support blocking when DDCB queue is busy

When the GenWQE hardware queue was busy, the driver returned simply
-EBUSY. This caused polling by applications which increased the load
on the already busy system. This change implements the possiblity to
sleep on a waitqueue instead when the DDCB queue is busy. The
requestor is woken up when there is free space on the queue again.
The old way to get -EBUSY is still available if the device is openend
with O_NONBLOCKING. The default is now blocking behavior.
