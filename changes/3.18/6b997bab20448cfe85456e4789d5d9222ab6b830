serial: atmel: add missing dmaengine header

The atmel serial driver uses dmaengine APIs but never included the dmaengine
header as it was getting inculded thru one of driver headers.

commit 3d588f83e4d6a5230d9094b97d38621cbaa9a972 - "dmaengine: dw: split
dma-dw.h to platform and private parts" broke this as it moved headers
around.  Fix this by doing the right thing to include the dmaengine header
