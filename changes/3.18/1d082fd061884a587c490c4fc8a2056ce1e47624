rcu: Remove local_irq_disable() in rcu_preempt_note_context_switch()

The rcu_preempt_note_context_switch() function is on a scheduling fast
path, so it would be good to avoid disabling irqs.  The reason that irqs
are disabled is to synchronize process-level and irq-handler access to
the task_struct ->rcu_read_unlock_special bitmask.  This commit therefore
makes ->rcu_read_unlock_special instead be a union of bools with a short
allowing single-access checks in RCU's __rcu_read_unlock().  This results
in the process-level and irq-handler accesses being simple loads and
stores, so that irqs need no longer be disabled.  This commit therefore
removes the irq disabling from rcu_preempt_note_context_switch().
