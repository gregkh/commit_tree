net: systemport: tell RXCHK if we are using Broadcom tags

When Broadcom tags are enabled, e.g: when interfaced to an Ethernet
switch, make sure that we tell the RXCHK engine that it should be
expecting a 4-bytes Broadcom tag after the Ethernet MAC Source Address.

Use netdev_uses_dsa() to check for that condition since that will tell
us if a switch is attached to our network interface.
