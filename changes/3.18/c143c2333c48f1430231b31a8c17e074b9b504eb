vfs: Remove d_drop calls from d_revalidate implementations

Now that d_invalidate always succeeds it is not longer necessary or
desirable to hard code d_drop calls into filesystem specific
d_revalidate implementations.

Remove the unnecessary d_drop calls and rely on d_invalidate
to drop the dentries.  Using d_invalidate ensures that paths
to mount points will not be dropped.
