mfd: cros_ec: stop calling ->cmd_xfer() directly

Instead of having users of the ChromeOS EC call the interface-specific
cmd_xfer() callback directly, introduce a central cros_ec_cmd_xfer()
to use instead.  This will allow us to put all the locking and retry
logic in one place instead of duplicating it across the different
drivers.
