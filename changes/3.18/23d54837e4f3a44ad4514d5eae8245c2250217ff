fs/proc/task_mmu.c: cleanup the "tail_vma" horror in m_next()

1. Kill the first "vma != NULL" check. Firstly this is not possible,
   m_next() won't be called if ->start() or the previous ->next()
   returns NULL.

   And if it was possible the 2nd "vma != tail_vma" check is buggy,
   we should not wrongly return ->tail_vma.

2. Make this function readable. The logic is very simple, we should
   return check "vma != tail" once and return "vm_next || tail_vma".
