cpufreq: cpufreq-dt: fix potential double put of cpu OF node

If cpufreq_generic_init() fails we jump into the resource
cleanup path which contains a of_node_put() call. Another
instance of this has already been called at that time
resulting a double decrement of the refcount.

Fix this by calling of_node_put() only after we are sure
that nothing has gone wrong.
