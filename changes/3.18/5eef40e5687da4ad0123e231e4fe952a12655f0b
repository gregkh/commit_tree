rtlwifi: btcoexist: Change local debugging macros CL_*** into the standard varieties

Macros CL_SNPRINTF and CL_PRINTF are always used in that order. The first
formats info into a buffer, and the second dumps it with printk. As the
debug system in rtlwifi has a macro that does this with a single call,
it seems reasonable to use it instead. An additional benefit is that the
debug level can be set when loading the driver used by the wifi device.
