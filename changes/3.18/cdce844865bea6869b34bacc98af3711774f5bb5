can: flexcan: add vf610 support for FlexCAN

Extend FlexCAN driver to support Vybrid. Vybrids variant of the IP
has ECC support which is controlled through the memory error
control register (MECR). There is also an errata which leads to
false positive error detections (ID e5295). This patch disables
the memory error detection completely.
