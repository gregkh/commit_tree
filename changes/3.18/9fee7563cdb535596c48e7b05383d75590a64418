KVM: PPC: BOOKE: allow debug interrupt at "debug level"

Debug interrupt can be either "critical level" or "debug level".
There are separate set of save/restore registers used for different level.
Example: DSRR0/DSRR1 are used for "debug level" and CSRR0/CSRR1
are used for critical level debug interrupt.

Using CPU_FTR_DEBUG_LVL_EXC to decide which interrupt level to be used.
