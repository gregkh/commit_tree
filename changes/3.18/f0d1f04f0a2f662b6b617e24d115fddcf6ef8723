netfilter: fix wrong arithmetics regarding NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_MAX

NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_MAX should be __NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_MAX - 1.

nft_reject_icmp_code() and nft_reject_icmpv6_code() are called from the
packet path, so BUG_ON in case we try to access an unknown abstracted
ICMP code. This should not happen since we already validate this from
nft_reject_{inet,bridge}_init().
