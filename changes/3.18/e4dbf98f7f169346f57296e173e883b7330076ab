thermal: Added Bang-bang thermal governor

The bang-bang thermal governor uses a hysteresis to switch abruptly on
or off a cooling device.  It is intended to control fans, which can
not be throttled but just switched on or off.
Bang-bang cannot be set as default governor as it is intended for
special devices only.  For those special devices the driver needs to
explicitely request it.
