ath10k: remove target soc ps code

The soc powersave was disabled by default. It
never was fully tested. Some hw apparently had
problems with it and the implementation itself had
a possible race.

Just remove the refcounting and simply wake up the
device when probing and put to sleep when
removing.

kvalo: make ath10k_pci_wake() and _sleep() static
