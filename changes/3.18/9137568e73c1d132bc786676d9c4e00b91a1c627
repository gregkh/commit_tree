tty: serial: 8250_core: remove UART_IER_RDI in serial8250_stop_rx()

serial8250_do_startup() adds UART_IER_RDI and UART_IER_RLSI to ier.
serial8250_stop_rx() should remove both.
This is what the serial-omap driver has been doing and is now moved to
the 8250-core since it does no look to be *that* omap specific.
