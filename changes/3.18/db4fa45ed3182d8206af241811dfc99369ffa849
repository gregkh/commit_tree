spi: pl022: Add support for chip select extension

Add support for a extended PL022 which has an extra register for controlling up
to five chip select signals. This controller is found on the AXM5516 SoC.
Unfortunately the PrimeCell identification registers are identical to a
standard ARM PL022. To work around this, the peripheral ID must be overridden
in the device tree using the "arm,primecell-periphid" property with the value
0x000b6022.
