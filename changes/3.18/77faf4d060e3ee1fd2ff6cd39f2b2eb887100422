perf tools: fix off-by-one error in maps

This patch fixes off-by-one errors in the management of maps.

A map is defined by start address and length as implemented by
map__new():

  map__init(map, type, start, start + len, pgoff, dso);

  map->start = addr;
  map->end = end;

Consequently, the actual address range is [start; end[ map->end is the
first byte outside the range.

This patch fixes two bugs where upper bound checking was off-by-one.

In V2, we fix map_groups__fixup_overlappings() some more where
map->start was off-by-one as reported by Jiri.
