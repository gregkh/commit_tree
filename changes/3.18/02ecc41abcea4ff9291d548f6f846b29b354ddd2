x86, microcode: Limit the microcode reloading to 64-bit for now

First, there was this: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88001

The problem there was that microcode patches are not being reapplied
after suspend-to-ram. It was important to reapply them, though, because
of for example Haswell's TSX erratum which disabled TSX instructions
with a microcode patch.

A simple fix was fb86b97300d9 ("x86, microcode: Update BSPs microcode
on resume") but, as it is often the case, simple fixes are too
simple. This one causes 32-bit resume to fail:

https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88391

Properly fixing this would require more involved changes for which it
is too late now, right before the merge window. Thus, limit this to
64-bit only temporarily.
