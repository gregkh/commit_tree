usb: gadget: f_fs: remove redundant ffs_data_get()

During FunctionFS bind, ffs_data_get() function was called twice
(in functionfs_bind() and in ffs_do_functionfs_bind()), while on unbind
ffs_data_put() was called once (in functionfs_unbind() function).
In result refcount never reached value 0, and ffs memory resources has
been never released.

Since ffs_data_get() call in ffs_do_functionfs_bind() is redundant
and not neccessary, we remove it to have equal number of gets ans puts,
and free allocated memory after refcount reach 0.

	interface with backward compatibility)
