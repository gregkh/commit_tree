mm: fix anon_vma_clone() error treatment

Andrew Morton noticed that the error return from anon_vma_clone() was
being dropped and replaced with -ENOMEM (which is not itself a bug
because the only error return value from anon_vma_clone() is -ENOMEM).

I did an audit of callers of anon_vma_clone() and discovered an actual
bug where the error return was being lost.  In __split_vma(), between
Linux 3.11 and 3.12 the code was changed so the err variable is used
before the call to anon_vma_clone() and the default initial value of
-ENOMEM is overwritten.  So a failure of anon_vma_clone() will return
success since err at this point is now zero.

Below is a patch which fixes this bug and also propagates the error
return value from anon_vma_clone() in all cases.
