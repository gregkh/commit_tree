integrity: remove declaration of non-existing functions

Commit f381c27 "integrity: move ima inode integrity data management"
(re)moved few functions but left their declarations in header files.
This patch removes them and also removes duplicated declaration of
integrity_iint_find().

Commit c7de7ad "ima: remove unused cleanup functions".  This patch
removes these definitions as well.
