perf probe: Fix --del option to delete events only with uprobe events

Current perf probe --del doesn't work if only CONFIG_UPROBE_EVENTS=y
because it aborts when it fails to open kprobe_events file before
checking uprobe_events file.

This fixes --del option to delete dynamic events if it can open either
kprobe_events or uprobe_events. Only if it failed to open both of them,
it shows an error message and aborts.

Without this patch, if we run perf probe -d on the kernel configured
with CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS=n and CONFIG_UPROBE_EVENTS=y,

  # perf probe -d \*
  kprobe_events file does not exist - please rebuild kernel with CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENTS.
    Error: Failed to delete events.

With this patch,

  # perf probe -d \*
  Removed event: probe_perf:alloc_event

Changes in v2:
 - Use strerror_r instead of strerror.
