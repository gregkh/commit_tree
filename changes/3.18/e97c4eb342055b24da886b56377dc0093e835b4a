ARM: OMAP5 / DRA7: PM: Provide a dummy startup function for CPU hotplug

Dont assume that all OMAP4+ code will be able to use OMAP4 hotplug
logic. On OMAP5, DRA7, we do not need this in place yet, also,
currently the CPU startup pointer is located in omap4_cpu_pm_info
instead of cpu_pm_ops.

So, isolate the function to hotplug_restart pointer in cpu_pm_ops
where it should have belonged, initalize them as per valid startup
pointers for OMAP4430/60 as in current logic, however provide
dummy_cpu_resume to be the startup location as well.
