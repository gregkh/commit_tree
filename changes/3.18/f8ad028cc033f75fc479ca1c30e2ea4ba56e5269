drm: Avoid random vblank counter jumps if the hardware counter has been reset

When drm_vblank_on() is called the hardware vblank counter may have
been reset, so we can't trust that the old values sampled prior to
drm_vblank_off() have anything to do with the new values.

So update the .last count in drm_vblank_on() to make the first
drm_vblank_enable() consider that as the reference point. This
will correct the user space visible counter to account for the
time between drm_vblank_on() and the first drm_vblank_enable()
calls.

For extra safety subtract one from the .last count in drm_vblank_on()
to make sure that user space will never see the same counter value
before and after modeset.
