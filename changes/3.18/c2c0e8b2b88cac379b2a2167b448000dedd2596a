f_ncm: Don't use netdev_start_xmit().

Unfortunately, the USB gadget layer has this weird things where NULL
skbs are passed into ops->ndo_start_xmit() in order to trigger the
dev->wrap() calls to build packets.

This is completely outside of the allowable range of sane arguments
for the ndo_start_xmit method.  All invocations of ndo_start_xmit()
should be with non-NULL SKB arguments.

Put back the direct call, but with a comment explaining how this
is not acceptable in the long term.
