kexec: take the segment adding out of locate_mem_hole functions

In locate_mem_hole functions, a memory hole is located and added as
kexec_segment.  But from the name of locate_mem_hole, it should only take
responsibility of searching a available memory hole to contain data of a
specified size.

So in this patch add a new field 'mem' into kexec_buf, then take that
kexec segment adding code out of locate_mem_hole_top_down and
locate_mem_hole_bottom_up.  This make clear of the functionality of
locate_mem_hole just like it declars to do.  And by this
locate_mem_hole_callback chould be used later if anyone want to locate a
memory hole for other use.

Meanwhile Vivek suggested opening code function __kexec_add_segment(),
that way we have to retreive ksegment pointer once and it is easy to read.
 So just do it in this patch and remove __kexec_add_segment() since no one
use it anymore.
