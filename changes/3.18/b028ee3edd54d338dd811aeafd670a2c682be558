KVM: s390: synchronize more registers with kvm_run

In order to reduce the number of syscalls when dropping to user space, this
patch enables the synchronization of the following "registers" with kvm_run:
- ARCH0: CPU timer, clock comparator, TOD programmable register,
         guest breaking-event register, program parameter
- PFAULT: pfault parameters (token, select, compare)

The registers are grouped to reduce the overhead when syncing.

As this grows the number of sync registers quite a bit, let's move the code
synchronizing registers with kvm_run from kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run() into
separate helper routines.
