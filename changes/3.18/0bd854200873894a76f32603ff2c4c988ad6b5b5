mem-hotplug: reset node present pages when hot-adding a new pgdat

When memory is hot-added, all the memory is in offline state.  So clear
all zones' present_pages because they will be updated in online_pages()
and offline_pages().  Otherwise, /proc/zoneinfo will corrupt:

When the memory of node2 is offline:

  # cat /proc/zoneinfo
  ......
  Node 2, zone   Movable
  ......
        spanned  8388608
        present  8388608
        managed  0

When we online memory on node2:

  # cat /proc/zoneinfo
  ......
  Node 2, zone   Movable
  ......
        spanned  8388608
        present  16777216
        managed  8388608
