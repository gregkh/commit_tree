locks: Rename __locks_copy_lock() to locks_copy_conflock()

Jeff advice, " Right now __locks_copy_lock is only used to copy
conflocks. It would be good to rename that to something more
distinct (i.e.locks_copy_conflock), to make it clear that we're
generating a conflock there."

v5: change order from 3/6 to 2/6
v4: new patch only renaming function name
