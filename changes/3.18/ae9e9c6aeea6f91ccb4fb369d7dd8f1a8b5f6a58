ext4: make ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() return proper number of blocks

ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() can return more blocks than are
actually allocated from map->m_lblk in case where initial part of the
on-disk extent is zeroed out. Luckily this doesn't have serious
consequences because the caller currently uses the return value
only to unmap metadata buffers. Anyway this is a data
corruption/exposure problem waiting to happen so fix it.
