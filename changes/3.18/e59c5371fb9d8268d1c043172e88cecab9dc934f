clk: introduce clk_set_phase function & callback

A common operation for a clock signal generator is to shift the phase of
that signal. This patch introduces a new function to the clk.h API to
dynamically adjust the phase of a clock signal. Additionally this patch
introduces support for the new function in the common clock framework
via the .set_phase call back in struct clk_ops.
