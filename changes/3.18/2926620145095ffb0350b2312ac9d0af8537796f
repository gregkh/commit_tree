dcache.c: call ->d_prune() regardless of d_unhashed()

the only in-tree instance checks d_unhashed() anyway,
out-of-tree code can preserve the current behaviour by
adding such check if they want it and we get an ability
to use it in cases where we *want* to be notified of
killing being inevitable before ->d_lock is dropped,
whether it's unhashed or not.  In particular, autofs
would benefit from that.
