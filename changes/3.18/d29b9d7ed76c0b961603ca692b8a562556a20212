KVM: x86: Fix uninitialized op->type for some immediate values

The emulator could reuse an op->type from a previous instruction for some
immediate values.  If it mistakenly considers the operands as memory
operands, it will performs a memory read and overwrite op->val.

Consider for instance the ROR instruction - src2 (the number of times)
would be read from memory instead of being used as immediate.

Mark every immediate operand as such to avoid this problem.
