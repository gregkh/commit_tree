drm/ast: POST chip at probe time if VGA not enabled

We need to do it on machines without a BIOS such as POWER8. Also
for detection to work without triggering PCIe errors, we need
to enable VGA early on, inside ast_detect_chip().

While touching those files, replace a few hard coded register
numbers with the corresponding symbolic constant.
