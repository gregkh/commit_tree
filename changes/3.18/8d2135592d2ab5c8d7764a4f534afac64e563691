target: Fix possible memory leak in aptpl_metadata parsing

Each case of match_strdup could leak memory if the same argument was
present before.  I am not too concerned, as it would require a
non-sensical combination like "target_lun=foo target_lun=bar", done
with root privileges and even then leak just a few bytes per instance.

But arg_p is different, as it will always leak memory.  Let's plug that
one.  And while at it, replace some &args[0] with args.
