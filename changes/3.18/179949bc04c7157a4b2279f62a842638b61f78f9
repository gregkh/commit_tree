ASoC: simple-card: remove dai_link->cpu_dai_name when DT

(ASoC: simple-card: cpu_dai_name creates confusion when DT case)
removed dai_link->cpu_dai_name when DT case,
since it uses DT phand in soc_bind_dai_link().
This binding will fail if it has cpu_dai_name.

(ASoC: simple-card: Handle many DAI links)
added multi DAI link support to simple-card driver.
Then, removing cpu_dai_name was cared only single DAI.
But, it is needed in all DT cases.
This patch moves it to asoc_simple_card_dai_link_of()
so that care about all DAIs.
