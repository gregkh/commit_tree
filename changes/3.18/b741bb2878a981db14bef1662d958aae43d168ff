ARM: dts: keystone-k2e: update usb1 node for dma properties

Keystone supports dma-coherent on USB master and also needs
dma-ranges to specify the hardware alias memory range in which DMA
can be operational.
Such configuration applied for USB0 devices, but It's missed for
USB1 device which is present only in K2E SoC - hence apply it.
