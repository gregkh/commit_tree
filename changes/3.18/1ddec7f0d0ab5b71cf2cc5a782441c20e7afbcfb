perf evlist: Introduce perf_evlist__filter_pollfd method

To remove all entries in evlist->pollfd[] that have revents matching at
least one of the bits in the specified mask.

It'll adjust evlist->nr_fds to the number of unfiltered fds and will
return this value, as a convenience and to avoid requiring direct access
to internal state of perf_evlist objects.

This will be used after polling the evlist fds so that we remove fds
that were closed by the kernel.
