f2fs: support large sector size

Block size in f2fs is 4096 bytes, so theoretically, f2fs can support 4096 bytes
sector device at maximum. But now f2fs only support 512 bytes size sector, so
block device such as zRAM which uses page cache as its block storage space will
not be mounted successfully as mismatch between sector size of zRAM and sector
size of f2fs supported.

In this patch we support large sector size in f2fs, so block device with sector
size of 512/1024/2048/4096 bytes can be supported in f2fs.
