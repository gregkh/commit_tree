Bluetooth: Add public l2cap_conn_shutdown() API to request disconnection

Since we no-longer do special handling of SMP within l2cap_core.c we
don't have any code for calling l2cap_conn_del() when smp.c doesn't like
the data it gets. At the same time we cannot simply export
l2cap_conn_del() since it will try to lock the channels it calls into
whereas we already hold the lock in the smp.c l2cap_chan callbacks (i.e.
it'd lead to a deadlock).

This patch adds a new l2cap_conn_shutdown() API which is very similar to
l2cap_conn_del() except that it defers the call to l2cap_conn_del()
through a workqueue, thereby making it safe to use it from an L2CAP
channel callback.
