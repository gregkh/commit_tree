ima: fix fallback to use new_sync_read()

3.16 commit aad4f8bb42af06371aa0e85bf0cd9d52c0494985
'switch simple generic_file_aio_read() users to ->read_iter()'
replaced ->aio_read with ->read_iter in most of the file systems
and introduced new_sync_read() as a replacement for do_sync_read().

Most of file systems set '->read' and ima_kernel_read is not affected.
When ->read is not set, this patch adopts fallback call changes from the
vfs_read.
