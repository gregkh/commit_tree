usb: serial: ftdi_sio: add "bricked" FTDI device PID

An official recent Windows driver from FTDI detects counterfeit devices
and reprograms the internal EEPROM containing the USB PID to 0, effectively
bricking the device.

Add support for this VID/PID pair to correctly bind the driver on these
devices.
