perf/x86/intel: Use Broadwell cache event list for Haswell

Use the newly added Broadwell cache event list for Haswell too.
All Haswell and Broadwell events and offcore masks used in these lists
are identical.

However Haswell is very different from the Sandy Bridge
list that was used previously. That fixes a wide range of mis-counting
cache events.

The node events are now only for retired memory events, so prefetching
and speculative memory accesses are not included. They are PEBS
capable now, which makes it much easier to sample for them, plus it's
possible to create address maps with -d.

The prefetch events are gone now. They way the hardware counts
them is very misleading (some prefetches included, others not), so
it seemed best to leave them out.
