staging: comedi: das16: prevent "empty acquisition" async command

This driver currently allows a cmd->stop_src == TRIG_COUNT with a cmd->stop_arg
of 0. The (*do_cmd) then sets up and starts the command without handling the "empty
acquisition". This results in the interrupt function trying to transfer 0 data
samples.

Validate that the cmd->stop_arg is >= 1 in the (*do_cmdtest) to prevent the
"empty acquisition".
