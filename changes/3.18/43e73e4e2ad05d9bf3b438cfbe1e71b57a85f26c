Bluetooth: Provide HCI command opcode information to driver

The Bluetooth core already does processing of the HCI command header
and puts it together before sending it to the driver. It is not really
efficient for the driver to look at the HCI command header again in
case it has to make certain decisions about certain commands. To make
this easier, just provide the opcode as part of the SKB control buffer
information. The extra information about the opcode is optional and
only provided for HCI commands.
