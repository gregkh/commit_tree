dm raid: ensure superblock's size matches device's logical block size

The dm-raid superblock (struct dm_raid_superblock) is padded to 512
bytes and that size is being used to read it in from the metadata
device into one preallocated page.

Reading or writing this on a 512-byte sector device works fine but on
a 4096-byte sector device this fails.

Set the dm-raid superblock's size to the logical block size of the
metadata device, because IO at that size is guaranteed too work.  Also
add a size check to avoid silent partial metadata loss in case the
superblock should ever grow past the logical block size or PAGE_SIZE.
