drm/gem: Don't call drm_mmap from drm_gem_mmap

The only user I could dig out was i915 back when ums+gem was still a
thing. But we've just very much killed that, and even when someone
screams about that we should resurrect that with a special hack
(wrapping drm_gem_mmap) in i915, not in the core code.

So good riddance to another entry point of the legacy buffer mapping
code.
