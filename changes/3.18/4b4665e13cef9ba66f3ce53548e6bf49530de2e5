UM: implement syscall_get_arch()

This patch defines syscall_get_arch() for the um platform.  It adds a
new syscall.h header file to define this.  It copies the HOST_AUDIT_ARCH
definition from ptrace.h.  (that definition will be removed when we
switch audit to use this new syscall_get_arch() function)
