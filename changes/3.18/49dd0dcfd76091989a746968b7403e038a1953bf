arm, vt8500, LLVMLlinux: Use mcr instead of mcr% for mach-vt8500

The ASM below does not compile with clang and is not the way that the mcr
command is used in other parts of the kernel.

arch/arm/mach-vt8500/vt8500.c:72:11: error: invalid % escape in inline assembly string
        asm("mcr%? p15, 0, %0, c7, c0, 4" : : "r" (0));
            ~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

There are other forms that are supported on different ARM instruction sets but
generally the kernel just uses mcr as it is supported in all ARM instruction
sets.
