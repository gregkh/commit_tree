cxl: Add new header for call backs and structs

This new header adds callbacks and structs needed by the rest of the kernel to
hook into the cxl infrastructure.

This adds the cxl_ctx_in_use() function for use in the mm code to see if any
cxl contexts are currently in use. This is used by the tlbie() to determine if
it can do local TLB invalidations or not. This also adds get/put calls for the
cxl driver module to refcount the active cxl contexts.

cxl_ctx_get/put/in_use are static inlined here as they are called in tlbie
which we want to be fast (mpe's suggestion).

Empty functions are provided when CONFIG_CXL_BASE is not enabled.
