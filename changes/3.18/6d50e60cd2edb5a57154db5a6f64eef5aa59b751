mm, thp: fix collapsing of hugepages on madvise

If an anonymous mapping is not allowed to fault thp memory and then
madvise(MADV_HUGEPAGE) is used after fault, khugepaged will never
collapse this memory into thp memory.

This occurs because the madvise(2) handler for thp, hugepage_madvise(),
clears VM_NOHUGEPAGE on the stack and it isn't stored in vma->vm_flags
until the final action of madvise_behavior().  This causes the
khugepaged_enter_vma_merge() to be a no-op in hugepage_madvise() when
the vma had previously had VM_NOHUGEPAGE set.

Fix this by passing the correct vma flags to the khugepaged mm slot
handler.  There's no chance khugepaged can run on this vma until after
madvise_behavior() returns since we hold mm->mmap_sem.

It would be possible to clear VM_NOHUGEPAGE directly from vma->vm_flags
in hugepage_advise(), but I didn't want to introduce special case
behavior into madvise_behavior().  I think it's best to just let it
always set vma->vm_flags itself.
