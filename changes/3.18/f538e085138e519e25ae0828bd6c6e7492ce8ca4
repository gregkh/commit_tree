[media] m88ts2022: fix 32bit overflow on filter calc

Maximum satellite symbol rate used is 45000000Sps which overflows
when multiplied by 135. As final calculation result is fraction,
we could use mult_frac macro in order to keep calculation inside
32 bit number limits and prevent overflow.

Original bug and fix was provided by Nibble Max. I decided to
implement it differently as it is now.
