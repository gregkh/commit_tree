gpio: handle also nested irqchips in the chained handler set-up

To unify how we connect cascaded IRQ chips to parent IRQs, if
NULL us passed as handler to the gpiochip_set_chained_irqchip()
function, assume the chips is nested rather than chained, and
we still get the parent set up correctly by way of this function
call.

Alter the drivers for tc3589x and stmpe to use this to set up
their chained handlers as a demonstration of the usage.
