tipc: remove files ref.h and ref.c

The reference table is now 'socket aware' instead of being generic,
and has in reality become a socket internal table. In order to be
able to minimize the API exposed by the socket layer towards the rest
of the stack, we now move the reference table definitions and functions
into the file socket.c, and rename the functions accordingly.

There are no functional changes in this commit.
