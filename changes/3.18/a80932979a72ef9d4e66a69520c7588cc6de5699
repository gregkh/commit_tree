ASoC: Always run default suspend/resume code

We do a bit more than just running the callbacks during suspend and resume
these days (e.g. call regcache_mark_dirty() during suspend). But this is
only when suspend and resume callbacks are specified for the driver,
otherwise nothing is done. This means that drivers which don't want to do
anything special during suspend and resume, but still want the standard
operations to run, need to provide empty suspend and resume callback
functions (rather than no callbacks). This patch updates the suspend and
resume code to always run standard sequence regardless of whether suspend
and resume handlers are provided.
