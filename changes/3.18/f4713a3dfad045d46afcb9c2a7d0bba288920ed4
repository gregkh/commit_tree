net-timestamp: make tcp_recvmsg call ipv6_recv_error for AF_INET6 socks

TCP timestamping introduced MSG_ERRQUEUE handling for TCP sockets.
If the socket is of family AF_INET6, call ipv6_recv_error instead
of ip_recv_error.

This change is more complex than a single branch due to the loadable
ipv6 module. It reuses a pre-existing indirect function call from
ping. The ping code is safe to call, because it is part of the core
ipv6 module and always present when AF_INET6 sockets are active.

It may also be worthwhile to add WARN_ON_ONCE(sk->family == AF_INET6)
to ip_recv_error.
