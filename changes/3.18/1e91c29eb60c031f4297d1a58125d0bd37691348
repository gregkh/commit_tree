Bluetooth: Use hci_disconnect for immediate disconnection from SMP

Relying on the l2cap_conn_del procedure (triggered through the
l2cap_conn_shutdown API) to get the connection disconnected is not
reliable as it depends on all users releasing (through hci_conn_drop)
and that there's at least one user (so hci_conn_drop is called at least
one time).

A much simpler and more reliable solution is to call hci_disconnect()
directly from the SMP code when we want to disconnect. One side-effect
this has is that it prevents any SMP Failure PDU from being sent before
the disconnection, however neither one of the scenarios where
l2cap_conn_shutdown was used really requires this.
