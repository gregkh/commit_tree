ALSA: ctxfi: pr_* replaced with dev_*

pr_* macros replaced with dev_* as they are more preffered over pr_*.
each file which had pr_* was reviewed manually and replaced with dev_*.
here we have actually used the various snd_card which was added to some
structures of ctxfi via a previous patch of this series.

in the ctvmem.c file we have passed a reference of ct_atc as an
argument to get_vm_block function so that it can be used from
dev_*.

since dev_* will print the device information , so the prefix of
"ctxfi" from the various pr_* were also removed.
