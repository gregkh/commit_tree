skbuff: fix ftrace handling in skb_unshare

If the skb is not dropped afterwards we should run consume_skb instead
kfree_skb. Inside of function skb_unshare we do always a kfree_skb,
doesn't depend if skb_copy failed or was successful.

This patch switch this behaviour like skb_share_check, if allocation of
sk_buff failed we use kfree_skb otherwise consume_skb.
