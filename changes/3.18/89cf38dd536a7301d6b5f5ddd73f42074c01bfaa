mtd: cfi_cmdset_0001.c: fix resume for LH28F640BF chips

After '#echo mem > /sys/power/state' some devices can not be properly resumed
because apparently the MTD Partition Configuration Register has been reset
to default thus the rootfs cannot be mounted cleanly on resume.
An example of this can be found in the SA-1100 Developer's Manual at 9.5.3.3
where the second step of the Sleep Shutdown Sequence is described:
"An internal reset is applied to the SA-1100. All units are reset...".

As workaround we refresh the PCR value as done initially on chip setup.

This behavior and the fix are confirmed by our tests done on 2 different Zaurus
collie units with kernel 3.17.
