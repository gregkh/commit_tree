ARM: zynq: DT: Remove 222 MHz OPP

Due to dependencies between timer and CPU frequency, only changes by
powers of two are allowed. The clocksource driver prevents other
changes, but with cpufreq and its governors it can result in being
spammed with error messages constantly. Hence, remove the 222 MHz OPP.
