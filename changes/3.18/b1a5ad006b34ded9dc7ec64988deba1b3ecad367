IB/isert: Adjust CQ size to HW limits

isert has an issue of trying to create a CQ with more CQEs than are
supported by the hardware, that currently results in failures during
isert_device creation during first session login.

This is the isert version of the patch that Minh Tran submitted for
iser, and is simple a workaround required to function with existing
ocrdma hardware.
