sched: Allow all architectures to set 'capacity_orig'

'capacity_orig' is only changed for systems with an SMT sched_domain level in order
to reflect the lower capacity of CPUs. Heterogenous systems also have to reflect an
original capacity that is different from the default value.

Create a more generic function arch_scale_cpu_capacity that can be also used by
non SMT platforms to set capacity_orig.

The __weak implementation of arch_scale_cpu_capacity() is the previous SMT variant,
in order to keep backward compatibility with the use of capacity_orig.

arch_scale_smt_capacity() and default_scale_smt_capacity() have been removed as
they were not used elsewhere than in arch_scale_cpu_capacity().
