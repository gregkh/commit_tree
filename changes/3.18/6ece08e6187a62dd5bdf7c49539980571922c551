autofs4: make "autofs4_can_expire" idempotent.

Have a "test" function change the value it is testing can be confusing,
particularly as a future patch will be calling this function twice.

So move the update for 'last_used' to avoid repeat expiry to the place
where the final determination on what to expire is known.
