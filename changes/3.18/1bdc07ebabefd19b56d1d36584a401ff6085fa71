isdn/gigaset: missing break in do_facility_req

If we take the unsupported supplementary service notification mask
path, we end up falling through and overwriting the error code.
Insert a break statement to skip the remainder of the switch case
and proceed to sending the reply message.

Spotted with Coverity.
