eeepc-laptop: check proper return values in get_cpufv

In get_cpufv the return value of get_acpi is stored in the cpufv struct.
Right before this value is checked for errors, it is and'ed with 0xff.
This means c->cur can never be less than zero. Besides that, the actual
error value is ignored.

c->num is also and'ed with 0xff, which means we can ignore values below
zero.

Check the result of get_acpi() right away. While at it, propagate the
error if we got one.
