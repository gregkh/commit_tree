powerpc/eeh: Clear frozen device state in time

The problem was reported by Carol: In the scenario of passing mlx4
adapter to guest, EEH error could be recovered successfully. When
returning the device back to host, the driver (mlx4_core.ko)
couldn't be loaded successfully because of error number -5 (-EIO)
returned from mlx4_get_ownership(), which hits offlined PCI device.
The root cause is that we missed to put the affected devices into
normal state on clearing PE isolated state right after PE reset.

The patch fixes above issue by putting the affected devices to
normal state when clearing PE isolated state in eeh_pe_state_clear().
