drm: Have the vblank counter account for the time between vblank irq disable and drm_vblank_off()

If the vblank irq has already been disabled (via the disable timer) when
we call drm_vblank_off() sample the counter and timestamp one last time.
This will make the sure that the user space visible counter will account
for time between vblank irq disable and drm_vblank_off().
