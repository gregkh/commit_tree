xen-netfront: Remove BUGs on paged skb data which crosses a page boundary

These BUGs can be erroneously triggered by frags which refer to
tail pages within a compound page. The data in these pages may
overrun the hardware page while still being contained within the
compound page, but since compound_order() evaluates to 0 for tail
pages the assertion fails. The code already iterates through
subsequent pages correctly in this scenario, so the BUGs are
unnecessary and can be removed.
