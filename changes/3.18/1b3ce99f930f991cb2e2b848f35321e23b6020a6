ARM: tegra: Add SATA and SATA power to Jetson TK1 device tree

This enables the integrated SATA controller on the Tegra124 system-on-chip
on the Jetson TK1 board and adds regulators for the onboard Molex connector
commonly used to power SATA devices. The regulators are marked always-on
since they can be used for other purposes than powering SATA devices.
