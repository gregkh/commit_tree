drivers/tty/nozomi.c: Use 'nozomi_setup_memory' instead of 'setup_memory'

Several architectures (e.g. microblaze, um, and score) have already have
extern 'setup_memory', so need use 'nozomi_setup_memory' instead of, or
will cause compiling issue.

The related error (with allmodconfig for microblaze):

  CC [M]  drivers/tty/nozomi.o
