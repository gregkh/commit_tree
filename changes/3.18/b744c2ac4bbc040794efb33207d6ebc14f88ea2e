fs: merge I/O error prints into one line

buffer.c uses two printk calls to print these messages:
[67353.422338] Buffer I/O error on device sdr, logical block 212868488
[67353.422338] lost page write due to I/O error on sdr

In a busy system, they may be interleaved with other prints,
losing the context for the second message.  Merge them into
one line with one printk call so the prints are atomic.

Also, differentiate between async page writes, sync page writes, and
async page reads.

Also, shorten "device" to "dev" to match the block layer prints:
[67353.467906] blk_update_request: critical target error, dev sdr, sector
1707107328

Also, use %llu rather than %Lu.

Resulting prints look like:
[ 1356.437006] blk_update_request: critical target error, dev sdr, sector 1719693992
[ 1361.383522] quiet_error: 659876 callbacks suppressed
[ 1361.385816] Buffer I/O error on dev sdr, logical block 256902912, lost async page write
[ 1361.385819] Buffer I/O error on dev sdr, logical block 256903644, lost async page write
