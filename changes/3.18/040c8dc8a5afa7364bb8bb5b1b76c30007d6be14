KVM: x86: emulating descriptor load misses long-mode case

In 64-bit mode a #GP should be delivered to the guest "if the code segment
descriptor pointed to by the selector in the 64-bit gate doesn't have the L-bit
set and the D-bit clear." - Intel SDM "Interrupt 13â€”General Protection
Exception (#GP)".

This patch fixes the behavior of CS loading emulation code. Although the
comment says that segment loading is not supported in long mode, this function
is executed in long mode, so the fix is necassary.
