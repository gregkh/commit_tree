ktest: Don't bother with bisect good or bad on replay

If git bisect reply is being used in the bisect tests, don't bother
doing the git bisect good or git bisect bad calls. The git bisect
reply will override them anyway, and that's called immediately
after the other two. Going the git bisect (good|bad) is just a
waste of time.
