Drivers: hv: vmbus: Cleanup vmbus_teardown_gpadl()

Eliminate calls to BUG_ON() by properly handling errors. In cases where
rollback is possible, we will return the appropriate error to have the
calling code decide how to rollback state. In the case where we are
transferring ownership of the guest physical pages to the host,
we will wait for the host to respond.
