ARM: 8222/1: mvebu: enable strex backoff delay

Under extremely rare conditions, in an MPCore node consisting of at
least 3 CPUs, two CPUs trying to perform a STREX to data on the same
shared cache line can enter a livelock situation.

This patch enables the HW mechanism that overcomes the bug. This fixes
the incorrect setup of the STREX backoff delay bit due to a wrong
description in the specification.

Note that enabling the STREX backoff delay mechanism is done by
leaving the bit *cleared*, while the bit was currently being set by
the proc-v7.S code.

[Thomas: adapt to latest mainline, slightly reword the commit log, add
stable markers.]

Fixes: de4901933f6d ("arm: mm: Add support for PJ4B cpu and init routines")
