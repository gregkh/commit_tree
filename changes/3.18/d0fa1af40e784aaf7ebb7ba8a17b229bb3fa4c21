drm: Drop modeset locking from crtc init function

At driver init no one can access modeset objects and we're
single-threaded. So locking is just cargo-culting here. Worse, with
the new ww mutexes and ww mutex slowpath debugging the mutex_lock
might actually fail, and we don't have the full-blown ww recovery
dance.

Which then leads to fireworks when we try to unlock the not-locked
crtc lock.

An audit of all the functions called from here shows that none of them
contain locking checks, so there's also no reason to keep the locking
around just for consistency of caller contexts. Besides that I have
the rule (at least in i915) that such places where we take locks just
to simplify locking checks and not for correctness always require a
comment.

This regression was introduced in
