drm/i915/dp: make backlight bl_power control power sequencer backlight

This lets the userspace switch off the backlight using the backlight
class sysfs bl_power file. The switch is done using the power sequencer;
the backlight PWM, and everything else, remains enabled. The display
backlight won't draw power, but for maximum power savings the encoder
needs to be switched off.
