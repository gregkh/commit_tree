staging: comedi: addi_apci_2032: remove "empty acquisition" async command

This driver currently allows a cmd->stop_src == TRIG_COUNT with a cmd->stop_arg
of 0. This causes the (*do_cmd) to immediatelt generate a COMEDI_CB_EOA event
without acquiring any data.

This "empty acquisition" async command is not really useful. Validate that the
cmd->stop_arg is >= 1 in the (*do_cmdtest) and remove the "empty acquisition"
code.
