of/selftest: Fix testing when /aliases is missing

The /aliases node isn't always present in the device tree, but the
unittest code assumes that /aliases is there. Add a check when inserting
the testcase data to see if of_aliases needs to be updated, and undo the
settings when the nodes are removed.
