drm/i915: Cancel vdd off work before suspend

Currently we just make sure vdd is off before suspending, but we don't
cancel the vdd off work. The work wil not touch vdd if
want_panel_vdd==false so in theory this is fine.

In the past that was perfectly fine since the vdd off work didn't do
anything when want_panel_vdd==false, so even if the work would have been
run during system resume before i915 has resumed, nothing would happen.

However since pps_lock() will now grab the power domain references before
it can check want_panel_vdd, we may end up toggling the power wells on/off
already before the driver has resumed. That is not really acceptable, so
cancel the vdd off work when suspending the encoder.

The problem appeared when pps_lock() was introduced in:
