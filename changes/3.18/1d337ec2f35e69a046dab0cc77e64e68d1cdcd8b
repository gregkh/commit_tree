ufs: improve init sequence

In ->hce_enable_notify() callback the vendor specific initialization
may carry out additional DME configuration using UIC commands and
hence the UIC command completion interrupt enable bit should be set
before the post reset notification.
Add retries if the link-startup fails. This is required since due to
hardware timing issues, the Uni-Pro link-startup might fail. The UFS
HCI recovery procedure contradicts the Uni-Pro sequence. The UFS HCI
specifies to resend DME_LINKSTARTUP command after IS.ULLS (link-lost
interrupt) is received. The Uni-Pro specifies that if link-startup
fails the link is in "down" state. The link-lost is indicated to the
DME user only when the link is up. Hence, the UFS HCI recovery procedure
of waiting for IS.ULLS and retrying link-startup may not work properly.

At the end, if detection fails, power off (disable clocks, regulators,
phy) if the UFS device detection fails. This saves power while UFS device
is not embedded into the system.
