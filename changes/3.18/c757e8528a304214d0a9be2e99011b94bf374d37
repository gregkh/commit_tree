iommu/arm-smmu: use page shift instead of page size to avoid division

Arbitrary integer division is not available in all ARM CPUs, so the GCC
may spit out calls to helper functions which are not implemented in
the kernel.

This patch avoids these problems in the SMMU driver by using page shift
instead of page size, so that divisions by the page size (as required
by the vSMMU code) can be expressed as a simple right shift.
