i2c: designware: add support of I2C standard mode

Some legacy devices support ony I2C standard mode at 100kHz.
This patch allows to select the standard mode through the DTS
with the use of the existing clock-frequency parameter.

When clock-frequency parameter is not set, the fast mode is selected.
Only when the parameter is set at 100000, the standard mode is selected.
