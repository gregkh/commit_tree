include/linux/screen_info.h: remove unused ORIG_* macros

The ORIG_* macros definitions to access struct screen_info members and all
of their users were removed 7 years ago by commit 3ea335100014785f
("Remove magic macros for screen_info structure members"), but (only) the
definitions reappeared a few days later in commit ee8e7cfe9d330d6f ("Make
asm-x86/bootparam.h includable from userspace.").

Remove them for good. Amen.
