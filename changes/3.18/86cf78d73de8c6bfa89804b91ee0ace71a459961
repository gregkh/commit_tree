fs/buffer.c: increase the buffer-head per-CPU LRU size

Increase the buffer-head per-CPU LRU size to allow efficient filesystem
operations that access many blocks for each transaction.  For example,
creating a file in a large ext4 directory with quota enabled will access
multiple buffer heads and will overflow the LRU at the default 8-block LRU
size:

* parent directory inode table block (ctime, nlinks for subdirs)
* new inode bitmap
* inode table block
* 2 quota blocks
* directory leaf block (not reused, but pollutes one cache entry)
* 2 levels htree blocks (only one is reused, other pollutes cache)
* 2 levels indirect/index blocks (only one is reused)

The buffer-head per-CPU LRU size is raised to 16, as it shows in metadata
performance benchmarks up to 10% gain for create, 4% for lookup and 7% for
destroy.
