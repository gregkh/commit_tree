sb_edac: avoid INTERNAL ERROR message in EDAC with unspecified channel

Intel IA32 SDM Table 15-14 defines channel 0xf as 'not specified', but
EDAC doesn't know about this and returns and INTERNAL ERROR when the
channel is greater than NUM_CHANNELS:

kernel: [ 1538.886456] CPU 0: Machine Check Exception: 0 Bank 1: 940000000000009f
kernel: [ 1538.886669] TSC 2bc68b22e7e812 ADDR 46dae7000 MISC 0 PROCESSOR 0:306e4 TIME 1390414572 SOCKET 0 APIC 0
kernel: [ 1538.971948] EDAC MC1: INTERNAL ERROR: channel value is out of range (15 >= 4)
kernel: [ 1538.972203] EDAC MC1: 0 CE memory read error on unknown memory (slot:0 page:0x46dae7 offset:0x0 grain:0 syndrome:0x0 -  area:DRAM err_code:0000:009f socket:1 channel_mask:1 rank:0)

This commit changes sb_edac to forward a channel of -1 to EDAC if the
channel is not specified.  edac_mc_handle_error() sets the channel to -1
internally after the error message anyway, so this commit should have no
effect other than avoiding the INTERNAL ERROR message when the channel
is not specified.
