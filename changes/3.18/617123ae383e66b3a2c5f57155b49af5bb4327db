[media] airspy: logging changes

Kernel logging system needs pointer to usb interface device in
order to print names and bus numbers properly. There was wrong
device pointer given and log printings wasn't correct.

Remove some debug logging from v4l2 ioctl functions. v4l2 core debug
prints almost same information when enabled.
