be2net: add a few log messages

This patch adds the following log messages to help debugging
failure cases:
1) log FW version number: this is useful when driver initialization
fails and the FW version number cannot be queried via ethtool
2) per function resource limits for BEx chips: these values are
currently being printed only for Skyhawk and Lancer
3) PCI BAR mapping failure
4) function_mode/caps queried from FW: this helps catch any FW bugs
that could advertise wrong capabilities to the driver
