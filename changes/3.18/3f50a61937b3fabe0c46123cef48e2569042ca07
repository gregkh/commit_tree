ARM: dts: imx6sl-evk: Fix display duplicate name warning

The lcdif node has a property named "display" and also a child node
called "display", which causes the following warning:

device-tree: Duplicate name in lcdif@02220000, renamed to "display#1"

Rename the child node name in order to avoid the warning.
