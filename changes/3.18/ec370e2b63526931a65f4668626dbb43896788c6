IB/iser: Unbind at conn_stop stage

Previously we didn't need to unbind the iser_conn and iscsi_conn since
we always relied on iscsi daemon to teardown the connection and never
let it finish before we cleanup all that is needed in iser.  This is
not the case anymore (for DEVICE_REMOVAL event).  So avoid any possible
chance we cause iscsi_conn dereference after iscsi_conn was freed.

We also call iser_conn_terminate (safe to call multiple times) just
for the corner case of iscsi daemon stopping an old connection before
invoking endpoint removal (might happen if it was violently killed).

Notice we are unbinding under a lock - which is required.
