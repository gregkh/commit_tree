tipc: fix a potential oops

Commit 6c9808ce09f7 ("tipc: remove port_lock") accidentally involves
a potential bug: when tipc socket instance(tsk) is not got with given
reference number in tipc_sk_get(), tsk is set to NULL. Subsequently
we jump to exit label where to decrease socket reference counter
pointed by tsk pointer in tipc_sk_put(). However, As now tsk is NULL,
oops may happen because of touching a NULL pointer.
