gre: Use inner mac length when computing tunnel length

Currently, skb_inner_network_header is used but this does not account
for Ethernet header for ETH_P_TEB. Use skb_inner_mac_header which
handles TEB and also should work with IP encapsulation in which case
inner mac and inner network headers are the same.

Tested: Ran TCP_STREAM over GRE, worked as expected.
