drm/tilcdc: panel: Add support for enable GPIO

In order to support the "enable GPIO" available in many panel devices,
this commit adds a proper devicetree binding.

By providing an enable GPIO in the devicetree, the driver can now turn
off and on the panel device, and/or the backlight device. Both the
backlight and the GPIO are optional properties.
