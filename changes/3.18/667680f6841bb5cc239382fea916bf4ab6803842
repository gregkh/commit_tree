powerpc/fsl-booke: Add initial T1042RDB_PI board support

T1042RDB_PI is Freescale Reference Design Board supporting the T1042
QorIQ Power Architecture™ processor. T1042 is a reduced personality
of T1040 SoC without Integrated 8-port Gigabit. The board is designed
with low power features targeted for Printing Image Market.

T1042RDB_PI is  similar to T1040RDB board with few differences like
it has video interface, supports T1042 personality only
