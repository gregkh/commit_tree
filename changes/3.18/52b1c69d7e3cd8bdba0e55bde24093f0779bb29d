Thermal: int340x_thermal: expose acpi thermal relationship tables

ACPI 4.0 introduced two thermal relationship tables via _ART
(active cooling) and  _TRT (passive cooling) objects. These
tables contain many to many relationships among thermal sensors
and cooling devices.

This patch parses _ART and _TRT and makes the result available to
the userspace via an misc device interface. At the same time,
kernel drivers can also request parsing results from internal
kernel APIs.

The results include source and target devices, influence, and
sampling rate in case of _TRT. For _ART, the result shows source
device, target device, and weight percentage.
