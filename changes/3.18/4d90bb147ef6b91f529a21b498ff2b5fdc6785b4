serial: core: Document and assert lock requirements for irq helpers

The serial core provides two helper functions, uart_handle_dcd_change()
and uart_handle_cts_change(), for UART drivers to use at interrupt
time. The serial core expects the UART driver to hold the uart port lock
when calling these helpers to prevent state corruption.

If lockdep enabled, trigger a warning if the uart port lock is not held
when calling these helper functions.
