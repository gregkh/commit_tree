Btrfs: fix wrong disk size when writing super blocks

total_size will be changed when resizing a device, and disk_total_size
will be changed if resizing is successful. Meanwhile, the on-disk super
blocks of the previous transaction might not be updated. Considering
the consistency of the metadata in the previous transaction, We should
use the size in the previous transaction to check if the super block is
beyond the boundary of the device. Fix it.
