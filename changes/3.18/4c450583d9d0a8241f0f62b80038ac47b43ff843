net: fix races in page->_count manipulation

This is illegal to use atomic_set(&page->_count, ...) even if we 'own'
the page. Other entities in the kernel need to use get_page_unless_zero()
to get a reference to the page before testing page properties, so we could
loose a refcount increment.

The only case it is valid is when page->_count is 0
