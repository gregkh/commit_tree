net: merge cases where sock_efree and sock_edemux are the same function

Since sock_efree and sock_demux are essentially the same code for non-TCP
sockets and the case where CONFIG_INET is not defined we can combine the
code or replace the call to sock_edemux in several spots.  As a result we
can avoid a bit of unnecessary code or code duplication.
