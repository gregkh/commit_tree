Btrfs: reduce size of struct extent_state

The tree field of struct extent_state was only used to figure out if
an extent state was connected to an inode's io tree or not. For this
we can just use the rb_node field itself.

On a x86_64 system with this change the sizeof(struct extent_state) is
reduced from 96 bytes down to 88 bytes, meaning that with a page size
of 4096 bytes we can now store 46 extent states per page instead of 42.
