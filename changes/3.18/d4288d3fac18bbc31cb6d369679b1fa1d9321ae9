ALSA: pcm: add new DSD sampleformat for native DSD playback on XMOS based devices

XMOS based USB DACs with native DSD support expose this feature via a USB
alternate setting. The audio format is either 32-bit raw or a 32-bit PCM format.
To utilize this feature on linux this patch introduces a new 32-bit DSD
sampleformat DSD_U32_LE.
A follow up patch will add a quirk for XMOS based devices to utilize the new format.
Further patches will add support to alsa-lib.
