i40e: Some FD message fixes

Change the message that gets printed when adding/deleting a filter to
the SB, so that user can tell if a filter was added or deleted.
Print filter add failures only in case of SB filters. For ATR the
information is not useful to the user and hence suppress it unless in
higher debug mode.
