drm/i915/bdw: GEN-specific logical ring emit flush

Same as the legacy-style ring->flush.

v2: The BSD invalidate bit still exists in GEN8! Add it for the VCS
rings (but still consolidate the blt and bsd ring flushes into one).
This was noticed by Brad Volkin.

v3: The command for BSD and for other rings is slightly different:
get it exactly the same as in gen6_ring_flush + gen6_bsd_ring_flush
