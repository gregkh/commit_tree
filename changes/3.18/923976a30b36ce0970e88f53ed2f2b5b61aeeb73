ASoC: sst-haswell-pcm: Move controls and DAPM elements to component

The sst-haswell-pcm driver registers both a snd_soc_component and a
snd_soc_platform and expects that the DAPM widgets for the DAIs registered by
component are added to the DAPM context of the platform. This requires us to
have a hack in the ASoC core which does so. Moving the DAPM elements over to
the component allows us to remove this hack.

While we are at it also move the controls over to the component. The controls
don't need the platform for anything other than snd_soc_platform_get_drvdata(),
this can easily be replaced by snd_soc_component_get_drvdata(). As the long
term goal is to register only a single component this is a step in the right
direction.
