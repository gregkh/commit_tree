isdn/gigaset: fix usb_gigaset write_cmd result race

In usb_gigaset function gigaset_write_cmd(), the length field of
the command buffer structure could be cleared by the transmit
tasklet before it was used for the function's return value.
Fix by copying to a local variable before scheduling the tasklet.
