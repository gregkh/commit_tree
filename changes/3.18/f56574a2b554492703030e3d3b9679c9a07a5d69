target/user: Recalculate pad size inside is_ring_space_avail()

If more than one thread is waiting for command ring space that includes
a PAD, then if the first one finishes (inserts a PAD and a CMD at the
start of the cmd ring) then the second one will incorrectly think it still
needs to insert a PAD (i.e. cmdr_space_needed is now wrong.) This will
lead to it asking for more space than it actually needs, and then inserting
a PAD somewhere else than at the end -- not what we want.

This patch moves the pad calculation inside is_ring_space_available() so
in the above scenario the second thread would then ask for space not
including a PAD. The patch also inserts a PAD op based upon an up-to-date
cmd_head, instead of the potentially stale value.
