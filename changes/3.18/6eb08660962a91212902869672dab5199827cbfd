perf probe: Don't use strerror if strlist__add failed

Since the strlist__add doesn't involves any IO, the failure reason must
be ENOMEM or EINVAL, moreover this is just a debug message, we don't
need to show the error string.

And also, if get_probe_trace_command_rawlist() returns NULL, it doesn't
mean the rawlist is empty, there is an error.  So caller must use
-ENOMEM for the error.
