net: tso: fix unaligned access to crafted TCP header in helper API

The crafted header start address is from a driver supplied buffer, which
one can reasonably expect to be aligned on a 4-bytes boundary.
However ATM the TSO helper API is only used by ethernet drivers and
the tcp header will then be aligned to a 2-bytes only boundary from the
header start address.
