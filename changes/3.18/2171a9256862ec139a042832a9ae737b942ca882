tools lib fd array: Allow associating an integer cookie with each entry

We will use this in perf's evlist class so that it can, at
fdarray__filter() time, to unmap the associated ring buffer.

We may need to have further info associated with each fdarray entry, in
that case we'll make that int array a 'union fdarray_priv' one and put a
pointer there so that users can stash whatever they want there. For now,
an int is enough tho.

v2: Add clarification to the per array entry priv area, as well as make
    it a union, which makes usage a bit longer, but if/when we make it
    use more space by allowing per entry pointers existing users source
    code will not have to be changed, just rebuilt.
