sched: Remove double_rq_lock() from __migrate_task()

Avoid double_rq_lock() and use TASK_ON_RQ_MIGRATING for
__migrate_task(). The advantage is (obviously) not holding two
rq->lock's at the same time and thereby increasing parallelism.

The important point to note is that because we acquire dst->lock
immediately after releasing src->lock the potential wait time of
task_rq_lock() callers on TASK_ON_RQ_MIGRATING is not longer
than it would have been in the double rq lock scenario.
