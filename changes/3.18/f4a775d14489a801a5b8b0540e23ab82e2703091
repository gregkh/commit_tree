net: introduce __skb_header_release()

While profiling TCP stack, I noticed one useless atomic operation
in tcp_sendmsg(), caused by skb_header_release().

It turns out all current skb_header_release() users have a fresh skb,
that no other user can see, so we can avoid one atomic operation.

Introduce __skb_header_release() to clearly document this.

This gave me a 1.5 % improvement on TCP_RR workload.
