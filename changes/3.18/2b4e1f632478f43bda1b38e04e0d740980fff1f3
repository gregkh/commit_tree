staging: comedi: add comedi_inc_scan_progress()

The "comedi_fc" module contains a few functions useful to Comedi
drivers.  Their functionality is being migrated to the core "comedi"
module and renamed to start with the prefix `comedi_`.  As part of this
migration, move `cfc_inc_scan_progress()` into the core comedi module
and rename it to `comedi_inc_scan_progress()`.  Change the external
declaration of `cfc_inc_scan_progress()` into an inline function that
calls `comedi_inc_scan_progress()`.
