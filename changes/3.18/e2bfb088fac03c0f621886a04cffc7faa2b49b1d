ext4: don't orphan or truncate the boot loader inode

The boot loader inode (inode #5) should never be visible in the
directory hierarchy, but it's possible if the file system is corrupted
that there will be a directory entry that points at inode #5.  In
order to avoid accidentally trashing it, when such a directory inode
is opened, the inode will be marked as a bad inode, so that it's not
possible to modify (or read) the inode from userspace.

Unfortunately, when we unlink this (invalid/illegal) directory entry,
we will put the bad inode on the ophan list, and then when try to
unlink the directory, we don't actually remove the bad inode from the
orphan list before freeing in-memory inode structure.  This means the
in-memory orphan list is corrupted, leading to a kernel oops.

In addition, avoid truncating a bad inode in ext4_destroy_inode(),
since truncating the boot loader inode is not a smart thing to do.
