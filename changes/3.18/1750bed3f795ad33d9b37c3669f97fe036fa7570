staging: comedi: adl_pci9118: introduce pci9118_ai_start_conv()

Writing any value to the "software trigger" register generates a trigger
pulse to start an A/D conversion. Introduce a helper function to clarify
this. For aesthetics, rename the define used for the register.

According to the datasheet the extra delay is not needed after starting
the conversion. Remove it.
