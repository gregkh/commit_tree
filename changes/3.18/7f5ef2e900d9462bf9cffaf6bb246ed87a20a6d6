nfsd: add a v4_end_grace file to /proc/fs/nfsd

Allow a privileged userland process to end the v4 grace period early.
Writing "Y", "y", or "1" to the file will cause the v4 grace period to
be lifted.  The basic idea with this will be to allow the userland
client tracking program to lift the grace period once it knows that no
more clients will be reclaiming state.
