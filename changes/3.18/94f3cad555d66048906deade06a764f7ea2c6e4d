xfs: check resblks before calling xfs_dir_canenter

Move the resblks test out of the xfs_dir_canenter,
and into the caller.

This makes a little more sense on the face of it;
xfs_dir_canenter immediately returns if resblks !=0;
and given some of the comments preceding the calls:

 * Check for ability to enter directory entry, if no space reserved.

even more so.

It also facilitates the next patch.
