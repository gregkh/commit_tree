sched/numa: Use select_idle_sibling() to select a destination for task_numa_move()

The code in task_numa_compare() will only examine at most one idle CPU per node,
because they all have the same score. However, some idle CPUs are better
candidates than others, due to busy or idle SMT siblings, etc...

The scheduler has logic to find the best CPU within an LLC to place a
task. The NUMA code should probably use it.

This seems to reduce the standard deviation for single instance SPECjbb2005
with a low warehouse count on my 4 node test system.
