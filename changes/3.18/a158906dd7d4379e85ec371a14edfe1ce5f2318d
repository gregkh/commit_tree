net/mlx5_core: Fix race in create EQ

After the EQ is created, it can possibly generate interrupts and the interrupt
handler is referencing eq->dev. It is therefore required to set eq->dev before
calling request_irq() so if an event is generated before request_irq() returns,
we will have a valid eq->dev field.
