ASoC: 88pm860x-codec: Cleanup manual bias level transitions

Since the ASoC core now takes care of setting the bias level to
SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF when removing the CODEC there is no need to do it manually
anymore either.

The manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY at the end of CODEC probe()
can also be removed as the core will automatically do this after the CODEC
has been probed.
