ARM: mvebu: Add proper pin muxing on Armada 370 RD board

This commit adds the required pin muxing for the network interfaces and
the MDIO interface to be properly initialized. For instance, this makes
it possible for a bootloader to initialize and access the network interfaces

Only the second network interface is pin muxed. The first network interface is
connected to the PHY using SGMII, which uses a dedicated SerDes lane.
