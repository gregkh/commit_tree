ASoC: max98090: Move interrupt request from codec probe to i2c probe

Keep MAX98090 interrupt requested after i2c device probing as long as the
driver is loaded. This fixes the issue where subsequent codec probe
max98090_probe() call fails in interrupt request since interrupt wasn't
freed over codec remove-reprobe cycle.
