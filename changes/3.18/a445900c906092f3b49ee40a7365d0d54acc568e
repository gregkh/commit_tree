i2c: designware: Add support for AMD I2C controller

Add support for AMD version of the DW I2C host controller. The device is
enumerated from ACPI namespace with ACPI ID AMD0010. Because the core
driver needs an input source clock, and this is not an Intel LPSS device
where clocks are provided through drivers/acpi/acpi_lpss.c, we register the
clock ourselves if the clock rate is given in ->driver_data
