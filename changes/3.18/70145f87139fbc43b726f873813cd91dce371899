pwm: Fix uninitialized warnings in pwm_get()

With some versions of gcc (e.g. 4.1.2):

drivers/pwm/core.c: In function ‘pwm_get’:
drivers/pwm/core.c:610: warning: ‘polarity’ may be used uninitialized in this function
drivers/pwm/core.c:609: warning: ‘period’ may be used uninitialized in this function

While these are false positives, we can get rid of them by refactoring
the code to store a pointer to the best match, as suggested before by
Thierry Reding. This does require moving the mutex_unlock() down.

Fixes: d717ea73e36dd565 ("pwm: Fix period and polarity in pwm_get() for non-perfect matches")
