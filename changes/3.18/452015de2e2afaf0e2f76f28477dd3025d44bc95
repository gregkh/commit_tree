[media] saa7134: add saa7134-go7007

This patch adds support to saa7134 for 'WIS Voyager or compatible' PCI boards
such as the Sensoray model 614 with which this patch was tested. It is a
saa7134-based PCI board with a go7007 MPEG encoder. This was a patch when the
go7007 was still in staging and was not applied when go7007 was moved to
drivers/media since it needed more work.

That work is now done and this last piece of go7007 support can now go in.
