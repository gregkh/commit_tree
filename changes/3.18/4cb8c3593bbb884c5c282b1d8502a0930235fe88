irda: stop calling sk_prot->disconnect() on connection failure

The sk_prot is irda's own set of protocol handlers, so irda should
statically know what that function is anyway, without using an indirect
pointer.  And as it happens, we know *exactly* what that pointer is
statically: it's NULL, because irda doesn't define a disconnect
operation.

So calling that function is doubly wrong, and will just cause an oops.
