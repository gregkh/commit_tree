kernel/sys.c: whitespace fixes

Fix minor errors and warning messages in kernel/sys.c.  These errors were
reported by checkpatch while working with some modifications in sys.c
file.  Fixing this first will help me to improve my further patches.

ERROR: trailing whitespace - 9
ERROR: do not use assignment in if condition - 4
ERROR: spaces required around that '?' (ctx:VxO) - 10
ERROR: switch and case should be at the same indent - 3

total 26 errors & 3 warnings fixed.
