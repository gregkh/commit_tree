tools lib api: Adopt fdarray class from perf's evlist

The extensible file description array that grew in the perf_evlist class
can be useful for other tools, as it is not something that only evlists
need, so move it to tools/lib/api/fd to ease sharing it.

v2: Don't use {} like in:

 libapi_dirs:
	$(QUIET_MKDIR)mkdir -p $(OUTPUT){fs,fd}/

in Makefiles, as it will not work in some systems, as in ubuntu13.10.

v3: Add fd/*.[ch] to LIBAPIKFS_SOURCES (Fix from Jiri Olsa)

v4: Leave the fcntl(fd, O_NONBLOCK) in the evlist layer, remains to
    be checked if it is really needed there, but has no place in the
    fdarray class (Fix from Jiri Olsa)

v5: Remove evlist details from fdarray grow/filter tests. Improve it a
    bit doing more tests about expected internal state.
