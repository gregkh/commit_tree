f2fs: fix negative value for lseek offset

If application throws negative value of lseek with SEEK_DATA|SEEK_HOLE,
previous f2fs went into BUG_ON in get_dnode_of_data, which was reported
by Tommi Rantala.

He could make a simple code to detect this having:
	lseek(fd, -17595150933902LL, SEEK_DATA);

This patch should resolve that bug.
