KVM: s390/mm: cleanup gmap function arguments, variable names

Make the order of arguments for the gmap calls more consistent,
if the gmap pointer is passed it is always the first argument.
In addition distinguish between guest address and user address
by naming the variables gaddr for a guest address and vmaddr for
a user address.
