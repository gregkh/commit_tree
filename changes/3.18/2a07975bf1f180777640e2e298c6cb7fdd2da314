ARM: config: enable hisilicon hip04

Enable CONFIG_ARCH_HIP04 in both hi3xxx_defconfig & multi_v7_defconfig.

Since CONFIG_ARM_LPAE is disabled by default, only 3GB memory could be
support by this defconfig. User should enable CONFIG_ARM_LPAE locally to
support 16GB memory on hip04 platform.

Since hip04 doesn't belong to hi3xxx series, rename hi3xxx_defconfig to
hisi_defconfig.
