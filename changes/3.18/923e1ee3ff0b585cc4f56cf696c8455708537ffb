r8152: clear SELECTIVE_SUSPEND when autoresuming

The flag of SELECTIVE_SUSPEND should be cleared when autoresuming.
Otherwise, when the system suspend and resume occur, it may have
the wrong flow.

Besides, because the flag of SELECTIVE_SUSPEND couldn't be used
to check if the hw enables the relative feature, it should alwayes
be disabled in close().
