iio: accel: BMC150: add support for other Bosch chips

The following chips are either similar or have only the resolution
different. Hence, change this driver to support these chips too:

BMI055  - combo chip (accelerometer part is identical to BMC150's)
BMA255  - identical to BMC150's accelerometer
BMA222E - 8 bit resolution
BMA250E - 10 bit resolution
BMA280  - 14 bit resolution

Additionally:
 * add bmc150_accel_match_acpi_device() function to check that the device
   has been enumerated through ACPI;
 * rename bmc150_accel_acpi_gpio_probe() to bmc150_accel_gpio_probe()
   since the ACPI matching has been moved to the new function.  Also, this
   will allow for the GPIO matching to be done against a device tree too, not only
   ACPI tree;
 * rename bmc150_scale_info struct member 'range' to 'reg_range' to be
   consistent with the naming convention used elsewhere in the driver
   and declare it u8, instead of int;
 * change CONFIG description to list all supported chips;
