qdisc: exit case fixes for skb list handling in qdisc layer

More minor fixes to merge commit 53fda7f7f9e (Merge branch 'xmit_list')
that allows us to work with a list of SKBs.

Fixing exit cases in qdisc_reset() and qdisc_destroy(), where a
leftover requeued SKB (qdisc->gso_skb) can have the potential of
being a skb list, thus use kfree_skb_list().

This is a followup to commit 10770bc2d1 ("qdisc: adjustments for
API allowing skb list xmits").
