staging: unisys: fix IO memory copy in channel.h

The function ULTRA_check_channel_client() was recently patched to use
ioread8_rep(). Unfortunately the parameters were incorrectly ordered, and this
causes the function to fail and the guest to not boot.

This patch switches the parameters around and uses memcpy_fromio() instead,
which is clearer since a structure is being copied, not an array, and it
fixes the error message printout later in the function that was using the UUID
value in the channel, rather than the value copied from the channel, which
causes a misleading error to be reported.
