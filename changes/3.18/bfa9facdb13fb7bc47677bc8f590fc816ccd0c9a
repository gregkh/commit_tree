staging: comedi: add comedi_read_array_from_buffer()

The "comedi_fc" module contains a few functions useful to Comedi
drivers.  Their functionality is being migrated to the core "comedi"
module and renamed to start with the prefix `comedi_`.  As part of this
migration, move `cfc_read_array_from_buffer()` into the core comedi
module and rename it to `comedi_read_array_from_buffer()`.  Change the
external declaration of `cfc_read_array_from_buffer()` into an inline
function that calls `comedi_read_array_from_buffer()`.
