powerpc: Speed up clear_page by unrolling it

Unroll clear_page 8 times. A simple microbenchmark which
allocates and frees a zeroed page:

for (i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
	unsigned long p = __get_free_page(GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO);
	free_page(p);
}

improves 20% on POWER8.

This assumes cacheline sizes won't grow beyond 512 bytes or
page sizes wont drop below 1kB, which is unlikely, but we could
add a runtime check during early init if it makes people nervous.

Michael found that some versions of gcc produce quite bad code
(all multiplies), so we give gcc a hand by using shifts and adds.
