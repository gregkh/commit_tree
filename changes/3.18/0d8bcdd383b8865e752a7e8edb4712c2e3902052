net: dsa: allow for more complex PHY setups

Modify the DSA slave interface to be bound to an arbitray PHY, not just
the ones that are available as child PHY devices of the switch MDIO bus.

This allows us for instance to have external PHYs connected to a
separate MDIO bus, but yet also connected to a given switch port.

Under certain configurations, the physical port mask might not be a 1:1
mapping to the MII PHYs mask. This is the case, if e.g: Port 1 of the
switch is used and connects to a PHY at a MDIO address different than 1.

Introduce a phys_mii_mask variable which allows driver to implement and
divert their own MDIO read/writes operations for a subset of the MDIO
PHY addresses.
