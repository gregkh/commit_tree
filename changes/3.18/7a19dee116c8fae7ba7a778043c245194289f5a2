xfs: Check error during inode btree iteration in xfs_bulkstat()

xfs_bulkstat() doesn't check error return from xfs_btree_increment(). In
case of specific fs corruption that could result in xfs_bulkstat()
entering an infinite loop because we would be looping over the same
chunk over and over again. Fix the problem by checking the return value
and terminating the loop properly.
