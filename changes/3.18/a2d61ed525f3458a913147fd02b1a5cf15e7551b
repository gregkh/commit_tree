integrity: make integrity files as 'integrity' module

The kernel print macros use the KBUILD_MODNAME, which is initialized
to the module name. The current integrity/Makefile makes every file
as its own module, so pr_xxx messages are prefixed with the file name
instead of the module.  Similar to the evm/Makefile and ima/Makefile,
this patch fixes the integrity/Makefile to use the single name
'integrity'.
