mac80211: don't duplicate station QoS capability data

We currently track the QoS capability twice: for all peer stations
in the WLAN_STA_WME flag, and for any clients associated to an AP
interface separately for drivers in the sta->sta.wme field.

Remove the WLAN_STA_WME flag and track the capability only in the
driver-visible field, getting rid of the limitation that the field
is only valid in AP mode.
