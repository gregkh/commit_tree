clk: at91: rework rm9200 USB clock to propagate set_rate to the parent clk

The RM9200 USB clock is actually connected to a single parent (the PLLB)
on which we can apply a specific divider.
The USB clock divider does not allow for fine grained control on the USB
clock frequency, hence propagating the set_rate request to the parent is
the only choice we have to properly configure the USB clock rate.
