KVM: x86: propagate exception from permission checks on the nested page fault

Currently, if a permission error happens during the translation of
the final GPA to HPA, walk_addr_generic returns 0 but does not fill
in walker->fault.  To avoid this, add an x86_exception* argument
to the translate_gpa function, and let it fill in walker->fault.
The nested_page_fault field will be true, since the walk_mmu is the
nested_mmu and translate_gpu instead operates on the "outer" (NPT)
instance.
