efi: Resolve some shadow warnings

It is a really bad idea to declare variables or parameters that
have the same name as common types. It is valid C, but it gets
surprising if a macro expansion attempts to declare an inner
local with that type. Change the local names to eliminate the
hazard.

Change s16 => str16, s8 => str8.

This resolves warnings seen when using W=2 during make, for instance:

drivers/firmware/efi/vars.c: In function ‘dup_variable_bug’:
drivers/firmware/efi/vars.c:324:44: warning: declaration of ‘s16’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
 static void dup_variable_bug(efi_char16_t *s16, efi_guid_t *vendor_guid,

drivers/firmware/efi/vars.c:328:8: warning: declaration of ‘s8’ shadows a global declaration [-Wshadow]
  char *s8;
