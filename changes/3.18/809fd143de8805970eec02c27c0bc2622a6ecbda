NFSv4: Ensure nfs_atomic_open set the dentry verifier on ENOENT

If the OPEN rpc call to the server fails with an ENOENT call, nfs_atomic_open
will create a negative dentry for that file, however it currently fails
to call nfs_set_verifier(), thus causing the dentry to be immediately
revalidated on the next call to nfs_lookup_revalidate() instead of following
the usual lookup caching rules.
