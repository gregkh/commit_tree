net: tcp: split ack slow/fast events from cwnd_event

The congestion control ops "cwnd_event" currently supports
CA_EVENT_FAST_ACK and CA_EVENT_SLOW_ACK events (among others).
Both FAST and SLOW_ACK are only used by Westwood congestion
control algorithm.

This removes both flags from cwnd_event and adds a new
in_ack_event callback for this. The goal is to be able to
provide more detailed information about ACKs, such as whether
ECE flag was set, or whether the ACK resulted in a window
update.

It is required for DataCenter TCP (DCTCP) congestion control
algorithm as it makes a different choice depending on ECE being
set or not.

Joint work with Daniel Borkmann and Glenn Judd.
