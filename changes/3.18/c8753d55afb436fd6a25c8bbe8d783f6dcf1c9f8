net: Cleanup skb cloning by adding SKB_FCLONE_FREE

SKB_FCLONE_UNAVAILABLE has overloaded meaning depending on type of skb.
1: If skb is allocated from head_cache, it indicates fclone is not available.
2: If skb is a companion fclone skb (allocated from fclone_cache), it indicates
it is available to be used.

To avoid confusion for case 2 above, this patch  replaces
SKB_FCLONE_UNAVAILABLE with SKB_FCLONE_FREE where appropriate. For fclone
companion skbs, this indicates it is free for use.

SKB_FCLONE_UNAVAILABLE will now simply indicate skb is from head_cache and
cannot / will not have a companion fclone.
