Fixing lease renewal

Commit c9fdeb28 removed a 'continue' after checking if the lease needs
to be renewed. However, if client hasn't moved, the code falls down to
starting reboot recovery erroneously (ie., sends open reclaim and gets
back stale_clientid error) before recovering from getting stale_clientid
on the renew operation.
