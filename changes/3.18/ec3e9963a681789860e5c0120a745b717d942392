drm/i915/bdw: Deferred creation of user-created LRCs

The backing objects and ringbuffers for contexts created via open
fd are actually empty until the user starts sending execbuffers to
them. At that point, we allocate & populate them. We do this because,
at create time, we really don't know which engine is going to be used
with the context later on (and we don't want to waste memory on
objects that we might never use).

v2: As contexts created via ioctl can only be used with the render
ring, we have enough information to allocate & populate them right
away.

v3: Defer the creation always, even with ioctl-created contexts, as
requested by Daniel Vetter.
