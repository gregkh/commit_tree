rcutorture: Add callback-flood test

Although RCU is designed to handle arbitrary floods of callbacks, this
capability is not routinely tested.   This commit therefore adds a
cbflood capability in which kthreads repeatedly registers large numbers
of callbacks.  One such kthread is created for each four CPUs (rounding
up), and the test may be controlled by several cbflood_* kernel boot
parameters, which control the number of bursts per flood, the number
of callbacks per burst, the time between bursts, and the time between
floods.  The default values are large enough to exercise RCU's emergency
responses to callback flooding.
