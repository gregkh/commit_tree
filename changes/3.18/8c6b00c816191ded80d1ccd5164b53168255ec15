net/openvswitch/flow.c: Replace rcu_dereference() with rcu_access_pointer()

The "rcu_dereference()" call is used directly in a condition.
Since its return value is never dereferenced it is recommended to use
"rcu_access_pointer()" instead of "rcu_dereference()".
Therefore, this patch makes the replacement.

The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used:

(
 if(
 (<+...

  (...)
  ...+>)) {...}
|
 while(
 (<+...
- rcu_dereference
+ rcu_access_pointer
  (...)
  ...+>)) {...}
)
