fsl_ifc: Fix csor_ext position in fsl_ifc_regs

According to Freescale manuals, the IFC_CSORn_EXT register is located
immediately _after_ the bank's IFC_CSORn register.

This patch adjusts the csor_ext member of and reserved register arrays
immediately surrounding the csor_cs structure to provide proper access
to this register.
