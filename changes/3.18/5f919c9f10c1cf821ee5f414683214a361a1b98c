pnfs: allow splicing pre-encoded pages into the layoutcommit args

Currently there is no XDR buffer space allocated for the per-layout driver
layoutcommit payload, which leads to server buffer overflows in the
blocklayout driver even under simple workloads.  As we can't do per-layout
sizes for XDR operations we'll have to splice a previously encoded list
of pages into the XDR stream, similar to how we handle ACL buffers.
