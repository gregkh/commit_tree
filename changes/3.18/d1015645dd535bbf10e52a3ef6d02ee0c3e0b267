sunvnet: Avoid sending superfluous LDC messages.

When sending out a burst of packets across multiple descriptors,
it is sufficient to send one LDC "start" trigger for
the first descriptor, so do not send an LDC "start" for every
pass through vnet_start_xmit. Similarly, it is sufficient to send
one "DRING_STOPPED" trigger for the last dring (and if that
fails, hold off and send the trigger later).

Optimizations to the number of LDC messages helps avoid
filling up the LDC channel with superfluous LDC messages
that risk triggering flow-control on the channel,
and also boosts performance.
