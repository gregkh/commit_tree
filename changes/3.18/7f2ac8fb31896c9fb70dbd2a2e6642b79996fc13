iwlwifi: pcie: fix polling in various places

iwl_poll_bit may return a strictly positive value when the
poll doesn't match on the first try.
This was caught when WoWLAN started failing upon resume
even if the poll_bit actually succeeded.

Also change a wrong print. If we reach the end of
iwl_pcie_prepare_card_hw, it means that we couldn't
get the devices.
