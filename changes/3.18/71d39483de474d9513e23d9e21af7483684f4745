drm: move "struct drm_magic_entry" to drm_auth.c

In drm_release(), we currently call drm_remove_magic() if the drm_file
has a drm-magic attached. Therefore, once drm_master_release() is called,
the magic-list _must_ be empty.

By dropping the no-op cleanup, we can move "struct drm_magic_entry" to
drm_auth.c and avoid exposing it to all of DRM.
