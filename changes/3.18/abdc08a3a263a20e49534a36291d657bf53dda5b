gpio: change gpiochip_request_own_desc() prototype

The current prototype of gpiochip_request_own_desc() requires to obtain
a pointer to a descriptor. This is in contradiction to all other GPIO
request schemes, and imposes an extra step of obtaining a descriptor to
drivers. Most drivers actually cannot even perform that step since the
function that does it (gpichip_get_desc()) is gpiolib-private.

Change gpiochip_request_own_desc() to return a descriptor from a
(chip, hwnum) tuple and update users of this function (currently
gpiolib-acpi only).
