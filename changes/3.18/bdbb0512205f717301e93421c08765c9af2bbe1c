staging: lustre: adjust spacing within pointer casts

The semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
type T;
expression e;
@@
 (
- T *
+ T *
 )
 e
// </smpl>

This semantic patch just removes the cast and adds it back, but when it
does so, it follows the spacing conventions of Linux.
