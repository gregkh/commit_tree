drm/i915/bdw: Apply workarounds in render ring init function

For BDW workarounds are currently initialized in init_clock_gating() but
they are lost during reset, suspend/resume etc; this patch moves the WAs
that are part of register state context to render ring init fn otherwise
default context ends up with incorrect values as they don't get initialized
until init_clock_gating fn.

v2: Add workarounds to golden render state
This method has its own issues, first of all this is different for
each gen and it is generated using a tool so adding new workaround
and mainitaining them across gens is not a straightforward process.

v3: Use LRIs to emit these workarounds (Ville)
Instead of modifying the golden render state the same LRIs are
emitted from within the driver.

v4: Use abstract name when exporting gen specific routines (Chris)
