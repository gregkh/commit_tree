gue: Receive side for Generic UDP Encapsulation

This patch adds support receiving for GUE packets in the fou module. The
fou module now supports direct foo-over-udp (no encapsulation header)
and GUE. To support this a type parameter is added to the fou netlink
parameters.

For a GUE socket we define gue_udp_recv, gue_gro_receive, and
gue_gro_complete to handle the specifics of the GUE protocol. Most
of the code to manage and configure sockets is common with the fou.
