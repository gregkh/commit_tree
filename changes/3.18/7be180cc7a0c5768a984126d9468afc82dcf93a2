Revert "mfd: wm5102: Manually apply register patch"

This reverts commit d9d03496f6f904a3588bdb8b215853bc4e50132c.

It seems this commit was applied twice, once through ASoC and once
through MFD:

commit 4c9bb8bc352a14c9613c77bc3f1e9038cd086b9b
mfd: wm5102: Manually apply register patch

commit d9d03496f6f904a3588bdb8b215853bc4e50132c
mfd: wm5102: Manually apply register patch

This has lead to a small piece of duplicate code. It is harmless hence
how it has gone unoticed for so long. This patch reverts one of the two
commits removing the unneeded code.
