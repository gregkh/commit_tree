ext4: check EA value offset when loading

When loading extended attributes, check each entry's value offset to
make sure it doesn't collide with the entries.

Without this check it is easy to crash the kernel by mounting a
malicious FS containing a file with an EA wherein e_value_offs = 0 and
e_value_size > 0 and then deleting the EA, which corrupts the name
list.

(See the f_ea_value_crash test's FS image in e2fsprogs for an example.)
