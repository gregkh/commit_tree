mfd: max77693: Fix always masked MUIC interrupts

All interrupts coming from MUIC were ignored because interrupt source
register was masked.

The Maxim 77693 has a "interrupt source" - a separate register and interrupts
which give information about PMIC block triggering the individual
interrupt (charger, topsys, MUIC, flash LED).

By default bootloader could initialize this register to "mask all"
value. In such case (observed on Trats2 board) MUIC interrupts won't be
generated regardless of their mask status. Regmap irq chip was unmasking
individual MUIC interrupts but the source was masked

Before introducing regmap irq chip this interrupt source was unmasked,
read and acked. Reading and acking is not necessary but unmasking is.
