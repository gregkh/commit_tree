zram: use notify_free to account all free notifications

`notify_free' device attribute accounts the number of slot free
notifications and internally represents the number of zram_free_page()
calls.  Slot free notifications are sent only when device is used as a
swap device, hence `notify_free' is used only for swap devices.  Since
f4659d8e620d08 (zram: support REQ_DISCARD) ZRAM handles yet another one
free notification (also via zram_free_page() call) -- REQ_DISCARD
requests, which are sent by a filesystem, whenever some data blocks are
discarded.  However, there is no way to know the number of notifications
in the latter case.

Use `notify_free' to account the number of pages freed by
zram_bio_discard() and zram_slot_free_notify().  Depending on usage
scenario `notify_free' represents:

 a) the number of pages freed because of slot free notifications, which is
   equal to the number of swap_slot_free_notify() calls, so there is no
   behaviour change

 b) the number of pages freed because of REQ_DISCARD notifications
