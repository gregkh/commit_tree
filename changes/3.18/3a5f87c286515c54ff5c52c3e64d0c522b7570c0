drm: fix plane rotation when restoring fbdev configuration

Make sure plane rotation is reset correctly when restoring the fbdev
configuration by using drm_mode_plane_set_obj_prop which calls the
driver's set_property callback.

The rotation reset feature was introduced in commit 9783de2 (drm:
Resetting rotation property) and the callback issue was originally
addressed in a previous version of the patch, but the fix was not
present in the final version.
