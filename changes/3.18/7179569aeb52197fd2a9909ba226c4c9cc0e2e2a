regulator: core: Add REGULATOR_EVENT_PRE_VOLTAGE_CHANGE (and ABORT)

In some cases we need to know when a regulator is about to be changed.
Add a way for clients to be notified.  Note that for set_voltage() we
don't necessarily know what voltage we'll end up with, so we tell the
client what the range will be so they can prepare.
