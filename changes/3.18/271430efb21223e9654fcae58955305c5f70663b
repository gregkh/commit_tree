[media] as102: remove some unneeded checks

We know "ret" is zero so we don't need to test for it.  It upsets the
static checkers when we test stuff but we know the answer.

drivers/media/usb/as102/as102_usb_drv.c:164 as102_send_ep1() warn: we tested 'ret' before and it was 'false'
drivers/media/usb/as102/as102_usb_drv.c:189 as102_read_ep2() warn: we tested 'ret' before and it was 'false'

Also, we don't need to initialize "ret".
