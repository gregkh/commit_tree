Staging: media: lirc: lirc_imon: Removed unnecessary variable to simplify return variable handling

Variable rc was removed after merging its assignment statement with
immediately following return statement. Variable retval is not used
at all other that to return its initial value.Hence replaced retval
with its initial value in the return statement and removed the variable.

This patch was done using Coccinelle script and the following semantic
patch was used:

@rule1@
identifier ret;
expression e;
@@

-int ret = 0;
 ... when != ret
(
-ret = e;
+return e;
-return ret;
|
-return ret;
+return 0;
)
