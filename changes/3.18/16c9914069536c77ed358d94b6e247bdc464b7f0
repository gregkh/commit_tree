nfs: remove spurious WARN_ON_ONCE in write path

This WARN_ON_ONCE was supposed to catch reference counting bugs, but can
trigger in inappropriate situations.

This was reproducible using NFSv2 on an architecture with 64K pages -- we
verified that it was not a reference counting bug and the warning was
safe to ignore.
