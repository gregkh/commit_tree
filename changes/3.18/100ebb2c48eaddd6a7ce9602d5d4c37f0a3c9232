PCI: Add ACS quirk for Intel 10G NICs

Intel has verified there is no peer-to-peer between functions for the below
selection of 82598, 82599, and X520 10G NICs.  These NICs lack an ACS
capability, so we're not able to determine this isolation without the help
of quirks.

Generalize the Solarflare quirk and add these Intel 10G NICs.
