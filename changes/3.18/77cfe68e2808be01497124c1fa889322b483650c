ARM: msm: Update the references to DEBUG_MSM_UARTx

The Kconfig options DEBUG_MSM_UART1, DEBUG_MSM_UART2, DEBUG_MSM_UART3,
MSM_DEBUG_UART1, MSM_DEBUG_UART2 and MSM_DEBUG_UART3 are removed, but
they are still referenced in the following files:
	arch/arm/mach-msm/io.c,
	arch/arm/mach-msm/board-trout.c
	arch/arm/mach-msm/board-trout-gpio.c

Fix this by updating the reference to the new Kconfig option.
