ARM: 8167/1: extend the reserved memory for initrd to be page aligned

This patch extends the start and end address of initrd to be page aligned,
so that we can free all memory including the un-page aligned head or tail
page of initrd, if the start or end address of initrd are not page
aligned, the page can't be freed by free_initrd_mem() function.
