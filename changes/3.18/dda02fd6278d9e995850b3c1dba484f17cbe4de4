mm, cma: make parameters order consistent in func declaration and definition

In the current code, the base and size parameters order is not consistent
in functions declaration and definition. If someone calls these functions
according to the declaration parameters order in cma.h, he will run into
some bug and it's hard to find the reason.

This patch makes the parameters order consistent in functions declaration
and definition.
