ARM: 8160/1: drop warning about return_address not using unwind tables

The warning was introduced in 2009 (commit 4bf1fa5a34aa ([ARM] 5613/1:
implement CALLER_ADDRESSx)). The only "problem" here is that
CALLER_ADDRESSx for x > 1 returns NULL which doesn't do much harm.

The drawback of implementing a fix (i.e. use unwind tables to implement CALLER_ADDRESSx) is that much of the unwinder code would need to be marked as not
traceable.
