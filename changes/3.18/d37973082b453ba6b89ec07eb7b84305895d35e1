Revert "Btrfs: race free update of commit root for ro snapshots"

This reverts commit 9c3b306e1c9e6be4be09e99a8fe2227d1005effc.

Switching only one commit root during a transaction is wrong because it
leads the fs into an inconsistent state. All commit roots should be
switched at once, at transaction commit time, otherwise backref walking
can often miss important references that were only accessible through
the old commit root.  Plus, the root item for the snapshot's root wasn't
getting updated and preventing the next transaction commit to do it.

This made several users get into random corruption issues after creation
of readonly snapshots.

A regression test for xfstests will follow soon.
