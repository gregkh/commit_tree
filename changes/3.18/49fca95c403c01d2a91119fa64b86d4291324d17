staging: comedi: cb_pcimdas: refactor iobase addresses

This driver uses three iobase addresses, found in PCI bars 2, 3, and 4.
Currently, the address in PCI bar 2 is saved in the comedi_device as
the 'iobase', the PCI bar 3 address is saved in the private data as
'BADR3' and the one in PCI bar 4 is just passed to subdev_8255_init()
as the 'iobase' parameter.

Flip the saving of the PCI bar 2 and 4 base addresses. Save the address
from PCI bar 2 in the private data as the 'daqio' and the address from
PCI bar 4 in the comedi_device as the 'iobase'.

This will help with some cleanup of the 8255 module.
