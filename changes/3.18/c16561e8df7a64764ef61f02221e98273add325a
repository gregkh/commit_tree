PM / Domains: Change prototype for the attach and detach callbacks

Convert the prototypes to return an int in order to support error
handling in these callbacks.

Also, as suggested by Dmitry Torokhov, pass the domain pointer for use
inside the callbacks, and so that they match the existing
power_on/power_off callbacks which currently take the domain pointer.
