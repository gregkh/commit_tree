ath10k: fix fw crash dumping

Recent crash dump patches introduced a regression.
If debugfs was disabled upon crash user could only
see the following:

 [  793.880000] ath10k: firmware crashed! (uuid n/a)
 [  793.890000] ath10k: qca988x hw2.0 (0x4100016c, 0x043202ff) fw 10.1.467.2-1 api 2 htt 2.1
 [  793.890000] ath10k: debug 0 debugfs 0 tracing 0 dfs 1

The report was missing register dump. Fix it by
printing registers regardless if crash_data is
present or not.
