rcu: Make TINY_RCU tinier by putting error checks under #ifdef

The rcu_idle_enter_common() and rcu_idle_exit_common() functions contain
error checks that have to the best of my knowledge have never triggered
over the past several years.  These are nevertheless valuable when
creating new architectures or doing other low-level changes, so the
checks should not be deleted.  This commit instead places these checks
under #ifdef CONFIG_RCU_TRACE so that they are executed only when
specifically requested.

The savings are significant:

	Before:

	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	   1749      39       0    1788     6fc /tmp/b/kernel/rcu/tiny.o
	    632     152       0     784     310 /tmp/b/kernel/rcu/update.o
				   ----
				   2572

	After:

	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
	   1281      37       0    1318     526 /tmp/b/kernel/rcu/tiny.o
	    632     152       0     784     310 /tmp/b/kernel/rcu/update.o
				   ----
				   2102

This amounts to 470 bytes, or 18% of the original.

Switched from #ifdef to IS_ENABLED() on Josh Triplett's advice.
