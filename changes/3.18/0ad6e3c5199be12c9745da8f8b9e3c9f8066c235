x86: Speed up ___preempt_schedule*() by using THUNK helpers

___preempt_schedule() does SAVE_ALL/RESTORE_ALL but this is
suboptimal, we do not need to save/restore the callee-saved
register. And we already have arch/x86/lib/thunk_*.S which
implements the similar asm wrappers, so it makes sense to
redefine ___preempt_schedule() as "THUNK ..." and remove
preempt.S altogether.
