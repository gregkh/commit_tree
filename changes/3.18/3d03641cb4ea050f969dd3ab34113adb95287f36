net/mlx4_en: Avoid a cache line miss in TX completion for single frag skb's

Add frag0_dma/frag0_byte_count into mlx4_en_tx_info to avoid a cache
line miss in TX completion for frames having one dma element.  (We avoid
reading back the tx descriptor)

Note this could be extended to 2/3 dma elements later, as we have free
room in mlx4_en_tx_info

Also, mlx4_en_free_tx_desc() no longer accesses skb_shinfo(). We use a
new nr_maps fields in mlx4_en_tx_info to avoid 2 or 3 cache misses.
