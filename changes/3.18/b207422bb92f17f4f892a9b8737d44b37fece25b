ARM: shmobile: kzm9g legacy: Set i2c clks_per_count to 2

On sh73a0/kzm9g-legacy, probing of the i2c masters fails with:

    i2c-sh_mobile i2c-sh_mobile.0: timing values out of range: L/H=0x208/0x1bf
    sh_mobile: probe of i2c-sh_mobile.0 failed with error -22

According to the datasheet, the transfer rate is derived from the HP
clock (which runs at 104 MHz) divided by two. Hence
i2c_sh_mobile_platform_data.clks_per_count should be set to two.

Now probing succeeds, and i2c works:

    i2c-sh_mobile i2c-sh_mobile.0: I2C adapter 0 with bus speed 100000 Hz (L/H=0x104/0xe0)
