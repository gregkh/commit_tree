i40e: quiet complaints when removing default MAC VLAN filter and make set_mac reversible

Older firmware has an incorrect MAC VLAN filter that needs to be replaced
at startup, and now newer firmware doesn't have this problem.  With this
change we no longer complain if the remove fails, and we only add the
new filter if the remove succeeded.

Setting a new LAA worked the first time, but didn't work well in successive
operations, including returning to the HW default address.  This simplifies
the code that was trying to be too smart.

Lastly, this pulls the hardware default mac address out into separate
handling code and keeps the broadcast filtering from getting munged.
