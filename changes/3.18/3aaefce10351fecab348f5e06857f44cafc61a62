x86, platform, kconfig: move kvmconfig functionality to a helper

The new mergeconfig helper makes it easier to add other partial
configurations similar to kvmconfig.  Architecture-independent portions
of those partial configurations should go in
kernel/configs/${name}.config, and architecture-dependent portions
should go in arch/${arch}/configs/${name}.config.

Based on a patch by Luis R. Rodriguez <mcgrof@suse.com>.

Modified to make the helper name more general than just virtualization,
support architecture-dependent and architecture-independent partial
configurations, move the helper and kvmconfig to
scripts/kconfig/Makefile, and factor out more of the common file path.
