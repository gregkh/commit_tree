net-timestamp: Merge shared code between phy and regular timestamping

This change merges the shared bits that exist between skb_tx_tstamp and
skb_complete_tx_timestamp.  By doing this we can avoid the two diverging as
there were already changes pushed into skb_tx_tstamp that hadn't made it
into the other function.

In addition this resolves issues with the fact that
skb_complete_tx_timestamp was included in linux/skbuff.h even though it was
only compiled in if phy timestamping was enabled.
