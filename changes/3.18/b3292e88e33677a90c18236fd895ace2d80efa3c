crash_dump: Make is_kdump_kernel() accessible from modules

In order to make is_kdump_kernel() accessible from modules, need to
make elfcorehdr_addr exported.
This was rejected in the past [1] because reset_devices was prefered in
that context (reseting the device in kdump kernel), but now there are
some network drivers that need to reduce memory usage when loaded from
a kdump kernel.  And in that context, is_kdump_kernel() suits better.
