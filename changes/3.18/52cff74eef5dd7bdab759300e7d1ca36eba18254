dcbnl : Disable software interrupts before taking dcb_lock

Solves possible lockup issues that can be seen from firmware DCB agents calling
into the DCB app api.

DCB firmware event queues can be tied in with NAPI so that dcb events are
generated in softIRQ context. This can results in calls to dcb_*app()
functions which try to take the dcb_lock.

If the the event triggers while we also have the dcb_lock because lldpad or
some other agent happened to be issuing a  get/set command we could see a cpu
lockup.

This code was not originally written with firmware agents in mind, hence
grabbing dcb_lock from softIRQ context was not considered.
