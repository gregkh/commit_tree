i2c: imx: Add arbitration lost check

According to the i.mx spec, for multimaster mode, if I2C is
enabled when the bus is busy and asserts start, hardware inhibits
the transmission, clears MSTA without signaling a stop, generate
an interrupt, and set I2C_I2SR[IAL] to indicate a failed attempt
to engage the bus, which means arbitration lost. In this case,
we should first test I2C_I2SR[IAL], and clear this bit if it is
set, and then I2C controller default to slave receive mode.

This patch check the IAL bit every time before an I2c transmission.
if IAL is set, clear it and make I2C controller to default mode.
