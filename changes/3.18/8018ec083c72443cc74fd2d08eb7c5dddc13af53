xfs: mark all internal workqueues as freezable

Workqueues must be explicitly set as freezable to ensure they are frozen
in the assocated part of the hibernation/suspend sequence. Freezing of
workqueues and kernel threads is important to ensure that modifications
are not made on-disk after the hibernation image has been created.
Otherwise, the in-memory state can become inconsistent with what is on
disk and eventually lead to filesystem corruption. We have reports of
free space btree corruptions that occur immediately after restore from
hibernate that suggest the xfs-eofblocks workqueue could be causing
such problems if it races with hibernation.

Mark all of the internal XFS workqueues as freezable to ensure nothing
changes on-disk once the freezer infrastructure freezes kernel threads
and creates the hibernation image.
