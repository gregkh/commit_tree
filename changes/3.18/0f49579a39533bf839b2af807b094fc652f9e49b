bridge: switch order of rx_handler reg and upper dev link

The thing is that netdev_master_upper_dev_link calls
call_netdevice_notifiers(NETDEV_CHANGEUPPER, dev). That generates rtnl
link message and during that, rtnl_link_ops->fill_slave_info is called.
But with current ordering, rx_handler and IFF_BRIDGE_PORT are not set
yet so there would have to be check for that in fill_slave_info callback.

Resolve this by reordering to similar what bonding and team does to
avoid the check.

Also add removal of IFF_BRIDGE_PORT flag into error path.
