ARM: OMAP2+: Add hwmod flag for HWMOD_RECONFIG_IO_CHAIN

Commit cc824534d4fe ("ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: Rearm wake-up interrupts
for DT when MUSB is idled") fixed issues with hung UART wake-up
events by calling _reconfigure_io_chain() when MUSB is connected
or disconnected.

As pointed out by Paul Walmsley, we may need to also call
_reconfigure_io_chain() in other cases, so it should be a separate
flag. Let's add HWMOD_RECONFIG_IO_CHAIN as suggested by Paul.
