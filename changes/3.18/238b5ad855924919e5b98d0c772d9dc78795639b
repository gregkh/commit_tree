staging: comedi: fix memory leak / bad pointer freeing for chanlist

As a follow-up to commit 6cab7a37f5c04 ("staging: comedi: (regression)
channel list must be set for COMEDI_CMD ioctl"), Hartley Sweeten pointed
out another couple of bugs stemming from commit 6cab7a37f5c04 ("staging:
comedi: comedi_fops: introduce __comedi_get_user_chanlist()").

Firstly, `do_cmdtest_ioctl()` never frees the kernel copy of the user
chanlist allocated by `__comedi_get_user_chanlist()`, so that memory is
leaked.  Fix it by freeing the allocated kernel memory pointed to by
`cmd.chanlist` before that pointer is overwritten with its original
pointer to user memory before `cmd` is copied back to user-space.

Secondly, if `__comedi_get_user_chanlist()` returns an error,
`cmd->chanlist` is left unchanged and in fact will be a pointer to user
memory.  This causes `do_cmd_ioctl()` to `goto cleanup` and call
`do_become_nonbusy()` which would attempt to free the memory pointed to
by the user-space pointer.  Fix it by setting `cmd->chanlist` to NULL at
the start of `__comedi_get_user_chanlist()`.
