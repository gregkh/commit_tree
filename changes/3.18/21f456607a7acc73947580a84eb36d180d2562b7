frv: remove unused cpuinfo_frv and friends to fix future build error

Frv has a macro named cpu_data, interfering with variables and struct
members with the same name:

include/linux/pm_domain.h:75:24: error: expected identifier or '('
before '&' token
  struct gpd_cpu_data *cpu_data;

As struct cpuinfo_frv, boot_cpu_data, cpu_data, and current_cpu_data are
not used, removed them to fix this.
