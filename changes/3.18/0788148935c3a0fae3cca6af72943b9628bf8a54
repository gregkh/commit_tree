ARM: exynos_defconfig: Enable max77802 rtc and clock drivers

Commit 6e80e3d87549 ("ARM: exynos_defconfig: Enable MAX77802")
enabled support for the max77802 regulators but the PMIC also
has a Real-Time-Clock (RTC) and 2-channel 32kHz clock outputs.

Enable the kernel config options to have the drivers for these
devices built-in since they are present in many Exynos boards.
