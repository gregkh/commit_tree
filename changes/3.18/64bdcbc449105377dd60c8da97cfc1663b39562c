scsi: add use_cmd_list flag

Add a use_cmd_list flag in struct Scsi_Host to request keeping track of
all outstanding commands per device.

Default behaviour is not to keep track of cmd_list per sdev, as this may
introduce lock contention. (overhead is more on multi-node NUMA.), and
only enable it on the two drivers that need it.
