clk: Remove .owner field for driver

There is no need to init .owner field.

Based on the patch from Peter Griffin <peter.griffin@linaro.org>
"mmc: remove .owner field for drivers using module_platform_driver"

This patch removes the superflous .owner field for drivers which
use the module_platform_driver API, as this is overriden in
platform_driver_register anyway."
