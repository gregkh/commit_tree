mtd: denali: fix the format of comment blocks

We should use
/*
 * Blah Blah ...
 * ...
 */

for multi-line comment blocks.

In addition, refactor some comments where it seems reasonable and
remove some comments where the code is clear enough such as:

    /* clear interrupts */
    clear_interrupts(denali);
