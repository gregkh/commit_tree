drm/i915: Add temporary ring->ctx backpointer

The execlist patches have a bit a convoluted and long history and due
to that have the actual submission still misplaced deeply burried in
the low-level ringbuffer handling code. This design goes back to the
legacy ringbuffer code with its tricky lazy request and simple work
submissiion using ring tail writes. For that reason they need a
ring->ctx backpointer.

The goal is to unburry that code and move it up into a level where the
full execlist context is available so that we can ditch this
backpointer. Until that's done make it really obvious that there's
work still to be done.
