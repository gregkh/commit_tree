staging: comedi: skel: use comedi_subdevice 'readback'

Use the new comedi_subdevice 'readback' member and the core provided
(*insn_read) for the readback of the analog output subdevice channels.

For aesthetics, rename the (*insn_write) function and tidy it up a bit.

Add a comment about the 'readback' member.
