drm: Use vblank_disable_and_save in drm_vblank_cleanup()

Calling vblank_disable_fn() will cause that function to no-op
if !dev->vblank_disable_allowed for some kms drivers, e.g.,
on nouveau-kms. This can cause the gpu vblank irq's to not get
disabled before freeing the dev->vblank array, so if a
vblank irq fires and calls into drm_handle_vblank() after
drm_vblank_cleanup() completes, it will cause use-after-free
access to dev->vblank array.

Call vblank_disable_and_save unconditionally, so vblank irqs
are guaranteed to be off, before we delete the data structures
on which they operate.
