btrfs: add more superblock checks

Populate btrfs_check_super_valid() with checks that try to verify
consistency of superblock by additional conditions that may arise from
corrupted devices or bitflips. Some of tests are only hints and issue
warnings instead of failing the mount, basically when the checks are
derived from the data found in the superblock.

Tested on a broken image provided by Qu.
