drm/i915/hdmi: Cache EDID for a detection cycle

As we may query the edid multiple times following a detect, record the
EDID found during output discovery and reuse it. This is a separate
issue from caching the output EDID across detection cycles.

v2: Also hookup the force() callback for audio detection when the user
forces the connection status.
v3: Ville spots a typo, s/==/!=/
