jbd2: optimize jbd2_log_do_checkpoint() a bit

When we discover written out buffer in transaction checkpoint list we
don't have to recheck validity of a transaction. Either this is the
last buffer in a transaction - and then we are done - or this isn't
and then we can just take another buffer from the checkpoint list
without dropping j_list_lock.
