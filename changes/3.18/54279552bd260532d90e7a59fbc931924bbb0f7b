x86/core, x86/xen/smp: Use 'die_complete' completion when taking CPU down

Commit 2ed53c0d6cc9 ("x86/smpboot: Speed up suspend/resume by
avoiding 100ms sleep for CPU offline during S3") introduced
completions to CPU offlining process. These completions are not
initialized on Xen kernels causing a panic in
play_dead_common().

Move handling of die_complete into common routines to make them
available to Xen guests.
