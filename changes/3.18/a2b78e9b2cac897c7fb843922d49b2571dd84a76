sunvnet: generate ICMP PTMUD messages for smaller port MTUs

This patch sends ICMP and ICMPv6 messages for Path MTU Discovery when a remote
port MTU is smaller than the device MTU. This allows mixing newer VIO protocol
devices that support MTU negotiation with older devices that do not on the
same vswitch. It also allows Linux-Linux LDOMs to use 64K-1 data packets even
though Solaris vswitch is limited to <16K MTU.
