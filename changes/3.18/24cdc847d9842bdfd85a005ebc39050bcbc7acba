Btrfs: unlock nodes earlier when inserting items in a btree

In ctree.c:setup_items_for_insert(), we can unlock all nodes in our
path before we process the leaf (shift items and data, adjust data
offsets, etc). This allows for better btree concurrency, as we're
often holding a write lock on at least the node at level 1.
