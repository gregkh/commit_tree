sched/numa: Avoid selecting oneself as swap target

Because the whole numa task selection stuff runs with preemption
enabled (its long and expensive) we can end up migrating and selecting
oneself as a swap target. This doesn't really work out well -- we end
up trying to acquire the same lock twice for the swap migrate -- so
avoid this.
