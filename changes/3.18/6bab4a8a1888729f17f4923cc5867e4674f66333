clockevent: sun4i: Fix race condition in the probe code

The interrupts were activated and the handler registered before the clockevent
was registered in the probe function.

The interrupt handler, however, was making the assumption that the clockevent
device was registered.

That could cause a null pointer dereference if the timer interrupt was firing
during this narrow window.

Fix that by moving the clockevent registration before the interrupt is enabled.
