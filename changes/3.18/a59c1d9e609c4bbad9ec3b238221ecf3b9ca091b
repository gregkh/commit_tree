powerpc/kvm: support to handle sw breakpoint

This patch adds kernel side support for software breakpoint.
Design is that, by using an illegal instruction, we trap to hypervisor
via Emulation Assistance interrupt, where we check for the illegal instruction
and accordingly we return to Host or Guest. Patch also adds support for
software breakpoint in PR KVM.
