drivers: staging: lustre: fix sparse warnings / delete unused function

drivers: staging: lustre: fix sparse warning: symbol XYZ was
not declared. Should it be static?

This was done by declaring them static. This could be done because the functions
were used only in this file.

Deleted the function lnet_print_text_bufs because it were unused.

Compiled without an error.
Done to complete a eudyptula task.
