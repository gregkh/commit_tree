kexec: check if crashk_res_low exists when exclude it from crash mem ranges

Add a check if crashk_res_low exists just like GART region does.  If
crashk_res_low doesn't exist, calling exclude_mem_range is unnecessary.

Meanwhile, since crashk_res_low has been initialized at definition, it's
safe just use "if (crashk_low_res.end)" to check if it's exist.  And this
can make it consistent with other places of check.
