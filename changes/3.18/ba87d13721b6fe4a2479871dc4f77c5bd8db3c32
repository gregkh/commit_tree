dma: mv_xor: Reduce interrupts by enabling EOD only when needed

This commit unmasks the end-of-chain interrupt and removes the
end-of-descriptor command setting on all transactions, except those
explicitly flagged with DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT.

This allows to raise an interrupt only on chain completion, instead of
on each descriptor completion, which reduces interrupt count.
