staging: rtl8192ee: Fix RT_TRACE #define and uses

RT_TRACE uses require unnecessary parentheses.

Fix the #define and remove the uses.

Neaten the RT_TRACE lines and multi-line argument wrapping.

dynamic debug can add KBUILD_MODNAME and __func__ so remove those
from the #define.

Use a single statement pr_debug instead of pr_debug and pr_cont
which doesn't support dynamic debug anyway.

Miscellaneous grammar and spelling fixes on the RT_TRACE uses.

Compile tested only.
