drm/i915: honour forced connector modes

In the move over to use BIOS connector configs, we lost the ability to
force a specific set of connectors on or off.  Try to remedy that by
dropping back to the old behavior if we detect a hard coded connector
config that tries to enable a connector (disabling is easy!).

Based on earlier patches by Jesse Barnes.

v2: Remove Jesse's patch
