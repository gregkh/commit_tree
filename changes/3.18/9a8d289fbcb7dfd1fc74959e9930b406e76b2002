ima: fix ima_alloc_atfm()

The patch 3bcced39ea7d: "ima: use ahash API for file hash
calculation" from Feb 26, 2014, leads to the following static checker
warning:

security/integrity/ima/ima_crypto.c:204 ima_alloc_atfm()
         error: buffer overflow 'hash_algo_name' 17 <= 17

Unlike shash tfm memory, which is allocated on initialization, the
ahash tfm memory allocation is deferred until needed.

This patch fixes the case where ima_ahash_tfm has not yet been
allocated and the file's signature/hash xattr contains an invalid hash
algorithm.  Although we can not verify the xattr, we still need to
measure the file.  Use the default IMA hash algorithm.

Changelog:
- set valid algo before testing tfm - based on Dmitry's comment
