ARM: exynos: Move to generic PM domain DT bindings

This patch moves Exynos PM domain code to use the new generic PM domain
look-up framework introduced in previous patches, thus also allowing
the new code to be compiled with CONFIG_ARCH_EXYNOS.

This patch was originally submitted by Tomasz Figa when he was employed
by Samsung.
