EEPROM: Introduce the use of devm_kzalloc

This patch introduces the use of devm_kzalloc and does away with the
kfrees in the probe and remove functions. Also, a label and the err
variable are removed. The header device.h is included to make the devm_
function explicitly available and slab.h is done away with as it is no
longer needed.
