  drm/exynos/fbdev: don't set fix.smem/mmio_{start,len}

However, smem_len is used by some userland applications to calculate the
size for mmap.  In particular, it is used by xf86-video-fbdev:

http://cgit.freedesktop.org/xorg/xserver/tree/hw/xfree86/fbdevhw/fbdevhw.c?id=xorg-server-1.15.99.903#n571

So, let's restore setting the smem_len to unbreak things for these users.

Note: we are still leaving smem_start set to 0.
