drm/i915: Check for a stalled page flip after each vblank

Long ago, back in the racy haydays of 915gm interrupt handling, page
flips would occasionally go astray and leave the hardware stuck, and the
display not updating. This annoyed people who relied on their systems
being able to display continuously updating information 24/7, and so
some code to detect when the driver missed the page flip completion
signal was added. Until recently, it was presumed that the interrupt
handling was now flawless, but once again Simon Farnsworth has found a
system whose display will stall. Reinstate the pageflip stall detection,
which works by checking to see if the hardware has been updated to the
new framebuffer address following each vblank. If the hardware is
scanning out from the new framebuffer, but we still think the flip is
pending, then we kick our driver into submision.

This is a continuation of the effort started with

    drm/i915: Avoid pageflipping freeze when we miss the flip prepare interrupt

This now includes a belt-and-braces approach to make sure the driver
(or the hardware) doesn't miss an interrupt and cause us to stop
updating the display should the unthinkable happen and the pageflip fail - i.e.
that the user is able to continue submitting flips.

v2: Cleanup, refactor, and rename
v3: Only start counting vblanks after the flip command has been seen by
    the hardware.
v4: Record the seqno after we touch the ring, or else there may be no
    seqno allocated yet.
v5: Rebase on mmio-flip.
v6: Rebase, rebase.
