Btrfs: Fix the problem that the dirty flag of dev stats is cleared

The io error might happen during writing out the device stats, and the
device stats information and dirty flag would be update at that time,
but the current code didn't consider this case, just clear the dirty
flag, it would cause that we forgot to write out the new device stats
information. Fix it.
