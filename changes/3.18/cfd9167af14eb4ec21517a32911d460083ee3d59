rt2x00: do not align payload on modern H/W

RT2800 and newer hardware require padding between header and payload if
header length is not multiple of 4.

For historical reasons we also align payload to to 4 bytes boundary, but
such alignment is not needed on modern H/W.

Patch fixes skb_under_panic problems reported from time to time:

Panic happened because we eat 4 bytes of skb headroom on each
(re)transmission when sending frame without the payload and the header
length not being multiple of 4 (i.e. QoS header has 26 bytes). On such
case because paylad_aling=2 is bigger than header_align=0 we increase
header_align by 4 bytes. To prevent that we could change the check to:

	if (payload_length && payload_align > header_align)
		header_align += 4;

but not aligning payload at all is more effective and alignment is not
really needed by H/W (that has been tested on OpenWrt project for few
years now).
