tun: Fix csum_start with VLAN acceleration

When VLAN acceleration is in use on the xmit path, we end up
setting csum_start to the wrong place.  The result is that the
whoever ends up doing the checksum setting will corrupt the packet
instead of writing the checksum to the expected location, usually
this means writing the checksum with an offset of -4.

This patch fixes this by adjusting csum_start when VLAN acceleration
is detected.
