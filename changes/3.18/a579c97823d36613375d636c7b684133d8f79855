Staging: media: lirc: Merge two lines and remove unused variable

This patch merges an assignment with an immediately following return of
the assigned variable. It also removes a variable that becomes unused due to this transformation.
The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used to make this transformation:

@r@
identifier ret;
identifier f;
@@

-ret =
+return
     f(...);
-return ret;

@@
identifier r.ret;
expression e1;
type t;
@@

(
-t ret = e1;
|
-t ret;
)
 ... when != ret
     when strict
