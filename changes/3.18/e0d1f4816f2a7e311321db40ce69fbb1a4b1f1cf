can: m_can: add Bosch M_CAN controller support

The patch adds the basic CAN TX/RX function support for Bosch M_CAN controller.
For TX, only one dedicated tx buffer is used for sending data.
For RX, RXFIFO 0 is used for receiving data to avoid overflow.
Rx FIFO 1 and Rx Buffers are not used currently, as well as Tx Event FIFO.

Due to the message ram can be shared by multi m_can instances
and the fifo element is configurable which is SoC dependant,
the design is to parse the message ram related configuration data from device
tree rather than hardcode define it in driver which can make the message
ram sharing fully transparent to M_CAN controller driver,
then we can gain better driver maintainability and future features upgrade.

M_CAN also supports CANFD protocol features like data payload up to 64 bytes
and bitrate switch at runtime, however, this patch still does not add the
support for these features.
