serial: core: Privatize modem status enable flags

The serial core uses the tty port flags, ASYNC_CTS_FLOW and
ASYNC_CD_CHECK, to track whether CTS and DCD changes should be
ignored or handled. However, the tty port flags are not safe for
atomic bit operations and no lock provides serialized updates.

Introduce the struct uart_port status field to track CTS and DCD
enable states, and serialize access with uart port lock. Substitute
uart_cts_enabled() helper for tty_port_cts_enabled().
