mmc: implement Driver Stage Register handling

Some eMMC and SD cards implement a DSR register that allows to tune
raise/fall times and drive strength of the CMD and DATA outputs.
The values to use depend on the card in use and the host.
It might be needed to reduce the drive strength to prevent voltage peaks
above the host's specification.

Implement a 'dsr' devicetree property that allows to specify the value
to set the DSR to. For non-dt setups the new members of mmc_host can be
set by board code.
