x86: Axe the lightly-used cpu_has_pae

cpu_has_pae is only referenced in one place: the X86_32 kexec
code (in a file not even built on 64-bit).  It hardly warrants
its own macro, or the trouble we go to ensuring that it can't
be called in X86_64 code.

Axe the macro and replace it with a direct cpu feature check.
