NFC: nci: Add support for proprietary RF Protocols

In NFC Forum NCI specification, some RF Protocol values are
reserved for proprietary use (from 0x80 to 0xfe).
Some CLF vendor may need to use one value within this range
for specific technology.
Furthermore, some CLF may not becompliant with NFC Froum NCI
specification 2.0 and therefore will not support RF Protocol
value 0x06 for PROTOCOL_T5T as mention in a draft specification
and in a recent push.

Adding get_rf_protocol handle to the nci_ops structure will
help to set the correct technology to target.
