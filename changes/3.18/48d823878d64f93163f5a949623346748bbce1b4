drm/i915/bdw: Generic logical ring init and cleanup

Allocate and populate the default LRC for every ring, call
gen-specific init/cleanup, init/fini the command parser and
set the status page (now inside the LRC object). These are
things all engines/rings have in common.

Stopping the ring before cleanup and initializing the seqnos
is left as a TODO task (we need more infrastructure in place
before we can achieve this).

v2: Check the ringbuffer backing obj for ring_is_initialized,
instead of the context backing obj (similar, but not exactly
the same).
