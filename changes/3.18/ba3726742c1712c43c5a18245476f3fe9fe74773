xfs: check xfs_buf_read_uncached returns correctly

xfs_buf_read_uncached() has two failure modes. If can either return
NULL or bp->b_error != 0 depending on the type of failure, and not
all callers check for both. Fix it so that xfs_buf_read_uncached()
always returns the error status, and the buffer is returned as a
function parameter. The buffer will only be returned on success.
