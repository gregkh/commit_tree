bnx2x: Add a fallback multi-function mode NPAR1.5

When using new Multi-function modes it's possible that due to incompatible
configuration management FW will fallback into an existing mode.

Notice that at the moment this fallback is exactly the same as the already
existing switch-independent multi-function mode, but we still use existing
infrastructure to hold this information [in case some small differences will
arise in the future].
