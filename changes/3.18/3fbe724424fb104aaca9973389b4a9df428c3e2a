mm: memcontrol: simplify detecting when the memory+swap limit is hit

When attempting to charge pages, we first charge the memory counter and
then the memory+swap counter.  If one of the counters is at its limit, we
enter reclaim, but if it's the memory+swap counter, reclaim shouldn't swap
because that wouldn't change the situation.  However, if the counters have
the same limits, we never get to the memory+swap limit.  To know whether
reclaim should swap or not, there is a state flag that indicates whether
the limits are equal and whether hitting the memory limit implies hitting
the memory+swap limit.

Just try the memory+swap counter first.
