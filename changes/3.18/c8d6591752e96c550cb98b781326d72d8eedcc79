mac80211: support DTPC IE (from Cisco Client eXtensions)

Linux already supports 802.11h, where the access point can tell the
client to reduce its transmission power. However, 802.11h is only
defined for 5 GHz, where the need for this is much smaller than on
2.4 GHz.

Cisco has their own solution, called DTPC (Dynamic Transmit Power
Control). Cisco APs on a controller sometimes but not always send
802.11h; they always send DTPC, even on 2.4 GHz. This patch adds support
for parsing and honoring the DTPC IE in addition to the 802.11h
element (they do not always contain the same limits, so both must
be honored); the format is not documented, but very simple.

Tested (on top of wireless.git and on 3.16.1) against a Cisco Aironet
1142 joined to a Cisco 2504 WLC, by setting various transmit power
levels for the given access points and observing the results.
The Wireshark 802.11 dissector agrees with the interpretation of the
element, except for negative numbers, which seem to never happen
anyway.
