hwrng: pseries - port to new read API and fix stack corruption

The add_early_randomness() function in drivers/char/hw_random/core.c passes
a 16-byte buffer to pseries_rng_data_read(). Unfortunately, plpar_hcall()
returns four 64-bit values and trashes 16 bytes on the stack.

This bug has been lying around for a long time. It got unveiled by:

commit d3cc7996473a7bdd33256029988ea690754e4e2a

    hwrng: fetch randomness only after device init

It may trig a oops while loading or unloading the pseries-rng module for both
PowerVM and PowerKVM guests.

This patch does two things:
- pass an intermediate well sized buffer to plpar_hcall(). This is acceptalbe
  since we're not on a hot path.
- move to the new read API so that we know the return buffer size for sure.
