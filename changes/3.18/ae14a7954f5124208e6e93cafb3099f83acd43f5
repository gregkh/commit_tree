tty: serial: 8250_core: provide a function to export uart_8250_port

There is no way to access a struct uart_8250_port for a specific
line. This is only required outside of the 8250/uart callbacks like for
devices' suspend & remove callbacks. For those the 8250-core provides a
wrapper like serial8250_unregister_port() which passes the struct
to the proper function based on the line argument.

For run time suspend I need access to this struct not only to make
serial_out() work but also to properly restore up->ier and up->mcr.
