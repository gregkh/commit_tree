mac80211: minstrel_ht: fix a crash in rate sorting

The commit 5935839ad73583781b8bbe8d91412f6826e218a4
"mac80211: improve minstrel_ht rate sorting by throughput & probability"

introduced a crash on rate sorting that occurs when the rate added to
the sorting array is faster than all the previous rates. Due to an
off-by-one error, it reads the rate index from tp_list[-1], which
contains uninitialized stack garbage, and then uses the resulting index
for accessing the group rate stats, leading to a crash if the garbage
value is big enough.
