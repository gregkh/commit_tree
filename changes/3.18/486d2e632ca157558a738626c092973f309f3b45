virtio_balloon: enable VQs early on restore

virtio spec requires drivers to set DRIVER_OK before using VQs.
This is set automatically after resume returns, virtio balloon
violated this rule by adding bufs, which causes the VQ to be used
directly within restore.

To fix, call virtio_device_ready before using VQ.
