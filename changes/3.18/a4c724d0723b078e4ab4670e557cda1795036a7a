platform: hp_accel: add a i8042 filter to remove HPQ6000 data from kb bus stream

Add a i8042 filter to hp_accel to remove accelerometer's data with acpi
id HPQ6000 from keyboard bus stream. The codes sent by accelerometer are
e0 25, e0 26, e0 27 and e0 28. The relevant information is already
passed through /dev/freefall so no need to send these undocumented weird
signals through the keyboard bus. Also, unclogs `dmesg` because atkbd
complained about weird scan codes, saves processing power and disk
space.
