percpu_ref: add PERCPU_REF_INIT_* flags

With the recent addition of percpu_ref_reinit(), percpu_ref now can be
used as a persistent switch which can be turned on and off repeatedly
where turning off maps to killing the ref and waiting for it to drain;
however, there currently isn't a way to initialize a percpu_ref in its
off (killed and drained) state, which can be inconvenient for certain
persistent switch use cases.

Similarly, percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic/percpu() allow dynamic
selection of operation mode; however, currently a newly initialized
percpu_ref is always in percpu mode making it impossible to avoid the
latency overhead of switching to atomic mode.

This patch adds @flags to percpu_ref_init() and implements the
following flags.

* PERCPU_REF_INIT_ATOMIC	: start ref in atomic mode
* PERCPU_REF_INIT_DEAD		: start ref killed and drained

These flags should be able to serve the above two use cases.

v2: target_core_tpg.c conversion was missing.  Fixed.
