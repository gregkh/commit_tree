powerpc/numa: ensure per-cpu NUMA mappings are correct on topology update

We received a report of warning in kernel/sched/core.c where the sched
group was NULL on an LPAR after a topology update. This seems to occur
because after the topology update has moved the CPUs, cpu_to_node is
returning the old value still, which ends up breaking the consistency of
the NUMA topology in the per-cpu maps. Ensure that we update the per-cpu
fields when we re-map CPUs.
