toshiba_acpi: Unify return codes prefix from HCI/SCI to TOS

The return codes are split in between HCI/SCI prefixes,
but they are shared (used) by both interfaces, mixing
hci_read/write calls with SCI_* return codes, and
sci_read/write calls with HCI_* ones.

This patch changes the prefix of the return codes
definitions, dropping the HCI/SCI naming and instead
replacing it with TOS (for TOShiba).
