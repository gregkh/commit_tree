of/selftest: Test structure of device tree

Add a testcase to verify that the device tree is properly constructed
and the lists are in a correct order. The new testcase gets run twice;
once after adding the testcase data, and once after removing it again.
It is run twice to make sure adding and removing the testcase data
doesn't corrupt the data structure.
