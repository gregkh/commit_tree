udp: Generalize skb_udp_segment

skb_udp_segment is the function called from udp4_ufo_fragment to
segment a UDP tunnel packet. This function currently assumes
segmentation is transparent Ethernet bridging (i.e. VXLAN
encapsulation). This patch generalizes the function to
operate on either Ethertype or IP protocol.

The inner_protocol field must be set to the protocol of the inner
header. This can now be either an Ethertype or an IP protocol
(in a union). A new flag in the skbuff indicates which type is
effective. skb_set_inner_protocol and skb_set_inner_ipproto
helper functions were added to set the inner_protocol. These
functions are called from the point where the tunnel encapsulation
is occuring.

When skb_udp_tunnel_segment is called, the function to segment the
inner packet is selected based on the inner IP or Ethertype. In the
case of an IP protocol encapsulation, the function is derived from
inet[6]_offloads. In the case of Ethertype, skb->protocol is
set to the inner_protocol and skb_mac_gso_segment is called. (GRE
currently does this, but it might be possible to lookup the protocol
in offload_base and call the appropriate segmenation function
directly).
