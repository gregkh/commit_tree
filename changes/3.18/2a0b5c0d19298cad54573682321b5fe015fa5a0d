arm64: Align less than PAGE_SIZE pgds naturally

When the pgd size is smaller than PAGE_SIZE, pgd_alloc() uses kzalloc()
to save space. However, this is not always naturally aligned as required
by the architecture. This patch creates a kmem_cache for pgd allocations
with the correct alignment.

The current kernel configurations with 4K pages + 39-bit VA and 64K
pages + 42-bit VA use a full page for the pgd and are not affected. The
patch is required for 48-bit VA with 64K pages where the pgd is 512
bytes.
