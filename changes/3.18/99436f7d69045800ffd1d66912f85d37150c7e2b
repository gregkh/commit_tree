MIPS: jump_label.c: Correct the span of the J instruction

Correct the check for the span of the 256MB segment addressable by the J
instruction according to this instruction's semantics.  The calculation
of the jump target is applied to the address of the delay-slot
instruction that immediately follows.  Adjust the check accordingly by
adding 4 to `e->code' that holds the address of the J instruction
itself.
