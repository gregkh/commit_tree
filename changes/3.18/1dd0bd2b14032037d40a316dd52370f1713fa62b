tipc: introduce new function tipc_msg_create()

The function tipc_msg_init() has turned out to be of limited value
in many cases. It take too few parameters to be usable for creating
a complete message, it makes too many assumptions about what the
message should be used for, and it does not allocate any buffer to
be returned to the caller.

Therefore, we now introduce the new function tipc_msg_create(), which
takes all the parameters needed to create a full message, and returns
a buffer of the requested size. The new function will be very useful
for the changes we will be doing in later commits in this series.
