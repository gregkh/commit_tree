ip6_tunnel: Use ip6_tnl_dev_init as the ndo_init function.

ip6_tnl_dev_init() sets the dev->iflink via a call to
ip6_tnl_link_config(). After that, register_netdevice()
sets dev->iflink = -1. So we loose the iflink configuration
for ipv6 tunnels. Fix this by using ip6_tnl_dev_init() as the
ndo_init function. Then ip6_tnl_dev_init() is called after
dev->iflink is set to -1 from register_netdevice().
