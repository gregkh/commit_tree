Smack: handle zero-length security labels without panic

Zero-length security labels are invalid but kernel should handle them.

This patch fixes kernel panic after setting zero-length security labels:
# attr -S -s "SMACK64" -V "" file

And after writing zero-length string into smackfs files syslog and onlycp:
# python -c 'import os; os.write(1, "")' > /smack/syslog

The problem is caused by brain-damaged logic in function smk_parse_smack()
which takes pointer to buffer and its length but if length below or equal zero
it thinks that the buffer is zero-terminated. Unfortunately callers of this
function are widely used and proper fix requires serious refactoring.
