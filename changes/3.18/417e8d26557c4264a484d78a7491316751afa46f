rcu: Eliminate redundant rcu_sysidle_state variable

Now that we have rcu_state_p, which references rcu_preempt_state for
TREE_PREEMPT_RCU and rcu_sched_state for TREE_RCU, we don't need a
separate rcu_sysidle_state variable.  This commit therefore eliminates
rcu_preempt_state in favor of rcu_state_p.
