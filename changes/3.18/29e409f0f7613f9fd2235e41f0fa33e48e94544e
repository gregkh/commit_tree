xhci: Allow xHCI drivers to be built as separate modules

Instead of building all of the xHCI code into a single module, separate
it out into the core (xhci-hcd), PCI (xhci-pci, now selected by the new
config option CONFIG_USB_XHCI_PCI), and platform (xhci-plat) drivers.
Also update the PCI/platform drivers with module descriptions/licenses
and have them register their respective drivers in their initcalls.
