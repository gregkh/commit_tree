[media] s2255drv: fix sparse warning

drivers/media/usb/s2255/s2255drv.c:2248:20: warning: cast to restricted __le16

At the USB structs there are two different idProduct:
	usb_device_id::idProduct - already on CPU endiannes
	usb_device::descriptor.idProduct - with is LE16

In this specific case, the driver checks for the one at usb_device_id
struct, with already have CPU endianness. So, no conversion is required.
