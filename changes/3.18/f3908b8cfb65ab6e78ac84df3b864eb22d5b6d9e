perf/x86: Don't mark DataLA addresses as store

Haswell supports reporting the data address for a range
of PEBS events, including:

	UOPS_RETIRED.ALL
	MEM_UOPS_RETIRED.STLB_MISS_LOADS
	MEM_UOPS_RETIRED.STLB_MISS_STORES
	MEM_UOPS_RETIRED.LOCK_LOADS
	MEM_UOPS_RETIRED.SPLIT_LOADS
	MEM_UOPS_RETIRED.SPLIT_STORES
	MEM_UOPS_RETIRED.ALL_LOADS
	MEM_UOPS_RETIRED.ALL_STORES
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L1_HIT
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L2_HIT
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L3_HIT
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L1_MISS
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L2_MISS
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.L3_MISS
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_RETIRED.HIT_LFB
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_MISS
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_HIT
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_HITM
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_HIT_RETIRED.XSNP_NONE
	MEM_LOAD_UOPS_L3_MISS_RETIRED.LOCAL_DRAM

This facility was already enabled earlier with the original Haswell
perf changes.

However these addresses were always reports as stores by perf, which is wrong,
as they could be loads too.  The hardware does not distinguish loads and stores
for these instructions, so there's no (cheap) way for the profiler
to find out.

Change the type to PERF_MEM_OP_NA instead.
