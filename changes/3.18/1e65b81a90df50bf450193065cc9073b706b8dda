crypto: sha-mb - multibuffer crypto infrastructure

This patch introduces the multi-buffer crypto daemon which is responsible
for submitting crypto jobs in a work queue to the responsible multi-buffer
crypto algorithm.  The idea of the multi-buffer algorihtm is to put
data streams from multiple jobs in a wide (AVX2) register and then
take advantage of SIMD instructions to do crypto computation on several
buffers simultaneously.

The multi-buffer crypto daemon is also responsbile for flushing the
remaining buffers to complete the computation if no new buffers arrive
for a while.
