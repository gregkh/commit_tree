scsi: don't store LUN bits in CDB[1] for USB mass-storage devices

The SCSI specification requires that the second Command Data Byte
should contain the LUN value in its high-order bits if the recipient
device reports SCSI level 2 or below.  Nevertheless, some USB
mass-storage devices use those bits for other purposes in
vendor-specific commands.  Currently Linux has no way to send such
commands, because the SCSI stack always overwrites the LUN bits.

Testing shows that Windows 7 and XP do not store the LUN bits in the
CDB when sending commands to a USB device.  This doesn't matter if the
device uses the Bulk-Only or UAS transports (which virtually all
modern USB mass-storage devices do), as these have a separate
mechanism for sending the LUN value.

Therefore this patch introduces a flag in the Scsi_Host structure to
inform the SCSI midlayer that a transport does not require the LUN
bits to be stored in the CDB, and it makes usb-storage set this flag
for all devices using the Bulk-Only transport.  (UAS is handled by a
separate driver, but it doesn't really matter because no SCSI-2 or
lower device is at all likely to use UAS.)

The patch also cleans up the code responsible for storing the LUN
value by adding a bitflag to the scsi_device structure.  The test for
whether to stick the LUN value in the CDB can be made when the device
is probed, and stored for future use rather than being made over and
over in the fast path.
