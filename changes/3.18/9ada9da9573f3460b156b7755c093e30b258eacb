zram: zram memory size limitation

Since zram has no control feature to limit memory usage, it makes hard to
manage system memrory.

This patch adds new knob "mem_limit" via sysfs to set up the a limit so
that zram could fail allocation once it reaches the limit.

In addition, user could change the limit in runtime so that he could
manage the memory more dynamically.

Initial state is no limit so it doesn't break old behavior.
