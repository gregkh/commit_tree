pwm: fsl-ftm: Convert to direct regmap API usage

The regmap core supports different endian modes for devices. This patch
convert to direct regmap API usage, preparing to support big endianness
for LS1 SoC.

Using the regmap framework it will be easy to support devices that only
differ in endianness with the same device driver.
