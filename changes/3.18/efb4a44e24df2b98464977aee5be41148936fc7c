ARM: dts: socfpga: Add a 3.3V fixed regulator node

Without the 3.3V regulator node, the SDMMC driver will give these warnings:

dw_mmc ff704000.dwmmc0: No vmmc regulator found
dw_mmc ff704000.dwmmc0: No vqmmc regulator found

This patch adds the regulator node, and points the SD/MMC to the regulator.

v3: Rename nodes to have schematic-name_regulator and remove "boot-on" and
    "always-on"
v2: Move the regulator nodes to their respective board dts file and
    correctly rename them to match the schematic
