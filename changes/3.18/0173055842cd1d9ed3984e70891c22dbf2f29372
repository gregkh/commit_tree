mmc: dw_mmc: Support voltage changes

For UHS cards we need the ability to switch voltages from 3.3V to
1.8V.  Add support to the dw_mmc driver to handle this.  Note that
dw_mmc needs a little bit of extra code since the interface needs a
special bit programmed to the CMD register while CMD11 is progressing.
This means adding a few extra states to the state machine to track.
