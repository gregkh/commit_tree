jbd2: don't call get_bh() before calling __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint()

The __jbd2_journal_remove_checkpoint() doesn't require an elevated
b_count; indeed, until the jh structure gets released by the call to
jbd2_journal_put_journal_head(), the bh's b_count is elevated by
virtue of the existence of the jh structure.
