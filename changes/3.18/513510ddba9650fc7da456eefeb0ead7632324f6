common: dma-mapping: introduce common remapping functions

For architectures without coherent DMA, memory for DMA may need to be
remapped with coherent attributes.  Factor out the the remapping code from
arm and put it in a common location to reduce code duplication.

As part of this, the arm APIs are now migrated away from
ioremap_page_range to the common APIs which use map_vm_area for remapping.
 This should be an equivalent change and using map_vm_area is more correct
as ioremap_page_range is intended to bring in io addresses into the cpu
space and not regular kernel managed memory.
