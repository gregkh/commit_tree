mm/cma: fix cma bitmap aligned mask computing

The current cma bitmap aligned mask computation is incorrect.  It could
cause an unexpected alignment when using cma_alloc() if the wanted align
order is larger than cma->order_per_bit.

Take kvm for example (PAGE_SHIFT = 12), kvm_cma->order_per_bit is set to
6.  When kvm_alloc_rma() tries to alloc kvm_rma_pages, it will use 15 as
the expected align value.  After using the current implementation however,
we get 0 as cma bitmap aligned mask other than 511.

This patch fixes the cma bitmap aligned mask calculation.
