xfs: bulkstat doesn't release AGI buffer on error

The recent refactoring of the bulkstat code left a small landmine in
the code. If a inobt read fails, then the tree walk is aborted and
returns without releasing the AGI buffer or freeing the cursor. This
can lead to a subsequent bulkstat call hanging trying to grab the
AGI buffer again.
