virtio-blk: drop config_mutex

config_mutex served two purposes: prevent multiple concurrent config
change handlers, and synchronize access to config_enable flag.

Since commit dbf2576e37da0fcc7aacbfbb9fd5d3de7888a3c1
    workqueue: make all workqueues non-reentrant
all workqueues are non-reentrant, and config_enable
is now gone.

Get rid of the unnecessary lock.
