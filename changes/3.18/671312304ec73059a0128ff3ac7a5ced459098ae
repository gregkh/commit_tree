um: remove csum_partial_copy_generic_i386 to clean up exception table

arch/x86/um/checksum_32.S had been copy & paste from x86. When build
x86 uml, csum_partial_copy_generic_i386 mess up the exception table.
In fact, exception table dose not work in uml kernel.

And csum_partial_copy_generic_i386 never been called. So, delete it.
