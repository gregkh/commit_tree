lib80211: remove unused print_ssid()

In kernel we have %*pE specifier to print an escaped buffer.  All users
now switched to that approach.

This fixes a bug as well.  The current implementation wrongly prints
octal numbers: only two first digits are used in case when 3 are
required and the rest of the string ends up cut off.

Additionally by default the \f, \v, \a, and \e are escaped to their
alphabetic representation.  It's safe to do since it is currently used
for messaging only.
