net: ethtool: Return -EOPNOTSUPP if user space tries to read EEPROM with lengh 0

If a driver supports reading EEPROM but no EEPROM is installed in the system,
the driver's get_eeprom_len function returns 0. ethtool will subsequently
try to read that zero-length EEPROM anyway. If the driver does not support
EEPROM access at all, this operation will return -EOPNOTSUPP. If the driver
does support EEPROM access but no EEPROM is installed, the operation will
return -EINVAL. Return -EOPNOTSUPP in both cases for consistency.
