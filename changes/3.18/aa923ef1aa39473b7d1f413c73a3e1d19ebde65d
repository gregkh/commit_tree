usb: Rename usb-common.c

In the next commit, we will want the usb-common module to be composed of
two object files. Since Kbuild cannot "append" another object to an
existing one, we need to rename usb-common.c to something
else (common.c) and create usb-common.o by linking the wanted objects
together. Currently, usb-common.o comprises only common.o.
