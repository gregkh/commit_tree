power: reset: use restart_notifier mechanism for msm-poweroff

This change replaces use of arm_pm_restart with recently introduced
reset mechanism in Linux kernel called restart_notifier.

Choosing priority 128, which is default priority, as according to
documentation, this mechanism is sufficient to restart the entire system.
