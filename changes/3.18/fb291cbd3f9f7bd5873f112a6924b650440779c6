HID: sony: Corrections for the DualShock 4 HID descriptor

Fix a few minor issues in the HID descriptor:
 - A 6 bit entry had a logical maximum of 255 when the largest it can be is 63.
 - A logical max value was incorrectly being set to -1 instead of 255.
 - Set the min/max of the gyroscopes to -8192/8191 as that is the range of
   values which represent the true controller orientation.  Any values beyond
   those extents are just noise.
