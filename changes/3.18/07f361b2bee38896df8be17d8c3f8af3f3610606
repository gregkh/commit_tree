mm/slab_common: move kmem_cache definition to internal header

We don't need to keep kmem_cache definition in include/linux/slab.h if we
don't need to inline kmem_cache_size().  According to my code inspection,
this function is only called at lc_create() in lib/lru_cache.c which may
be called at initialization phase of something, so we don't need to inline
it.  Therfore, move it to slab_common.c and move kmem_cache definition to
internal header.

After this change, we can change kmem_cache definition easily without full
kernel build.  For instance, we can turn on/off CONFIG_SLUB_STATS without
full kernel build.
