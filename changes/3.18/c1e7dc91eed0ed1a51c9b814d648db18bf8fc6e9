netfilter: nfnetlink_log: fix maximum packet length logged to userspace

don't try to queue payloads > 0xffff - NLA_HDRLEN, it does not work.
The nla length includes the size of the nla struct, so anything larger
results in u16 integer overflow.

This patch is similar to
9cefbbc9c8f9abe (netfilter: nfnetlink_queue: cleanup copy_range usage).
