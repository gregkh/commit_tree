staging: comedi: cb_pcimdda: use comedi_subdevice 'readback'

Use the new comedi_subdevice 'readback' member and the core provided
(*insn_read) for the readback of the analog output subdevice channels.

Remove the unused private data and its allocation.

For aesthetics, rename the (*insn_write) and (*insn_read) functions.
