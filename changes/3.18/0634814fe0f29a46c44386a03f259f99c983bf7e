ASoC: Remove table based DAPM/control setup support from snd_soc_platform_driver

There are no users left and new users should rather use the component_driver
struct embedded in the snd_soc_platform_driver struct to do this. E.g.:

static const struct snd_soc_platform_driver foobar_driver = {
	.component_driver = {
		.dapm_widgets = ...,
		.num_dapm_widgets = ...,
		...,
	},
	...
};

instead of

static const struct snd_soc_platform_driver foobar_driver = {
	.dapm_widgets = ...,
	.num_dapm_widgets = ...,
	...
};

This also allows us to remove the steal_sibling_dai_widgets hack.
