MIPS: Octeon: Make Octeon GPIO IRQ chip CPU hotplug-aware

Make Octeon GPIO IRQ chip CPU hotplug-aware

Seems that irq_cpu_offline callbacks were forgotten in v1 and v2 CIU
GPIO chips. There is such a callback for octeon_irq_chip_ciu2_gpio,
covering CIU2 chips. Without this callback GPIO IRQs are not being migrated
during core offlining. Patch is tested on Octeon II.
