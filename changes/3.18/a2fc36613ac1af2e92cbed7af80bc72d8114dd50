ARM: OMAP3: Use manual idle for UARTs because of DMA errata

In sprz318f.pdf "Usage Note 2.7" says that UARTs cannot acknowledge
idle requests in smartidle mode when configured for DMA operations.
This prevents L4 from going idle. So let's use manual idle mode
instead.

Otherwise systems using Sebastian's 8250 patches with DMA will
never enter deeper idle states because of the errata above.
