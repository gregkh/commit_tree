staging: comedi: adl_pci9118: don't overallocate DMA buffer

The last parameter of `__get_free_pages()` is log2 (the 'order') of the
number of pages to be allocated.  This driver seems to think it is the
linear number of pages, so `pci9118_alloc_dma()` first tries to allocate
16 pages, but only uses 4 of them, setting the buffer size to PAGE_SIZE
multiplied by the 'order'.  If the allocation fails, it tries
progressively smaller orders, down to 0.  If the allocation at order 0
succeeds, the buffer size is set to 0, which is likely to cause
problems.

Set the buffer size to `PAGE_SIZE` shifted left by the allocation order.
Since the maximum buffer size previously used was 4, start with an
allocation order of 2 instead of 4.  Rename the `pages` member of
`struct pci9118_dmabuf` (and the local variable in
`pci9118_alloc_dma()`) to `order` to make it clearer what it is.
