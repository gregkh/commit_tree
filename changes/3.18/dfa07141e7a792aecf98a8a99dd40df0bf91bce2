watchdog: dw_wdt: initialise TOP_INIT in dw_wdt_set_top()

The TOP_INIT, ie bit 4-7 of the WDOG_TIMEOUT_RANGE_REG_OFFSET register
may be zero, so the timeout period may be very short after initialization
is done, thus the system may be reset soon after enabling. We fix this
problem by also initialising the TOP_INIT when setting TOP in function
dw_wdt_set_top().
