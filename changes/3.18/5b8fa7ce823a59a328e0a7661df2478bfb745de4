tipc: eliminate functions tipc_port_init and tipc_port_destroy

After the latest changes to the socket/port layer the existence of
the functions tipc_port_init() and tipc_port_destroy() cannot be
justified. They are both called only once, from tipc_sk_create() and
tipc_sk_delete() respectively, and their functionality can better be
merged into the latter two functions.

This also entails that all remaining references to port_lock now are
made from inside socket.c, something that will make it easier to remove
this lock.
