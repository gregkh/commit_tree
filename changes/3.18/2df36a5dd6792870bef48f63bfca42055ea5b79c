arm/arm64: KVM: Fix BE accesses to GICv2 EISR and ELRSR regs

The EIRSR and ELRSR registers are 32-bit registers on GICv2, and we
store these as an array of two such registers on the vgic vcpu struct.
However, we access them as a single 64-bit value or as a bitmap pointer
in the generic vgic code, which breaks BE support.

Instead, store them as u64 values on the vgic structure and do the
word-swapping in the assembly code, which already handles the byte order
for BE systems.
