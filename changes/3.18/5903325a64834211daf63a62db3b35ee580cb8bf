net/mlx5_core: Identify resources by their type

This patch puts a common part as the first field of mlx5_core_qp. This field is
used to identify which resource generated an event. This is required since upcoming
new resource types such as DC targets are allocated for the same numerical space
as regular QPs and may generate the same events. By searching the resource in the
same table we can then look at the common field to identify the resource.
