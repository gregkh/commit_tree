powerpc: Only set numa node information for present cpus at boottime

As Nish suggested, it makes more sense to init the numa node informatiion
for present cpus at boottime, which could also avoid WARN_ON(1) in
numa_setup_cpu().

With this change, we also need to change the smp_prepare_cpus() to set up
numa information only on present cpus.

For those possible, but not present cpus, their numa information
will be set up after they are started, as the original code did before commit
2fabf084b6ad.
