ACPI / Fan: add ACPI 4.0 style fan support

This patch adds support for ACPI 4.0 style fan, lacking part is: no
support for 'Low Speed Notification Support', 'Fine Grain Control' is
not used yet.

It's not clear what to do on suspend/resume callback for 4.0 style ACPI
fan, so it does nothing for now.
