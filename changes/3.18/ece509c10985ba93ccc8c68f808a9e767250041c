ASoC: max98090: Correct pclk divisor settings

The Baytrail-based chromebooks have a 20MHz mclk, the code was setting
the divisor incorrectly in this case.  According to the 98090
datasheet, the divisor should be set to DIV1 for 10 <= mclk <= 20.
Correct this and the surrounding clock ranges as well to match the
datasheet.
