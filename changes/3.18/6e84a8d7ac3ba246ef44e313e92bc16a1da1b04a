ALSA: usb-audio: Add ctrl message delay quirk for Marantz/Denon devices

This patch adds a USB control message delay quirk for a few specific Marantz/Denon
devices. Without the delay the DACs will not work properly and produces the
following type of messages:

Nov 15 10:09:21 orwell kernel: [   91.342880] usb 3-13: clock source 41 is not valid, cannot use
Nov 15 10:09:21 orwell kernel: [   91.343775] usb 3-13: clock source 41 is not valid, cannot use

There are likely other Marantz/Denon devices using the same USB module which exhibit the
same problems. But as this cannot be verified I limited the patch to the devices
I could test.

The following two devices are covered by this path:
- Marantz SA-14S1
- Marantz HD-DAC1
