net: systemport: enable RX interrupts after NAPI

There is currently a small window during which the SYSTEMPORT adapter
enables its RX interrupts without having enabled its NAPI handler, which
can result in packets to be discarded during interface bringup.

A similar but more serious window exists in bcm_sysport_resume() during
which we can have the RDMA engine not fully prepared to receive packets
and yet having RX interrupts enabled.

Fix this my moving the RX interrupt enable down to
bcm_sysport_netif_start() after napi_enable() for the RX path is called,
which fixes both call sites: bcm_sysport_open() and
bcm_sysport_resume().

Fixes: b02e6d9ba7ad ("net: systemport: add bcm_sysport_netif_{enable,stop}")
