CacheFiles: Fix incorrect test for in-memory object collision

When CacheFiles cache objects are in use, they have in-memory representations,
as defined by the cachefiles_object struct.  These are kept in a tree rooted in
the cache and indexed by dentry pointer (since there's a unique mapping between
object index key and dentry).

Collisions can occur between a representation already in the tree and a new
representation being set up because it takes time to dispose of an old
representation - particularly if it must be unlinked or renamed.

When such a collision occurs, cachefiles_mark_object_active() is meant to check
to see if the old, already-present representation is in the process of being
discarded (ie. FSCACHE_OBJECT_IS_LIVE is not set on it) - and, if so, wait for
the representation to be removed (ie. CACHEFILES_OBJECT_ACTIVE is then
cleared).

However, the test for whether the old representation is still live is checking
the new object - which always will be live at this point.  This leads to an
oops looking like:
