serial: kgdb_nmi: No CON_ENABLED by default

At present this console is optionally registered by NULL checking
arch_kgdb_ops.enable_nmi. In practice this requires the architecture
dependant code to implement some kind of control (e.g. module arguments)
to enable/disable this feature.

The kernel already provides us the perfectly adequate console= argument
to enable/disable consoles. Let's use that instead!
