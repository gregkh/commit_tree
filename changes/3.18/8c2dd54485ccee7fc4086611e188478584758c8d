ieee802154: fix error handling in ieee802154fake_probe()

In case of any failure ieee802154fake_probe() just calls unregister_netdev().
But it does not look safe to unregister netdevice before it was registered.

The patch implements straightforward resource deallocation in case of
failure in ieee802154fake_probe().
