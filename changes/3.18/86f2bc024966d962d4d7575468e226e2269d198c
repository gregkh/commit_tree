ima: remove unnecessary appraisal test

ima_get_action() sets the "action" flags based on policy.
Before collecting, measuring, appraising, or auditing the
file, the "action" flag is updated based on the cached
iint->flags.

This patch removes the subsequent unnecessary appraisal
test in ima_appraise_measurement().
