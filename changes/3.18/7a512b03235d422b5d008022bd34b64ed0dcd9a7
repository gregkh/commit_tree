ARM: exynos_defconfig: Enable Maxim 77693 and I2C GPIO drivers

The Exynos System-on-Chips have ~7 distinctive I2C IO ports (exact
number depends on chip). However some integrated circuits on board, also
using I2C protocol for communication, can be connected to the SoC by
other GPIO. Enabling the I2C GPIO driver allows using such additional
integrated circuits.

An example of such chip using I2C and connected over GPIO to SoC is
Maxim 77693 MUIC on Trats2 board. The regulator driver of Maxim
77693 offers charger and safeout LDO (necessary for USB OTG).
