usb: hub: keep hub->dev reference all the time when struct usb_hub lives

This is just a small optimization of the fix from the commit c605f3cdff53a743f6
("usb: hub: take hub->hdev reference when processing from eventlist).

We do not need to take the reference for each event. Instead we could get it
when struct usb_hub is allocated and put it when it is released. By other words,
we could handle it the same way as the reference for hub->intfdev.

The motivation is that it will make the life easier when switching from khubd
kthread to a workqueue.
