pinctrl: clean up after enable refactoring

commit 2243a87d90b42eb38bc281957df3e57c712b5e56
"pinctrl: avoid duplicated calling enable_pinmux_setting for a pin"
removed the .disable callback from the struct pinmux_ops,
making the .enable() callback the only remaining callback.

However .enable() is a bad name as it seems to imply that a
muxing can also be disabled. Rename the callback to .set_mux()
and also take this opportunity to clean out any remaining
mentions of .disable() from the documentation.
