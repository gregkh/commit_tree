blk-mq: call blk_mq_start_request from ->queue_rq

When we call blk_mq_start_request from the core blk-mq code before calling into
->queue_rq there is a racy window where the timeout handler can hit before we've
fully set up the driver specific part of the command.

Move the call to blk_mq_start_request into the driver so the driver can start
the request only once it is fully set up.
