ath9k: Use normal queues for offchannel frames

There is no reason why frames marked with
IEEE80211_TX_CTL_TX_OFFCHAN have to be sent using
the UAPSD queue. Since mac80211 makes sure that
RoC is done before pushing an offchannel frame
to the driver, we can use the normal TX queues
for transmission.
