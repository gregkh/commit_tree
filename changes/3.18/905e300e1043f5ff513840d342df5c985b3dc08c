USB: host: st: fix ehci/ohci driver selection

The newly added sti ehci and ohci drivers come with a single
Kconfig entry that does not depend on either of the base drivers,
which leads to a link error when they are disabled:

drivers/built-in.o: In function `ohci_platform_init':
:(.init.text+0x14788): undefined reference to `ohci_init_driver'

To fix that, this patch introduces two separate Kconfig options
with proper dependencies, which avoids the problem and is also
more consistent with the other glue drivers.
