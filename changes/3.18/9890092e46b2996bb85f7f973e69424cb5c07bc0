net: tcp: more detailed ACK events and events for CE marked packets

DataCenter TCP (DCTCP) determines cwnd growth based on ECN information
and ACK properties, e.g. ACK that updates window is treated differently
than DUPACK.

Also DCTCP needs information whether ACK was delayed ACK. Furthermore,
DCTCP also implements a CE state machine that keeps track of CE markings
of incoming packets.

Therefore, extend the congestion control framework to provide these
event types, so that DCTCP can be properly implemented as a normal
congestion algorithm module outside of the core stack.

Joint work with Daniel Borkmann and Glenn Judd.
