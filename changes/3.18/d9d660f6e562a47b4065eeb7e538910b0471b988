xen-scsiback: Add Xen PV SCSI backend driver

Introduces the Xen pvSCSI backend. With pvSCSI it is possible for a
Xen domU to issue SCSI commands to a SCSI LUN assigned to that
domU. The SCSI commands are passed to the pvSCSI backend in a driver
domain (usually Dom0) which is owner of the physical device. This
allows e.g. to use SCSI tape drives in a Xen domU.

The code is taken from the pvSCSI implementation in Xen done by
Fujitsu based on Linux kernel 2.6.18.

Changes from the original version are:
- port to upstream kernel
- put all code in just one source file
- adapt to Linux style guide
- use target core infrastructure instead doing pure pass-through
- enable module unloading
- support SG-list in grant page(s)
- support task abort
- remove redundant struct backend
- allocate resources dynamically
- correct minor error in scsiback_fast_flush_area
- free allocated resources in case of error during I/O preparation
- remove CDB emulation, now handled by target core infrastructure
