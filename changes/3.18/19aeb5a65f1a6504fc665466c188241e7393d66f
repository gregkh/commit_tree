GFS2: Make rename not save dirent location

This patch fixes a regression in the patch "GFS2: Remember directory
insert point", commit 2b47dad866d04f14c328f888ba5406057b8c7d33.
The problem had to do with the rename function: The function found
space for the new dirent, and remembered that location. But then the
old dirent was removed, which often moved the eligible location for
the renamed dirent. Putting the new dirent at the saved location
caused file system corruption.

This patch adds a new "save_loc" variable to struct gfs2_diradd.
If 1, the dirent location is saved. If 0, the dirent location is not
saved and the buffer_head is released as per previous behavior.
