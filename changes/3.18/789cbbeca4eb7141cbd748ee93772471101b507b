workqueue: Add quiescent state between work items

Similar to the stop_machine deadlock scenario on !PREEMPT kernels
addressed in b22ce2785d97 "workqueue: cond_resched() after processing
each work item", kworker threads requeueing back-to-back with zero jiffy
delay can stall RCU. The cond_resched call introduced in that fix will
yield only iff there are other higher priority tasks to run, so force a
quiescent RCU state between work items.
