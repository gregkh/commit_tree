ARM: tegra: add PCIe-related pins to the Jetson TK1 pinmux tables

This pinmux tables currently omit any configuration for PCIe clk_req,
wake, and rst pins, which in turn causes intermittent failures in
U-Boot's PCIe support. Import an updated version of the pinmux tables
which rectifies this.

(While I'm still hoping to remove the pinmux tables from DTs for
Tegra124+ devices, while they're still here, they may as well be
complete and correct).
