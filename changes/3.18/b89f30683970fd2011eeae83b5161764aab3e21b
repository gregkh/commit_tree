MIPS: Prevent compiler warning from cop2_{save,restore}

The no-op cases of cop2_save & cop2_restore lead to the following
warnings being emitted during build with recent versions of gcc (tested
using gcc 4.8.3 from the Mentor Sourcery CodeBench 2014.05 toolchain):

  In file included from ./arch/mips/include/asm/switch_to.h:18:0,
                   from kernel/sched/core.c:78:
  kernel/sched/core.c: In function 'finish_task_switch':
  include/asm-generic/current.h:6:45: warning: value computed is not used [-Wunused-value]
   #define get_current() (current_thread_info()->task)
                                               ^

     cop2_restore(current);     \

    finish_arch_switch(prev);
    ^

Avoid the warning by "using" the value by casting to void.
