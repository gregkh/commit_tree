x86, entry: Only call user_exit if TIF_NOHZ

The RCU context tracking code requires that arch code call
user_exit() on any entry into kernel code if TIF_NOHZ is set.  This
patch adds a check for TIF_NOHZ and a comment to the syscall entry
tracing code.

The main purpose of this patch is to make the code easier to follow:
one can read the body of user_exit and of every function it calls
without finding any explanation of why it's called for traced
syscalls but not for untraced syscalls.  This makes it clear when
user_exit() is necessary.
