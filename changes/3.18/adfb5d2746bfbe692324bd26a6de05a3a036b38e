KVM: x86: fix check legal type of Variable Range MTRRs

The first entry in each pair(IA32_MTRR_PHYSBASEn) defines the base
address and memory type for the range; the second entry(IA32_MTRR_PHYSMASKn)
contains a mask used to determine the address range. The legal values
for the type field of IA32_MTRR_PHYSBASEn are 0,1,4,5, and 6. However,
IA32_MTRR_PHYSMASKn don't have type field. This patch avoid check if
the type field is legal for IA32_MTRR_PHYSMASKn.
