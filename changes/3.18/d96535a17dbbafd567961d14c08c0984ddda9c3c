net: Infrastructure for checksum unnecessary conversions

For normal path, added skb_checksum_try_convert which is called
to attempt to convert CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY to CHECKSUM_COMPLETE. The
primary condition to allow this is that ip_summed is CHECKSUM_NONE
and csum_valid is true, which will be the state after consuming
a CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY.

For GRO path, added skb_gro_checksum_try_convert which is the GRO
analogue of skb_checksum_try_convert. The primary condition to allow
this is that NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->csum_cnt == 0 and
NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->csum_valid is set. This implies that we have consumed
all available CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY checksums in the GRO path.
