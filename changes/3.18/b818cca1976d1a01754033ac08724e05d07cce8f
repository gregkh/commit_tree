xfs: refactor recovery transaction start handling

Rework the transaction lookup and allocation code in
xlog_recovery_process_ophdr() to fold two related call-once
helper functions into a single helper. Then fold in all the
XLOG_START_TRANS logic to that helper to clean up the remaining
logic in xlog_recovery_process_ophdr().
