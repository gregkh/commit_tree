scsi: only re-lock door after EH on devices that were reset

Setups that use the blk-mq I/O path can lock up if a host with a single
device that has its door locked enters EH.  Make sure to only send the
command to re-lock the door to devices that actually were reset and thus
might have lost their state.  Otherwise the EH code might be get blocked
on blk_get_request as all requests for non-reset devices might be in use.
