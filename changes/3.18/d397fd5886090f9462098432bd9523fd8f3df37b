staging: comedi: adl_pci9118: remove sanity checks in pci9118_calc_divisors()

The 'tim2' parameter to this function is actually the cmd->convert_arg which
was validated in the (*do_cmdtest) as:

	err |= cfc_check_trigger_arg_min(&cmd->convert_arg,
					 devprivriv->ai_ns_min);

The sanity checks in this function are just repeating that validation. The
'min_pacer' sanity check is simply not needed.

Remove these unnecessary checks.
