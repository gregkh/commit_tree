iio: buffer: Coalesce adjacent demux table entries

When copying multiple multiple samples that are adjacent in both the source as
well as the destination buffer, instead of creating a new demux table entry for
each sample just increase the length of the previous entry by the size of the
new sample. This makes the demuxing process slightly more efficient.
