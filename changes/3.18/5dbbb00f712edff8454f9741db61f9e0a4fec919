clk: Add generic driver for Maxim PMIC clocks

Maxim Integrated Power Management ICs are very similar with
regard to their clock outputs. Most of the clock drivers for
these chips are duplicating code and are simpler enough that
can be converted to use a generic driver to consolidate code
and avoid duplication.
