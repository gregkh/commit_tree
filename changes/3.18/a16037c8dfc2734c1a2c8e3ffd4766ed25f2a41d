percpu: make pcpu_alloc_area() capable of allocating only from populated areas

Update pcpu_alloc_area() so that it can skip unpopulated areas if the
new parameter @pop_only is true.  This is implemented by a new
function, pcpu_fit_in_area(), which determines the amount of head
padding considering the alignment and populated state.

@pop_only is currently always false but this will be used to implement
atomic allocation.
