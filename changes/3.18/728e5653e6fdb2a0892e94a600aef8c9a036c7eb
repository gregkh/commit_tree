sched/x86: Fix up typo in topology detection

Commit:

  cebf15eb09a2 ("x86, sched: Add new topology for multi-NUMA-node CPUs")

some code to try to detect the situation where we have a NUMA node
inside of the "DIE" sched domain.

It detected this by looking for cpus which match_die() but do not match
NUMA nodes via topology_same_node().

I wrote it up as:

	if (match_die(c, o) == !topology_same_node(c, o))

which actually seemed to work some of the time, albiet
accidentally.

It should have been doing an &&, not an ==.

This code essentially chopped off the "DIE" domain on one of
Andrew Morton's systems.  He reported that this patch fixed his
issue.
