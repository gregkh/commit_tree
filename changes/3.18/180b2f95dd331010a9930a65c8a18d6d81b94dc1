block: Replace bi_integrity with bi_special

For commands like REQ_COPY we need a way to pass extra information along
with each bio. Like integrity metadata this information must be
available at the bottom of the stack so bi_private does not suffice.

Rename the existing bi_integrity field to bi_special and make it a union
so we can have different bio extensions for each class of command.

We previously used bi_integrity != NULL as a way to identify whether a
bio had integrity metadata or not. Introduce a REQ_INTEGRITY to be the
indicator now that bi_special can contain different things.

In addition, bio_integrity(bio) will now return a pointer to the
integrity payload (when applicable).
