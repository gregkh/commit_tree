sunvnet: make transmit path zero-copy in the kernel

This patch removes pre-allocated transmit buffers and instead directly maps
pending packets on demand. This saves O(n^2) maximum-sized transmit buffers,
for n hosts on a vswitch, as well as a copy to those buffers.

Single-stream TCP throughput linux-solaris dropped ~5% for 1500-byte MTU,
but linux-linux at 1500-bytes increased ~20%.
