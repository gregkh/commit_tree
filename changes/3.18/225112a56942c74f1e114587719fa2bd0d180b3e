Thermal/int3403: Fix thermal hysteresis unit conversion

Thermal hysteresis represents a temperature difference.
But the original code treats it as a temperature value,
Convert it from tenths of degree Kelvin to Milli-Celsius
by deducing 273200. This is not right.

Kelvin and Celsius have same degree size. From temperature
difference view, the conversion between tenths of degree
Kelvin unit and Milli-Celsius unit is just to multiply 100.
