net: Changes to ip_tunnel to support foo-over-udp encapsulation

This patch changes IP tunnel to support (secondary) encapsulation,
Foo-over-UDP. Changes include:

1) Adding tun_hlen as the tunnel header length, encap_hlen as the
   encapsulation header length, and hlen becomes the grand total
   of these.
2) Added common netlink define to support FOU encapsulation.
3) Routines to perform FOU encapsulation.
