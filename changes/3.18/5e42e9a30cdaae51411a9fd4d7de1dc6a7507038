serial: imx: Fix x_char handling and tx flow control

The serial core expects the UART driver to transmit x_char
(START/STOP chars) even if tx is stopped and before data already
in the tx ring buffer if possible. Also, sending x_char must
not cause additional data in the tx ring buffer to transmit
if tx is stopped.

Cause x_char to be transmitted before any other data is sent.
Auto-stop tx if the tx ring buffer is empty or tx should be stopped.
Only perform one write wakeup if tx ring buffer space is below
threshold.

x_char handling in DMA mode is still broken; add FIXME.
