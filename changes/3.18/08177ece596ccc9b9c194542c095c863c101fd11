serial: asc: Adopt readl_/writel_relaxed()

The architectures supported by this driver, arm and sh, have expensive
implementations of writel(), reliant on spin locks and explicit L2 cache
management. These architectures provide a cheaper writel_relaxed() which
is much better suited to peripherals that do not perform DMA. The
situation with readl()/readl_relaxed()is similar although less acute.

This driver does not use DMA and will be more power efficient and more
robust (due to absence of spin locks during console I/O) if it uses the
relaxed variants.

The driver supports COMPILE_TEST and therefore falls back to writel()
when writel_relaxed() does not exist.
