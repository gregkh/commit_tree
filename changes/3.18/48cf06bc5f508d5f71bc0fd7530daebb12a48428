dm raid: add discard support for RAID levels 4, 5 and 6

In case of RAID levels 4, 5 and 6 we have to verify each RAID members'
ability to zero data on discards to avoid stripe data corruption -- if
discard_zeroes_data is not set for each RAID member discard support must
be disabled.  But given the uncertainty of whether or not a RAID member
properly supports zeroing data on discard we require the user to
explicitly allow discard support on RAID levels 4, 5, and 6 by setting
a dm-raid module paramter, e.g.: dm-raid.devices_handle_discard_safely=Y
Otherwise, discards could cause data corruption on RAID4/5/6.
