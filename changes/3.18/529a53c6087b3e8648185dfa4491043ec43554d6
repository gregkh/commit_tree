[media] vb2: fix multiplanar read() with non-zero data_offset

If this is a multiplanar buf_type and the plane we want to read has a
non-zero data_offset, then that data_offset was not taken into account.

Note that read() or write() for formats with more than one plane is currently
not allowed, hence the use of 'planes[0]' since this is only relevant for a
single-plane format.
