slub: disable tracing and failslab for merged slabs

Tracing of mergeable slabs as well as uses of failslab are confusing since
the objects of multiple slab caches will be affected.  Moreover this
creates a situation where a mergeable slab will become unmergeable.

If tracing or failslab testing is desired then it may be best to switch
merging off for starters.
