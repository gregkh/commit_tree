ath10k: re-enable interrupts properly in hw recovery

Recent changes done to start/restart sequences
broke hw recovery in some hw configurations. The
pci transport was stopped twice however due to a
workaround in the pci disabling code the
disable/enable for first msi interrupt was not
balanced. This ended up with irqs not being
properly re-enabled and the following print out
during recovery:

 ath10k: failed to receive control response completion, polling..
 ath10k: Service connect timeout: -110
 ath10k: Could not init core: -110

Legacy interrupt mode was unaffected while msi
ranged mode would be partially crippled (it would
miss fw indication interrupts but otherwise it
worked fine).

This fixes completely broken fw recovery for a
single msi interrupt mode and fixes subsequent fw
crash reports for msi range interrupt mode.
