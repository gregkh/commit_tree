irqchip: gic: Preserve gic V2 bypass bits in cpu ctrl register

This change is made to preserve the GIC v2 bypass bits in the
GIC_CPU_CTRL register (also known as the GICC_CTLR register in spec).
This code will preserve all bits configured by the bootloader regarding
v2 bypass group bits. In the X-Gene platform, the bypass functionality
is not used and bypass bits should not be changed by the kernel gic
code as it could lead to incorrect behavior.
