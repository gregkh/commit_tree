drm/i915: send PCI_D3hot adapter opregion message on BDW RPM suspend

On BDW we're seeing a problem that after we runtime resume, the
outputs connected to DDI C are not detected: they don't appear in the
SDEISR register and GMBUS transactions don't work. They stop working
at the moment we call intel_opregion_notify_adapter() during runtime
suspend, but they don't go back to work when we call the same function
during runtime resume. They only work after we do a modeset and call
intel_opregion_notify_encoder(), but this point is already too late.

While debugging, I tried to pass PCI_D3hot which is the value that
matches the spec, and it seems to have solved the problem. I couldn't
find any explanation of why this solves the problem, but there's also
no documented explanation - besides our code and git log - of why
Haswell should use PCI_D1, so keep this for now in order to keep BDW
runtime PM working.

Also add a comment to point the fact that there's no spec documenting
all the weirdness involved here.
