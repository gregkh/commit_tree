x86/vdso: Fix vdso2c's special_pages[] error checking

Stephen Rothwell's compiler did something amazing: it unrolled a
loop, discovered that one iteration of that loop contained an
always-true test, and emitted a warning that will IMO only serve
to convince people to disable the warning.

That bogus warning caused me to wonder what prompted such an
absurdity from his compiler, and I discovered that the code in
question was, in fact, completely wrong -- I was looking things
up in the wrong array.

This affects 3.16 as well, but the only effect is to screw up
the error checking a bit.  vdso2c's output is unaffected.
