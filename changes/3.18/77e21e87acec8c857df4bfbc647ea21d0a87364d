x86/efi: Adding efi_printks on memory allocationa and pci.reads

All other calls to allocate memory seem to make some noise already, with the
exception of two calls (for gop, uga) in the setup_graphics path.

The purpose is to be noisy on worrysome errors immediately.

commit fb86b2440de0 ("x86/efi: Add better error logging to EFI boot
stub") introduces printing false alarms for lots of hardware. Rather
than playing Whack a Mole with non-fatal exit conditions, try the other
way round.

This is per Matt Fleming's suggestion:

> all error paths need such messages, e.g. the EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER path
> you highlighted above, but it makes sense for memory allocation and PCI
> read failures.
