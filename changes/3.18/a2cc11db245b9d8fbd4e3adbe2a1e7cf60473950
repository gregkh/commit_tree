Btrfs: fix directory recovery from fsync log

When replaying a directory from the fsync log, if a directory entry
exists both in the fs/subvol tree and in the log, the directory's inode
got its i_size updated incorrectly, accounting for the dentry's name
twice.

Reproducer, from a test for xfstests:

    _scratch_mkfs >> $seqres.full 2>&1
    _init_flakey
    _mount_flakey

    touch $SCRATCH_MNT/foo
    sync

    touch $SCRATCH_MNT/bar
    xfs_io -c "fsync" $SCRATCH_MNT
    xfs_io -c "fsync" $SCRATCH_MNT/bar

    _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_DROP_WRITES
    _unmount_flakey

    _load_flakey_table $FLAKEY_ALLOW_WRITES
    _mount_flakey

    [ -f $SCRATCH_MNT/foo ] || echo "file foo is missing"
    [ -f $SCRATCH_MNT/bar ] || echo "file bar is missing"

    _unmount_flakey
    _check_scratch_fs $FLAKEY_DEV

The filesystem check at the end failed with the message:
"root 5 root dir 256 error".

A test case for xfstests follows.
