Btrfs: fix wrong generation check of super block on a seed device

The super block generation of the seed devices is not the same as the
filesystem which sprouted from them because we don't update the super
block on the seed devices when we change that new filesystem. So we
should not use the generation of that new filesystem to check the super
block generation on the seed devices, Fix it.
