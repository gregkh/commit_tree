KEYS: Reinstate EPERM for a key type name beginning with a '.'

Reinstate the generation of EPERM for a key type name beginning with a '.' in
a userspace call.  Types whose name begins with a '.' are internal only.

The test was removed by:

I think we want to keep the restriction on type name so that userspace can't
add keys of a special internal type.

Note that removal of the test causes several of the tests in the keyutils
testsuite to fail.
