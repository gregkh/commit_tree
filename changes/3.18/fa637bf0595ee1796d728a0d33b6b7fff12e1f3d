bus: arm-ccn: Fix spurious warning message

Because CCN's cycle counter always runs, it will generate
an interrupt on overflow even if the relevant perf event
was not requested, causing a spurious warning message.

Fixed now by warning on only normal counter unwanted
overflows. Also cleaning the overflow mask at init now,
not to warn on event previously requested by firmware.
