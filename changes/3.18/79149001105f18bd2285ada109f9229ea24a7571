ACPI / EC: Fix regression due to conflicting firmware behavior between Samsung and Acer.

It is reported that Samsung laptops that need to poll events are broken by
the following commit:
 Commit 3afcf2ece453e1a8c2c6de19cdf06da3772a1b08
 Subject: ACPI / EC: Add support to disallow QR_EC to be issued when SCI_EVT isn't set

The behaviors of the 2 vendor firmwares are conflict:
 1. Acer: OSPM shouldn't issue QR_EC unless SCI_EVT is set, firmware
         automatically sets SCI_EVT as long as there is event queued up.
 2. Samsung: OSPM should issue QR_EC whatever SCI_EVT is set, firmware
            returns 0 when there is no event queued up.

This patch is a quick fix to distinguish the behaviors to make Acer
behavior only effective for Acer EC firmware so that the breakages on
Samsung EC firmware can be avoided.
