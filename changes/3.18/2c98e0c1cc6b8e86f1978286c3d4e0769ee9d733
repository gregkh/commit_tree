regmap: debugfs: fix possbile NULL pointer dereference

If 'map->dev' is NULL and there will lead dev_name() to be NULL pointer
dereference. So before dev_name(), we need to have check of the map->dev
pionter.

We also should make sure that the 'name' pointer shouldn't be NULL for
debugfs_create_dir(). So here using one default "dummy" debugfs name when
the 'name' pointer and 'map->dev' are both NULL.
