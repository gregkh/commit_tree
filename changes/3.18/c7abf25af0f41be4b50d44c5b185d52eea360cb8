mac80211: fix typo in starting baserate for rts_cts_rate_idx

It affects non-(V)HT rates and can lead to selecting an rts_cts rate
that is not a basic rate or way superior to the reference rate (ATM
rates[0] used for the 1st attempt of the protected frame data).

E.g, assuming drivers register growing (bitrate) sorted tables of
ieee80211_rate-s, having :
- rates[0].idx == d'2 and basic_rates == b'10100
will select rts_cts idx b'10011 & ~d'(BIT(2)-1), i.e. 1, likewise
- rates[0].idx == d'2 and basic_rates == b'10001
will select rts_cts idx b'10000
The first is not a basic rate and the second is > rates[0].

Also, wrt severity of the addressed misbehavior, ATM we only have one
rts_cts_rate_idx rather than one per rate table entry, so this idx might
still point to bitrates > rates[1..MAX_RATES].
