powerpc/booke: Restrict SPE exception handlers to e200/e500 cores

SPE exception handlers are now defined for 32-bit e500mc cores even though
SPE unit is not present and CONFIG_SPE is undefined.

Restrict SPE exception handlers to e200/e500 cores adding CONFIG_SPE_POSSIBLE
and consequently guard __stup_ivors and __setup_cpu functions.
