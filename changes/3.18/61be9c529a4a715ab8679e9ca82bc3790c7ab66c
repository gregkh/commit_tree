xfs: rework xfs_buf_bio_endio error handling

Currently the report of a bio error from completion
immediately marks the buffer with an error. The issue is that this
is racy w.r.t. synchronous IO - the submitter can see b_error being
set before the IO is complete, and hence we cannot differentiate
between submission failures and completion failures.

Add an internal b_io_error field protected by the b_lock to catch IO
completion errors, and only propagate that to the buffer during
final IO completion handling. Hence we can tell in xfs_buf_iorequest
if we've had a submission failure bey checking bp->b_error before
dropping our b_io_remaining reference - that reference will prevent
b_io_error values from being propagated to b_error in the event that
completion races with submission.
