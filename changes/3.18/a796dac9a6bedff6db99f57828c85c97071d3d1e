wireless: core: Reorder wiphy_register() notifications relevantly

Currently it can send regulatory domain change notification before any
NEW_WIPHY notification. Moreover, if rfill_register() fails, calling
wiphy_unregister() will send a DEL_WIPHY though no NEW_WIPHY had been
sent previously.

Thus reordering so it properly notifies NEW_WIPHY before any other.
