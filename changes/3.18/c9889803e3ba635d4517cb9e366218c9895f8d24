regulator: max8660: zero-initialize regulator match table array

The struct of_regulator_match rmatch[] is declared as a non-static local
variable so the structure members are not auto-initialized.

Initialize the array at declaration time to avoid the structure members
values to be indeterminate and have sane defaults instead.
