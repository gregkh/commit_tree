drm/exynos: use drm generic mmap interface

This patch removes DRM_EXYNOS_GEM_MMAP ictrl feature specific
to Exynos drm and instead uses drm generic mmap.

We had used the interface specific to Exynos drm to do mmap directly,
not to use demand paging which maps each page with physical memory
at page fault handler. We don't need the specific mmap interface
because the drm generic mmap which uses vm offset manager stuff can
also do mmap directly.

This patch makes a userspace region to be mapped with whole physical
memory region allocated by userspace request when mmap system call is
requested.

Changelog v2:
- do not set VM_IO, VM_DONTEXPEND and VM_DONTDUMP. These flags were already
  set by drm_gem_mmap
- do not include <linux/anon_inodes.h>, which isn't needed anymore.
