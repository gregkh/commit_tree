i2c: cadence: Set the hardware time-out register to maximum value

Cadence I2C controller has bug wherein it generates invalid read transactions
after timeout in master receiver mode. This driver does not use the HW
timeout and this interrupt is disabled but the feature itself cannot be
disabled. Hence, this patch writes the maximum value (0xFF) to this register.
This is one of the workarounds to this bug and it will not avoid the issue
completely but reduces the chances of error.
