locking/mutexes: Document quick lock release when unlocking

When unlocking, we always want to reach the slowpath with the lock's counter
indicating it is unlocked. -- as returned by the asm fastpath call or by
explicitly setting it. While doing so, at least in theory, we can optimize
and allow faster lock stealing.
