perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix IRP uncore register offsets on Haswell EP

The counter register offsets for the IRP box PMU for Haswell-EP
were incorrect. The offsets actually changed over IvyBridge EP.

Fix them to the correct values. For this we need to fork the read
function from the IVB and use an own counter array.
