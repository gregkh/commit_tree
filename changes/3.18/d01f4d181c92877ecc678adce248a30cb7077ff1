serial: core: Privatize tty->hw_stopped

tty->hw_stopped is not used by the tty core and is thread-unsafe;
hw_stopped is a member of a bitfield whose fields are updated
non-atomically and no lock is suitable for serializing updates.

Replace serial core usage of tty->hw_stopped with uport->hw_stopped.
Use int storage which works around Alpha EV4/5 non-atomic byte storage,
since uart_port uses different locks to protect certain fields within the
structure.
