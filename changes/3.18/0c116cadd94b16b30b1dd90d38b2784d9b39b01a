NFSv4.1: nfs41_clear_delegation_stateid shouldn't trust NFS_DELEGATED_STATE

This patch removes the assumption made previously, that we only need to
check the delegation stateid when it matches the stateid on a cached
open.

If we believe that we hold a delegation for this file, then we must assume
that its stateid may have been revoked or expired too. If we don't test it
then our state recovery process may end up caching open/lock state in a
situation where it should not.
We therefore rename the function nfs41_clear_delegation_stateid as
nfs41_check_delegation_stateid, and change it to always run through the
delegation stateid test and recovery process as outlined in RFC5661.
