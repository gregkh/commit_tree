percpu: fix how @gfp is interpreted by the percpu allocator

When @gfp is specified, the percpu allocator is interested in whether
it contains all of GFP_KERNEL or not.  If it does, the normal
allocation path is taken; otherwise, the atomic allocation path.
Unfortunately, pcpu_alloc() was incorrectly testing for whether @gfp
contains any part of GFP_KERNEL.

Fix it by testing "(gfp & GFP_KERNEL) != GFP_KERNEL" instead of
"!(gfp & GFP_KERNEL)" to decide whether the allocation should be
atomic or not.
