fsnotify: don't put user context if it was never assigned

On some failure paths we may attempt to free user context even if it
wasn't assigned yet.  This will cause a NULL ptr deref and a kernel BUG.

The path I was looking at is in inotify_new_group():

        oevent = kmalloc(sizeof(struct inotify_event_info), GFP_KERNEL);
        if (unlikely(!oevent)) {
                fsnotify_destroy_group(group);
                return ERR_PTR(-ENOMEM);
        }

fsnotify_destroy_group() would get called here, but
group->inotify_data.user is only getting assigned later:

	group->inotify_data.user = get_current_user();
