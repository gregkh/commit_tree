perf hists browser: Cleanup callchain print functions

The hist_browser__show_callchain() and friends don't need to be that
complex.  They're splitted in 3 pieces - one for traversing top-level
tree, other one for special casing first chains in the top-level
entries, and last one for recursive traversing inner trees.  It led to
code duplication and unnecessary complexity IMHO.

Simplify the function and consolidate the logic into a single function
- it can recursively call itself.  A little difference in printing
  callchains in top-level tree can be handled with a small change.

It should have no functional change.
