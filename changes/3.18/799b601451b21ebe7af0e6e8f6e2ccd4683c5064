audit: keep inode pinned

Audit rules disappear when an inode they watch is evicted from the cache.
This is likely not what we want.

The guilty commit is "fsnotify: allow marks to not pin inodes in core",
which didn't take into account that audit_tree adds watches with a zero
mask.

Adding any mask should fix this.
