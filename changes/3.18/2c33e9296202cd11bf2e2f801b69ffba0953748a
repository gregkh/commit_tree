power: max17040: Add ID for MAX77836 Fuel Gauge block

MAX77836 has the same Fuel Gauge as MAX17040/17048. The max17040 driver
can be safely re-used. The patch adds MAX77836 device to the array of
i2c_device_id. Additionally it removes the id associated with MAX17040
device as the value is not used.
