ipv6: White-space cleansing : gaps between function and symbol export

This patch makes no changes to the logic of the code but simply addresses
coding style issues as detected by checkpatch.

Both objdump and diff -w show no differences.

This patch removes some blank lines between the end of a function
definition and the EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL macro in order to prevent
checkpatch warning that EXPORT_SYMBOL must immediately follow
a function.
