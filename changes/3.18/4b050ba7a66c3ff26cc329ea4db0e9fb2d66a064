MIPS: pgtable.h: Implement the pgprot_writecombine function for MIPS

Previously, the pgprot_writecombine function was simply defined
as pgprot_uncached in include/asm-generic/pgtable.h. This is not
optimal for cores that can actually do write-combine memory writes
so define this function to take into account the core's cache coherency
attribute to achieve such behavior.
