hpsa: Fallback to MSI rather than to INTx if MSI-X failed

Currently the driver falls back to INTx mode when MSI-X
initialization failed. This is a suboptimal behaviour
for chips that also support MSI. This update changes that
behaviour and falls back to MSI mode in case MSI-X mode
initialization failed.
