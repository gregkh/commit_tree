ipv6: introduce tcp_v6_iif()

Commit 971f10eca186 ("tcp: better TCP_SKB_CB layout to reduce cache line
misses") added a regression for SO_BINDTODEVICE on IPv6.

This is because we still use inet6_iif() which expects that IP6 control
block is still at the beginning of skb->cb[]

This patch adds tcp_v6_iif() helper and uses it where necessary.

Because __inet6_lookup_skb() is used by TCP and DCCP, we add an iif
parameter to it.
