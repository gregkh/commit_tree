ext4: refactor ext4_move_extents code base

ext4_move_extents is too complex for review. It has duplicate almost
each function available in the rest of other codebase. It has useless
artificial restriction orig_offset == donor_offset. But in fact logic
of ext4_move_extents is very simple:

Iterate extents one by one (similar to ext4_fill_fiemap_extents)
   ->Iterate each page covered extent (similar to generic_perform_write)
     ->swap extents for covered by page (can be shared with IOC_MOVE_DATA)
