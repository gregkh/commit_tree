staging: comedi: das08: use comedi_subdevice 'readback'

Use the new comedi_subdevice 'readback' member and the core provided
(*insn_read) for the readback of the analog output subdevice channels.

The das08_ao_initialize() function is only called when the subdevice
is first setup during the attach. It is used to initialize the channels
to a known state. Absorb that function to simplify the code a bit.
