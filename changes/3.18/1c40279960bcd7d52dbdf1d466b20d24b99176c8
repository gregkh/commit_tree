libata: Un-break ATA blacklist

lib/glob.c provides a new glob_match() function, with arguments in
(pattern, string) order.  It replaced a private function with arguments
in (string, pattern) order, but I didn't swap the call site...

The result was the entire ATA blacklist was effectively disabled.

The lesson for today is "I f***ed up *how* badly *how* many months ago?",
er, I mean "Nobody Tests RC Kernels On Legacy Hardware".

This was not a subtle break, but it made it through an entire RC
cycle unreported, presumably because all the people doing testing
have full-featured hardware.

(FWIW, the reason for the argument swap was because fnmatch() does it that
way, and for a while implementing a full fnmatch() was being considered.)
