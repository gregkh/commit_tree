Btrfs: fix unprotected assignment of the target device

We didn't protect the assignment of the target device, it might cause the
problem that the super block update was skipped because we might find wrong
size of the target device during the assignment. Fix it by moving the
assignment sentences into the initialization function of the target device.
And there is another merit that we can check if the target device is suitable
more early.
