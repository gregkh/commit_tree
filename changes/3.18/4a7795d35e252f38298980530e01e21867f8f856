vfs: fix reference leak in d_prune_aliases()

In "d_prune_alias(): just lock the parent and call __dentry_kill()" the old
dget + d_drop + dput has been replaced with lock_parent + __dentry_kill;
unfortunately, dput() does more than just killing dentry - it also drops the
reference to parent.  New variant leaks that reference and needs dput(parent)
after killing the child off.
