libceph: fix a use after free issue in osdmap_set_max_osd

If the state variable is krealloced successfully, map->osd_state will be
freed, once following two reallocation failed, and exit the function
without resetting map->osd_state, map->osd_state become a wild pointer.

fix it by resetting them after krealloc successfully.
