arm64: Fix memblock current_limit with 64K pages and 48-bit VA

With 48-bit VA space, the 64K page configuration uses 3 levels instead
of 2 and PUD_SIZE != PMD_SIZE. Since with 64K pages we only cover
PMD_SIZE with the initial swapper_pg_dir populated in head.S, the
memblock current_limit needs to be set accordingly in map_mem() to avoid
allocating unmapped memory. The memblock current_limit is progressively
increased as more blocks are mapped.
