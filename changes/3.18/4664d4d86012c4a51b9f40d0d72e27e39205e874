ARM: OMAP5 / DRA7: PM / wakeupgen: Enables ES2 PM mode by default

Enables MPUSS ES2 power management mode using ES2_PM_MODE in
AMBA_IF_MODE register.

0x0: OMAP5 ES1 behavior, CPU cores would enter and exit OFF mode together.
     Broken! Fortunately, we do not support this anymore.
0x1: OMAP5 ES2, DRA7 behavior, CPU cores are allowed to enter/exit OFF mode
     independently.

This is one time settings thanks to always ON domain.
