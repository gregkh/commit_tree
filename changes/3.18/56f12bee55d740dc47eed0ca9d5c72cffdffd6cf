powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Simplify catalog_read()

catalog_read() implements the read interface for the sysfs file

	/sys/bus/event_source/devices/hv_24x7/interface/catalog

It essentially takes a buffer, an offset and count as parameters
to the read() call.  It makes a hypervisor call to read a specific
page from the catalog and copy the required bytes into the given
buffer. Each call to catalog_read() returns at most one 4K page.

Given these requirements, we should be able to simplify the
catalog_read().
