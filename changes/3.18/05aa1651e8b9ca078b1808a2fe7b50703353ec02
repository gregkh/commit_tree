sparc64: T5 PMU

The T5 (niagara5) has different PCR related HV fast trap values and a new
HV API Group. This patch utilizes these and shares when possible with niagara4.

We use the same sparc_pmu niagara4_pmu. Should there be new effort to
obtain the MCU perf statistics then this would have to be changed.
