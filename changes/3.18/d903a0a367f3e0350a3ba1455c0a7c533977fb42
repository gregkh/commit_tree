[media] omap3isp: resizer: Remove slow debugging message from interrupt handler

The resizer_set_input_size() function prints a debugging message with
the input width and height values. As the function is called from
interrupt context, printing that message to the serial console could
slow down the interrupt handler and cause it to miss the start of the
next frame, causing image corruption.

Fix this by reorganizing the resizer debug messages. The driver now
prints the input size, the crop rectangle and the output size in the set
selection handler instead of scattering debug messages in various
places.
