PM / Domains: Add generic OF-based PM domain look-up

This patch introduces generic code to perform PM domain look-up using
device tree and automatically bind devices to their PM domains.

Generic device tree bindings are introduced to specify PM domains of
devices in their device tree nodes.

Backwards compatibility with legacy Samsung-specific PM domain bindings
is provided, but for now the new code is not compiled when
CONFIG_ARCH_EXYNOS is selected to avoid collision with legacy code.
This will change as soon as the Exynos PM domain code gets converted to
use the generic framework in further patch.

This patch was originally submitted by Tomasz Figa when he was employed
by Samsung.
