arm64: dmi: Add SMBIOS/DMI support

SMBIOS is important for server hardware vendors. It implements a spec for
providing descriptive information about the platform. Things like serial
numbers, physical layout of the ports, build configuration data, and the like.

This has been tested by dmidecode and lshw tools.

This patch adds the call to dmi_scan_machine() to arm64_enter_virtual_mode(),
as that is the point where the EFI Configuration Tables are registered as
being available. It needs to be in an early_initcall anyway as dmi_id_init(),
which is an arch_initcall itself, depends on dmi_scan_machine() having been
called already.
