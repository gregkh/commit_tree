bdi: reimplement bdev_inode_switch_bdi()

A block_device may be attached to different gendisks and thus
different bdis over time.  bdev_inode_switch_bdi() is used to switch
the associated bdi.  The function assumes that the inode could be
dirty and transfers it between bdis if so.  This is a bit nasty in
that it reaches into bdi internals.

This patch reimplements the function so that it writes out the inode
if dirty.  This is a lot simpler and can be implemented without
exposing bdi internals.
