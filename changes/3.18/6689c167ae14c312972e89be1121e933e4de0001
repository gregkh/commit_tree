drm/i915: Rework GPU reset sequence to match driver load & thaw

This patch is to address Daniels concerns over different code during reset:

http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/intel-gfx/2014-June/047758.html

"The reason for aiming as hard as possible to use the exact same code for
driver load, gpu reset and runtime pm/system resume is that we've simply
seen too many bugs due to slight variations and unintended omissions."

Tested using igt drv_hangman.

V2: Cleaner way of preventing check_wedge returning -EAGAIN
V3: Clean the last_context during reset, to ensure do_switch() does the MI_SET_CONTEXT. As per review.
