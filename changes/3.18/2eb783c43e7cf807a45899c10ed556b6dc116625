tun: Fix TUN_PKT_STRIP setting

We set the flag TUN_PKT_STRIP if the user buffer provided is too
small to contain the entire packet plus meta-data.  However, this
has been broken ever since we added GSO meta-data.  VLAN acceleration
also has the same problem.

This patch fixes this by taking both into account when setting the
TUN_PKT_STRIP flag.

The fact that this has been broken for six years without anyone
realising means that nobody actually uses this flag.
