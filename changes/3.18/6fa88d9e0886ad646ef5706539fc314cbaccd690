MIPS: MSP71xx: Fix build error

When CONFIG_MIPS_MT_SMP is enabled, the following compilation error
occurs:

arch/mips/pmcs-msp71xx/msp_irq_cic.c:134: error: ‘irq’ undeclared

This code clearly never saw a compiler.
The surrounding code suggests, that 'd->irq' was intended, not
'irq'.

This error was found with vampyr.
