KVM: ARM: vgic: plug irq injection race

As it stands, nothing prevents userspace from injecting an interrupt
before the guest's GIC is actually initialized.

This goes unnoticed so far (as everything is pretty much statically
allocated), but ends up exploding in a spectacular way once we switch
to a more dynamic allocation (the GIC data structure isn't there yet).

The fix is to test for the "ready" flag in the VGIC distributor before
trying to inject the interrupt. Note that in order to avoid breaking
userspace, we have to ignore what is essentially an error.
