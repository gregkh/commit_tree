regulator: as3711: Remove unused fields from as3711_regulator_info and as3711_regulator

The max_uV is not used, so remove it from struct as3711_regulator_info.
Current code is using devm_regulator_register(), so we don't need to store *rdev
in struct as3711_regulator for clean up.

Also clean up AS3711_REG macro to remove _vshift, _min_uV and _max_uV arguments.
_vshift is always 0, so remove it.
_min_uV and _max_uV are not required, all required settings are set in
REGULATOR_LINEAR_RANGE macro.
