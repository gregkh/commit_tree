ftrace: Set callback to ftrace_stub when no ops are registered

The clean up that adds the helper function ftrace_ops_get_func()
caused the default function to not change when DYNAMIC_FTRACE was not
set and no ftrace_ops were registered. Although static tracing is
not very useful (not having DYNAMIC_FTRACE set), it is still supported
and we don't want to break it.

Clean up the if statement even more to specifically have the default
function call ftrace_stub when no ftrace_ops are registered. This
fixes the small bug for static tracing as well as makes the code a
bit more understandable.
