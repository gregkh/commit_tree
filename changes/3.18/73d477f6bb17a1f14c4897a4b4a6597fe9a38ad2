drm/i915/bdw: Interrupts with logical rings

We need to attend context switch interrupts from all rings. Also, fixed writing
IMR/IER and added HWSTAM at ring init time.

Notice that, if added to irq_enable_mask, the context switch interrupts would
be incorrectly masked out when the user interrupts are due to no users waiting
on a sequence number. Therefore, this commit adds a bitmask of interrupts to
be kept unmasked at all times.

v2: Disable HWSTAM, as suggested by Damien (nobody listens to these interrupts,
anyway).

v3: Add new get/put_irq functions.
