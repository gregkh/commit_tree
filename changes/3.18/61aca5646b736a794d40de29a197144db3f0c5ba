ASoC: Add component level probe/remove support

Now that we have a unified probe and remove path make sure to call them for all
components. soc_{probe,remove}_component are responsible for setting up the DAPM
context for the component, initialize the component prefix, manage the debugfs
entries as well as do the registration of table based controls and DAPM
elements. They also call the component drivers probe and remove callbacks. This
patch makes these things available for generic snd_soc_component drivers rather
than only having them for snd_soc_codec and snd_soc_platform drivers.
