rtc: Disable EFI rtc for x86

commit da167ad7638759 ("rtc: ia64: allow other architectures to use EFI
RTC") inadvertently introduced a regression for x86 because we've been
careful not to enable the EFI rtc driver due to the generally buggy
implementations of the time-related EFI runtime services.

In fact, since the above commit was merged we've seen reports of crashes
on 32-bit tablets,

Disable it explicitly for x86 so that we don't give users false hope
that this driver will work - it won't, and your machine is likely to
crash.
