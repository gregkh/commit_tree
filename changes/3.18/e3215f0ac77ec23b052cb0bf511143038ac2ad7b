ixgbe: fix race when setting advertised speed

Following commands:

modprobe ixgbe
ifconfig ethX up
ethtool -s ethX advertise 0x020

can lead to "setup link failed with code -14" error due to the setup_link
call racing with the SFP detection routine in the watchdog.

This patch resolves this issue by protecting the setup_link call with check
for __IXGBE_IN_SFP_INIT.
