[media] cx231xx: Add support for Hauppauge WinTV-HVR-900H (111xxx)

Add support for:
	[2040:b138] Hauppauge WinTV HVR-900H (111xxx)

The hardware is similar to [2040:b130] Hauppauge WinTV 930C-HD (model 1113xx)
The only difference is the demod Si2161 instead of Si2165 (but both are
supported by the si2165 driver).
