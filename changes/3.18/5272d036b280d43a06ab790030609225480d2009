ntfs: use find_get_page_flags() to mark page accessed as it is no longer marked later on

Mel Gorman's commit 2457aec63745 ("mm: non-atomically mark page accessed
during page cache allocation where possible") removed mark_page_accessed()
calls from NTFS without updating the matching find_lock_page() to
find_get_page_flags(GFP_LOCK | FGP_ACCESSED) thus causing the page to
never be marked accessed.

This patch fixes that.
