spi: Only call transfer_one() if we have buffers to transfer

Client drivers such as the ChomeOS EC driver sometimes use transfers with
no buffers and only a delay specified in order to allow a delay after the
assertion of /CS. Rather than require controller drivers handle this noop
case gracefully put checks in the core to ensure that we don't call into
the controller for such transfers.
