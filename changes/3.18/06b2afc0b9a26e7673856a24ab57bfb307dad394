perf machine: Fallback to MAP__FUNCTION if daddr maps are NULL

As we run "perf c2c" on more applications, we noticed we're missing
significant samples from a common customer's application.  Looking at
the /proc/<pid>/maps file for the app, we see "rwxs" and "rwxp"
permissions on many of the shared memory & heap regions, and on all the
thread stacks.

Because those regions have the "x" bit set, perf marks them with a
MAP_FUNCTION type.  Hence ip_resolve_data() never finds load or store
events coming from them.

We fixed this by re-calling thread__find_addr_location with
MAP__FUNCTION in the case where map is NULL as a last ditch effort to
map the sample before giving up and dropping it.
