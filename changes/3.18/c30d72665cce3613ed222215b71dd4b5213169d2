be2net: fix RX fragment posting for jumbo frames

In the RX path, the driver currently consumes upto 64 (budget) packets in
one NAPI sweep. When the size of the packet received is larger than a
fragment size (2K), more than one fragment is consumed for each packet.
As the driver currently posts a max of 64 fragments, all the consumed
fragments may not be replenished. This can cause avoidable drops in RX path.
This patch fixes this by posting a max(consumed_frags, 64) frags. This is
done only when there are atleast 64 free slots in the RXQ.
