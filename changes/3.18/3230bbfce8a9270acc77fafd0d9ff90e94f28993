ACPI: introduce ACPI int340x thermal scan handler

Newer laptops and tablets that use ACPI may have thermal sensors and
other devices with thermal control capabilities outside the core CPU/SOC,
for thermal safety reasons.
They are exposed for the OS to use via
1) INT3400 ACPI device object as the master.
2) INT3401 ~ INT340B ACPI device objects as the slaves.

This patch introduces a scan handler to enumerate the INT3400
ACPI device object to platform bus, and prevent its slaves
from being enumerated before the controller driver being probed.
