net: sched: remove tcf_proto from ematch calls

This removes the tcf_proto argument from the ematch code paths that
only need it to reference the net namespace. This allows simplifying
qdisc code paths especially when we need to tear down the ematch
from an RCU callback. In this case we can not guarentee that the
tcf_proto structure is still valid.
