sd: Honor block layer integrity handling flags

A set of flags introduced in the block layer enable better control over
how protection information is handled. These flags are useful for both
error injection and data recovery purposes. Checking can be enabled and
disabled for controller and disk, and the guard tag format is now a
per-I/O property.

Update sd_protect_op to communicate the relevant information to the
low-level device driver via a set of flags in scsi_cmnd.
