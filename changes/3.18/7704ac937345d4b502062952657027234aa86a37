HID: wacom: implement generic HID handling for pen generic devices

ISDv4 and v5 are plain HID devices. We can directly implement a generic
HID parsing/handling and remove the need to manually add those PID in
the list of supported devices.

This patch implements the pen support only. The finger part will come in
a later patch.

To be properly notified of an .event() and a .report(), we need to force
hid-core to go through the HID parsing. By default, wacom.ko binds only
hidraw, so the hid parsing is not done by hid-core. When a true HID device
is there, we add the flag HID_CLAIMED_DRIVER to hid->claimed which will
force hid-core to parse the incoming reports.
(Note that this can be easily backported by directly setting the .claimed
flag to HID_CLAIMED_DRIVER even if hid-core does not support
HID_CONNECT_DRIVER)
