Btrfs: load checksum data once when submitting a direct read io

The current code would load checksum data for several times when we split
a whole direct read io because of the limit of the raid stripe, it would
make us search the csum tree for several times. In fact, it just wasted time,
and made the contention of the csum tree root be more serious. This patch
improves this problem by loading the data at once.
