ipv6: White-space cleansing : Line Layouts

This patch makes no changes to the logic of the code but simply addresses
coding style issues as detected by checkpatch.

Both objdump and diff -w show no differences.

A number of items are addressed in this patch:
* Multiple spaces converted to tabs
* Spaces before tabs removed.
* Spaces in pointer typing cleansed (char *)foo etc.
* Remove space after sizeof
* Ensure spacing around comparators such as if statements.
