kvm: fix kvm_is_mmio_pfn() and rename to kvm_is_reserved_pfn()

This reverts commit 85c8555ff0 ("KVM: check for !is_zero_pfn() in
kvm_is_mmio_pfn()") and renames the function to kvm_is_reserved_pfn.

The problem being addressed by the patch above was that some ARM code
based the memory mapping attributes of a pfn on the return value of
kvm_is_mmio_pfn(), whose name indeed suggests that such pfns should
be mapped as device memory.

However, kvm_is_mmio_pfn() doesn't do quite what it says on the tin,
and the existing non-ARM users were already using it in a way which
suggests that its name should probably have been 'kvm_is_reserved_pfn'
from the beginning, e.g., whether or not to call get_page/put_page on
it etc. This means that returning false for the zero page is a mistake
and the patch above should be reverted.
