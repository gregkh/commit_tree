[media] ngene: properly handle __user ptr

Sparse is complaining about ngene's bad usage of a __user ptr:

>> drivers/media/pci/ngene/ngene-dvb.c:62:48: sparse: incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces)
   drivers/media/pci/ngene/ngene-dvb.c:62:48:    expected unsigned char const [usertype] *buf
   drivers/media/pci/ngene/ngene-dvb.c:62:48:    got char const [noderef] <asn:1>*buf

As this is intercepting a .write() file ops, we can't just memcpy. We need to use
copy_from_user.
