powerpc/booke: Revert SPE/AltiVec common defines for interrupt numbers

Book3E specification defines shared interrupt numbers for SPE and AltiVec
units. Still SPE is present in e200/e500v2 cores while AltiVec is present in
e6500 core. So we can currently decide at compile-time which unit to support
exclusively. As Alexander Graf suggested, this will improve code readability
especially in KVM.

Use distinct defines to identify SPE/AltiVec interrupt numbers, reverting
c58ce397 and 6b310fc5 patches that added common defines.
