fs: namespace: suppress 'may be used uninitialized' warnings

The gcc version 4.9.1 compiler complains Even though it isn't possible for
these variables to not get initialized before they are used.

fs/namespace.c: In function ‘SyS_mount’:
fs/namespace.c:2720:8: warning: ‘kernel_dev’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  ret = do_mount(kernel_dev, kernel_dir->name, kernel_type, flags,
        ^
fs/namespace.c:2699:8: note: ‘kernel_dev’ was declared here
  char *kernel_dev;
        ^
fs/namespace.c:2720:8: warning: ‘kernel_type’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  ret = do_mount(kernel_dev, kernel_dir->name, kernel_type, flags,
        ^
fs/namespace.c:2697:8: note: ‘kernel_type’ was declared here
  char *kernel_type;
        ^

Fix the warnings by simplifying copy_mount_string() as suggested by Al Viro.
