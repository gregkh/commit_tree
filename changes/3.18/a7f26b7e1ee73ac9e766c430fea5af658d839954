inet: remove dead inetpeer sequence code

inetpeer sequence numbers are no longer incremented, so no need to
check and flush the tree. The function that increments the sequence
number was already dead code and removed in in "ipv4: remove unused
function" (068a6e18). Remove the code that checks for a change, too.

Verifying that v4_seq and v6_seq are never incremented and thus that
flush_check compares bp->flush_seq to 0 is trivial.

The second part of the change removes flush_check completely even
though bp->flush_seq is exactly !0 once, at initialization. This
change is correct because the time this branch is true is when
bp->root == peer_avl_empty_rcu, in which the branch and
inetpeer_invalidate_tree are a NOOP.
