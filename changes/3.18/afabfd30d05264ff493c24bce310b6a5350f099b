xfs: combine xfs_rtmodify_summary and xfs_rtget_summary

xfs_rtmodify_summary and xfs_rtget_summary are almost identical;
fold them into xfs_rtmodify_summary_int(), with wrappers for each of
the original calls.

The _int function modifies if a delta is passed, and returns a
summary pointer if *sum is passed.
