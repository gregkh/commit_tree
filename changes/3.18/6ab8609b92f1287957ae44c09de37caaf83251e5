Staging: rtl8192e: rtl8192e: Remove assigned unused variable

This patch removes an initialized variable which has never been used.
The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used to make this transformation:

@e@
identifier i;
position p;
type T;
@@

extern T i@p;

@@
type T;
identifier i;
constant C;
position p != e.p;
@@

- T i@p;
  <+... when != i
- i = C;
  ...+>

The braces around if and else which become unnecessary after the transformation
were also removed.
