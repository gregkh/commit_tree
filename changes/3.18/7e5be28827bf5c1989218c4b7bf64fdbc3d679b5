svcrdma: advertise the correct max payload

Svcrdma currently advertises 1MB, which is too large.  The correct value
is the minimum of RPCSVC_MAXPAYLOAD and the max scatter-gather allowed
in an NFSRDMA IO chunk * the host page size. This bug is usually benign
because the Linux X64 NFSRDMA client correctly limits the payload size to
the correct value (64*4096 = 256KB).  But if the Linux client is PPC64
with a 64KB page size, then the client will indeed use a payload size
that will overflow the server.
