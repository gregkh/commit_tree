mm, compaction: reduce zone checking frequency in the migration scanner

The unification of the migrate and free scanner families of function has
highlighted a difference in how the scanners ensure they only isolate
pages of the intended zone.  This is important for taking zone lock or lru
lock of the correct zone.  Due to nodes overlapping, it is however
possible to encounter a different zone within the range of the zone being
compacted.

The free scanner, since its inception by commit 748446bb6b5a ("mm:
compaction: memory compaction core"), has been checking the zone of the
first valid page in a pageblock, and skipping the whole pageblock if the
zone does not match.

This checking was completely missing from the migration scanner at first,
and later added by commit dc9086004b3d ("mm: compaction: check for
overlapping nodes during isolation for migration") in a reaction to a bug
report.  But the zone comparison in migration scanner is done once per a
single scanned page, which is more defensive and thus more costly than a
check per pageblock.

This patch unifies the checking done in both scanners to once per
pageblock, through a new pageblock_pfn_to_page() function, which also
includes pfn_valid() checks.  It is more defensive than the current free
scanner checks, as it checks both the first and last page of the
pageblock, but less defensive by the migration scanner per-page checks.
It assumes that node overlapping may result (on some architecture) in a
boundary between two nodes falling into the middle of a pageblock, but
that there cannot be a node0 node1 node0 interleaving within a single
pageblock.

The result is more code being shared and a bit less per-page CPU cost in
the migration scanner.
