irqchip: renesas-intc-irqpin: Add suspend-to-RAM wake up support

Set the ->irq_enable() and ->irq_disable() methods to NULL to enable
lazy disable of interrupts, and set IRQCHIP_MASK_ON_SUSPEND to tell the
core that only IRQs marked as wake-ups need to stay enabled during
suspend-to-RAM.

This makes wake-up by gpio-keys from suspend-to-RAM work on
r8a7740/Armadillo.
