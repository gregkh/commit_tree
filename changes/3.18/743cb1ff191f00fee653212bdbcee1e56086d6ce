sched/fair: Make calculate_imbalance() independent

Rik noticed that calculate_imbalance() relies on
update_sd_pick_busiest() to guarantee that busiest->sum_nr_running >
busiest->group_capacity_factor.

Break this implicit assumption (with the intent of not providing it
anymore) by having calculat_imbalance() verify it and not rely on
others.
