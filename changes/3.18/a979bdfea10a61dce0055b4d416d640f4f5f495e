xfs: refactor single extent shift into xfs_bmse_shift_one() helper

xfs_bmap_shift_extents() has a variety of conditions and error checks
that make the logic difficult to follow and indent heavy. Refactor the
loop body of this function into a new xfs_bmse_shift_one() helper. This
simplifies the error checks, eliminates index decrement on merge hack by
pushing the index increment down into the helper, and makes the code
more readable by reducing multiple levels of indentation.

This is a code refactor only. The behavior of extent shift and collapse
range is not modified.
