net: introduce netdevice gso_min_segs attribute

Some TSO engines might have a too heavy setup cost, that impacts
performance on hosts sending small bursts (2 MSS per packet).

This patch adds a device gso_min_segs, allowing drivers to set
a minimum segment size for TSO packets, according to the NIC
performance.

Tested on a mlx4 NIC, this allows to get a ~110% increase of
throughput when sending 2 MSS per packet.
