rcu: Don't track sysidle state if no nohz_full= CPUs

If there are no nohz_full= CPUs, then there is currently no reason to
track sysidle state.  This commit therefore short-circuits this state
tracking if !tick_nohz_full_enabled().

Note that these checks will need to be revisited if nohz_full= state
can ever be changed at runtime.
