drm/i915: Set M2_N2 registers during mode set

For Gen < 8, set M2_N2 registers on every mode set. This is required to make
sure M2_N2 registers are set during boot, resume from sleep for cross-
checking the state. The register is set only if DRRS is supported.

v2: Patch rebased

v3: Daniel's review comments
	- Removed HAS_DRRS(dev) and added bool has_drrs to pipe_config to
	track drrs support

v4: Jesse's review comments
	- Made changes to set m2_n2 in intel_dp_set_m_n()
