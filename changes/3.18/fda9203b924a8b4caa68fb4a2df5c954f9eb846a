Documentation: bcm7120-l2: Add Broadcom BCM7120-style L2 binding

This patch adds the Device Tree binding document for the Broadcom
BCM7120-style Set-top-box Level 2 interrupt controller hardware.

We provide some ascii art explaining the different roles and reasons why
some properties are introduced to represent that interrupt controller.
