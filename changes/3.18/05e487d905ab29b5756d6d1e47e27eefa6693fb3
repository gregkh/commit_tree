watchdog: qcom: register a restart notifier

The WDT's BITE_TIME warm-reset behavior can be leveraged as a last
resort mechanism for triggering chip reset.  Usually, other restart
methods (such as PS_HOLD) are preferrable for issuing a more complete
reset of the chip.  As such, keep the priority of the watchdog notifier
low.
