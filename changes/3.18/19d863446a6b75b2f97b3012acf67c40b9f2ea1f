ARM: imx: add an exclusive gate clock type

There are a couple of gate clocks are mutually exclusive on i.MX6, i.e.
LVDSCLK1_IBEN and LVDSCLK1_OBEN.  They cannot be enabled simultaneously.
This patches adds an exclusive gate clock type specifically for such
case.  The clock driver will need to call imx_clk_gate_exclusive() to
register a gate clock with parameter exclusive_mask indicating the mask
of gate bits which are mutually exclusive to this gate clock.

Right now, it only handles the exclusive gate clocks which are defined
in a single hardware register, which is the case we're running into
today.  But it can be extended to handle exclusive gate clocks defined
in different registers later if needed.
