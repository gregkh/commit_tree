tty: serial: 8250_core: allow to set ->throttle / ->unthrottle callbacks

The OMAP UART provides support for HW assisted flow control. What is
missing is the support to throttle / unthrottle callbacks which are used
by the omap-serial driver at the moment.
This patch adds the callbacks. It should be safe to add them since they
are only invoked from the serial_core (uart_throttle()) if the feature
flags are set.
