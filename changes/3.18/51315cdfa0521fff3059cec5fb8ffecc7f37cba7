cpufreq: allow driver-specific data

This commit extends the cpufreq_driver structure with an additional
'void *driver_data' field that can be filled by the ->probe() function
of a cpufreq driver to pass additional custom information to the
driver itself.

A new function called cpufreq_get_driver_data() is added to allow a
cpufreq driver to retrieve those driver data, since they are typically
needed from a cpufreq_policy->init() callback, which does not have
access to the cpufreq_driver structure. This function call is similar
to the existing cpufreq_get_current_driver() function call.
