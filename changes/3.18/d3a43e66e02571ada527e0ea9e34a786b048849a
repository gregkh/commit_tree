xhci: Fold queue_set_tr_deq into xhci_queue_new_dequeue_state

xhci_queue_new_dequeue_state is the only caller of queue_set_tr_deq
and queue_set_tr_deq checks for SET_DEQ_PENDING, where as
xhci_queue_new_dequeue_state sets it which is inconsistent.

Simply fold the 2 into one is a nice cleanup and fixes the inconsistency.
