integrity: base integrity subsystem kconfig options on integrity

The integrity subsystem has lots of options and takes more than
half of the security menu.  This patch consolidates the options
under "integrity", which are hidden if not enabled.  This change
does not affect existing configurations.  Re-configuration is not
needed.

Changes v4:
- no need to change "integrity subsystem" to menuconfig as
options are hidden, when not enabled. (Mimi)
- add INTEGRITY Kconfig help description

Changes v3:
- dependency to INTEGRITY removed when behind 'if INTEGRITY'

Changes v2:
- previous patch moved integrity out of the 'security' menu.
  This version keeps integrity as a security option (Mimi).
