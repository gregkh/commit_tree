drm/vmwgfx: Fix drm.h include

The userspace drm.h include doesn't prefix the drm directory.  This can lead
to compile failures as /usr/include/drm/ isn't in the standard gcc include
paths.  Fix it to be <drm/drm.h>, which matches the rest of the driver drm
header files that get installed into /usr/include/drm.
