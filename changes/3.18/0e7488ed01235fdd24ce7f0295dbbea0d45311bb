dma: mv_xor: Remove all interrupt magic numbers

This commit replaces the current magic numbers in the interrupt handling
with proper macros, which makes more readable and self-documenting.

While here replace the BUG() with a noisy WARN_ON(). There's no reason
to tear down the entire system for an DMA IRQ error.
