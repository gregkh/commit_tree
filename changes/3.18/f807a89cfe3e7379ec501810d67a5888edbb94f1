ARM: at91: PIT: Rework probe functions

The PIT timer driver until now had a single probe function, disregarding wether
it was probed through DT or in the old-style way. This code later on was
calling some DT function to retrieve the proper values for its base address,
interrupts and clocks.

While this was working, it was preventing the usage of CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE,
and the two different probe path were not as clearly separated as they could
be.

Rework the probe path to take this into account, and switch to
CLOCKSOURCE_OF_DECLARE.
