rbd: use helpers to handle discard for layered images correctly

Only allocate two osd ops for discard requests, since the
preallocation hint is only added for regular writes.  Use
rbd_img_obj_request_fill() to recreate the original write or discard
osd operations, isolating that logic to one place, and change the
assert in rbd_osd_req_create_copyup() to accept discard requests as
well.
