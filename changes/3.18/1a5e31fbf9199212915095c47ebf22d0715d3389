rcutorture: Use bash shell for all the test scripts

Some of the scripts encode a default /bin/sh shell. On systems which use
dash as default shell, these scripts fail as they are bash scripts. I
encountered this while testing the sprintf() changes on a Debian system
where dash is the default shell.

This commit changes all such uses to use bash explicitly.
