iser-target: Handle DEVICE_REMOVAL event on network portal listener correctly

In this case the cm_id->context is the isert_np, and the cm_id->qp
is NULL, so use that to distinct the cases.

Since we don't expect any other events on this cm_id we can
just return -1 for explicit termination of the cm_id by the
cma layer.
