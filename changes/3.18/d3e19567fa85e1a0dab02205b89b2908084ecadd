thermal: Exynos: Deletion of unnecessary checks before two function calls

The functions cpufreq_cooling_unregister() and thermal_zone_device_unregister()
test whether their argument is NULL and then return immediately.
Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
