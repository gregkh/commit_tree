openvswitch: Don't validate IPv6 label masks.

When userspace doesn't provide a mask, OVS datapath generates a fully
unwildcarded mask for the flow by copying the flow and setting all bits
in all fields. For IPv6 label, this creates a mask that matches on the
upper 12 bits, causing the following error:

openvswitch: netlink: Invalid IPv6 flow label value (value=ffffffff, max=fffff)

This patch ignores the label validation check for masks, avoiding this
error.
