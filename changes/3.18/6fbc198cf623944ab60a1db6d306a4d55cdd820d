virtio_pci: fix virtio spec compliance on restore

On restore, virtio pci does the following:
+ set features
+ init vqs etc - device can be used at this point!
+ set ACKNOWLEDGE,DRIVER and DRIVER_OK status bits

This is in violation of the virtio spec, which
requires the following order:
- ACKNOWLEDGE
- DRIVER
- init vqs
- DRIVER_OK

This behaviour will break with hypervisors that assume spec compliant
behaviour.  It seems like a good idea to have this patch applied to
stable branches to reduce the support butden for the hypervisors.
