x86/efi: Mark initialization code as such

The 32 bit and 64 bit implementations differ in their __init annotations
for some functions referenced from the common EFI code. Namely, the 32
bit variant is missing some of the __init annotations the 64 bit variant
has.

To solve the colliding annotations, mark the corresponding functions in
efi_32.c as initialization code, too -- as it is such.

Actually, quite a few more functions are only used during initialization
and therefore can be marked __init. They are therefore annotated, too.
Also add the __init annotation to the prototypes in the efi.h header so
users of those functions will see it's meant as initialization code
only.

This patch also fixes the "prelog" typo. ("prologue" / "epilogue" might
be more appropriate but this is C code after all, not an opera! :D)
