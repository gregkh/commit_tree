PM / sleep: Mechanism for aborting system suspends unconditionally

It sometimes may be necessary to abort a system suspend in
progress or wake up the system from suspend-to-idle even if the
pm_wakeup_event()/pm_stay_awake() mechanism is not enabled.

For this purpose, introduce a new global variable pm_abort_suspend
and make pm_wakeup_pending() check its value.  Also add routines
for manipulating that variable.
