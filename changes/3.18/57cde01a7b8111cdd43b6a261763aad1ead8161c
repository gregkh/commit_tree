storage: Add quirks for Castlewood and Double-H USB-SCSI converters

Castlewood Systems supplied various models of USB-SCSI converter with their
ORB external removable-media drive. The ORB Windows and Macintosh drivers
support six USB IDs:
 084B:A001     [VID 084B is Castlewood Systems]
 04E6:0002 (*) ORB USB Smart Cable P/N 88205-001 (generic SCM ID)
 2027:A001     Double-H Technology DH-2000SC
 1822:0001 (*) Ariston iConnect/iSCSI
 07AF:0004 (*) Microtech XpressSCSI (25-pin)
 07AF:0005 (*) Microtech XpressSCSI (50-pin)

*: quirk already in unusual-devs.h

[Apparently the official VID for Double-H Technology is 0x07EB = 2027
decimal. That's another hex/decimal mix-up with these SCM-based products
(in addition to the Ariston and Entrega ones). Perhaps the USB-IF informed
companies of their allocated VID in decimal, but they assumed it was hex?
It seems all Entrega products used VID 0x1645, not just the USB-SCSI
converter.]

Double-H Technology Co., Ltd. produced a USB-SCSI converter, model
DH-2000SC, which is probably the one supported by the ORB drivers. Perhaps
the Castlewood-bundled product had a different label or PID though?
Castlewood mentioned Conmate as being one type of USB-SCSI converter.
Conmate and Double-H seem related somehow; both company addresses in the
same road, and at one point the Conmate web site mentioned DH-2000H4,
DH-200D4/DH-2000C4 as models of USB hub (DH short for Double-H presumably).
Conmate did show a USB-SCSI converter model CM-660 on their web site at one
point. My guess is that was identical to the DH-2000SC.

Mention of the Double-H product:

The only picture I could find is at

The casing design looks the same as my ORB USB Smart Cable which has ID
04E6:0002.

Anyway, that's enough rambling. Here's the patch.

storage: Add quirks for Castlewood and Double-H USB-SCSI converters

Add quirks for two SCM-based USB-SCSI converters which were bundled with
some Castlewood ORB removable drives. Without the quirk only the (single)
drive with SCSI ID 0 can be accessed.
