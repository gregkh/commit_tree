rcu: More on deadlock between CPU hotplug and expedited grace periods

Commit dd56af42bd82 (rcu: Eliminate deadlock between CPU hotplug and
expedited grace periods) was incomplete.  Although it did eliminate
deadlocks involving synchronize_sched_expedited()'s acquisition of
cpu_hotplug.lock via get_online_cpus(), it did nothing about the similar
deadlock involving acquisition of this same lock via put_online_cpus().
This deadlock became apparent with testing involving hibernation.

This commit therefore changes put_online_cpus() acquisition of this lock
to be conditional, and increments a new cpu_hotplug.puts_pending field
in case of acquisition failure.  Then cpu_hotplug_begin() checks for this
new field being non-zero, and applies any changes to cpu_hotplug.refcount.
