cpufreq: powernv: Set the cpus to nominal frequency during reboot/kexec

This patch ensures the cpus to kexec/reboot at nominal frequency.
Nominal frequency is the highest cpu frequency on PowerPC at
which the cores can run without getting throttled.

If the host kernel had set the cpus to a low pstate and then it
kexecs/reboots to a cpufreq disabled kernel it would cause the target
kernel to perform poorly. It will also increase the boot up time of
the target kernel. So set the cpus to high pstate, in this case to
nominal frequency before rebooting to avoid such scenarios.

The reboot notifier will set the cpus to nominal frequncy.
