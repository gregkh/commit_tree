staging: comedi: adl_pci9118: use dma_alloc_coherent()

Use `dma_alloc_coherent()` to allocate the DMA buffers instead of
using `__get_free_pages()` to allocate and `virt_to_bus()` to get the
hardware address.  The coherent buffers are fairly small - at most 4
pages (although there are two of them).  Use of `virt_to_bus()` is
discouraged.
