d rm/i915: freeze display before the interrupts and GT

Since we started using intel_runtime_pm_disable_interrupts() at normal
(non-runtime) suspend/resume, we had to remove a WARN from
ironlake_disable_display_irq to avoid a case where we were doing the
correct thing and the WARN was not really needed. The problem is that
the WARN was useful in other cases, and its removal can hide some bugs
that we would catch automatically.

To be able to add back the WARN, we have to call intel_crtc_control()
before interrupts are disabled, which is what this patch currently
does.

Also notice that Ville's patch from the Watermarks series "drm/i915:
Leave interrupts enabled while disabling crtcs during suspend" also
did a change that's equivalent to the one we're doing on this patch,
with the exception that its original patch, when applied to the
current tree, procduces a WARN.
