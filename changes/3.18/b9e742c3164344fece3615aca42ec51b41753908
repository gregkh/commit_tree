clk: tegra: Make clock initialization more robust

Don't abort clock initialization if we cannot match an entry in
tegra_clk_init_table to a valid entry in the clk array.

Also log a corresponding error message.

This was discovered when testing a patch that removed the EMC clock from
tegra124_clks but left a mention in tegra_clk_init_table.
