powerpc/pseries: Decrease message level on EEH initialization

As Anton suggested, the patch decreases the message level on EEH
initialization to avoid unnecessary messages if required. Also,
we have unified hint if any of needful RTAS calls is missed, and
then we can check /proc/device-tree to figure out the missed RTAS
calls.
