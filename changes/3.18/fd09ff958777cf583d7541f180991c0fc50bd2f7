rtlwifi: Remove extra workqueue for enter/leave power state

When the rtlwifi family of drivers was converted to use a workqueue when
entering or leaving power save mode (commits a269913c52, a5ffbe0a19,
41affd5286, b9116b9a2b, and 6539306b2c), the code began scheduling work from
the callback routine of a different workqueue with a resulting increase in
overhead.
