ARM: shmobile: r8a7778: Update DTS to include CPU frequency

Add CPU Frequency information to the r8a7778 DTS file. This
will allow us to use the shared C code on r8a7778 and BockW
which reads out the clock frequency from DT and calculates the
delay settings from there.

Also add other missing CPU information to the r8a7778 DTS.
