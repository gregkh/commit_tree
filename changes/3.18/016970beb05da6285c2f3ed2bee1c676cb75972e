drm/i915: Sharing platform specific sequence between runtime and system suspend/ resume paths

On VLV, post S0i3 during i915_drm_thaw following issue is observed during ring
initialization.

This is happening since wake is not enabled and Gunit registers are not restored.
For this system suspend/resume paths need to follow save/restore and additional
platform specific setup in suspend_complete and resume_prepare.

suspend_complete is shared unconditionaly for VLV, HSW, BDW. resume_prepare for
HSW and BDW has pc8 disabling which is needed during thaw_early so sharing
uncondtionally. For VLV and SNB runtime resume specific sequence exists.
