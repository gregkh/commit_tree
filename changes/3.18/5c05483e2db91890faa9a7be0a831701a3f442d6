ARC: [nsimosci] Allow "headless" models to boot

There are certain test configuration of virtual platform which don't
have any real console device (uart/pgu). So add tty0 as a fallback console
device to allow system to boot and be accessible via telnet

Otherwise with ttyS0 as only console, but 8250 disabled in kernel build,
init chokes.
