aarch64: filter $x from kallsyms

Similar to ARM, AArch64 is generating $x and $d syms... which isn't
terribly helpful when looking at %pF output and the like. Filter those
out in kallsyms, modpost and when looking at module symbols.

Seems simplest since none of these check EM_ARM anyway, to just add it
to the strchr used, rather than trying to make things overly
complicated.

initcall_debug improves:
dmesg_before.txt: initcall $x+0x0/0x154 [sg] returned 0 after 26331 usecs
dmesg_after.txt: initcall init_sg+0x0/0x154 [sg] returned 0 after 15461 usecs
