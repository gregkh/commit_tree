uas: Simplify unlink of data urbs on error

There is no need for all the trickery with dropping the lock, we can
simply reference the urbs while we hold the lock to ensure the urbs don't
disappear beneath us, and do the actual unlink (+ unreference) after we've
dropped the lock.

This also fixes a race where we may loose of cmnd ownership to the scsi
midlayer without holding the lock due to the midlayer re-claiming ownership
through an abort (which will be handled by a future patch in this series).
