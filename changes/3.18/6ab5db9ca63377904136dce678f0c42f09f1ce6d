staging: comedi: adv_pci_dio: remove 'valid' member from private data

This member is set at the end of the driver attach and is only used to
verify that pci_dio_reset() can be called in the (*detach). The only
requirement for pci_dio_reset() to work is that the dev->iobase is valid.

Remove the 'valid' member from the private data and use 'dev->iobase' to
see if the reset can be done.
