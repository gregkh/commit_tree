regulator: core: add guard delay between calling regulator_disable and _enable

Some regulator require a minimum delay between its disable and next enable.
This is to avoid damages when out-of-range frequent disable/enable of a
single regulator can bring to the regulator chip.

Add @off_on_delay to struct regulator_desc. Device drivers' can use this field
to set this guard time.

Add @last_off_jiffy to struct regulator_dev. When @off_on_delay is set by
driver, regulator core can store its last off (disable) time into this field.
