ath10k: flush hif buffers before recovery

Transport buffers weren't flushed and processed
before queueing hw recovery request to mac80211.

This could in theory result in an unwanted htt/wmi
rx events being processed while mac80211 recovers
the device and possibly interfere or even crash
the system.
