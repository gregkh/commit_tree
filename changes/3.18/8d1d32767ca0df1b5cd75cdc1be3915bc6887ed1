drivers: dma: Mark functions as static in dma_v3.c

Mark the functions ioat3_prep_xor_val(), ioat3_prep_pq_val() and
ioat3_prep_pqxor_val() as static in dma_v3.c because they are not used
outside this file.

This eliminates the following warnings in dma_v3.c:
drivers/dma/ioat/dma_v3.c:741:1: warning: no previous prototype for ‘ioat3_prep_xor_val’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/dma/ioat/dma_v3.c:1092:1: warning: no previous prototype for ‘ioat3_prep_pq_val’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
drivers/dma/ioat/dma_v3.c:1134:1: warning: no previous prototype for ‘ioat3_prep_pqxor_val’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
