pnfs: remove GETDEVICELIST implementation

The current GETDEVICELIST implementation is buggy in that it doesn't handle
cursors correctly, and in that it returns an error if the server returns
NFSERR_NOTSUPP.  Given that there is no actual need for GETDEVICELIST,
it has various issues and might get removed for NFSv4.2 stop using it in
the blocklayout driver, and thus the Linux NFS client as whole.
