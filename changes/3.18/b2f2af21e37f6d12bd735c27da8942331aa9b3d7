net: dsa: allow enabling and disable switch ports

Whenever a per-port network device is used/unused, invoke the switch
driver port_enable/port_disable callbacks to allow saving as much power
as possible by disabling unused parts of the switch (RX/TX logic, memory
arrays, PHYs...). We supply a PHY device argument to make sure the
switch driver can act on the PHY device if needed (like putting/taking
the PHY out of deep low power mode).
