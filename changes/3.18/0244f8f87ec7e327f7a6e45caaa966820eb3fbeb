dt/documentation: add specification of dma bus information

Recently we introduced the generic device tree infrastructure for couple of DMA
bus parameter, dma-ranges and dma-coherent. Update the documentation so that
its useful for future users.

The "dma-ranges" property is intended to be used for describing the
configuration of DMA bus RAM addresses and its offset w.r.t CPU addresses.

The "dma-coherent" property is intended to be used for identifying devices
supported coherent DMA operations.
