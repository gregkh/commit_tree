staging: et131x: Simplify code in nic_rx_pkts() for multicast_pkts_rcvd

In nic_rx_pkts(), we check that a multicast packet received (when using
a multicast list) is one that was requested - despite setting the list
up with the hardware. We shouldn't expect to get a mc packet we didn't
ask for, so remove these extra checks.

This also means that the surrounding code can be tiedied up a little.

Tested somewhat with omping, with no adverse effects seen.

Also remove this item from the TODO list.
