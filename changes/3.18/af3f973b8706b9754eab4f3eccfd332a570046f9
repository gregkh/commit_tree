ARM: dts: hummingboard: gpio-ir on gpio 3,5

HummingBoard after rev 2.0 and the production one starting rev 3.0 uses
gpio 3,5 (EIM_DA5 pad) as the gpio infra red receiver input.

Since the original Carrier1 board is obsolete and we are retiring it,
update the DT file for this.  This will mean IR reception will not
work on Carrier1 with this DT file.
