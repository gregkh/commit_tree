drm/tilcdc: Fix the error path in tilcdc_load()

The current error path calls tilcdc_unload() in case of an error to release
the resources. However, this is wrong because not all resources have been
allocated by the time an error occurs in tilcdc_load().

To fix it, this commit adds proper labels to bail out at the different
stages in the load function, and release only the resources actually allocated.
