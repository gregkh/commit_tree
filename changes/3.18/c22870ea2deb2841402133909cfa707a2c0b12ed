mfsymlinks support for SMB2.1/SMB3. Part 2 query symlink

Adds support on SMB2.1 and SMB3 mounts for emulation of symlinks
via the "Minshall/French" symlink format already used for cifs
mounts when mfsymlinks mount option is used (and also used by Apple).

This second patch adds support to query them (recognize them as symlinks
and read them).  Third version of patch makes minor corrections
to error handling.
