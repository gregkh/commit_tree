X.509: If available, use the raw subjKeyId to form the key description

Module signing matches keys by comparing against the key description exactly.
However, the way the key description gets constructed got changed to be
composed of the subject name plus the certificate serial number instead of the
subject name and the subjectKeyId.  I changed this to avoid problems with
certificates that don't *have* a subjectKeyId.

Instead, if available, use the raw subjectKeyId to form the key description
and only use the serial number if the subjectKeyId doesn't exist.
