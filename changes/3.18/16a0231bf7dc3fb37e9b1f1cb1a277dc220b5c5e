vti6: Use vti6_dev_init as the ndo_init function.

vti6_dev_init() sets the dev->iflink via a call to
vti6_link_config(). After that, register_netdevice()
sets dev->iflink = -1. So we loose the iflink configuration
for vti6 tunnels. Fix this by using vti6_dev_init() as the
ndo_init function. Then vti6_dev_init() is called after
dev->iflink is set to -1 from register_netdevice().
