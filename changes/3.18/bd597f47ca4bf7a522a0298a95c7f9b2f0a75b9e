devicetree: Dialog Semiconductor consolidate existing vendor prefixes to standardise on 'dlg'

This patch series updates the device tree vendor prefix for
Dialog Semiconductor.

Various methods are currently used throughout the kernel: 'diasemi',
'dialog' and 'dlg'. Others have also been suggested.

This patch set aims to consolidate the usage of the vendor prefix to
use a common standard. The prefix 'dlg' is used.
