PCI: designware: Fold struct pcie_port_info into struct pcie_port

The struct pcie_port_info doesn't contain any exclusive information
compared to other elements of struct pcie_port.  So, keeping a separate
structure does not seem very logical.  Therefore remove this struct and
embed its elements directly into struct pcie_port.
