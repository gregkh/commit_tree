netfilter: nf_nat: generalize IPv6 masquerading support for nf_tables

Let's refactor the code so we can reach the masquerade functionality
from outside the xt context (ie. nftables).

The patch includes the addition of an atomic counter to the masquerade
notifier: the stuff to be done by the notifier is the same for xt and
nftables. Therefore, only one notification handler is needed.

This factorization only involves IPv6; a similar patch exists to
handle IPv4.
