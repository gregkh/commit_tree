fm10k: Add support for MACVLAN acceleration

This patch adds support for L2 MACVLAN by making use of the fact that the
RRC provides a unique tag per filter called a Global Resource Tag, or GLORT.
In the case of this offload what I have done is assigned a linear block of
these so that each GLORT represents one of the MACVLAN netdevs.  By doing
this I can share the Rx queues and Tx queues for all of the MACVLAN netdevs
while allowing them to be demuxed in the Rx cleanup path.
