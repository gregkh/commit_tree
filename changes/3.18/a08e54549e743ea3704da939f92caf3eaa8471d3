NFC: trf7970a: Initialize when enabling RF

Currently, the trf7970a is reset & initialized only
when the pm_runtime resume hook is called.  Instead,
initialize it every time the RF is enabled to ensure
that the trf7970a is quiesced and in a known state
before being set up for another RF technology.
