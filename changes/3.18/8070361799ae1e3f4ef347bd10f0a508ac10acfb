s390: add support for vector extension

The vector extension introduces 32 128-bit vector registers and a set of
instruction to operate on the vector registers.

The kernel can control the use of vector registers for the problem state
program with a bit in control register 0. Once enabled for a process the
kernel needs to retain the content of the vector registers on context
switch. The signal frame is extended to include the vector registers.
Two new register sets NT_S390_VXRS_LOW and NT_S390_VXRS_HIGH are added
to the regset interface for the debugger and core dumps.
