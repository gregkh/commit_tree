MIPS: asm: uaccess: Add v1 register to clobber list on EVA

When EVA is turned on and prefetching is being used in memcpy.S,
the v1 register is being used as a helper register to the PREFE
instruction. However, v1 ($3) was not in the clobber list, which
means that the compiler did not preserve it across function calls,
and that could corrupt the value of the register leading to all
sorts of userland crashes. We fix this problem by using the
DADDI_SCRATCH macro to define the clobbered register when
CONFIG_EVA && CONFIG_CPU_HAS_PREFETCH are enabled.
