ARM: dts: vf610-colibri: Add USB support

Add USB support for Colibri VF61 modules. The Colibri standard pinout
defines a pin for USB over-current. However, due to lack of pinmux
options, the USB hosts over-current protection signal of the Colibri
standard could not be connected to the PHY's over-current protection.
Hence we need to disable the over-current functionality of the USB
controller.
