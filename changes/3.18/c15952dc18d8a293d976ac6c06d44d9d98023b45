net: filter: move common defines into bpf_common.h

userspace programs that use eBPF instruction macros need to include two files:
uapi/linux/filter.h and uapi/linux/bpf.h
Move common macro definitions that are shared between classic BPF and eBPF
into uapi/linux/bpf_common.h, so that user app can include only one bpf.h file
