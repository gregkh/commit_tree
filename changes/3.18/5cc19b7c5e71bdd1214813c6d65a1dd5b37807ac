Input: palmas-pwrbutton - use IRQF_ONESHOT

Reports:
drivers/input/misc/palmas-pwrbutton.c:213:9-29: ERROR: Threaded IRQ with no primary handler requested without IRQF_ONESHOT

Palmas power button just needs threaded IRQ handler since I2C operations
are involved and there is nothing in non-threaded primary handler we could
do.

So mark the request with ONESHOT as it should have been done in these
cases.
