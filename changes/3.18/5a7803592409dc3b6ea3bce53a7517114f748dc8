staging: comedi: add comedi_handle_events()

The "comedi_fc" module contains a few functions useful to Comedi
drivers.  Their functionality is being migrated to the core "comedi"
module and renamed to start with the prefix `comedi_`.  As part of this
migration, move `cfc_handle_events()` into the core comedi module and
rename it to `comedi_handle_events()`.  Change the external declaration
of `cfc_handle_events()` into an inline function that calls
`comedi_handle_events()`.
