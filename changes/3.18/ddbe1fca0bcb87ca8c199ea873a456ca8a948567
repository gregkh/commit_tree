USB: Add device quirk for ASUS T100 Base Station keyboard

This full-speed USB device generates spurious remote wakeup event
as soon as USB_DEVICE_REMOTE_WAKEUP feature is set. As the result,
Linux can't enter system suspend and S0ix power saving modes once
this keyboard is used.

This patch tries to introduce USB_QUIRK_IGNORE_REMOTE_WAKEUP quirk.
With this quirk set, wakeup capability will be ignored during
device configure.

This patch could be back-ported to kernels as old as 2.6.39.
