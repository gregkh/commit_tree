ima: detect violations for mmaped files

This patch fixes the detection of the 'open_writers' violation for mmaped
files.

before) an 'open_writers' violation is detected if the policy contains
        a rule with the criteria: func=FILE_CHECK mask=MAY_READ

after) an 'open_writers' violation is detected if the current event
       matches one of the policy rules.

With the old behaviour, the 'open_writers' violation is not detected
in the following case:

policy:
measure func=FILE_MMAP mask=MAY_EXEC

steps:
1) open a shared library for writing
2) execute a binary that links that shared library
3) during the binary execution, modify the shared library and save
   the change

result:
the 'open_writers' violation measurement is not present in the IMA list.

Only binaries executed are protected from writes. For libraries mapped
in memory there is the flag MAP_DENYWRITE for this purpose, but according
to the output of 'man mmap', the mmap flag is ignored.

Since ima_rdwr_violation_check() is now called by process_measurement()
the information about if the inode must be measured is already provided
by ima_get_action(). Thus the unnecessary function ima_must_measure()
has been removed.

Changes in v3 (Dmitry Kasatkin):
- Violation for MMAP_CHECK function are verified since this patch
- Changed patch description a bit
