extcon: max77693: Fix a bug occured at changing ADC debounce time.

When it writes some value other than 0 to BTLDset and JIGset, muic device
will be reset automatically. And it happens during updating ADC debounce time,
because it shares same register. To update ADC debounce time without reset,
set value only to ADCDbset and 0 to BTLDset and JIGset.
