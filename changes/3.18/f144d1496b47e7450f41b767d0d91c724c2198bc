PCI/MSI: Add device flag indicating that 64-bit MSIs don't work

This can be set by quirks/drivers to be used by the architecture code
that assigns the MSI addresses.

We additionally add verification in the core MSI code that the values
assigned by the architecture do satisfy the limitation in order to fail
gracefully if they don't (ie. the arch hasn't been updated to deal with
that quirk yet).
