locks: fix fcntl_setlease/getlease return when !CONFIG_FILE_LOCKING

Currently they both just return 0. Fix them to return more appropriate
values instead.

For better or worse, most places in the kernel return -EINVAL when
leases aren't available. -ENOLCK would probably have been better, but
let's follow suit here in the case of F_SETLEASE.

In the F_GETLEASE case, just return F_UNLCK since we know that no
lease will have been set.
