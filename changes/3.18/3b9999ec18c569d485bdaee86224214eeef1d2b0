Staging: vt6656: Merge two lines of code into one

This patch merges an assignment with an immediately following return of
the assigned variable. The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used
to make this transformation:

@@
expression ret;
identifier f;
@@

-ret=
+return
	f(...);
-return ret;

A variable that became unused due to this transformation was also
removed.
