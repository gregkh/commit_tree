mmc: sdhci-msm: Make tuning block table endian agnostic

If we're tuning on a big-endian CPU we'll never determine we properly
tuned the device because we compare the data we received from the
controller with a table that assumes the CPU is little-endian.
Change the table to be an array of bytes instead of 32-bit words
so we can use memcmp() without needing to byte-swap every word
depending on the endianess of the CPU.
