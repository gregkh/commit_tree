percpu: remove the usage of separate populated bitmap in percpu-vm

percpu-vm uses pcpu_get_pages_and_bitmap() to acquire temp pages array
and populated bitmap and uses the two during [de]population.  The temp
bitmap is used only to build the new bitmap that is copied to
chunk->populated after the operation succeeds; however, the new bitmap
can be trivially set after success without using the temp bitmap.

This patch removes the temp populated bitmap usage from percpu-vm.c.

* pcpu_get_pages_and_bitmap() is renamed to pcpu_get_pages() and no
  longer hands out the temp bitmap.

* @populated arugment is dropped from all the related functions.
  @populated updates in pcpu_[un]map_pages() are dropped.

* Two loops in pcpu_map_pages() are merged.

* pcpu_[de]populated_chunk() modify chunk->populated bitmap directly
  from @page_start and @page_end after success.
