tty: Fix width of unsigned long bitfield padding

Commit c545b66c6922b002b5fe224a6eaec58c913650b5,
'tty: Serialize tcflow() with other tty flow control changes' and
commit 99416322dd16b810ba74098cc50ef2a844091d35,
'tty: Workaround Alpha non-atomic byte storage in tty_struct' work around
compiler bugs and non-atomic storage on multiple arches by padding
bitfields out to the declared type which is unsigned long. However, the
width varies by arch.

Pad bitfields to actual width of unsigned long (which is BITS_PER_LONG).
