percpu: Resolve ambiguities in __get_cpu_var/cpumask_var_t -fix

A commit in linux-next was causing boot to fail and bisection
identified the patch 4ba2968420fa ("percpu: Resolve ambiguities in
__get_cpu_var/cpumask_var_").  One of the changes in that patch looks
very suspicious.  Reverting the full patch fixes boot as does this
fixlet.
