drm/i915: Fix edp vdd locking

Introduce a new mutex (pps_mutex) to protect the power sequencer
state. For now this state includes want_panel_vdd as well as the
power sequencer registers.

We need a single mutex (as opposed to per port) because later on we
will need to deal with VLV/CHV which have multiple power sequencer
which can be reassigned to different ports.

v2: Add the locking to intel_dp_encoder_suspend too (Imre)
v3: Take care intel_edp_backlight_power() and
    _intel_edp_backlight_on/off(), deal with reboot notifier
    vlv_power_sequencer_pipe() call (Imre)
