target: Change core_dev_del_lun to take a se_lun instead of unpacked_lun

Remove core_tpg_pre_dellun entirely, since we don't need to get/check
a pointer we already have.

Nothing else can return an error, so core_dev_del_lun can return void.

Rename core_tpg_post_dellun to remove_lun - a clearer name, now that
pre_dellun is gone.
