zram: avoid NULL pointer access in concurrent situation

There is a rare NULL pointer bug in mem_used_total_show() and
mem_used_max_store() in concurrent situation, like this:

zram is not initialized, process A is a mem_used_total reader which runs
periodically, while process B try to init zram.

	process A 				process B
  access meta, get a NULL value
						init zram, done
  init_done() is true
  access meta->mem_pool, get a NULL pointer BUG

This patch fixes this issue.
