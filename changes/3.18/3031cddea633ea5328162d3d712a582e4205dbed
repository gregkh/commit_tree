ACPI / SBS: Don't assume the existence of an SBS charger

Apple hardware continues to expose an ACPI AC charger even when using
SBS to report battery state. The charger status byte returns all 0s in
this case.  Since the spec requires that bit 4 be 1 at all times, assume
that there's not really a charger if it's set to zero.
