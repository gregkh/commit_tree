udp-tunnel: Add a few more UDP tunnel APIs

Added a few more UDP tunnel APIs that can be shared by UDP based
tunnel protocol implementation. The main ones are highlighted below.

setup_udp_tunnel_sock() configures UDP listener socket for
receiving UDP encapsulated packets.

udp_tunnel_xmit_skb() and upd_tunnel6_xmit_skb() transmit skb
using UDP encapsulation.

udp_tunnel_sock_release() closes the UDP tunnel listener socket.
