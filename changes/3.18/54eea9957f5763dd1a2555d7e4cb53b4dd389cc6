x86_64, entry: Treat regs->ax the same in fastpath and slowpath syscalls

For slowpath syscalls, we initialize regs->ax to -ENOSYS and stick
the syscall number into regs->orig_ax prior to any possible tracing
and syscall execution.  This is user-visible ABI used by ptrace
syscall emulation and seccomp.

For fastpath syscalls, there's no good reason not to do the same
thing.  It's even slightly simpler than what we're currently doing.
It probably has no measureable performance impact.  It should have
no user-visible effect.

The purpose of this patch is to prepare for two-phase syscall
tracing, in which the first phase might modify the saved RAX without
leaving the fast path.  This change is just subtle enough that I'm
keeping it separate.
