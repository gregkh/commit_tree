HID: Add Holtek USB ID 04d9:a0c2 ETEKCITY Scroll

The report descriptor for the HOLTEK USB ID 04d9:a0c2 (ETEKCITY Scroll
T-140 Gaming Mouse) is set to a very large amount of consumer usages
(2^16), exceeding HID_MAX_USAGES. Added id, bindings and comments for
the mouse, added to hid_have_special_driver, and reduced the usage and
logical maximums to 0x2fff, consistent with the other mice in the
category. Tested on the hardware.
