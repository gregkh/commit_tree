ixgbe: Correctly disable VLAN filter in promiscuous mode

IXGBE adapter seems to require that VLAN filtering be enabled if
VMDQ or SRIOV are enabled.  When those functions are disabled,
VLAN filtering may be disabled in promiscuous mode.

Prior to commit a9b8943ee129 ("ixgbe: remove vlan_filter_disable
and enable functions")

The logic was correct.  However, after the commit the logic
got reversed and VLAN filtered in now turned on when VMDQ/SRIOV
is disabled.

This patch changes the condition to enable hw vlan filtered
when VMDQ or SRIOV is enabled.

Fixes: a9b8943ee129 ("ixgbe: remove vlan_filter_disable and enable functions")
