mmc: sdhci-acpi: Fix Braswell eMMC timeout clock frequency

Braswell eMMC host controller specifies an incorrect
timeout clock frequncy in the capabilities registers.
The correct value is 1 MHz.  A similar fix was done
for sdhci-pci, however in the sdhci-acpi case the
HID/UID is not unique so the capabilities register
values are matched also.
