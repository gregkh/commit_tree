xhci: Disable streams on Asmedia 1042 xhci controllers

Streams seem to be broken on the Asmedia 1042. An uas capable Seagate disk
which is known to work fine with other controllers causes the system to freeze
when connected over usb-3 with this controller, where as it works fine with
uas in usb-2 ports, indicating a problem with streams.

This is a bit bigger hammer then I would like to use for this, but for now it
will have to make do. I've ordered a pci-e usb controller card with an Asmedia
1042, once that arrives I'll try to get streams to work (with a quirk flag if
necessary) and then we can re-enable them. For now this at least makes uas
capable disk enclosures work again by forcing fallback to the usb-storage
driver.
