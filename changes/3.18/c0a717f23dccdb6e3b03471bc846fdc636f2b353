x86, microcode, AMD: Fix ucode patch stashing on 32-bit

Save the patch while we're running on the BSP instead of later, before
the initrd has been jettisoned. More importantly, on 32-bit we need to
access the physical address instead of the virtual.

This way we actually do find it on the APs instead of having to go
through the initrd each time.
