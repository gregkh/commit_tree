mmc: Add .multi_io_quirk callback for multi I/O HW bug

Historically, we have been using MMC_CAP* to handle host HW issues and
currently the block layer uses MMC_CAP2_NO_MULTI_READ flag for a multi
I/O HW bug workaround.

There are a few tweaks needed to make MMC_CAP2_NO_MULTI_READ suite all
situations. Therefore let's add an optional host ops callback to enable
host drivers to return the number of blocks it allows per request.

In a future patch and when host drivers have converted to the new
callback, MMC_CAP2_NO_MULTI_READ shall be removed.
