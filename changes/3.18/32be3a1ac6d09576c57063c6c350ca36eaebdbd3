btrfs: Fix the wrong condition judgment about subset extent map

Previous commit: btrfs: Fix and enhance merge_extent_mapping() to insert
best fitted extent map
is using wrong condition to judgement whether the range is a subset of a
existing extent map.

This may cause bug in btrfs no-holes mode.

This patch will correct the judgment and fix the bug.
