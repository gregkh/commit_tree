tty: Serialize tty flow control changes with flow_lock

Without serialization, the flow control state can become inverted
wrt. the actual hardware state. For example,

CPU 0                          | CPU 1
stop_tty()                     |
  lock ctrl_lock               |
  tty->stopped = 1             |
  unlock ctrl_lock             |
                               | start_tty()
                               |   lock ctrl_lock
                               |   tty->stopped = 0
                               |   unlock ctrl_lock
                               |   driver->start()
  driver->stop()               |

In this case, the flow control state now indicates the tty has
been started, but the actual hardware state has actually been stopped.

Introduce tty->flow_lock spinlock to serialize tty flow control changes.
Split out unlocked __start_tty()/__stop_tty() flavors for use by
ioctl(TCXONC) in follow-on patch.
