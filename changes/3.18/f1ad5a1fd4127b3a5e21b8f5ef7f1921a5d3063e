drm/i915/bdw: Help out the ctx switch interrupt handler

If we receive a storm of requests for the same context (see gem_storedw_loop_*)
we might end up iterating over too many elements in interrupt time, looking for
contexts to squash together. Instead, share the burden by giving more
intelligence to the queue function. At most, the interrupt will iterate over
three elements.
