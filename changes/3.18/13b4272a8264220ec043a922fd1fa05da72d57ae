NFC: trf7970a: Add Target Mode Support

Add target mode support to the trf7970a
NFC driver.  This effectively enables full
Peer-to-Peer support.

To handle changing framing between sending
a response frame and receiving the subsequent
request frame, most of the framing changes
take effect in the interrupt handler and not
in trf7970a_tg_config_framing().
