lpfc: mark functions as static in lpfc/lpfc_sli.c

[PATCH 22/55] scsi: Mark functions as static in lpfc/lpfc_sli.c

Mark functions as static in lpfc/lpfc_sli.c because they are not used
outside this file.

This eliminates the following warnings in lpfc/lpfc_sli.c:
drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_sli.c:13867:1: warning: no previous prototype for ‘lpfc_sli4_alloc_xri’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
