net: dsa: bcm_sf2: add port_enable/disable callbacks

The SF2 switch driver is already architected around per-port
enable/disable callbacks, so we just need a slight update to our
existing bcm_sf2_port_setup() resp. bcm_sf2_port_disable() functions to
be suitable as callbacks for port_enable/port_disable.

We need to shuffle a little the code that does the per-port VLAN
configuration/isolation since ports can now be brought up/down
separately, so we need to make sure that IMP (CPU, management) port is
always included in that specific port setup.
