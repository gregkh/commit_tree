x86 / PM: Set IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE for IOAPIC IRQ chip objects

Set the IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE for IOAPIC IRQ chip objects so that
interrupts from them can work as wakeup interrupts for suspend-to-idle.

After this change, running enable_irq_wake() on one of the IRQs in
question will succeed and IRQD_WAKEUP_STATE will be set for it, so
all of the suspend-to-idle wakeup mechanics introduced previously
will work for it automatically.
