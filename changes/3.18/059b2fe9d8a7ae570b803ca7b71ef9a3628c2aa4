drm/i915: change CHV write_eld/global_resources function pointers

Currently, CHV is using the same functions as HSW/BDW instead of the
same functions as VLV. This looks wrong, especially since, for
example, valleyview_modeset_global_resouces even has an IS_CHERRYVIEW
check.

This patch has the potential to fix display audio and the CHV CDCLK.
