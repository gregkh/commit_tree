drm/i915/bdw: Render state init for Execlists

The batchbuffer that sets the render context state is submitted
in a different way, and from different places.

We needed to make both the render state preparation and free functions
outside accesible, and namespace accordingly. This mess is so that all
LR, LRC and Execlists functionality can go together in intel_lrc.c: we
can fix all of this later on, once the interfaces are clear.

v2: Create a separate ctx->rcs_initialized for the Execlists case, as
suggested by Chris Wilson.

v3: Setup ring status page in lr_context_deferred_create when the
default context is being created. This means that the render state
init for the default context is no longer a special case.  Execute
deferred creation of the default context at the end of
logical_ring_init to allow the render state commands to be submitted.
Fix style errors reported by checkpatch. Rebased.
