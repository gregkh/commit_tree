udp: Add support for doing checksum unnecessary conversion

Add support for doing CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY to CHECKSUM_COMPLETE
conversion in UDP tunneling path.

In the normal UDP path, we call skb_checksum_try_convert after locating
the UDP socket. The check is that checksum conversion is enabled for
the socket (new flag in UDP socket) and that checksum field is
non-zero.

In the UDP GRO path, we call skb_gro_checksum_try_convert after
checksum is validated and checksum field is non-zero. Since this is
already in GRO we assume that checksum conversion is always wanted.
