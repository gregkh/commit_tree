udf: Fix loading of special inodes

Some UDF media have special inodes (like VAT or metadata partition
inodes) whose link_count is 0. Thus commit 4071b9136223 (udf: Properly
detect stale inodes) broke loading these inodes because udf_iget()
started returning -ESTALE for them. Since we still need to properly
detect stale inodes queried by NFS, create two variants of udf_iget() -
one which is used for looking up special inodes (which ignores
link_count == 0) and one which is used for other cases which return
ESTALE when link_count == 0.
