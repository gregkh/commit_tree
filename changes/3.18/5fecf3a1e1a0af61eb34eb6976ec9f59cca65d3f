staging: android: logger: Fix log corruption regression

Since commit cd678fce4280 ("switch logger to ->write_iter()"), any
attempt to write to the log results in the log data being written over
its own metadata, thus rendering the log unreadable.

The problem was first detected when I ran an Android userspace on the
v3.18-rc1 kernel. However the issue can also be observed with a
non-Android userspace by using echo/cat to write to/from /dev/log_main .

This patch resolves the problem by using a temporary to track the status
of not-yet-committed writes to the log buffer.
