blk-timeout: fix blk_add_timer

Commit 8cb34819cdd5d(blk-mq: unshared timeout handler) introduces
blk-mq's own timeout handler, and removes following line:

	blk_queue_rq_timed_out(q, blk_mq_rq_timed_out);

which then causes blk_add_timer() to bypass adding the timer,
since blk-mq no longer has q->rq_timed_out_fn defined.

This patch fixes the problem by bypassing the check for blk-mq,
so that both request deadlines are still set and the rolling
timer updated.
