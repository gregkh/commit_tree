net: Remove gso_send_check as an offload callback

The send_check logic was only interesting in cases of TCP offload and
UDP UFO where the checksum needed to be initialized to the pseudo
header checksum. Now we've moved that logic into the related
gso_segment functions so gso_send_check is no longer needed.
