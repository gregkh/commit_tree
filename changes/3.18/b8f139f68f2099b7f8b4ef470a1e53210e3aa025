regulator/mfd: max14577: Export symbols for calculating charger current

This patch prepares for changing the max14577 charger driver to allow
configuring battery-dependent settings from DTS.

The patch moves from regulator driver to MFD core driver and exports:
 - function for calculating register value for charger's current;
 - table of limits for chargers (MAX14577, MAX77836).

Previously they were used only by the max14577 regulator driver. In next
patch the charger driver will use them as well. Exporting them will
reduce unnecessary code duplication.
