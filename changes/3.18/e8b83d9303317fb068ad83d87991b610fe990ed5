ext4: collapse ext4_convert_initialized_extents()

The function ext4_convert_initialized_extents() is only called by a
single function --- ext4_ext_convert_initalized_extents().  Inline the
code and get rid of the unnecessary bits in order to simplify the code.

Rename ext4_ext_convert_initalized_extents() to
convert_initalized_extents() since it's a static function that is
actually only used in a single caller, ext4_ext_map_blocks().
