staging: comedi: ni_labpc: split common code to ni_labpc_common

The "ni_labpc" module is a Comedi driver for the National Instruments
Lab-PC series of ISA data acquistion boards, and also provides common
code for the "ni_labpc_pci" and "ni_labpci_cs" modules (for PCI boards
and PCMCIA cards).

Split out the common code into a new module "ni_labpc_common", leaving
the driver for the ISA boards in the existing "ni_labpc" module.  This
removes the C preprocessor conditional directives from the resulting
".c" files (although they remain in the included header file
"ni_labpc_isadma.h").

Unneccessary `#include` directives have been removed from the resulting
".c" files.
