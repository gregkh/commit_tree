perf symbols: Don't try to find DSOs in SYSV maps

We are seeing a lot of the following with regards to SYSV memory

Failed to open /SYSV0000279c, continuing without symbols

We don't believe this memory will have DSO info, so treat it like the
heap and stack for now and skip it to prevent the warning.
