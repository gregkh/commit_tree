power: reset: driver for the Versatile syscon reboot

This driver enabled us to drive the reboot of the Versatile family
of ARM reference boards. Even though only the RealView boards are
supported initially, these boards all have the same procedure for
reboot:

- Write a magic value into an unlocking register
- Write another magic value into a reset control register

The driver will be reusable for Versatile and possibly also the
Integrator family of reference boards.
