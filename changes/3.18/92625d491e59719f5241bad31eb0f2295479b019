powerpc/8xx: Use SCRATCH0 and SCRATCH1 also for TLB handlers

SCRATCH0 and SCRATCH1 are only used in Exceptions prologs where no other
exception can happen. There is therefore no need to preserve them accross
TLB handlers, we can use them there as in other exceptions. One of the
advantages is that they do not suffer CPU6 errata unlike M_TW register.
