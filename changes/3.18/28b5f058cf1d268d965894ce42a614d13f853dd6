net: fec: ptp: fix convergence issue to support LinuxPTP stack

iMX6SX IEEE 1588 module has one hw issue in capturing the ATVR register.
The current SW flow is:
		ENET0->ATCR |= ENET_ATCR_CAPTURE_MASK;
		ts_counter_ns = ENET0->ATVR;
The ATVR value is not expected value that cause LinuxPTP stack cannot be convergent.

ENET Block Guide/ Chapter for the iMX6SX (PELE) address the issue:
After set ENET_ATCR[Capture], there need some time cycles before the counter
value is capture in the register clock domain. The wait-time-cycles is at least
6 clock cycles of the slower clock between the register clock and the 1588 clock.
So need something like:
		ENET0->ATCR |= ENET_ATCR_CAPTURE_MASK;
		wait();
		ts_counter_ns = ENET0->ATVR;

For iMX6SX, the 1588 ts_clk is fixed to 25Mhz, register clock is 66Mhz, so the
wait-time-cycles must be greater than 240ns (40ns * 6). The patch add 1us delay
before cpu read ATVR register.

Changes V2:
Modify the commit/comments log to describe the issue clearly.
