HID: input: Fix TransducerSerialNumber implementation

The commit which introduced TransducerSerialNumber (368c966) is missing
two crucial implementation details. Firstly, the commit does not set the
type/code/bit/max fields as expected later down the code which can cause
the driver to crash when a tablet with this usage is connected. Secondly,
the call to 'set_bit' causes MSC_PULSELED to be sent instead of the
expected MSC_SERIAL. This commit addreses both issues.
