HID: uhid: implement SET_REPORT

We so far lacked support for hid_hw_raw_request(..., HID_REQ_SET_REPORT);
Add support for it and simply forward the request to user-space. Note that
SET_REPORT is synchronous, just like GET_REPORT, even though it does not
provide any data back besides an error code.

If a transport layer does SET_REPORT asynchronously, they can just ACK it
immediately by writing an uhid_set_report_reply to uhid.

This patch re-uses the synchronous uhid-report infrastructure to query
user-space. Note that this means you cannot run SET_REPORT and GET_REPORT
in parallel. However, that has always been a restriction of HID and due to
its blocking nature, this is just fine. Maybe some future transport layer
supports parallel requests (very unlikely), however, until then lets not
over-complicate things and avoid request-lookup-tables.
