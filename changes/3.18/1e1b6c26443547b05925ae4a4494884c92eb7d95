KVM: x86: recalculate_apic_map after enabling apic

Currently, recalculate_apic_map ignores vcpus whose lapic is software disabled
through the spurious interrupt vector. However, once it is re-enabled, the map
is not recalculated. Therefore, if the guest OS configured DFR while lapic is
software-disabled, the map may be incorrect. This patch recalculates apic map
after software enabling the lapic.
