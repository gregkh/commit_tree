net: bpf: correctly handle errors in sk_attach_filter()

Commit "net: bpf: make eBPF interpreter images read-only" has changed bpf_prog
to be vmalloc()ed but never handled some of the errors paths of the old code.

On error within sk_attach_filter (which userspace can easily trigger), we'd
kfree() the vmalloc()ed memory, and leak the internal bpf_work_struct.
