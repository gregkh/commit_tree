rcu: Provide counterpart to rcu_dereference() for non-RCU situations

Although rcu_dereference() and friends can be used in situations where
object lifetimes are being managed by something other than RCU, the
resulting sparse and lockdep-RCU noise can be annoying.  This commit
therefore supplies a lockless_dereference(), which provides the
protection for dereferences without the RCU-related debugging noise.
