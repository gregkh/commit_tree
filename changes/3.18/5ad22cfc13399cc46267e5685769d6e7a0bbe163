uas: Remove support for old sense ui as used in pre-production hardware

I've access to a number of different uas devices now, and none of them use
old style sense urbs. The only case where these code-paths trigger is with
the asm1051 and there they do the wrong thing, as the asm1051 sends 8 bytes
status iu-s when it does not have any sense data, but uses new style
sense iu-s regardless, as can be seen for scsi cmnds where there is sense
data.
