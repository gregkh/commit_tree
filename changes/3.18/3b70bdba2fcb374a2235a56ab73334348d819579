ALSA: hda - Add workaround for CMI8888 snoop behavior

CMI8888 shows the stuttering playback when the snooping is disabled
on the audio buffer.  Meanwhile, we've got reports that CORB/RIRB
doesn't work in the snooped mode.  So, as a compromise, disable the
snoop only for CORB/RIRB and enable the snoop for the stream buffers.

The resultant patch became a bit ugly, unfortunately, but we still can
live with it.
