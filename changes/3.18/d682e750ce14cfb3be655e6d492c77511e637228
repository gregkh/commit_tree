nfsd: serialize nfsdcltrack upcalls for a particular client

In a later patch, we want to add a flag that will allow us to reduce the
need for upcalls. In order to handle that correctly, we'll need to
ensure that racing upcalls for the same client can't occur. In practice
it should be rare for this to occur with a well-behaved client, but it
is possible.

Convert one of the bits in the cl_flags field to be an upcall bitlock,
and use it to ensure that upcalls for the same client are serialized.
