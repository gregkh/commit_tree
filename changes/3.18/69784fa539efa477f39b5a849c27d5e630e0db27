	Multiple boot failures on ARM[1] were bisected down to this
	patch.

	How was this patch tested, and on which platforms?

	Also, the changelog states that this should be done only for
	UART_CAP_SLEEP, but the patch does it for every UART.

	Greg, I suggest this patch be dropped from tty-next until it has
	been better described and tested.
