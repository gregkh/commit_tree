efi: rtc-efi: Export platform:rtc-efi as module alias

When the rtc-efi driver is built as a module, we already register the
EFI rtc as a platform device if UEFI Runtime Services are enabled.
To wire it up to udev, and let the module be loaded automatically, we
need to export the 'platform:rtc-efi' alias from the module.
