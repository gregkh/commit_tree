btrfs compression: merge inflate and deflate z_streams

`struct workspace' used for zlib compression contains two zlib
z_stream-s: `def_strm' used in zlib_compress_pages(), and `inf_strm'
used in zlib_decompress/zlib_decompress_biovec(). None of these
functions use `inf_strm' and `def_strm' simultaniously, meaning that
for every compress/decompress operation we need only one z_stream
(out of two available).

`inf_strm' and `def_strm' are different in size of ->workspace. For
inflate stream we vmalloc() zlib_inflate_workspacesize() bytes, for
deflate stream - zlib_deflate_workspacesize() bytes. On my system zlib
returns the following workspace sizes, correspondingly: 42312 and 268104
(+ guard pages).

Keep only one `z_stream' in `struct workspace' and use it for both
compression and decompression. Hence, instead of vmalloc() of two
z_stream->worskpace-s, allocate only one of size:
	max(zlib_deflate_workspacesize(), zlib_inflate_workspacesize())
