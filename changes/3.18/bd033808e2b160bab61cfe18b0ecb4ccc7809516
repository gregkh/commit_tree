ASoC: sst-haswell-pcm: Alloc state struct in driver probe()

Resource allocations should happen in driver probe callback rather than in
snd_soc_platform probe functions. Especially if the resource is device
managed. The snd_soc_* probe/remove functions are mainly intended to be used
for things that require the component to be already bound to a card.
