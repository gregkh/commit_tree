drm/i915: Force CPU relocations if not GTT mapped

Move the decision on whether we need to have a mappable object during
execbuffer to the fore and then reuse that decision by propagating the
flag through to reservation. As a corollary, before doing the actual
relocation through the GTT, we can make sure that we do have a GTT
mapping through which to operate.

Note that the key to make this work is to ditch the
obj->map_and_fenceable unbind optimization - with full ppgtt it
doesn't make a lot of sense any more anyway.

v2: Revamp and resend to ease future patches.
v3: Refresh patch rationale
