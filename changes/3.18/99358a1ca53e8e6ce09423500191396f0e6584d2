[jffs2] kill wbuf_queued/wbuf_dwork_lock

schedule_delayed_work() happening when the work is already pending is
a cheap no-op.  Don't bother with ->wbuf_queued logics - it's both
broken (cancelling ->wbuf_dwork leaves it set, as spotted by Jeff Harris)
and pointless.  It's cheaper to let schedule_delayed_work() handle that
case.
