ata: qcom: Add device tree bindings information

Add device tree binding for Qualcomm AHCI SATA controller and specifically
the sata controller on the IPQ806x family of SoCs.

We can utilize the "generic-ahci" platform driver with the addition of the
sata phy to enable SATA support on Qualcomm SoCs with AHCI controllers.
