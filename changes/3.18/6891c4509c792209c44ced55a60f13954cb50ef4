posix-timers: Fix stack info leak in timer_create()

If userland creates a timer without specifying a sigevent info, we'll
create one ourself, using a stack local variable. Particularly will we
use the timer ID as sival_int. But as sigev_value is a union containing
a pointer and an int, that assignment will only partially initialize
sigev_value on systems where the size of a pointer is bigger than the
size of an int. On such systems we'll copy the uninitialized stack bytes
from the timer_create() call to userland when the timer actually fires
and we're going to deliver the signal.

Initialize sigev_value with 0 to plug the stack info leak.

Found in the PaX patch, written by the PaX Team.
