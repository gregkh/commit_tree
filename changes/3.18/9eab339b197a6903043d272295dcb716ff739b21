audit: get comm using lock to avoid race in string printing

When task->comm is passed directly to audit_log_untrustedstring() without
getting a copy or using the task_lock, there is a race that could happen that
would output a NULL (\0) in the output string that would effectively truncate
the rest of the report text after the comm= field in the audit, losing fields.

Use get_task_comm() to get a copy while acquiring the task_lock to prevent
this and to prevent the result from being a mixture of old and new values of
comm.
