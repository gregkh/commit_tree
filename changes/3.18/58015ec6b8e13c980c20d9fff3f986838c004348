arm64/efi: efistub: don't abort if base of DRAM is occupied

If we cannot relocate the kernel Image to its preferred offset of base of DRAM
plus TEXT_OFFSET, instead relocate it to the lowest available 2 MB boundary plus
TEXT_OFFSET. We may lose a bit of memory at the low end, but we can still
proceed normally otherwise.
