net: Clarification of CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY

This patch:
 - Clarifies the specific requirements of devices returning
   CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY (comments in skbuff.h).
 - Adds csum_level field to skbuff. This is used to express how
   many checksums are covered by CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY (stores n - 1).
   This replaces the overloading of skb->encapsulation, that field is
   is now only used to indicate inner headers are valid.
 - Change __skb_checksum_validate_needed to "consume" each checksum
   as indicated by csum_level as layers of the the packet are parsed.
 - Remove skb_pop_rcv_encapsulation, no longer needed in the new
   csum_level model.
