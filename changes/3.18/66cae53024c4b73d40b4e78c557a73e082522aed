[media] media: fix au0828 dvb suspend/resume to call dvb_frontend_suspend/resume

au0828 doesn't resume correctly and TV tuning fails with
xc_set_signal_source(0) failed message. Change au0828 dvb
suspend and resume interfaces to suspend and resume frontend
during suspend and resume respectively. dvb_frontend_suspend()
suspends tuner and fe using tuner and fe ops. dvb_frontend_resume()
resumes fe and tuner using fe and tuner ops ini before waking up
the frontend. With this change HVR950Q suspend and resume work
when system gets suspended when digital function is tuned to a
channel and with active TV stream, and after resume it went right
back to active TV stream.
