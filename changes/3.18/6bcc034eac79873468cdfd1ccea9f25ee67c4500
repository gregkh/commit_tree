nfsd: protect lease-related nfs4_file fields with fi_lock

Currently these fields are protected with the state_lock, but that
doesn't really make a lot of sense. These fields are "private" to the
nfs4_file, and can be protected with the more granular fi_lock.

The fi_lock is already held when setting these fields. Make the code
hold the fp->fi_lock when clearing the lease-related fields in the
nfs4_file, and no longer require that the state_lock be held when
calling into this function.

To prevent lock inversion with the i_lock, we also move the vfs_setlease
and fput calls outside of the fi_lock. This also sets us up for allowing
vfs_setlease calls to block in the future.

Finally, remove a redundant NULL pointer check. unhash_delegation_locked
locks the fp->fi_lock prior to that check, so fp in that function must
never be NULL.
