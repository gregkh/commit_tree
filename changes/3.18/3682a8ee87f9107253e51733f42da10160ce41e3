charger: max14577: Add support for MAX77836 charger

Add support for MAX77836 charger to the max14577 driver. The MAX77836
charger is almost the same as 14577 model except:
 - No dead-battery detection;
 - Support for special charger (like in MAX77693);
 - Support for DX over-voltage protection (like in MAX77693);
 - Lower values of charging current (two times lower current for
   slow/fast charge, much lower EOC current);
 - Slightly different values in ChgTyp field of STATUS2 register. On
   MAX14577 0x6 is reserved and 0x7 dead battery. On the MAX77836 the
   0x6 means special charger and 0x7 is reserved. Regardless of these
   differences the driver maps them to one enum max14577_muic_charger_type.
