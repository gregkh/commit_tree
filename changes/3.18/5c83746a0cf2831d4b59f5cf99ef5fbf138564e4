pnfs/blocklayout: in-kernel GETDEVICEINFO XDR parsing

This patches moves parsing of the GETDEVICEINFO XDR to kernel space, as well
as the management of complex devices.  The reason for that is we might have
multiple outstanding complex devices after a NOTIFY_DEVICEID4_CHANGE, which
device mapper or md can't handle as they claim devices exclusively.

But as is turns out simple striping / concatenation is fairly trivial to
implement anyway, so we make our life simpler by reducing the reliance
on blkmapd.  For now we still use blkmapd by feeding it synthetic SIMPLE
device XDR to translate device signatures to device numbers, but in the
long runs I have plans to eliminate it entirely.
