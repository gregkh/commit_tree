ALSA: pcm: Zero-clear reserved fields of PCM status ioctl in compat mode

In compat mode, we copy each field of snd_pcm_status struct but don't
touch the reserved fields, and this leaves uninitialized values
there.  Meanwhile the native ioctl does zero-clear the whole
structure, so we should follow the same rule in compat mode, too.
