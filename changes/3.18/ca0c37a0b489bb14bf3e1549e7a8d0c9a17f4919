regulator: max77693: Fix use of uninitialized regulator config

Driver allocated on stack struct regulator_config but didn't initialize
it fully. Few fields (driver_data, ena_gpio) were left untouched. This
lead to using random ena_gpio values as GPIOs for max77693 regulators.

On occasion these values could match real GPIO numbers leading to
interfering with other drivers and to unsuccessful enable/disable of
regulator.
