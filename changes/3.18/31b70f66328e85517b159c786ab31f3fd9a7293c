ima: move keyring initialization to ima_init()

ima_init() is used as a single place for all initializations.
Experimental keyring patches used the 'late_initcall' which was
co-located with the late_initcall(init_ima). When the late_initcall
for the keyring initialization was abandoned, initialization moved
to init_ima, though it would be more logical to move it to ima_init,
where the rest of the initialization is done. This patch moves the
keyring initialization to ima_init() as a preparatory step for
loading the keys which will be added to ima_init() in following
patches.
