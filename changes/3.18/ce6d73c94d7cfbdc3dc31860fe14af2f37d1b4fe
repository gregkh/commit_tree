powerpc: make of_device_ids const

of_device_ids (i.e. compatible strings and the respective data) are not
supposed to change at runtime. All functions working with of_device_ids
provided by <linux/of.h> work with const of_device_ids. This allows to
mark all struct of_device_id const, too.

While touching these line also put the __init annotation at the right
position where necessary.
