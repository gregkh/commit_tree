sparc64: Kill unnecessary tables and increase MAX_BANKS.

swapper_low_pmd_dir and swapper_pud_dir are actually completely
useless and unnecessary.

We just need swapper_pg_dir[].  Naturally the other page table chunks
will be allocated on an as-needed basis.  Since the kernel actually
accesses these tables in the PAGE_OFFSET view, there is not even a TLB
locality advantage of placing them in the kernel image.

Use the hard coded vmlinux.ld.S slot for swapper_pg_dir which is
naturally page aligned.

Increase MAX_BANKS to 1024 in order to handle heavily fragmented
virtual guests.

Even with this MAX_BANKS increase, the kernel is 20K+ smaller.
