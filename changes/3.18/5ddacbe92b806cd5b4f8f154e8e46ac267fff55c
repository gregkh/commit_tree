mm: free compound page with correct order

Compound page should be freed by put_page() or free_pages() with correct
order.  Not doing so will cause tail pages leaked.

The compound order can be obtained by compound_order() or use
HPAGE_PMD_ORDER in our case.  Some people would argue the latter is
faster but I prefer the former which is more general.

This bug was observed not just on our servers (the worst case we saw is
11G leaked on a 48G machine) but also on our workstations running Ubuntu
based distro.

  $ cat /proc/vmstat  | grep thp_zero_page_alloc
  thp_zero_page_alloc 55
  thp_zero_page_alloc_failed 0

This means there is (thp_zero_page_alloc - 1) * (2M - 4K) memory leaked.
