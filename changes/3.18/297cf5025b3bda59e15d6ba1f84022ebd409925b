powerpc: some changes in numa_setup_cpu()

this patches changes some error handling logics in numa_setup_cpu(),
when cpu node is not found, so:

if the cpu is possible, but not present, -1 is kept in numa_cpu_lookup_table,
so later, if the cpu is added, we could set correct numa information for it.

if the cpu is present, then we set the first online node to
numa_cpu_lookup_table instead of 0 ( in case 0 might not be an online node? )
