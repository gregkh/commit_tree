[media] vmalloc_sg: off by one in error handling

The "i--" needs to happen at the start of the loop or it will try to
release something bogus (probably it will crash) and it won't release
the first ->vaddr_page[].

Fixes: 7b4eeed174b7 ('[media] vmalloc_sg: make sure all pages in vmalloc area are really DMA-ready')
