cxl: Fix afu_read() not doing finish_wait() on signal or non-blocking

If afu_read() returned due to a signal or the AFU file descriptor being
opened non-blocking it would not call finish_wait() before returning,
which could lead to a crash later when something else wakes up the wait
queue.

This patch restructures the wait logic to ensure that the cleanup is
done correctly.
