powerpc/eeh: Block PCI config access upon frozen PE

The problem was found when I tried to inject PCI config error by
PHB3 PAPR error injection registers into Broadcom Austin 4-ports
NIC adapter. The frozen PE was reported successfully and EEH core
started to recover it. However, I run into fenced PHB when dumping
PCI config space as EEH logs. I was told that PCI config requests
should not be progagated to the adapter until PE reset is done
successfully. Otherise, we would run out of PHB internal credits
and trigger PCT (PCIE Completion Timeout), which leads to the
fenced PHB.

The patch introduces another PE flag EEH_PE_CFG_RESTRICTED, which
is set during PE initialization time if the PE includes the specific
PCI devices that need block PCI config access until PE reset is done.
When the PE becomes frozen for the first time, EEH_PE_CFG_BLOCKED is
set if the PE has flag EEH_PE_CFG_RESTRICTED. Then the PCI config
access to the PE will be dropped by platform PCI accessors until
PE reset is done successfully. The mechanism is shared by PowerNV
platform owned PE or userland owned ones. It's not used on pSeries
platform yet.
