storage: Add quirk for another SCM-based USB-SCSI converter

There is apparently another SCM USB-SCSI converter with ID 04E6:000F. It
is listed along with 04E6:000B in the Windows INF file for the Startech
ICUSBSCSI2 as "eUSB SCSI Adapter (Bus Powered)". The quirk allows
devices with SCSI ID other than 0 to be accessed.

Also make a couple of existing SCM product IDs lower case to be
consistent with other entries.
