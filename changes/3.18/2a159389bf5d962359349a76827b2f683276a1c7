USB: core: add device-qualifier quirk

Add new quirk for devices that cannot handle requests for the
device_qualifier descriptor.

A USB-2.0 compliant device must respond to requests for the
device_qualifier descriptor (even if it's with a request error), but at
least one device is known to misbehave after such a request.
