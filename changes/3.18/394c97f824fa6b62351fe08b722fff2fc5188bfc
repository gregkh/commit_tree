ALSA: hda/realtek - Change EAPD to verb control

This will fix no sound in Linux system after reboot from windows.

Change log:
- alc662_fill_coef() is replaced with alc_fill_eapd_coef_idx()
  and move into alc_auto_init_amp().
- For ALC262, ALC267, ALC268, ALC269, ALC233, ALC255, ALC280, ALC282,
  ALC283, ALC284, ALC285, ALC286, ALC288, ALC290, ALC292, ALC293, ALC294,
  ALC668, ALC888VC, ALC888VD, ALC891, ALC892, ALC898 and ALC1150, add update
  COEF control for EAPD setting.
- Remove alc269_fill_coef() for update EAPD control line.

ADDITIONAL NOTE:
Many Realtek cdoecs have a COEF bit to switch the master amp control
between COEF and EAPD.  Windows drivers seem using COEF while we use
EAPD, which is more standard.  As a result, some system suffer from
the silent output when booting after Windows.  This patch sets the
COEF bits on the relevant codecs properly to switch to EAPD control.
