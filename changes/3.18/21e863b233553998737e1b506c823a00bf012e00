power: bq2415x_charger: Fix memory leak on DTS parsing error

Memory allocated for 'name' was leaking if required binding properties
were not present.

The memory for 'name' was allocated early at probe with kasprintf(). It
was freed in error paths executed before and after parsing DTS but not
in that error path.

Fix the error path for parsing device tree properties.
