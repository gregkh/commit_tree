Bluetooth: Remove unnecessary l2cap_chan_unlock before l2cap_chan_add

The l2cap_chan_add() function doesn't require the channel to be
unlocked. It only requires the l2cap_conn to be unlocked. Therefore,
it's unnecessary to unlock a channel before calling l2cap_chan_add().
This patch removes such unnecessary unlocking from the
l2cap_chan_connect() function.
