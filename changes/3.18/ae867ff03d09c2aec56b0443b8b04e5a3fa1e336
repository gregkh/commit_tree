rcutorture: Specify MAXSMP=y for TREE01

Setting CONFIG_MAXSMP=y causes cpumasks to be moved offstack, which
introduces the possibility of NULL cpumask_var_t pointers.  This commit
therefore enables CONFIG_MAXSMP=y in TREE01 to increase test coverage.
However, because CONFIG_MAXSMP=y implies 8192 CPUs, we need to use
the maxcpus= boot parameter to limit the number of CPUs to something
reasonable, which in turn requires updating the scripts to handle this.
