ufs: Add regulator enable support

UFS devices are powered by at most three external power supplies -
- VCC - The flash memory core power supply, 2.7V to 3.6V or 1.70V to 1.95V
- VCCQ - The controller and I/O power supply, 1.1V to 1.3V
- VCCQ2 - Secondary controller and/or I/O power supply, 1.65V to 1.95V

For some devices VCCQ or VCCQ2 are optional as they can be
generated using internal LDO inside the UFS device.

Add DT bindings for voltage regulators that can be controlled
from host driver.
