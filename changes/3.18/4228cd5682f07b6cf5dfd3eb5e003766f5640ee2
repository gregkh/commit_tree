[media] disable COMPILE_TEST for omap1_camera

This driver depends on a legacy OMAP DMA API. So, it won't
compile-test on other archs.

While we might add stubs to the functions, this is not a
good idea, as the hole API should be replaced.

So, for now, let's just remove COMPILE_TEST and wait for
some time for people to fix. If not fixed, then we'll end
by removing this driver as a hole.
