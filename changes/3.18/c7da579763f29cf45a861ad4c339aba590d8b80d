Bluetooth: Add retransmission effort into SCO parameter table

It is expected that new parameter combinations will have the
retransmission effort value different between some entries (mainly
because of the new S4 configuration added by HFP 1.7), so it makes sense
to move it into the table instead of having it hard coded based on the
selected SCO_AIRMODE_*.
