Bluetooth: Improve data packing in SAR mode

There is no need to decrease pdu size with L2CAP SDU lenght in Start
L2CAP SDU frame. Start packtet is just 2 bytes longer as specified and
we can keep payload as long as possible.

When testing SAR L2CAP against PTS, L2CAP channel is usually configured
in that way, that SDU = MPS * 3. PTS expets then 3 I-Frames from IUT: Start,
Continuation and End frame.

Without this fix, we sent 4 I-Frames. We could pass a test by using -b
option in l2test and send just two bytes less than SDU length. With this
patch no need to use -b option.
