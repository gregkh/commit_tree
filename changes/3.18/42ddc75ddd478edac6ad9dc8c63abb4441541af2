locktorture: Support mutexes

Add a "mutex_lock" torture test. The main difference with the already
existing spinlock tests is that the latency of the critical region
is much larger. We randomly delay for (arbitrarily) either 500 ms or,
otherwise, 25 ms. While this can considerably reduce the amount of
writes compared to non blocking locks, if run long enough it can have
the same torturous effect. Furthermore it is more representative of
mutex hold times and can stress better things like thrashing.
