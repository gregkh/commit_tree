nfsd: set and test NFSD4_CLIENT_STABLE bit to reduce nfsdcltrack upcalls

The nfsdcltrack upcall doesn't utilize the NFSD4_CLIENT_STABLE flag,
which basically results in an upcall every time we call into the client
tracking ops.

Change it to set this bit on a successful "check" or "create" request,
and clear it on a "remove" request.  Also, check to see if that bit is
set before upcalling on a "check" or "remove" request, and skip
upcalling appropriately, depending on its state.
