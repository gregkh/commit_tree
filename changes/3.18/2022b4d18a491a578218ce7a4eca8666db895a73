mm: fix swapoff hang after page migration and fork

I've been seeing swapoff hangs in recent testing: it's cycling around
trying unsuccessfully to find an mm for some remaining pages of swap.

I have been exercising swap and page migration more heavily recently,
and now notice a long-standing error in copy_one_pte(): it's trying to
add dst_mm to swapoff's mmlist when it finds a swap entry, but is doing
so even when it's a migration entry or an hwpoison entry.

Which wouldn't matter much, except it adds dst_mm next to src_mm,
assuming src_mm is already on the mmlist: which may not be so.  Then if
pages are later swapped out from dst_mm, swapoff won't be able to find
where to replace them.

There's already a !non_swap_entry() test for stats: move that up before
the swap_duplicate() and the addition to mmlist.
