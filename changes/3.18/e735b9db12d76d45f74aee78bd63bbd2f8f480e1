perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Haswell-EP uncore support

The uncore subsystem in Haswell-EP is similar to Sandy/Ivy
Bridge-EP. There are some differences in config register
encoding and pci device IDs. The Haswell-EP uncore also
supports a few new events. Add the Haswell-EP driver to
the snbep split driver.
