KEYS: Remove key_type::match in favour of overriding default by match_preparse

A previous patch added a ->match_preparse() method to the key type.  This is
allowed to override the function called by the iteration algorithm.
Therefore, we can just set a default that simply checks for an exact match of
the key description with the original criterion data and allow match_preparse
to override it as needed.

The key_type::match op is then redundant and can be removed, as can the
user_match() function.
