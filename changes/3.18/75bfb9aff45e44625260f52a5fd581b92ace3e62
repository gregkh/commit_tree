Btrfs: cleanup error handling in build_backref_tree

When balance panics it tends to panic in the

BUG_ON(!upper->checked);

test, because it means it couldn't build the backref tree properly.  This is
annoying to users and frankly a recoverable error, nothing in this function is
actually fatal since it is just an in-memory building of the backrefs for a
given bytenr.  So go through and change all the BUG_ON()'s to ASSERT()'s, and
fix the BUG_ON(!upper->checked) thing to just return an error.

This patch also fixes the error handling so it tears down the work we've done
properly.  This code was horribly broken since we always just panic'ed instead
of actually erroring out, so it needed to be completely re-worked.  With this
patch my broken image no longer panics when I mount it.  Thanks,
