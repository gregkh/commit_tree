staging/lustre/llite: Fix integer overflow in ll_fid2path

Reported by Dan Carpenter <dan.carpenter@oracle.com>

outsize = sizeof(*gfout) + gfin->gf_pathlen;

Where outsize is int and gf_pathlen is u32 from userspace
can lead to integer overflowwhere outsize is some small number
less than sizeof(*gfout)

Add a check for pathlen to be of sensical size.
