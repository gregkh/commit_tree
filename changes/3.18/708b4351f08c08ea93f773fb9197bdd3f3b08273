ASoC: fsl: Add Freescale Generic ASoC Sound Card with ASRC support

The Freescale Generic ASoC Sound Card is a general ASoC DAI Link driver that
can be used, ideally, for all Freescale CPU DAI drivers and external CODECs.

The idea of this generic sound card is a bit like ASoC Simple Card. However,
for Freescale SoCs (especially those released in recent years), most of them
have ASRC (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/fsl,asrc.txt) inside. And
this is a specific feature that might be painstakingly controlled and merged
into the Simple Card driver.

So having this driver will allow all Freescale SoC users to benefit from the
simplification to support a new card and the capability of wide sample rates
support through ASRC.

The driver is initially designed for sound card using I2S or PCM DAI formats.
However, it's also possible to merge those non-I2S/PCM type sound cards, such
as S/PDIF audio and HDMI audio, into this card as long as the merge will not
break the original function and as long as there is something redundant that
can be abstracted along with I2S type sound cards.

As an initial version, it only supports three cards that I can test:
imx-audio-cs42888, a new card that links ESAI with CS42888 CODEC
imx-audio-sgtl5000, just like the old imx-sgtl5000.c driver
imx-audio-wm8962, just like the old imx-wm8962.c driver

The driver is also compatible with the old Device Tree bindings of WM8962 and
SGTL5000. So we may consider to remove those two drivers after this driver is
totally enabled. (It needs to be added into defconfig)
