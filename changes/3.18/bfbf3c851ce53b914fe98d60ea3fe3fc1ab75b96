drm: move drm_mmap to <drm/drm_legacy.h>

Now that we've removed the copypasted users in gem/ttm we can
relegate the legacy buffer mapping support to where it belongs.
Also give it the proper drm_legacy_ prefix.

While at it statify drm_mmap_locked, somehow I've missed that in my
previous header rework.
