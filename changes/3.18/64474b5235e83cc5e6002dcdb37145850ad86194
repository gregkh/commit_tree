x86/PCI: Move __init annotation to the correct place

According to include/linux/init.h, the __init annotation should be added
immediately before the function name.  However, for quite a few functions
in mmconfig-shared.c this is not the case.  It's either before the return
type or even in the middle of it.  Beside gcc still getting it right, we
should change them to comply to the rules of include/linux/init.h.
