net: sched: cls_cgroup use RCU

Make cgroup classifier safe for RCU.

Also drops the calls in the classify routine that were doing a
rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock(). If the rcu_read_lock() isn't held
entering this routine we have issues with deleting the classifier
chain so remove the unnecessary rcu_read_lock()/rcu_read_unlock()
pair noting all paths AFAIK hold rcu_read_lock.

If there is a case where classify is called without the rcu read lock
then an rcu splat will occur and we can correct it.
