mm: clean up zone flags

Page reclaim tests zone_is_reclaim_dirty(), but the site that actually
sets this state does zone_set_flag(zone, ZONE_TAIL_LRU_DIRTY), sending the
reader through layers indirection just to track down a simple bit.

Remove all zone flag wrappers and just use bitops against zone->flags
directly.  It's just as readable and the lines are barely any longer.

Also rename ZONE_TAIL_LRU_DIRTY to ZONE_DIRTY to match ZONE_WRITEBACK, and
remove the zone_flags_t typedef.
