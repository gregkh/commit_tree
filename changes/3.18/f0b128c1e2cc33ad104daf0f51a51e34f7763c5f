openvswitch: Wrap struct ovs_key_ipv4_tunnel in a new structure.

Currently, the flow information that is matched for tunnels and
the tunnel data passed around with packets is the same. However,
as additional information is added this is not necessarily desirable,
as in the case of pointers.

This adds a new structure for tunnel metadata which currently contains
only the existing struct. This change is purely internal to the kernel
since the current OVS_KEY_ATTR_IPV4_TUNNEL is simply a compressed version
of OVS_KEY_ATTR_TUNNEL that is translated at flow setup.
