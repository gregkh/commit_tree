Revert "usb: gadget: composite: dequeue cdev->req before free its buffer"

This reverts commit be0a8887bb931af0e21531da20c41533effbb0d6.

The original commit f2267089ea17fa97b796b1b4247e3f8957655df3
(usb: gadget: composite: dequeue cdev->req before free it in
composite_dev_cleanup) ended up being reverted because it caused
more issues then fixed. We will also revert this counter part
commit so we start clean to properly add that idea back.
