block: introduce blk_flush_queue to drive flush machinery

This patch introduces 'struct blk_flush_queue' and puts all
flush machinery related fields into this structure, so that

	- flush implementation details aren't exposed to driver
	- it is easy to convert to per dispatch-queue flush machinery

This patch is basically a mechanical replacement.
