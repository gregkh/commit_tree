HID: uhid: avoid dangling pointers in uhid context

Avoid keeping uhid->rd_data and uhid->rd_size set in case
uhid_dev_create2() fails. This is non-critical as we never flip
uhid->running and thus never enter uhid_dev_destroy(). However, it's much
nicer for debugging if pointers are only set if they point to valid data.
