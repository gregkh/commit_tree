fs: make cont_expand_zero interruptible

This patch makes it possible to kill a process looping in
cont_expand_zero. A process may spend a lot of time in this function, so
it is desirable to be able to kill it.

It happened to me that I wanted to copy a piece data from the disk to a
file. By mistake, I used the "seek" parameter to dd instead of "skip". Due
to the "seek" parameter, dd attempted to extend the file and became stuck
doing so - the only possibility was to reset the machine or wait many
hours until the filesystem runs out of space and cont_expand_zero fails.
We need this patch to be able to terminate the process.
