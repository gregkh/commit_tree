arm/arm64: KVM: Support KVM_CAP_READONLY_MEM

When userspace loads code and data in a read-only memory regions, KVM
needs to be able to handle this on arm and arm64.  Specifically this is
used when running code directly from a read-only flash device; the
common scenario is a UEFI blob loaded with the -bios option in QEMU.

Note that the MMIO exit on writes to a read-only memory is ABI and can
be used to emulate block-erase style flash devices.
