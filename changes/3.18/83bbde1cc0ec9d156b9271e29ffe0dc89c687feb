of/pci: Move of_pci_range_to_resource() to of/address.c

We need to enhance of_pci_range_to_resources() enough that it won't make
sense for it to be inline anymore.  Move it to drivers/of/address.c, under
#ifdef CONFIG_PCI.

of_address.h previously implemented of_pci_range_to_resources()
unconditionally, regardless of any config options.  The implementation in
address.c is defined only when CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS=y and CONFIG_PCI=y,
so add a dummy version to avoid build errors when CONFIG_OF or
CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS is not defined.

[bhelgaas: drop extra detail from changelog, move def under CONFIG_PCI,
add dummy of_pci_range_to_resource() for build errors (from Arnd)]
