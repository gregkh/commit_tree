powerpc/eeh: Rename flag EEH_PE_RESET to EEH_PE_CFG_BLOCKED

The flag EEH_PE_RESET indicates blocking config space of the PE
during reset time. We potentially need block PE's config space
other than reset time. So it's reasonable to replace it with
EEH_PE_CFG_BLOCKED to indicate its usage.

There are no substantial code or logic changes in this patch.
