PM / devfreq: Remove ARCH_HAS_OPP completely

The Kconfig symbol ARCH_HAS_OPP became redundant in v3.16: commit
049d595a4db3 ("PM / OPP: Make OPP invisible to users in Kconfig")
removed the only dependency that used it. Setting it had no effect
anymore.

So commit 78c5e0bb145d ("PM / OPP: Remove ARCH_HAS_OPP") removed it. For
some reason that commit did not remove all select statements for that
symbol. These statements are now useless. Remove one from devfreq too.
