Revert "percpu: free percpu allocation info for uniprocessor system"

This reverts commit 3189eddbcafc ("percpu: free percpu allocation info for
uniprocessor system").

The commit causes a hang with a crisv32 image. This may be an architecture
problem, but at least for now the revert is necessary to be able to boot a
crisv32 image.
