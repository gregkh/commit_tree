cxl: Driver code for powernv PCIe based cards for userspace access

This is the core of the cxl driver.

It adds support for using cxl cards in the powernv environment only (ie POWER8
bare metal). It allows access to cxl accelerators by userspace using the
/dev/cxl/afuM.N char devices.

The kernel driver has no knowledge of the function implemented by the
accelerator. It provides services to userspace via the /dev/cxl/afuM.N
devices. When a program opens this device and runs the start work IOCTL, the
accelerator will have coherent access to that processes memory using the same
virtual addresses. That process may mmap the device to access any MMIO space
the accelerator provides.  Also, reads on the device will allow interrupts to
be received. These services are further documented in a later patch in
Documentation/powerpc/cxl.txt.

Documentation of the cxl hardware architecture and userspace API is provided in
subsequent patches.
