x86/xen: delay construction of mfn_list_list

The 3 level p2m tree for the Xen tools is constructed very early at
boot by calling xen_build_mfn_list_list(). Memory needed for this tree
is allocated via extend_brk().

As this tree (other than the kernel internal p2m tree) is only needed
for domain save/restore, live migration and crash dump analysis it
doesn't matter whether it is constructed very early or just some
milliseconds later when memory allocation is possible by other means.

This patch moves the call of xen_build_mfn_list_list() just after
calling xen_pagetable_p2m_copy() simplifying this function, too, as it
doesn't have to bother with two parallel trees now. The same applies
for some other internal functions.

While simplifying code, make early_can_reuse_p2m_middle() static and
drop the unused second parameter. p2m_mid_identity_mfn can be removed
as well, it isn't used either.
