drm/i915: Init some CHV workarounds via LRIs in ring->init_context()

Follow the BDW example and apply the workarounds touching registers
which are saved in the context image through LRIs in the new
ring->init_context() hook.

This makes Mesa much happier and eg. glxgears doesn't hang after
the first frame.
