mfd: ti_am335x_tscadc: Fix TSC operation after ADC continouous mode

After enabling and disabling ADC continuous mode via sysfs, ts_print_raw
fails to return any data. This is because when ADC is configured for
continuous mode, it disables touch screen steps.These steps are not
re-enabled when ADC continuous mode is disabled. Therefore existing values
of REG_SE needs to be cached before enabling continuous mode and
disabling touch screen steps and enabling ADC steps. The cached value
are to be restored to REG_SE once ADC is disabled.
