x86/mce: Avoid showing repetitive message from intel_init_thermal()

intel_init_thermal() is called from a) at the time of system initializing
and b) at the time of system resume to initialize thermal
monitoring.

In case when thermal monitoring is handled by SMI, we get to know it via
printk(). Currently it gives the message at both cases, but its okay if
we get it only once and no need to get the same message at every time
system resumes.

So, limit showing this message only at system boot time by avoid showing
at system resume and reduce abusing kernel log buffer.
