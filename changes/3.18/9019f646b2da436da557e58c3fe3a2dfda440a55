ath9k: Fix RX filter calculation

If multiple channel contexts are active, then the opmode
can be different in each context. Since the RX filter is
calculated in ath_startrecv() before switching to the
new opmode, the wrong filters are chosen.

Fix this by calling ath9k_calculate_summary_state() before
the RX module is started.
