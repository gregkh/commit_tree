arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Fix error code in kvm_vgic_create()

If we detect another vCPU is running we just exit and return 0 as if we
succesfully created the VGIC, but the VGIC wouldn't actual be created.

This shouldn't break in-kernel behavior because the kernel will not
observe the failed the attempt to create the VGIC, but userspace could
be rightfully confused.
