Btrfs: try not to ENOSPC on log replay

When doing log replay we may have to update inodes, which traditionally goes
through our delayed inode stuff.  This will try to move space over from the
trans handle, but we don't reserve space in our trans handle on replay since we
don't know how much we will need, so instead we try to flush.  But because we
have a trans handle open we won't flush anything, so if we are out of reserve
space we will simply return ENOSPC.  Since we know that if an operation made it
into the log then we definitely had space before the box bought the farm then we
don't need to worry about doing this space reservation.  Use the
fs_info->log_root_recovering flag to skip the delayed inode stuff and update the
item directly.  Thanks,
