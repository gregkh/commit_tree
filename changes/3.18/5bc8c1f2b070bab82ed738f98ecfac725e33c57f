cfg80211: allow passing frame type to cfg80211_inform_bss()

When using the cfg80211_inform_bss[_width]() functions drivers
cannot currently indicate whether the data was received in a
beacon or probe response. Fix that by passing a new enum that
indicates such (or unknown).

For good measure, use it in ath6kl.
