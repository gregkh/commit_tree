PM / Domains: Rename cpu_data to cpuidle_data

The "cpu_data" are defined for some archs and thus conflicting with the
"cpu_data" member in the struct gpd_cpu_data. This causes a compiler
error for those archs.

Let's fix it by rename the member to cpuidle_data. In this context it
also seems appropriate to rename the struct to gpd_cpuidle_data to
better reflect its use.
