net: mv643xx_eth: reclaim TX skbs only when released by the HW

ATM, txq_reclaim will dequeue and free an skb for each tx desc released
by the hw that has TX_LAST_DESC set. However, in case of TSO, each
hw desc embedding the last part of a segment has TX_LAST_DESC set,
losing the one-to-one 'last skb frag'/'TX_LAST_DESC set' correspondance,
which causes data corruption.

Fix this by checking TX_ENABLE_INTERRUPT instead of TX_LAST_DESC, and
warn when trying to dequeue from an empty txq (which can be symptomatic
of releasing skbs prematurely).
