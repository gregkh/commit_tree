fs, jbd: use a more generic hash function

While the hash function used by the revoke hashtable is good somewhere else,
it's not really good here.

The default hash shift (8) means that one third of the hashing function
gets lost (and is undefined anyways (8 - 12 = negative shift)):

	"(block << (hash_shift - 12))) & (table->hash_size - 1)"

Instead, just use the kernel's generic hash function that gets used everywhere
else.
