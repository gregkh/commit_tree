openvswitch: Factor out allocation and verification of actions.

As the size of the flow key grows, it can put some pressure on the
stack. This is particularly true in ovs_flow_cmd_set(), which needs several
copies of the key on the stack. One of those uses is logically separate,
so this factors it out to reduce stack pressure and improve readibility.
