Revert "arm: pxa: Transition pxa27x to clk framework"

This reverts commit 9ff25d7b58d8a4374886843ed3ed21f1ef17bf16.

Originally reported on the kernel-build-reports mailing list[0]. The
problem is caused by kernel configs that select both pxa25x and pxa27x
such as cm_x2xx_defconfig and palmz72_defconfig. The short term solution
is to revert the patch introducing the failure. Longer term, all the PXA
chips will be converted to the common clock framework allowing support
for various PXA chips to build into a single image.

Reverting just this one patch does introduce some dead code into the
kernel, but that is offset by making it easier to convert the remaining
PXA platforms to the clock framework.
