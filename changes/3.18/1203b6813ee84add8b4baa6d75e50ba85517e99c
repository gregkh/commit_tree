Btrfs: modify clean_io_failure and make it suit direct io

We could not use clean_io_failure in the direct IO path because it got the
filesystem information from the page structure, but the page in the direct
IO bio didn't have the filesystem information in its structure. So we need
modify it and pass all the information it need by parameters.
