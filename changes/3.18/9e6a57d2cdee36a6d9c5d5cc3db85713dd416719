um: delete unnecessary bootmem struct page array

1) uml kernel bootmem managed through bootmem_data->node_bootmem_map,
not the struct page array, so the array is unnecessary.

2) the bootmem struct page array has been pointed by a *local* pointer,
struct page *map, in init_maps function. The array can be accessed only
in init_maps's scope. As a result, uml kernel wastes about 1% of total
memory.
