blk-mq: fix potential hang if rolling wakeup depth is too high

We currently divide the queue depth by 4 as our batch wakeup
count, but we split the wakeups over BT_WAIT_QUEUES number of
wait queues. This defaults to 8. If the product of the resulting
batch wake count and BT_WAIT_QUEUES is higher than the device
queue depth, we can get into a situation where a task goes to
sleep waiting for a request, but never gets woken up.
