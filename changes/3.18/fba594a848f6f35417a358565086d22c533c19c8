serial: core: Remove unsafe x_char optimization

uart_unthrottle() attempts to avoid sending START and the previous
x_char if the previous x_char has not yet been sent. However, this
optimization could leave the sender in a throttled state; for example,
if the sender is throttled and this unthrottle coincides with a manual
tcflow(TCION) from user-space, then neither START would be sent.
