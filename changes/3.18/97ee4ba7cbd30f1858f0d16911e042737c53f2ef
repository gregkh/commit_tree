mm: page_alloc: Make paranoid check in move_freepages a VM_BUG_ON

Since 2.6.24 there has been a paranoid check in move_freepages that looks
up the zone of two pages.  This is a very slow path and the only time I've
seen this bug trigger recently is when memory initialisation was broken
during patch development.  Despite the fact it's a slow path, this patch
converts the check to a VM_BUG_ON anyway as it has served its purpose by
now.
