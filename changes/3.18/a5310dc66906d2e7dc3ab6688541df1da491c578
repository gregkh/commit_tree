Staging: rtl8192e: rtl8192e: Merges two lines of code and removes unused variable

This patch merges an assignment with an immediately following return of
the assigned variable. It also removes a variable that becomes unused due to this transformation.
The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used to make this transformation:

@@
expression ret;
identifier f;
@@

-ret =
+return
     f(...);
-return ret;

@@
identifier ret;
type t;
identifier c;
@@

-t ret = c;
 ... when != ret
     when strict
