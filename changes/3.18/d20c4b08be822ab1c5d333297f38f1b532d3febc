dm raid: fix inaccessible superblocks causing oops in configure_discard_support

Commit 48cf06bc5f ("dm raid: add discard support for RAID levels 4, 5
and 6") did not properly handle missing metadata device(s).  A failing
read of the superblock causes the metadata and data devices to be
removed from the dev array in struct raid_set, setting references to
both devices to NULL.  configure_discard_support() nonetheless tries to
access the data dev unconditionally causing an oops.
