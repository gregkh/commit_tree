drm/i915/bdw: Don't execute context reset and switch with Execlists

These two functions make no sense in an Logical Ring Context & Execlists
world.

v2: We got rid of lrc_enabled and centralized everything in the sanitized
i915.enable_execlists instead.

v3: Rebased.  Corrected a typo in comment for i915_switch_context and
added a comment that it should not be called in execlist mode. Added
WARN_ON if i915_switch_context is called in execlist mode. Moved check
for execlist mode out of i915_switch_context and into callers. Added
comment in context_reset explaining why nothing is done in execlist
mode.
