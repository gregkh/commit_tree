staging: et131x: Simplify unlocking tcb_send_qlock in et131x_tx_timeout()

The tcb_send_qlock spinlock is unlocked in all three paths at the end of
et131x_tx_timeout(). We can call it once before entering any of the paths,
saving ourselves a few lines of code.

This change puts tcb->count++ outside of the lock, but et131x_tx_timeout()
itself is protected by the tx_global_lock, so this shouldn't matter.
