KVM: device: add simple registration mechanism for kvm_device_ops

kvm_ioctl_create_device currently has knowledge of all the device types
and their associated ops. This is fairly inflexible when adding support
for new in-kernel device emulations, so move what we currently have out
into a table, which can support dynamic registration of ops by new
drivers for virtual hardware.
