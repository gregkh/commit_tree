nfs41: change PNFS_LAYOUTRET_ON_SETATTR to only return on truncation to smaller size

Both blocks layout and objects layout want to use it to avoid CB_LAYOUTRECALL
but that should only happen if client is doing truncation to a smaller size.
For other cases, we let server decide if it wants to recall client's layouts.
Change PNFS_LAYOUTRET_ON_SETATTR to follow the logic and not to send
layoutreturn unnecessarily.
