locktorture: Support rwlocks

Add a "rw_lock" torture test to stress kernel rwlocks and their irq
variant. Reader critical regions are 5x longer than writers. As such
a similar ratio of lock acquisitions is seen in the statistics. In the
case of massive contention, both hold the lock for 1/10 of a second.
