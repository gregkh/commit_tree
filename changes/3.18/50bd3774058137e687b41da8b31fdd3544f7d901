md: avoid potential long delay under pers_lock

printk may cause long time lapse if value of printk_delay in sysctl is
configured large by user. If register_md_personality takes long time to print in
spinlock pers_lock, we may encounter high CPU usage rate when there are other
pers_lock competitors who may be blocked to spin.
We can avoid this condition by moving printk out of coverage of pers_lock
spinlock.
