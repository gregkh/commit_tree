staging: comedi: (regression) channel list must be set for COMEDI_CMD ioctl

`do_cmd_ioctl()`, the handler for the `COMEDI_CMD` ioctl can incorrectly
call the Comedi subdevice's `do_cmd()` handler with a NULL channel list
pointer.  This is a regression as the `do_cmd()` handler has never been
expected to deal with that, leading to a kernel OOPS when it tries to
dereference it.

A NULL channel list pointer is allowed for the `COMEDI_CMDTEST` ioctl,
handled by `do_cmdtest_ioctl()` and the subdevice's `do_cmdtest()`
handler, but not for the `COMEDI_CMD` ioctl and its handlers.

Both `do_cmd_ioctl()` and `do_cmdtest_ioctl()` call
`__comedi_get_user_chanlist()` to copy the channel list from user memory
into dynamically allocated kernel memory and check it for consistency.
That function currently returns 0 if the `user_chanlist` parameter
(pointing to the channel list in user memory) is NULL.  That's fine for
`do_cmdtest_ioctl()`, but `do_cmd_ioctl()` incorrectly assumes the
kernel copy of the channel list has been set-up correctly.

Fix it by not allowing the `user_chanlist` parameter to be NULL in
`__comedi_get_user_chanlist()`, and only calling it from
`do_cmdtest_ioctl()` if the parameter is non-NULL.

Thanks to Bernd Porr for reporting the bug via an initial patch sent
privately.
