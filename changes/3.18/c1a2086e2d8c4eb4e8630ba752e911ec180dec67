of/selftest: Fix off-by-one error in removal path

The removal path for selftest data has an off by one error that causes
the code to dereference beyond the end of the nodes[] array on the first
pass through. The old code only worked by chance on a lot of platforms,
but the bug was recently exposed on aarch64.

The fix is simple. Decrement the node count before dereferencing, not
after.
