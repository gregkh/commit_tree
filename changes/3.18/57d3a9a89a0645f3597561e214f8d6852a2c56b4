mtd: nand: fix nand_lock/unlock() function

Do nand reset before write protect check.

If we want to check the WP# low or high through STATUS READ and check bit 7,
we must reset the device, other operation (eg.erase/program a locked block) can
also clear the bit 7 of status register.

As we know the status register can be refreshed, if we do some operation to trigger it,
for example if we do erase/program operation to one block that is locked, then READ STATUS,
the bit 7 of READ STATUS will be 0 indicate the device in write protect, then if we do
erase/program operation to another block that is unlocked, the bit 7 of READ STATUS will
be 1 indicate the device is not write protect.
Suppose we checked the bit 7 of READ STATUS is 0 then judge the WP# is low (write protect),
but in this case the WP# maybe high if we do erase/program operation to a locked block,
so we must reset the device if we want to check the WP# low or high through STATUS READ and
check bit 7.
