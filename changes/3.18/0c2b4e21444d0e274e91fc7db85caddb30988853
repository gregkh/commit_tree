mtd: correct upper bounds check for mtd_*() APIs

When checking the upper boundary (i.e., whether an address is higher
than the maximum size of the MTD), we should be doing an inclusive check
(greater or equal). For instance, an address of 16MB (0x1000000) on a
16MB device is invalid.

The strengthening of this bounds check is redundant for those which
already have a address+length check and ensure that the length is
non-zero, but let's just fix them all, for completeness.
