ixgbe: return integer from ixgbe_acquire_msix_vectors

Similar to how ixgbevf handles acquiring MSI-X vectors, we can return an
error code instead of relying on the flag being set. This makes it more
clear that we have failed to setup MSI-X mode, and also will make it
easier to consolidate MSI-X related code all into the single function.
