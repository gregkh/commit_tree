percpu_ref: rename things to prepare for decoupling percpu/atomic mode switch

percpu_ref will be restructured so that percpu/atomic mode switching
and reference killing are dedoupled.  In preparation, do the following
renames.

* percpu_ref->confirm_kill	-> percpu_ref->confirm_switch
* __PERCPU_REF_DEAD		-> __PERCPU_REF_ATOMIC
* __percpu_ref_alive()		-> __ref_is_percpu()

This patch is pure rename and doesn't introduce any functional
changes.
