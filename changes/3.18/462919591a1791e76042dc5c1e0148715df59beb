KEYS: Preparse match data

Preparse the match data.  This provides several advantages:

 (1) The preparser can reject invalid criteria up front.

 (2) The preparser can convert the criteria to binary data if necessary (the
     asymmetric key type really wants to do binary comparison of the key IDs).

 (3) The preparser can set the type of search to be performed.  This means
     that it's not then a one-off setting in the key type.

 (4) The preparser can set an appropriate comparator function.
