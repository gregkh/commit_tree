team: avoid race condition in scheduling delayed work

When team_notify_peers and team_mcast_rejoin are called, they both reset
their respective .count_pending atomic variable. Then when the actual
worker function is executed, the variable is atomically decremented.
This pattern introduces a potential race condition where the
.count_pending rolls over and the worker function keeps rescheduling
until .count_pending decrements to zero again:

THREAD 1                           THREAD 2

========                           ========
team_notify_peers(teamX)
  atomic_set count_pending = 1
  schedule_delayed_work
                                   team_notify_peers(teamX)
                                   atomic_set count_pending = 1
team_notify_peers_work
  atomic_dec_and_test
    count_pending = 0
  (return)
                                   schedule_delayed_work
                                   team_notify_peers_work
                                   atomic_dec_and_test
                                     count_pending = -1
                                   schedule_delayed_work
                                   (repeat until count_pending = 0)

Instead of assigning a new value to .count_pending, use atomic_add to
tack-on the additional desired worker function invocations.
