ext4: improve extents status tree trace point

This commit improves the trace point of extents status tree.  We rename
trace_ext4_es_shrink_enter in ext4_es_count() because it is also used
in ext4_es_scan() and we can not identify them from the result.

Further this commit fixes a variable name in trace point in order to
keep consistency with others.
