powerpc/eeh: Unfreeze PE on enabling EEH functionality

When passing through PE to guest, that's possibly in frozen
state. The driver for the pass-through devices on guest side
can't be loaded successfully as reported. We already had one
gate in eeh_dev_open() to clear PE frozen state accordingly,
but that's not enough because the function is only called at
QEMU startup for once.

The patch adds another gate in eeh_pe_set_option() so that the
PE frozen state can be cleared at QEMU restart time.
