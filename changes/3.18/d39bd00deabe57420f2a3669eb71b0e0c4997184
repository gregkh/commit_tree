seccomp: Allow arch code to provide seccomp_data

populate_seccomp_data is expensive: it works by inspecting
task_pt_regs and various other bits to piece together all the
information, and it's does so in multiple partially redundant steps.

Arch-specific code in the syscall entry path can do much better.

Admittedly this adds a bit of additional room for error, but the
speedup should be worth it.
