mempolicy: sanitize the usage of get_task_policy()

Cleanup + preparation. Every user of get_task_policy() calls it
unconditionally, even if it is not going to use the result.

get_task_policy() is cheap but still this does not look clean, plus
the code looks simpler if get_task_policy() is called only when this
is really needed.

Note: I hope this is correct, but it is not clear why vma_policy_mof()
doesn't fall back to get_task_policy() if ->get_policy() returns NULL.
