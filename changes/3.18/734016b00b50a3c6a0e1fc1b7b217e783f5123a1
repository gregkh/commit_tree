uas: Add no-report-opcodes quirk

Besides the ASM1051 (*) needing sdev->no_report_opcodes = 1, it turns out that
the JMicron JMS567 also needs it to work properly with uas (usb-storage always
sets it). Since some of the scsi devs were not to keen on the idea to
outrightly set sdev->no_report_opcodes = 1 for all uas devices, so add a quirk
for this, and set it for the JMS567.

*) Which has become a non-issue since we've completely blacklisted uas on
the ASM1051 for other reasons
