NFC: trf7970a: Move IRQ Status Read quirk to device tree

The quirk indicating whether the trf7970a has
the "IRQ Status Read" erratum or not is currently
implemented using the 'driver_data' member of the
'spi_device_id' structure.  That requires the
driver to be modified to turn the quirk off when
a version of the trf7970a that doesn't have the
erratum is being used.  To fix that, create a
new device tree property called
'irq-status-read-quirk' that indicates that the
trf7970a being used has the erratum.

While at it, rename 'TRF7970A_QUIRK_IRQ_STATUS_READ_ERRATA'
to 'TRF7970A_QUIRK_IRQ_STATUS_READ' to make it
less of an eyesore.
