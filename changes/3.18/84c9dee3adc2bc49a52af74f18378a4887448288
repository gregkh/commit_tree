pnfs: enable CB_NOTIFY_DEVICEID support

This code has been around for a while, but never was enabled, although
it is in a working shape.

Note that we implement NOTIFY_DEVICEID4_CHANGE identical to
NOTIFY_DEVICEID4_DELETE.  Given that in either case we can't do anything
but preventing further lookups of a given device ID there isn't much difference
in semantics for the two.  For the delete case the server MUST ensure that
there are no outstanding layouts, while for the change case it doesn't, but
that has little relevance to the client.
