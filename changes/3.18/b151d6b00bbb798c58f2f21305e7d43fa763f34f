ima: provide flag to identify new empty files

On ima_file_free(), newly created empty files are not labeled with
an initial security.ima value, because the iversion did not change.
Commit dff6efc "fs: fix iversion handling" introduced a change in
iversion behavior.  To verify this change use the shell command:

  $ (exec >foo)
  $ getfattr -h -e hex -d -m security foo

This patch defines the IMA_NEW_FILE flag.  The flag is initially
set, when IMA detects that a new file is created, and subsequently
checked on the ima_file_free() hook to set the initial security.ima
value.
