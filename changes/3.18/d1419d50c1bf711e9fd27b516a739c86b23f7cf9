mmc: rtsx_pci_sdmmc: fix incorrect last byte in R2 response

Current code erroneously fill the last byte of R2 response with an undefined
value. In addition, the controller actually 'offloads' the last byte
(CRC7, end bit) while receiving R2 response and thus it's impossible to get the
actual value. This could cause mmc stack to obtain inconsistent CID from the
same card after resume and misidentify it as a different card.

Fix by assigning dummy CRC and end bit: {7'b0, 1} = 0x1 to the last byte of R2.
