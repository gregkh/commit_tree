sched/numa: Fix off-by-one in capacity check

Commit a43455a1d572daf7b730fe12eb747d1e17411365 ensures that
task_numa_migrate will call task_numa_compare on the preferred
node all the time, even when the preferred node has no free capacity.

This could lead to a performance regression if nr_running == capacity
on both the source and the destination node. This can be avoided by
also checking for nr_running == capacity on the source node, which is
one stricter than checking .has_free_capacity.
