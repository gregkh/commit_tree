[media] enable COMPILE_TEST for media drivers

There are several arch-specific media drivers that don't
require asm-specific includes and can be successfully
compiled on x86. Add COMPILE_TEST dependency for them, in
order to allow a broader test on those drivers.

That helps static analysis tools like Coverity to discover
eventual troubles there.
