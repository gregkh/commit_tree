clk: Add a function to retrieve phase

The current phase API doesn't look into the actual hardware to get the phase
value, but will rather get it from a variable only set by the set_phase
function.

This will cause issue when the client driver will never call the set_phase
function, where we can end up having a reported phase that will not match what
the hardware has been programmed to by the bootloader or what phase is
programmed out of reset.

Add a new get_phase function for the drivers to implement so that we can get
this value.
