net:fec: add enet refrence clock for i.MX 6SX chip

i.MX6sx enet has below clocks for user config:
clk_ipg: ipg_clk_s, ipg_clk_mac0_s, 66Mhz
clk_ahb: enet system clock, it is enet AXI clock for imx6sx.
	 For imx6sx, it alos is the clock source of interrupt coalescing.
	 The clock range: 200Mhz ~ 266Mhz.
clk_ref: refrence clock for tx and rx. For imx6sx enet RGMII mode,
	 the refrence clock is 125Mhz coming from internal PLL or external.
	 In i.MX6sx-arm2 board, the clock is from internal PLL.
	 clk_ref is optional, depends on board.
clk_enet_out: The clock can be output from internal PLL. It can supply 50Mhz
	 clock for phy. clk_enet_out is optional, depends on chip and board.
clk_ptp: 1588 ts clock. It is optional, depends on chip.

The patch add clk_ref to distiguish the different clocks.
