drm: Drop grab fpriv->fbs_lock in drm_fb_release

Paulo Zanoni reported a lockdep splat with a locking inversion between
fpriv->fbs_lock and the modeset locks. This issue was introduced in

    drm: Fixup locking for universal cursor planes

This here is actually one of the rare cases where lockdep hits a false
positive: The deadlock only happens in drm_fb_release, which cleans up
the file private structure when all the references are gone. So the
locking is the very last one and no one else can deadlock. It also
doesn't protect anything at all, since all ioctls are guaranteed to
have returned at this point - otherwise they'd still hold a reference
on the file.

So let's just drop it and replace it with a big comment.
