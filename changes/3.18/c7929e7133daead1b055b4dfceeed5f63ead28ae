staging: comedi: amplc_pci224: remove options to select output ranges

When attaching a PCI224 or PCI234 manually via the `COMEDI_DEVCONFIG`
ioctl, there are several options the user can supply that describe the
state of the hardware jumpers (LK1 for PCI224, LK1 thru LK5 for PCI234).
These options control how the driver sets up the AO range tables for the
device.  Those options are useless when the board is attached
automatically via the PCI driver probe function
`amplc_pci225_pci_probe()`, `comedi_pci_auto_config()`, and the
comedi driver "auto_attach" handler `pci224_auto_attach()`.

Rip out the range table selection options and use a single, static range
table per board type, containing all the software- and
hardware-selectable ranges for that board.  The PCI234 used to have a
per-channel `range_table_list` rather than an all-channel `range_table`,
as the jumpers selected different ranges for all channels.  Now that the
channels are using a unified range table, use an all-channel
`range_table` instead.

When checking the channel list for an asynchronous command in
`pci224_ao_check_chanlist()` make sure the ranges specified in the list
have compatible jumper settings.  We don't know how the jumpers are
actually set, but we can at least avoid conflicting settings.
