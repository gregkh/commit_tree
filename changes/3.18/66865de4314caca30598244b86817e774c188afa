of/irq: Drop obsolete 'interrupts' vs 'interrupts-extended' text

a9ecdc0fdc54 ("of/irq: Fix lookup to use 'interrupts-extended' property
first") updated the description to say that:

  - Both 'interrupts' and 'interrupts-extended' may be present
  - Software should prefer 'interrupts-extended'
  - Software that doesn't comprehend 'interrupts-extended' may use
    'interrupts'

But there is still a paragraph at the end that prohibits having both and
says 'interrupts' should be preferred.

Remove the contradictory text.
