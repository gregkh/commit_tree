PCI: pciehp: Configure hot-added display devices

We configure cache line size and other settings of hot-added devices, e.g.,
based on ACPI _HPP or _HPX methods.  Previously we skipped this for display
devices, but ACPI rev 5.0, sec 6.2.7 and 6.2.8 have no requirement to skip
them.

Remove the check so we configure display devices the same way we configure
other devices.

display devices").
