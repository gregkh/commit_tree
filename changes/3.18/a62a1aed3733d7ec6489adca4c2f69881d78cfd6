cfg80211: avoid duplicate entries on regdomain intersection

The regdom intersection code simply tries intersecting
each rule of the source with each rule of the target.

Since the resulting intersections are not observed
as a whole, this can result in multiple overlapping/duplicate
entries.

Make the rule addition a bit more smarter, by looking
for rules that can be contained within other rules,
and adding only extended ones.
