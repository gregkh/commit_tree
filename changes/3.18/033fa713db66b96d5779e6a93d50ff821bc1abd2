perf evlist: We need to poll all event file descriptors

Because we want to notice when they get POLLHUP'ed, so that we can
figure out when all threads exited in a workload being monitored.

We can't just monitor the fds that were mmaped, we need to notice when
all the fds that were PERF_EVENT_IOC_SET_OUTPUT'ed too, because the mmap
stays even after the fd that originally was used to do the mmap call
went away, its only when all the set-output fds for a mmap are gone that
the mmap is.
