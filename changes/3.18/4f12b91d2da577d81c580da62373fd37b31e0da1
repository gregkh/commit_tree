MIPS: cpu-probe: Set the write-combine CCA value on per core basis

Different cores use different CCA values to achieve write-combine
memory writes. For cores that do not support write-combine we
set the default value to CCA:2 (uncached, non-coherent) which is the
default value as set by the kernel.
