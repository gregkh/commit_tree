PCI: designware: Check private_data validity in single place

The driver had checks for this sprinkled all over.  As we call
sys_to_pcie() before every instance of this check, we can move the
check to this single location to make things clear.

Removing the statements after BUG[_ON]() is safe as the kernel is halted at
this point anyway.
