Return short read or 0 at end of a raw device, not EIO

Author: David Jeffery <djeffery@redhat.com>
Changes to the basic direct I/O code have broken the raw driver when reading
to the end of a raw device.  Instead of returning a short read for a read that
extends partially beyond the device's end or 0 when at the end of the device,
these reads now return EIO.

The raw driver needs the same end of device handling as was added for normal
block devices.  Using blkdev_read_iter, which has the needed size checks,
prevents the EIO conditions at the end of the device.
