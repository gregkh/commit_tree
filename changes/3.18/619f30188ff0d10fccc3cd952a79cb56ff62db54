ARC: Allow SMP kernel to build/boot on UP-only infrastructure

In light of recent SNAFU with SMP build, allow simple platform to build
as SMP but run UP.

* Remove the dependence on simulation SMP extension to enable quick
  build/test iterations of SMP kernel.

* In absence of platform SMP registration, prevent the NULL smp feature
  name from borkign the system
