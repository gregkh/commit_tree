KEYS: Implement binary asymmetric key ID handling

Implement the first step in using binary key IDs for asymmetric keys rather
than hex string keys.

The previously added match data preparsing will be able to convert hex
criterion strings into binary which can then be compared more rapidly.

Further, we actually want more then one ID string per public key.  The problem
is that X.509 certs refer to other X.509 certs by matching Issuer + AuthKeyId
to Subject + SubjKeyId, but PKCS#7 messages match against X.509 Issuer +
SerialNumber.

This patch just provides facilities for a later patch to make use of.
