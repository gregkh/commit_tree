ipv4: mentions skb_gro_postpull_rcsum() in inet_gro_receive()

Proper CHECKSUM_COMPLETE support needs to adjust skb->csum
when we remove one header. Its done using skb_gro_postpull_rcsum()

In the case of IPv4, we know that the adjustment is not really needed,
because the checksum over IPv4 header is 0. Lets add a comment to
ease code comprehension and avoid copy/paste errors.
