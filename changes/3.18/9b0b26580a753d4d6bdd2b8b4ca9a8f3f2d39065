arm64: efi: Fix stub cache maintenance

While efi-entry.S mentions that efi_entry() will have relocated the
kernel image, it actually means that efi_entry will have placed a copy
of the kernel in the appropriate location, and until this is branched to
at the end of efi_entry.S, all instructions are executed from the
original image.

Thus while the flush in efi_entry.S does ensure that the copy is visible
to noncacheable accesses, it does not guarantee that this is true for
the image instructions are being executed from. This could have
disasterous effects when the MMU and caches are disabled if the image
has not been naturally evicted to the PoC.

Additionally, due to a missing dsb following the ic ialluis, the new
kernel image is not necessarily clean in the I-cache when it is branched
to, with similar potentially disasterous effects.

This patch adds additional flushing to ensure that the currently
executing stub text is flushed to the PoC and is thus visible to
noncacheable accesses. As it is placed after the instructions cache
maintenance for the new image and __flush_dcache_area already contains a
dsb, we do not need to add a separate barrier to ensure completion of
the icache maintenance.

Comments are updated to clarify the situation with regard to the two
images and the maintenance required for both.
