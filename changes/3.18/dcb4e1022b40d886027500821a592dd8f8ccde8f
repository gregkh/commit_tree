perf tools: Parse the pmu event prefix and suffix

There are two types of event formats for PMU events. E.g. el-abort OR
cpu/el-abort/. However, the lexer mistakenly recognizes the simple style
format as two events.

The parse_events_pmu_check function uses bsearch to search the name in
known pmu event list. It can tell the lexer that the name is a PE_NAME
or a PMU event name prefix or a PMU event name suffix. All these
information will be used for accurately parsing kernel PMU events.

The pmu events list will be read from sysfs at runtime.

Note: Currently, the patch only want to handle the PMU event name as
"a-b" and "a". The only exception, "stalled-cycles-frontend" and
"stalled-cycles-fronted", are already hardcoded in lexer.
