MIPS: SEAD3: Nuke PIC32 I2C driver.

A platform driver for which nothing ever registers the corresponding
platform device.

Also it was driving the same hardware as sead3-i2c-drv.c so redundant
anyway and couldn't co-exist with that driver because each of them was
using a private spinlock to protect access to the same hardware
resources.

This also fixes a randconfig problem:

arch/mips/mti-sead3/sead3-pic32-i2c-drv.c: In function 'i2c_platform_probe':
arch/mips/mti-sead3/sead3-pic32-i2c-drv.c:345:2: error: implicit declaration of
function 'i2c_add_numbered_adapter' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  ret = i2c_add_numbered_adapter(&priv->adap);
    ^
arch/mips/mti-sead3/sead3-pic32-i2c-drv.c: In function
'i2c_platform_remove':
arch/mips/mti-sead3/sead3-pic32-i2c-drv.c:361:2: error: implicit declaration
