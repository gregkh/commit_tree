KVM: vmx: fix ept reserved bits for 1-GByte page

EPT misconfig handler in kvm will check which reason lead to EPT
misconfiguration after vmexit. One of the reasons is that an EPT
paging-structure entry is configured with settings reserved for
future functionality. However, the handler can't identify if
paging-structure entry of reserved bits for 1-GByte page are
configured, since PDPTE which point to 1-GByte page will reserve
bits 29:12 instead of bits 7:3 which are reserved for PDPTE that
references an EPT Page Directory. This patch fix it by reserve
bits 29:12 for 1-GByte page.
