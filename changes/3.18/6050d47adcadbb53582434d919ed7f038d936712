ext4: bail out from make_indexed_dir() on first error

When ext4_handle_dirty_dx_node() or ext4_handle_dirty_dirent_node()
fail, there's really something wrong with the fs and there's no point in
continuing further. Just return error from make_indexed_dir() in that
case. Also initialize frames array so that if we return early due to
error, dx_release() doesn't try to dereference uninitialized memory
(which could happen also due to error in do_split()).
