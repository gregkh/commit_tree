drm/i915: Fix secure dispatch with full ppgtt

Based upon a hunk from a patch from Chris Wilson, but augmented to:
- Process the batch in the full ppgtt vm so that self-relocations
  match again with userspace's expectations..
- Add a comment why plain pin for the global gtt binding is safe at
  that point.

v2: Drop local bind_vm variable (Chris).

v3: Explain why this works despite the lack of proper active tracking
for the ggtt batch vma.
