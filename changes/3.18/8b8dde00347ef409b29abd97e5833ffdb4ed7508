clocksource: arm_arch_timer: Enable counter access for 32-bit ARM

The only difference between arm and arm64's implementations of
arch_counter_set_user_access is that 32-bit ARM does not enable user
access to the virtual counter.  We want to enable this access for the
32-bit ARM VDSO, so copy the arm64 version to the driver itself, and
remove the arch-specific implementations.
