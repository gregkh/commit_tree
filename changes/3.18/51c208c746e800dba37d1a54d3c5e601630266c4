tools: ffs-test: convert to new descriptor format

Since commit [ac8dde11: “Add flags to descriptors block”] functionfs
supports a new, more powerful and extensible, descriptor format.
Since ffs-test is probably the first thing users of the functionfs
interface see when they start writing functionfs user space daemons,
convert it to use the new format thus promoting it.
