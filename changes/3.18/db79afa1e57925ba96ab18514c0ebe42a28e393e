sound/radeon: Move 64-bit MSI quirk from arch to driver

A number of radeon cards have a HW limitation causing them to be
unable to generate the full 64-bit of address bits for MSIs. This
breaks MSIs on some platforms such as POWER machines.

We used to have a powerpc specific quirk to address that on a
single card, but this doesn't scale very well, this is better
put under control of the drivers who know precisely what a given
HW revision can do.

We now have a generic quirk in the PCI code. We should set it
appropriately for all radeon's from the audio driver.
