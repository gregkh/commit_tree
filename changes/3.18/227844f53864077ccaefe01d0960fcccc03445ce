arm/arm64: KVM: Rename irq_state to irq_pending

The irq_state field on the distributor struct is ambiguous in its
meaning; the comment says it's the level of the input put, but that
doesn't make much sense for edge-triggered interrupts.  The code
actually uses this state variable to check if the interrupt is in the
pending state on the distributor so clarify the comment and rename the
actual variable and accessor methods.
