net: dsa: bcm_sf2: add suspend/resume callbacks

Implement the suspend/resume callbacks for the Broadcom Starfighter 2
switch driver. Suspending the switch requires masking interrupts and
shutting down ports. Resuming the switch requires a software reset since
we do not know which power-sate we might be coming from, and re-enabling
the physical ports that are used.
