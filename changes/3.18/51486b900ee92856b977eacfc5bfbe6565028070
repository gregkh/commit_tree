fix inode leaks on d_splice_alias() failure exits

d_splice_alias() callers expect it to either stash the inode reference
into a new alias, or drop the inode reference.  That makes it possible
to just return d_splice_alias() result from ->lookup() instance, without
any extra housekeeping required.

Unfortunately, that should include the failure exits.  If d_splice_alias()
returns an error, it leaves the dentry it has been given negative and
thus it *must* drop the inode reference.  Easily fixed, but it goes way
back and will need backporting.
