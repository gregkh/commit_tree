mac80211: Unify rate statistic variables between Minstrel & Minstrel_HT

Minstrel and Mintrel_HT used there own structs to keep track of rate
statistics. Unify those variables in struct minstrel_rate_states and
move it to rc80211_minstrel.h for common usage. This is a clean-up
patch to prepare Minstrel and Minstrel_HT codebase for upcoming TPC.
