nfsd4: fix crash on unknown operation number

Unknown operation numbers are caught in nfsd4_decode_compound() which
sets op->opnum to OP_ILLEGAL and op->status to nfserr_op_illegal.  The
error causes the main loop in nfsd4_proc_compound() to skip most
processing.  But nfsd4_proc_compound also peeks ahead at the next
operation in one case and doesn't take similar precautions there.
