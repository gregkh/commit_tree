gpio: acpi: normalize use of gpiochip_get_desc()

GPIO descriptors are changing from unique and permanent tokens to
allocated resources. Therefore gpiochip_get_desc() cannot be used as a
way to obtain a global GPIO descriptor anymore.

This patch updates the gpiolib ACPI support code to keep and use the
descriptor returned by a centralized call to gpiochip_get_desc().
