ARM: 8150/3: fiq: Replace default FIQ handler

This patch introduces a new default FIQ handler that is structured in a
similar way to the existing ARM exception handler and result in the FIQ
being handled by C code running on the SVC stack (despite this code run
in the FIQ handler is subject to severe limitations with respect to
locking making normal interaction with the kernel impossible).

This default handler allows concepts that on x86 would be handled using
NMIs to be realized on ARM.

    This patch is a near complete re-write of a patch originally
    provided by Anton Vorontsov. Today only a couple of small fragments
    survive, however without Anton's work to build from this patch would
    not exist. Thanks also to Russell King for spoonfeeding me a variety
    of fixes during the review cycle.
