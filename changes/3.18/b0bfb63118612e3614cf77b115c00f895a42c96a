lib: string: Make all calls to strnicmp into calls to strncasecmp

The previous patch made strnicmp into a wrapper for strncasecmp.

This patch makes all in-tree users of strnicmp call strncasecmp
directly, while still making sure that the strnicmp symbol can be used
by out-of-tree modules.  It should be considered a temporary hack until
all in-tree callers have been converted.
