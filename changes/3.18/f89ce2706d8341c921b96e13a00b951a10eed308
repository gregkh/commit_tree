hwmon: (k10temp) Add support for F15h M60h

This patch adds temperature monitoring support for F15h M60h processor.
 - Add new pci device id for the relevant processor
 - The functionality of REG_REPORTED_TEMPERATURE is moved to
   D0F0xBC_xD820_0CA4 [Reported Temperature Control]
   - So, use this to get CUR_TEMP value
   - Since we need an indirect register access, protect this with
     a mutex lock
 - Add Kconfig, Doc entries to indicate support for this processor.
