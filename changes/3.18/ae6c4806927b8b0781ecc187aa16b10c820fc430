drm/i915: Only track real ppgtt for a context

There's a bit a confusion since we track the global gtt,
the aliasing and real ppgtt in the ctx->vm pointer. And not
all callers really bother to check for the different cases and just
presume that it points to a real ppgtt.

Now looking closely we don't actually need ->vm to always point at an
address space - the only place that cares actually has fixup code
already to decide whether to look at the per-proces or the global
address space.

So switch to just tracking the ppgtt directly and ditch all the
extraneous code.

v2: Fixup the ppgtt debugfs file to not oops on a NULL ctx->ppgtt.
Also drop the early exit - without aliasing ppgtt we want to dump all
the ppgtts of the contexts if we have full ppgtt.

v3: Actually git add the compile fix.
