crypto: caam - disable RNG oscillator maximum frequency check

The rtfrqmax & rtfrqmin set the bounds of the expected frequency of the
oscillator, when SEC runs at its maximum frequency. For certain platforms
(f.i. T2080), the oscillator is very fast and thus if the SEC runs at
a lower than normal frequency, the ring oscillator is incorrectly detected
as being out of bounds.

This patch effectively disables the maximum frequency check, by setting a
high enough maximum allowable frequency for the oscillator. The reasoning
behind this is that usually a broken oscillator will run too slow
(i.e. not run at all) rather than run too fast.
