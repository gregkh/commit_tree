IB/iser: Use single CQ for RX and TX

This will solve a possible condition where we might miss TX completion
(flush error) during session teardown.  Since we are using a single
CQ, we don't need to actively drain the TX CQ, instead just wait for
flush_completion (when counters reach zero) and remove iser_poll_for_flush_errors().

This patch might introduce a minor performance regression on its own,
but the next patches will enhance performance using a single CQ for RX
and TX.
