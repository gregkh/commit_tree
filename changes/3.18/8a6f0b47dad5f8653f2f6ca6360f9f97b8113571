lib: rename TEST_MODULE to TEST_LKM

The "_MODULE" suffix is reserved for tristates compiled as loadable kernel
modules (LKM).  The "TEST_MODULE" feature thereby violates this
convention.  The feature is used to compile the lib/test_module.c kernel
module.

Sadly this convention is not made explicit, but the Kconfig code documents
it.  The following code (./scripts/kconfig/confdata.c) is used to generate
the autoconf.h header file during the build process.  When a feature is
selected as a kernel module ('m'), it is suffixed with "_MODULE" to
indicate it.

	switch (*value) {
	case 'n':
		break;
	case 'm':
		suffix = "_MODULE";
		/* fall through */

This causes problems for static code analysis, which assumes a consistent
use of the "_MODULE" suffix.

This patch renames the feature and its reference in a Makefile to
"TEST_LKM", which still expresses the test of a LKM.
