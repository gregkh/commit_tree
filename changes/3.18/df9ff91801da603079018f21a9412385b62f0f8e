Revert "ACPI / EC: Add support to disallow QR_EC to be issued before completing previous QR_EC"

It is reported that the following commit breaks Samsung hardware:
 Commit: 558e4736f2e1b0e6323adf7a5e4df77ed6cfc1a4.
 Subject: ACPI / EC: Add support to disallow QR_EC to be issued before
          completing previous QR_EC

Which means the Samsung behavior conflicts with the Acer behavior.

1. Samsung may behave like:
   [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
   [ +event 2 ] SCI_EVT set
                              write QR_EC
                              read event
   [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
   Without the above commit, Samsung can work:
   [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
   [ +event 2 ] SCI_EVT set
                              write QR_EC
                              CAN prepare next QR_EC as SCI_EVT=1
                              read event
   [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
                              write QR_EC
                              read event
   [ -event 2 ] SCI_EVT clear
   With the above commit, Samsung cannot work:
   [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
   [ +event 2 ] SCI_EVT set
                              write QR_EC
                              read event
   [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
                              CANNOT prepare next QR_EC as SCI_EVT=0
2. Acer may behave like:
   [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
   [ +event 2 ]
                              write QR_EC
                              read event
   [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
   [ +event 2 ] SCI_EVT set
   Without the above commit, Acer cannot work when there is only 1 event:
   [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
                              write QR_EC
                              can prepared next QR_EC as SCI_EVT=1
                              read event
   [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT clear
                              CANNOT write QR_EC as SCI_EVT=0
   With the above commit, Acer can work:
   [ +event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
   [ +event 2 ]
                              write QR_EC
                              read event
   [ -event 1 ] SCI_EVT set
                              can prepare next QR_EC because SCI_EVT=0
                              CAN write QR_EC as SCI_EVT=1

Since Acer can also work with only the following commit applied:
 Commit: 3afcf2ece453e1a8c2c6de19cdf06da3772a1b08
 Subject: ACPI / EC: Add support to disallow QR_EC to be issued when
          SCI_EVT isn't set
commit 558e4736f2e1b0e6323adf7a5e4df77ed6cfc1a4 can be reverted.
