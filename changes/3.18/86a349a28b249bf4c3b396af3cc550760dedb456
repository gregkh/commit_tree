perf/x86/intel: Add Broadwell core support

Add Broadwell support for Broadwell Client to perf.  This is very
similar to Haswell.  It uses a new cache event table, because there
were various changes there.

The constraint list has one new event that needs to be handled over
Haswell.

The PEBS event list is the same, so we reuse Haswell's.
