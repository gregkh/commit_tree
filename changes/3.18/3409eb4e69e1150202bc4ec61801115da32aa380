powerpc/pseries: Drop config requests in EEH accessors

The pSeires EEH config accessors rely on rtas_{read, write}_config()
and the condition to check if the PE's config space is blocked
should be moved to those 2 functions so that config requests from
kernel, userland, EEH core can be dropped to avoid recursive EEH error
if necessary.
