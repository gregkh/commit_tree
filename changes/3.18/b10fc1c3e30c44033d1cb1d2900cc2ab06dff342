perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix PCU filter setup for Sandy/Ivy/Haswell EP

The PCU frequency band filters use 8 bit each in a register.
When setting up the value the shift value was not correctly
scaled, which resulted in all filters except for band 0 to
be zero. Fix the scaling.

This allows to correctly monitor multiple uncore frequency bands.
