ipv4: fix nexthop attlen check in fib_nh_match

fib_nh_match does not match nexthops correctly. Example:

ip route add 172.16.10/24 nexthop via 192.168.122.12 dev eth0 \
                          nexthop via 192.168.122.13 dev eth0
ip route del 172.16.10/24 nexthop via 192.168.122.14 dev eth0 \
                          nexthop via 192.168.122.15 dev eth0

Del command is successful and route is removed. After this patch
applied, the route is correctly matched and result is:
RTNETLINK answers: No such process

Please consider this for stable trees as well.
