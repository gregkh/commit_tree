tracing: Clean up scheduling in trace_wakeup_test_thread()

Peter's new debugging tool triggers when tasks exit with !TASK_RUNNING.
The code in trace_wakeup_test_thread() also has a single schedule() call
that should be encompassed by a loop.

This cleans up the code a little to make it a bit more robust and
also makes the return exit properly with TASK_RUNNING.
