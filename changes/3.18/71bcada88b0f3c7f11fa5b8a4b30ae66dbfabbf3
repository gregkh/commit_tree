edac: altera: Add Altera SDRAM EDAC support

This patch adds support for the CycloneV and ArriaV SDRAM controllers.
Correction and reporting of SBEs, Panic on DBEs.

There was a discussion thread on whether this driver should be an mfd driver
or just make use of syscon, which is already a mfd. Ultimately, the
decision to use a simple syscon interface was reached.[1]
