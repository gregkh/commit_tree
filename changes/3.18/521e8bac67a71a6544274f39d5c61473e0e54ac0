perf/x86/intel/uncore: Update support for client uncore IMC PMU

This patch restructures the memory controller (IMC) uncore PMU support
for client SNB/IVB/HSW processors. The main change is that it can now
cope with more than one PCI device ID per processor model. There are
many flavors of memory controllers for each processor. They have
different PCI device ID, yet they behave the same w.r.t. the memory
controller PMU that we are interested in.

The patch now supports two distinct memory controllers for IVB
processors: one for mobile, one for desktop.
