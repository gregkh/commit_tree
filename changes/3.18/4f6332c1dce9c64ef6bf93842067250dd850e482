locktorture: Add infrastructure for torturing read locks

Most of it is based on what we already have for writers. This allows
readers to be very independent (and thus configurable), enabling
future module parameters to control things such as rw distribution.
Furthermore, readers have their own delaying function, allowing us
to test different rw critical region latencies, and stress locking
internals. Similarly, statistics, for now will only serve for the
number of lock acquisitions -- as opposed to writers, readers have
no failure detection.

In addition, introduce a new nreaders_stress module parameter. The
default number of readers will be the same number of writers threads.
Writer threads are interleaved with readers. Documentation is updated,
respectively.
