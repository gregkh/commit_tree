mm/vmalloc.c: use seq_open_private() instead of seq_open()

Using seq_open_private() removes boilerplate code from vmalloc_open().

The resultant code is shorter and easier to follow.

However, please note that seq_open_private() call kzalloc() rather than
kmalloc() which may affect timing due to the memory initialisation
overhead.
