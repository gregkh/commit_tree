ARM: dts: omap3: Add HEAD acoustics omap3-ha.dts and omap3-ha-lcd.dts (TAO3530 based)

These baseboards are equipped with the Technexion TAO35030 SOM. So
they include this dtsi. The common parts are extracted into an "common"
dtsi file. The main difference between both boards is, that the *lcd
has DSS support enabled for the LCD.

Some HEAD acoustics specific features are:

- LED handling
- Special FPGA/DSP audio driver (not included in this series)
- powerdown GPIO
