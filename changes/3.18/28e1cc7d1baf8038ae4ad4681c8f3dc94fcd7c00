Btrfs: Set real mirror number for read operation on RAID0/5/6

We need real mirror number for RAID0/5/6 when reading data, or if read error
happens, we would pass 0 as the number of the mirror on which the io error
happens. It is wrong and would cause the filesystem read the data from the
corrupted mirror again.
