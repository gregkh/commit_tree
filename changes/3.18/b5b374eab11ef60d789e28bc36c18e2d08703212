Workaround Mac server problem

Mac server returns that they support CIFS Unix Extensions but
doesn't actually support QUERY_FILE_UNIX_BASIC so mount fails.

Workaround this problem by disabling use of Unix CIFS protocol
extensions if server returns an EOPNOTSUPP error on
QUERY_FILE_UNIX_BASIC during mount.
