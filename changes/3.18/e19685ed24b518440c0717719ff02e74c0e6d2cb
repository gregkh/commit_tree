perf bench futex: Sanitize -q option in requeue

When given the number of threads to requeue at once by user input,
there's always the risk of this value being larger than the total number
of threads.  This doesn't make any sense, and the kernel can easily deal
with such sort of situations, hence no big deal. We should however
prevent bogus output such as:

./perf bench --repeat 2 futex requeue -q 10
Run summary [PID 22210]: Requeuing 4 threads (from [private] 0x99ef3c to 0x99ef38), 10 at a time.

[Run 1]: Requeued 10 of 4 threads in 0.0040 ms
[Run 2]: Requeued 10 of 4 threads in 0.0030 ms
Requeued 10 of 4 threads in 0.0035 ms (+-14.29%)
