staging/lustre/lvfs: fix building without CONFIG_PROC_FS

Patch "staging/lustre/lvfs: remove the lvfs layer" moved some code around
that was previously only built when CONFIG_PROC_FS was set, which now
causes an invalid access to the obd_memory variable:

ERROR: "obd_memory" [drivers/staging/lustre/lustre/obdclass/obdclass.ko] undefined!

This fixes it by using adding a compile-time check around the access.
