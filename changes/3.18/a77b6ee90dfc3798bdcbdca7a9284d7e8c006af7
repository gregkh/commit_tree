ahci_xgene: Fix the error print invalid resource for APM X-Gene SoC AHCI SATA Host Controller driver.

This patch fixes the error print invalid resource for the APM X-Gene
SoC AHCI SATA Host Controller driver. This print was due to the fact
that the controller 3 don't have a mux resource. This didn't result
in any errors but the print seems like meaningless.
