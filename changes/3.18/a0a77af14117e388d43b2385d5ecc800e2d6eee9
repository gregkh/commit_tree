crypto: LLVMLinux: Add macro to remove use of VLAIS in crypto code

Add a macro which replaces the use of a Variable Length Array In Struct (VLAIS)
with a C99 compliant equivalent. This macro instead allocates the appropriate
amount of memory using an char array.

The new code can be compiled with both gcc and clang.

struct shash_desc contains a flexible array member member ctx declared with
CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR, so sizeof(struct shash_desc) aligns the beginning
of the array declared after struct shash_desc with long long.

No trailing padding is required because it is not a struct type that can
be used in an array.

The CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR is required so that desc is aligned with long long
as would be the case for a struct containing a member with
CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR.

If you want to get to the ctx at the end of the shash_desc as before you can do
so using shash_desc_ctx(shash)
