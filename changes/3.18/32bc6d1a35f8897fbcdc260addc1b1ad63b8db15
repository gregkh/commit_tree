ath5k: Add missing vmalloc.h include.

After merging the wireless-next tree, today's linux-next build (powerpc
allyesconfig) failed like this:

drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/debug.c: In function 'open_file_eeprom':
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/debug.c:933:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'vmalloc' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  buf = vmalloc(eesize);
  ^
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/debug.c:933:6: warning: assignment makes pointer from integer without a cast
  buf = vmalloc(eesize);
      ^
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath5k/debug.c:960:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'vfree' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  vfree(buf);
  ^

Caused by commit db906eb2101b ("ath5k: added debugfs file for dumping
eeprom").  Also reported by Guenter Roeck.

I have used Geert Uytterhoeven's suggested fix of including vmalloc.h
and so added this patch for today:
