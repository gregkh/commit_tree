lib / string_helpers: move documentation to c-file

The introduced function string_escape_mem() is a kind of opposite to
string_unescape.  We have several users of such functionality each of
them created custom implementation.  The series contains clean up of
test suite, adding new call, and switching few users to use it via %*pE
specifier.

Test suite covers all of existing and most of potential use cases.

This patch (of 11):

The documentation of API belongs to c-file.  This patch moves it
accordingly.

There is no functional change.
