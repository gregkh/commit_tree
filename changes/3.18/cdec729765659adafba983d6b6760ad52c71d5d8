ASoC: fsl: Fix building of imx-es8328 on PPC

The imx-es8328 driver fails to build on PPC because it explicitly depends on
SND_SOC_IMX_PCM_FIQ, which itself doesn't build on PPC.  Instead, rely on
the SND_SOC_FSL_SSI config option to pull in the necessary libraries.

While we're at it, remove SND_SOC_FSL_UTILS, which also is not needed.
