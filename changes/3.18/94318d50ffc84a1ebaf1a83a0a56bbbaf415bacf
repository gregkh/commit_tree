drm/ttm: Clean usage of ttm_io_prot() with TTM_PL_FLAG_CACHED

Today, most callers of ttm_io_prot() check TTM_PL_FLAG_CACHED before
calling it since on some archs it will unconditionally create non-cached
mappings.

But not all callers do which is incorrect as far as I can tell.

Instead, move that check inside ttm_io_port() itself for all archs
and make powerpc use the same implementation as ia64 and arm
