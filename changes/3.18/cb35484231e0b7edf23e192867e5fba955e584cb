iscsi-target: remove always-true conditions

Found by coverity.  InitiatorName and InitiatorAlias are static arrays
and therefore always non-NULL.  At some point in the past they may have
been dynamically allocated, but for current code the condition is
useless.  If the intent was to check InitiatorName[0] instead, I cannot
find a use for that either.  Let's get rid of it.
