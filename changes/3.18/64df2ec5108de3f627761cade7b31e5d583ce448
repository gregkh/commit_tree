GenWQE: Remove sysfs entry for driver version

A special sysfs entry to display the driver version is not
needed. We left the driver version and adjusted it to the
naming a lot of other drivers use. The information can be
retrieved by using modinfo genwqe_card.

modinfo genwqe_card will provide the same information.
