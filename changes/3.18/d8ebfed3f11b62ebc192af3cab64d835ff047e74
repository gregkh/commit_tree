net: phy: bcm7xxx: utilize PHY revision in config_init

Now that the GENET and SF2 drivers have been updated to communicate us
what is the revision of the BCM7xxx integrated PHY, utilize that
information in the config_init() callback to call into the appropriate
workaround function based on our revision.

While at it, we also print the revision and patch level to help debug
new chips.
