kvm: Make init_rmode_tss() return 0 on success.

In init_rmode_tss(), there two variables indicating the return
value, r and ret, and it return 0 on error, 1 on success. The function
is only called by vmx_set_tss_addr(), and ret is redundant.

This patch removes the redundant variable, by making init_rmode_tss()
return 0 on success, -errno on failure.
