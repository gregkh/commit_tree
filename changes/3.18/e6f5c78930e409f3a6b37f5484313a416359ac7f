locks: plumb a "priv" pointer into the setlease routines

In later patches, we're going to add a new lock_manager_operation to
finish setting up the lease while still holding the i_lock.  To do
this, we'll need to pass a little bit of info in the fcntl setlease
case (primarily an fasync structure). Plumb the extra pointer into
there in advance of that.

We declare this pointer as a void ** to make it clear that this is
private info, and that the caller isn't required to set this unless
the lm_setup specifically requires it.
