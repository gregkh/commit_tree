NFC: trf7970a: Don't assume CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is enabled

The current code assumes that CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME
is always defined so it won't power up the trf7970a
when it isn't enabled.  Fix this by moving the power
up/down code from the pm_runtime_resume/suspend
routines into their own routines and calling the
power up function from the probe routine.  This
ensures the device is powered up even when
CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is not defined.

In order to not power on/off a device that is
already powered on/off, create a new state to
indicate that the power is off (TRF7970A_ST_PWR_OFF).
