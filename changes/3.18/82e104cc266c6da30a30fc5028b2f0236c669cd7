drm/i915/bdw: New logical ring submission mechanism

Well, new-ish: if all this code looks familiar, that's because it's
a clone of the existing submission mechanism (with some modifications
here and there to adapt it to LRCs and Execlists).

And why did we do this instead of reusing code, one might wonder?
Well, there are some fears that the differences are big enough that
they will end up breaking all platforms.

Also, Execlists offer several advantages, like control over when the
GPU is done with a given workload, that can help simplify the
submission mechanism, no doubt. I am interested in getting Execlists
to work first and foremost, but in the future this parallel submission
mechanism will help us to fine tune the mechanism without affecting
old gens.

v2: Pass the ringbuffer only (whenever possible).
