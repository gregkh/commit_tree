ARM: Kirkwood: Fix DT based DSA.

During the conversion of boards to use DT to instantiate Distributed
Switch Architecture, nobody volunteered to test. As to be expected,
the conversion was flawed. Testers and access to hardware has now
become available, and this patch hopefully fixes the problems.

dsa,mii-bus must be a phandle to the top level mdio node, not the port
specific subnode of the mdio device.

dsa,ethernet must be a phandle to the port subnode within the ethernet
DT node, not the ethernet node.

Don't pinctrl hog the card detect gpio for mvsdio.

Rename the .dts files to make it clearer which file is for the Z0
stepping and which for the A0 or later stepping.
