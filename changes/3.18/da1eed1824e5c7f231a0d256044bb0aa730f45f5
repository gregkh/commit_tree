staging: comedi: adl_pci6208: use comedi_subdevice 'readback'

Use the new comedi_subdevice 'readback' member and the core provided
(*insn_read) for the readback of the analog output subdevice channels.

The loop used to write the values could timeout. Move the saving of
the readback value so that the last value written is always saved.

Remove the unused private data and its allocation.
