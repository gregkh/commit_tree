rcu: Use pr_alert/pr_cont for printing logs

User pr_alert/pr_cont for printing the logs from rcutorture module directly
instead of writing it to a buffer and then printing it. This allows us from not
having to allocate such buffers. Also remove a resulting empty function.

I tested this using the parse-torture.sh script as follows:

$ dmesg | grep torture > log.txt
$ bash parse-torture.sh log.txt test
$

There were no warnings which means that parsing went fine.
