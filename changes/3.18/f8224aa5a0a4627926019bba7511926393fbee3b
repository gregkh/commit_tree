mm, compaction: do not recheck suitable_migration_target under lock

isolate_freepages_block() rechecks if the pageblock is suitable to be a
target for migration after it has taken the zone->lock.  However, the
check has been optimized to occur only once per pageblock, and
compact_checklock_irqsave() might be dropping and reacquiring lock, which
means somebody else might have changed the pageblock's migratetype
meanwhile.

Furthermore, nothing prevents the migratetype to change right after
isolate_freepages_block() has finished isolating.  Given how imperfect
this is, it's simpler to just rely on the check done in
isolate_freepages() without lock, and not pretend that the recheck under
lock guarantees anything.  It is just a heuristic after all.
