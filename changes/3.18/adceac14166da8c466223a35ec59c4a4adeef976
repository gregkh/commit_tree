usb: serial: xsens_mt: always bind to interface number 1

Probe is testing if the current interface provides two bulk endpoints.
While this achieves the goal of only binding to the correct interface,
we already know we can find the device on interface number 1. Stop
checking the endpoints and just return successfully when interface
number 1 is probed.
