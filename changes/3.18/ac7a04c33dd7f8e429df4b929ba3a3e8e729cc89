net: dsa: change tag_protocol to an enum

Now that we introduced an additional multiplexing/demultiplexing layer
with commit 3e8a72d1dae37 ("net: dsa: reduce number of protocol hooks")
that lives within the DSA code, we no longer need to have a given switch
driver tag_protocol be an actual ethertype value, instead, we can
replace it with an enum: dsa_tag_protocol.

Do this replacement in the drivers, which allows us to get rid of the
cpu_to_be16()/htons() dance, and remove ETH_P_BRCMTAG since we do not
need it anymore.
