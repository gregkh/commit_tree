UBIFS: fix free log space calculation

Hu (hujianyang <hujianyang@huawei.com>) discovered an issue in the
'empty_log_bytes()' function, which calculates how many bytes are left in the
log:

"
If 'c->lhead_lnum + 1 == c->ltail_lnum' and 'c->lhead_offs == c->leb_size', 'h'
would equalent to 't' and 'empty_log_bytes()' would return 'c->log_bytes'
instead of 0.
"

At this point it is not clear what would be the consequences of this, and
whether this may lead to any problems, but this patch addresses the issue just
in case.
