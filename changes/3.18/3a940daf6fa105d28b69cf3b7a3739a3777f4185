IB/iser: Protect tasks cleanup in case IB device was already released

Bailout in case a task cleanup (iscsi_iser_cleanup_task) is called
after the IB device was removed (DEVICE_REMOVAL CM event).  We also
call iscsi_conn_stop with a lock taken to prevent DEVICE_REMOVAL and
tasks cleanup from racing.
