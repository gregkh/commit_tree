tipc: fix bug in bundled buffer reception

In commit ec8a2e5621db2da24badb3969eda7fd359e1869f ("tipc: same receive
code path for connection protocol and data messages") we omitted the
the possiblilty that an arriving message extracted from a bundle buffer
may be a multicast message. Such messages need to be to be delivered to
the socket via a separate function, tipc_sk_mcast_rcv(). As a result,
small multicast messages arriving as members of a bundle buffer will be
silently dropped.

This commit corrects the error by considering this case in the function
tipc_link_bundle_rcv().
