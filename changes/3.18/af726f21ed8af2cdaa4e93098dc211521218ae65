x86_64, traps: Fix the espfix64 #DF fixup and rewrite it in C

There's nothing special enough about the espfix64 double fault fixup to
justify writing it in assembly.  Move it to C.

This also fixes a bug: if the double fault came from an IST stack, the
old asm code would return to a partially uninitialized stack frame.
