spi: sirf: correct spi gpio and hardware chipselect behaviour

the old codes check the cs-gpios, if the gpio number is 0 like:
<&gpio, 0, 0>, the driver will use the only hardware chipselect.

this is wrong because of_spi_register_master() can read property
cs-gpios from device node and set the spi master's cs number and
gpio cs automatically based on whether the cs-gpios is valid.

this patch fixes the beviour of CSR spi driver and move to a core
level supported way.
