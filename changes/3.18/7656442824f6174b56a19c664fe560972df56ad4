r8169:for function "rtl_w1w0_phy" change its name and behavior

Change function name from "rtl_w1w0_phy" to "rtl_w0w1_phy".
And its behavior from "write ones then write zeros" to
"write zeros then write ones".

In Realtek internal driver, bitwise operations are almost "write zeros then
write ones". For easy to port hardware parameters from Realtek internal driver
to Linux kernal driver "r8169", we would like to change this function's
behavior and its name.
