mlx4: add a new xmit_more counter

ethtool -S reports a new counter, tracking number of time doorbell
was not triggered, because skb->xmit_more was set.

$ ethtool -S eth0 | egrep "tx_packet|xmit_more"
     tx_packets: 2413288400
     xmit_more: 666121277

I merged the tso_packet false sharing avoidance in this patch as well.
