serial: 8250: Add Quark X1000 to 8250_pci.c

Quark X1000 contains two designware derived 8250 serial ports.
Each port has a unique PCI configuration space consisting of
BAR0:UART BAR1:DMA respectively.

Unlike the standard 8250 the register width is 32 bits for RHR,IER etc
The Quark UART has a fundamental clock @ 44.2368 MHz allowing for a
bitrate of up to about 2.76 megabits per second.

This patch enables standard 8250 mode
