qla2xxx: Prevent removal and board_disable race

Introduce mutual exclusion between the qla2xxx_remove_one PCI driver
callback and qla2x00_disable_board_on_pci_error, which is scheduled as
board_disable work by qla2x00_check_reg{32,16}_for_disconnect:

* Leave the driver-specific data attached to the underlying PCI device
intact in qla2x00_disable_board_on_pci_error, so that qla2x00_remove_one
has enough breadcrumbs to determine that any board_disable work has been
completed.

* In qla2xxx_remove_one, set a bit to prevent any subsequent
board_disable work from scheduling, then cancel and wait until pending
work has completed.

* Reuse the PCI device enable count check in qla2x00_remove_one to
determine if board_disable has occured. The original purpose of this
check was unnecessary since the driver remove function wasn't called
when the probe fails.
