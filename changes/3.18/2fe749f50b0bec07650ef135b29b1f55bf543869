parisc: Use compat layer for msgctl, shmat, shmctl and semtimedop syscalls

Switch over the msgctl, shmat, shmctl and semtimedop syscalls to use the compat
layer. The problem was found with the debian procenv package, which called
	shmctl(0, SHM_INFO, &info);
in which the shmctl syscall then overwrote parts of the surrounding areas on
the stack on which the info variable was stored and thus lead to a segfault
later on.

Additionally fix the definition of struct shminfo64 to use unsigned longs like
the other architectures. This has no impact on userspace since we only have a
32bit userspace up to now.
