staging: comedi: amplc_pci224: put board indices in PCI driver_data

The `driver_data` member value from the matched entry of the PCI module
device table `amplc_pci224_pci_table[]` is passed through to our comedi
"auto_attach" handler, `pci224_auto_attach()`.  Use that to index
directly into our static board data array `pci224_boards[]` instead of
calling `pci224_find_pci_board()` to search for the entry matching the
PCI device ID.  That function can be removed.  The `devid` and `model`
members of `struct pci224_board` are no longer needed either and can be
removed.
