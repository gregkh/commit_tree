powerpc/cell: Move spu_handle_mm_fault() out of cell platform

Currently spu_handle_mm_fault() is in the cell platform.

This code is generically useful for other non-cell co-processors on powerpc.

This patch moves this function out of the cell platform into arch/powerpc/mm so
that others may use it.
