ipvs: Supply destination address family to ip_vs_conn_new

The assumption that dest af is equal to service af is now unreliable, so we
must specify it manually so as not to copy just the first 4 bytes of a v6
address or doing an illegal read of 16 butes on a v6 address.

We "lie" in two places: for synchronization (which we will explicitly
disallow from happening when we have heterogeneous pools) and for black
hole addresses where there's no real dest.
