sparc64: Use kernel page tables for vmemmap.

For sparse memory configurations, the vmemmap array behaves terribly
and it takes up an inordinate amount of space in the BSS section of
the kernel image unconditionally.

Just build huge PMDs and look them up just like we do for TLB misses
in the vmalloc area.

Kernel BSS shrinks by about 2MB.
