netfilter: nat: move specific NAT IPv6 to core

Move the specific NAT IPv6 core functions that are called from the
hooks from ip6table_nat.c to nf_nat_l3proto_ipv6.c. This prepares the
ground to allow iptables and nft to use the same NAT engine code that
comes in a follow up patch.

This also renames nf_nat_ipv6_fn to nft_nat_ipv6_fn in
net/ipv6/netfilter/nft_chain_nat_ipv6.c to avoid a compilation breakage.
