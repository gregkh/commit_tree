bridge: include in6.h in if_bridge.h for struct in6_addr

if_bridge.h uses struct in6_addr ip6, but wasn't including the in6.h
header.  Thomas Backlund originally sent a patch to do this, but this
revealed a redefinition issue: https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/1/13/116

The redefinition issue should have been fixed by the following Linux
commits:
ee262ad827f89e2dc7851ec2986953b5b125c6bc inet: defines IPPROTO_* needed for module alias generation
cfd280c91253cc28e4919e349fa7a813b63e71e8 net: sync some IP headers with glibc

and the following glibc commit:
6c82a2f8d7c8e21e39237225c819f182ae438db3 Coordinate IPv6 definitions for Linux and glibc

so actually include the header now.
