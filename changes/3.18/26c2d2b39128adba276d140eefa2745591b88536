i386/audit: stop scribbling on the stack frame

git commit b4f0d3755c5e9cc86292d5fd78261903b4f23d4a was very very dumb.
It was writing over %esp/pt_regs semi-randomly on i686  with the expected
"system can't boot" results.  As noted in:

https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=85277

This patch stops fscking with pt_regs.  Instead it sets up the registers
for the call to __audit_syscall_entry in the most obvious conceivable
way.  It then does just a tiny tiny touch of magic.  We need to get what
started in PT_EDX into 0(%esp) and PT_ESI into 4(%esp).  This is as easy
as a pair of pushes.

After the call to __audit_syscall_entry all we need to do is get that
now useless junk off the stack (pair of pops) and reload %eax with the
original syscall so other stuff can keep going about it's business.
