ASoC: Cleanup DAI module reference counting

Currently when a DAI has no CODEC associated to it the reference on the module
containing the DAI driver is increased when the DAI is probed and decrease when
the DAI is removed. For DAIs with CODECs the module reference count was already
incremented when the CODEC is probed. Now that all components have their module
reference count incremented when they are probed and all DAIs do have a
component it is possible to remove the module reference counting on DAI probe
and removal.
