ftrace: Add separate function for non recursive callbacks

Instead of using the generic list function for callbacks that
are not recursive, call a new helper function from the mcount
trampoline called ftrace_ops_recur_func() that will do the recursion
checking for the callback.

This eliminates an indirection as well as will help in future code
that will use dynamically allocated trampolines.
