sched/deadline: Fix inter- exclusive cpusets migrations

Users can perform clustered scheduling using the cpuset facility.
After an exclusive cpuset is created, task migrations happen only
between CPUs belonging to the same cpuset. Inter- cpuset migrations
can only happen when the user requires so, moving a task between
different cpusets. This behaviour is broken in SCHED_DEADLINE, as
currently spurious inter- cpuset migration may happen without user
intervention.

This patch fix the problem (and shuffles the code a bit to improve
clarity).
