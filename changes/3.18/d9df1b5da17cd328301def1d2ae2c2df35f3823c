powerpc/powernv: Clear PAPR error injection registers

The frozen state on one specific PE is probably caused by error
injection, which is done with help of PAPR error injection registers.
According to the hardware spec, those registers should be cleared
automatically after one-shot frozen PE. However, that's not always
true, at least on P7IOC of Firebird-L. So we have to clear them
before doing PE reset to avoid recursive EEH errors at recovery
stage.
