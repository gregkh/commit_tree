gpio: Increase ARCH_NR_GPIOs to 512

Some newer Intel SoCs, like Braswell already have more than 256 GPIOs
available so the default limit is exceeded. Instead of adding more
architecture specific gpio.h files with custom ARCH_NR_GPIOs we increase
the gpiolib default limit to be twice the current.

Current generic ARCH_NR_GPIOS limit is 256 which starts to be too small
for newer Intel SoCs like Braswell. In order to support GPIO controllers
on these SoCs we increase ARCH_NR_GPIOS to be 512 which should be
sufficient for now.

The kernel size increases a bit with this change. Below is an example of
x86_64 kernel image.

ARCH_NR_GPIOS=256
 text     data    bss     dec      hex    filename
 11476173 1971328 1265664 14713165 e0814d vmlinux

ARCH_NR_GPIOS=512
 text     data    bss     dec      hex    filename
 11476173 1971328 1269760 14717261 e0914d vmlinux

So the BSS size and this the kernel image size increases by 4k.
