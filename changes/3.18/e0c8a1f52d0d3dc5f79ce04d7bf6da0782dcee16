mfd: menelaus: Remove null pointer dereference

If vtg is NULL, it is not possible to access its mode_reg field. At all
sites where the static function menelaus_set_voltage is called, the first
argument is the address of a structure defined in the file. So, the null
test is unnecessary and is removed. Also, a label is done away with.

This problem was found using the following Coccinelle semantic match:

// <smpl>
@@
expression E, E1;
identifier f;
statement S1,S2,S3;
@@

* if (E == NULL)
{
  ... when != if (E == NULL) S1 else S2
      when != E = E1
* E->f
  ... when any
  return ...;
}
else S3
// </smpl>
