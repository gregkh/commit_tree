ASoC: Move component->probed check into soc_{remove,probe}_component()

Having the check in a centralized place makes the code a bit cleaner and
shorter.

Note: There is a slight semantic change in this patch. soc_probe_aux_dev() will
no longer return -EBUSY if the AUX dev has already been probed before. This is
fine though since it will simply do nothing in that case and return success.
