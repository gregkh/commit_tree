dm bufio: when done scanning return from __scan immediately

When __scan frees the required number of buffer entries that the
shrinker requested (nr_to_scan becomes zero) it must return.  Before
this fix the __scan code exited only the inner loop and continued in the
outer loop -- which could result in reduced performance due to extra
buffers being freed (e.g. unnecessarily evicted thinp metadata needing
to be synchronously re-read into bufio's cache).

Also, move dm_bufio_cond_resched to __scan's inner loop, so that
iterating the bufio client's lru lists doesn't result in scheduling
latency.
