target: Don't call TFO->write_pending if data_length == 0

If an initiator sends a zero-length command (e.g. TEST UNIT READY) but
sets the transfer direction in the transport layer to indicate a
data-out phase, we still shouldn't try to transfer data.  At best it's
a NOP, and depending on the transport, we might crash on an
uninitialized sg list.
