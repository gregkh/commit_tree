Bluetooth: Fix HCI H5 corrupted ack value

In this expression: seq = (seq - 1) % 8
seq (u8) is implicitly converted to an int in the arithmetic operation.
So if seq value is 0, operation is ((0 - 1) % 8) => (-1 % 8) => -1.
The new seq value is 0xff which is an invalid ACK value, we expect 0x07.
It leads to frequent dropped ACK and retransmission.
Fix this by using '&' binary operator instead of '%'.
