i40e: ATR policy change to flush the table to clean stale ATR rules

Instead of disabling ATR when we get a programming error, we now
will wait it out to see if some room gets created by ATR rule deletion.
If we still have too many errors and ATR filter count did not change
much, its time to flush and replay. We no more auto-disable ATR when
we have errors in programming.
The disabling of ATR when we get programming error was buggy and
was still adding new rules and causing continuous errors. With this
policy change we flush instead when we see too many errors.
ATR is still disabled if we add a SB rule for TCP/IPv4 flow type,
more logic is added to re-enable it once all SB TCP/IPv4 rules are gone.
