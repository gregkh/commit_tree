m68k: Disable/restore interrupts in hwreg_present()/hwreg_write()

hwreg_present() and hwreg_write() temporarily change the VBR register to
another vector table. This table contains a valid bus error handler
only, all other entries point to arbitrary addresses.

If an interrupt comes in while the temporary table is active, the
processor will start executing at such an arbitrary address, and the
kernel will crash.

While most callers run early, before interrupts are enabled, or
explicitly disable interrupts, Finn Thain pointed out that macsonic has
one callsite that doesn't, causing intermittent boot crashes.
There's another unsafe callsite in hilkbd.

Fix this for good by disabling and restoring interrupts inside
hwreg_present() and hwreg_write().

Explicitly disabling interrupts can be removed from the callsites later.
