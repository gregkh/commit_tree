nfsd3: Check write permission after checking existence

When creating a file that already exists in a read-only directory with
O_EXCL, the NFSv3 server returns EACCES rather than EEXIST (which local
files and the NFSv4 server return).  Fix this by checking the MAY_CREATE
permission only if the file does not exist.  Since this already happens
in do_nfsd_create, the check in nfsd3_proc_create can simply be removed.
