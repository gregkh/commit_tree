selftests/net: psock_fanout seg faults in sock_fanout_read_ring()

The while loop in sock_fanout_read_ring() checks mmap region
bounds after access, causing it to segfault. Fix it to check
count before accessing header->tp_status. This problem can be
reproduced consistently when the test in run as follows:

    make -C tools/testing/selftests TARGETS=net run_tests
    or
    make run_tests from tools/testing/selftests
    or
    make run_test from tools/testing/selftests/net
