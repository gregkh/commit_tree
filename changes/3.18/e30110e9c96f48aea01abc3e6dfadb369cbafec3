charger: max14577: Configure battery-dependent settings from DTS and sysfs

Remove hard-coded values for:
 - Fast Charge current,
 - End Of Charge current,
 - Fast Charge timer,
 - Overvoltage Protection Threshold,
 - Battery Constant Voltage,
and use DTS or sysfs to configure them. This allows using the max14577 charger
driver with different batteries.

Now the charger driver requires valid configuration data from DTS. In
case of wrong configuration data it fails during probe.

The fast charge timer is configured through sysfs entry.
