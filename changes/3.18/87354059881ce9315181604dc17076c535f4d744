ftrace: Add helper function ftrace_ops_get_func()

Add the helper function to what the mcount trampoline is to call
for a ftrace_ops function. This helper will be used by arch code
in the future to set up dynamic trampolines. But as this does the
same tests that are performed in choosing what function to call for
the default mcount trampoline, might as well use it to clean up
the existing code.
