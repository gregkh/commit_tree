target: Add force_pr_aptpl device attribute

This patch adds a force_pr_aptpl device attribute used to force SPC-3 PR
Activate Persistence across Target Power Loss (APTPL) operation.  This
makes PR metadata write-out occur during state change regardless if new
PERSISTENT_RESERVE_OUT CDBs have their APTPL feature bit set.

This is useful during H/A failover in active/passive setups where all PR
state is being re-created on a different node, driven by configfs backend
device + export layout and pre-loaded $DEV/pr/res_aptpl_metadata.
