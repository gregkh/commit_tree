drm: Clarify vblank ts/scanoutpos sampling #defines

I've read INVBL as "invalid backlight" and got mightly confused.
The #defines are already fairly long and we can afford to extend
them a bit more without resulting in ugly code all over.

I'm not sure how useful the complicated bitmask return value of these
functions really are since no one checks them. But for now let's keep
things as is.
