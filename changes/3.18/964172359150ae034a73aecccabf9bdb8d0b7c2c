staging: vt6655: rxtx create new structure vnt_tx_short_buf_head for csBeacon_xmit

This is a merger of PSTxDataHead_ab and PSTxShortBufHead of which typedef struct tagSTxShortBufHead
is removed.

This is formed as fifo_ctl, time_stamp, struct vnt_phy_field, duration and time_stamp_off.

Replacing stuctures in csBeacon_xmit and doing endian correction where necessary.
