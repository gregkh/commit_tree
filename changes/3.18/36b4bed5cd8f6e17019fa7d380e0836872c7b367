cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix setting max_perf_pct in performance policy

Code which changes policy to powersave changes also max_policy_pct based on
max_freq. Code which change max_perf_pct has upper limit base on value
max_policy_pct. When policy is changing from powersave back to performance
then max_policy_pct is not changed. Which means that changing max_perf_pct is
not possible to high values if max_freq was too low in powersave policy.

Test case:

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_min_freq
800000
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
3300000
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
performance
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct
100

$ echo powersave > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$ echo 800000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
$ echo 20 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
powersave
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
800000
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct
20

$ echo performance > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
$ echo 3300000 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
$ echo 100 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
performance
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_max_freq
3300000
$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate/max_perf_pct
24

And now intel_pstate driver allows to set maximal value for max_perf_pct based
on max_policy_pct which is 24 for previous powersave max_freq 800000.

This patch will set default value for max_policy_pct when setting policy to
performance so it will allow to set also max value for max_perf_pct.
