uas: Do not use scsi_host_find_tag

Using scsi_host_find_tag with tags returned by the device is unsafe for
multiple reasons:

1) It returns tags->rqs[tag], which may be non NULL even when the cmnd is
   not owned by us
2) It returns tags->rqs[tag], without holding any locks protecting it
3) It returns tags->rqs[tag], without doing any boundary checking

Instead keep our own list which maps tags -> inflight cmnds.
