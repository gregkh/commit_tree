Staging: lustre: Replace GOTO macro with necessary code

The GOTO macro is neither standard in Linux nor does its definiton
contain much useful code. Hence GOTO can be replaced with useful
parts of its definition. In a statement like GOTO(label, rc), the
replacing code will be goto label if rc is a constant or a variable.
But in cases like GOTO(label, e) where e is an assignment statement,
both assignment and goto statements are kept.

This patch was done using Coccinelle and the following semantic
patch was used:

@@
identifier rc,label;
expression e;
constant c;
@@

(
-GOTO(label,rc = e);
+rc = e;
+goto label;
|
-GOTO(label,rc);
+goto label;
|
-GOTO(label,c);
+goto label;
)
