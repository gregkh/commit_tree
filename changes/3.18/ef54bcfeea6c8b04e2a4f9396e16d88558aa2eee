KVM: x86: skip writeback on injection of nested exception

If a nested page fault happens during emulation, we will inject a vmexit,
not a page fault.  However because writeback happens after the injection,
we will write ctxt->eip from L2 into the L1 EIP.  We do not write back
if an instruction caused an interception vmexit---do the same for page
faults.
