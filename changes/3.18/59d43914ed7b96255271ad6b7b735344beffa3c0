vfs: make guard_bh_eod() more generic

This patchset implements readpages() operation for block device by using
mpage_readpages() which can create multipage BIOs instead of BIOs for each
page and reduce system CPU time consumption.

This patch (of 3):

guard_bh_eod() is used in submit_bh() to allow us to do IO even on the odd
last sectors of a device, even if the block size is some multiple of the
physical sector size.  This makes guard_bh_eod() more generic and renames
it guard_bio_eod() so that we can use it without struct buffer_head
argument.

The reason for this change is that using mpage_readpages() for block
device requires to add this guard check in mpage code.
