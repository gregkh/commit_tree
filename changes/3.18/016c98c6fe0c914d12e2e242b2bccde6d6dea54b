virtio: unify config_changed handling

Replace duplicated code in all transports with a single wrapper in
virtio.c.

The only functional change is in virtio_mmio.c: if a buggy device sends
us an interrupt before driver is set, we previously returned IRQ_NONE,
now we return IRQ_HANDLED.

As this must not happen in practice, this does not look like a big deal.
