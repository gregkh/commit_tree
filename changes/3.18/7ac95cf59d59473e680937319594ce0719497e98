[media] firewire: firedtv-avc: fix more potential buffer overflow

"program_info_length" is user controlled and can go up to 4095.  The
operand[] array has 509 bytes so we need to add a limit here to prevent
buffer overflows.

The " - 4" in the limit check is because we have 4 bytes more data to
add after the memcpy().

 to rebase to apply just the differences between v1 and v2]
