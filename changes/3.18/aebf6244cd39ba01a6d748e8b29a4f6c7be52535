bnx2x: Be more forgiving toward SW GRO

This introduces 2 new relaxations in the bnx2x driver regarding GRO:
  1. Don't prevent SW GRO if HW GRO is disabled.
  2. If all aggregations are disabled, when GRO configuration changes
     there's no need to perform an inner-reload [since it will have no
     actual effect].
