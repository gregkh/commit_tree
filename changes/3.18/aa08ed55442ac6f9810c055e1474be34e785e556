MIPS: loongson2_cpufreq: Fix CPU clock rate setting mismerge

During 3.16 merge window, parts of the commit 8e8acb32960f
(MIPS/loongson2_cpufreq: Fix CPU clock rate setting) seem to have
been deleted probably due to a mismerge, and as a result cpufreq
is broken again on Loongson2 boards in 3.16 and newer kernels.
Fix by repeating the fix.
