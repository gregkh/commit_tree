drm: add driver->set_busid() callback

One step closer to dropping all the drm_bus_* code:
Add a driver->set_busid() callback and make all drivers use the generic
helpers. Nouveau is the only driver that uses two different bus-types with
the same drm_driver. This is totally broken if both buses are available on
the same machine (unlikely, but lets be safe). Therefore, we create two
different drivers for each platform during module_init() and set the
set_busid() callback respectively.
