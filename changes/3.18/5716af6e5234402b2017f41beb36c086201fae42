IB/iser: Rename ib_conn -> iser_conn

Two reasons why we choose to do this:

1. No point today calling struct iser_conn by another name ib_conn
2. In the next patches we will restructure iser control plane representation
   - struct iser_conn: connection logical representation
   - struct ib_conn: connection RDMA layout representation

This patch does not change any functionality.
