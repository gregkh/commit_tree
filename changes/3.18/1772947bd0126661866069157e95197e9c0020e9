rcu: Handle NOCB callbacks from irq-disabled idle code

If an RCU callback is queued on a no-CBs CPU from idle code with irqs
disabled, and if that CPU stays idle forever after, the callback will
never be invoked.  This commit therefore adds a check for this situation
in ____call_rcu_nocb(), invoking the RCU core solely for the purpose
of the ensuing return-to-idle transition.  (If the CPU doesn't return
to idle, the next scheduling-clock interrupt will fix things up.)
