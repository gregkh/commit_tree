parport: parport_pc: Implement architecture and device check to cut off false-positives

We definitely know that only x86 (32-bit) architecture is affected by the issue, so implement a stub instead of the actual check for other architectures.

We also know that motherboard LPT chipset is affected, so the port is either come from
  parport_pc_init (when `io' module param is used) or
  parport_pc_find_isa_ports (when default LPT ports are probbed: 0x378, 0x278, 0x3bc).
In both cases the port considered as 'legacy' and `dev' member of struct parport is NULL. See also comments for `struct parport' in parport.h
