xen-scsifront: Add Xen PV SCSI frontend driver

Introduces the Xen pvSCSI frontend. With pvSCSI it is possible for a
Xen domU to issue SCSI commands to a SCSI LUN assigned to that
domU. The SCSI commands are passed to the pvSCSI backend in a driver
domain (usually Dom0) which is owner of the physical device. This
allows e.g. to use SCSI tape drives in a Xen domU.

The code is taken from the pvSCSI implementation in Xen done by
Fujitsu based on Linux kernel 2.6.18.

Changes from the original version are:
- port to upstream kernel
- put all code in just one source file
- move module to appropriate location in kernel tree
- adapt to Linux style guide
- some minor code simplifications
- replace constants with defines
- remove not used defines
- add support for larger SG lists by putting them in a granted page
