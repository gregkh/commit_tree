cnic: Replace rcu_dereference() with rcu_access_pointer()

The "rcu_dereference()" calls are used directly in conditions.
Since their return values are never dereferenced it is recommended to use
"rcu_access_pointer()" instead of "rcu_dereference()".
Therefore, this patch makes the replacements.

The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used:

 while(
 (<+...
- rcu_dereference
+ rcu_access_pointer
  (...)
  ...+>)) {...}
)
