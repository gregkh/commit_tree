net/mlx4_en: Don't attempt to TX offload the outer UDP checksum for VXLAN

For VXLAN/NVGRE encapsulation, the current HW doesn't support offloading
both the outer UDP TX checksum and the inner TCP/UDP TX checksum.

The driver doesn't advertize SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL_CSUM, however we are wrongly
telling the HW to offload the outer UDP checksum for encapsulated packets,
fix that.

		     offloads of vxlan tunneling')
