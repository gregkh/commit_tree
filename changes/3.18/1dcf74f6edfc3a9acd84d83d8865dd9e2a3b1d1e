x86_64, entry: Use split-phase syscall_trace_enter for 64-bit syscalls

On KVM on my box, this reduces the overhead from an always-accept
seccomp filter from ~130ns to ~17ns.  Most of that comes from
avoiding IRET on every syscall when seccomp is enabled.

In extremely approximate hacked-up benchmarking, just bypassing IRET
saves about 80ns, so there's another 43ns of savings here from
simplifying the seccomp path.

The diffstat is also rather nice :)
