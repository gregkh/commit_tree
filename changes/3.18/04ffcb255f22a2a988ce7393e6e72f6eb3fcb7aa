net: Add ndo_gso_check

Add ndo_gso_check which a device can define to indicate whether is
is capable of doing GSO on a packet. This funciton would be called from
the stack to determine whether software GSO is needed to be done. A
driver should populate this function if it advertises GSO types for
which there are combinations that it wouldn't be able to handle. For
instance a device that performs UDP tunneling might only implement
support for transparent Ethernet bridging type of inner packets
or might have limitations on lengths of inner headers.
