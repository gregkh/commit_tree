x86: Add more disabled features

The original motivation for these patches was for an Intel CPU
feature called MPX.  The patch to add a disabled feature for it
will go in with the other parts of the support.

But, in the meantime, there are a few other features than MPX
that we can make assumptions about at compile-time based on
compile options.  Add them to disabled-features.h and check them
with cpu_feature_enabled().

Note that this gets rid of the last things that needed an #ifdef
CONFIG_X86_64 in cpufeature.h.  Yay!
