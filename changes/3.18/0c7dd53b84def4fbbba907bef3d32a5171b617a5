drm/i915/bdw: Add a context and an engine pointers to the ringbuffer

Any given ringbuffer is unequivocally tied to one context and one engine.
By setting the appropriate pointers to them, the ringbuffer struct holds
all the infromation you might need to submit a workload for processing,
Execlists style.

v2: Drop ring->ctx since that looks terribly ill-defined for legacy
ringbuffer submission.
