compiler/gcc4+: Remove inaccurate comment about 'asm goto' miscompiles

The bug referenced by the comment in this commit was not
completely fixed in GCC 4.8.2, as I mentioned in a thread back
in February:

   https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/2/12/797

The conclusion at that time was to make the quirk unconditional
until the bug could be found and fixed in GCC. Unfortunately,
when I submitted the patch (commit a9f18034) I left a comment
in that claimed the bug was fixed in GCC 4.8.2+.

This comment is inaccurate, and should be removed.
