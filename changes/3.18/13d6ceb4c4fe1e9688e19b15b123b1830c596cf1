tty: omap-serial: pull out calculation from baud_is_mode16

To determine the correct divisor, we need to know the difference between
the desired baud rate and the actual baud rate. The calculation for this
difference is implemented twice within omap_serial_baud_is_mode16().
Pull out the calculation for easier maintenance.

While at it, remove the CamelCasing from the variable names.
