x86/xen: Set EFER.NX and EFER.SCE in PVH guests

This fixes two bugs in PVH guests:

  - Not setting EFER.NX means the NX bit in page table entries is
    ignored on Intel processors and causes reserved bit page faults on
    AMD processors.

  - After the Xen commit 7645640d6ff1 ("x86/PVH: don't set EFER_SCE for
    pvh guest") PVH guests are required to set EFER.SCE to enable the
    SYSCALL instruction.

Secondary VCPUs are started with pagetables with the NX bit set so
EFER.NX must be set before using any stack or data segment.
xen_pvh_cpu_early_init() is the new secondary VCPU entry point that
sets EFER before jumping to cpu_bringup_and_idle().
