KVM: x86: Decoding guest instructions which cross page boundary may fail

Once an instruction crosses a page boundary, the size read from the second page
disregards the common case that part of the operand resides on the first page.
As a result, fetch of long insturctions may fail, and thereby cause the
decoding to fail as well.
