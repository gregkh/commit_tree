UBI: Fix livelock in produce_free_peb()

The while loop in produce_free_peb() assumes that each work will produce a
free PEB. This is not true.
If ubi->works_count is 1 and the only scheduled work is the
wear_leveling_worker() produce_free_peb() can loop forever in case
nobody schedules an erase work.
Fix this issue by checking in the while loop whether work is scheduled.
