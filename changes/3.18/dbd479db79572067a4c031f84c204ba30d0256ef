net: bcmgenet: apply MII configuration in bcmgenet_open()

In case an interface has been brought down before entering S3, and then
brought up out of S3, all the initialization done during
bcmgenet_probe() by bcmgenet_mii_init() calling bcmgenet_mii_config() is
just lost since register contents are restored to their reset values.

Re-apply this configuration anytime we call bcmgenet_open() to make sure
our port multiplexer is properly configured to match the PHY interface.

Since we are now calling bcmgenet_mii_config() everytime bcmgenet_open()
is called, make sure we only print the message during initialization
time not to pollute the console.
