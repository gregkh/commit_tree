staging: comedi: me_daq: fix bug in me_ao_insn_write()

The comedi core expects (*insn_write) functions to write insn->n values
to the hardware and return the number of values written.

Currently, this function only writes the first value. The core also
validates all the data values so the extra masking with s->maxdata is
not needed. Fix this function to work like the core expects.
