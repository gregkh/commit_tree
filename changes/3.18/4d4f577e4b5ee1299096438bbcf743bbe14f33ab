powerpc/eeh: Fix improper condition in eeh_pci_enable()

The function eeh_pci_enable() is called to apply various requests
to one particular PE: Enabling EEH, Disabling EEH, Enabling IO,
Enabling DMA, Freezing PE. When enabling IO or DMA on one specific
PE, we need check that IO or DMA isn't enabled previously. But
the condition used to do the check isn't completely correct because
one PE would be in DMA frozen state with workable IO path, or vice
versa.

The patch fixes the improper condition.
