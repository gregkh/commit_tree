usb: Add LED triggers for USB activity

With this patch, USB activity can be signaled by blinking a LED. There
are two triggers, one for activity on USB host and one for USB gadget.

Both triggers should work with all host/device controllers. Tested only
with musb.

Performace: I measured performance overheads on ARM Cortex-A8 (TI
AM335x) running on 600 MHz.

Duration of usb_led_activity():
- with no LED attached to the trigger:        2 ± 1 µs
- with one GPIO LED attached to the trigger:  2 ± 1 µs or 8 ± 2 µs (two peaks in histogram)

Duration of functions calling usb_led_activity() (with this patch
applied and no LED attached to the trigger):
- __usb_hcd_giveback_urb():    10 - 25 µs
- usb_gadget_giveback_request(): 2 - 6 µs
