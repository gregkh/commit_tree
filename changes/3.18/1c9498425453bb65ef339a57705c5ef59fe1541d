drm/radeon: add locking around atombios scratch space usage

While developing MST support I noticed I often got the wrong data
back from a transaction, in a racy fashion. I noticed the scratch
space wasn't locked against concurrent users.

Based on a patch by Alex, but I've made it a bit more obvious when
things are locked.
