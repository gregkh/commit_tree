staging: unisys: uislib: uislib.c: sparse warning of context imbalance

fixed sparse warning : context imbalance in 'destroy_device'
                        unexpected unlock
this patch will generate warning from checkpatch for
lines over 80 character , but since those are user-visible strings
so it was not modified.
