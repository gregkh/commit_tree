ext4: call ext4_ext_drop_refs() from ext4_ext_find_extent()

In nearly all of the calls to ext4_ext_find_extent() where the caller
is trying to recycle the path object, ext4_ext_drop_refs() gets called
to release the buffer heads before the path object gets overwritten.
To simplify things for the callers, and to avoid the possibility of a
memory leak, make ext4_ext_find_extent() responsible for dropping the
buffers.
