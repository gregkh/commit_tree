blkcg: remove blkcg->id

blkcg->id is a unique id given to each blkcg; however, the
cgroup_subsys_state which each blkcg embeds already has ->serial_nr
which can be used for the same purpose.  Drop blkcg->id and replace
its uses with blkcg->css.serial_nr.  Rename cfq_cgroup->blkcg_id to
->blkcg_serial_nr and @id in check_blkcg_changed() to @serial_nr for
consistency.
