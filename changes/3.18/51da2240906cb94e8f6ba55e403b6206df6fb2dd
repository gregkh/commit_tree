mmc: dw_mmc: use mmc_regulator_get_supply to handle regulators

This patch makes use of mmc_regulator_get_supply() to handle
the vmmc and vqmmc regulators.Also it moves the code handling
the these regulators to dw_mci_set_ios().It turned on the vmmc
and vqmmc during MMC_POWER_UP and MMC_POWER_ON,and turned off
during MMC_POWER_OFF.
