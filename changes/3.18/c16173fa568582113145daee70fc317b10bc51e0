arm64/efi: efistub: cover entire static mem footprint in PE/COFF .text

The static memory footprint of a kernel Image at boot is larger than the
Image file itself. Things like .bss data and initial page tables are allocated
statically but populated dynamically so their content is not contained in the
Image file.

However, if EFI (or GRUB) has loaded the Image at precisely the desired offset
of base of DRAM + TEXT_OFFSET, the Image will be booted in place, and we have
to make sure that the allocation done by the PE/COFF loader is large enough.

Fix this by growing the PE/COFF .text section to cover the entire static
memory footprint. The part of the section that is not covered by the payload
will be zero initialised by the PE/COFF loader.
