Revert "usb: gadget: composite: dequeue cdev->req before free it in composite_dev_cleanup"

This reverts commit f2267089ea17fa97b796b1b4247e3f8957655df3.

That commit causes more problem than fixes. Firstly, kfree()
should be called after usb_ep_dequeue() and secondly, the way
things are, we will try to dequeue a request that has already
completed much more frequently than one which is pending.
