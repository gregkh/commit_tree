eeepc-laptop: change sysfs function names to API expectations

The eeepc-laptop driver follows the function naming convention
<action>_<attrname>(), while the sysfs macros are built around the
convention <attrname>_<action>(). Rename the sysfs functions to the
convention used by sysfs. This makes it easier to use the available API
later on.
