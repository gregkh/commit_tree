Input: psmouse - add support for detecting FocalTech PS/2 touchpads

The Asus X450 and X550 laptops use a PS/2 touchpad from a new
manufacturer called FocalTech:

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1110011

The protocol for these devices is not known at this time, but even
without knowing the protocol they need some special handling. They get
upset by some of our other PS/2 device probing, and once upset generate
random mouse events making things unusable even with an external mouse.

This patch adds detection of these devices based on their pnp ids, and
when they are detected, treats them as a bare ps/2 mouse. Doing things
this way they at least work in their ps/2 mouse emulation mode.
