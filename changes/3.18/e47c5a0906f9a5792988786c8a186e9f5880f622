usb: host: ehci-st: Add EHCI support for ST STB devices

This patch adds the glue code required to ensure the on-chip EHCI
controller works on STi consumer electronics SoC's from STMicroelectronics.

It mainly manages the setting and enabling of the relevant clocks and manages
the reset / power signals to the IP block.
