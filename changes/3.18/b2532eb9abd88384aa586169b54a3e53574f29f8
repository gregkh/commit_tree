tcp: fix ooo_okay setting vs Small Queues

TCP Small Queues (tcp_tsq_handler()) can hold one reference on
sk->sk_wmem_alloc, preventing skb->ooo_okay being set.

We should relax test done to set skb->ooo_okay to take care
of this extra reference.

Minimal truesize of skb containing one byte of payload is
SKB_TRUESIZE(1)

Without this fix, we have more chance locking flows into the wrong
transmit queue.
