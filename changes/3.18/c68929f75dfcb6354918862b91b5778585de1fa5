USB: quirks: enable device-qualifier quirk for Elan Touchscreen

Enable device-qualifier quirk for Elan Touchscreen, which often fails to
handle requests for the device_descriptor.

Note that the device sometimes do respond properly with a Request Error
(three times as USB core retries), but usually fails to respond at all.
When this happens any further descriptor requests also fails, for
example:

[ 1528.688934] usb 2-7: new full-speed USB device number 4 using xhci_hcd
[ 1530.945588] usb 2-7: unable to read config index 0 descriptor/start: -71
[ 1530.945592] usb 2-7: can't read configurations, error -71

This has been observed repeating for over a minute before eventual
successful enumeration.
