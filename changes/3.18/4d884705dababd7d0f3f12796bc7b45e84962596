drm/i915: Track file_priv, not ctx in the ppgtt structure

Hardware contexts reference a ppgtt, not the other way round. And the
only user of this (in debugfs) actually only cares about which file
the ppgtt is associated with. So give it what it wants.

While at it give the ppgtt create function a proper name&place.
