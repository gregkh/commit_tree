drm/i915/bdw: Two-stage execlist submit process

Context switch (and execlist submission) should happen only when
other contexts are not active, otherwise pre-emption occurs.

To assure this, we place context switch requests in a queue and those
request are later consumed when the right context switch interrupt is
received (still TODO).

v2: Use a spinlock, do not remove the requests on unqueue (wait for
context switch completion).

v3: Several rebases and code changes. Use unique ID.

v4:
- Move the queue/lock init to the late ring initialization.
- Damien's kmalloc review comments: check return, use sizeof(*req),
do not cast.

v5:
- Do not reuse drm_i915_gem_request. Instead, create our own.
- New namespace.
