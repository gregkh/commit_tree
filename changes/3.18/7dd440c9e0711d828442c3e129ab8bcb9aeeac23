rbd: do not return -ERANGE on auth failures

Trying to map an image out of a pool for which we don't have an 'x'
permission bit fails with -ERANGE from ceph_extract_encoded_string()
due to an unsigned vs signed bug.  Fix it and get rid of the -EINVAL
sink, thus propagating rbd::get_id cls method errors.  (I've seen
a bunch of unexplained -ERANGE reports, I bet this is it).
