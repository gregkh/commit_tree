perf tools: Disable kernel symbol demangling by default

Some Linux symbols (for example __vt_event_wait) are interpreted by the
demangler as C++ mangled names, which of course they aren't.

Disable kernel symbol demangling by default to avoid this, and allow
enabling it with a new option --demangle-kernel for those who wish it.
