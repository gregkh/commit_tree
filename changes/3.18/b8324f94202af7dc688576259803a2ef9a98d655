isdn/gigaset: fix non-heap pointer deallocation

at_state structures may be allocated individually or as part of a
cardstate or bc_state structure. The disconnect() function handled
both cases, creating a risk that it might try to deallocate an
at_state structure that had not been allocated individually.
Fix by splitting disconnect() into two variants handling cases
with and without an associated B channel separately, and adding
an explicit check.

Spotted with Coverity.
