ASoC: Move debugfs registration to the component level

The debugfs registration is mostly identical between platforms and CODECs. This
patches consolidates the two implementations at the component level.

Unfortunately there are still a couple of CODEC specific debugfs files that are
related to legacy ASoC IO that need to be registered. For this a new callback is
added to the component struct that will be initialized when a CODEC is
registered and will be used to register the CODEC specific files. Once there are
no drivers left using legacy IO this can be removed again.
