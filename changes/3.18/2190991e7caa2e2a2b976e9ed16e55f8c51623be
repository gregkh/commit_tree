KVM: PPC: BOOKE: Clear guest dbsr in userspace exit KVM_EXIT_DEBUG

Dbsr is not visible to userspace and we do not think any need to
expose this to userspace because:
  Userspace cannot inject debug interrupt to guest (as this
  does not know guest ability to handle debug interrupt), so
  userspace will always clear DBSR.
  Now if userspace has to always clear DBSR in KVM_EXIT_DEBUG
  handling then clearing dbsr in kernel looks simple as this
  avoid doing SET_SREGS/set_one_reg() to clear DBSR
