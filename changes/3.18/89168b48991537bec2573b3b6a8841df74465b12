mmc: core: restore detect line inversion semantics

commit 98e90de99a0c43bd434da814c882c4332441871e
"mmc: host: switch OF parser to use gpio descriptors"
switched the semantic behaviour of card detect and read
only flags such that the inversion capability flag would
only be set if inversion was explicitly specified in the
device tree, in the hopes that no-one was using double
inversion.

It turns out that the XOR:ing between the explicit
inversion was indeed in use, so we need to restore the
old semantics where both ways of inversion are checked
and the end result XOR:ed.
