ALSA: hda - Get rid of action field from struct hda_jack_tbl

The action value assigned to each hda_jack_tbl entry is mostly
superfluous.  The actually used values are either the widget NID or a
value specific to the callback.

The former case can be simply replaced by a reference to widget NID
itself.  The only place doing the latter is STAC/IDT codec driver for
the powermap handling.  But, the code doesn't need to check the action
field at all -- the function jack_update_power() is called either with
a specific pin or with NULL.  So the check of jack->action can be
removed completely there, too.
