x86: Support compiling out human-friendly processor feature names

The table mapping CPUID bits to human-readable strings takes up a
non-trivial amount of space, and only exists to support /proc/cpuinfo
and a couple of kernel messages.  Since programs depend on the format of
/proc/cpuinfo, force inclusion of the table when building with /proc
support; otherwise, support omitting that table to save space, in which
case the kernel messages will print features numerically instead.

In addition to saving 1408 bytes out of vmlinux, this also saves 1373
bytes out of the uncompressed setup code, which contributes directly to
the size of bzImage.
