sched: print_rq(): Don't use tasklist_lock

read_lock_irqsave(tasklist_lock) in print_rq() looks strange. We do
not need to disable irqs, and they are already disabled by the caller.

And afaics this lock buys nothing, we can rely on rcu_read_lock().
In this case it makes sense to also move rcu_read_lock/unlock from
the caller to print_rq().
