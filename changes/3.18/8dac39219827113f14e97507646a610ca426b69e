xfs: kill xfs_bdstrat_cb

Only has two callers, and is just a shutdown check and error handler
around xfs_buf_iorequest. However, the error handling is a mess of
read and write semantics, and both internal callers only call it for
writes. Hence kill the wrapper, and follow up with a patch to
sanitise the error handling.
