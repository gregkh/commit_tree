fat: fix oops on corrupted vfat fs

a) don't bother with ->d_time for positives - we only check it for
   negatives anyway.

b) make sure to set it at unlink and rmdir time - at *that* point
   soon-to-be negative dentry matches then-current directory contents

c) don't go into renaming of old alias in vfat_lookup() unless it
   has the same parent (which it will, unless we are seeing corrupted
   image)
