nohz: Move nohz full init call to tick init

This way we unbloat a bit main.c and more importantly we initialize
nohz full after init_IRQ(). This dependency will be needed in further
patches because nohz full needs irq work to raise its own IRQ.
Information about the support for this ability on ARM64 is obtained on
init_IRQ() which initialize the pointer to __smp_call_function.

Since tick_init() is called right after init_IRQ(), this is a good place
to call tick_nohz_init() and prepare for that dependency.
