xfs: add debug sysfs attribute set

Create a top-level debug directory for global debug sysfs attributes.
This directory is added and removed on XFS module initialization and
removal respectively for DEBUG mode kernels only. It typically resides
at /sys/fs/xfs/debug. It is located at the top level of the xfs sysfs
hierarchy as attributes might define global behavior or behavior that
must be configured before an xfs mount is available (e.g., log recovery
behavior).

Define the global debug kobject that represents the debug sysfs
directory and add generic attribute show/store helpers to support future
attributes. No debug attributes are exported as of yet.
