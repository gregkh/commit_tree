block: disable entropy contributions for nonrot devices

Clear QUEUE_FLAG_ADD_RANDOM in all block drivers that set
QUEUE_FLAG_NONROT.

Historically, all block devices have automatically made entropy
contributions.  But as previously stated in commit e2e1a148 ("block: add
sysfs knob for turning off disk entropy contributions"):
    - On SSD disks, the completion times aren't as random as they
      are for rotational drives. So it's questionable whether they
      should contribute to the random pool in the first place.
    - Calling add_disk_randomness() has a lot of overhead.

There are more reliable sources for randomness than non-rotational block
devices.  From a security perspective it is better to err on the side of
caution than to allow entropy contributions from unreliable "random"
sources.
