Documentation: arm: define DT idle states bindings

ARM based platforms implement a variety of power management schemes that
allow processors to enter idle states at run-time.
The parameters defining these idle states vary on a per-platform basis forcing
the OS to hardcode the state parameters in platform specific static tables
whose size grows as the number of platforms supported in the kernel increases
and hampers device drivers standardization.

Therefore, this patch aims at standardizing idle state device tree bindings
for ARM platforms. Bindings define idle state parameters inclusive of entry
methods and state latencies, to allow operating systems to retrieve the
configuration entries from the device tree and initialize the related power
management drivers, paving the way for common code in the kernel to deal with
idle states and removing the need for static data in current and previous
kernel versions.

ARM64 platforms require the DT to define an entry-method property
for idle states.

On system implementing PSCI as an enable-method to enter low-power
states the PSCI CPU suspend method requires the power_state parameter to
be passed to the PSCI CPU suspend function.

This parameter is specific to a power state and platform specific,
therefore must be provided by firmware to the OS in order to enable
proper call sequence.

Thus, this patch also adds a property in the PSCI bindings that
describes how the PSCI CPU suspend power_state parameter should be
defined in DT in all device nodes that rely on PSCI CPU suspend method usage.
