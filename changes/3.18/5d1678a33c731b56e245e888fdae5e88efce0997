USB: keyspan: fix tty line-status reporting

Fix handling of TTY error flags, which are not bitmasks and must
specifically not be ORed together as this prevents the line discipline
from recognising them.

Also insert null characters when reporting overrun errors as these are
not associated with the received character.
