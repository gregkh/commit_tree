staging: comedi: das08: fix bug in das08_ao_winsn()

The comedi core expects (*insn_write) functions to write insn->n values
to the hardware and return the number of values written.

Currently, this function only writes the first value. Fix it to work
like the core expects.

For aesthetics, rename the function and tidy it up a bit.
