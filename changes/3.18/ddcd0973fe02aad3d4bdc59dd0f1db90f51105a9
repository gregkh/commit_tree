perf/x86/uncore: Rename IvyTown to IvyBridge-EP

Keeping track of all the various CPU names is hard enough; adding extra
silly names for no reason is just not helping. If we know the base arch
name (IvyBridge) then we can do the client/server parts with the well
known {,EP,EX} postfixes, no need to remember endless amounts of
unrelated and pointless names for this.
