perf/x86/intel/uncore: Register the PMU only if the uncore pci device exists

Current code registers PMUs for all possible uncore pci devices.
This is not good because, on some machines, one or more uncore pci
devices can be missing. The missing pci device make corresponding
PMU unusable. Register the PMU only if the uncore device exists.
