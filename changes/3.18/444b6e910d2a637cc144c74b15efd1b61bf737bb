nfsd: fix nfsd4_cb_recall_done error handling

For any error that is not EBADHANDLE or NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID,
nfsd4_cb_recall_done first marks the connection down, then
retries until dl_retries hits zero, then marks the connection down
again and sets cb_done.  This changes the code to only retry
for EBADHANDLE or NFS4ERR_BAD_STATEID, and factors setting
cb_done into a single point in the function.
