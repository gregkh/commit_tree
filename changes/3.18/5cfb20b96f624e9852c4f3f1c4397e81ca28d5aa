powerpc/eeh: Emulate EEH recovery for VFIO devices

When enabling EEH functionality on passed through devices (PE)
with VFIO, the devices in the PE would be removed permanently
from guest side. In that case, the PE remains frozen state.
When returning PE to host, or restarting the guest again, we
had mechanism unfreezing the PE by clearing PESTA/B frozen
bits. However, that's not enough for some adapters, which are
indicated as following "lspci" shows. Those adapters require
hot reset on the parent bus to bring their firmware back to
workable state. Otherwise, those adaptrs won't be operative
and the host (for returning case) or the guest will fail to
load the drivers for those adapters without exception.

             10Gb NIC (be3) (rev 02)
0000:01:00.0 0200: 19a2:0710 (rev 02)
0001:03:00.0 Ethernet controller: Emulex Corporation OneConnect \
             NIC (Lancer) (rev 10)
0001:03:00.0 0200: 10df:e220 (rev 10)

The patch adds mechanism to emulate EEH recovery (for hot reset
on parent PCI bus) on 3 gates to fix the issue: open/release one
adapter of the PE, enable EEH functionality on one adapter of the
PE.
