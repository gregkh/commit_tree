staging: comedi: cb_pcidas64: tidy up dio_callback_4020()

The 8255 driver (*io) callback now includes the comedi_device pointer.
Using this we can get the ioremap'ed base address.

Instead of passing the (cast) mmio address to subdev_8255_init(), pass
the 'iobase' of the 8255 registers (I8255_4020_REG).
