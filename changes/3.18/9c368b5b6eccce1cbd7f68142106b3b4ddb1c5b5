sched, time: Fix lock inversion in thread_group_cputime()

The sig->stats_lock nests inside the tasklist_lock and the
sighand->siglock in __exit_signal and wait_task_zombie.

However, both of those locks can be taken from irq context,
which means we need to use the interrupt safe variant of
read_seqbegin_or_lock. This blocks interrupts when the "lock"
branch is taken (seq is odd), preventing the lock inversion.

On the first (lockless) pass through the loop, irqs are not
blocked.
