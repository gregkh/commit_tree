Bluetooth: Fix re-setting RPA as expired when deferring update

The hci_update_random_address will clear the RPA_EXPIRED flag and
proceed with setting a new one if the flag was set. However, the
set_random_addr() function that is called may choose to defer the update
to a later moment. In such a case the flag would incorrectly remain
unset unless set_random_addr() re-sets it. This patch fixes the issue.
