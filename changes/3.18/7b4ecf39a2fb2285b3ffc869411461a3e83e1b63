net: fs_enet: error: 'SCCE_ENET_TXF' undeclared

[linux-devel:devel-hourly-2014100909 3763/3915] drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fs_enet/mac-scc.c:119:32: error: 'SCCE_ENET_TXF' undeclared

Due to patch d43a396 net: fs_enet: Add NAPI TX, it appears that some target
compilations are broken.
This is due to the fact that unlike the FEC, the SCC and FCC don't have a TXF
event (complete Frame transmitted) but only TXB (buffer transmitted).
