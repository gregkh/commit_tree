mfd: stmpe: Support gpio over irq under device tree

The stmpe_platform_data has a irq_over_gpio field, which allows the
system to read STMPE events whenever an IRQ occurs on a GPIO pin.
This patch adds the ability to configure this field and to use a GPIO
as an IRQ source for boards configuring the STMPE in device tree.
