ACPICA: Events: Update GPE handler removal, match behavior of handler install.

The originally_enabled check is not paired between
acpi_install_gpe_handler() and acpi_remove_gpe_handler().

In ACPICA upstream, there is code to protect original enabled state for
ACPI_GPE_DISPATCH_NOTIFY and this commit fixes an issue for this feature.
