iwlwifi: mvm: clear d0i3 state on recovery

If recovery happened after mvm entered d0i3 (e.g.
due to sysassert when releasing the bus), the
mvm->state wasn't cleared properly, causing the
ongoing recovery to fail (due to iwl_mvm_ref_sync
failure).

This in turn fails the ongoing recovery, and triggers
a reprobe, which terminates any ongoing wifi activity.
