ARM: mvebu: update v7 defconfig with useful options

Turn on a bunch of options to make my cubox bootable/usable:

PRINTK_TIME
EXT4 (and turn off 2/3 since 4 can mount all filesystems)
MV643XX_ETH for Dove
SDHCI for Dove
DEVTMPFS
PACKET and UNIX protocol support

Much of the other churn is just due to reorderings in the defconfig
