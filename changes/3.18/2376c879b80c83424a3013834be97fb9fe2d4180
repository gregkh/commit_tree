cxgb4 : Improve handling of DCB negotiation or loss thereof

Clear out any DCB apps we might have added to kernel table when we lose DCB
sync (or IEEE equivalent event). These were previously left behind and not
cleaned up correctly. IEEE allows individual components to work independently,
 so improve check for IEEE completion by specifying individual components.
