vfs: factor out lookup_mountpoint from new_mountpoint

I am shortly going to add a new user of struct mountpoint that
needs to look up existing entries but does not want to create
a struct mountpoint if one does not exist.  Therefore to keep
the code simple and easy to read split out lookup_mountpoint
from new_mountpoint.
