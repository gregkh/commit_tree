ftrace: Set ops->old_hash on modifying what an ops hooks to

The code that checks for trampolines when modifying function hooks
tests against a modified ops "old_hash". But the ops old_hash pointer
is not being updated before the changes are made, making it possible
to not find the right hash to the callback and possibly causing
ftrace to break in accounting and disable itself.

Have the ops set its old_hash before the modifying takes place.
