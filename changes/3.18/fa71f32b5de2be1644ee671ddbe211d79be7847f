HID: uhid: add ABI compatible UHID_GET_REPORT replacing UHID_FEATURE

The old hdev->hid_get_raw_report() was broken by design. It was never
clear what kind of HW request it should trigger. Benjamin fixed that with
the core HID cleanup, though we never really adjusted uhid.

Unfortunately, our old UHID_FEATURE command was modelled around the broken
hid_get_raw_report(). We converted it silently to the new GET_REPORT and
nothing broke. Make this explicit by renaming UHID_FEATURE to
UHID_GET_REPORT and UHID_FEATURE_ANSWER to UHID_GET_REPORT_REPLY.

Note that this is 100% ABI compatible to UHID_FEATURE. This is just a
rename. But we have to keep the old definitions around to not break API.

>From now on, UHID_GET_REPORT must trigger a GET_REPORT request on the
user-space hardware layer. All the ambiguity due to the weird "feature"
name should be gone now.
