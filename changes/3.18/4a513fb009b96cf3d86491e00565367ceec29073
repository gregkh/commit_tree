arm64: kvm: define PAGE_S2_DEVICE as read-only by default

Now that we support read-only memslots, we need to make sure that
pass-through device mappings are not mapped writable if the guest
has requested them to be read-only. The existing implementation
already honours this by calling kvm_set_s2pte_writable() on the new
pte in case of writable mappings, so all we need to do is define
the default pgprot_t value used for devices to be PTE_S2_RDONLY.
