block: introduce blk_init_flush and its pair

These two temporary functions are introduced for holding flush
initialization and de-initialization, so that we can
introduce 'flush queue' easier in the following patch. And
once 'flush queue' and its allocation/free functions are ready,
they will be removed for sake of code readability.
