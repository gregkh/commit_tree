arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: Clear queued flags on unqueue

If we unqueue a level-triggered interrupt completely, and the LR does
not stick around in the active state (and will therefore no longer
generate a maintenance interrupt), then we should clear the queued flag
so that the vgic can actually queue this level-triggered interrupt at a
later time and deal with its pending state then.

Note: This should actually be properly fixed to handle the active state
on the distributor.
