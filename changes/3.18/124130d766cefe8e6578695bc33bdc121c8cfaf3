ath9k: Clear offchannel duration properly

Clearing the offchannel duration value in the
scheduler unconditionally breaks NoA when
multiple contexts are active and an offchannel
request is deferred, for example, in a scan run.

Fix this by clearing the duration only if there
is no pending offchannel request.
