Bluetooth: LLVMLinux: Remove VLAIS from bluetooth/amp.c

Replaced the use of a Variable Length Array In Struct (VLAIS) with a C99
compliant equivalent. This patch allocates the appropriate amount of memory
using an char array.

The new code can be compiled with both gcc and clang.

struct shash_desc contains a flexible array member member ctx declared with
CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR, so sizeof(struct shash_desc) aligns the beginning
of the array declared after struct shash_desc with long long.

No trailing padding is required because it is not a struct type that can
be used in an array.

The CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR is required so that desc is aligned with long long
as would be the case for a struct containing a member with
CRYPTO_MINALIGN_ATTR.
