netfilter: nft_compat: remove incomplete 32/64 bits arch compat code

This code was based on the wrong asumption that you can probe based
on the match/target private size that we get from userspace. This
doesn't work at all when you have to dump the info back to userspace
since you don't know what word size the userspace utility is using.

Currently, the extensions that require arch compat are limit match
and the ebt_mark match/target. The standard targets are not used by
the nft-xt compat layer, so they are not affected. We can work around
this limitation with a new revision that uses arch agnostic types.
