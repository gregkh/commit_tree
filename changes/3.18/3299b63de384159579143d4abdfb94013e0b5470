drivers: cpuidle: CPU idle ARM64 driver

This patch implements a generic CPU idle driver for ARM64 machines.

It relies on the DT idle states infrastructure to initialize idle
states count and respective parameters. Current code assumes the driver
is managing idle states on all possible CPUs but can be easily
generalized to support heterogenous systems and build cpumasks at
runtime using MIDRs or DT cpu nodes compatible properties.

The driver relies on the arm64 CPU operations to call the idle
initialization hook used to parse and save suspend back-end specific
idle states information upon probing.

Idle state index 0 is always initialized as a simple wfi state, ie always
considered present and functional on all ARM64 platforms.

Idle state indices higher than 0 trigger idle state entry by calling
the cpu_suspend function, that triggers the suspend operation through
the CPU operations suspend back-end hook. cpu_suspend passes the idle
state index as a parameter so that the CPU operations suspend back-end
can retrieve the required idle state data by using the idle state
index to execute a look-up on its internal data structures.
