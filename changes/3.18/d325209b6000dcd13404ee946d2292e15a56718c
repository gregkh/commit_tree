locking,arch,avr32: Fold atomic_ops

Many of the atomic op implementations are the same except for one
instruction; fold the lot into a few CPP macros and reduce LoC.

This also prepares for easy addition of new ops.

Requires the asm_op because of eor.

AVR32 is a bit special in that its ADD/SUB instructions are not
symmetric. Its SUB instruction allows for an 21bit immediate.
