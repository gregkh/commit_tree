staging: unisys: remove timskmodutils.h

Remove the entire timskmodutils.h file as it had a lot of checkpatch.pl
strict warnings and checks, and nearly all of the functions were not used
anywhere.

The unisys_spar_platform variable was moved to timskmod.h. References to the
removed timskmodutils.h were switched to timskmod.h instead. The unused
visor_seq_file_new_buffer() and visor_seq_file_done_buffer() functions defined
in timskmodutils.h were implemented in visorkmodutils.c, so these were removed
as well.

This patch will generate a warning about updating MAINTAINERS, but there does
not seem to be any need for that.
