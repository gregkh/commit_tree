dm bufio: change __GFP_IO to __GFP_FS in shrinker callbacks

The shrinker uses gfp flags to indicate what kind of operation can the
driver wait for. If __GFP_IO flag is present, the driver can wait for
block I/O operations, if __GFP_FS flag is present, the driver can wait on
operations involving the filesystem.

dm-bufio tested for __GFP_IO. However, dm-bufio can run on a loop block
device that makes calls into the filesystem. If __GFP_IO is present and
__GFP_FS isn't, dm-bufio could still block on filesystem operations if it
runs on a loop block device.

The change from __GFP_IO to __GFP_FS supposedly fixes one observed (though
unreproducible) deadlock involving dm-bufio and loop device.
