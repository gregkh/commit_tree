memory-hotplug: add sysfs valid_zones attribute

Currently memory-hotplug has two limits:

1. If the memory block is in ZONE_NORMAL, you can change it to
   ZONE_MOVABLE, but this memory block must be adjacent to ZONE_MOVABLE.

2. If the memory block is in ZONE_MOVABLE, you can change it to
   ZONE_NORMAL, but this memory block must be adjacent to ZONE_NORMAL.

With this patch, we can easy to know a memory block can be onlined to
which zone, and don't need to know the above two limits.

Updated the related Documentation.
