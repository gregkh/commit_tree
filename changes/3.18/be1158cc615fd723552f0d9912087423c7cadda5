jbd2: fold __process_buffer() into jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()

__process_buffer() is only called by jbd2_log_do_checkpoint(), and it
had a very complex locking protocol where it would be called with the
j_list_lock, and sometimes exit with the lock held (if the return code
was 0), or release the lock.

This was confusing both to humans and to smatch (which erronously
complained that the lock was taken twice).

Folding __process_buffer() to the caller allows us to simplify the
control flow, making the resulting function easier to read and reason
about, and dropping the compiled size of fs/jbd2/checkpoint.c by 150
bytes (over 4% of the text size).
