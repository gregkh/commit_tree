fnic: assign FIP_ALL_FCF_MACS to fcoe_all_fcfs

1) Assgning FIP_ALL_FCF_MACS to fcoe_all_fcfs allows VLAN request to be sent
to correct Mac address for VLAN Discovery otherwise VLAN request will be
sent to invalid address hence FLOGI never happens.

2) Simplify the copy_and_format_trace_data code and log the correct Link event
for fnic control path tracing in case of link status UP->UP.

3) Increment Fnic driver version
