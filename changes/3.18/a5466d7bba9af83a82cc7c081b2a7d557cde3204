MIPS: cp1emu: Fix ISA restrictions for cop1x_op instructions

Commit 08a07904e1828 ("MIPS: math-emu: Remove most ifdefery") removed
the #ifdef ISA conditions and switched to runtime detection. However,
according to the instruction set manual, the cop1x_op instructions are
available in >=MIPS32r2 as well. This fixes a problem on MIPS32r2
with the ntpd package which failed to execute with a SIGILL exit code due
to the fact that a madd.d instruction was not being emulated.
