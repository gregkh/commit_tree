Btrfs: fix invalid leaf slot access in btrfs_lookup_extent()

If we couldn't find our extent item, we accessed the current slot
(path->slots[0]) to check if it corresponds to an equivalent skinny
metadata item. However this slot could be beyond our last item in the
leaf (i.e. path->slots[0] >= btrfs_header_nritems(leaf)), in which case
we shouldn't process it.

Since btrfs_lookup_extent() is only used to find extent items for data
extents, fix this by removing completely the logic that looks up for an
equivalent skinny metadata item, since it can not exist.
