[media] media: tuner xc5000 - try to avoid firmware load in resume path

xc5000 doesn't load firmware at attach time instead loads it
when it needs to set and change configuration from its init,
frequency, digital and analog mode set interffaces. As a result,
when system is suspended before firmware is loaded, firmware
load can be avoided during resume. Loading formware in this
scenario results in slowpath warnings during resume as it won't
be in the suspend firmware cache.
