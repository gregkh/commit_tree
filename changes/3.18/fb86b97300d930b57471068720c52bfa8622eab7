x86, microcode: Update BSPs microcode on resume

In the situation when we apply early microcode but do *not* apply late
microcode, we fail to update the BSP's microcode on resume because we
haven't initialized the uci->mc microcode pointer. So, in order to
alleviate that, we go and dig out the stashed microcode patch during
early boot. It is basically the same thing that is done on the APs early
during boot so do that too here.
