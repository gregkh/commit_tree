drm/i915/bdw: Make sure gpu reset still works with Execlists

If we reset a ring after a hang, we have to make sure that we clear
out all queued Execlists requests.

v2: The ring is, at this point, already being correctly re-programmed
for Execlists, and the hangcheck counters cleared.

v3: Daniel suggests to drop the "if (execlists)" because the Execlists
queue should be empty in legacy mode (which is true, if we do the
INIT_LIST_HEAD).

v4: Do the pending intel_runtime_pm_put
