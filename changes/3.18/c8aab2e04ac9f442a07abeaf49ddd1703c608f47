perf/x86: Clean up __intel_pmu_pebs_event() code

This patch makes the code more readable. It also renames
precise_store_data_hsw() to precise_datala_hsw() because
the function is called for both loads and stores on HSW.
The patch also gets rid of the hardcoded store events
codes in that same function.
