video: fbdev: sis: delete double assignment

Delete successive assignments to the same location.  The second assignment
is changed to update a different field, as done in other nearby code.

A simplified version of the semantic match that finds this problem is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
expression i;
@@

*i = ...;
 i = ...;
// </smpl>
