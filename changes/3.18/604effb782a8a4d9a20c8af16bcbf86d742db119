drm/i915: fix suspend/resume for GENs w/o runtime PM support

Before sharing common parts between the system and runtime s/r
handlers we WARNed if the runtime s/r handlers were called on GENs that
didn't support RPM. But this WARN is not correct if the same handler is
called from the system s/r path, since that can happen on any platform.
This also broke system s/r on old platforms.

v2:
- remove the WARN and depend on the HAS_RUNTIME_PM check in
  rutime_suspend/resume instead (Daniel)
