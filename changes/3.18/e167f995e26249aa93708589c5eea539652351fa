perf machine: Add missing dsos->root rbtree root initialization

A segfault happens on 'perf test hists_link' because we end up using a
struct machines on the stack, and then machines__init() was not
initializing the newly introduced rb_root, just the existing list_head.

When we introduced struct dsos, to group the two ways to store dsos,
i.e. the linked list and the rbtree, we didn't turned the initialization
done in:

	machines__init(machines->host) ->
		machine__init() ->
			INIT_LIST_HEAD

into a dsos__init() to keep on initializing the list_head but _as well_
initializing the rb_root, oops.

All worked because outside perf-test we probably zalloc the whole thing
which ends up initializing it in to NULL.

So the problem looks contained to 'perf test' that uses it on stack,
etc.
