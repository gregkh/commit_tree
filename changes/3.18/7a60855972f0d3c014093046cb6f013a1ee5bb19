usb: dwc3: gadget: fix set_halt() bug with pending transfers

According to our Gadget Framework API documentation,
->set_halt() *must* return -EAGAIN if we have pending
transfers (on either direction) or FIFO isn't empty (on
TX endpoints).

Fix this bug so that the mass storage gadget can be used
without stall=0 parameter.

This patch should be backported to all kernels since v3.2.
