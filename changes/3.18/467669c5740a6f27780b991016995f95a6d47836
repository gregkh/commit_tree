HID: hid-sensor-hub: re-add mistakenly removed USB_DEVICE_ID_STM_HID_SENSOR id

Adding USB_DEVICE_ID_STM_HID_SENSOR again in the quirk table. During 3.16 merge
cycle somehow quirk for device id USB_DEVICE_ID_STM_HID_SENSOR is missing.
I see commit dde3b45cd74e ("HID: hid-sensor-hub: new device id and quirk
for STM Sensor hub") added new id USB_DEVICE_ID_STM_HID_SENSOR_1,
but didn't really delete the old device id.
Anyway we need to add this back, otherwise it breaks ST sensor hubs.
