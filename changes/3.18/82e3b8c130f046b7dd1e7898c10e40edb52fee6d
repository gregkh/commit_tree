drm/i915: Localise the fbdev console lock frobbing

Rather than take and release the console_lock() around a non-existent
DRM_I915_FBDEV, move the lock acquisation into the callee where it will
be compiled out by the config option entirely. This includes moving the
deferred fb_set_suspend() dance and encapsulating it entirely within
intel_fbdev.c.

v2: Use an integral work item so that we can explicitly flush the work
upon suspend/unload.

[danvet: Add the flush_work in fbdev_fini per the mailing list
discussion. And s/BUG_ON/WARN_ON/ because.]
