tcp: use tcp_flags in tcp_data_queue()

This patch is a cleanup which follows the idea in commit e11ecddf5128 (tcp: use
TCP_SKB_CB(skb)->tcp_flags in input path),
and it may reduce register pressure since skb->cb[] access is fast,
bacause skb is probably in a register.

v2: remove variable th
v3: reword the changelog
