ext4: track extent status tree shrinker delay statictics

This commit adds some statictics in extent status tree shrinker.  The
purpose to add these is that we want to collect more details when we
encounter a stall caused by extent status tree shrinker.  Here we count
the following statictics:
  stats:
    the number of all objects on all extent status trees
    the number of reclaimable objects on lru list
    cache hits/misses
    the last sorted interval
    the number of inodes on lru list
  average:
    scan time for shrinking some objects
    the number of shrunk objects
  maximum:
    the inode that has max nr. of objects on lru list
    the maximum scan time for shrinking some objects

The output looks like below:
  $ cat /proc/fs/ext4/sda1/es_shrinker_info
  stats:
    28228 objects
    6341 reclaimable objects
    5281/631 cache hits/misses
    586 ms last sorted interval
    250 inodes on lru list
  average:
    153 us scan time
    128 shrunk objects
  maximum:
    255 inode (255 objects, 198 reclaimable)
    125723 us max scan time

If the lru list has never been sorted, the following line will not be
printed:
    586ms last sorted interval
If there is an empty lru list, the following lines also will not be
printed:
    250 inodes on lru list
  ...
  maximum:
    255 inode (255 objects, 198 reclaimable)
    0 us max scan time

Meanwhile in this commit a new trace point is defined to print some
details in __ext4_es_shrink().
