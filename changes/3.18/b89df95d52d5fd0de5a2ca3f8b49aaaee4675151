mlx4_en: Convert the normal skb free path to dev_consume_skb_any()

It would appear the mlx4_en driver was still making a call to
dev_kfree_skb_any() where dev_consume_skb_any() would be more
appropriate.  This should make dropped packet profiling/tracking
easier/better over a NIC driven by mlx4_en.
