netfilter: nft_reject: introduce icmp code abstraction for inet and bridge

This patch introduces the NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_UNREACH type which provides
an abstraction to the ICMP and ICMPv6 codes that you can use from the
inet and bridge tables, they are:

* NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_NO_ROUTE: no route to host - network unreachable
* NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_PORT_UNREACH: port unreachable
* NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_HOST_UNREACH: host unreachable
* NFT_REJECT_ICMPX_ADMIN_PROHIBITED: administratevely prohibited

You can still use the specific codes when restricting the rule to match
the corresponding layer 3 protocol.

I decided to not overload the existing NFT_REJECT_ICMP_UNREACH to have
different semantics depending on the table family and to allow the user
to specify ICMP family specific codes if they restrict it to the
corresponding family.
