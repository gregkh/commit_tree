virtio_console: move early VQ enablement

Commit f5866db6 (virtio_console: enable VQs early) tried to make
sure that DRIVER_OK was set when virtio_console started using its
virtqueues. Doing this in add_port(), however, means that we try
to set DRIVER_OK again when when a port is dynamically added after
the probe function is done.

Let's move virtio_device_ready() to the probe function just before
trying to use the virtqueues instead. This is fine as nothing can
fail inbetween.
