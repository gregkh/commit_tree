ACPICA: Events: Reduce source code difference in acpi_install_gpe_handler().

There is a sanity check in ACPICA upstream, complaining mis-matched
interrupt type for originally enabled GPEs that are going to be dispatched
by OSPM handlers. This is only a warning message noting developers such
conflict between BIOS and OSPM. This patch ports this warning message from
ACPICA upstream to reduce source code difference between Linux and ACPICA
upstream.
