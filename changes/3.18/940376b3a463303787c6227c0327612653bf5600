powerpc/eeh: Add eeh_pe_state sysfs entry

The patch adds sysfs entry "eeh_pe_state". Reading on it returns
the PE's state while writing to it clears the frozen state. It's
used to check or clear the PE frozen state from userland for
debugging purpose.

The patch also replaces printk(KERN_WARNING ...) with pr_warn() in
eeh_sysfs.c
