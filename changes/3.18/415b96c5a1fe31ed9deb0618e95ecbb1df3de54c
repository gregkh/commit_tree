nfsd: fix potential lease memory leak in nfs4_setlease

It's unlikely to ever occur, but if there were already a lease set on
the file then we could end up getting back a different pointer on a
successful setlease attempt than the one we allocated. If that happens,
the one we allocated could leak.

In practice, I don't think this will happen due to the fact that we only
try to set up the lease once per nfs4_file, but this error handling is a
bit more correct given the current lease API.
