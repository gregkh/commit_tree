arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: delay vgic allocation until init time

It is now quite easy to delay the allocation of the vgic tables
until we actually require it to be up and running (when the first
vcpu is kicking around, or someones tries to access the GIC registers).

This allow us to allocate memory for the exact number of CPUs we
have. As nobody configures the number of interrupts just yet,
use a fallback to VGIC_NR_IRQS_LEGACY.
