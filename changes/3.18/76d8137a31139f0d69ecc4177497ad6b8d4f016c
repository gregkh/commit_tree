blk-merge: recaculate segment if it isn't less than max segments

The problem is introduced by commit 764f612c6c3c231b(blk-merge:
don't compute bi_phys_segments from bi_vcnt for cloned bio),
and merge is needed if number of current segment isn't less than
max segments.

Strictly speaking, bio->bi_vcnt shouldn't be used here since
it may not be accurate in cases of both cloned bio or bio cloned
from, but bio_segments() is a bit expensive, and bi_vcnt is still
the biggest number, so the approach should work.
