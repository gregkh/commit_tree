blk-mq: fix and simplify tag iteration for the timeout handler

Don't do a kmalloc from timer to handle timeouts, chances are we could be
under heavy load or similar and thus just miss out on the timeouts.
Fortunately it is very easy to just iterate over all in use tags, and doing
this properly actually cleans up the blk_mq_busy_iter API as well, and
prepares us for the next patch by passing a reserved argument to the
iterator.
