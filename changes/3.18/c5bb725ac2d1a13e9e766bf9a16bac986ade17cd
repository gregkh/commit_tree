regulator: ltc3589: fix broken voltage transitions

VCCR is used as a trigger to start voltage transitions, so
we need to mark it volatile in order to make sure it gets
written to hardware every time we set a new voltage.

Fixes regulator voltage being stuck at the first voltage
set after driver load.
