ARM: mvebu: switch the Armada 370 RD board to internal registers at 0xf1000000

Recent bootloader versions from Marvell that have DT support and
various other new features remap the internal registers at
0xf1000000. We have already done this change for most of the
development boards from Marvell, and this commit does this change for
the Marvell Armada 370 RD board.
