i40e: Tell OS link is going down when calling set_phy_config

Since we don't seem to be getting an LSE telling us link is going down
during set_phy_config (but we do get an LSE telling us we are coming
back up), fake one for the OS and tell them link is going down. Also
do an atomic restart no matter what because there are times the user
may want to end with link up even if they started with link down (like
if they accidentally set it to a speed that can't link and are trying to
fix it).
