vfs: fix typo in s_op->alloc_inode() documentation

The function which calls s_op->alloc_inode() is not inode_alloc(), but
instead alloc_inode() which lives in fs/inode.c .

The typo was there from the beginning from 5ea626aa (VFS: update
documentation, 2005) - there was no standalone inode_alloc() for the
whole kernel history.
