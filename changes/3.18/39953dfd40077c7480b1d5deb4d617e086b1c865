rcu: Avoid misordering in __call_rcu_nocb_enqueue()

The NOCB leader wakeup ordering depends on the store to the header
happening before the check for the leader already being awake.  However,
because atomic_long_add() does not return a value, it does not provide
ordering guarantees, the incorrect comment in wake_nocb_leader()
notwithstanding.  This commit therefore adds a smp_mb__after_atomic()
after the final atomic_long_add() to provide the needed ordering
guarantee.
