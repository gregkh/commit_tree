serial: asc: Conditionally use readl_relaxed (COMPILE_TEST)

Commit 08177ece596c ("serial: asc: Adopt readl_/writel_relaxed()) is
regressing the m68k allmodconfig build. This is due to the unconditional
use of readl_relaxed() which, although documented, does not currently
exist for m68k.

This is trivially fixable for st-asc because we can just update the
asc_in() accessor to make this conditional.
