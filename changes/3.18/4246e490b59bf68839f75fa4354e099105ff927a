Staging: rtl8188eu: Removed unneeded code.

This patch removes some unneeded code.
1) kzalloc() allocates 4 extra bytes so that we can align the return
   value.  But actually the return value is already aligned so we can
   remove the + 4 and the call to N_BYTE_ALIGMENT().
2) The memset() isn't needed because kzalloc() zeroes the allocation.
