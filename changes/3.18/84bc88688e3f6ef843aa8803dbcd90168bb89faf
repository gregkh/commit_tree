inetdevice: fixed signed integer overflow

There could be a signed overflow in the following code.

The expression, (32-logmask) is comprised between 0 and 31 included.
It may be equal to 31.
In such a case the left shift will produce a signed integer overflow.
According to the C99 Standard, this is an undefined behavior.
A simple fix is to replace the signed int 1 with the unsigned int 1U.
