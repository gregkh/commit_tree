net: ppp: Don't call bpf_prog_create() in ppp_lock

In ppp_ioctl(), bpf_prog_create() is called inside ppp_lock, which
eventually calls vmalloc() and hits BUG_ON() in vmalloc.c.  This patch
works around the problem by moving the allocation outside the lock.

The bug was revealed by the recent change in net/core/filter.c, as it
allocates via vmalloc() instead of kmalloc() now.
