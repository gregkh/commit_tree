uas: Cleanup uas_log_cmd_state usage

Instead of doing:

uas_log_cmd_state(cmnd, __func__)
scmd_printk(KERN_ERR, cmnd, "error doing foo %d\n", err)

On error, resulting in 2 log calls for a single error, make uas_log_cmd_state
take a status code, and change calls like the above to:

uas_log_cmd_state(cmnd, "error doing foo", err)

Also change various sanity checks (which should never trigger) from:
"scmd_printk(KERN_ERR, cmnd, "sanity foo failed\n")" to calling the new
uas_log_cmd_state(), so that when they do trigger we get more info.
