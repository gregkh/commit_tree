checkpatch: add exception to return then else test

Add an exception to the return before else warning when the line
following it is also a return like:

	if (foo)
		return bar;
	else
		return baz;

This form of a test then return is at least as readable as

	if (foo)
		return bar;
	return baz;

so don't emit a warning on the first form.
