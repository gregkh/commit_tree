percpu_counter: add @gfp to percpu_counter_init()

Percpu allocator now supports allocation mask.  Add @gfp to
percpu_counter_init() so that !GFP_KERNEL allocation masks can be used
with percpu_counters too.

We could have left percpu_counter_init() alone and added
percpu_counter_init_gfp(); however, the number of users isn't that
high and introducing _gfp variants to all percpu data structures would
be quite ugly, so let's just do the conversion.  This is the one with
the most users.  Other percpu data structures are a lot easier to
convert.

This patch doesn't make any functional difference.
