MIPS: cpu-probe: Set the FTLB probability bit on supported cores

Make use of the Config6/FLTBP bit to set the probability of a TLBWR
instruction to hit the FTLB or the VTLB. A value of 0 (which may be
the default value on certain cores, such as proAptiv or P5600)
means that a TLBWR instruction will never hit the VTLB which
leads to performance limitations since it effectively decreases
the number of available TLB slots.
