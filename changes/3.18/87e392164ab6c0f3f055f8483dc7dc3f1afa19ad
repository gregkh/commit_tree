clk: mvebu: share locks between gate clocks

Refactor mvebu_clk_gating_setup() to use a common spinlock instead of a
unique lock for every instance of a struct clk_gating_ctrl object. This
will be used later for a separate mux clock type that shares a register
with gate clock types and needs to use the same lock to protect access
to the register.
