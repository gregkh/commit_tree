r8169:change the name of function"rtl_w1w0_eri"

Change the name of function "rtl_w1w0_eri" to "rtl_w0w1_eri".

In this function, the local variable "val" is "write zeros then write ones".
Please see below code.

(val & ~m) | p

In this patch, change the function name from "xx_w1w0_xx" to "xx_w0w1_xx".
The changed function name is more suitable for it's behavior.
