xfs: bulkstat btree walk doesn't terminate

The bulkstat code has several different ways of detecting the end of
an AG when doing a walk. They are not consistently detected, and the
code that checks for the end of AG conditions is not consistently
coded. Hence the are conditions where the walk code can get stuck in
an endless loop making no progress and not triggering any
termination conditions.

Convert all the "tmp/i" status return codes from btree operations
to a common name (stat) and apply end-of-ag detection to these
operations consistently.
