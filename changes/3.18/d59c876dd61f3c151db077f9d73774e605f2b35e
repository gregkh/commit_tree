r8152: stop submitting intr for -EPROTO

For Renesas USB 3.0 host controller, when unplugging the usb hub which
has the RTL8153 plugged, the driver would get -EPROTO for interrupt
transfer. There is high probability to get the information of "HC died;
cleaning up", if the driver continues to submit the interrupt transfer
before the disconnect() is called.
