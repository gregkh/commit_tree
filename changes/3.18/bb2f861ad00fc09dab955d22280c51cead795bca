serial: imx: fix throttle/unthrottle callbacks for hardware assisted flow control

when the 'CTSC' bit is negated. 'CTS' has no function when 'CTSC' is asserted.
0: The CTS pin is high (inactive)
1: The CTS pin is low (active)

For throttle, it needs to clear 'CTS' and 'CTSC' bits.
For unthrottle, it needs to enable 'CTS' and 'CTSC' bits.

The patch just fix the issue.
