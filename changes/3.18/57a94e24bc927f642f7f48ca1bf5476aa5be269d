mtd: nand: support ONFI timing mode retrieval for non-ONFI NANDs

Add an onfi_timing_mode_default field to nand_chip and nand_flash_dev in
order to support NAND timings definition for non-ONFI NAND.

NAND that support better timings mode than the default one have to define
a new entry in the nand_ids table.

The default timing mode should be deduced from timings description from
the datasheet and the ONFI specification
(www.onfi.org/~/media/ONFI/specs/onfi_3_1_spec.pdf, chapter 4.15
"Timing Parameters").
You should choose the closest mode that fit the timings requirements of
your NAND chip.
