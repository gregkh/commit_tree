vhost-scsi: Take configfs group dependency during VHOST_SCSI_SET_ENDPOINT

This patch addresses a bug where individual vhost-scsi configfs endpoint
groups can be removed from below while active exports to QEMU userspace
still exist, resulting in an OOPs.

It adds a configfs_depend_item() in vhost_scsi_set_endpoint() to obtain
an explicit dependency on se_tpg->tpg_group in order to prevent individual
vhost-scsi WWPN endpoints from being released via normal configfs methods
while an QEMU ioctl reference still exists.

Also, add matching configfs_undepend_item() in vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint()
to release the dependency, once QEMU's reference to the individual group
at /sys/kernel/config/target/vhost/$WWPN/$TPGT is released.

(Fix up vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint() error path - DanC)
