thermal: exynos: remove unused struct exynos_tmu_registers entries

Remove unused / write-only entries from struct exynos_tmu_registers.
Then remove unused defines while at it.

We don't keep the unused/untested features in the kernel just
in case that some future hardware might need it.  Such code has
a real maintainance cost (all other code changes have to take
the dead code into account) and usually makes future changes
more difficult, not easier (i.e. recent additions of Exynos5420
SoC and Exynos5260 SoC thermal support has not made use of any
of the driver's currently unused/untested features, moreover
the recently added code is more complex than needed because of
the existing dead code).  Also all removed dead code is still
accessible in the kernel git repository and can be easily
brought back if/when needed.

There should be no functional changes caused by this patch.
