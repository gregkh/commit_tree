PM / sleep: new suspend_resume trace event for console resume

This patch adds another suspend_resume trace event for analyze_suspend
to capture. The resume_console call can take several hundred milliseconds
if the printk buffer is full of debug info. The tool will now inform
testers of the wasted time and encourage them to disable it in
production builds.
