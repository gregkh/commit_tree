mfd: tps65910: Work around silicon erratum SWCZ010

http://www.ti.com/lit/pdf/SWCZ010:
  Glitch on SDA-SCL not managed correctly by the I2C IP

Impact:
The standard specifies that the I2C transfer should restart on a start
event in all cases. The current design does not support two consecutive
Start conditions. This can cause the first real access after such a
glitch to be corrupted.

Description:
An unexpected glitch on SDA and SCL can generate a wrong start event.
In the current design, the SCL line must toggle two times to detect a
new start event and completely restart the I2C access; hence the real
start event is not detected in the case of a single SCL toggle.

Workaround:
Repeat I2C access.

A simpler workaround is to make a dummy transfer just before the first
access to the tps65910 chip. This can be done unconditionally.
