phy: omap-usb2: Enable runtime PM of omap-usb2 phy properly

The USB OTG port does not work since v3.16 on omap platform.
This is a regression introduced by the commit
eb82a3d846fa (phy: omap-usb2: Balance pm_runtime_enable() on probe failure
 and remove).
This because the call to pm_runtime_enable() function is moved after the
call to devm_phy_create() function, which has side effect since later in
the subsequent calls of devm_phy_create() there is a check with
pm_runtime_enabled() to configure few things.
