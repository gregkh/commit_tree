ARM: 8138/1: drop ISAR0 workaround for B15

The Brahma-B15's ISAR0 correcty advertises UDIV/SDIV support in both ARM
and Thumb2 modes (CPUID_EXT_ISAR0=02101110), so we don't need to
manually apply this hwcap.

The code in question actually predates the following commit, which made
our hwcaps unnecessary:
