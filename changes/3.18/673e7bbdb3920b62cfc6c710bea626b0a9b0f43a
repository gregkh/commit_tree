drm/i915: intel_backlight scale() math WA

Improper truncated integer division in the scale() function causes
actual_brightness != brightness. This (partial) work-around should be
sufficient for a majority of use-cases, but it is by no means a complete
solution.

TODO: Determine how best to scale "user" values to "hw" values, and
vice-versa, when the ranges are of different sizes. That would be a
buggy scenario even with this work-around.

The issue was introduced in the following (v3.17-rc1) commit:

    6dda730 drm/i915: respect the VBT minimum backlight brightness

Note that for easier backporting this commit adds a duplicated macro.
A follow-up cleanup patch rectifies this for 3.18+

v2: (thanks to Chris Wilson) clarify commit message, use rounded division
macro

v3: -DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST() fails to build with CONFIG_X86_32=y. (Jani)
    -Use DIV_ROUND_CLOSEST_ULL() instead. (Damien)
    -v1 and v2 originally authored by Joe Konno.
