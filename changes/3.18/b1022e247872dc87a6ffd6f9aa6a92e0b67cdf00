power: charger-manager: Check charging state right after completed initialization

This patch check the charging state after completed initialization of charger-
manager and update current charging state. If charger-manager never check and
update current charging state, charger-manager would have the mismatch issue
between real state of cable connection and the charging state of charger-manager
until first polling time of charger-manager.
