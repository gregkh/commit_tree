autofs4: allow RCU-walk to walk through autofs4

This series teaches autofs about RCU-walk so that we don't drop straight
into REF-walk when we hit an autofs directory, and so that we avoid
spinlocks as much as possible when performing an RCU-walk.

This is needed so that the benefits of the recent NFS support for
RCU-walk are fully available when NFS filesystems are automounted.

Patches have been carefully reviewed and tested both with test suites
and in production - thanks a lot to Ian Kent for his support there.

This patch (of 6):

Any attempt to look up a pathname that passes though an autofs4 mount is
currently forced out of RCU-walk into REF-walk.

This can significantly hurt performance of many-thread work loads on
many-core systems, especially if the automounted filesystem supports
RCU-walk but doesn't get to benefit from it.

So if autofs4_d_manage is called with rcu_walk set, only fail with -ECHILD
if it is necessary to wait longer than a spinlock.
