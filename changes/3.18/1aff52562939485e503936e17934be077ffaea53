NFS/SUNRPC: Remove other deadlock-avoidance mechanisms in nfs_release_page()

Now that nfs_release_page() doesn't block indefinitely, other deadlock
avoidance mechanisms aren't needed.
 - it doesn't hurt for kswapd to block occasionally.  If it doesn't
   want to block it would clear __GFP_WAIT.  The current_is_kswapd()
   was only added to avoid deadlocks and we have a new approach for
   that.
 - memory allocation in the SUNRPC layer can very rarely try to
   ->releasepage() a page it is trying to handle.  The deadlock
   is removed as nfs_release_page() doesn't block indefinitely.

So we don't need to set PF_FSTRANS for sunrpc network operations any
more.
