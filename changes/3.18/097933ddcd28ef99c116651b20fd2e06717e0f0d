isdn/gigaset: limit raw CAPI message dump length

In dump_rawmsg, the length field from a received data package was
used unscrutinized, allowing an attacker to control the size of the
allocated buffer and the number of times the output loop iterates.
Fix by limiting to a reasonable value.

Spotted with Coverity.
