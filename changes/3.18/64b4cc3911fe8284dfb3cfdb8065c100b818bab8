9p/trans_virtio: enable VQs early

virtio spec requires drivers to set DRIVER_OK before using VQs.
This is set automatically after probe returns, but virtio 9p device
adds self to channel list within probe, at which point VQ can be
used in violation of the spec.

To fix, call virtio_device_ready before using VQs.
