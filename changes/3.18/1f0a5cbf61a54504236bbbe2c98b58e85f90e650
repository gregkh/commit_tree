dmaengine: Fix allocation size for PL330 data buffer depth.

The datasheet for PL330 says that the data buffer value in the CRD
register is 10bits wide. However, the value stored is "minus one",
which the driver corrects for. Maximum value that the data buffer
depth can have is 1024 lines, which requires 11 bits for storage.

While making updates I found printing the peripheral ID as a hex
value to be more useful as the datasheet shows the values that way.
