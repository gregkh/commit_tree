kbuild: simplify build, clean, modbuiltin shorthands

$(if $(KBUILD_SRC),$(srctree)/) was a useful strategy
to omit a long absolute path for in-source-tree build
prior to commit 890676c65d699db3ad82e7dddd0cf8fb449031af
(kbuild: Use relative path when building in the source tree).

Now $(srctree) is "." when building in the source tree.
It would not be annoying to add "$(srctree)/" all the time.
