ARM: 8183/1: l2c: Improve l2c310_of_parse() error message

Russell King suggested [1]:

"I'd ask for one change.  Please make all these messages start with
"L2C-310 OF" not "PL310 OF:".  The device is described in ARM
documentation as a L2C-310 not PL310.  (Also note the : is dropped
too - most of the other messages don't have the : either.)

The:

"PL310 OF: cache setting yield illegal associativity
PL310 OF: -1073346556 calculated, only 8 and 16 legal"

message could also be changed to something like:

"L2C-310 OF cache associativity %d invalid, only 8 or 16 permittedn"
