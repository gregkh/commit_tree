proc/maps: make vm_is_stack() logic namespace-friendly

- Rename vm_is_stack() to task_of_stack() and change it to return
  "struct task_struct *" rather than the global (and thus wrong in
  general) pid_t.

- Add the new pid_of_stack() helper which calls task_of_stack() and
  uses the right namespace to report the correct pid_t.

  Unfortunately we need to define this helper twice, in task_mmu.c
  and in task_nommu.c. perhaps it makes sense to add fs/proc/util.c
  and move at least pid_of_stack/task_of_stack there to avoid the
  code duplication.

- Change show_map_vma() and show_numa_map() to use the new helper.
