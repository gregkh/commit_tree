KVM: static inline empty kvm_arch functions

Using static inline is going to save few bytes and cycles.
For example on powerpc, the difference is 700 B after stripping.
(5 kB before)

This patch also deals with two overlooked empty functions:
kvm_arch_flush_shadow was not removed from arch/mips/kvm/mips.c
  2df72e9bc KVM: split kvm_arch_flush_shadow
and kvm_arch_sched_in never made it into arch/ia64/kvm/kvm-ia64.c.
  e790d9ef6 KVM: add kvm_arch_sched_in
