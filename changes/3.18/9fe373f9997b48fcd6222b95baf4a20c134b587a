PCI: Increase IBM ipr SAS Crocodile BARs to at least system page size

The Crocodile chip occasionally comes up with 4k and 8k BAR sizes.  Due to
an erratum, setting the SR-IOV page size causes the physical function BARs
to expand to the system page size.  Since ppc64 uses 64k pages, when Linux
tries to assign the smaller resource sizes to the now 64k BARs the address
will be truncated and the BARs will overlap.

Force Linux to allocate the resource as a full page, which avoids the
overlap.
