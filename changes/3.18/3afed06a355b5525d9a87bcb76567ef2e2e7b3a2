x86, boot: Don't compile early_serial_console.c when !CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK

All the code in early_serial_console.c gets compiled out if
!CONFIG_EARLY_PRINTK, but early_serial_console.o itself still gets
compiled in.  Eliminate it from the compile entirely in that case.

This does not change the generated code at all, in either case.
