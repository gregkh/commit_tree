stmmac: correct mc_filter local variable in set_filter and set_mac_addr call

Testing revealed that the local variable mc_filter was dimensioned
incorrectly for all possible configurations and get_mac_addr should
have been set_mac_addr (a typo). Make sure mc_filter is dimensioned
to 8 32-bit unsigned longs - the largest size of the Synopsys
multicast filter register set.
