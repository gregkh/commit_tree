drm/i915: vlv: fix gunit HW state corruption during S4 suspend

During S4 freeze we don't call intel_suspend_complete(), which would
save the gunit HW state, but during S4 thaw/restore events we call
intel_resume_prepare() which restores it, thus ending up in a corrupted
HW state.

Fix this by calling intel_suspend_complete() from the corresponding
freeze_late event handler.
