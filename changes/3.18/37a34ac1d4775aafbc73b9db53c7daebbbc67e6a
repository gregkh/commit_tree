arm: kvm: fix CPU hotplug

On some platforms with no power management capabilities, the hotplug
implementation is allowed to return from a smp_ops.cpu_die() call as a
function return. Upon a CPU onlining event, the KVM CPU notifier tries
to reinstall the hyp stub, which fails on platform where no reset took
place following a hotplug event, with the message:

CPU1: smp_ops.cpu_die() returned, trying to resuscitate
CPU1: Booted secondary processor
Kernel panic - not syncing: unexpected prefetch abort in Hyp mode at: 0x80409540
unexpected data abort in Hyp mode at: 0x80401fe8
unexpected HVC/SVC trap in Hyp mode at: 0x805c6170

since KVM code is trying to reinstall the stub on a system where it is
already configured.

To prevent this issue, this patch adds a check in the KVM hotplug
notifier that detects if the HYP stub really needs re-installing when a
CPU is onlined and skips the installation call if the stub is already in
place, which means that the CPU has not been reset.
