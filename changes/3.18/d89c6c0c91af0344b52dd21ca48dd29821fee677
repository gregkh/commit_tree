ALSA: hda - Add TLV_DB_SCALE_MUTE bit for relevant controls

The DACs on Sigmatel/IDT codecs do mute at the lowest volume level,
and in the earlier drivers, we passed TLV_DB_SCALE_MUTE bit for each
volume control element like Speaker and Headphone as well as Master.
Along with the translation to the generic parser, however, the TLV bit
was lost for the slave controls (e.g. Speaker) but set only to
Master.  In theory this should have sufficed, but apps, particularly
PA, do care the slave volume bits, so we seem to see a regression in
the volume controls.

This patch adds a flag to hda_gen_spec to specify the DAC mute
feature, and adds the TLV bit properly for all relevant volume
controls.  Also, the TLV bit for vmaster is set in hda_generic.c, so
that we can get rid of all tricks from the codec driver side.

As the similar hack is applied to Conexant 5051 stuff, we can get rid
of it as well.
