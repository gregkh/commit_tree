selinux: fix a problem with IPv6 traffic denials in selinux_ip_postroute()

A previous commit c0828e50485932b7e019df377a6b0a8d1ebd3080 ("selinux:
process labeled IPsec TCP SYN-ACK packets properly in
selinux_ip_postroute()") mistakenly left out a 'break' from a switch
statement which caused problems with IPv6 traffic.

Thanks to Florian Westphal for reporting and debugging the issue.
