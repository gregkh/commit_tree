ASoC: fsl_esai: refine esai for TDM support

Original driver didn't store the number of slots, just fix the slot number
to 2, use this default number to calculate bclk and pins for TX/RX.
In this patch, add one parameter for slots, and update the calculation of
bclk and pins of TX/RX. Then driver will be compatible with slots > 2 in
TDM mode.
