driver core: Remove kerneldoc from local function

The deferred_probe_work_func() function is locally scoped, therefore an
associated kerneldoc comment isn't very useful. Replace the kerneldoc
opening marker (/**) with a regular block comment marker (/*) to avoid
the comment from being parsed by kerneldoc. This gets rid of a warning
caused by a missing description for the "work" argument.
