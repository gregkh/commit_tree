powerpc: Wire up sys_bpf() syscall

This patch wires up the new syscall sys_bpf() on powerpc.

Passes the tests in samples/bpf:

    #1 unreachable OK
    #2 unreachable2 OK
    #3 out of range jump OK
    #4 out of range jump2 OK

    #6 test2 ld_imm64 OK
    #7 test3 ld_imm64 OK
    #8 test4 ld_imm64 OK
    #9 test5 ld_imm64 OK
    #10 no bpf_exit OK
    #11 loop (back-edge) OK
    #12 loop2 (back-edge) OK
    #13 conditional loop OK
