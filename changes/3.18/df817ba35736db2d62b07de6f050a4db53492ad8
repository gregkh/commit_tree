NFSv4: fix open/lock state recovery error handling

The current open/lock state recovery unfortunately does not handle errors
such as NFS4ERR_CONN_NOT_BOUND_TO_SESSION correctly. Instead of looping,
just proceeds as if the state manager is finished recovering.
This patch ensures that we loop back, handle higher priority errors
and complete the open/lock state recovery.
