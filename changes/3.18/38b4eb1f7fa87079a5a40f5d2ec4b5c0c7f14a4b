NFC: trf7970a: Recalculate driver timeout values

Some of the timeout values used in the driver
are not long enough to handle worst-case scenarios
so they need to be recalculated.

The time to wait for the FIFO to drain past the
low-watermark is now 20 ms because it can take
around 14.35 ms to send 95 bytes (127 bytes in
full FIFO minus 32 bytes where the low-watermark
interrupt will fire).  95 bytes will take around
14.35 ms at 6.62 kbps (the lowest supported bit
rate used by ISO/IEC 15693) so 20 ms should be a
safe value.

The time to wait before issuing an EOF to complete
an ISO/IEC 15693 write or lock command is 40 ms--
20 ms to drain the FIFO and another 20 ms to ensure
the wait is long enough before sending an EOF.
