rcu: Rationalize kthread spawning

Currently, RCU spawns kthreads from several different early_initcall()
functions.  Although this has served RCU well for quite some time,
as more kthreads are added a more deterministic approach is required.
This commit therefore causes all of RCU's early-boot kthreads to be
spawned from a single early_initcall() function.
