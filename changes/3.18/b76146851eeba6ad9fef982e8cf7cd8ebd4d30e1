perf/x86/intel: Remove incorrect model number from Haswell perf

71 is a Broadwell, not a Haswell. The model number was added
by mistake earlier.

Remove it for now, until it can be re-added later with
real Broadwell support.

In practice it does not cause a lot of issues because the Broadwell
PMU is very similar to Haswell, but some details were wrong,
and it's better to handle it correctly.
