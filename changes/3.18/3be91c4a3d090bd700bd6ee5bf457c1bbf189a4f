block: Deprecate the use of the term sector in the context of block integrity

The protection interval is not necessarily tied to the logical block
size of a block device. Stop using the terms "sector" and "sectors".

Going forward we will use the term "seed" to describe the initial
reference tag value for a given I/O. "Interval" will be used to describe
the portion of the data buffer that a given piece of protection
information is associated with.
