ARM: dts: vf610: Add USB PHY and controller

This adds USB PHY and USB controller nodes. Vybrid SoCs have two
independent USB cores which each supports DR (dual role). However,
real OTG is not supported since the OTG ID pin is not available.

The PHYs are located within the anadig register range, hence we need
to change the length of the anadig registers.
