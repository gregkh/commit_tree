sched/fair: Replace rcu_assign_pointer() with RCU_INIT_POINTER()

The use of "rcu_assign_pointer()" is NULLing out the pointer.

it is better to use it instead of rcu_assign_pointer() because it has a
smaller overhead.

The following Coccinelle semantic patch was used:

 - rcu_assign_pointer
 + RCU_INIT_POINTER
