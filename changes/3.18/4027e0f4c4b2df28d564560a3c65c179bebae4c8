Btrfs: clear compress-force when remounting with compress option

Steps to reproduce:
 # mkfs.btrfs -f /dev/sdb
 # mount /dev/sdb /mnt -o compress-force=lzo
 # mount /dev/sdb /mnt -o remount,compress=zlib
 # cat /proc/mounts

Remounting from compress-force to compress could not clear compress-force
option. The problem is there is no way for users to clear compress-force
option separately.

Fix this problem by clearing @FORCE_COMPRESS flag when remounting to
compress=xxx.
