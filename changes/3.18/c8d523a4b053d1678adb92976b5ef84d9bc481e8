drivers/rtc/rtc-pm8xxx.c: rework to support pm8941 rtc

Adds support for RTC device inside PM8941 PMIC.  The RTC in this PMIC
have two register spaces.  Thus the rtc-pm8xxx is slightly reworked to
reflect these differences.

The register set for different PMIC chips are selected on DT compatible
string base.
