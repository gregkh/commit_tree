x86: Add "make tinyconfig" to configure the tiniest possible kernel

Since commit 5d2acfc7b974bbd3858b4dd3f2cdc6362dd8843a ("kconfig: make
allnoconfig disable options behind EMBEDDED and EXPERT") in 3.15-rc1,
"make allnoconfig" disables every possible config option.

However, a few configuration options (CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE,
OPTIMIZE_INLINING) produce a smaller kernel when turned on, and a few
choices exist (compression, highmem, allocator) for which a non-default
option produces a smaller kernel.

Add a "tinyconfig" option, which starts from allnoconfig and then sets
these options to configure the tiniest possible kernel.  This provides a
better baseline for embedded systems or efforts to reduce kernel size.
