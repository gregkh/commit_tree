tcp: avoid possible arithmetic overflows

icsk_rto is a 32bit field, and icsk_backoff can reach 15 by default,
or more if some sysctl (eg tcp_retries2) are changed.

Better use 64bit to perform icsk_rto << icsk_backoff operations

As Joe Perches suggested, add a helper for this.

Yuchung spotted the tcp_v4_err() case.
