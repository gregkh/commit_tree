Btrfs: fix race in WAIT_SYNC ioctl

We check whether transid is already committed via last_trans_committed and
then search through trans_list for pending transactions.  If
last_trans_committed is updated by btrfs_commit_transaction after we check
it (there is no locking), we will fail to find the committed transaction
and return EINVAL to the caller.  This has been observed occasionally by
ceph-osd (which uses this ioctl heavily).

Fix by rechecking whether the provided transid <= last_trans_committed
after the search fails, and if so return 0.
