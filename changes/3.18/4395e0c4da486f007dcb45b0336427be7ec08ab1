Btrfs: send, lower mem requirements for processing xattrs

Maximum xattr size can be up to nearly the leaf size. For an fs with a
leaf size larger than the page size, using kmalloc requires allocating
multiple pages that are contiguous, which might not be possible if
there's heavy memory fragmentation. Therefore fallback to vmalloc if
we fail to allocate with kmalloc. Also start with a smaller buffer size,
since xattr values typically are smaller than a page.
