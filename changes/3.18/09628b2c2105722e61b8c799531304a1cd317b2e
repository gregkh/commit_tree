[media] dib0700_devices: Use c99 initializers for structures.

A simplified version of the semantic match that finds this problem is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@decl@
identifier i1,fld;
type T;
field list[n] fs;
@@

struct i1 {
 fs
 T fld;
 ...};

@bad@
identifier decl.i1,i2;
expression e;
initializer list[decl.n] is;
@@

struct i1 i2 = { is,
+ .fld = e
- e
 ,...};
// </smpl>

Not sure why, but some tables are still using the old way,
but at least several of them got fixed.
