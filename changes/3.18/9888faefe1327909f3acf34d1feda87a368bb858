net: sched: cls_basic use RCU

Enable basic classifier for RCU.

Dereferencing tp->root may look a bit strange here but it is needed
by my accounting because it is allocated at init time and needs to
be kfree'd at destroy time. However because it may be referenced in
the classify() path we must wait an RCU grace period before free'ing
it. We use kfree_rcu() and rcu_ APIs to enforce this. This pattern
is used in all the classifiers.

Also the hgenerator can be incremented without concern because it
is always incremented under RTNL.
