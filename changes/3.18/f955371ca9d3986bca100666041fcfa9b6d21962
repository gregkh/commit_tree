x86: remove the Xen-specific _PAGE_IOMAP PTE flag

The _PAGE_IO_MAP PTE flag was only used by Xen PV guests to mark PTEs
that were used to map I/O regions that are 1:1 in the p2m.  This
allowed Xen to obtain the correct PFN when converting the MFNs read
from a PTE back to their PFN.

Xen guests no longer use _PAGE_IOMAP for this. Instead mfn_to_pfn()
returns the correct PFN by using a combination of the m2p and p2m to
determine if an MFN corresponds to a 1:1 mapping in the the p2m.

Remove _PAGE_IOMAP, replacing it with _PAGE_UNUSED2 to allow for
future uses of the PTE flag.
