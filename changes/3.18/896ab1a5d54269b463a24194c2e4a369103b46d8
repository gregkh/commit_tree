drm/i915: Fix up checks for aliasing ppgtt

A subsequent patch will no longer initialize the aliasing ppgtt if we
have full ppgtt enabled, since we simply don't need that any more.

Unfortunately a few places check for the aliasing ppgtt instead of
checking for ppgtt in general. Fix them up.

One special case are the gtt offset and size macros, which have some
code to remap the aliasing ppgtt to the global gtt. The aliasing ppgtt
is _not_ a logical address space, so passing that in as the vm is
plain and simple a bug. So just WARN about it and carry on - we have a
gracefully fall-through anyway if we can't find the vma.
