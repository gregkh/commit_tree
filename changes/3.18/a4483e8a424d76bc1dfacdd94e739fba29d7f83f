ceph: remove redundant code for max file size verification

Both ceph_update_writeable_page and ceph_setattr will verify file size
with max size ceph supported.
There are two caller for ceph_update_writeable_page, ceph_write_begin and
ceph_page_mkwrite. For ceph_write_begin, we have already verified the size in
generic_write_checks of ceph_write_iter; for ceph_page_mkwrite, we have no
chance to change file size when mmap. Likewise we have already verified the size
in inode_change_ok when we call ceph_setattr.
So let's remove the redundant code for max file size verification.
