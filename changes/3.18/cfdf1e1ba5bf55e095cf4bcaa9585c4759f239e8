udptunnel: Add SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL during gro_complete.

When doing GRO processing for UDP tunnels, we never add
SKB_GSO_UDP_TUNNEL to gso_type - only the type of the inner protocol
is added (such as SKB_GSO_TCPV4). The result is that if the packet is
later resegmented we will do GSO but not treat it as a tunnel. This
results in UDP fragmentation of the outer header instead of (i.e.) TCP
segmentation of the inner header as was originally on the wire.
