KVM: SVM: add rdmsr support for AMD event registers

Current KVM only supports RDMSR for K7_EVNTSEL0 and K7_PERFCTR0
MSRs. Reading the rest MSRs will trigger KVM to inject #GP into
guest VM. This causes a warning message "Failed to access perfctr
msr (MSR c0010001 is ffffffffffffffff)" on AMD host. This patch
adds RDMSR support for all K7_EVNTSELn and K7_PERFCTRn registers
and thus supresses the warning message.
