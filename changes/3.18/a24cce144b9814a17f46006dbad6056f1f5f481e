Bluetooth: Fix reference counting of global L2CAP channels

When looking up entries from the global L2CAP channel list there needs
to be a guarantee that other code doesn't go and remove the entry after
a channel has been returned by the lookup function. This patch makes
sure that the channel reference is incremented before the read lock is
released in the global channel lookup functions. The patch also adds the
corresponding l2cap_chan_put() calls once the channels pointers are
no-longer needed.
