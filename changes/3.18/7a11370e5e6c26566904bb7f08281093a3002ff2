virtio_blk: enable VQs early

virtio spec requires drivers to set DRIVER_OK before using VQs.
This is set automatically after probe returns, virtio block violated this
rule by calling add_disk, which causes the VQ to be used directly within
probe.

To fix, call virtio_device_ready before using VQs.
