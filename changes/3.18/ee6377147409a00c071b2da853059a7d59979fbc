bonding: Simplify the xmit function for modes that use xmit_hash

Earlier change to use usable slave array for TLB mode had an additional
performance advantage. So extending the same logic to all other modes
that use xmit-hash for slave selection (viz 802.3AD, and XOR modes).
Also consolidating this with the earlier TLB change.

The main idea is to build the usable slaves array in the control path
and use that array for slave selection during xmit operation.

Measured performance in a setup with a bond of 4x1G NICs with 200
instances of netperf for the modes involved (3ad, xor, tlb)
cmd: netperf -t TCP_RR -H <TargetHost> -l 60 -s 5

Mode        TPS-Before   TPS-After

802.3ad   : 468,694      493,101
TLB (lb=0): 392,583      392,965
XOR       : 475,696      484,517
