mm/balloon_compaction: fix deflation when compaction is disabled

If CONFIG_BALLOON_COMPACTION=n balloon_page_insert() does not link pages
with balloon and doesn't set PagePrivate flag, as a result
balloon_page_dequeue() cannot get any pages because it thinks that all
of them are isolated.  Without balloon compaction nobody can isolate
ballooned pages.  It's safe to remove this check.
