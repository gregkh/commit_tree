ext4: add ext4_iget_normal() which is to be used for dir tree lookups

If there is a corrupted file system which has directory entries that
point at reserved, metadata inodes, prohibit them from being used by
treating them the same way we treat Boot Loader inodes --- that is,
mark them to be bad inodes.  This prohibits them from being opened,
deleted, or modified via chmod, chown, utimes, etc.

In particular, this prevents a corrupted file system which has a
directory entry which points at the journal inode from being deleted
and its blocks released, after which point Much Hilarity Ensues.
