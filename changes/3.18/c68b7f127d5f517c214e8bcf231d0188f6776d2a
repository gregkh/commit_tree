Bluetooth: Fix dereferencing conn variable before NULL check

This patch fixes the following type of static analyzer warning (and
probably a real bug as well as the NULL check should be there for a
reason):

net/bluetooth/smp.c:1182 smp_conn_security() warn: variable dereferenced before check 'conn' (see line 1174)
