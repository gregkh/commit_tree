efi-bgrt: Add error handling; inform the user when ignoring the BGRT

Gracefully handle failures to allocate memory for the image, which might
be arbitrarily large.

efi_bgrt_init can fail in various ways as well, usually because the
BIOS-provided BGRT structure does not match expectations.  Add
appropriate error messages rather than failing silently.
