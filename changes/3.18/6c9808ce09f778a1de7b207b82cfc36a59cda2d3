tipc: remove port_lock

In previous commits we have reduced usage of port_lock to a minimum,
and complemented it with usage of bh_lock_sock() at the remaining
locations. The purpose has been to remove this lock altogether, since
it largely duplicates the role of bh_lock_sock. We are now ready to do
this.

However, we still need to protect the BH callers from inadvertent
release of the socket while they hold a reference to it. We do this by
replacing port_lock by a combination of a rw-lock protecting the
reference table as such, and updating the socket reference counter while
the socket is referenced from BH. This technique is more standard and
comprehensible than the previous approach, and turns out to have a
positive effect on overall performance.
