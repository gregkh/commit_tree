arm64: add PSCI CPU_SUSPEND based cpu_suspend support

This patch implements the cpu_suspend cpu operations method through
the PSCI CPU SUSPEND API. The PSCI implementation translates the idle state
index passed by the cpu_suspend core call into a valid PSCI state according to
the PSCI states initialized at boot through the cpu_init_idle() CPU
operations hook.

The PSCI CPU suspend operation hook checks if the PSCI state is a
standby state. If it is, it calls the PSCI suspend implementation
straight away, without saving any context. If the state is a power
down state the kernel calls the __cpu_suspend API (that saves the CPU
context) and passed the PSCI suspend finisher as a parameter so that PSCI
can be called by the __cpu_suspend implementation after saving and flushing
the context as last function before power down.

For power down states, entry point is set to cpu_resume physical address,
that represents the default kernel execution address following a CPU reset.
