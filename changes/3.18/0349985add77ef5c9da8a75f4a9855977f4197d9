KVM: s390: Limit guest size to 16TB

Currently we fill up a full 5 level page table to hold the guest
mapping. Since commit "support gmap page tables with less than 5
levels" we can do better.
Having more than 4 TB might be useful for some testing scenarios,
so let's just limit ourselves to 16TB guest size.
Having more than that is totally untested as I do not have enough
swap space/memory.

We continue to allow ucontrol the full size.
