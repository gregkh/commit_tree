ufs: fix NULL dereference when no regulators are defined

If no voltage supply regulators are defined for the UFS devices (assumed
they are always-on), ufshcd_config_vreg_load() can be called on
suspend/resume paths with vreg == NULL as hba->vreg_info.vcc* equal to
NULL, and it causes NULL pointer dereference.

This fixes it by making ufshcd_config_vreg_{h,l}pm noop when no regulators
are defined.
