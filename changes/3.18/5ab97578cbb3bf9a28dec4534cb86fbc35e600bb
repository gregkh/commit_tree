Add mfsymlinks support for SMB2.1/SMB3. Part 1 create symlink

Adds support on SMB2.1 and SMB3 mounts for emulation of symlinks
via the "Minshall/French" symlink format already used for cifs
mounts when mfsymlinks mount option is used (and also used by Apple).

This first patch adds support to create them.  The next patch will
add support for recognizing them and reading them.  Although CIFS/SMB3
have other types of symlinks, in the many use cases they aren't
practical (e.g. either require cifs only mounts with unix extensions
to Samba, or require the user to be Administrator to Windows for SMB3).
This also helps enable running additional xfstests over SMB3 (since some
xfstests directly or indirectly require symlink support).
