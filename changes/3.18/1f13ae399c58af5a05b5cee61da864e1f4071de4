mm: remove noisy remainder of the scan_unevictable interface

The deprecation warnings for the scan_unevictable interface triggers by
scripts doing `sysctl -a | grep something else'.  This is annoying and not
helpful.

The interface has been defunct since 264e56d8247e ("mm: disable user
interface to manually rescue unevictable pages"), which was in 2011, and
there haven't been any reports of usecases for it, only reports that the
deprecation warnings are annying.  It's unlikely that anybody is using
this interface specifically at this point, so remove it.
