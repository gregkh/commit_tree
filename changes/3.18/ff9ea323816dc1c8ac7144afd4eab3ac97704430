block, bdi: an active gendisk always has a request_queue associated with it

bdev_get_queue() returns the request_queue associated with the
specified block_device.  blk_get_backing_dev_info() makes use of
bdev_get_queue() to determine the associated bdi given a block_device.

All the callers of bdev_get_queue() including
blk_get_backing_dev_info() assume that bdev_get_queue() may return
NULL and implement NULL handling; however, bdev_get_queue() requires
the passed in block_device is opened and attached to its gendisk.
Because an active gendisk always has a valid request_queue associated
with it, bdev_get_queue() can never return NULL and neither can
blk_get_backing_dev_info().

Make it clear that neither of the two functions can return NULL and
remove NULL handling from all the callers.
