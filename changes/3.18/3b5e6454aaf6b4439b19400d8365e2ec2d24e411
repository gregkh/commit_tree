fs/buffer.c: support buffer cache allocations with gfp modifiers

A buffer cache is allocated from movable area because it is referred
for a while and released soon.  But some filesystems are taking buffer
cache for a long time and it can disturb page migration.

New APIs are introduced to allocate buffer cache with user specific
flag.  *_gfp APIs are for user want to set page allocation flag for
page cache allocation.  And *_unmovable APIs are for the user wants to
allocate page cache from non-movable area.
