qdisc: validate frames going through the direct_xmit path

In commit 50cbe9ab5f8d ("net: Validate xmit SKBs right when we
pull them out of the qdisc") the validation code was moved out of
dev_hard_start_xmit and into dequeue_skb.

However this overlooked the fact that we do not always enqueue
the skb onto a qdisc. First situation is if qdisc have flag
TCQ_F_CAN_BYPASS and qdisc is empty.  Second situation is if
there is no qdisc on the device, which is a common case for
software devices.

Originally spotted and inital patch by Alexander Duyck.
As a result Alex was seeing issues trying to connect to a
vhost_net interface after commit 50cbe9ab5f8d was applied.

Added a call to validate_xmit_skb() in __dev_xmit_skb(), in the
code path for qdiscs with TCQ_F_CAN_BYPASS flag, and in
__dev_queue_xmit() when no qdisc.

Also handle the error situation where dev_hard_start_xmit() could
return a skb list, and does not return dev_xmit_complete(rc) and
falls through to the kfree_skb(), in that situation it should
call kfree_skb_list().
