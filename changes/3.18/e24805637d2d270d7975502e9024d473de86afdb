target: Fix APTPL metadata handling for dynamic MappedLUNs

This patch fixes a bug in handling of SPC-3 PR Activate Persistence
across Target Power Loss (APTPL) logic where re-creation of state for
MappedLUNs from dynamically generated NodeACLs did not occur during
I_T Nexus establishment.

It adds the missing core_scsi3_check_aptpl_registration() call during
core_tpg_check_initiator_node_acl() -> core_tpg_add_node_to_devs() in
order to replay any pre-loaded APTPL metadata state associated with
the newly connected SCSI Initiator Port.
