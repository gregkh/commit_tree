scsi: ufs: fix static checker warning in __ufshcd_setup_clocks

This patch fixes newly introduced static checker warning in
__ufshcd_setup_clocks, introduced by UFS power management series.

Warning:
drivers/scsi/ufs/ufshcd.c:4474 __ufshcd_setup_clocks()
warn: we tested 'ret' before and it was 'false'

To fix it we remove the (!ret) from the condition.
