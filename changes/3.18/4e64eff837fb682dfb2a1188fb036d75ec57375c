NFC: trf7970a: Add RF technology specific guard times

When turning on the RF field, the driver must wait
an RF-technology-specific amount of time (known as
the guard time) before modulating the field.
Currently, the driver waits 5 ms but that is too
short for NFCF and too long for ISO/IEC 15693.
Fix this by determining the guard time when the
RF technology is set and delaying that amount
of time when turning on the RF field.
