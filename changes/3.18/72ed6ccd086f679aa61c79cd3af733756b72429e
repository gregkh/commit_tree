drm/exynos: switch to universal plane API

The patch replaces legacy functions
drm_plane_init() / drm_crtc_init() with
drm_universal_plane_init() and drm_crtc_init_with_planes().
It allows to replace fake primary plane with the real one.
Additionally the patch leaves cleanup of crtcs to core,
this way planes and crtcs are cleaned in correct order.
