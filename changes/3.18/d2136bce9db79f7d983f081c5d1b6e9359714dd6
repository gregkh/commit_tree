ARM: OMAP5 / DRA7: PM: Set MPUSS-EMIF clock-domain static dependency

With EMIF clock-domain put under hardware supervised control, memory
corruption and untraceable crashes are observed on OMAP5. Further
investigation revealed that there is a weakness in the PRCM on this
specific dynamic depedency.

The recommendation is to set MPUSS static dependency towards EMIF
clock-domain to avoid issues. This recommendation holds good for DRA7
family of devices as well.
