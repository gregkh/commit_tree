block: Fix computation of merged request priority

Priority of a merged request is computed by ioprio_best(). If one of the
requests has undefined priority (IOPRIO_CLASS_NONE) and another request
has priority from IOPRIO_CLASS_BE, the function will return the
undefined priority which is wrong. Fix the function to properly return
priority of a request with the defined priority.
