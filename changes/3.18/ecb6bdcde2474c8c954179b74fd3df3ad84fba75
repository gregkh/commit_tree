m68knommu: fix size of address field for 5272 interrupt controller

Picked up by the 0-day buidler:

All warnings:
>> arch/m68k/coldfire/intc-5272.c:46:20: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Woverflow]
     /*MCF_IRQ_EINT1*/ { .icr = MCFSIM_ICR1, .index = 28, .ack = 1, },
...

The problem stems from the changes to make all ColdFire register addresses
absolute, in commit d72a5abb ("make remaining ColdFire 5272 register
definitions absolute"). That change did not take into account that the
addresses were stored as offsets in the irqmap of the intc-5272.c code.
Make the field that now stores register addresses big enough to hold
addresses.
