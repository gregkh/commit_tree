locking/mutexes: Refactor optimistic spinning code

When we fail to acquire the mutex in the fastpath, we end up calling
__mutex_lock_common(). A *lot* goes on in this function. Move out the
optimistic spinning code into mutex_optimistic_spin() and simplify
the former a bit. Furthermore, this is similar to what we have in
rwsems. No logical changes.
