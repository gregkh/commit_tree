nohz: nohz full depends on irq work self IPI support

The nohz full functionality depends on IRQ work to trigger its own
interrupts. As it's used to restart the tick, we can't rely on the tick
fallback for irq work callbacks, ie: we can't use the tick to restart
the tick itself.

Lets reject the full dynticks initialization if that arch support isn't
available.

As a side effect, this makes sure that nohz kick is never called from
the tick. That otherwise would result in illegal hrtimer self-cancellation
and lockup.
