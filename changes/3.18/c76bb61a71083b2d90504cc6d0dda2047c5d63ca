drm/i915/bdw: BDW Software Turbo

BDW supports GT C0 residency reporting in constant time unit. Driver
calculates GT utilization based on C0 residency and adjusts RP
frequency up/down accordingly. For offscreen workload specificly,
set frequency to RP0.

Offscreen task is not restricted by frame rate, it can be
executed as soon as possible. Transcoding and serilized workload
between CPU and GPU both need high GT performance, RP0 is a good
option in this case. RC6 will kick in to compensate power
consumption when GT is not active.

v2: Rebase on recent drm-intel-nightly
v3: Add flip timerout monitor, when no flip is deteced within
100ms, set frequency to RP0.
