ipvs: reduce stack usage for sockopt data

Use union to reserve the required stack space for sockopt data
which is less than the currently hardcoded value of 128.
Now the tables for commands should be more readable.
The checks added for readability are optimized by compiler,
others warn at compile time if command uses too much
stack or exceeds the storage of set_arglen and get_arglen.

As Dan Carpenter points out, we can run for unprivileged user,
so we can silent some error messages.
