drm/i915/bdw: Skeleton for the new logical rings submission path

Execlists are indeed a brave new world with respect to workload
submission to the GPU.

In previous version of these series, I have tried to impact the
legacy ringbuffer submission path as little as possible (mostly,
passing the context around and using the correct ringbuffer when I
needed one) but Daniel is afraid (probably with a reason) that
these changes and, especially, future ones, will end up breaking
older gens.

This commit and some others coming next will try to limit the
damage by creating an alternative path for workload submission.
The first step is here: laying out a new ring init/fini.
