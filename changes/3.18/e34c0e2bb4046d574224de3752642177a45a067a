ACPI / EC: Add detailed command/query debugging information.

Developers really don't need to translate EC commands in mind. This patch
adds detailed debugging information for the EC commands.
The address can be found in the follow-up sequential EC_DATA(W) accesses,
thus this patch also removes some of the redundant address information.
