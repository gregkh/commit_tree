staging: comedi: amplc_pci230: no need to manipulate PCI ref count

This driver no longer supports a "legacy" attach mechanism that searches
for a suitable PCI device and increments it's reference count, but since
the common "detach" handler `pci230_detach()` still has a left-over
`pci_dev_put()`, a matching `pci_dev_get()` is needed in the
"auto_attach" handler `pci230_auto_attach()`.  There is no longer any
reason to "get" and "put" the PCI device, so those calls can be removed.
