nfsd: split nfsd4_callback initialization and use

Split out initializing the nfs4_callback structure from using it.  For
the NULL callback this gets rid of tons of pointless re-initializations.

Note that I don't quite understand what protects us from running multiple
NULL callbacks at the same time, but at least this chance doesn't make
it worse..
