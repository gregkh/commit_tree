Input: cros_ec_keyb - optimize ghosting algorithm

Previous algorithm was a bit conservative and complicating with respect to
identifying key ghosting.  This CL uses the bitops hamming weight function
(hweight8) to count the number of matching rows for colM & colN.  If that
number is > 1 ghosting is present.

Additionally it removes NULL keys and our one virtual keypress KEY_BATTERY
from consideration as these inputs are never physical keypresses.
