net: Fix GRE RX to use skb_transport_header for GRE header offset

GRE assumes that the GRE header is at skb_network_header +
ip_hrdlen(skb). It is more general to use skb_transport_header
and this allows the possbility of inserting additional header
between IP and GRE (which is what we will done in Generic UDP
Encapsulation for GRE).
