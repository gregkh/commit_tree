staging: comedi: adl_pci9118: clarify acquisition mode (ai_do) determination

The async command can operation in 4 modes in this driver.

Modes 1 and 4 use timers 1 and 2 as a cascaded timer to trigger each conversion.
Mode 1 begins the acquisitions immediately (scan_begin_src == TRIG_FOLLOW) and
Mode 4 begins after an external trigger (scan_begin_src == TRIG_EXT). Both modes
use a convert_src == TRIG_TIMER.

Mode 2 uses timers 1 and 2 in a double timed action (scan_begin_src == TRIG_TIMER
and convert_src != TRIG_EXT (TRIG_TIMER and TRIG_NOW are valid)).

Mode 3 does not use the timers. Each acquisition is triggered by an external
signal (scan_begin_src == TRIG_FOLLOW and convert_src == TRIG_EXT.

The (*do_cmdtest) validates the scan_begin_src as TRIG_FOLLOW, TRIG_TIMER,
or TRIG_EXT. Remove the invalid check for TRIG_INT in the (*do_cmd).

Clarify the logic used to determine the mode in the (*do_cmd).

Also, simplify pci9118_calc_divisors(). Call i8253_cascade_ns_to_timer() directly
in the (*do_cmd) for the mode 1 and mode 4 cases. Call pci9118_calc_divisors()
only for mode 2 acquisitions.
