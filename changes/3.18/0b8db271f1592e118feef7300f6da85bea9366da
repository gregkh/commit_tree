ACPI / video: check _DOD list when creating backlight devices

The _DOD method lists which video output device is currently attached so
we should only care about them and ignore others. An user recently
reported that there are two acpi_video interfaces appeared on his system
and one of them doesn't work. From the acpidump, it is found that there
are more than one video output devices that have _BCM control method but
the _DOD lists only one of them. So this patch checks if the video output
device is in the _DOD list and will not create backlight device if it is
not in the list. Also, we consider the broken _DOD case(reflected by the
video->attached_count is 0) and do not change behaviour for those broken
_DOD systems.
