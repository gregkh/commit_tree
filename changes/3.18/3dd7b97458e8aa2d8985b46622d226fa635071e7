drm/i915: Hack to tie both common lanes together on chv

It looks like frobbing the cmnreset line on pne PHY disturbs the other
PHY on chv. The result is a black screen. On HDMI it's just a flash of
black, but DP usually falls over and can't get back up.

As a workaround set up the power domains so that both common lane
wells power up and down together. I also tried leaving the cmnreset
deasserted even the if the power well goes down but that didn't seem
acceptable to the PHY.
