mm/page_alloc: fix incorrect isolation behavior by rechecking migratetype

Before describing bugs itself, I first explain definition of freepage.

 1. pages on buddy list are counted as freepage.
 2. pages on isolate migratetype buddy list are *not* counted as freepage.
 3. pages on cma buddy list are counted as CMA freepage, too.

Now, I describe problems and related patch.

Patch 1: There is race conditions on getting pageblock migratetype that
it results in misplacement of freepages on buddy list, incorrect
freepage count and un-availability of freepage.

Patch 2: Freepages on pcp list could have stale cached information to
determine migratetype of buddy list to go.  This causes misplacement of
freepages on buddy list and incorrect freepage count.

Patch 4: Merging between freepages on different migratetype of
pageblocks will cause freepages accouting problem.  This patch fixes it.

Without patchset [3], above problem doesn't happens on my CMA allocation
test, because CMA reserved pages aren't used at all.  So there is no
chance for above race.

With patchset [3], I did simple CMA allocation test and get below
result:

 - Virtual machine, 4 cpus, 1024 MB memory, 256 MB CMA reservation
 - run kernel build (make -j16) on background
 - 30 times CMA allocation(8MB * 30 = 240MB) attempts in 5 sec interval
 - Result: more than 5000 freepage count are missed

With patchset [3] and this patchset, I found that no freepage count are
missed so that I conclude that problems are solved.

On my simple memory offlining test, these problems also occur on that
environment, too.

This patch (of 4):

There are two paths to reach core free function of buddy allocator,
__free_one_page(), one is free_one_page()->__free_one_page() and the
other is free_hot_cold_page()->free_pcppages_bulk()->__free_one_page().
Each paths has race condition causing serious problems.  At first, this
patch is focused on first type of freepath.  And then, following patch
will solve the problem in second type of freepath.

In the first type of freepath, we got migratetype of freeing page
without holding the zone lock, so it could be racy.  There are two cases
of this race.

 1. pages are added to isolate buddy list after restoring orignal
    migratetype

    CPU1                                   CPU2

    get migratetype => return MIGRATE_ISOLATE
    call free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE

                                grab the zone lock
                                unisolate pageblock
                                release the zone lock

    grab the zone lock
    call __free_one_page() with MIGRATE_ISOLATE
    freepage go into isolate buddy list,
    although pageblock is already unisolated

This may cause two problems.  One is that we can't use this page anymore
until next isolation attempt of this pageblock, because freepage is on
isolate buddy list.  The other is that freepage accouting could be wrong
due to merging between different buddy list.  Freepages on isolate buddy
list aren't counted as freepage, but ones on normal buddy list are
counted as freepage.  If merge happens, buddy freepage on normal buddy
list is inevitably moved to isolate buddy list without any consideration
of freepage accouting so it could be incorrect.

 2. pages are added to normal buddy list while pageblock is isolated.
    It is similar with above case.

This also may cause two problems.  One is that we can't keep these
freepages from being allocated.  Although this pageblock is isolated,
freepage would be added to normal buddy list so that it could be
allocated without any restriction.  And the other problem is same as
case 1, that it, incorrect freepage accouting.

This race condition would be prevented by checking migratetype again
with holding the zone lock.  Because it is somewhat heavy operation and
it isn't needed in common case, we want to avoid rechecking as much as
possible.  So this patch introduce new variable, nr_isolate_pageblock in
struct zone to check if there is isolated pageblock.  With this, we can
avoid to re-check migratetype in common case and do it only if there is
isolated pageblock or migratetype is MIGRATE_ISOLATE.  This solve above
mentioned problems.

Changes from v3:
Add one more check in free_one_page() that checks whether migratetype is
MIGRATE_ISOLATE or not. Without this, abovementioned case 1 could happens.
