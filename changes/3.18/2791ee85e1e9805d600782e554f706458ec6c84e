drm: replace weird conditional includes

pte_wrprotect() is only used by drm_vm.c, so move the include there. Also
include it unconditionally, all architectures provide this header!

Furthermore, replace asm/current.h with sched.h, which includes
asm/current.h unconditionally. This way we get the same effect and avoid
direct asm/ includes. Furthermore, drop the weird __alpha__ protection.
It's safe to include sched.h everywhere (and the wait.h comment doesn't
apply, anyway).
