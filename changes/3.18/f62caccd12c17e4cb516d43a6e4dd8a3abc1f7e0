spi: spi-imx: add DMA support

Enable DMA support on i.mx6. The read speed can increase from 600KB/s
to 1.2MB/s on i.mx6q. You can disable or enable dma function in dts.
If not set "dma-names" in dts, spi will use PIO mode. This patch only
validate on i.mx6, not i.mx5, but encourage ones to apply this patch
on i.mx5 since they share the same IP.

Note:
  Sometime, there is a weid data in rxfifo after one full tx/rx
transfer finish by DMA on i.mx6dl, so we disable dma functhion on
i.mx6dl.
