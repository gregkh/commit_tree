net: gso: use feature flag argument in all protocol gso handlers

skb_gso_segment() has a 'features' argument representing offload features
available to the output path.

A few handlers, e.g. GRE, instead re-fetch the features of skb->dev and use
those instead of the provided ones when handing encapsulation/tunnels.

Depending on dev->hw_enc_features of the output device skb_gso_segment() can
then return NULL even when the caller has disabled all GSO feature bits,
as segmentation of inner header thinks device will take care of segmentation.

This e.g. affects the tbf scheduler, which will silently drop GRE-encap GSO skbs
that did not fit the remaining token quota as the segmentation does not work
when device supports corresponding hw offload capabilities.
