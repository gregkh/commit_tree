autofs4: d_manage() should return -EISDIR when appropriate in rcu-walk mode.

If rcu-walk mode we don't *have* to return -EISDIR for non-mount-traps
as we will simply drop into REF-walk and handling DCACHE_NEED_AUTOMOUNT
dentrys the slow way.  But it is better if we do when possible.

In 'oz_mode', use the same condition as ref-walk: if not a mountpoint,
then it must be -EISDIR.

In regular mode there are most tests needed.  Most of them can be
performed without taking any spinlocks.  If we find a directory that
isn't obviously empty, and isn't mounted on, we need to call
'simple_empty()' which does take a spinlock.  If this turned out to hurt
performance, some other approach could be found to signal when a
directory is known to be empty.
