ceph: request xattrs if xattr_version is zero

Following sequence of events can happen.
  - Client releases an inode, queues cap release message.
  - A 'lookup' reply brings the same inode back, but the reply
    doesn't contain xattrs because MDS didn't receive the cap release
    message and thought client already has up-to-data xattrs.

The fix is force sending a getattr request to MDS if xattrs_version
is 0. The getattr mask is set to CEPH_STAT_CAP_XATTR, so MDS knows client
does not have xattr.
