netfilter: nf_reject_ipv6: split nf_send_reset6() in smaller functions

That can be reused by the reject bridge expression to build the reject
packet. The new functions are:

* nf_reject_ip6_tcphdr_get(): to sanitize and to obtain the TCP header.
* nf_reject_ip6hdr_put(): to build the IPv6 header.
* nf_reject_ip6_tcphdr_put(): to build the TCP header.
