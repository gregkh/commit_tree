locking/selftest: Support queued rwlock

The queued rwlock does not support the use of recursive read-lock in
the process context. With changes in the lockdep code to check and
disallow recursive read-lock, it is also necessary for the locking
selftest to be updated to change the process context recursive read
locking results from SUCCESS to FAILURE for rwlock.
