powerpc/mm: Use common paging_init() for NUMA

Commit 1c98025c6c95bc057a25e2c6596de23288c68160 "powerpc: Dynamic DMA
zone limits" updated how zones are created in paging_init(), but missed
the NUMA version of paging_init().  This was noticed via a linker
error, since dma_pfn_limit_to_zone() was, like the non-NUMA
paging_init(), limited by #ifndef CONFIG_NEED_MULTIPLE_NODES.

It turns out that the NUMA paging_init() was not actually doing
anything different from the standard paging_init(), other than a couple
debug prints, a couple 32-bit-only ifdef sections, and a call to
mark_nonram_nosave().  It's not clear whether mark_nonram_nosave() is
inherently wrong to do for NUMA, or just not useful on targets that
have NUMA, but for now I'm preserving the existing behavior.
