tty/vt/keyboard: Resolve many shadow warnings

Many local variables were given the same name as a global. This
is valid, but generates many shadow warnings in W=2 builds. Resolve
them by changing the local names. Also change local variables
named "up" because they shadow the semaphore "up" function. Also
moved the outer declaration of the variable "a" because it is
only used in one block, and that resolves all of the shadow warnings
for the other declarations of "a" that have different types.

Change diacr => dia, kbd => kb, rep => rpt, up => udp.
