clk: add pxa clocks infrastructure

Add a the common code used by all PXA variants.

This is the first step in the transition from architecture defined
clocks (in arch/arm/mach-pxa) towards clock framework. The goal is to
have the same features (and not all the features) of the existing
clocks, and enable the transition of PXA to device-tree.

All PXA rely on a "CKEN" type clock, which :
 - has a gate (bit in CKEN register)
 - is generated from a PLL, generally divided
 - has an alternate low power clock

Each variant will specialize the CKEN clock :
 - pxa25x have no low power clock
 - pxa27x in low power use always the 13 MHz ring oscillator
 - pxa3xx in low power have specific dividers for each clock

The device-tree provides a list of CLK_* (ex: CLK_USB or CLK_I2C) to get
a handle on the clock. While pxa-clock.h will describe all the clocks of
all the variants, each variant will only use a subset of it.
