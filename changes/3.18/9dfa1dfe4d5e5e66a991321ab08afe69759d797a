netfilter: nf_log: account for size of NLMSG_DONE attribute

We currently neither account for the nlattr size, nor do we consider
the size of the trailing NLMSG_DONE when allocating nlmsg skb.

This can result in nflog to stop working, as __nfulnl_send() re-tries
sending forever if it failed to append NLMSG_DONE (which will never
work if buffer is not large enough).
