ASoC: soc-dapm: fix use after free

Coverity spotted the following possible use-after-free condition in
dapm_create_or_share_mixmux_kcontrol():

If kcontrol is NULL, and (wname_in_long_name && kcname_in_long_name)
validates to true, 'name' will be set to an allocated string, and be
freed a few lines later via the 'long_name' alias. 'name', however,
is used by dev_err() in case snd_ctl_add() fails.

Fix this by adding a jump label that frees 'long_name' at the end of
the function.
