bdi: remove bdi->wb_lock locking around bdi->dev clearing in bdi_unregister()

The only places where NULL test on bdi->dev is used are
bdi_[un]register().  The functions can't be called in parallel anyway
and there's no point in protecting bdi->dev clearing with a lock.
Remove bdi->wb_lock grabbing around bdi->dev clearing and move it
after device_unregister() call so that bdi->dev doesn't have to be
cached in a local variable.

This patch shouldn't introduce any behavior difference.
