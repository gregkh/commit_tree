virtio: defer config changed notifications

Defer config changed notifications that arrive during
probe/scan/freeze/restore.

This will allow drivers to set DRIVER_OK earlier, without worrying about
racing with config change interrupts.

This change will also benefit old hypervisors (before 2009)
that send interrupts without checking DRIVER_OK: previously,
the callback could race with driver-specific initialization.

This will also help simplify drivers.
