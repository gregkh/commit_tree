MAINTAINERS: remove non existent files

Inspired by some recent cleanups in MAINTAINERS the following files (F:)
cannot be found any more in the tree:

* arch/arm/mach-s5pv210/mach-aquila.c
* arch/arm/mach-s5pv210/mach-goni.c

  Those two got removed in commit 28c8331d386a ("ARM: S5PV210: Remove
  support for board files").

* drivers/rtc/rtc-sec.c

  A MAINTAINERS fix was attempted in November 2012, but dismissed as
  rtc-sec.c was still being worked on.  Alas, it's still not there.
