nfsd: don't keep a pointer to the lease in nfs4_file

Now that we don't need to pass in an actual lease pointer to
vfs_setlease on unlock, we can stop tracking a pointer to the lease in
the nfs4_file.

Switch all of the places that check the fi_lease to check fi_deleg_file
instead. We always set that at the same time so it will have the same
semantics.
