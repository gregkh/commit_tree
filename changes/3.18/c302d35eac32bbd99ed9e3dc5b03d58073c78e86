Revert duplicate "PCI: pciehp: Prevent NULL dereference during probe"

This reverts bceee4a97eb5 ("PCI: pciehp: Prevent NULL dereference during
probe") because it was accidentally applied twice:

  62e4492c3063 ("PCI: Prevent NULL dereference during pciehp probe")
  bceee4a97eb5 ("PCI: pciehp: Prevent NULL dereference during probe")

Revert the latter to dispose of the duplicated code block.
