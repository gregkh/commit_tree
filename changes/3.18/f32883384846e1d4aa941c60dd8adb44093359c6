fs/ocfs2/cluster/netdebug.c: use seq_open_private() not seq_open()

Reduce boilerplate code by using seq_open_private() instead of seq_open()

Note that the code in and using sc_common_open() has been quite
extensively changed.  Not least because there was a latent memory leak in
the code as was: if sc_common_open() failed, the previously allocated
buffer was not freed.
