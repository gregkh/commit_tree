Fix thinko in iov_iter_single_seg_count

The branches of the if (i->type & ITER_BVEC) statement in
iov_iter_single_seg_count() are the wrong way around; if ITER_BVEC is
clear then we use i->bvec, when we should be using i->iov.  This fixes
it.

In my case, the symptom that this caused was that a KVM guest doing
filesystem operations on a virtual disk would result in one of qemu's
threads on the host going into an infinite loop in
generic_perform_write().  The loop would hit the copied == 0 case and
call iov_iter_single_seg_count() to reduce the number of bytes to try
to process, but because of the error, iov_iter_single_seg_count()
would just return i->count and the loop made no progress and continued
forever.
