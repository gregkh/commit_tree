isdn/capi: prevent index overrun from command_2_index()

The result of the function command_2_index() is used to index two
arrays mnames[] and cpars[] with max. index 0x4e but in its current
form that function can produce results up to 3*(0x9+0x9)+0x7f =
0xb5.
Fix by clamping all result values potentially overrunning the arrays
to zero which is already handled as an invalid value.

Re-spotted with Coverity.
