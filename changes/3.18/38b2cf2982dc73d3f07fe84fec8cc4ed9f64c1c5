net: pktgen: packet bursting via skb->xmit_more

This patch demonstrates the effect of delaying update of HW tailptr.
(based on earlier patch by Jesper)

burst=1 is the default. It sends one packet with xmit_more=false
burst=2 sends one packet with xmit_more=true and
        2nd copy of the same packet with xmit_more=false
burst=3 sends two copies of the same packet with xmit_more=true and
        3rd copy with xmit_more=false

Performance with ixgbe (usec 30):
burst=1  tx:9.2 Mpps
burst=2  tx:13.5 Mpps
burst=3  tx:14.5 Mpps full 10G line rate
