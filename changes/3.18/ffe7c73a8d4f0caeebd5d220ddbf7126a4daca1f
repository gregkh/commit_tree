drm: Fix race between drm_vblank_off() and drm_queue_vblank_event()

Currently it's possible that the following will happen:
1. drm_wait_vblank() calls drm_vblank_get()
2. drm_vblank_off() gets called
3. drm_wait_vblank() calls drm_queue_vblank_event() which
   adds the event to the queue event though vblank interrupts
   are currently disabled (and may not be re-enabled ever again).

To fix the problem, add another vblank->enabled check into
drm_queue_vblank_event().

drm_vblank_off() holds event_lock around the vblank disable,
so no further locking needs to be added to drm_queue_vblank_event().
vblank disable from another source is not possible since
drm_wait_vblank() already holds a vblank reference.
