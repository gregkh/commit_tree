IB/iser: Use iser_warn instead of BUG_ON in iser_conn_release

In case iscsid was violently killed (SIGKILL) during its error
recovery stage, we may never get a connection teardown sequence for
some of the old connections.  No harm done, but when we try to unload
the module we will need to cleanup all these connections.  So we
actually may end-up here - so it's not a BUG_ON(), just give a relaxed
warning that this happened and continue with normal unload.  BUG_ON()
will cause segfault on module_exit and we don't want that.
