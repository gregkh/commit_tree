tracing: Robustify wait loop

The pending nested sleep debugging triggered on the potential stale
TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE in this code.

While there, fix the loop such that we won't revert to a while(1)
yield() 'spin' loop if we ever get a spurious wakeup.

And fix the actual issue by properly terminating the 'wait' loop by
setting TASK_RUNNING.
