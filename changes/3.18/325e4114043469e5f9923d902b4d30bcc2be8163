powerpc/powernv: Properly fix LPC debugfs endianness

Endian is hard, especially when I designed a stupid FW interface, and
I should know better... oh well, this is attempt #2 at fixing this
properly. This time it seems to work with all access sizes and I
can run my flashing tool (which exercises all sort of access sizes
and types to access the SPI controller in the BMC) just fine.
