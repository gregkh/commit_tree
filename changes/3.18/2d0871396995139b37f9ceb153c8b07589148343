builddeb: put the dbg files into the correct directory

Since the conversion of objtree to use relative pathnames (commit
7e1c04779e, "kbuild: Use relative path for $(objtree)"), the debug
info files have been ending up in /debian/dbgtmp/ in the regular
linux-image package instead of the debug files package. Fix up the
paths so that the debug files end up in the -dbg package.

This is based on a similar patch by Darrick.
