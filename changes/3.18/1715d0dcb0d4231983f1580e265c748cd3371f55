KVM: x86: Wrong assertion on paging_tmpl.h

Even after the recent fix, the assertion on paging_tmpl.h is triggered.
Apparently, the assertion wants to check that the PAE is always set on
long-mode, but does it in incorrect way.  Note that the assertion is not
enabled unless the code is debugged by defining MMU_DEBUG.
