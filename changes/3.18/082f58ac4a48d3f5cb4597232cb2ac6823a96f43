target: Fix queue full status NULL pointer for SCF_TRANSPORT_TASK_SENSE

During temporary resource starvation at lower transport layer, command
is placed on queue full retry path, which expose this problem.  The TCM
queue full handling of SCF_TRANSPORT_TASK_SENSE currently sends the same
cmd twice to lower layer.  The 1st time led to cmd normal free path.
The 2nd time cause Null pointer access.

This regression bug was originally introduced v3.1-rc code in the
following commit:
