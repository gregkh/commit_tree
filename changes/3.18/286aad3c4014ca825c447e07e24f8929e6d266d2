net: bpf: be friendly to kmemcheck

Reported by Mikulas Patocka, kmemcheck currently barks out a
false positive since we don't have special kmemcheck annotation
for bitfields used in bpf_prog structure.

We currently have jited:1, len:31 and thus when accessing len
while CONFIG_KMEMCHECK enabled, kmemcheck throws a warning that
we're reading uninitialized memory.

As we don't need the whole bit universe for pages member, we
can just split it to u16 and use a bool flag for jited instead
of a bitfield.
