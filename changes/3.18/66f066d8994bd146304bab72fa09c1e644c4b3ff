perf callchain: Create an address space per thread

The unw_addr_space_t in libunwind represents an address space to be used
for stack unwinding.  It doesn't need to be create/destory everytime to
unwind callchain (as in get_entries) and can have a same lifetime as
thread (unless exec called).

So move the address space construction/destruction logic to the thread
lifetime handling functions.  This is a preparation to enable caching in
the unwind library.

Note that it saves unw_addr_space_t object using thread__set_priv().  It
seems currently only used by perf trace and perf kvm stat commands which
don't use callchain.
