ARM: dts: socfpga: unuse the slot-node and deprecate the supports-highspeed for
dw-mmc

dw-mmc controller can support multiple slots.
But, there are no use-cases anywhere. So we don't need to support the
slot-node for dw-mmc controller.
And "supports-highspeed" property in dw-mmc is deprecated.
"supports-highspeed" property can be replaced with "cap-sd/mmc-highspeed".
