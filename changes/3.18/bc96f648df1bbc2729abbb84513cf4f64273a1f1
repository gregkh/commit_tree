xen-netback: make feature-rx-notify mandatory

Frontends that do not provide feature-rx-notify may stall because
netback depends on the notification from frontend to wake the guest Rx
thread (even if can_queue is false).

This could be fixed but feature-rx-notify was introduced in 2006 and I
am not aware of any frontends that do not implement this.
