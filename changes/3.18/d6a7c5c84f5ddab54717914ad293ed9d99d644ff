arm: omap: irq: get rid of ifdef hack

we don't need the ifdef if we have omap_nr_pending
telling us how many pending registers we have
on current platform. This solves a possible
problem where we could try to handle bogus
interrupts on OMAP2 and OMAP3 if using single
zImage kernel, because we would end up reading
the following pending FIQ register.
