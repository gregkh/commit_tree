block: Add a disk flag to block integrity profile

So far we have relied on the app tag size to determine whether a disk
has been formatted with T10 protection information or not. However, not
all target devices provide application tag storage.

Add a flag to the block integrity profile that indicates whether the
disk has been formatted with protection information.
