arm/arm64: KVM: map MMIO regions at creation time

There is really no point in faulting in memory regions page by page
if they are not backed by demand paged system RAM but by a linear
passthrough mapping of a host MMIO region. So instead, detect such
regions at setup time and install the mappings for the backing all
at once.
