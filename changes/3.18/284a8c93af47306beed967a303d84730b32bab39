rcu: Per-CPU operation cleanups to rcu_*_qs() functions

The rcu_bh_qs(), rcu_preempt_qs(), and rcu_sched_qs() functions use
old-style per-CPU variable access and write to ->passed_quiesce even
if it is already set.  This commit therefore updates to use the new-style
per-CPU variable access functions and avoids the spurious writes.
This commit also eliminates the "cpu" argument to these functions because
they are always invoked on the indicated CPU.
