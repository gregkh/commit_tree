ALSA: hda - move DELL_WMI_MIC_MUTE_LED to the tail in the quirk chain

We have one more Dell machine needs DELL_WMI_MIC_MUTE_LED quirk, but
the machine uses alc293 instead of alc255. So if
DELL_WMI_MIC_MUTE_LED still chain ALC255_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE,
the machine can't use this quirk.

To change this situation, let the DELL_WMI_MIC_MUTE_LED to be a
standalone quirk, and let other quirks chain it.

After this change, this quirk can be chained to any existing quirks,
and as a result, it is possible that this quirk is applied to
a non-Dell machine or a Dell machine without mic mute led on it, but
it is still safe since alc_fixup_dell_wmi() will return an error in
these situations.

And remove the quirk for machine with subsystem id 0x6010 and 0x601f,
these two machines will fall back to the quirk
ALC255_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE-->ALC255_FIXUP_HEADSET_MODE-->
ALC255_FIXUP_DELL_WMI_MIC_MUTE_LED through pin_fixup_tbl[].
