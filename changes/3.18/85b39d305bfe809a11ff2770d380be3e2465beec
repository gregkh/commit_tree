rcu: Uninline rcu_read_lock_held()

This commit uninlines rcu_read_lock_held(). According to "size vmlinux"
this saves 28549 in .text:

	- 5541731 3014560 14757888 23314179
	+ 5513182 3026848 14757888 23297918

Note: it looks as if the data grows by 12288 bytes but this is not true,
it does not actually grow. But .data starts with ALIGN(THREAD_SIZE) and
since .text shrinks the padding grows, and thus .data grows too as it
seen by /bin/size. diff System.map:

	- ffffffff81510000 D _sdata
	- ffffffff81510000 D init_thread_union
	+ ffffffff81509000 D _sdata
	+ ffffffff8150c000 D init_thread_union

Perhaps we can change vmlinux.lds.S to .data itself, so that /bin/size
can't "wrongly" report that .data grows if .text shinks.
