Input: automatically set EV_ABS bit in input_set_abs_params

Let's automatically set EV_ABS bit in device's event type list when calling
input_set_abs_params() so that drivers do not have to do it explicitly.

These calls are never in a hot paths so we won't lose much time by setting
the same bit several times.
