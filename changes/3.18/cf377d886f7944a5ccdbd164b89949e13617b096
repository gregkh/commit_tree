net: bcmgenet: fix off-by-one in incrementing read pointer

Commit b629be5c8399d7c423b92135eb43a86c924d1cbc ("net: bcmgenet: check
harder for out of memory conditions") moved the increment of the local
read pointer *before* reading from the hardware descriptor using
dmadesc_get_length_status(), which creates an off-by-one situation.

Fix this by moving again the read_ptr increment after we have read the
hardware descriptor to get both the control block and the read pointer
back in sync.
