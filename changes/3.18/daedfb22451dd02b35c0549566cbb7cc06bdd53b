net: filter: split filter.h and expose eBPF to user space

allow user space to generate eBPF programs

uapi/linux/bpf.h: eBPF instruction set definition

linux/filter.h: the rest

This patch only moves macro definitions, but practically it freezes existing
eBPF instruction set, though new instructions can still be added in the future.

These eBPF definitions cannot go into uapi/linux/filter.h, since the names
may conflict with existing applications.

Full eBPF ISA description is in Documentation/networking/filter.txt
