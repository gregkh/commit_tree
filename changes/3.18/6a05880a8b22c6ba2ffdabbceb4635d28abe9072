net: ethernet: Remove superfluous ether_setup after alloc_etherdev

There is no need to call ether_setup after alloc_ethdev since it was
already called there.

Follow commits c706471b2601 ("net: axienet: remove unnecessary
ether_setup after alloc_etherdev") and 3c87dcbfb36c ("net: ll_temac:
Remove unnecessary ether_setup after alloc_etherdev") and fix the
pattern in all remaining ethernet drivers.
