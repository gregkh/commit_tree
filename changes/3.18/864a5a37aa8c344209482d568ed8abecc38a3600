staging: vt6655: card.c change BBvCalculateParameter to vnt_get_phy_field

Using vnt_get_phy_field means the values are not in the
correct write order the lower word and the upper word need
to be swapped over for an u32 write out.

Rather create another data variable to manipulate this structure.
Create a new union vnt_phy_field_swap with struct vnt_phy_field,
the u16 word swap and the u32 write out.
