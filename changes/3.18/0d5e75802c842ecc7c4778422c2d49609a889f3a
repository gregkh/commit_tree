ipc: resolve shadow warnings

Resolve some shadow warnings produced in W=2 builds by changing the name
of some parameters and local variables.  Change instances of "s64"
because that clashes with the well-known typedef.  Also change a local
variable with the name "up" because that clashes with the name of of the
"up" function for semaphores.  These are hazards so eliminate the
hazards by renaming them.
