megaraid_sas: Fix LD/VF affiliation parsing

The following patch for megaraid_sas fixes the LD/VF affiliation policy parsing
code to account for LD targetId's and Hidden LD's (not yet affiliated with any
Virtual Functions).  This also breaks megasas_get_ld_vf_affiliation() into 2
separate functions:  megasas_get_ld_vf_affiliation_111() and
megasas_get_ld_Vf_affiliation_12() to reduce indentation levels.
