tg3: fix ring init when there are more TX than RX channels

If TX channels are set to 4 and RX channels are set to less than 4,
using ethtool -L, the driver will try to initialize more RX channels
than it has allocated, causing an oops.

This fix only initializes the RX ring if it has been allocated.
