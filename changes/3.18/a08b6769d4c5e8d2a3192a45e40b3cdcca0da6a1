perf/x86: Fix section mismatch in split uncore driver

The new split Intel uncore driver code that recently went
into tip added a section mismatch, which the build process
complains about.

uncore_pmu_register() can be called from uncore_pci_probe,()
which is not __init and can be called from pci driver ->probe.
I'm not fully sure if it's actually possible to call the probe
function later, but it seems safer to mark uncore_pmu_register
not __init.

This also fixes the warning.
