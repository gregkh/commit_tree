perf tools: Fix perf record as non root with kptr_restrict == 1

Currently perf record always errors out when you run it as non-root with
kptr_restrict == 1, which is often the default.

Make it only warn instead and fix the kernel resolve code to not
segfault later. Profiling works still fine, except kernel symbols are
not resolved.
