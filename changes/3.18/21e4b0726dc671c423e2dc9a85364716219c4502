rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Move driver from staging to regular tree

This driver was entered into staging a few cycles ago because there was
not time to integrate the Realtek version into the support routines in
the kernel. Now that there is an effort to converg the code base from Linux
and the Realtek repo, it is time to move this driver. In addition, all the
updates included in the 06/28/2014 version of the Realtek drivers are
included here.

With this change, it will be necessary to delete the staging driver. That
will be handled in a separate patch. As it impacts the staging tree, such a
patch is sent to a different destination.
