x86, boot, kaslr: Fix nuisance warning on 32-bit builds

Building 32-bit threw a warning on kASLR enabled builds:

arch/x86/boot/compressed/aslr.c: In function ‘mem_avoid_overlap’:
arch/x86/boot/compressed/aslr.c:198:17: warning: cast from pointer to integer of different size [-Wpointer-to-int-cast]
   avoid.start = (u64)ptr;
                 ^

This fixes the warning; unsigned long should have been used here.
