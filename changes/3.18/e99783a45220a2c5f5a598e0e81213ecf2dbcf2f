mmc: sdhci: handle busy-end interrupt during command

It is fully legal for a controller to start handling busy-end interrupt
before it has signaled that the command has completed. So make sure
we do things in the proper order, Or it results that command interrupt
is ignored so it can cause unexpected operations. This is founded at some
toshiba emmc with the bellow warning.

"mmc0: Got command interrupt 0x00000001 even though
no command operation was in progress."

This issue has been also reported by Youssef TRIKI:
It is not specific to Toshiba devices, and happens with eMMC devices
as well as SD card which support Auto-CMD12 rather than CMD23.

Also, similar patch is submitted by:
Gwendal Grignou <gwendal@chromium.org>

Changes since v1:
 Fixed conflict with the next of git.linaro.org/people/ulf.hansson/mmc.git
 and Tested if issue is fixed again.
