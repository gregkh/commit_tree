ahci: disable MSI instead of NCQ on Samsung pci-e SSDs on macbooks

Samsung pci-e SSDs on macbooks failed miserably on NCQ commands, so
67809f85d31e ("ahci: disable NCQ on Samsung pci-e SSDs on macbooks")
disabled NCQ on them.  It turns out that NCQ is fine as long as MSI is
not used, so let's turn off MSI and leave NCQ on.
