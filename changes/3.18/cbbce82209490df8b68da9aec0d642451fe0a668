SCHED: add some "wait..on_bit...timeout()" interfaces.

In commit c1221321b7c25b53204447cff9949a6d5a7ddddc
   sched: Allow wait_on_bit_action() functions to support a timeout

I suggested that a "wait_on_bit_timeout()" interface would not meet my
need.  This isn't true - I was just over-engineering.

Including a 'private' field in wait_bit_key instead of a focused
"timeout" field was just premature generalization.  If some other
use is ever found, it can be generalized or added later.

So this patch renames "private" to "timeout" with a meaning "stop
waiting when "jiffies" reaches or passes "timeout",
and adds two of the many possible wait..bit..timeout() interfaces:

wait_on_page_bit_killable_timeout(), which is the one I want to use,
and out_of_line_wait_on_bit_timeout() which is a reasonably general
example.  Others can be added as needed.
