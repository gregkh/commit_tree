ASoC: ssm2518: Cleanup manual bias level transitions

Since the ASoC core now takes care of setting the bias level to
SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF when removing the CODEC there is no need to do it manually
anymore either.

The manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF at the end of CODEC probe()
can also be removed as the CODEC is already in OFF state at this point.
