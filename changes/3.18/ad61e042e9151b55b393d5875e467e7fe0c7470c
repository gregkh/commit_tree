crypto: sha-mb - SHA1 multibuffer job manager and glue code

This patch introduces the multi-buffer job manager which is responsible
for submitting scatter-gather buffers from several SHA1 jobs to the
multi-buffer algorithm.  It also contains the flush routine to that's
called by the crypto daemon to complete the job when no new jobs arrive
before the deadline of maximum latency of a SHA1 crypto job.

The SHA1 multi-buffer crypto algorithm is defined and initialized in
this patch.
