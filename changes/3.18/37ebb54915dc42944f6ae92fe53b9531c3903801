usb: hub: rename khubd to hub_wq in documentation and comments

USB hub has started to use a workqueue instead of kthread. Let's update
the documentation and comments here and there.

This patch mostly just replaces "khubd" with "hub_wq". There are only few
exceptions where the whole sentence was updated. These more complicated
changes can be found in the following files:

	   Documentation/usb/hotplug.txt
	   drivers/net/usb/usbnet.c
	   drivers/usb/core/hcd.c
	   drivers/usb/host/ohci-hcd.c
	   drivers/usb/host/xhci.c
