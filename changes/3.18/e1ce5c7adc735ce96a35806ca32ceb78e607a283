clocksource: arm_arch_timer: Consolidate arch_timer_evtstrm_enable

The arch_timer_evtstrm_enable hooks in arm and arm64 are substantially
similar, the only difference being a CONFIG_COMPAT-conditional section
which is relevant only for arm64.  Copy the arm64 version to the
driver, removing the arch-specific hooks.
