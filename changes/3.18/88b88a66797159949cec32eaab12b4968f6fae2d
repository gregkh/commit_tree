f2fs: support atomic writes

This patch introduces a very limited functionality for atomic write support.
In order to support atomic write, this patch adds two ioctls:
 o F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE
 o F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE

The database engine should be aware of the following sequence.
1. open
 -> ioctl(F2FS_IOC_START_ATOMIC_WRITE);
2. writes
  : all the written data will be treated as atomic pages.
3. commit
 -> ioctl(F2FS_IOC_COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE);
  : this flushes all the data blocks to the disk, which will be shown all or
  nothing by f2fs recovery procedure.
4. repeat to #2.

The IO pattens should be:

  ,- START_ATOMIC_WRITE                  ,- COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE
 CP | D D D D D D | FSYNC | D D D D | FSYNC ...
                      `- COMMIT_ATOMIC_WRITE
