MIPS: Netlogic: handle modular AHCI builds

Commits a951440971d0 ("MIPS: Netlogic: Support for XLP3XX on-chip SATA")
and fedfcb1137d2 ("MIPS: Netlogic: XLP9XX on-chip SATA support") added
ahci-init and ahci-init-xlp2 as objects to build when CONFIG_SATA_AHCI
is enabled.

If CONFIG_SATA_AHCI is made modular, these two files will also get built
as modules (obj-m), which will result in the following linking failure:

ERROR: "nlm_set_pic_extra_ack" [arch/mips/netlogic/xlp/ahci-init.ko]
undefined!
ERROR: "nlm_io_base" [arch/mips/netlogic/xlp/ahci-init.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "nlm_nodes" [arch/mips/netlogic/xlp/ahci-init-xlp2.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "nlm_set_pic_extra_ack"
[arch/mips/netlogic/xlp/ahci-init-xlp2.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "xlp_socdev_to_node" [arch/mips/netlogic/xlp/ahci-init-xlp2.ko]
undefined!
ERROR: "nlm_io_base" [arch/mips/netlogic/xlp/ahci-init-xlp2.ko]
undefined!

Just check whether CONFIG_SATA_AHCI is defined for this build, and if
that is the case, add these objects to the list of built-in object
files.
