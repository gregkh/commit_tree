KVM: x86: Emulator does not decode clflush well

Currently, all group15 instructions are decoded as clflush (e.g., mfence,
xsave).  In addition, the clflush instruction requires no prefix (66/f2/f3)
would exist. If prefix exists it may encode a different instruction (e.g.,
clflushopt).

Creating a group for clflush, and different group for each prefix.

This has been the case forever, but the next patch needs the cflush group
in order to fix a bug introduced in 3.17.
