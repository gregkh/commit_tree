thermal: exynos: remove redundant pdata checks from exynos_tmu_initialize()

Remove runtime checks for pdata sanity from exynos_tmu_initialize().

The current values hardcoded in pdata will never trigger the checks
and checking itself is not proper.  The checks in question are done
at runtime in a production code for data that is hardcoded inside
driver during development time and later it doesn't change.  Such
data should be verified during development and review time (i.e. by
a script parsing relevant data from exynos_tmu_data.c, one can also
argue that verification to be done is so simple that the review by
a maintainer should be enough).

There should be no functional changes caused by this patch.
