drm/nouveau/nv50/disp: Fix modeset on G94

Commit 1dce6264045cd23e9c07574ed0bb31c7dce9354f introduced a regression
spotted on several G94 (FDObz #85160). This device seems to expect the
vblank period to be set after setting scale instead of before.

V2: shove this in a separate function

This is a candidate bug-fix for 3.18
