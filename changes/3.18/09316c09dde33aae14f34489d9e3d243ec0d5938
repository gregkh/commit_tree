mm/balloon_compaction: add vmstat counters and kpageflags bit

Always mark pages with PageBalloon even if balloon compaction is disabled
and expose this mark in /proc/kpageflags as KPF_BALLOON.

Also this patch adds three counters into /proc/vmstat: "balloon_inflate",
"balloon_deflate" and "balloon_migrate".  They accumulate balloon
activity.  Current size of balloon is (balloon_inflate - balloon_deflate)
pages.

All generic balloon code now gathered under option CONFIG_MEMORY_BALLOON.
It should be selected by ballooning driver which wants use this feature.
Currently virtio-balloon is the only user.
