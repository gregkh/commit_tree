rcu: Replace flush_signals() with WARN_ON(signal_pending())

Currently, when RCU awakens from a wait_event_interruptible() that
might have awakened prematurely, it does a flush_signals(). This is
done on the off-chance that someone figured out how to deliver a signal
to a kthread, which is supposed to be impossible.  Given that this
is supposed to be impossible, this commit changes the flush_signals()
calls into WARN_ON(signal_pending()).
