drm/i915: vma/ppgtt lifetime rules

VMAs should take a reference of the address space they use.

Now, when the fd is closed, it will release the ref that the context was
holding, but it will still be referenced by any vmas that are still
active.

ppgtt_release() should then only be called when the last thing referencing
it releases the ref, and it can just call the base cleanup and free the
ppgtt.

Note that with this we will extend the lifetime of ppgtts which
contain shared objects. But all the non-shared objects will get
removed as soon as they drop of the active list and for the shared
ones the shrinker can eventually reap them. Since we currently can't
evict ppgtt pagetables either I don't think that temporary leak is
important.
