x86,kvm,vmx: Preserve CR4 across VM entry

CR4 isn't constant; at least the TSD and PCE bits can vary.

TBH, treating CR0 and CR3 as constant scares me a bit, too, but it looks
like it's correct.

This adds a branch and a read from cr4 to each vm entry.  Because it is
extremely likely that consecutive entries into the same vcpu will have
the same host cr4 value, this fixes up the vmcs instead of restoring cr4
after the fact.  A subsequent patch will add a kernel-wide cr4 shadow,
reducing the overhead in the common case to just two memory reads and a
branch.
