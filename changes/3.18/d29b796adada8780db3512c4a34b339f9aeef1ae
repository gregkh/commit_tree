net/mlx5_core: Use hardware registers description header file

Add an auto generated header file that describes hardware registers along with
set of macros that set/get values. The macros do static checks to avoid
overflow, handle endianess, and overall provide a clean way to code commands.
Currently the header file is small and we will add structs as we make use of
the macros.
A few commands were removed from the commands enum since they are not supported
currently and will be added when support is available.
