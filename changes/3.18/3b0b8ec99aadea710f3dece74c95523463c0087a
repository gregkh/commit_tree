ARM: spear: Remove references to PLAT_SPEAR_SINGLE

The Kconfig symbol PLAT_SPEAR_SINGLE briefly appeared during the v3.10
development cycle. It was removed in a merge commit before v3.10. A few
references to it were left in the tree, probably because they didn't
generate merge conflicts. Whatever it was, they're useless now and can
safely be removed.
