fou: eliminate IPv4,v6 specific GRO functions

This patch removes fou[46]_gro_receive and fou[46]_gro_complete
functions. The v4 or v6 variants were chosen for the UDP offloads
based on the address family of the socket this is not necessary
or correct. Alternatively, this patch adds is_ipv6 to napi_gro_skb.
This is set in udp6_gro_receive and unset in udp4_gro_receive. In
fou_gro_receive the value is used to select the correct inet_offloads
for the protocol of the outer IP header.
