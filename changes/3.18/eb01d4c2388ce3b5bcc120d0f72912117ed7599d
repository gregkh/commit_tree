cxl: Fix PSL error due to duplicate segment table entries

In certain circumstances the PSL (Power Service Layer, which provides
translation services for CXL hardware) can send an interrupt for a
segment miss that the kernel has already handled. This can happen if
multiple translations for the same segment are queued in the PSL before
the kernel has restarted the first translation.

The CXL driver does not expect this situation and does not check if a
segment had already been handled. This could cause a duplicate segment
table entry which in turn caused a PSL error taking down the card.

This patch fixes the issue by checking for existing entries in the
segment table that match the segment we are trying to insert, so as to
avoid inserting duplicate entries.
