drm/i915: Don't dereference fb when disabling primary plane

During driver init we may not have a valid framebuffer for the primary
plane even though the plane is enabled due to failed BIOS fb takeover.
This means we have to avoid dereferencing the fb in
.update_primary_plane() when disabling the plane.

caused a regression by trying to look up the pixel format before we can

since the rotation patches originally predate the change to the primary
plane code that calls .update_primary_plane() also when disabling the
plane:
