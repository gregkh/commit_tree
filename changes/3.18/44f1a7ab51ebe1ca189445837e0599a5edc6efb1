Bluetooth: Use L2CAP resume callback to call smp_distribute_keys

There's no need to export the smp_distribute_keys() function since the
resume callback is called in the same scenario. This patch makes the
smp_notify_keys function private (at the same time moving it higher up
in smp.c to avoid forward declarations) and adds a resume callback for
SMP to call it from there instead.
