drbd: compute the end before rb_insert_augmented()

Commit 98683650 "Merge branch 'drbd-8.4_ed6' into
for-3.8-drivers-drbd-8.4_ed6" switches to the new augment API, but the
new API requires that the tree is augmented before rb_insert_augmented()
is called, which is missing.

So we add the augment-code to drbd_insert_interval() when it travels the
tree up to down before rb_insert_augmented().  See the example in
include/linux/interval_tree_generic.h or Documentation/rbtree.txt.

drbd_insert_interval() may cancel the insertion when traveling, in this
case, the just added augment-code does nothing before cancel since the
@this node is already in the subtrees in this case.
