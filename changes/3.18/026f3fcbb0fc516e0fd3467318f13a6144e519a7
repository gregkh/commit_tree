usb: core: TPL should apply for both OTG and EH

According to On-The-Go and Embedded Host Supplement to the USB Revision
2.0 Specification, the targeted hosts (non-PC hosts) include both
embedded hosts and otg, and each targeted host product defines the
set of supported peripherals on a TPL (Targeted Peripheral List). So,
TPL should apply for both OTG and embedded host, and the otg support is
not a must for embedded host.

The TPL support feature will only be effect when CONFIG_USB_OTG_WHITELIST
has been chosen and hcd->tpl_support flag is set, it can avoid the enumeration
fails problem for the user who chooses CONFIG_USB_OTG_WHITELIST wrongly.
