Btrfs: make defragment work with nodatacow option

Btrfs defragment will utilize COW feature, which means this
did not work for nodatacow option, this problem was detected
by xfstests generic/018 with nodatacow mount option.

Fix this problem by forcing cow for a extent with state
@EXTETN_DEFRAG setting.
