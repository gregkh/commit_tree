nfsd4: clarify how grace period ends

The grace period is ended in two steps--first userland is notified that
the grace period is now long enough that any clients who have not yet
reclaimed can be safely forgotten, then we flip the switch that forbids
reclaims and allows new opens.  I had to think a bit to convince myself
that the ordering was right here.  Document it.
