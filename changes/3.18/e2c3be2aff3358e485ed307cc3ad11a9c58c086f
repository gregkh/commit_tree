[media] s5p-mfc: Fix sparse errors in the MFC driver

The following error: "error: incompatible types in conditional expression
(different base types)" was reported multiple times for the s5p-mfc
driver. This error was caused by two macro definitions - s5p_mfc_hw_call
(in s5p_mfc_common.h) and WRITEL (in s5p_mfc_opr_v6.c).

In the former case the macro assumed that all ops return a value, but some
ops return void. The solution to this problem was the addition of a
s5p_mfc_hw_call_void macro.

In the latter case the macro used the ?: construction to check whether
the address is non zero. This is not necessary after the driver left the
development and debugging cycle, so the READL and WRITEL macros were
removed.
