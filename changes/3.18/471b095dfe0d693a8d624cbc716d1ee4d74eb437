firmware_class: make sure fw requests contain a name

An empty firmware request name will trigger warnings when building
device names. Make sure this is caught earlier and rejected.

The warning was visible via the test_firmware.ko module interface:

echo -ne "\x00" > /sys/devices/virtual/misc/test_firmware/trigger_request
