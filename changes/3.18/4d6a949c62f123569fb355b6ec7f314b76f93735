sh_eth: Fix skb alloc size and alignment adjust rule.

In the current driver, allocation size of skb does not care the alignment
adjust after allocation.
And also, in the current implementation, buffer alignment method by
sh_eth_set_receive_align function has a bug that this function displace
buffer start address forcedly when the alignment is corrected.
In the result, tail of the skb will exceed allocated area and kernel panic
will be occurred.
This patch fix this issue.
