kbuild: handle multi-objs dependency appropriately

The comment in scripts/Makefile.build says as follows:

  We would rather have a list of rules like
        foo.o: $(foo-objs)
  but that's not so easy, so we rather make all composite objects depend
  on the set of all their parts

This commit makes it possible!

For example, assume a Makefile like this

  obj-m = foo.o bar.o
  foo-objs := foo1.o foo2.o
  bar-objs := bar1.o bar2.o

Without this patch, foo.o depends on all of
foo1.o foo2.o bar1.o bar2.o.
It looks funny that foo.o is regenerated when bar1.c is updated.

Now we can handle the dependency of foo.o and bar.o separately.
