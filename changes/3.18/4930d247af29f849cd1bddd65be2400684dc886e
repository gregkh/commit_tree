ARM: at91/tclib: move initialization from alloc to probe

Move resource retrieval from atmel_tc_alloc to tc_probe to avoid lately
reporting resource related issues when a TC block user request a TC block.

Moreover, resources retrieval are usually done in the probe function,
thus moving them add some consistency with other drivers.

Initialization is done once, ie not every time a tc block is requested.
If it fails, the device is not appended to the list of tc blocks.

Furhermore, the device id is retrieved at probe as well, avoiding parsing
DT every time the user requests of tc block.
