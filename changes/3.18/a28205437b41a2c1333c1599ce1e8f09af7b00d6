net: dsa: add includes for ethtool and phy_fixed definitions

net/dsa/slave.c uses functions and structures declared in phy_fixed.h
but does not explicitely include it, while dsa.h needs structure
declarations for 'struct ethtool_wolinfo' and 'struct ethtool_eee', fix
those by including the correct header files.
