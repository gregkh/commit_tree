KVM: emulator: fix error code for __linearize

The error code for #GP and #SS is zero when the segment is used to
access an operand or an instruction.  It is only non-zero when
a segment register is being loaded; for limit checks this means
cases such as:

* for #GP, when RIP is beyond the limit on a far call (before the first
instruction is executed).  We do not implement this check, but it
would be in em_jmp_far/em_call_far.

* for #SS, if the new stack overflows during an inter-privilege-level
call to a non-conforming code segment.  We do not implement stack
switching at all.

So use an error code of zero.
