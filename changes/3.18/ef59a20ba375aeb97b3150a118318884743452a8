ARM: 8216/1: xscale: correct auxiliary register in suspend/resume

According to the manuals I have, XScale auxiliary register should be
reached with opc_2 = 1 instead of crn = 1. cpu_xscale_proc_init
correctly uses c1, c0, 1 arguments, but cpu_xscale_do_suspend and
cpu_xscale_do_resume use c1, c1, 0. Correct suspend/resume functions to
also use c1, c0, 1.

The issue was primarily noticed thanks to qemu reporing "unsupported
instruction" on the pxa suspend path. Confirmed in PXA210/250 and PXA255
XScale Core manuals and in PXA270 and PXA320 Developers Guides.

Harware tested by me on tosa (pxa255). Robert confirmed on pxa270 board.
