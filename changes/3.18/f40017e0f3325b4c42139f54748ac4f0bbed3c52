chipidea: usbmisc_imx: Add USB support for VF610 SoCs

This adds Vybrid VF610 SoC support. The IP is very similar to i.MX6,
however, the non-core registers are spread in two different register
areas. Hence we support multiple instances of the USB misc driver
and add the driver instance to the imx_usbmisc_data structure.
