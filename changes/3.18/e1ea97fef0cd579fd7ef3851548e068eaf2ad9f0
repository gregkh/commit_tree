target/configfs: Remove unnecessary null test

This patch removes the null test on lun_cg. lun_cg is initialized
at the beginning of the function to &lun->lun_group. Since lun_cg is
dereferenced prior to the null test, it must be a valid pointer.

The following Coccinelle script is used for detecting the change:

@r@
expression e,f;
identifier g,y;
statement S1,S2;
@@

*e = &f->g
<+...
 f->y
 ...+>
*if (e != NULL || ...)
 S1 else S2
