tty: vt8500_serial: explicitly calculate base baud rate

Current code relies on the UART clock pre-divisor to be already
configured in the baud rate register. Calculate it in the driver
and set explicitly instead, also return the "real" effective baud
rate, which is generally slightly different from the requested value.

While at this, also ensure that break signal timing is updated when
baud rate changes.
