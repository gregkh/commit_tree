staging: vt6655: Convert DBG_PRT to pr_<level>

DBG_PRT uses are unnecessarily complex.

Convert DBG_PRT msglevel to pr_<level>.
This changes the KERN_<level> type of several uses.
It also enables dynamic_debug for the pr_debug conversions.

This patch can be a prelude to converting these pr_<level>
uses to dev_<level> as appropriate.

Other changes:

Realign arguments of these conversions.
Remove now unused static int msglevel declarations.
Remove now unused DBG_PRT #define.

Compile tested only.
