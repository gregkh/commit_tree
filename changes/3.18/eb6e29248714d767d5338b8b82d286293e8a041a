usb: hub: rename hub_events() to hub_event() and handle only one event there

We would like to convert khubd kthread to a workqueue. As a result hub_events()
will handle only one event per call.

In fact, we could do this already now because there is another cycle in
hub_thread(). It calls hub_events() until hub_event_list is empty.

This patch renames the function to hub_event(), removes the while cycle, and
renames the goto targets from loop* to out*.

When touching the code, it fixes also formatting of dev_err() and dev_dbg()
calls to make checkpatch.pl happy :-)
