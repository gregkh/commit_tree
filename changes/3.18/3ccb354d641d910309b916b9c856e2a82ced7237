vfs: Document the effect of d_revalidate on d_find_alias

d_drop or check_submounts_and_drop called from d_revalidate can result
in renamed directories with child dentries being unhashed.  These
renamed and drop directory dentries can be rehashed after
d_materialise_unique uses d_find_alias to find them.
