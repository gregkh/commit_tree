modpost: reduce visibility of symbols and constify r/o arrays

Internally used symbols of modpost don't need to be externally visible;
make them static. Also constify the string arrays so they resist in the
r/o section instead of being runtime writable.

Those changes lead to a small size reduction as can be seen below:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename

  51765    2224   12416   66405   10365 scripts/mod/modpost.new
