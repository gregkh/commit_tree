gpio: omap: Fix interrupt names

When viewing the /proc/interrupts, there is no information about which
GPIO bank a specific gpio interrupt is hooked on to. This is more than a
bit irritating as such information can esily be provided back to the
user and at times, can be crucial for debug.

So, instead of displaying something like:
31:	0	0  GPIO   0  palmas
32:	0	0  GPIO  27  mmc0

Display the following with appropriate device name:
31:	0	0  4ae10000.gpio   0  palmas
32:	0	0  4805d000.gpio  27  mmc0

This requires that we create irq_chip instance specific for each GPIO
bank which is trivial to achieve.
