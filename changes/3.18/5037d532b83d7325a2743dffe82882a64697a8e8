net: dsa: add Broadcom tag RX/TX handler

Add support for the 4-bytes Broadcom tag that built-in switches such as
the Starfighter 2 might insert when receiving packets, or that we need
to insert while targetting specific switch ports. We use a fake local
EtherType value for this 4-bytes switch tag: ETH_P_BRCMTAG to make sure
we can assign DSA-specific network operations within the DSA drivers.
