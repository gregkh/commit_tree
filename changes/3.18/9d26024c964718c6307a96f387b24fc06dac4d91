MIPS: idle: Remove leftover __pastwait symbol and its references

The __pastwait symbol was only used by the address_is_in_r4k_wait_irqoff
function but this is no longer used since the SMTC removal in commit
b633648c5ad3 ('MIPS: MT: Remove SMTC support'). That symbol also led to
build failures under certain random configuration due to the way the
compiler compiled the r4k_wait_irqoff function. If that function was
called multiple times, the __pastwait symbol was redefined breaking the
build like this:

CHK     include/generated/compile.h
CC      arch/mips/kernel/idle.o
{standard input}: Assembler messages:
{standard input}:527: Error: symbol `__pastwait' is already defined
