openvswitch: Set flow-key members.

This patch adds missing memset which are required to initialize
flow key member. For example for IP flow we need to initialize
ip.frag for all cases.

Found by inspection.

This bug is introduced by commit 0714812134d7dcadeb7ecfbfeb18788aa7e1eaac
("openvswitch: Eliminate memset() from flow_extract").
