powerpc/mm: Add new hash_page_mm()

This adds a new function hash_page_mm() based on the existing hash_page().
This version allows any struct mm to be passed in, rather than assuming
current. This is useful for servicing co-processor faults which are not in the
context of the current running process.

We need to be careful here as the current hash_page() assumes current in a few
places.
