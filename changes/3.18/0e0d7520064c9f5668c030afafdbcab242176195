HID: uhid: simplify report-cb shutdown

The report-query is blocking, so when user-space destroys a device we have
to wake up any blocking kernel context that is currently in the report-cb.
We used some broken correlation between @report_done and @running so far.
Replace it by a much more obvious use.

We now wake up the report-cb if either @report_done or @running is set.
wake_up() and wait_event() serve as implicit barriers (as they always do)
so no need to use smp_rmb/wmb directly.

Note that @report_done is never reset by anyone but the report-cb, thus
it cannot flip twice while we wait for it. And whenever we set @running,
we afterwards synchronously remove the HID device. Therefore, we wait for
all report-cbs to finish before we return. This way, @running can never
flip to true while we wait for it.
