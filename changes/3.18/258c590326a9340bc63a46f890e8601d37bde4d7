toshiba_acpi: Rename hci_raw to tci_raw

The function name hci_raw was used before to reflect
a raw (read/write) call to Toshiba's Hardware
Configuration Interface (HCI), however, since the
introduction of the System Configuration Interface
(SCI), that "name" no longer applies.

This patch changes the name of that function to
tci_raw (for Toshiba Configuration Interface), and
change the comments about it.

Also, the HCI_WORDS definition was changed to TCI_RAW,
to better reflect that we're no longer using pure HCI
calls, but a combination of HCI and SCI, which form
part of the Toshiba Configuration Interface.
