Revert "cgroup: remove redundant variable in cgroup_mount()"

This reverts commit 0c7bf3e8cab7900e17ce7f97104c39927d835469.

If there are child cgroups in the cgroupfs and then we umount it,
the superblock will be destroyed but the cgroup_root will be kept
around. When we mount it again, cgroup_mount() will find this
cgroup_root and allocate a new sb for it.

So with this commit we will be trapped in a dead loop in the case
described above, because kernfs_pin_sb() keeps returning NULL.

Currently I don't see how we can avoid using both pinned_sb and
new_sb, so just revert it.
