locks: set fl_owner for leases to filp instead of current->files

Like flock locks, leases are owned by the file description. Now that the
i_have_this_lease check in __break_lease is gone, we don't actually use
the fl_owner for leases for anything. So, it's now safe to set this more
appropriately to the same value as the fl_file.

While we're at it, fix up the comments over the fl_owner_t definition
since they're rather out of date.
