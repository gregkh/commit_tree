perf symbols: Make sym->end be the first address after the symbol range

To follow vm_area_struct->vm_end convention.

By adhering to the convention that ->end is the first address outside
the symbol's range we can do things like:

	sym->end = start + len;
	len = sym->end - sym->start;

This is also now the convention used for struct map->end, fixing some
off-by-one bugs.
