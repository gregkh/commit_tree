toshiba_acpi: Fix illumination not available on certain models

Some Toshiba models with illumination support set a different
value on the returned codes, thus not allowing the illumination
LED to be registered, where it should be.

This patch removes a check from toshiba_illumination_available
function to allow such models to register the illumination LED.
