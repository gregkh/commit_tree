spi/pxa2xx: Don't use slave_id of dma_slave_config

That field has been deprecated in favour of getting the necessary
information from ACPI/DT.

However, we still need to deal systems that are PCI only (no ACPI to back
up). In order to support such systems, we allow the DMA filter function and
its corresponding parameter via pxa2xx_spi_master platform data. Then when
the pxa2xx_spi_dma_setup() doesn't find the channel via ACPI, it falls back
to use the given filter function.
