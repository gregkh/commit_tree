rtc: max77686: Use ffs() to calculate tm_wday

max77686_rtc_calculate_wday() is used to calculate the day of the week
to be filled in struct rtc_time but that function only calculates the
number of bits shifted.  So the ffs() function can be used to find the
first bit set instead of a special function.
