arm/arm64: KVM: Rename irq_active to irq_queued

We have a special bitmap on the distributor struct to keep track of when
level-triggered interrupts are queued on the list registers.  This was
named irq_active, which is confusing, because the active state of an
interrupt as per the GIC spec is a different thing, not specifically
related to edge-triggered/level-triggered configurations but rather
indicates an interrupt which has been ack'ed but not yet eoi'ed.

Rename the bitmap and the corresponding accessor functions to irq_queued
to clarify what this is actually used for.
