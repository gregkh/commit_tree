drm/i915: Some cleanups for the ppgtt lifetime handling

So when reviewing Michel's patch I've noticed a few things and cleaned
them up:
- The early checks in ppgtt_release are now redundant: The inactive
  list should always be empty now, so we can ditch these checks. Even
  for the aliasing ppgtt (though that's a different confusion) since
  we tear that down after all the objects are gone.
- The ppgtt handling functions are splattered all over. Consolidate
  them in i915_gem_gtt.c, give them OCD prefixes and add wrappers for
  get/put.
- There was a bit a confusion in ppgtt_release about whether it cares
  about the active or inactive list. It should care about them both,
  so augment the WARNINGs to check for both.

There's still create_vm_for_ctx left to do, put that is blocked on the
removal of ppgtt->ctx. Once that's done we can rename it to
i915_ppgtt_create and move it to its siblings for handling ppgtts.

v2: Move the ppgtt checks into the inline get/put functions as
suggested by Chris.

v3: Inline the now redundant ppgtt local variable.
