powerpc: use device_online/offline() instead of cpu_up/down()

In powerpc pseries platform dlpar operations, use device_online() and
device_offline() instead of cpu_up() and cpu_down().

Calling cpu_up/down() directly does not update the cpu device offline
field, which is used to online/offline a cpu from sysfs. Calling
device_online/offline() instead keeps the sysfs cpu online value
correct. The hotplug lock, which is required to be held when calling
device_online/offline(), is already held when dlpar_online/offline_cpu()
are called, since they are called only from cpu_probe|release_store().

This patch fixes errors on phyp (PowerVM) systems that have cpu(s)
added/removed using dlpar operations; without this patch, the
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuN/online nodes do not correctly show the
online state of added/removed cpus.
