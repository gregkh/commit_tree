PCI: Apply _HPX Link Control settings to all devices with a link

Previously we applied _HPX type 2 record Link Control register settings
only to bridges with a subordinate bus.  But it's better to apply them to
all devices with a link because if the subordinate bus has not been
allocated yet, we won't apply settings to the device.

Use pcie_cap_has_lnkctl() to determine whether the device has a Link
Control register instead of looking at dev->subordinate.
