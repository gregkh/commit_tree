i2c: rk3x: Remove unlikely() annotations

Having a transfer more than 32 bits is not all that unlikely.  Remove
the annotation.

The unlikely in the IRQ handler can't gain us much.  It's not in a
loop, so at most it would save 1 instruction per IRQ, which isn't
much.  In fact on the compiler I tested it produced the exact same
code.  Remove it too.
