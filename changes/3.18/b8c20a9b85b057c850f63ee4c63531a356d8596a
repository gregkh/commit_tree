fs/proc/task_mmu.c: reintroduce m->version logic

Add the "last_addr" optimization back. Like before, every ->show()
method checks !seq_overflow() and sets m->version = vma->vm_start.

However, it also checks that m_next_vma(vma) != NULL, otherwise it
sets m->version = -1 for the lockless "EOF" fast-path in m_start().

m_start() can simply do find_vma() + m_next_vma() if last_addr is
not zero, the code looks clear and simple and this case is clearly
separated from "scan vmas" path.
