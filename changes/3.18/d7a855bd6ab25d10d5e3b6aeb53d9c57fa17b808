tty: Convert tty_struct bitfield to ints

The stopped, hw_stopped, flow_stopped and packet bits are smp-unsafe
and interrupt-unsafe. For example,

CPU 0                         | CPU 1
                              |
tty->flow_stopped = 1         | tty->hw_stopped = 0

One of these updates will be corrupted, as the bitwise operation
on the bitfield is non-atomic.

Ensure each flag has a separate memory location, so concurrent
updates do not corrupt orthogonal states. Because DEC Alpha EV4 and EV5
cpus (from 1995) perform RMW on smaller-than-machine-word storage,
"separate memory location" must be int instead of byte.
