powerpc/eeh: Clear frozen state on passing device

When passing through device, its PE might have been put into frozen
state. One obvious example would be: the passed PE is forced to be
offline because of hitting maximal allowed EEH errors in userland.
In that case, the frozen state won't be cleared and then the PE is
returned back to host, which might not have chance detecting and
recovering from it.

The patch adds more check when passing through device and clear the
PE frozen state if necessary.
