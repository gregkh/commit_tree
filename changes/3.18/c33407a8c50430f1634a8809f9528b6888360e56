wil6210: manual FW error recovery mode

Introduce manual FW recovery mode. It is activated if module parameter
@no_fw_recovery set to true. May be changed at runtime.

Recovery information provided by new "recovery" debugfs file. It prints:

mode = [auto|manual]
state = [idle|pending|running]

In manual mode, after FW error, recovery won't start automatically. Instead,
after notification to user space, recovery waits in "pending" state, as indicated by the
"recovery" debugfs file. User space tools may perform data collection and allow to
continue recovery by writing "run" to the "recovery" debugfs file.
Alternatively, recovery pending may be canceled by stopping network interface
i.e. 'ifconfig wlan0 down'
