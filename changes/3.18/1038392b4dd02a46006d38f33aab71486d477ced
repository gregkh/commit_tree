drm/i915: Disable trickle feed for gen2/3

My 830 is unhappy with trickle feed enabled. The symptom is that
the image on the screen shifts a bit to right occasionally.

The BIOS initially disables trickle feed, but it gets reset during
suspend, so we need to re-disable it ourselves. Juse disable it
always.

Also disable it for all other gen2/3 platforms since we disable it
for all more recent platforms as well (until HSW that is). At least
my 855 doesn't seem to mind us doing this. I don't have gen3
hardware to test that.
