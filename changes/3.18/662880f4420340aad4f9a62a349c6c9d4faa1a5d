net: Allow GRO to use and set levels of checksum unnecessary

Allow GRO path to "consume" checksums provided in CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY
and to report new checksums verfied for use in fallback to normal
path.

Change GRO checksum path to track csum_level using a csum_cnt field
in NAPI_GRO_CB. On GRO initialization, if ip_summed is
CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY set NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->csum_cnt to
skb->csum_level + 1. For each checksum verified, decrement
NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->csum_cnt while its greater than zero. If a checksum
is verfied and NAPI_GRO_CB(skb)->csum_cnt == 0, we have verified a
deeper checksum than originally indicated in skbuf so increment
csum_level (or initialize to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY if ip_summed is
CHECKSUM_NONE or CHECKSUM_COMPLETE).
