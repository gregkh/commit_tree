usb: hub: allow to process more usb hub events in parallel

It seems that only choose_devnum() was not ready to process more hub
events at the same time.

All should be fine if we take bus->usb_address0_mutex there. It will
make sure that more devnums will not be chosen for the given bus and
the related devices at the same time.
