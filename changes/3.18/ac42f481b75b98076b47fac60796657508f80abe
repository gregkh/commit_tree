ARM: dts: rockchip: add rk3066 and rk3188 dma controllers

Add both the cpu and peripheral pl330 dma controllers present in rk3188 socs.
The first dma controller can change between secure and non-secure mode. Both
instances are added but the non-secure variant is left disabled by default,
as on the majority of boards the bootloader leaves it in secure mode.
