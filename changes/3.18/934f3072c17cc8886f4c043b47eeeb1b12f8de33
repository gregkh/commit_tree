mm: clear __GFP_FS when PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO is set

commit 21caf2fc1931 ("mm: teach mm by current context info to not do I/O
during memory allocation") introduces PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO flag to avoid doing
I/O inside memory allocation, __GFP_IO is cleared when this flag is set,
but __GFP_FS implies __GFP_IO, it should also be cleared.  Or it may still
run into I/O, like in superblock shrinker.  And this will make the kernel
run into the deadlock case described in that commit.

See Dave Chinner's comment about io in superblock shrinker:

Filesystem shrinkers do indeed perform IO from the superblock shrinker and
have for years.  Even clean inodes can require IO before they can be freed
- e.g.  on an orphan list, need truncation of post-eof blocks, need to
wait for ordered operations to complete before it can be freed, etc.

IOWs, Ext4, btrfs and XFS all can issue and/or block on arbitrary amounts
of IO in the superblock shrinker context.  XFS, in particular, has been
doing transactions and IO from the VFS inode cache shrinker since it was
first introduced....

Fix this by clearing __GFP_FS in memalloc_noio_flags(), this function has
masked all the gfp_mask that will be passed into fs for the processes
setting PF_MEMALLOC_NOIO in the direct reclaim path.
