net: Add function for parsing the header length out of linear ethernet frames

This patch updates some of the flow_dissector api so that it can be used to
parse the length of ethernet buffers stored in fragments.  Most of the
changes needed were to __skb_get_poff as it needed to be updated to support
sending a linear buffer instead of a skb.

I have split __skb_get_poff into two functions, the first is skb_get_poff
and it retains the functionality of the original __skb_get_poff.  The other
function is __skb_get_poff which now works much like __skb_flow_dissect in
relation to skb_flow_dissect in that it provides the same functionality but
works with just a data buffer and hlen instead of needing an skb.
