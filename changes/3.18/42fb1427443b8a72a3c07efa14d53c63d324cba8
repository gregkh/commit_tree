drm/ast: Don't assume DVO enabled means SIL164 on uninitialized chips

It looks like the AST2400 comes up with the DVO enable bit set,
which causes us to incorrectly assume we have a SIL164 regardless
of the value of the scratch registers setup by the BMC firmware.

So let's limit that test to the case where the chip has already
been setup by a BIOS.
