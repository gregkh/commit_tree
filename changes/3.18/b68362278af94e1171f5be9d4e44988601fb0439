drm/i915: More cautious with pch fifo underruns

Apparently PCH fifo underruns are tricky, we have plenty reports that
we see the occasional underrun (especially at boot-up).

So for a change let's see what happens when we don't re-enable pch
fifo underrun reporting when the pipe is disabled. This means that the
kernel can't catch pch fifo underruns when they happen (except when
all pipes are on on the pch). But we'll still catch underruns when
disabling the pipe again. So not a terrible reduction in test
coverage.

Since the DRM_ERROR is new and hence a regression plan B would be to
revert it back to a debug output. Which would be a lot worse than this
hack for underrun test coverage in the wild. See the referenced
discussions for more.
