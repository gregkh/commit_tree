mm/slab: move cache_flusharray() out of unlikely.text section

Now, due to likely keyword, compiled code of cache_flusharray() is on
unlikely.text section.  Although it is uncommon case compared to free to
cpu cache case, it is common case than free_block().  But, free_block() is
on normal text section.  This patch fix this odd situation to remove
likely keyword.
