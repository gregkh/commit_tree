ACPI / blacklist: add Win8 OSI quirks for some Dell laptop models

The wireless hotkey of those machines does not work with Win8 OSI.
Due to insufficient documentation for the driver implementation,
blacklist those machines as a workaround.

"audo wake on after shutdown" bug on Dell Inspiron 7737 is fixed by BIOS.
But this machine still suffers the hotkey issue. So keep the quirk for the
wireless hotkey issue.
