i40e/i40evf: Ignore a driver perceived Tx hang if the number of desc pending < 4

We are seeing situations where the driver sees a hang with less than 4
desc pending, if the driver chooses to ignore it the queue progresses
forward and the stack never experiences a real hang.
With this patch we will log a stat when this situation happens
"tx_sluggish" will increment and we can see some more details
at a higher debug level. Other than that we will ignore this
particular case of Tx hang.
