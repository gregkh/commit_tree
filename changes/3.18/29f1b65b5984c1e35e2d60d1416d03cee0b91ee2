KVM: EVENTFD: Remove inclusion of irq.h

Commit c77dcac (KVM: Move more code under CONFIG_HAVE_KVM_IRQFD) added
functionality that depends on definitions in ioapic.h when
__KVM_HAVE_IOAPIC is defined.

At the same time, kvm-arm commit 0ba0951 (KVM: EVENTFD: remove inclusion
of irq.h) removed the inclusion of irq.h, an architecture-specific header
that is not present on ARM but which happened to include ioapic.h on x86.

Include ioapic.h directly in eventfd.c if __KVM_HAVE_IOAPIC is defined.
This fixes x86 and lets ARM use eventfd.c.
