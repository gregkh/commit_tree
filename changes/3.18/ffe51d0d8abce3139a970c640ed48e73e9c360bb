HID: add support for PenMount HID TouchScreen Driver

This patch adds a seperate hid-penmount driver to work
around an issue with the HID report descriptor. The
descriptor does not contain the ContactID usage and as
result the touchscreen is represented as normal mouse
to the system.

This driver maps the button 0 emitted by the touchscreen
to BTN_TOUCH. This makes it possible to use touch events
in userspace.
