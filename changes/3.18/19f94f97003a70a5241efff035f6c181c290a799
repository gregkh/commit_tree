v4l2-pci-skeleton: Only build if PCI is available

Currently arm64 does not support PCI but it does support v4l2. Since the
PCI skeleton driver is built unconditionally as a module with no dependency
on PCI this causes build failures for arm64 allmodconfig. Fix this by
defining a symbol VIDEO_PCI_SKELETON for the skeleton and conditionalising
the build on that.
