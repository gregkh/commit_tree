locks: move freeing of leases outside of i_lock

There was only one place where we still could free a file_lock while
holding the i_lock -- lease_modify. Add a new list_head argument to the
lm_change operation, pass in a private list when calling it, and fix
those callers to dispose of the list once the lock has been dropped.
