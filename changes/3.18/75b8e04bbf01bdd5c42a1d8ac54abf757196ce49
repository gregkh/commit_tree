dm raid: add discard support for RAID levels 1 and 10

Discard support is not enabled for RAID levels 4, 5, and 6 at this time
due to concerns about unreliable discard_zeroes_data support on some
hardware.  Otherwise, discards could cause stripe data corruption
(classic example of bad apples spoiling the bunch).
