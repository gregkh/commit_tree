net: add alloc_skb_with_frags() helper

Extract from sock_alloc_send_pskb() code building skb with frags,
so that we can reuse this in other contexts.

Intent is to use it from tcp_send_rcvq(), tcp_collapse(), ...

We also want to replace some skb_linearize() calls to a more reliable
strategy in pathological cases where we need to reduce number of frags.
