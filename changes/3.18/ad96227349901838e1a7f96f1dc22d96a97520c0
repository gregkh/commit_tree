perf tools: Let a user specify a PMU event without any config terms

This enables a PMU event to be specified in the form:

	pmu//

which is effectively the same as:

	pmu/config=0/

This patch is a precursor to defining default config for a PMU.

Further explanation extracted from lkml thread:

Imagine that the 'tsc' term did not exist.

Intel PT trace data would not contain TSC packets, and the decoder would
not know how to decode them.

Then imagine that a new version of the hardware adds 'tsc'.

It is such a useful feature that we want it by default, but older
versions of the tools don't know how to decode it, so the kernel cannot
turn it on by default.

It is similar to why the kernel does not select perf_event_attr.mmap2 by
default.

The kernel doesn't know whether the tool supports it.
