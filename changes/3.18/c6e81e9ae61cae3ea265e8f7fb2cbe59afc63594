Bluetooth: Fix calling smp_distribute_keys() when still waiting for keys

When we're in the process of receiving keys in phase 3 of SMP we keep
track of which keys are still expected in the smp->remote_key_dist
variable. If we still have some key bits set we need to continue waiting
for more PDUs and not needlessly call smp_distribute_keys(). This patch
fixes two such cases in the smp_cmd_master_ident() and
smp_cmd_ident_addr_info() handler functions.
