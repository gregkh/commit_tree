net: bcmgenet: improve bcmgenet_mii_setup()

bcmgenet_mii_setup() is called from the PHY state machine every 1-2 seconds
when the PHYs are in PHY_POLL mode.

Improve bcmgenet_mii_setup() so that it touches the MAC registers only when
the link is up and there was a change to link, speed, duplex, or pause status.
