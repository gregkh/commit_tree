powerpc/fsl_msi: spread msi ints across different MSIRs

Allocate msis such that each time a new interrupt is requested,
the SRS (MSIR register select) to be used is allocated in a
round-robin fashion.
The end result is that the msi interrupts will be spread across
distinct MSIRs with the main benefit that now users can set
affinity to each msi int through the mpic irq backing up the
MSIR register.
This is achieved with the help of a newly introduced msi bitmap
api that allows specifying the starting point when searching
for a free msi interrupt.
