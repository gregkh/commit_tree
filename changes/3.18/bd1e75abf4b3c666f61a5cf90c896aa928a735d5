tcp: add coalescing attempt in tcp_ofo_queue()

In order to make TCP more resilient in presence of reorders, we need
to allow coalescing to happen when skbs from out of order queue are
transferred into receive queue. LRO/GRO can be completely canceled
in some pathological cases, like per packet load balancing on aggregated
links.

I had to move tcp_try_coalesce() up in the file above tcp_ofo_queue()
