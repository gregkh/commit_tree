ALSA: hda - Remove superfluous callbacks from STAC/IDT codecs

Now we can register multiple callbacks to each jack, most of hooks
used in STAC/IDT codecs can be removed by enabling the powermap update
callback for all relevant pins.  Along with this, the call of
stac_init_power_map() can be moved back to stac_parse_auto_config()
and the own build_controls callback can be removed, too.
