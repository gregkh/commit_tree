net: tcp: add flag for ca to indicate that ECN is required

This patch adds a flag to TCP congestion algorithms that allows
for requesting to mark IPv4/IPv6 sockets with transport as ECN
capable, that is, ECT(0), when required by a congestion algorithm.

It is currently used and needed in DataCenter TCP (DCTCP), as it
requires both peers to assert ECT on all IP packets sent - it
uses ECN feedback (i.e. CE, Congestion Encountered information)
from switches inside the data center to derive feedback to the
end hosts.

Therefore, simply add a new flag to icsk_ca_ops. Note that DCTCP's
algorithm/behaviour slightly diverges from RFC3168, therefore this
is only (!) enabled iff the assigned congestion control ops module
has requested this. By that, we can tightly couple this logic really
only to the provided congestion control ops.

Joint work with Florian Westphal and Glenn Judd.
