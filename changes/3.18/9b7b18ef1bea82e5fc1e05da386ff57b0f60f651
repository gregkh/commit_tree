Bluetooth: Fix SMP error and response to be mutually exclusive

Returning failure from the SMP data parsing function will cause an
immediate disconnect, making any attempts to send a response PDU futile.
This patch updates the function to always either send a response or
return an error, but never both at the same time:

* In the case that HCI_LE_ENABLED is not set we want to send a Pairing Not
  Supported response but it is not required to force a disconnection, so
  do not set the error return in this case.

* If we get garbage SMP data we can just fail with the handler function
  instead of also trying to send an SMP Failure PDU.

* There's no reason to force a disconnection if we receive an unknown SMP
  command. Instead simply send a proper Command Not Supported SMP
  response.
