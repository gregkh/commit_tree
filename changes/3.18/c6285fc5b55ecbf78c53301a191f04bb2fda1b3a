PCI: Apply _HPP settings to PCIe devices as well as PCI and PCI-X

The ACPI _HPP method was defined before PCIe existed, so its documentation
only mentions PCI.  The _HPX Type 0 setting record is essentially identical
to _HPP, but the spec (ACPI rev 5.0, sec 6.2.8.1) says it should be applied
to PCI, PCI-X, and PCIe devices, with settings being ignored if they are
not applicable.

Some platforms with both conventional PCI and PCIe devices provide only
_HPP (not _HPX), so treat _HPP the same way as an _HPX Type 0 record and
apply it to PCIe devices as well as PCI and PCI-X.
