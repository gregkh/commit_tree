pwm: lpss: Properly split driver to parts

The driver consists of core, PCI, and platform parts. It would be better
to split them into separate files.

The platform driver is now called pwm-lpss-platform. Thus, previously
set CONFIG_PWM_LPSS=m is not enough to build it. But we are on the safe
side since it seems no one from outside Intel is using it for now.

While here, move to use macros module_pci_driver() and
module_platform_driver().
