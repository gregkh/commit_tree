qlcnic: Add support to run firmware POST

This patch adds support to run Power On Self Test (POST) for 83xx adapters.
POST can be run in 3 different speed modes :
	i)  Fast mode (takes about 690 ms)
	ii) Medium mode (takes about 2930 ms)
	iii) Slow mode (takes about 7500 ms)

To run POST, firmware file with name "83xx_post_fw.bin" should be present under
/lib/firmware directory. load_fw_file module parameter is used to specify
POST operation and its speed mode.
load_fw_file = 2 : Fast mode
load_fw_file = 3 : Medium mode
load_fw_file = 4 : Slow mode
