drm/i915/bdw: Print context state in debugfs

This has turned out to be really handy in debug so far.

Update:
Since writing this patch, I've gotten similar code upstream for error
state. I've used it quite a bit in debugfs however, and I'd like to keep
it here at least until preemption is working.

This patch was accidentally dropped in the first Execlists version, and
it has been very useful indeed. Put it back again, but as a standalone
debugfs file.

v2: Take the device struct_mutex rather than mode_config mutex for
atomic state capture.
