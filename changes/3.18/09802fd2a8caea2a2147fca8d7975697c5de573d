lockd: rip out deferred lock handling from testlock codepath

As Kinglong points out, the nlm_block->b_fl field is no longer used at
all. Also, vfs_test_lock in the generic locking code will only return
FILE_LOCK_DEFERRED if FL_SLEEP is set, and it isn't here.

The only other place that returns that value is the DLM lock code, but
it only does that in dlm_posix_lock, never in dlm_posix_get.

Remove all of the deferred locking code from the testlock codepath
since it doesn't appear to ever be used anyway.

I do have a small concern that this might cause a behavior change in the
case where you have a block already sitting on the list when the
testlock request comes in, but that looks like it doesn't really work
properly anyway. I think it's best to just pass that down to
vfs_test_lock and let the filesystem report that instead of trying to
infer what's going on with the lock by looking at an existing block.
