virtio_blk: drop config_enable

Now that virtio core ensures config changes don't
arrive during probing, drop config_enable flag
in virtio blk.
On removal, flush is now sufficient to guarantee that
no change work is queued.

This help simplify the driver, and will allow
setting DRIVER_OK earlier without losing config
change notifications.
