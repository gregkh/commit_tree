net/rds: do proper house keeping if connection fails in rds_tcp_conn_connect

I see two problems if we consider the sock->ops->connect attempt to fail in
rds_tcp_conn_connect. The first issue is that for example we don't remove the
previously added rds_tcp_connection item to rds_tcp_tc_list at
rds_tcp_set_callbacks, which means that on a next reconnect attempt for the
same rds_connection, when rds_tcp_conn_connect is called we can again call
rds_tcp_set_callbacks, resulting in duplicated items on rds_tcp_tc_list,
leading to list corruption: to avoid this just make sure we call
properly rds_tcp_restore_callbacks before we exit. The second issue
is that we should also release the sock properly, by setting sock = NULL
only if we are returning without error.
