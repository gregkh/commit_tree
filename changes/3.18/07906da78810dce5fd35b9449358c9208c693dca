tracing: Do not risk busy looping in buffer splice

If the read loop in trace_buffers_splice_read() keeps failing due to
memory allocation failures without reading even a single page then this
function will keep busy looping.

Remove the risk for that by exiting the function if memory allocation
failures are seen.
