ima: simplify conditional statement to improve performance

Precede bit testing before string comparison makes code
faster. Also refactor statement as a single line pointer
assignment. Logic is following: we set 'xattr_ptr' to read
xattr value when we will do appraisal or in any case when
measurement template is other than 'ima'.
