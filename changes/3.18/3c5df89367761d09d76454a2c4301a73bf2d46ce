rbd: read image size for discard check safely

In rbd_img_request_fill() the image size is only checked to determine
whether we can truncate an object instead of zeroing it for discard
requests. Take rbd_dev->header_rwsem while reading the image size, and
move this read into the discard check, so that non-discard ops don't
need to take the semaphore in this function.
