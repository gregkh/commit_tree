be2net: fix some log messages

This patch fixes the following minor issues with log messages in be2net:
  1) Period is not required at the end of log message.
  2) Remove "Unknown grp5 event" logs to reduce noise. The driver can safely
     ignore async events from FW it's not interested in.
  3) Reword a log message for better readability to say that SRIOV
     "is disabled" rather than "not supported".
