staging: comedi: amplc_pci224: remove "legacy" attach mechanism

Since the driver no longer supports options in its "legacy" attach
mechanism to describe the jumper settings (or any options beyond
restricting a PCI search to a particular bus and/or slot), there is no
need to retain this mechanism in the driver.  Remove the comedi driver
"attach" handler `pci224_attach()`, and the now unused
`pci224_find_pci_dev()`.  Also, remove the "wildcard" entry from the
board table `pci224_boards[]` as it is no longer needed.
