zbud: avoid accessing last unused freelist

For now, there are NCHUNKS of 64 freelists in zbud_pool, the last
unbuddied[63] freelist linked with all zbud pages which have free chunks
of 63.  Calculating according to context of num_free_chunks(), our max
chunk number of unbuddied zbud page is 62, so none of zbud pages will be
added/removed in last freelist, but still we will try to find an unbuddied
zbud page in the last unused freelist, it is unneeded.

This patch redefines NCHUNKS to 63 as free chunk number in one zbud page,
hence we can decrease size of zpool and avoid accessing the last unused
freelist whenever failing to allocate zbud from freelist in zbud_alloc.
