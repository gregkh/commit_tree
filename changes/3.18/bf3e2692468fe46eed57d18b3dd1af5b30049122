fs/proc/kcore.c: don't add modules range to kcore if it's equal to vmcore range

On some ARCHs modules range is eauql to vmalloc range. E.g on i686

	"#define MODULES_VADDR   VMALLOC_START"
	"#define MODULES_END     VMALLOC_END"

This will cause 2 duplicate program segments in /proc/kcore, and no flag
to indicate they are different.  This is confusing.  And usually people
who need check the elf header or read the content of kcore will check
memory ranges.  Two program segments which are the same are unnecessary.

So check if the modules range is equal to vmalloc range.  If so, just skip
adding the modules range.
