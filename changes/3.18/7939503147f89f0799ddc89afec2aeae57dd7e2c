KVM: s390: return -EFAULT if lowcore is not mapped during irq delivery

Currently we just kill the userspace process and exit the thread
immediatly without making sure that we don't hold any locks etc.

Improve this by making KVM_RUN return -EFAULT if the lowcore is not
mapped during interrupt delivery. To achieve this we need to pass
the return code of guest memory access routines used in interrupt
delivery all the way back to the KVM_RUN ioctl.
