ath10k: fix a conflict bug in wmi service bitmap

Service mapping for main firmware branch was incorrectly used for 10.x firmware
and vice-versa.  This caused wmi_services in debugfs to print wrong values.

This fixes commit cff990ce7ddd6 ("ath10k: fix wmi service bitmap debug") where
for some reason there was either a conflict that wasn't resolved properly or
git had a bad day.
