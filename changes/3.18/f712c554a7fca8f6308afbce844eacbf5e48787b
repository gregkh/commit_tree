pinctrl: qcom: Make the target processor value configurable

Currently the value used to specify that interrupts from the gpio should
be routed to the application processor is hardcoded for all Qualcomm SoCs.
But the new APQ8084 SoC uses a different value. To resolve this, we make
this value configurable for each SoC. For all existing SoCs we continue
to use the current value, and only for APQ8084 we use the new value.
