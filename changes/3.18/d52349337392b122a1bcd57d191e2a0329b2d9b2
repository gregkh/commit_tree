ixgbe: Do not schedule an uninitialized workqueue entry

If a hardware Tx timestamp is requested, an uninitialized
workqueue entry may be scheduled, especially on an 82598 adapter.
Add a check for a PTP clock to avoid that. Also only apply the
unlikely to the first term of the conditional. That will make the
rest of the checks be in the cold path.
