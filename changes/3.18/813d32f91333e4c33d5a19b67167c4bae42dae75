ext4: check s_chksum_driver when looking for bg csum presence

Convert the ext4_has_group_desc_csum predicate to look for a checksum
driver instead of the metadata_csum flag and change the bg checksum
calculation function to look for GDT_CSUM before taking the crc16
path.

Without this patch, if we mount with ^uninit_bg,^metadata_csum and
later metadata_csum gets turned on by accident, the block group
checksum functions will incorrectly assume that checksumming is
enabled (metadata_csum) but that crc16 should be used
(!s_chksum_driver).  This is totally wrong, so fix the predicate
and the checksum formula selection.

(Granted, if the metadata_csum feature bit gets enabled on a live FS
then something underhanded is going on, but we could at least avoid
writing garbage into the on-disk fields.)
