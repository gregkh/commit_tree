tipc: clean up socket timer function

The last remaining BH upcall to the socket, apart for the message
reception function tipc_sk_rcv(), is the timer function.

We prefer to let this function continue executing in BH, since it only
does read-acces to semi-permanent data, but we make three changes to it:

1) We introduce a bh_lock_sock()/bh_unlock_sock() inside the scope
   of port_lock.  This is a preparation for replacing port_lock with
   bh_lock_sock() at the locations where it is still used.

2) We move the function from port.c to socket.c, as a further step
   of eliminating the port code level altogether.

3) We let it make use of the newly introduced tipc_msg_create()
   function. This enables us to get rid of three context specific
   functions (port_create_self_abort_msg() etc.) in port.c
