ARM/arm64: KVM: fix use of WnR bit in kvm_is_write_fault()

The ISS encoding for an exception from a Data Abort has a WnR
bit[6] that indicates whether the Data Abort was caused by a
read or a write instruction. While there are several fields
in the encoding that are only valid if the ISV bit[24] is set,
WnR is not one of them, so we can read it unconditionally.

Instead of fixing both implementations of kvm_is_write_fault()
in place, reimplement it just once using kvm_vcpu_dabt_iswrite(),
which already does the right thing with respect to the WnR bit.
Also fix up the callers to pass 'vcpu'
