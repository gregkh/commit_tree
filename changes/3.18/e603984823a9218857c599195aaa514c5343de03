staging: et131x: Remove et131x driver from drivers/staging

The current version of the et131x driver has been accepted into the
main tree at /drivers/net/ethernet, so it can now be removed from
staging.

The MAINTAINERS entry has not been touched here, as the patch to
add the driver to drivers/net modifies it correctly.
