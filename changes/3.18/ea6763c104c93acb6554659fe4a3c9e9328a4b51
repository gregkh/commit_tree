video/fbdev: Always built-in video= cmdline parsing

In drm/i915 we want to get at the video= cmdline modes even when we
don't have fbdev support enabled, so that users can always override
the kernel's initial mode selection.

But that gives us a direct depency upon the parsing code in the fbdev
subsystem. Since it's so little code just extract these 2 functions
and always build them in.

Whiel at it fix the checkpatch fail in this code.

v2: Also move fb_mode_option. Spotted by the kbuild.

v3: Review from Geert:
- Keep the old copyright notice from fb_mem.c, although I have no
idea what exactly applies.
- Only compile this when needed.

I prefer if we can merge this through drm-next since we'll use it
there in follow-up patches.
