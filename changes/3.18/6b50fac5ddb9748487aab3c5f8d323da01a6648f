rtc: max77686: remove dead code for SMPL and WTSR

The MAX77686 RTC chip has two features called SMPL (Sudden Momentary
Power Loss) and WTSR (Watchdog Timeout and Software Resets).  Support
for these features seems to be implemented in the driver but compilation
is disabled using a C pre-processor conditional.

This code has been disabled since the driver was original merged in
commit fca1dd031a28 ("rtc: max77686: add Maxim 77686 driver").

So, since this code has never been built, let's just remove it.
