kbuild: remove unnecessary variable initializaions

Clearing obj-y, obj-m, obj-n, obj- in each Makefile is
a useless habit.

They are non-exported variables; therefore they are always empty
whenever descending into each subdirectory.
(Moreorver, obj-y and obj-m are also set to empty at the beginning
of scripts/Makefile.build)
