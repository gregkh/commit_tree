ARM: dts: Switch i2c0 to 400kHz on rk3288-evb-rk808

We should be able to talk to the PMIC at 400kHz.  No need to talk at
the slow 100kHz.

As measured by ftrace (with a bunch of extra patches, since cpufreq
for rk808 hasn't landed yet):
  before this change: cpu0_set_target() => ~500us
  after this change:  cpu0_set_target() => ~300us
