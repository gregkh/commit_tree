ipvs: Keep skb->sk when allocating headroom on tunnel xmit

ip_vs_prepare_tunneled_skb() ignores ->sk when allocating a new
skb, either unconditionally setting ->sk to NULL or allowing
the uninitialized ->sk from a newly allocated skb to leak through
to the caller.

This patch properly copies ->sk and increments its reference count.
