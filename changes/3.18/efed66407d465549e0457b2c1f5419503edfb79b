iwlwifi: mvm: rs: fix logic in case of multiple TIDs

In case of traffic on multiple TIDs where one is aggregated
and the other is not RS would toggle between considering
traffic vs. the station as aggregated and not aggregated.
Instead consider the sta state as aggregated as long as
there's at least one TID aggregated.
This limitation is because the rates table is kept per
station and not per TID.
