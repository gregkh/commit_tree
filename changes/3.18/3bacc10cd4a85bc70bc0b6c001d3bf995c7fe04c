[media] v4l2-common: fix overflow in v4l_bound_align_image()

Fix clamp_align() used in v4l_bound_align_image() to prevent overflow
when passed large value like UINT32_MAX.

 In the current implementation:
    clamp_align(UINT32_MAX, 8, 8192, 3)

returns 8, because in line:

    x = (x + (1 << (align - 1))) & mask;

x overflows to (-1 + 4) & 0x7 = 3, while expected value is 8192.

v4l_bound_align_image() is heavily used in VIDIOC_S_FMT and
VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT ioctls handlers, and documentation of the latter
explicitly states that:

"The modified format should be as close as possible to the original
request."
  -- http://linuxtv.org/downloads/v4l-dvb-apis/vidioc-subdev-g-fmt.html

Thus one would expect, that passing UINT32_MAX as format width and
height will result in setting maximum possible resolution for the
device. Particularly, when the driver doesn't support
VIDIOC_ENUM_FRAMESIZES ioctl, which is common in the codebase.
