staging: comedi: amplc_pci230: refactor iobase addresses

This driver uses two iobase addresses, found in PCI bars 2 and 3.
Currently, the address in PCI bar 2 is saved in the private data as
'iobase1' and the address in PCI bar 3 is saved in the comedi_device
as the 'iobase'. The 'iobase' is the base address of the daq
registers (ai/ao) of the board. The 'iobase1' address is the base
address of the 8255, 8254, configuration, and interrupt registers.

Flip the saving of these base addresses. Save the address from PCI
bar 2 in the comedi_device 'iobase' and the address from PCI bar 3
in the private data as 'daqio'.

This will help with some cleanup of the 8255 module.
