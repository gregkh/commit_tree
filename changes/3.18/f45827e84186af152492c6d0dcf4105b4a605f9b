overlayfs: implement show_options

This is useful because of the stacking nature of overlayfs.  Users like to
find out (via /proc/mounts) which lower/upper directory were used at mount
time.

AV: even failing ovl_parse_opt() could've done some kstrdup()
AV: failure of ovl_alloc_entry() should end up with ENOMEM, not EINVAL
