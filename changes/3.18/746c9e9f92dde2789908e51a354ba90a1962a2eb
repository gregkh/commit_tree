of/base: Fix PowerPC address parsing hack

We have a historical hack that treats missing ranges properties as the
equivalent of an empty one. This is needed for ancient PowerMac "bad"
device-trees, and shouldn't be enabled for any other PowerPC platform,
otherwise we get some nasty layout of devices in sysfs or even
duplication when a set of otherwise identically named devices is
created multiple times under a different parent node with no ranges
property.

This fix is needed for the PowerNV i2c busses to be exposed properly
and will fix a number of other embedded cases.
