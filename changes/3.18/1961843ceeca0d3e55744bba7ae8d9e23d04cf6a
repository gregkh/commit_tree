NFC: trf7970a: Handle timeout values of zero

The digital layer can try to send a command with a
timeout value of zero (e.g., digital_tg_send_psl_res().
The zero value is used as a flag to indicate that
the driver should not expect a response.  To handle
this, the driver sets an internal timer because it
should still get an interrupt with the TX bit set
in the IRQ Status Register.  When it gets that
interrupt, it returns a return value of '0'.
If it doesn't get the interrupt before timing out,
it returns ETIMEDOUT as usual.
