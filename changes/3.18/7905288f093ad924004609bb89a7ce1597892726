net: dsa: allow switches driver to implement get/set EEE

Allow switches driver to query and enable/disable EEE on a per-port
basis by implementing the ethtool_{get,set}_eee settings and delegating
these operations to the switch driver.

set_eee() will need to coordinate with the PHY driver to make sure that
EEE is enabled, the link-partner supports it and the auto-negotiation
result is satisfactory.
