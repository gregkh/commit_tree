perf: Do not POLLHUP event if it has children

Currently we return POLLHUP in event polling if the monitored
process is done, but we didn't consider possible children,
that might be still running and producing data.

Before returning POLLHUP making sure that:

   1) the monitored task has exited and that
   2) we don't have any children to monitor

Also adding parent wakeup when the child event is gone.
