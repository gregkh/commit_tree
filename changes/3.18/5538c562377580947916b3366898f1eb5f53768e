zsmalloc: simplify init_zspage free obj linking

Change zsmalloc init_zspage() logic to iterate through each object on each
of its pages, checking the offset to verify the object is on the current
page before linking it into the zspage.

The current zsmalloc init_zspage free object linking code has logic that
relies on there only being one page per zspage when PAGE_SIZE is a
multiple of class->size.  It calculates the number of objects for the
current page, and iterates through all of them plus one, to account for
the assumed partial object at the end of the page.  While this currently
works, the logic can be simplified to just link the object at each
successive offset until the offset is larger than PAGE_SIZE, which does
not rely on PAGE_SIZE being a multiple of class->size.
