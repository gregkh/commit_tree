md: Always set RECOVERY_NEEDED when clearing RECOVERY_FROZEN

md_check_recovery will skip any recovery and also clear
MD_RECOVERY_NEEDED if MD_RECOVERY_FROZEN is set.
So when we clear _FROZEN, we must set _NEEDED and ensure that
md_check_recovery gets run.
Otherwise we could miss out on something that is needed.

In particular, this can make it impossible to remove a
failed device from an array is the  'recovery-needed' processing
didn't happen.
Suitable for stable kernels since 3.13.
