locking/rwlock, x86: Clean up asm/spinlock*.h to remove old rwlock code

As the x86 architecture now uses qrwlock for its read/write lock
implementation, it is no longer necessary to keep the old rwlock code
around. This patch removes the old rwlock code in the asm/spinlock.h
and asm/spinlock_types.h files. Now the ARCH_USE_QUEUE_RWLOCK
config parameter cannot be removed from x86/Kconfig or there will be
a compilation error.
