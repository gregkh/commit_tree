ASoC: Fix snd_soc_find_dai() matching component by name

Commit 14621c7e5e72 ("ASoC: Consolidate CPU and CODEC DAI lookup")
consolidated the lookup of CPU DAIs and CODEC DAIs into a single function.
When matching a component by name for CODEC DAIs the code previous to the
patch compared the name in the DAI link table with component->name. For CPU
DAIs the code compared to dev_name(component->dev). The newly introduced
function ended up using the later as well.

For most components dev_name(component->dev) and component->name are the
same. The main notable exception are I2C devices where the driver name and
the device name are concatenated to form the component name. By using
dev_name(component->dev) instead of component->name the patch broke the
matching of I2C CODECs by name.

This patch restores the original behavior by using component->name instead
of dev_name(component->dev). This will be safe even for CPU DAIs since for
CPU DAIs both are the same.
