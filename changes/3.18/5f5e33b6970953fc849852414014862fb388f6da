i40e: set num_queue_pairs to num configured by VF

Change vsi->num_queue_pairs to equal the number that are configured
by the VF. This, in turn, limits the number of queues that are
enable/disabled. This fixes the mismatched case for when a VF configures
fewer queues than is allocated to it by the PF.

Change other sections to use alloc_queue_pairs as warranted.
