drm/i915: Gather the HDMI level shifter logic into one place

The knowledge about the HDMI/DVI DDI translation table was scattered
around.
  - info->hdmi_level_shift was initialized with 6, the index of the 800
    mV, 0dB translation
  - A check on the VBT value was done to ensure it wasn't overflowing
    the translation table (< 0xC)
  - The actual programming was done in intel_ddi.c

As we need to change that knowledge for Broadwell, let's gather
everything into one place.
