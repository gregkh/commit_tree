audit: x86: drop arch from __audit_syscall_entry() interface

Since the arch is found locally in __audit_syscall_entry(), there is no need to
pass it in as a parameter.  Delete it from the parameter list.

x86* was the only arch to call __audit_syscall_entry() directly and did so from
assembly code.

As this patch relies on changes in the audit tree, I think it
appropriate to send it through my tree rather than the x86 tree.
