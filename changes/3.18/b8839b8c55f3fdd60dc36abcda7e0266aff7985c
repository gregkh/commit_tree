block: fix alignment_offset math that assumes io_min is a power-of-2

The math in both blk_stack_limits() and queue_limit_alignment_offset()
assume that a block device's io_min (aka minimum_io_size) is always a
power-of-2.  Fix the math such that it works for non-power-of-2 io_min.

This issue (of alignment_offset != 0) became apparent when testing
dm-thinp with a thinp blocksize that matches a RAID6 stripesize of
1280K.  Commit fdfb4c8c1 ("dm thin: set minimum_io_size to pool's data
block size") unlocked the potential for alignment_offset != 0 due to
the dm-thin-pool's io_min possibly being a non-power-of-2.
