acer-wmi: Add acpi_backlight=video quirk for the Acer KAV80

The acpi-video backlight interface on the Acer KAV80 is broken, and worse
it causes the entire machine to slow down significantly after a suspend/resume.

Blacklist it, and use the acer-wmi backlight interface instead. Note that
the KAV80 is somewhat unique in that it is the only Acer model where we
fall back to acer-wmi after blacklisting, rather then using the native
(e.g. intel) backlight driver. This is done because there is no native
backlight interface on this model.
