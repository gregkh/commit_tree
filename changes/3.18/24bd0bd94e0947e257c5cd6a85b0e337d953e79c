Bluetooth: Centralize disallowing SMP commands to a single place

All the cases where we mark SMP commands as dissalowed are their
respective command handlers. We can therefore simplify the code by
always clearing the bit immediately after testing it. This patch
converts the corresponding test_bit() call to a test_and_clear_bit()
call and also removes the now unused SMP_DISALLOW_CMD macro.
