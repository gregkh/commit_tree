x86: kvm: use alternatives for VMCALL vs. VMMCALL if kernel text is read-only

On x86_64, kernel text mappings are mapped read-only with CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA.
In that case, KVM will fail to patch VMCALL instructions to VMMCALL
as required on AMD processors.

The failure mode is currently a divide-by-zero exception, which obviously
is a KVM bug that has to be fixed.  However, picking the right instruction
between VMCALL and VMMCALL will be faster and will help if you cannot upgrade
the hypervisor.
