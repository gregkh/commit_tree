mac80211: fix broken use of VHT/20Mhz with some APs

commit "mac80211: disable 40MHz support in case of 20MHz AP"
broke working VHT in 20Mhz with APs like Netgear R6300v2 which
do not publish support for 40Mhz but allow use of VHT in 20Mhz.
The break is because VHT is disabled once no HT cap doesn't indicate
support for 40Mhz. This causes the assoc request to be sent without
any VHT IE and the association is only HT due to this.
