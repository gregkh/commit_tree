block,scsi: fixup blk_get_request dead queue scenarios

The blk_get_request function may fail in low-memory conditions or during
device removal (even if __GFP_WAIT is set). To distinguish between these
errors, modify the blk_get_request call stack to return the appropriate
ERR_PTR. Verify that all callers check the return status and consider
IS_ERR instead of a simple NULL pointer check.

For consistency, make a similar change to the blk_mq_alloc_request leg
of blk_get_request.  It may fail if the queue is dead, or the caller was
unwilling to wait.
