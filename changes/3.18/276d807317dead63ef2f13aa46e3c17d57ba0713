Bluetooth: Remove unused l2cap_conn->security_timer

Now that there are no-longer any users for l2cap_conn->security_timer we
can go ahead and simply remove it. The patch makes initialization of the
conn->info_timer unconditional since it's better not to leave any
l2cap_conn data structures uninitialized no matter what the underlying
transport.
