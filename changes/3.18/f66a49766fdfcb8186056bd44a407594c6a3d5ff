staging: xillybus: Removed mmiowb() before mutex_unlock()

The relevant sequences consist of two I/O memory writes. The second write
depends on the first one. mmiowb() was inserted to make sure that no other
thread inserts a "first write" before the current one finished its second.

As a mutex protects this critical sequence, mmiowb() is unnecessary.
