hwmon: (g762) fix call to devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups()

g762_remove() needs to first call hwmon_device_unregister() and then
g762_of_clock_disable(). For that reason, it is not possible to
convert it to devm_hwmon_device_register_with_groups() and the
the non device managed version must be used.

This is correctly stated in commit message for 398e16db6262 ("hwmon:
(g762) Convert to hwmon_device_register_with_groups") but the
associated changes do in fact introduce a call to the device managed
version of the function.

This patch fixes that typo by switching to the non devm_ version.
