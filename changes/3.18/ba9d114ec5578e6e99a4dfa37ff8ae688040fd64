libceph: clear r_req_lru_item in __unregister_linger_request()

kick_requests() can put linger requests on the notarget list.  This
means we need to clear the much-overloaded req->r_req_lru_item in
__unregister_linger_request() as well, or we get an assertion failure
in ceph_osdc_release_request() - !list_empty(&req->r_req_lru_item).

AFAICT the assumption was that registered linger requests cannot be on
any of req->r_req_lru_item lists, but that's clearly not the case.
