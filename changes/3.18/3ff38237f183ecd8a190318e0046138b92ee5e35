drivers/rtc/rtc-pcf8563.c: fix pcf8563_irq() error return value

As pointed out by Sergei Shtylyov, the pcf8563_irq function contains a
bug in the error handling: an interrupt handler is not supposed to
return an errno value but an 'enum irqreturn'.

Let's fix this by returning IRQ_NONE in case of a communication error.
