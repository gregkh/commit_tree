ocfs2: don't fire quorum before connection established

Firing quorum before connection established can cause unexpected node to
reboot.

Assume there are 3 nodes in the cluster, Node 1, 2, 3.  Node 2 and 3 have
wrong ip address of Node 1 in cluster.conf and global heartbeat is enabled
in the cluster.  After the heatbeats are started on these three nodes,
Node 1 will reboot due to quorum fencing.  It is similar case if Node 1's
networking is not ready when starting the global heartbeat.

The reboot is not friendly as customer is not fully ready for ocfs2 to
work.  Fix it by not allowing firing quorum before the connection is
established.  In this case, ocfs2 will wait until the wrong configuration
is fixed or networking is up to continue.  Also update the log to guide
the user where to check when connection is not built for a long time.
