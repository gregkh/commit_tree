clocksource: arm_arch_timer: Discard unavailable timers correctly

Currently we wait until both cp15 and mem timers are probed if we
have both timer device nodes present in the device tree without
checking if the device is actually available. If one of the timer
device node present is disabled, the system locks up on the boot
as no timer gets registered.

This patch adds the check for the availability of the timer device
so that unavailable timers are discarded correctly. It also adds
the missing of_node_put.
