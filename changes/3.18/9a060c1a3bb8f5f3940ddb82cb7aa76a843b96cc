ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabresd: Configure the pins locally

Passing '0x80000000' to the pin configuration means that kernel will skip the
IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL configuration and will use whathever values come from the
bootloader.

Instead of relying on the bootloader setup, let's configure it in the kernel to
have predictable settings.

'0x1b0b0' is the default POR value for all these pins and has also been verified
that the pins are using this value by manually inspecting the IOMUXC_SW_PAD_CTL
registers, so no functional change has been made.
