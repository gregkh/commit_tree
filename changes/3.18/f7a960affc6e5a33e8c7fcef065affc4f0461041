KVM: s390/cmm: Fix prefix handling for diag 10 balloon

The old handling of prefix pages was broken in the diag10 ballooner.
We now rely on gmap_discard to check for start > end and do a
slow path if the prefix swap pages are affected:
1. discard the pages from start to prefix
2. discard the absolute 0 pages
3. discard the pages after prefix swap to end
