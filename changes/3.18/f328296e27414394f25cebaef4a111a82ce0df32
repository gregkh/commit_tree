locks: Copy fl_lmops information for conflock in locks_copy_conflock()

Commit d5b9026a67 ([PATCH] knfsd: locks: flag NFSv4-owned locks) using
fl_lmops field in file_lock for checking nfsd4 lockowner.

But, commit 1a747ee0cc (locks: don't call ->copy_lock methods on return
of conflicting locks) causes the fl_lmops of conflock always be NULL.

Also, commit 0996905f93 (lockd: posix_test_lock() should not call
locks_copy_lock()) caused the fl_lmops of conflock always be NULL too.

Make sure copy the private information by fl_copy_lock() in struct
file_lock_operations, merge __locks_copy_lock() to fl_copy_lock().

Jeff advice, "Set fl_lmops on conflocks, but don't set fl_ops.
fl_ops are superfluous, since they are callbacks into the filesystem.
There should be no need to bother the filesystem at all with info
in a conflock. But, lock _ownership_ matters for conflocks and that's
indicated by the fl_lmops. So you really do want to copy the fl_lmops
for conflocks I think."

v5: add missing calling of locks_release_private() in nlmsvc_testlock()
v4: only copy fl_lmops for conflock, don't copy fl_ops
