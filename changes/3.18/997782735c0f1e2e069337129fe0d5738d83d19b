dm: remove nr_iovecs parameter from alloc_tio()

alloc_tio() uses bio_alloc_bioset() to allocate a clone-bio for a bio.
alloc_tio() takes the number of bvecs to allocate for the clone-bio.
However, with v3.14's immutable biovec changes DM now uses
__bio_clone_fast() and no longer needs to allocate bvecs.

In practice, the 'nr_iovecs' passed to alloc_tio() is always effectively
0.  __clone_and_map_simple_bio() looked like it was passing non-zero
nr_iovecs, but its value was always within the range of inline bvecs and
no allocation actually happened.  If allocation happened, the BUG_ON() in
__bio_clone_fast() would've triggered.

Remove the nr_iovecs parameter from alloc_tio() to prevent possible
future bio_alloc_bioset() mis-use of a new bioset interface that will no
longer allow bvecs to be allocated.

Also fix extra whitespace before the __bio_clone_fast() call in
__clone_and_map_simple_bio().
