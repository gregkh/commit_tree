netlink: Properly unbind in error conditions.

Even if netlink_kernel_cfg::unbind is implemented the unbind() method is
not called, because cfg->unbind is omitted in __netlink_kernel_create().
And fix wrong argument of test_bit() and off by one problem.

At this point, no unbind() method is implemented, so there is no real
issue.
