iommu/arm-smmu: add support for multi-master iommu groups

Whilst the driver currently creates one IOMMU group per device, this
will soon change when we start supporting non-transparent PCI bridges
which require all upstream masters to be assigned to the same address
space.

This patch reworks our IOMMU group code so that we can easily support
multi-master groups. The master configuration (streamids and smrs) is
stored as private iommudata on the group, whilst the low-level attach/detach
code is updated to avoid double alloc/free when dealing with multiple
masters sharing the same SMMU configuration. This unifies device
handling, regardless of whether the device sits on the platform or pci
bus.
