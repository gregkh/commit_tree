kvm: Remove ept_identity_pagetable from struct kvm_arch.

kvm_arch->ept_identity_pagetable holds the ept identity pagetable page. But
it is never used to refer to the page at all.

In vcpu initialization, it indicates two things:
1. indicates if ept page is allocated
2. indicates if a memory slot for identity page is initialized

Actually, kvm_arch->ept_identity_pagetable_done is enough to tell if the ept
identity pagetable is initialized. So we can remove ept_identity_pagetable.

NOTE: In the original code, ept identity pagetable page is pinned in memroy.
      As a result, it cannot be migrated/hot-removed. After this patch, since
      kvm_arch->ept_identity_pagetable is removed, ept identity pagetable page
      is no longer pinned in memory. And it can be migrated/hot-removed.
