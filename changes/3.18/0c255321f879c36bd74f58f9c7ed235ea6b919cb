fs/proc/task_mmu.c: simplify m_start() to make it readable

Now that m->version is gone we can cleanup m_start(). In particular,

  - Remove the "unsigned long" typecast, m->index can't be negative
    or exceed ->map_count. But lets use "unsigned int pos" to make
    it clear that "pos < map_count" is safe.

  - Remove the unnecessary "vma != NULL" check in the main loop. It
    can't be NULL unless we have a vm bug.

  - This also means that "pos < map_count" case can simply return the
    valid vma and avoid "goto" and subsequent checks.
