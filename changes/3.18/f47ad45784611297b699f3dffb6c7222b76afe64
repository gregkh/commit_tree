percpu_ref: decouple switching to percpu mode and reinit

percpu_ref has treated the dropping of the base reference and
switching to atomic mode as an integral operation; however, there's
nothing inherent tying the two together.

The use cases for percpu_ref have been expanding continuously.  While
the current init/kill/reinit/exit model can cover a lot, the coupling
of kill/reinit with atomic/percpu mode switching is turning out to be
too restrictive for use cases where many percpu_refs are created and
destroyed back-to-back with only some of them reaching extended
operation.  The coupling also makes implementing always-atomic debug
mode difficult.

This patch separates out percpu mode switching into
percpu_ref_switch_to_percpu() and reimplements percpu_ref_reinit() on
top of it.

* DEAD still requires ATOMIC.  A dead ref can't be switched to percpu
  mode w/o going through reinit.

v2: __percpu_ref_switch_to_percpu() was missing static.  Fixed.
