KVM: x86: count actual tlb flushes

- we count KVM_REQ_TLB_FLUSH requests, not actual flushes
  (KVM can have multiple requests for one flush)
- flushes from kvm_flush_remote_tlbs aren't counted
- it's easy to make a direct request by mistake

Solve these by postponing the counting to kvm_check_request().
