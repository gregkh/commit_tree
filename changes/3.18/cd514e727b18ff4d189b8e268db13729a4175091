lib/string.c: remove duplicated function

lib/string.c contains two functions, strnicmp and strncasecmp, which do
roughly the same thing, namely compare two strings case-insensitively up
to a given bound.  They have slightly different implementations, but the
only important difference is that strncasecmp doesn't handle len==0
appropriately; it effectively becomes strcasecmp in that case.  strnicmp
correctly says that two strings are always equal in their first 0
characters.

strncasecmp is the POSIX name for this functionality.  So rename the
non-broken function to the standard name.  To minimize the impact on the
rest of the kernel (and since both are exported to modules), make strnicmp
a wrapper for strncasecmp.
