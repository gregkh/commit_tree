x86, fpu: copy_process: Sanitize fpu->last_cpu initialization

Cosmetic, but imho memset(&dst->thread.fpu, 0) is not good simply
because it hides the (important) usage of ->has_fpu/etc from grep.
Change this code to initialize the members explicitly.

And note that ->last_cpu = 0 looks simply wrong, this can confuse
fpu_lazy_restore() if per_cpu(fpu_owner_task, 0) has already exited
and copy_process() re-allocated the same task_struct. Fortunately
this is not actually possible because child->fpu_counter == 0 and
thus fpu_lazy_restore() will not be called, but still this is not
clean/robust.
