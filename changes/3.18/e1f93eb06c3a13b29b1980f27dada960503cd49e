net: sched: cls_fw: add missing tcf_exts_init call in fw_change()

When allocating a new structure we also need to call tcf_exts_init
to initialize exts.

A follow up patch might be in order to remove some of this code
and do tcf_exts_assign(). With this we could remove the
tcf_exts_init/tcf_exts_change pattern for some of the classifiers.
As part of the future tcf_actions RCU series this will need to be
done. For now fix the call here.
