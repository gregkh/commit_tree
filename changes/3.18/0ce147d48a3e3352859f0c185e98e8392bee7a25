ufs: introduce well known logical unit in ufs

UFS device may have standard LUs and LUN id could be from 0x00 to 0x7F.
UFS device specification use "Peripheral Device Addressing Format"
(SCSI SAM-5) for standard LUs.

UFS device may also have the Well Known LUs (also referred as W-LU) which
again could be from 0x00 to 0x7F. For W-LUs, UFS device specification only
allows the "Extended Addressing Format" (SCSI SAM-5) which means the W-LUNs
would start from 0xC100 onwards.

This means max. LUN number reported from UFS device could be 0xC17F hence
this patch advertise the "max_lun" as 0xC17F which will allow SCSI mid
layer to detect the W-LUs as well.

But once the W-LUs are detected, UFSHCD driver may get the commands with
SCSI LUN id upto 0xC17F but UPIU LUN id field is only 8-bit wide so it
requires the mapping of SCSI LUN id to UPIU LUN id. This patch also add
support for this mapping.
