KVM: Unconditionally export KVM_CAP_READONLY_MEM

The idea between capabilities and the KVM_CHECK_EXTENSION ioctl is that
userspace can, at run-time, determine if a feature is supported or not.
This allows KVM to being supporting a new feature with a new kernel
version without any need to update user space.  Unfortunately, since the
definition of KVM_CAP_READONLY_MEM was guarded by #ifdef
__KVM_HAVE_READONLY_MEM, such discovery still required a user space
update.

Therefore, unconditionally export KVM_CAP_READONLY_MEM and change the
in-kernel conditional to rely on __KVM_HAVE_READONLY_MEM.
