ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva: Sync DTS

Take the contents from the Armadillo800EVA DT reference DTS
and add them to the "regular" Armadillo800EVA DTS. This is
preparation for removal of the DT reference DTS. So the goal
is to have a single DTS for this Armadillo board.

The SoC "r8a7740" is added to compatible string but the board
is left as-is (excluding the reference suffix).

The kernel command line is left as-is, earlyprintk is used in
case of legacy and for multiplatform we can simply ignore it
for now.
