ovl: fix race in private xattr checks

Xattr operations can race with copy up.  This does not matter as long as
we consistently fiter out "trunsted.overlay.opaque" attribute on upper
directories.

Previously we checked parent against OVL_PATH_MERGE.  This is too general,
and prone to race with copy-up.  I.e. we found the parent to be on the
lower layer but ovl_dentry_real() would return the copied-up dentry,
possibly with the "opaque" attribute.

So instead use ovl_path_real() and decide to filter the attributes based on
the actual type of the dentry we'll use.
