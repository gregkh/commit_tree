usb: dwc3: add tracepoints to aid debugging

When we're debugging hard-to-reproduce and time-sensitive
use cases, printk() poses too much overhead. That's when
the kernel's tracing infrastructure comes into play.

This patch implements a few initial tracepoints for the
dwc3 driver. More traces can be added as necessary in order
to ease the task of debugging dwc3.
