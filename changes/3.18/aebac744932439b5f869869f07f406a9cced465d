fec: Remove fec_enet_select_queue()

Sparse complains about fec_enet_select_queue() not being static.

Feedback from David Miller [1] was to remove this function instead of making it
static:

"Please just delete this function.

It's overriding code which does exactly the same thing.

Actually, more precisely, this code is duplicating code in a way that
bypasses many core facilitites of the networking.  For example, this
override means that socket based flow steering, XPS, etc. are all
not happening on these devices.

Without ->ndo_select_queue(), the flow dissector does __netdev_pick_tx
which is exactly what you want to happen."
