mem-hotplug: reset node managed pages when hot-adding a new pgdat

In free_area_init_core(), zone->managed_pages is set to an approximate
value for lowmem, and will be adjusted when the bootmem allocator frees
pages into the buddy system.

But free_area_init_core() is also called by hotadd_new_pgdat() when
hot-adding memory.  As a result, zone->managed_pages of the newly added
node's pgdat is set to an approximate value in the very beginning.

Even if the memory on that node has node been onlined,
/sys/device/system/node/nodeXXX/meminfo has wrong value:

  hot-add node2 (memory not onlined)
  cat /sys/device/system/node/node2/meminfo
  Node 2 MemTotal:       33554432 kB
  Node 2 MemFree:               0 kB
  Node 2 MemUsed:        33554432 kB
  Node 2 Active:                0 kB

This patch fixes this problem by reset node managed pages to 0 after
hot-adding a new node.

1. Move reset_managed_pages_done from reset_node_managed_pages() to
   reset_all_zones_managed_pages()
2. Make reset_node_managed_pages() non-static
3. Call reset_node_managed_pages() in hotadd_new_pgdat() after pgdat
   is initialized
