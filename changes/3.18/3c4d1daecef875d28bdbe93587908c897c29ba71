vxlan: Fix bug introduced by commit acbf74a76300

Commit acbf74a76300 ("vxlan: Refactor vxlan driver to make use of the common UDP tunnel functions." introduced a bug in vxlan_xmit_one()
function, causing it to transmit Vxlan packets without proper
Vxlan header inserted. The change was not needed in the first
place. Revert it.
