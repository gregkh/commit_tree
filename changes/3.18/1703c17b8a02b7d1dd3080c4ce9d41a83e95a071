Staging: rtl8188eu: os_dep: Compression of lines for immediate return

This patch compresses two lines in to a single line in file rtw_android.c
if immediate return statement is found. It also removes variable bytes_written as
it is no longer needed.

It is done using script Coccinelle. And coccinelle uses following semantic
patch for this compression function:

@@
expression ret;
identifier f;
@@

-ret =
+return
     f(...);
-return ret;
