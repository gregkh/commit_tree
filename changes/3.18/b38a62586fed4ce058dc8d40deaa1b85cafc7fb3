Btrfs: add work_struct information for workqueue tracepoint

Kernel workqueue's tracepoints print the address of work_struct, while btrfs
workqueue's tracepoints print the address of btrfs_work.

We need a connection between this two, for example when debuging, we usually
grep an address in the trace output.  So it'd be better to also print
work_struct in btrfs workqueue's tracepoint.

Please note that we can only add this into those tracepoints whose work is still
available in memory because we need to reference the work.
