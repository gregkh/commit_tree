amd-xgbe: Fix napi Rx budget accounting

Currently the amd-xgbe driver increments the packets processed counter
each time a descriptor is processed.  Since a packet can be represented
by more than one descriptor incrementing the counter in this way is not
appropriate.  Also, since multiple descriptors cause the budget check
to be short circuited, sometimes the returned value from the poll
function would be larger than the budget value resulting in a WARN_ONCE
being triggered.

Update the polling logic to properly account for the number of packets
processed and exit when the budget value is reached.
