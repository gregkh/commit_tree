arm/arm64: KVM: Fix set_clear_sgi_pend_reg offset

The sgi values calculated in read_set_clear_sgi_pend_reg() and
write_set_clear_sgi_pend_reg() were horribly incorrectly multiplied by 4
with catastrophic results in that subfunctions ended up overwriting
memory not allocated for the expected purpose.

This showed up as bugs in kfree() and the kernel complaining a lot of
you turn on memory debugging.
