PM / Domains: Add APIs to attach/detach a PM domain for a device

To maintain scalability let's add common methods to attach and detach
a PM domain for a device, dev_pm_domain_attach|detach().

Typically dev_pm_domain_attach() shall be invoked from subsystem level
code at the probe phase to try to attach a device to its PM domain.
The reversed actions may be done a the remove phase and then by
invoking dev_pm_domain_detach().

When attachment succeeds, the attach function should assign its
corresponding detach function to a new ->detach() callback added in the
struct dev_pm_domain.
