xfs: xfs_buf_ioend and xfs_buf_iodone_work duplicate functionality

We do some work in xfs_buf_ioend, and some work in
xfs_buf_iodone_work, but much of that functionality is the same.
This work can all be done in a single function, leaving
xfs_buf_iodone just a wrapper to determine if we should execute it
by workqueue or directly. hence rename xfs_buf_iodone_work to
xfs_buf_ioend(), and add a new xfs_buf_ioend_async() for places that
need async processing.
