tipc: eliminate port_connect()/port_disconnect() functions

tipc_port_connect()/tipc_port_disconnect() are remnants of the obsolete
native API. Their only task is to grab port_lock and call the functions
__tipc_port_connect()/__tipc_port_disconnect() respectively, which will
perform the actual state change.

Since socket/port exection now is single-threaded the use of port_lock
is not needed any more, so we can safely replace the two functions with
their lock-free counterparts.

In this commit, we remove the two functions. Furthermore, the contents
of __tipc_port_disconnect() is so trivial that we choose to eliminate
that function too, expanding its functionality into tipc_shutdown().
__tipc_port_connect() is simplified, moved to socket.c, and given the
more correct name tipc_sk_finish_conn(). Finally, we eliminate the
function auto_connect(), and expand its contents into filter_connect().
