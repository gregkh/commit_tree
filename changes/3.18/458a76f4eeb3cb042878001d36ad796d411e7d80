staging: comedi: adl_pci9118: use comedi_subdevice 'readback'

Use the new comedi_subdevice 'readback' member and the core provided
(*insn_read) for the readback of the analog output subdevice channels.

The board is "reset" prior to the subdevice init. Part of this reset
sets all the analog output channels to 0V. Move the initialization of
the 'readback' values after the 'readback' member has been allocated.
