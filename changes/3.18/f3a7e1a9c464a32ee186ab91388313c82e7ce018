sched/dl: Fix preemption checks

1) switched_to_dl() check is wrong. We reschedule only
   if rq->curr is deadline task, and we do not reschedule
   if it's a lower priority task. But we must always
   preempt a task of other classes.

2) dl_task_timer():
   Policy does not change in case of priority inheritance.
   rt_mutex_setprio() changes prio, while policy remains old.

So we lose some balancing logic in dl_task_timer() and
switched_to_dl() when we check policy instead of priority. Boosted
task may be rq->curr.

(I didn't change switched_from_dl() because no check is necessary
there at all).

I've looked at this place(switched_to_dl) several times and even fixed
this function, but found just now...  I suppose some performance tests
may work better after this.
