sparc64: mem boot option correction

The "mem" boot option can result in many unexpected consequences. This patch
attempts to prevent boot hangs which have been experienced on T4-4 and T5-8.
Basically the boot loader allocates vmlinuz and initrd higher in available
OBP physical memory. For example, on a 2Tb T5-8 it isn't possible to boot
with mem=20G.

The patch utilizes memblock to avoid reserved regions and trim memory which
is only free. Other improvements are possible for a multi-node machine.

This is a snippet of the boot log with mem=20G on T5-8 with the patch applied:
