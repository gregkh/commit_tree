openvswitch: Fix NDP flow mask validation

match_validate() enforce that a mask matching on NDP attributes has also an
exact match on ICMPv6 type.
The ICMPv6 type, which is 8-bit wide, is stored in the 'tp.src' field of
'struct sw_flow_key', which is 16-bit wide.
Therefore, an exact match on ICMPv6 type should only check the first 8 bits.

This commit fixes a bug that prevented flows with an exact match on NDP field
from being installed
Introduced by commit 03f0d916aa03 ("openvswitch: Mega flow implementation").
