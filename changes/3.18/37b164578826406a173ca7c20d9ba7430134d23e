tty: Fix high cpu load if tty is unreleaseable

Kernel oops can cause the tty to be unreleaseable (for example, if
n_tty_read() crashes while on the read_wait queue). This will cause
tty_release() to endlessly loop without sleeping.

Use a killable sleep timeout which grows by 2n+1 jiffies over the interval
[0, 120 secs.) and then jumps to forever (but still killable).

NB: killable just allows for the task to be rewoken manually, not
to be terminated.
