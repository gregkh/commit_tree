x86, apic: Handle a bad TSC more gracefully

If the TSC is unusable or disabled, then this patch fixes:

 - Confusion while trying to clear old APIC interrupts.
 - Division by zero and incorrect programming of the TSC deadline
   timer.

This fixes boot if the CPU has a TSC deadline timer but a missing or
broken TSC.  The failure to boot can be observed with qemu using
-cpu qemu64,-tsc,+tsc-deadline

This also happens to me in nested KVM for unknown reasons.
With this patch, I can boot cleanly (although without a TSC).
