slab: fix nodeid bounds check for non-contiguous node IDs

The bounds check for nodeid in ____cache_alloc_node gives false
positives on machines where the node IDs are not contiguous, leading to
a panic at boot time.  For example, on a POWER8 machine the node IDs are
typically 0, 1, 16 and 17.  This means that num_online_nodes() returns
4, so when ____cache_alloc_node is called with nodeid = 16 the VM_BUG_ON
triggers, like this:

  kernel BUG at /home/paulus/kernel/kvm/mm/slab.c:3079!
  Call Trace:
    .____cache_alloc_node+0x5c/0x270 (unreliable)
    .kmem_cache_alloc_node_trace+0xdc/0x360
    .init_list+0x3c/0x128
    .kmem_cache_init+0x1dc/0x258
    .start_kernel+0x2a0/0x568
    start_here_common+0x20/0xa8

To fix this, we instead compare the nodeid with MAX_NUMNODES, and
additionally make sure it isn't negative (since nodeid is an int).  The
check is there mainly to protect the array dereference in the get_node()
call in the next line, and the array being dereferenced is of size
MAX_NUMNODES.  If the nodeid is in range but invalid (for example if the
node is off-line), the BUG_ON in the next line will catch that.
