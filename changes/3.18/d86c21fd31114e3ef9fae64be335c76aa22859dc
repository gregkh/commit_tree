mfd: cros_ec: wait for completion of commands that return IN_PROGRESS

When an EC command returns EC_RES_IN_PROGRESS, we need to query
the state of the EC until it indicates that it is no longer busy.
Do this in cros_ec_cmd_xfer() under the EC's mutex so that other
commands (e.g. keyboard, I2C passtru) aren't issued to the EC while
it is working on the in-progress command.

The 10 milliseconds delay and the number of retries are the values
that were used by the flashrom tool when retrying commands.
