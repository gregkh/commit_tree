fm10k: Add support for IEEE DCBx

This patch adds support for management of the limited QOS features of the
FM10000 interface.  Specifically we can support up to 8 traffic classes,
however the part only provides 1 Rx and 1 Tx FIFO in the host interface and
as a result this can lead to head-of-line blocking on Rx.  This can be
avoided by setting PFC only for priorities that cannot afford to drop
frames.
