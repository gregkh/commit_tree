ARM: dts: vf610-colibri: split device tree for carrier boards

The Colibri VF61 is a module which needs a carrier board to actually
run. Different carrier board have different hardware support, hence
we should reflect this in the device tree files. This patch adds the
Colibri Evaluation Board, which supports almost all peripherals
defined in the Colibri standard.

Also align the compatible naming, file splitting and file naming with
the scheme which was choosen for the Tegra based modules.
