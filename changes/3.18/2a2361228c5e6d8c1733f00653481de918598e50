um: ubd: Fix for processes stuck in D state forever

Starting with Linux 3.12 processes get stuck in D state forever in
UserModeLinux under sync heavy workloads. This bug was introduced by
commit 805f11a0d5 (um: ubd: Add REQ_FLUSH suppport).
Fix bug by adding a check if FLUSH request was successfully submitted to
the I/O thread and keeping the FLUSH request on the request queue on
submission failures.
