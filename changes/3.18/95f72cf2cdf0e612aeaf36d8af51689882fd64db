ALSA: hda - Sort input pins depending on amp caps

If one input has a boost and another one has not, and they're equal
otherwise, it's more likely you want to use the input with the boost
as your primary input.

See hda-emu.git/codecs/canonical/cx20590-lenovo-20b2z00bus-ccert-201305-13496
for an example.
