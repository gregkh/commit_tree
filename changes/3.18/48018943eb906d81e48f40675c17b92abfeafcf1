mfd: wm5102: Mark register write sequencer control 3 readable

During init the core checks if the wm5102 has finished starting by reading
register 0x19 and looking at the value. This read always fails since this
is not a readable register, mark it as being one. While we're at it provide
a constant for the register name (as supplied by Charles Keepax).
