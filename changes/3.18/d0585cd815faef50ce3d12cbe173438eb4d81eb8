sb_edac: Claim a different PCI device

sb_edac controls a large number of different PCI functions.  Rather
than registering as a normal PCI driver for all of them, it
registers for just one so that it gets probed and, at probe time, it
looks for all the others.

Coincidentally, the device it registers for also contains the SMBUS
registers, so the PCI core will refuse to probe both sb_edac and a
future iMC SMBUS driver.  The drivers don't actually conflict, so
just change sb_edac's device table to probe a different device.

An alternative fix would be to merge the two drivers, but sb_edac
will also refuse to load on non-ECC systems, whereas i2c_imc would
still be useful without ECC.

The only user-visible change should be that sb_edac appears to bind
a different device.
