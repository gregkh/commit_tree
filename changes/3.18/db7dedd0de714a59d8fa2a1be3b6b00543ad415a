arm64: KVM: Handle traps of ICC_SRE_EL1 as RAZ/WI

When running on a system with a GICv3, we currenly don't allow the guest
to access the system register interface of the GICv3.  We do this by
clearing the ICC_SRE_EL2.Enable, which causes all guest accesses to
ICC_SRE_EL1 to trap to EL2 and causes all guest accesses to other ICC_
registers to cause an undefined exception in the guest.

However, we currently don't handle the trap of guest accesses to
ICC_SRE_EL1 and will spill out a warning.  The trap just needs to handle
the access as RAZ/WI, and a guest that tries to prod this register and
set ICC_SRE_EL1.SRE=1, must read back the value (which Linux already
does) to see if it succeeded, and will thus observe that ICC_SRE_EL1.SRE
was not set.

Add the simple trap handler in the sorted table of the system registers.
