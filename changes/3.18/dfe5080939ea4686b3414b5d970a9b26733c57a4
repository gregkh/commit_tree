ext4: drop EXT4_EX_NOFREE_ON_ERR from rest of extents handling code

Drop EXT4_EX_NOFREE_ON_ERR from ext4_ext_create_new_leaf(),
ext4_split_extent(), ext4_convert_unwritten_extents_endio().

This requires fixing all of their callers to potentially
ext4_ext_find_extent() to free the struct ext4_ext_path object in case
of an error, and there are interlocking dependencies all the way up to
ext4_ext_map_blocks(), ext4_swap_extents(), and
ext4_ext_remove_space().

Once this is done, we can drop the EXT4_EX_NOFREE_ON_ERR flag since it
is no longer necessary.
