random32: improvements to prandom_bytes

This patch addresses a couple of minor items, mostly addesssing
prandom_bytes(): 1) prandom_bytes{,_state}() should use size_t
for length arguments, 2) We can use put_unaligned() when filling
the array instead of open coding it [ perhaps some archs will
further benefit from their own arch specific implementation when
GCC cannot make up for it ], 3) Fix a typo, 4) Better use unsigned
int as type for getting the arch seed, 5) Make use of
prandom_u32_max() for timer slack.

Regarding the change to put_unaligned(), callers of prandom_bytes()
which internally invoke prandom_bytes_state(), don't bother as
they expect the array to be filled randomly and don't have any
control of the internal state what-so-ever (that's also why we
have periodic reseeding there, etc), so they really don't care.

Now for the direct callers of prandom_bytes_state(), which
are solely located in test cases for MTD devices, that is,
drivers/mtd/tests/{oobtest.c,pagetest.c,subpagetest.c}:

These tests basically fill a test write-vector through
prandom_bytes_state() with an a-priori defined seed each time
and write that to a MTD device. Later on, they set up a read-vector
and read back that blocks from the device. So in the verification
phase, the write-vector is being re-setup [ so same seed and
prandom_bytes_state() called ], and then memcmp()'ed against the
read-vector to check if the data is the same.

Akinobu, Lothar and I also tested this patch and it runs through
the 3 relevant MTD test cases w/o any errors on the nandsim device
(simulator for MTD devs) for x86_64, ppc64, ARM (i.MX28, i.MX53
and i.MX6):

  # modprobe nandsim first_id_byte=0x20 second_id_byte=0xac \
                     third_id_byte=0x00 fourth_id_byte=0x15
  # modprobe mtd_oobtest dev=0
  # modprobe mtd_pagetest dev=0
  # modprobe mtd_subpagetest dev=0

We also don't have any users depending directly on a particular
result of the PRNG (except the PRNG self-test itself), and that's
just fine as it e.g. allowed us easily to do things like upgrading
from taus88 to taus113.
