arm: dts: Add Altera SDRAM EDAC bindings & devicetree entries.

Add the Altera SDRAM EDAC bindings and device tree changes to the Altera SoC
project.

There was a discussion thread on whether this driver should be an mfd driver
or just make use of syscon, which is already a mfd. Ultimately, the
decision to use a simple syscon interface was reached.[1]
