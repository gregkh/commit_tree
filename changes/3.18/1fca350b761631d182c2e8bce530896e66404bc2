rtlwifi: Fix possible unaligned array in ether_addr_copy()

Two macros used to copy BSSID information use ether_addr_copy(), thus
the arrays must be 2-byte aligned. In one case, the array could become
unaligned if the struct containing it were changed. Use the __unaligned(2)
attribute to retain the necessary alignment. In addition, the magic number
used to specify the size of the array is replaced by ETH_ALEN.
