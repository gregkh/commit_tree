clk: mvebu: armada-370: Fix timer drift caused by the SSCG deviation

This commit activates the SSCG deviation correction for the Armada
370. It uses the optional function introduced by the commit "clk:
mvebu: Fix clk frequency value if SSCG is enabled".

Without this fix the deviation measured on a Mirabox was of a few
second each hour, whereas with this fix it was reduced at around
50ppm (around 4s per day).
