drm/bochs: downgrade pci_request_region failure from error to warning

Shutdown of firmware framebuffer has a bunch of problems.  Because
of this the framebuffer region might still be reserved even after
drm_fb_helper_remove_conflicting_pci_framebuffers() returned.

Don't consider pci_request_region() failure for the framebuffer
region as fatal error to workaround this issue.
