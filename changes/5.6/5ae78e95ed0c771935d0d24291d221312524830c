KVM: x86: Add dedicated emulator helpers for querying CPUID features

Add feature-specific helpers for querying guest CPUID support from the
emulator instead of having the emulator do a full CPUID and perform its
own bit tests.  The primary motivation is to eliminate the emulator's
usage of bit() so that future patches can add more extensive build-time
assertions on the usage of bit() without having to expose yet more code
to the emulator.

Note, providing a generic guest_cpuid_has() to the emulator doesn't work
due to the existing built-time assertions in guest_cpuid_has(), which
require the feature being checked to be a compile-time constant.

No functional change intended.
