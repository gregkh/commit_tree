mptcp: fix use-after-free for ipv6

Turns out that when we accept a new subflow, the newly created
inet_sk(tcp_sk)->pinet6 points at the ipv6_pinfo structure of the
listener socket.

This wasn't caught by the selftest because it closes the accepted fd
before the listening one.

adding a close(listenfd) after accept returns is enough:
 BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in inet6_getname+0x6ba/0x790
 Read of size 1 at addr ffff88810e310866 by task mptcp_connect/2518

  inet6_getname+0x6ba/0x790

  __x64_sys_getpeername+0x6f/0xb0

also alter test program to exercise this.
