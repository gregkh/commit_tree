crypto: x86 - Regularize glue function prototypes

The crypto glue performed function prototype casting via macros to make
indirect calls to assembly routines. Instead of performing casts at the
call sites (which trips Control Flow Integrity prototype checking), switch
each prototype to a common standard set of arguments which allows the
removal of the existing macros. In order to keep pointer math unchanged,
internal casting between u128 pointers and u8 pointers is added.
