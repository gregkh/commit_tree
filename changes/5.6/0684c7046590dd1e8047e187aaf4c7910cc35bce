irqchip/gic-v4.1: Don't use the VPE proxy if RVPEID is set

The infamous VPE proxy device isn't used with GICv4.1 because:
- we can invalidate any LPI from the DirectLPI MMIO interface
- the ITS and redistributors understand the life cycle of
  the doorbell, so we don't need to enable/disable it all
  the time

So let's escape early from the proxy related functions.
