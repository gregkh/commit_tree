KVM: s390: Cleanup initial cpu reset

The code seems to be quite old and uses lots of unneeded spaces for
alignment, which doesn't really help with readability.

Let's:
* Get rid of the extra spaces
* Remove the ULs as they are not needed on 0s
* Define constants for the CR 0 and 14 initial values
* Use the sizeof of the gcr array to memset it to 0
