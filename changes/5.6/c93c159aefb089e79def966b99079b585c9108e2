soc: fsl: qe: avoid IS_ERR_VALUE in ucc_fast.c

When building this on a 64-bit platform gcc rightly warns that the
error checking is broken (-ENOMEM stored in an u32 does not compare
greater than (unsigned long)-MAX_ERRNO). Instead, change the
ucc_fast_[tr]x_virtual_fifo_base_offset members to s32 and use an
ordinary check-for-negative. Also, this avoids treating 0 as "this
cannot have been returned from qe_muram_alloc() so don't free it".
