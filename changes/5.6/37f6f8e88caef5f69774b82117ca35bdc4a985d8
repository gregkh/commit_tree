powerpc/powernv: Allow manually invoking special reboots

OPAL provides several different kinds of reboot for the kernel to use,
namely forcing a full reboot, platform error reboot and MPIPL. Right now
triggering the alternative resets requires some ad-hoc method such as
triggering a kernel crash and hoping the stars align. It's sometimes handy
to be able to trigger one of these resets directly, so add a way to do
that.
