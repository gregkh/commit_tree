net: atlantic: fix use after free kasan warn

skb->len is used to calculate statistics after xmit invocation.

Under a stress load it may happen that skb will be xmited,
rx interrupt will come and skb will be freed, all before xmit function
is even returned.

Eventually, skb->len will access unallocated area.

Moving stats calculation into tx_clean routine.
