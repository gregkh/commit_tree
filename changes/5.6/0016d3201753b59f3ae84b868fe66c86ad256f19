nl80211: fix NL80211_ATTR_CHANNEL_WIDTH attribute type

The new opmode notification used this attribute with a u8, when
it's documented as a u32 and indeed used in userspace as such,
it just happens to work on little-endian systems since userspace
isn't doing any strict size validation, and the u8 goes into the
lower byte. Fix this.
