media: sun4i-csi: Add support for A10 CSI1 camera sensor interface

The A10/A20 Allwinner SoCs have two camera sensor interface blocks,
named CSI0 and CSI1. The two have the same register layouts with
slightly different features:

  - CSI0 has an image signal processor (ISP); CSI1 doesn't

  - CSI0 can support up to four separate channels under CCIR656;
    CSI1 can only support one

  - CSI0 can support up to 16-bit wide bus with YUV422;
    CSI1 can support up to 24-bit wide bus with YUV444

For now the driver doesn't support wide busses, nor CCIR656. So the
only relevant difference is whether a clock needs to be taken and
enabled for the ISP.

Add structs to record the differences, tie them to the compatible
strings, and deal with the ISP clock. Support for the new CSI1
hardware block is added as well.
