libbpf: Allow to augment system Kconfig through extra optional config

Instead of all or nothing approach of overriding Kconfig file location, allow
to extend it with extra values and override chosen subset of values though
optional user-provided extra config, passed as a string through open options'
.kconfig option. If same config key is present in both user-supplied config
and Kconfig, user-supplied one wins. This allows applications to more easily
test various conditions despite host kernel's real configuration. If all of
BPF object's __kconfig externs are satisfied from user-supplied config, system
Kconfig won't be read at all.

Simplify selftests by not needing to create temporary Kconfig files.
