arm64: dts: allwinner: h5: Add Libre Computer ALL-H5-CC H5 board

The Libre Computer ALL-H5-CC board is an upgraded version of the
ALL-H3-CC. Changes include:

  - Gigabit Ethernet via external RTL8211E Ethernet PHY
  - 16 MiB SPI NOR flash memory
  - PoE tap header
  - Line out jack removed

Only H5 variant test samples were made available, and the vendor is not
certain whether other SoC variants would be made or not. Furthermore the
board is a minor upgrade compared to the ALL-H3-CC. Thus the device tree
simply includes the one for the ALL-H3-CC, and adds the changes on top.
