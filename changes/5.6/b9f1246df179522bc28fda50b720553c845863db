drm/amd/display: Collapse resource arrays when pipe is disabled

[Why]
Currently, pipe resources are assigned to an index that matches the pipe position.
However, if pipe 1 or 2 is disabled, there will be a gap in the arrays which causes a crash when iterating based on pipe_count.

[How]
Fix resource construct to assign resources to minimum available array index.
