include/linux/memory.h: drop fields 'hw' and 'phys_callback' from struct memory_block

memory_block structure elements 'hw' and 'phys_callback' are not getting
used.  This was originally added with commit 3947be1969a9 ("[PATCH]
memory hotplug: sysfs and add/remove functions") but never seem to have
been used.  Just drop them now.
