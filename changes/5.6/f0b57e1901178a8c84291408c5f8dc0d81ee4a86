Input: elants_i2c - check Remark ID when attempting firmware update

To avoid flashing incompatible firmware onto a device we should check
whether "Remark ID" in firmware matches with the one in the controller.
This function is supported by Elan's latest version of boot code, so the
driver decides whether to perform the check based on the boot code version.
