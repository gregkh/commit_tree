ACPI: EC: Reference count query handlers under lock

There is a race condition in acpi_ec_get_query_handler()
theoretically allowing query handlers to go away before refernce
counting them.

In order to avoid it, call kref_get() on query handlers under
ec->mutex.

Also simplify the code a bit while at it.
