audit: Add __rcu annotation to RCU pointer

Add __rcu annotation to RCU-protected global pointer auditd_conn.

auditd_conn is an RCU-protected global pointer,i.e., accessed
via RCU methods rcu_dereference() and rcu_assign_pointer(),
hence it must be annotated with __rcu for sparse to report
warnings/errors correctly.

Fix multiple instances of the sparse error:
error: incompatible types in comparison expression
(different address spaces)
