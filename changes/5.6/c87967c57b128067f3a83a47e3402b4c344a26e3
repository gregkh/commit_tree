dt-bindings: Create DT bindings for PATA controllers

I need to create subnodes for drives connected to PATA
host controllers, and this needs to be supported generally,
so create a common YAML binding for "ide" that will support
subnodes with ports.

This has been designed as a subset of
ata/ahci-platform.txt with the bare essentials and
should be possible to extend or superset to cover the
common bindings.
