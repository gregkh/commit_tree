btrfs: remove struct find_free_extent.ram_bytes

This hasn't been used since it was first introduced in commit
b4bd745d1230 ("btrfs: Introduce find_free_extent_ctl structure for later
rework"). Passing that to btrfs_add_reserved_bytes in find_free_extent
is not strictly necessary and using the local ram_bytes instead seems
cleaner.
