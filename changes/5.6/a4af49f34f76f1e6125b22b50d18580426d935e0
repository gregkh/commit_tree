powerpc/pcidn: Warn when sriov pci_dn management is used incorrectly

These functions can only be used on a SR-IOV capable physical function and
they're only called in pcibios_sriov_enable / disable. Make them emit a
warning in the future if they're used incorrectly and remove the dead
code that checks if the device is a VF.
