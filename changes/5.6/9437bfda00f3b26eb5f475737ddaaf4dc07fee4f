ASoC: atmel: fix atmel_ssc_set_audio link failure

The ssc audio driver can call into both pdc and dma backends.  With the
latest rework, the logic to do this in a safe way avoiding link errors
was removed, bringing back link errors that were fixed long ago in commit
061981ff8cc8 ("ASoC: atmel: properly select dma driver state") such as

sound/soc/atmel/atmel_ssc_dai.o: In function `atmel_ssc_set_audio':
atmel_ssc_dai.c:(.text+0xac): undefined reference to `atmel_pcm_pdc_platform_register'

Fix it this time using Makefile hacks and a comment to prevent this
from accidentally getting removed again rather than Kconfig hacks.
