intel_idle: Allow ACPI _CST to be used for selected known processors

Update the intel_idle driver to get the C-states information from ACPI
_CST in some cases in which the processor is known to the driver, as long as
that information is available and the new use_acpi flag is set in the
profile of the processor in question.

In the cases when there is a specific table of C-states for the given
processor in the driver, that table is used as the primary source of
information on the available C-states, but if ACPI _CST is present,
the C-states that are not listed by it will not be enabled by default
(they still can be enabled later by user space via sysfs, though).

The new CPUIDLE_FLAG_ALWAYS_ENABLE flag can be used for marking
C-states that should be enabled by default even if they are not
listed by ACPI _CST.
