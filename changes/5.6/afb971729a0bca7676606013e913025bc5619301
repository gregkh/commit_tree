mm/huge_memory.c: reduce critical section protected by split_queue_lock

split_queue_lock protects data in struct deferred_split.  We can release
the lock after delete the page from deferred_split_queue.

This patch moves the THP accounting out of the lock protection, which is
introduced in commit 65c453778aea ("mm, rmap: account shmem thp pages").
