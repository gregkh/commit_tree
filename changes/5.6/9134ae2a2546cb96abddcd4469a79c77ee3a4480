nvme-rdma: Avoid double freeing of async event data

The timeout of identify cmd, which is invoked as part of admin queue
creation, can result in freeing of async event data both in
nvme_rdma_timeout handler and error handling path of
nvme_rdma_configure_admin queue thus causing NULL pointer reference.
