drm: Move EXPORT_SYMBOL_FOR_TESTS_ONLY under a separate Kconfig

Currently, we only export symbols for drm-selftests which are either
compiled as modules or into the main drm builtin. However, if we want to
export symbols from drm.ko for the drivers' selftests, we require a
means of controlling that export separately. So we add a new Kconfig to
determine whether or not the EXPORT_SYMBOL_FOR_TESTS_ONLY() takes
effect.
