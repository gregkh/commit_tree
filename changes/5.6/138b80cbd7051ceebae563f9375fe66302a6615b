drm/mediatek: Fix can't get component for external display plane.

The original logic is ok for primary display, but will not find out
component for external display.

For example, plane->index is 6 for external display, but there are only
2 layer nr in external display, and this condition will never happen:
if (plane->index < (count + mtk_ddp_comp_layer_nr(comp)))

Fix this by using the offset of the plane to mtk_crtc->planes as index,
instead of plane->index.
