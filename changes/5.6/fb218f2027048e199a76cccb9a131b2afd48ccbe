drm/i915/gt: Discard stale context state from across idling

Before we idle, on parking, we switch to the kernel context such that we
have a scratch context loaded while the GPU idle, protecting any
precious user state. Be paranoid and assume that the idle state may have
been trashed, and reset the kernel_context image after idling.
