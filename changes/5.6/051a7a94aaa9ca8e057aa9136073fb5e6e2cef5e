arm64: hibernate: use get_safe_page directly

create_safe_exec_page() uses hibernate's allocator to create a set of page
table to map a single page that will contain the relocation code.

Remove the allocator related arguments, and use get_safe_page directly, as
it is done in other local functions in this file to simplify function
prototype.

Removing this function pointer makes it easier to refactor the code later.
