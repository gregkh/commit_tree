drm/omapdrm: Drop dma_buf->k(un)map

No in-tree users left.

Note that this is one of the few (if only) implementations of dma-buf
that provided a kmap, but not a vmap implemenation. Given that the
only real user (in-tree at least) of kmap was tegra, and it's
impossible to buy a chip with tegra host1x and ompadrm on the same
SoC, there's no problem here.
