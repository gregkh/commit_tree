xsk: ixgbe: i40e: ice: mlx5: Xsk_umem_discard_addr to xsk_umem_release_addr

Change the name of xsk_umem_discard_addr to xsk_umem_release_addr to
better reflect the new naming of the AF_XDP queue manipulation
functions. As this functions is used by drivers implementing support
for AF_XDP zero-copy, it requires a name change to these drivers. The
function xsk_umem_release_addr_rq has also changed name in the same
fashion.
