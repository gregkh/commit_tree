selftests/bpf: Test freeing sockmap/sockhash with a socket in it

Commit 7e81a3530206 ("bpf: Sockmap, ensure sock lock held during tear
down") introduced sleeping issues inside RCU critical sections and while
holding a spinlock on sockmap/sockhash tear-down. There has to be at least
one socket in the map for the problem to surface.

This adds a test that triggers the warnings for broken locking rules. Not a
fix per se, but rather tooling to verify the accompanying fixes. Run on a
VM with 1 vCPU to reproduce the warnings.
