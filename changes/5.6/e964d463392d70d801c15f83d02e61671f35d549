ARM: dts: rockchip: Add missing cpu operating points for rk3288-tinker

The Tinker Board / S devices use a special chip variant called rk3288-c
and use different operating points with a higher max frequency.

So add the missing operating points for Tinker Board / S devices, also
increase the vdd_cpu regulator-max-microvolt to 1400000 uV so that the
cpu can operate at 1.8 GHz.
