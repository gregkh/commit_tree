arm64: armv8_deprecated: update the comments of armv8_deprecated_init()

In commit c0d8832e78cb ("arm64: Ensure the instruction emulation is
ready for userspace"), armv8_deprecated_init() was promoted to
core_initcall() but the comments were left unchanged, update it now.

Spotted by some random reading of the code.
