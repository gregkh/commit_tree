drm/i915/gt: Suppress threshold updates on RPS parking

When we park RPS, we set the GPU to run at minimum 'idle' frequency.
However, as the GPU is idle, we also disable the worker and RPS
interrupts - changing the RPS thresholds has no effect, it just incurs
extra changes to restore them when we unpark. So on parking, leave the
thresholds set to the current power level and so we expect them to be
valid for our restart.
