drm/modes: parse_cmdline: Accept extras directly after mode combined with options

Before this commit it was impossible to combine an extra mode argument
specified directly after the resolution with an option, e.g.
video=HDMI-1:720x480e,rotate=180 would not work, either the "e" to force
enable would need to be dropped or the ",rotate=180", otherwise the
mode_option would not be accepted.

This commit fixes this by setting parse_extras to true in this case, so
that drm_mode_parse_cmdline_res_mode() parses the extra arguments directly
after the resolution.
