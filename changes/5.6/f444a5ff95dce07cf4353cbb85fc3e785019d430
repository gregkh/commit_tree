x86/cpufeatures: Add support for fast short REP; MOVSB

>From the Intel Optimization Reference Manual:

3.7.6.1 Fast Short REP MOVSB
Beginning with processors based on Ice Lake Client microarchitecture,
REP MOVSB performance of short operations is enhanced. The enhancement
applies to string lengths between 1 and 128 bytes long.  Support for
fast-short REP MOVSB is enumerated by the CPUID feature flag: CPUID
[EAX=7H, ECX=0H).EDX.FAST_SHORT_REP_MOVSB[bit 4] = 1. There is no change
in the REP STOS performance.

Add an X86_FEATURE_FSRM flag for this.

memmove() avoids REP MOVSB for short (< 32 byte) copies. Check FSRM and
use REP MOVSB for short copies on systems that support it.
