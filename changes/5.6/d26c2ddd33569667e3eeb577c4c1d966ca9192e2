cifs: add SMB3 change notification support

A commonly used SMB3 feature is change notification, allowing an
app to be notified about changes to a directory. The SMB3
Notify request blocks until the server detects a change to that
directory or its contents that matches the completion flags
that were passed in and the "watch_tree" flag (which indicates
whether subdirectories under this directory should be also
included).  See MS-SMB2 2.2.35 for additional detail.

To use this simply pass in the following structure to ioctl:

 struct __attribute__((__packed__)) smb3_notify {
        uint32_t completion_filter;
        bool    watch_tree;
 } __packed;

 using CIFS_IOC_NOTIFY  0x4005cf09
 or equivalently _IOW(CIFS_IOCTL_MAGIC, 9, struct smb3_notify)

SMB3 change notification is supported by all major servers.
The ioctl will block until the server detects a change to that
directory or its subdirectories (if watch_tree is set).
