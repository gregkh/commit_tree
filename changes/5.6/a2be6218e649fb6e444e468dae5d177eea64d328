iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Improve add_device() error handling

Let add_device() clean up after itself. The iommu_bus_init() function
does call remove_device() on error, but other sites (e.g. of_iommu) do
not.

Don't free level-2 stream tables because we'd have to track if we
allocated each of them or if they are used by other endpoints. It's not
worth the hassle since they are managed resources.
