drm/i915/psr: Check if sink PSR capability changed

eDP specification states that sink can have its PSR capability
changed, I have never found any panel doing that but lets add that
for completeness.
For now it is not reading back the PSR capabilities and if possible
re-enabling PSR, this will be added if a panel is found using this
feature.

Cleaning DP_PSR_CAPS_CHANGE
