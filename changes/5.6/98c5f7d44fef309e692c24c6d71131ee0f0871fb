net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Forcibly configure IMP port for 1Gb/sec

We are still experiencing some packet loss with the existing advanced
congestion buffering (ACB) settings with the IMP port configured for
2Gb/sec, so revert to conservative link speeds that do not produce
packet loss until this is resolved.

Fixes: de34d7084edd ("net: dsa: bcm_sf2: Only 7278 supports 2Gb/sec IMP port")
