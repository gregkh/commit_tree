io_uring: retry raw bdev writes if we hit -EOPNOTSUPP

For non-blocking issue, we set IOCB_NOWAIT in the kiocb. However, on a
raw block device, this yields an -EOPNOTSUPP return, as non-blocking
writes aren't supported. Turn this -EOPNOTSUPP into -EAGAIN, so we retry
from blocking context with IOCB_NOWAIT cleared.
