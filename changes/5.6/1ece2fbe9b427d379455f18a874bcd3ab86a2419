ptp: clockmatrix: Rework clockmatrix version information.

Simplify and fix the version information displayed by the driver.
The new info better relects what is needed to support the hardware.

Prev:
Version: 4.8.0, Pipeline 22169 0x4001, Rev 0, Bond 5, CSR 311, IRQ 2

New:
Version: 4.8.0, Id: 0x4001  Hw Rev: 5  OTP Config Select: 15

- Remove pipeline, CSR and IRQ because version x.y.z already incorporates
  this information.
- Remove bond number because it is not used.
- Remove rev number because register was not implemented, always 0
- Add HW Rev ID register to replace rev number
- Add OTP config select to show the user configuration chosen by
  the configurable GPIO pins on start-up
