net/mlx5: E-Switch, Increase number of chains and priorities

Increase the number of chains and priorities to support
the whole range available in tc.

We use unmanaged tables and ignore flow level to create more
tables than what we declared to fs_core steering, and we manage
the connections between the tables themselves.

To support that we need FW with ignore_flow_level capability.
Otherwise the old behaviour will be used, where we are limited
by the number of levels we declared (4 chains, 16 prios).
