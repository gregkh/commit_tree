ASoC: Intel: common: add match tables for CNL/CFL/CML w/ SoundWire

The two configurations are with the Realtek 3-in-1 board requiring all
4 links to be enabled, or basic configuration with the on-board
RT700 using link1.

For now we only have definitions for CML. CNL and CFL are just
placeholders.
