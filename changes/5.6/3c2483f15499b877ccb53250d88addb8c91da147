KVM: arm/arm64: Correct CPSR on exception entry

When KVM injects an exception into a guest, it generates the CPSR value
from scratch, configuring CPSR.{M,A,I,T,E}, and setting all other
bits to zero.

This isn't correct, as the architecture specifies that some CPSR bits
are (conditionally) cleared or set upon an exception, and others are
unchanged from the original context.

This patch adds logic to match the architectural behaviour. To make this
simple to follow/audit/extend, documentation references are provided,
and bits are configured in order of their layout in SPSR_EL2. This
layout can be seen in the diagram on ARM DDI 0487E.a page C5-426.

Note that this code is used by both arm and arm64, and is intended to
fuction with the SPSR_EL2 and SPSR_HYP layouts.
