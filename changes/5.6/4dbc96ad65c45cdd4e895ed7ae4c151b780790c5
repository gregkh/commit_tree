scsi: aic7xxx: Adjust indentation in ahc_find_syncrate

Clang warns:

../drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_core.c:2317:5: warning: misleading
indentation; statement is not part of the previous 'if'
[-Wmisleading-indentation]
                        if ((syncrate->sxfr_u2 & ST_SXFR) != 0)
                        ^
../drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_core.c:2310:4: note: previous statement
is here
                        if (syncrate == &ahc_syncrates[maxsync])
                        ^
1 warning generated.

This warning occurs because there is a space amongst the tabs on this
line. Remove it so that the indentation is consistent with the Linux kernel
coding style and clang no longer warns.

This has been a problem since the beginning of git history hence no fixes
tag.
