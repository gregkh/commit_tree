xfs: Add __packed to xfs_dir2_sf_entry_t definition

xfs_check_ondisk_structs() verifies that the sizes of the data types
used by xfs are correct via the XFS_CHECK_STRUCT_SIZE() macro.

Since the structures padding can vary depending on the ABI (e.g. on
ARM OABI structures are padded to multiple of 32 bits), it may happen
that xfs_dir2_sf_entry_t size check breaks the compilation with the
assertion below:

In file included from linux/include/linux/string.h:6,
                 from linux/include/linux/uuid.h:12,
                 from linux/fs/xfs/xfs_linux.h:10,
                 from linux/fs/xfs/xfs.h:22,
                 from linux/fs/xfs/xfs_super.c:7:
In function ‘xfs_check_ondisk_structs’,
    inlined from ‘init_xfs_fs’ at linux/fs/xfs/xfs_super.c:2025:2:
linux/include/linux/compiler.h:350:38:
    error: call to ‘__compiletime_assert_107’ declared with attribute
    error: XFS: sizeof(xfs_dir2_sf_entry_t) is wrong, expected 3
    _compiletime_assert(condition, msg, __compiletime_assert_, __LINE__)

Restore the correct behavior adding __packed to the structure definition.
