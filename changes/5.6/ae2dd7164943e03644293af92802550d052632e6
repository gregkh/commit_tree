mptcp: handle tcp fallback when using syn cookies

We can't deal with syncookie mode yet, the syncookie rx path will create
tcp reqsk, i.e. we get OOB access because we treat tcp reqsk as mptcp reqsk one:

TCP: SYN flooding on port 20002. Sending cookies.
BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in subflow_syn_recv_sock+0x451/0x4d0 net/mptcp/subflow.c:191

 [..]

Bug can be reproduced via "sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies=2".

Note that MPTCP should work with syncookies (4th ack would carry needed
state), but it appears better to sort that out in -next so do tcp
fallback for now.

I removed the MPTCP ifdef for tcp_rsk "is_mptcp" member because
if (IS_ENABLED()) is easier to read than "#ifdef IS_ENABLED()/#endif" pair.
