powerpc/pseries: Allow not having ibm, hypertas-functions::hcall-multi-tce for DDW

By default a pseries guest supports a H_PUT_TCE hypercall which maps
a single IOMMU page in a DMA window. Additionally the hypervisor may
support H_PUT_TCE_INDIRECT/H_STUFF_TCE which update multiple TCEs at once;
this is advertised via the device tree /rtas/ibm,hypertas-functions
property which Linux converts to FW_FEATURE_MULTITCE.

FW_FEATURE_MULTITCE is checked when dma_iommu_ops is used; however
the code managing the huge DMA window (DDW) ignores it and calls
H_PUT_TCE_INDIRECT even if it is explicitly disabled via
the "multitce=off" kernel command line parameter.

This adds FW_FEATURE_MULTITCE checking to the DDW code path.

This changes tce_build_pSeriesLP to take liobn and page size as
the huge window does not have iommu_table descriptor which usually
the place to store these numbers.
