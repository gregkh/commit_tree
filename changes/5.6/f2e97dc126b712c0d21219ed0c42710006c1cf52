bpf: Selftests build error in sockmap_basic.c

Fix following build error. We could push a tcp.h header into one of the
include paths, but I think its easy enough to simply pull in the three
defines we need here. If we end up using more of tcp.h at some point
we can pull it in later.

/home/john/git/bpf/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/sockmap_basic.c: In function ‘connected_socket_v4’:
/home/john/git/bpf/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/sockmap_basic.c:20:11: error: ‘TCP_REPAIR_ON’ undeclared (first use in this function)
  repair = TCP_REPAIR_ON;
           ^
/home/john/git/bpf/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/sockmap_basic.c:20:11: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
/home/john/git/bpf/tools/testing/selftests/bpf/prog_tests/sockmap_basic.c:29:11: error: ‘TCP_REPAIR_OFF_NO_WP’ undeclared (first use in this function)
  repair = TCP_REPAIR_OFF_NO_WP;

Then with fix,

$ ./test_progs -n 44
#44/1 sockmap create_update_free:OK
#44/2 sockhash create_update_free:OK
#44 sockmap_basic:OK
