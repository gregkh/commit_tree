selftests/timens: Add a test for timerfd

Check that timerfd_create() takes into account clock offsets.

Output on success:
 1..3
 ok 1 clockid=7
 ok 2 clockid=1
 ok 3 clockid=9
 # Pass 3 Fail 0 Xfail 0 Xpass 0 Skip 0 Error 0

Output on failure:
 1..3
 not ok 1 clockid: 7 elapsed: 0
 not ok 2 clockid: 1 elapsed: 0
 not ok 3 clockid: 9 elapsed: 0
 Bail out!

Output with lack of permissions:
 1..3
 not ok 1 # SKIP need to run as root

Output without support of time namespaces:
 1..3
 not ok 1 # SKIP Time namespaces are not supported
