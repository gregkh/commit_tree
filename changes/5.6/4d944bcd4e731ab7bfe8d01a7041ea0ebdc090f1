apparmor: add AppArmor KUnit tests for policy unpack

Add KUnit tests to test AppArmor unpacking of userspace policies.
AppArmor uses a serialized binary format for loading policies. To find
policy format documentation see
Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/apparmor.rst.

In order to write the tests against the policy unpacking code, some
static functions needed to be exposed for testing purposes. One of the
goals of this patch is to establish a pattern for which testing these
kinds of functions should be done in the future.
