RDMA/mlx5: Simplify devx async commands

With the new FD structure the async commands do not need to hold any
references while running. The existing mlx5_cmd_exec_cb() and
mlx5_cmd_cleanup_async_ctx() provide enough synchronization to ensure
that all outstanding commands are completed before the uobject can be
destructed.

Remove the now confusing get_file() and the type erasure of the
devx_async_cmd_event_file.
