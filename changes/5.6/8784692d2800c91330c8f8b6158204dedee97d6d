ARM: dts: rockchip: Add brcm bluetooth for rk3288-veyron

This enables the Broadcom uart bluetooth driver on uart0 and gives it
ownership of its gpios. In order to use this, you must enable the
following kconfig options:
- CONFIG_BT_HCIUART_BCM
- CONFIG_SERIAL_DEV

This is applicable to rk3288-veyron series boards that use the bcm43540
wifi+bt chips.

As part of this change, also refactor the pinctrl across the various
boards. All the boards using broadcom bluetooth shouldn't touch the
bt_dev_wake pin.
