drm/i915/gt: Mark the execlists->active as the primary volatile access

Since we want to do a lockless read of the current active request, and
that request is written to by process_csb also without serialisation, we
need to instruct gcc to take care in reading the pointer itself.

Otherwise, we have observed execlists_active() to report 0x40.

[ 2400.760381] igt/para-4098    1..s. 2376479300us : process_csb: rcs0 cs-irq head=3, tail=4
[ 2400.760826] igt/para-4098    1..s. 2376479303us : process_csb: rcs0 csb[4]: status=0x00000001:0x00000000
[ 2400.761271] igt/para-4098    1..s. 2376479306us : trace_ports: rcs0: promote { b9c59:2622, b9c55:2624 }
[ 2400.761726] igt/para-4097    0d... 2376479311us : __i915_schedule: rcs0: -2147483648->3, inflight:0000000000000040, rq:ffff888208c1e940

which is impossible!

The answer is that as we keep the existing execlists->active pointing
into the array as we copy over that array, the unserialised read may see
a partial pointer value.
