net/mlx5: DR, Add support for multiple destination table action

A multiple destination table action allows HW packet duplication
to multiple destinations, this is useful for multicast or mirroring
traffic for debug. Duplicating is done using a FW flow table with
multiple destinations.

The new action creation function, mlx5dr_action_create_mult_dest_tbl
will allow creating a single table to iterate over several dr actions.
