Revert "arm64: kexec: make dtb_mem always enabled"

Adding crash dump support to 'kexec_file' is going to extend 'struct
kimage_arch' with more 'kexec_file'-specific members. The cleanup here
then starts to get in the way, so revert it.

This reverts commit 621516789ee6e285cb2088fe4706eedd030d38bf.
