drm/mst: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference in drm_dp_mst_process_up_req()

According to DP specification, DP_SINK_EVENT_NOTIFY is also a
broadcast message but as this function only handles
DP_CONNECTION_STATUS_NOTIFY I will only make the static
analyzer that caught this issue happy by not calling
drm_dp_get_mst_branch_device_by_guid() with a NULL guid, causing
drm_dp_mst_process_up_req() to return in the "if (!mstb)" right
bellow.
