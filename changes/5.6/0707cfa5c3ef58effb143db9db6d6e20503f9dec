driver core: platform: fix u32 greater or equal to zero comparison

Currently the check that a u32 variable i is >= 0 is always true because
the unsigned variable will never be negative, causing the loop to run
forever.  Fix this by changing the pre-decrement check to a zero check on
i followed by a decrement of i.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
