gfs2: fix O_SYNC write handling

In gfs2_file_write_iter, for direct writes, the error checking in the buffered
write fallback case is incomplete.  This can cause inode write errors to go
undetected.  Fix and clean up gfs2_file_write_iter along the way.

Based on a proposed fix by Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>.
