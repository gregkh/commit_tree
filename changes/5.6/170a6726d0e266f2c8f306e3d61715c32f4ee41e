usb: typec: ucsi: add support for separate DP altmode devices

CCGx controller used on NVIDIA GPU card has two separate display
altmode for two DP pin assignments. UCSI specification doesn't
prohibits using separate display altmode.

Current UCSI Type-C framework expects only one display altmode for
all DP pin assignment. This patch squashes two separate display
altmode into single altmode to support controllers with separate
display altmode. We first read all the alternate modes of connector
and then run through it to know if there are separate display
altmodes. If so, it prepares a new port altmode set after squashing
two or more separate altmodes into one.
