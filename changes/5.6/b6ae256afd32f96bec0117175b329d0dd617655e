KVM: arm64: Only sign-extend MMIO up to register width

On AArch64 you can do a sign-extended load to either a 32-bit or 64-bit
register, and we should only sign extend the register up to the width of
the register as specified in the operation (by using the 32-bit Wn or
64-bit Xn register specifier).

As it turns out, the architecture provides this decoding information in
the SF ("Sixty-Four" -- how cute...) bit.

Let's take advantage of this with the usual 32-bit/64-bit header file
dance and do the right thing on AArch64 hosts.
