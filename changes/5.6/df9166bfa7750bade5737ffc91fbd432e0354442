scsi: lpfc: Fix: Rework setting of fdmi symbolic node name registration

This patch reworks the fdmi symbolic node name data for the following two
issues:

 - Correcting extraneous periods following the DV and HN fdmi data fields.

 - Avoiding buffer overflow issues when formatting the data.

The fix to the fist issue is to just remove the characters.

The fix to the second issue has all data being staged in temporary storage
before being moved to the real buffer.
