fs/binfmt_elf.c: coredump: allow process with empty address space to coredump

Unmapping whole address space at once with

	munmap(0, (1ULL<<47) - 4096)

or equivalent will create empty coredump.

It is silly way to exit, however registers content may still be useful.

The right to coredump is fundamental right of a process!
