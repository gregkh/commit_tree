drm/i915: Eliminate the trylock for awaiting an earlier request

We currently use an error-prone mutex_trylock to grab another timeline
to find an earlier request along it. However, with a bit of a
sleight-of-hand, we can reduce the mutex_trylock to a spin_lock on the
immediate request and careful pointer chasing to acquire a reference on
the previous request.
