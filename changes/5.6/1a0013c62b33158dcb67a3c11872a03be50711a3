interconnect: Add interconnect_graph file to debugfs

The interconnect graphs can be difficult to understand and the current
"interconnect_summary" file doesn't even display links in any way.

Add a new "interconnect_graph" file to debugfs in the graphviz "dot"
format which describes interconnect providers, nodes and links.

The file is human-readable and can be visualized by piping through
graphviz. Example:

ssh $TARGET cat /sys/kernel/debug/interconnect/interconnect_graph \
	| dot -Tsvg > interconnect_graph.svg
