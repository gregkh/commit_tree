soc/tegra: fuse: Fix build with Tegra194 configuration

If only Tegra194 support is enabled, the tegra30_fuse_read() and
tegra30_fuse_init() function are not declared and cause a build failure.
Add Tegra194 to the preprocessor guard to make sure these functions are
available for Tegra194-only builds as well.
