drm/i915/selftests: Flush the active callbacks

Before checking the current i915_active state for the asynchronous work
we submitted, flush any ongoing callback. This ensures that our sampling
is robust and does not sporadically fail due to bad timing as the work
is running on another cpu.

v2: Drop the fence callback sync, retiring under the lock should be good
enough to synchronize with engine_retire() and the
intel_gt_retire_requests() background worker.
