openvswitch: New MPLS actions for layer 2 tunnelling

The existing PUSH MPLS action inserts MPLS header between ethernet header
and the IP header. Though this behaviour is fine for L3 VPN where an IP
packet is encapsulated inside a MPLS tunnel, it does not suffice the L2
VPN (l2 tunnelling) requirements. In L2 VPN the MPLS header should
encapsulate the ethernet packet.

The new mpls action ADD_MPLS inserts MPLS header at the start of the
packet or at the start of the l3 header depending on the value of l3 tunnel
flag in the ADD_MPLS arguments.

POP_MPLS action is extended to support ethertype 0x6558.
