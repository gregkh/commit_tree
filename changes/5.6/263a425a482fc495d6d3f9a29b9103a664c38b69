net: systemport: Avoid RBUF stuck in Wake-on-LAN mode

After a number of suspend and resume cycles, it is possible for the RBUF
to be stuck in Wake-on-LAN mode, despite the MPD enable bit being
cleared which instructed the RBUF to exit that mode.

Avoid creating that problematic condition by clearing the RX_EN and
TX_EN bits in the UniMAC prior to disable the Magic Packet Detector
logic which is guaranteed to make the RBUF exit Wake-on-LAN mode.
