x86/hyperv: Suspend/resume the hypercall page for hibernation

For hibernation the hypercall page must be disabled before the hibernation
image is created so that subsequent hypercall operations fail safely. On
resume the hypercall page has to be restored and reenabled to ensure proper
operation of the resumed kernel.

Implement the necessary suspend/resume callbacks.
