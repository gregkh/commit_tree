drm/tilcdc: Remove obsolete bundled tilcdc tfp410 driver

Remove obsolete bundled tfp410 driver with its "ti,tilcdc,tfp410"
devicetree binding. No platform has ever used this driver in the
mainline kernel and if anybody connects tfp410 to tilcdc he or she
should use the generic drm tfp410 bridge driver.
