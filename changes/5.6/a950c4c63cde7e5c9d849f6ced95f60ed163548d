ARM: dts: rockchip: Use ABI name for recovery mode pin on veyron fievel/tiger

The recovery mode pin is currently named 'REC_MODE_L', which is
how the signal is called in the schematics. The Chrome OS ABI
requires the pin to be named 'RECOVERY_SW_L', which is also how
it is called on all other veyron devices. Rename the pin to match
the ABI.
