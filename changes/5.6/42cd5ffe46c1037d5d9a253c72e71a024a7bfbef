usb: dwc3: debug: fix string position formatting mixup with ret and len

Currently the string formatting is mixing up the offset of ret and
len. Re-work the code to use just len, remove ret and use scnprintf
instead of snprintf and len position accumulation where required.
Remove the -ve return check since scnprintf never returns a failure
-ve size. Also break overly long lines to clean up checkpatch
warnings.
