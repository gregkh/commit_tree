staging: wfx: simplify hif_set_rcpi_rssi_threshold() usage

The structure hif_mib_rcpi_rssi_threshold come from hardware API. It is
not intended to be manipulated in upper layers of the driver.

In add, current code for hif_set_rcpi_rssi_threshold() is dumb. It
should pack data using the hardware representation instead of leaving
all work to the caller.
