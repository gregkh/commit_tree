crypto: api - Do not zap spawn->alg

Currently when a spawn is removed we will zap its alg field.
This is racy because the spawn could belong to an unregistered
instance which may dereference the spawn->alg field.

This patch fixes this by keeping spawn->alg constant and instead
adding a new spawn->dead field to indicate that a spawn is going
away.
