bpf/btf: Fix BTF verification of enum members in struct/union

btf_enum_check_member() was currently sure to recognize the size of
"enum" type members in struct/union as the size of "int" even if
its size was packed.

This patch fixes BTF enum verification to use the correct size
of member in BPF programs.
