iio: buffer-dmaengine: Report buffer length requirements

The dmaengine buffer has some length alignment requirements that can differ
from platform to platform. If the length alignment requirements are not met
unexpected behavior like dropping of samples can occur.

Currently these requirements are not reported and applications need to know
the requirements of the platform by some out-of-band means.

Add a new buffer attribute that reports the length alignment requirements
called `length_align_bytes`. The reported length alignment is in bytes that
means the buffer length alignment in sample sets depends on the number of
enabled channels and the bytes per channel. Applications using this
attribute to determine the buffer size requirements need to consider this.
