cpufreq: Fix policy initialization for internal governor drivers

Before commit 1e4f63aecb53 ("cpufreq: Avoid creating excessively
large stack frames") the initial value of the policy field in struct
cpufreq_policy set by the driver's ->init() callback was implicitly
passed from cpufreq_init_policy() to cpufreq_set_policy() if the
default governor was neither "performance" nor "powersave".  After
that commit, however, cpufreq_init_policy() must take that case into
consideration explicitly and handle it as appropriate, so make that
happen.
