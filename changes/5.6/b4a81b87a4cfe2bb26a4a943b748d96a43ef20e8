ecryptfs: fix a memory leak bug in ecryptfs_init_messaging()

In ecryptfs_init_messaging(), if the allocation for 'ecryptfs_msg_ctx_arr'
fails, the previously allocated 'ecryptfs_daemon_hash' is not deallocated,
leading to a memory leak bug. To fix this issue, free
'ecryptfs_daemon_hash' before returning the error.
