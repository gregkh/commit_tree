dt-bindings: phy: ti,phy-j721e-wiz: Add Type-C dir GPIO

This is an optional GPIO, if specified will be used to
swap lane 0 and lane 1 based on GPIO status. This is required
to achieve plug flip support for USB Type-C.

Type-C companions typically need some time after the cable is
plugged before and before they reflect the correct status of
Type-C plug orientation on the DIR line.

Type-C Spec specifies CC attachment debounce time (tCCDebounce)
of 100 ms (min) to 200 ms (max).

Allow the DT node to specify the time (in ms) that we need
to wait before sampling the DIR line.
