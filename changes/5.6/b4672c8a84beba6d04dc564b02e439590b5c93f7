amd/amdgpu: force to trigger a no-retry-fault after a retry-fault

Only for the debugger use case.

[why]
Avoid endless translation retries, after an invalid address access has
been issued to the GPU. Instead, the trap handler is forced to enter by
generating a no-retry-fault.
A s_trap instruction is inserted in the debugger case to let the wave to
enter trap handler to save context.

[how]
Intentionally using an invalid flag combination (F and P set at the same
time) to trigger a no-retry-fault, after a retry-fault happens. This is
only valid under compute context.
