binder: prevent UAF for binderfs devices

On binder_release(), binder_defer_work(proc, BINDER_DEFERRED_RELEASE) is
called which punts the actual cleanup operation to a workqueue. At some
point, binder_deferred_func() will be called which will end up calling
binder_deferred_release() which will retrieve and cleanup the
binder_context attach to this struct binder_proc.

If we trace back where this binder_context is attached to binder_proc we
see that it is set in binder_open() and is taken from the struct
binder_device it is associated with. This obviously assumes that the
struct binder_device that context is attached to is _never_ freed. While
that might be true for devtmpfs binder devices it is most certainly
wrong for binderfs binder devices.

So, assume binder_open() is called on a binderfs binder devices. We now
stash away the struct binder_context associated with that struct
binder_devices:
	proc->context = &binder_dev->context;
	/* binderfs stashes devices in i_private */
	if (is_binderfs_device(nodp)) {
		binder_dev = nodp->i_private;
		info = nodp->i_sb->s_fs_info;
		binder_binderfs_dir_entry_proc = info->proc_log_dir;
	} else {
	.
	.
	.
	proc->context = &binder_dev->context;

Now let's assume that the binderfs instance for that binder devices is
shutdown via umount() and/or the mount namespace associated with it goes
away. As long as there is still an fd open for that binderfs binder
device things are fine. But let's assume we now close the last fd for
that binderfs binder device. Now binder_release() is called and punts to
the workqueue. Assume that the workqueue has quite a bit of stuff to do
and doesn't get to cleaning up the struct binder_proc and the associated
struct binder_context with it for that binderfs binder device right
away. In the meantime, the VFS is killing the super block and is
ultimately calling sb->evict_inode() which means it will call
binderfs_evict_inode() which does:

static void binderfs_evict_inode(struct inode *inode)
{
	struct binder_device *device = inode->i_private;
	struct binderfs_info *info = BINDERFS_I(inode);

	clear_inode(inode);

	if (!S_ISCHR(inode->i_mode) || !device)
		return;

	mutex_lock(&binderfs_minors_mutex);
	--info->device_count;
	ida_free(&binderfs_minors, device->miscdev.minor);
	mutex_unlock(&binderfs_minors_mutex);

	kfree(device->context.name);
	kfree(device);
}

thereby freeing the struct binder_device including struct
binder_context.

Now the workqueue finally has time to get around to cleaning up struct
binder_proc and is now trying to access the associate struct
binder_context. Since it's already freed it will OOPs.

Fix this by holding an additional reference to the inode that is only
released once the workqueue is done cleaning up struct binder_proc. This
is an easy alternative to introducing separate refcounting on struct
binder_device which we can always do later if it becomes necessary.

This is an alternative fix to 51d8a7eca677 ("binder: prevent UAF read in
print_binder_transaction_log_entry()").
