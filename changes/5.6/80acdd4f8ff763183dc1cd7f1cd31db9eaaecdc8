ASoC: SOF: intel: hda: Modify signature for hda_codec_probe_bus()

The machine driver selection for HDA platforms will be
consolidated and moved out of the SOF DSP
probe callback. In preparation for that, modify the
signature for hda_codec_probe_bus() to pass the
hda_codec_use_common_hdmi as a variable while probing the
HDA codecs.
