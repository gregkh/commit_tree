bpf, offload: Replace bitwise AND by logical AND in bpf_prog_offload_info_fill

This if guards whether user-space wants a copy of the offload-jited
bytecode and whether this bytecode exists. By erroneously doing a bitwise
AND instead of a logical AND on user- and kernel-space buffer-size can lead
to no data being copied to user-space especially when user-space size is a
power of two and bigger then the kernel-space buffer.
