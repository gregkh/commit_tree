KVM: Check for a bad hva before dropping into the ghc slow path

When reading/writing using the guest/host cache, check for a bad hva
before checking for a NULL memslot, which triggers the slow path for
handing cross-page accesses.  Because the memslot is nullified on error
by __kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init(), if the bad hva is encountered after
crossing into a new page, then the kvm_{read,write}_guest() slow path
could potentially write/access the first chunk prior to detecting the
bad hva.

Arguably, performing a partial access is semantically correct from an
architectural perspective, but that behavior is certainly not intended.
In the original implementation, memslot was not explicitly nullified
and therefore the partial access behavior varied based on whether the
memslot itself was null, or if the hva was simply bad.  The current
behavior was introduced as a seemingly unintentional side effect in
commit f1b9dd5eb86c ("kvm: Disallow wraparound in
kvm_gfn_to_hva_cache_init"), which justified the change with "since some
callers don't check the return code from this function, it sit seems
prudent to clear ghc->memslot in the event of an error".

Regardless of intent, the partial access is dependent on _not_ checking
the result of the cache initialization, which is arguably a bug in its
own right, at best simply weird.
