iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Return -EBUSY when trying to re-add a device

Although we WARN in arm_smmu_add_device() if the device being added has
been added already without a subsequent call to arm_smmu_remove_device(),
we still continue half-heartedly, initialising the stream-table for any
new StreamIDs that may have magically appeared and re-establishing device
links that should still be there from last time.

Given that calling ->add_device() twice without removing the device in the
meantime is indicative of an error in the caller, just return -EBUSY after
warning.
