powerpc/mm: Fix missing KUAP disable in flush_coherent_icache()

Stefan reported a strange kernel fault which turned out to be due to a
missing KUAP disable in flush_coherent_icache() called from
flush_icache_range().

The fault looks like:

  Kernel attempted to access user page (7fffc30d9c00) - exploit attempt? (uid: 1009)
  BUG: Unable to handle kernel data access on read at 0x7fffc30d9c00

This path through handle_rt_signal64() to setup_trampoline() and
flush_icache_range() is only triggered by 64-bit processes that have
unmapped their VDSO, which is rare.

flush_icache_range() takes a range of addresses to flush. In
flush_coherent_icache() we implement an optimisation for CPUs where we
know we don't actually have to flush the whole range, we just need to
do a single icbi.

However we still execute the icbi on the user address of the start of
the range we're flushing. On CPUs that also implement KUAP (Power9)
that leads to the spurious fault above.

We should be able to pass any address, including a kernel address, to
the icbi on these CPUs, which would avoid any interaction with KUAP.
But I don't want to make that change in a bug fix, just in case it
surfaces some strange behaviour on some CPU.

So for now just disable KUAP around the icbi. Note the icbi is treated
as a load, so we allow read access, not write as you'd expect.
