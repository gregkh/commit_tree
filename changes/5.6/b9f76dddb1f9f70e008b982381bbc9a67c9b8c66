crypto: skcipher - pass instance to crypto_grab_skcipher()

Initializing a crypto_skcipher_spawn currently requires:

1. Set spawn->base.inst to point to the instance.
2. Call crypto_grab_skcipher().

But there's no reason for these steps to be separate, and in fact this
unneeded complication has caused at least one bug, the one fixed by
commit 6db43410179b ("crypto: adiantum - initialize crypto_spawn::inst")

So just make crypto_grab_skcipher() take the instance as an argument.

To keep the function calls from getting too unwieldy due to this extra
argument, also introduce a 'mask' variable into the affected places
which weren't already using one.
