bootconfig: init: Allow admin to use bootconfig for kernel command line

Since the current kernel command line is too short to describe
many options which supported by kernel, allow user to use boot
config to setup (add) the command line options.

All kernel parameters under "kernel." keywords will be used
for setting up extra kernel command line.

For example,

kernel {
	audit = on
	audit_backlog_limit = 256
}

Note that you can not specify some early parameters
(like console etc.) by this method, since it is
loaded after early parameters parsed.
