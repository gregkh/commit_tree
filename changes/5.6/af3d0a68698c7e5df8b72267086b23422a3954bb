powerpc/kasan: Fix shadow memory protection with CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC

With CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC, new page tables are created at the time
shadow memory for vmalloc area is unmapped. If some parts of the
page table still have entries to the zero page shadow memory, the
entries are wrongly marked RW.

With CONFIG_KASAN_VMALLOC, almost the entire kernel address space
is managed by KASAN. To make it simple, just create KASAN page tables
for the entire kernel space at kasan_init(). That doesn't use much
more space, and that's anyway already done for hash platforms.
