virtio-blk: improve virtqueue error to BLK_STS

Let's change the mapping between virtqueue_add errors to BLK_STS
statuses, so that -ENOSPC, which indicates virtqueue full is still
mapped to BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE, but -ENOMEM which indicates non-device
specific resource outage is mapped to BLK_STS_RESOURCE.
