drm/sun4i: backend: Make sure we enforce the clock rate

The backend needs to run at 300MHz to be functional. This was done so far
using assigned-clocks in the device tree, but that is easy to forget, and
doesn't provide any other guarantee than the rate is going to be roughly
the one requested at probe time.

Therefore it's pretty fragile, so let's just use the exclusive clock API to
enforce it.
