ubifs: allow both hash and disk name to be provided in no-key names

In order to support a new dirhash method that is a secret-keyed hash
over the plaintext filenames (which will be used by encrypted+casefolded
directories on ext4 and f2fs), fscrypt will be switching to a new no-key
name format that always encodes the dirhash in the name.

UBIFS isn't happy with this because it has assertions that verify that
either the hash or the disk name is provided, not both.

Change it to use the disk name if one is provided, even if a hash is
available too; else use the hash.
