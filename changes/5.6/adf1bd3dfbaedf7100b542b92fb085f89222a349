drm/i915/dsi: use afe_clk() instead of intel_dsi_bitrate()

We'll be expanding afe_clk() to take DSC into account. Switch to using
it where DSC matters. Which is really everywhere that
intel_dsi_bitrate() is currently used in ICL DSI code.

The functional difference is that we round the result closest instead of
down.
