KVM: x86: Remove unused ctxt param from emulator's FPU accessors

Remove an unused struct x86_emulate_ctxt * param from low level helpers
used to access guest FPU state.  The unused param was left behind by
commit 6ab0b9feb82a ("x86,kvm: remove KVM emulator get_fpu / put_fpu").

No functional change intended.
