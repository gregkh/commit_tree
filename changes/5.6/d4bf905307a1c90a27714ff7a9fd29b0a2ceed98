powerpc: Fix CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK

When CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING is selected together with (now default)
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK, kernel enter deadlock during boot.

At the point of checking whether interrupts are enabled or not, the
value of MSR saved on stack is read using the physical address of the
stack. But at this point, when using VMAP stack the DATA MMU
translation has already been re-enabled, leading to deadlock.

Don't use the physical address of the stack when
CONFIG_VMAP_STACK is set.
