staging: wfx: use specialized structs for HIF arguments

Most of the commands that are sent to device should take struct in
argument. In the current code, when this struct is binary compatible
with a __le32, the driver use a __le32. This behavior is error prone.
This patch fixes that and uses the specialized structs instead.
