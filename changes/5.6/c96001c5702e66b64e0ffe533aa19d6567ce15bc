KVM: X86: Use APIC_DEST_* macros properly in kvm_lapic_irq.dest_mode

We were using either APIC_DEST_PHYSICAL|APIC_DEST_LOGICAL or 0|1 to
fill in kvm_lapic_irq.dest_mode.  It's fine only because in most cases
when we check against dest_mode it's against APIC_DEST_PHYSICAL (which
equals to 0).  However, that's not consistent.  We'll have problem
when we want to start checking against APIC_DEST_LOGICAL, which does
not equals to 1.

This patch firstly introduces kvm_lapic_irq_dest_mode() helper to take
any boolean of destination mode and return the APIC_DEST_* macro.
Then, it replaces the 0|1 settings of irq.dest_mode with the helper.
