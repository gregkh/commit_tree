MIPS: Add MAC2008 Support

MAC2008 means the processor implemented IEEE754 style Fused MADD
instruction. It was introduced in Release3 but removed in Release5.

The toolchain support of MAC2008 have never landed except for Loongson
processors.

This patch aimed to disabled the MAC2008 if it's optional. For
MAC2008 only processors, we corrected math-emu behavior to align
with actual hardware behavior.
