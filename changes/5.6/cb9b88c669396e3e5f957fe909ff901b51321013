KVM: x86/mmu: Refactor handling of cache consistency with TDP

Pre-calculate the max level for a TDP page with respect to MTRR cache
consistency in preparation of replacing force_pt_level with max_level,
and eventually combining the bulk of nonpaging_page_fault() and
tdp_page_fault() into a common helper.

No functional change intended.
