USB: serial: ir-usb: fix link-speed handling

Commit e0d795e4f36c ("usb: irda: cleanup on ir-usb module") added a USB
IrDA header with common defines, but mistakingly switched to using the
class-descriptor baud-rate bitmask values for the outbound header.

This broke link-speed handling for rates above 9600 baud, but a device
would also be able to operate at the default 9600 baud until a
link-speed request was issued (e.g. using the TCGETS ioctl).
