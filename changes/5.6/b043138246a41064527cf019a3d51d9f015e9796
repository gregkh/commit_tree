x86/KVM: Make sure KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB flag is not missed

There is a potential race in record_steal_time() between setting
host-local vcpu->arch.st.steal.preempted to zero (i.e. clearing
KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED) and propagating this value to the guest with
kvm_write_guest_cached(). Between those two events the guest may
still see KVM_VCPU_PREEMPTED in its copy of kvm_steal_time, set
KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB and assume that hypervisor will do the right
thing. Which it won't.

Instad of copying, we should map kvm_steal_time and that will
guarantee atomicity of accesses to @preempted.

This is part of CVE-2019-3016.
