media: pulse8-cec: INIT_DELAYED_WORK was called too late

If earlier in the connect() an error occurred, then pulse8_cec_adap_free
was called by cec_delete_adapter, and that free function tried to
cancel the ping_eeprom_work workqueue, but that workqueue hasn't
been initialized yet, resulting in a kernel warning.

Move the initialization of that workqueue up to where the other
workqueues are initialized.
