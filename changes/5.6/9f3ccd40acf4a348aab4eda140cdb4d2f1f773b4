drm/i915: Drop GEM context as a direct link from i915_request

Keep the intel_context as being the primary state for i915_request, with
the GEM context a backpointer from the low level state for the rarer
cases we need client information. Our goal is to remove such references
to clients from the backend, and leave the HW submission agnostic to
client interfaces and self-contained.
