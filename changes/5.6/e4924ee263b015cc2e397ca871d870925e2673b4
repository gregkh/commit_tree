firmware: google: Probe for a GSMI handler in firmware

Currently this driver is loaded if the DMI string matches coreboot
and has a proper smi_command in the ACPI FADT table, but a GSMI handler in
SMM is an optional feature in coreboot.

So probe for a SMM GSMI handler before initializing the driver.
If the smihandler leaves the calling argument in %eax in the SMM save state
untouched that generally means the is no handler for GSMI.
