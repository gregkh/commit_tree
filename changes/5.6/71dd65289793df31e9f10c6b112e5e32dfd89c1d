tools arch x86: Sync asm/cpufeatures.h with the kernel sources

To pick up the changes from:

  85c17291e2eb ("x86/cpufeatures: Add flag to track whether MSR IA32_FEAT_CTL is configured")
  f444a5ff95dc ("x86/cpufeatures: Add support for fast short REP; MOVSB")

These don't cause any changes in tooling, just silences this perf build
