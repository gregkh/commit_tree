ARM: dts: exynos: Move Exynos5420 bus related OPPs to the Odroid boards DTS

Currently the only Exynos5422-based boards that support bus frequency
scaling are Hardkernel's Odroid XU3/XU4/HC1. Move the bus related OPPs
to the boards DTS, because those OPPs heavily depend on the clock
topology and top PLL rates, which are being configured by the board's
bootloader.
