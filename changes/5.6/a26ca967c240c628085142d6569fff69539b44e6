drm/vmwgfx: Replace deprecated PTR_RET

Commit 508108ea2747 ("drm/vmwgfx: Don't refcount command-buffer managed
resource lookups during command buffer validation") slips in use of
deprecated PTR_RET. Use PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO instead.

As the PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO is a bit longer than PTR_RET, we introduce
local variable ret for proper indentation and line-length limits.
