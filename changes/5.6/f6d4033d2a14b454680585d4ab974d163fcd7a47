iio: buffer: rename 'read_first_n' callback to 'read'

It is implied that 'read' will read the first n bytes and not e.g. bytes
only from offsets within the buffer that are a prime number.

This change is non-functional, mostly just a rename.
A secondary intent with this patch is to make room later to add a write
callback.
