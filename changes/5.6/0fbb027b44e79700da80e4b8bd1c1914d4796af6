ALSA: pcm: Fix double hw_free calls

The commit 66f2d19f8116 ("ALSA: pcm: Fix memory leak at closing a
stream without hw_free") tried to fix the regression wrt the missing
hw_free call at closing without SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_HW_FREE ioctl.
However, the code change dropped mistakenly the state check, resulting
in calling hw_free twice when SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_HW_FRE got called
beforehand.  For most drivers, this is almost harmless, but the
drivers like SOF show another regression now.

This patch adds the state condition check before calling do_hw_free()
at releasing the stream for avoiding the double hw_free calls.
