tcp: Add l3index to tcp_md5sig_key and md5 functions

Add l3index to tcp_md5sig_key to represent the L3 domain of a key, and
add l3index to tcp_md5_do_add and tcp_md5_do_del to fill in the key.

With the key now based on an l3index, add the new parameter to the
lookup functions and consider the l3index when looking for a match.

The l3index comes from the skb when processing ingress packets leveraging
the helpers created for socket lookups, tcp_v4_sdif and inet_iif (and the
v6 variants). When the sdif index is set it means the packet ingressed a
device that is part of an L3 domain and inet_iif points to the VRF device.
For egress, the L3 domain is determined from the socket binding and
sk_bound_dev_if.
