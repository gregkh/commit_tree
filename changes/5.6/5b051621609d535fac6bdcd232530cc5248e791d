mlxsw: Add irif and erif disabled traps

IRIF_DISABLED and ERIF_DISABLED are driver specific traps. Packets are
dropped for these reasons when they need to be routed through/from
existing router interfaces (RIF) which are disabled.

Add devlink driver-specific traps and mlxsw trap IDs used to report
these traps.
