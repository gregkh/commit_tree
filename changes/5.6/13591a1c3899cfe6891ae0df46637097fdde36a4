ath11k: register HE mesh capabilities

The capabilities for the HE mesh are generated from the capabilities
reported by the fw. But the firmware only reports the overall capabilities
and not the one which are specific for mesh. Some of them (TWT, MU UL/DL,
TB PPDU, ...) require an infrastructure setup with a main STA (AP)
controlling the operations. This is not the case for mesh and thus these
capabilities are removed from the list of capabilities.
