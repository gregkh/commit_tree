ipv6: Handle route deletion notification

For the purpose of route offload, when a single route is deleted, it is
only of interest if it is the first route in the node or if it is
sibling to such a route.

In the first case, distinguish between several possibilities:

1. Route is the last route in the node. Emit a delete notification

2. Route is followed by a non-multipath route. Emit a replace
notification for the non-multipath route.

3. Route is followed by a multipath route. Emit a replace notification
for the multipath route.

In the second case, only emit a delete notification to ensure the route
is no longer used as a valid nexthop.
