xdp: Simplify cpumap cleanup

After the RCU flavor consolidation [1], call_rcu() and
synchronize_rcu() waits for preempt-disable regions (NAPI) in addition
to the read-side critical sections. As a result of this, the cleanup
code in cpumap can be simplified

* There is no longer a need to flush in __cpu_map_entry_free, since we
  know that this has been done when the call_rcu() callback is
  triggered.

* When freeing the map, there is no need to explicitly wait for a
  flush. It's guaranteed to be done after the synchronize_rcu() call
  in cpu_map_free().
