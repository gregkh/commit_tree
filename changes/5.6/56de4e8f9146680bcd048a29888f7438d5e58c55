perf: Make struct ring_buffer less ambiguous

eBPF requires needing to know the size of the perf ring buffer structure.
But it unfortunately has the same name as the generic ring buffer used by
tracing and oprofile. To make it less ambiguous, rename the perf ring buffer
structure to "perf_buffer".

As other parts of the ring buffer code has "perf_" as the prefix, it only
makes sense to give the ring buffer the "perf_" prefix as well.
