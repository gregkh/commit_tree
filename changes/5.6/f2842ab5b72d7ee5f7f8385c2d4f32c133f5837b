io_uring: enable option to only trigger eventfd for async completions

If an application is using eventfd notifications with poll to know when
new SQEs can be issued, it's expecting the following read/writes to
complete inline. And with that, it knows that there are events available,
and don't want spurious wakeups on the eventfd for those requests.

This adds IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD_ASYNC, which works just like
IORING_REGISTER_EVENTFD, except it only triggers notifications for events
that happen from async completions (IRQ, or io-wq worker completions).
Any completions inline from the submission itself will not trigger
notifications.
