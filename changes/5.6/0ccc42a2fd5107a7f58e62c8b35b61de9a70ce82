drm/i915: Preload LUTs if the hw isn't currently using them

The LUTs are single buffered so in order to program them without
tearing we'd have to do it during vblank (actually to be 100%
effective it has to happen between start of vblank and frame start).
We have no proper mechanism for that at the moment so we just
defer loading them after the vblank waits have happened. That
is not quite sufficient (especially when committing multiple pipes
whose vblanks don't line up) so the LUT load will often leak into
the following frame causing tearing.

However in case the hardware wasn't previously using the LUT we
can preload it before setting the enable bit (which is double
buffered so won't tear). Let's determine if we can do such
preloading and make it happen. Slight variation between the
hardware requires some platforms specifics in the checks.

Hans is seeing ugly colored flash on VLV/CHV macchines (GPD win
and Asus T100HA) when the gamma LUT gets loaded for the first
time as the BIOS has left some junk in the LUT memory.
