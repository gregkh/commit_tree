staging: wfx: fix the cache of rate policies on interface reset

Device and driver maintain a cache of rate policies (aka.
tx_retry_policy in hardware API).

When hif_reset() is sent to hardware, device resets its cache of rate
policies. In order to keep driver in sync, it is necessary to do the
same on driver.

Note, when driver tries to use a rate policy that has not been defined
on device, data is sent at 1Mbps. So, this patch should fix abnormal
throughput observed sometime after a reset of the interface.
