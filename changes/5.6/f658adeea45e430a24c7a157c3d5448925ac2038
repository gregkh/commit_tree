fix up iter on short count in fuse_direct_io()

fuse_direct_io() can end up advancing the iterator by more than the amount
of data read or written.  This case is handled by the generic code if going
through ->direct_IO(), but not in the FOPEN_DIRECT_IO case.

Fix by reverting the extra bytes from the iterator in case of error or a
short count.

To test: install lxcfs, then the following testcase
  int fd = open("/var/lib/lxcfs/proc/uptime", O_RDONLY);
  sendfile(1, fd, NULL, 16777216);
  sendfile(1, fd, NULL, 16777216);
will spew WARN_ON() in iov_iter_pipe().
