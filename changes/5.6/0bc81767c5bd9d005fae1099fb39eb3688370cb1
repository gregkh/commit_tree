crypto: arm/chacha - fix build failured when kernel mode NEON is disabled

When the ARM accelerated ChaCha driver is built as part of a configuration
that has kernel mode NEON disabled, we expect the compiler to propagate
the build time constant expression IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_KERNEL_MODE_NEON) in
a way that eliminates all the cross-object references to the actual NEON
routines, which allows the chacha-neon-core.o object to be omitted from
the build entirely.

Unfortunately, this fails to work as expected in some cases, and we may
end up with a build error such as

  chacha-glue.c:(.text+0xc0): undefined reference to `chacha_4block_xor_neon'

caused by the fact that chacha_doneon() has not been eliminated from the
object code, even though it will never be called in practice.

Let's fix this by adding some IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_KERNEL_MODE_NEON) tests
that are not strictly needed from a logical point of view, but should
help the compiler infer that the NEON code paths are unreachable in
those cases.
