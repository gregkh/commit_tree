tools include UAPI: Sync x86's syscalls_64.tbl, generic unistd.h and fcntl.h to pick up openat2 and pidfd_getfd

  fddb5d430ad9 ("open: introduce openat2(2) syscall")
  9a2cef09c801 ("arch: wire up pidfd_getfd syscall")

We also need to grab a copy of uapi/linux/openat2.h since it is now
needed by fcntl.h, add it to tools/perf/check_headers.h.

Update tools/'s copy of that file:

  $ cp arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl

See the result:

Now one can use:

  perf trace -e openat2,pidfd_getfd

To get just those syscalls or use in things like:

  perf trace -e open*

To get all the open variant (open, openat, openat2, etc) or:

  perf trace pidfd*

To get the pidfd syscalls.
