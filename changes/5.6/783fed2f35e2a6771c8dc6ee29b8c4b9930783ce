perf intel-bts: Fix endless record after being terminated

In __cmd_record(), when receiving SIGINT(ctrl + c), a 'done' flag will
be set and the event list will be disabled by evlist__disable() once.

While in auxtrace_record.read_finish(), the related events will be
enabled again, if they are continuous, the recording seems to be
endless.

If the intel_bts event is disabled, we don't enable it again here.

Note: This patch is NOT tested since i don't have such a machine with
intel_bts feature, but the code seems buggy same as arm-spe and
intel-pt.
