hwmon: (k10temp) Don't show temperature limits on Ryzen (Zen) CPUs

The maximum Tdie or Tctl is not published for Ryzen CPUs. What is
known, however, is that the traditional value of 70 degrees C is no
longer correct. On top of that, the limit applies to Tctl, not to Tdie.
Displaying it in either context is meaningless, confusing, and wrong.
Stop doing it.
