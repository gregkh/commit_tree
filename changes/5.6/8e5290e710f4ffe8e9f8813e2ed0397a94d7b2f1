bpf: Return better error value in delete_elem for struct_ops map

The current always succeed behavior in bpf_struct_ops_map_delete_elem()
is not ideal for userspace tool.  It can be improved to return proper
error value.

If it is in TOBEFREE, it means unregistration has been already done
before but it is in progress and waiting for the subsystem to clear
the refcnt to zero, so -EINPROGRESS.

If it is INIT, it means the struct_ops has not been registered yet,
so -ENOENT.
