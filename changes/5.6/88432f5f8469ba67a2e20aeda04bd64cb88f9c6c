arm64: dts: allwinner: h6: Add PWM node

Allwinner H6 PWM is similar to that in A20 except that it has additional
bus clock and reset line.

Note that first PWM channel is connected to output pin and second
channel is used internally, as a clock source to AC200 co-packaged chip.
This means that any combination of these two channels can be used and
thus it doesn't make sense to add pinctrl nodes at this point.
