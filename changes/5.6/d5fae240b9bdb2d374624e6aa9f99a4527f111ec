m68k: configs: Cleanup old Kconfig IO scheduler options

CONFIG_IOSCHED_DEADLINE and CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ are gone since
commit f382fb0bcef4 ("block: remove legacy IO schedulers").

The IOSCHED_DEADLINE was replaced by MQ_IOSCHED_DEADLINE and it will be
now enabled by default (along with MQ_IOSCHED_KYBER).
