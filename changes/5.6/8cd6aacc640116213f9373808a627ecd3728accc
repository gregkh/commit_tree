powerpc/pcidn: Make VF pci_dn management CONFIG_PCI_IOV specific

The powerpc PCI code requires that a pci_dn structure exists for all
devices in the system. This is fine for real devices since at boot a pci_dn
is created for each PCI device in the DT and it's fine for hotplugged devices
since the hotplug slot driver will manage the pci_dn's devices in hotplug
slots. For SR-IOV, we need the platform / pcibios to manage the pci_dn for
virtual functions since firmware is unaware of VFs, and they aren't
"hot plugged" in the traditional sense.

Management of the pci_dn is handled by the, poorly named, functions:
add_pci_dev_data() and remove_pci_dev_data(). The entire body of these
functions is #ifdef`ed around CONFIG_PCI_IOV and they cannot be used
in any other context, so make them only available when CONFIG_PCI_IOV
is selected, and rename them to reflect their actual usage rather than
having them masquerade as generic code.
