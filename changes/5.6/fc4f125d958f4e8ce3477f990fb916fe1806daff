drm/i915/gem: Embed context/timeline name inside the GEM context

Use a small char buffer inside the i915_gem_context to store the user
friendly name so that ctx->name has the same lifetime as the RCU
protected GEM context. That is, e.g. when using print_request() that
prints the timeline name (ctx->name), the name will not be prematurely
freed upon the context being closed and the last reference dropped.
