hugetlb_cgroup: fix illegal access to memory

This appears to be a mistake in commit faced7e0806cf ("mm: hugetlb
controller for cgroups v2").

Essentially that commit does a hugetlb_cgroup_from_counter assuming that
page_counter_try_charge has initialized counter.

But if that has failed then it seems will not initialize counter, so
hugetlb_cgroup_from_counter(counter) ends up pointing to random memory,
causing kasan to complain.

The solution is to simply use 'h_cg', instead of
hugetlb_cgroup_from_counter(counter), since that is a reference to the
hugetlb_cgroup anyway.  After this change kasan ceases to complain.
