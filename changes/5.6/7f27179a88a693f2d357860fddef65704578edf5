KVM: SVM: Use direct vcpu pointer during vCPU create/free

Capture the vcpu pointer in a local varaible and replace '&svm->vcpu'
references with a direct reference to the pointer in anticipation of
moving bits of the code to common x86 and passing the vcpu pointer into
svm_create_vcpu(), i.e. eliminate unnecessary noise from future patches.
