MAINTAINERS: Correct Cadence PCI driver path

de80f95ccb9c ("PCI: cadence: Move all files to per-device cadence
directory") moved files of the PCI cadence drivers, but did not update the
MAINTAINERS entry.

Since then, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test complains:

  warning: no file matches F: drivers/pci/controller/pcie-cadence*

Repair the MAINTAINERS entry.
