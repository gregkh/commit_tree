gfs2: fix gfs2_find_jhead that returns uninitialized jhead with seq 0

When the first log header in a journal happens to have a sequence
number of 0, a bug in gfs2_find_jhead() causes it to prematurely exit,
and return an uninitialized jhead with seq 0. This can cause failures
in the caller. For instance, a mount fails in one test case.

The correct behavior is for it to continue searching through the journal
to find the correct journal head with the highest sequence number.
