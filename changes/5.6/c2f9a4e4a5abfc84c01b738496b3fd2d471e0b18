iwlegacy: ensure loop counter addr does not wrap and cause an infinite loop

The loop counter addr is a u16 where as the upper limit of the loop
is an int. In the unlikely event that the il->cfg->eeprom_size is
greater than 64K then we end up with an infinite loop since addr will
wrap around an never reach upper loop limit. Fix this by making addr
an int.
