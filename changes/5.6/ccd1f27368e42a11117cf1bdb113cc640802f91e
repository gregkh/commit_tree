Revert "MAINTAINERS: mptcp@ mailing list is moderated"

This reverts commit 74759e1693311a8d1441de836c4080c192374238.

mptcp@lists.01.org accepts messages from non-subscribers. There was an
invisible and unexpected server-wide rule limiting the number of
recipients for subscribers and non-subscribers alike, and that has now
been turned off for this list.
