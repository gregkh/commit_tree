btrfs: decrement number of open devices after closing the device not before

In btrfs_close_one_device we're decrementing the number of open devices
before we're calling btrfs_close_bdev().

As there is no intermediate exit between these points in this function it
is technically OK to do so, but it makes the code a bit harder to understand.

Move both operations closer together and move the decrement step after
btrfs_close_bdev().
