arm64: defconfig: Enable Qualcomm socinfo driver

The Qualcomm socinfo driver provides SoC information to userspace using
the standard soc interface as well as a number of debugfs entries.

Enable this to allow certain user space tools to acquire this
information, as well as getting developers access to the information in
debugfs that is useful when reporting bugs.
