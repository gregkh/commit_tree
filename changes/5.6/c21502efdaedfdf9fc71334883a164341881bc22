Documentation: admin-guide: PM: Update sleep states documentation

There is some information in Documentation/power/interface.rst that
is still missing from Documentation/admin-guide/pm/sleep-states.rst
and really should be present in there, so update the latter by
adding that information to it and delete the former (as it becomes
redundant after that and it is somewhat outdated).

While at it, clean up some assorted pieces of sleep-states.rst a bit.
