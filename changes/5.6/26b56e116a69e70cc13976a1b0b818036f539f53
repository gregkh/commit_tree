include/linux/mm.h: clean up obsolete check on space in page->flags

The check was intended to make sure we don't overrun page flags.  But
it's obsolete because it doesn't include LAST_CPUPID_WIDTH nor
KASAN_TAG_WIDTH.

Just remove check since we already have it covered in
linux/page-flags-layout.h (near the end of the file).
