brcmfmac: sdio: Fix OOB interrupt initialization on brcm43362

Commit 262f2b53f679 ("brcmfmac: call brcmf_attach() just before calling
brcmf_bus_started()") changed the initialization order of the brcmfmac
SDIO driver. Unfortunately since brcmf_sdiod_intr_register() is now
called before the sdiodev->bus_if initialization, it reads the wrong
chip ID and fails to initialize the GPIO on brcm43362. Thus the chip
cannot send interrupts and fails to probe:

[   12.517023] brcmfmac: brcmf_sdio_bus_rxctl: resumed on timeout
[   12.531214] ieee80211 phy0: brcmf_bus_started: failed: -110
[   12.536976] ieee80211 phy0: brcmf_attach: dongle is not responding: err=-110
[   12.566467] brcmfmac: brcmf_sdio_firmware_callback: brcmf_attach failed

Initialize the bus interface earlier to ensure that
brcmf_sdiod_intr_register() properly sets up the OOB interrupt.
