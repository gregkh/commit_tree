net: ena: fix continuous keep-alive resets

last_keep_alive_jiffies is updated in probe and when a keep-alive
event is received.  In case the driver times-out on a keep-alive event,
it has high chances of continuously timing-out on keep-alive events.
This is because when the driver recovers from the keep-alive-timeout reset
the value of last_keep_alive_jiffies is very old, and if a keep-alive
event is not received before the next timer expires, the value of
last_keep_alive_jiffies will cause another keep-alive-timeout reset
and so forth in a loop.

Solution:
Update last_keep_alive_jiffies whenever the device is restored after
reset.
