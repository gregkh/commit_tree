selftests/eeh: Bump EEH wait time to 60s

Some newer cards supported by aacraid can take up to 40s to recover
after an EEH event. This causes spurious failures in the basic EEH
self-test since the current maximim timeout is only 30s.

Fix the immediate issue by bumping the timeout to a default of 60s,
and allow the wait time to be specified via an environmental variable
(EEH_MAX_WAIT).
