intel_idle: Use ACPI _CST on server systems

In many cases, especially on server systems, it is desirable to avoid
enabling C-states that have been disabled in the platform firmware
(BIOS) setup, except for C1E.

As a rule, the C-states disabled this way are not listed by ACPI
_CST, so if that is used by intel_idle along with the specific
table of C-states that it has for the given processor, the C-states
disabled through the platform firmware will not be enabled by default
by intel_idle.

Accordingly, set the use_acpi flag (introduced previously) in all
server processor profiles defined in intel_idle (so as to make it use
ACPI _CST to decide which C-states to enable by default) and set
the CPUIDLE_FLAG_ALWAYS_ENABLE flag (also introduced previously)
for C1E in all C-states tables in intel_idle that contain C1 too
(so that C1E is enabled regardless of whether or not it is listed
by ACPI _CST).
