ASoC: SOF: fix an Oops, caused by invalid topology

It is possible to create invalid topology that will cause a kernel
Oops when trying to allocate buffers for a NULL substream.
Specifically such an Oops was caused by a topology, where a DAI on a
capture pipeline was referencing the PCM ID from a playback pipeline.
Fix the Oops by explicitly checking for NULL.
