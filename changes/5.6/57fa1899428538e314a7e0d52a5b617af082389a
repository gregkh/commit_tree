scripts/sorttable: Implement build-time ORC unwind table sorting

The ORC unwinder has two tables: .orc_unwind_ip and .orc_unwind, which
need to be sorted for binary search. Previously this sorting was done
during bootup.

Sort them at build time to speed up booting.

Add the ORC tables sorting in a parallel build process to speed up the build.

[ mingo: Rewrote the changelog and fixed some comments. ]
