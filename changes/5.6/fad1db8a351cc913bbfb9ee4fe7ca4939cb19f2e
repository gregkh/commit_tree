devtmpfs: initify a bit

devtmpfs_mount() is only called from prepare_namespace() in
init/do_mounts.c, which is an __init function, so devtmpfs_mount() can
also be moved to .init.text.

Then the mount_dev static variable is only referenced from __init
functions (devtmpfs_mount and its initializer function mount_param).
