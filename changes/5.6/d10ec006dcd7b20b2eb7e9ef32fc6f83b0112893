perf hists browser: Allow passing an initial hotkey

Sometimes we're in an outer code, like the main hists browser popup menu
and the user follows a suggestion about using some hotkey, and that
hotkey is really handled by hists_browser__run(), so allow for calling
it with that hotkey, making it handle it instead of waiting for the user
to press one.
