selftests/timens: Add Time Namespace test for supported clocks

A test to check that all supported clocks work on host and inside
a new time namespace. Use both ways to get time: through VDSO and
by entering the kernel with implicit syscall.

Introduce a new timens directory in selftests framework for
the next timens tests.

Output on success:
 1..10
 ok 1 Passed for CLOCK_BOOTTIME (syscall)
 ok 2 Passed for CLOCK_BOOTTIME (vdso)
 ok 3 Passed for CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM (syscall)
 ok 4 Passed for CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM (vdso)
 ok 5 Passed for CLOCK_MONOTONIC (syscall)
 ok 6 Passed for CLOCK_MONOTONIC (vdso)
 ok 7 Passed for CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE (syscall)
 ok 8 Passed for CLOCK_MONOTONIC_COARSE (vdso)
 ok 9 Passed for CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW (syscall)
 ok 10 Passed for CLOCK_MONOTONIC_RAW (vdso)
 # Pass 10 Fail 0 Xfail 0 Xpass 0 Skip 0 Error 0

Output with lack of permissions:
 1..10
 not ok 1 # SKIP need to run as root

Output without support of time namespaces:
 1..10
 not ok 1 # SKIP Time namespaces are not supported
