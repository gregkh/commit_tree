arm64: Drop do_el0_ia_bp_hardening() & do_sp_pc_abort() declarations

There is a redundant do_sp_pc_abort() declaration in exceptions.h which can
be removed. Also do_el0_ia_bp_hardening() as been already been dropped with
the commit bfe298745afc ("arm64: entry-common: don't touch daif before
bp-hardening") and hence does not need a declaration any more. This should
not introduce any functional change.
