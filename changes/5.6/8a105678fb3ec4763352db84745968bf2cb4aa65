xenbus/backend: Add memory pressure handler callback

Granting pages consumes backend system memory.  In systems configured
with insufficient spare memory for those pages, it can cause a memory
pressure situation.  However, finding the optimal amount of the spare
memory is challenging for large systems having dynamic resource
utilization patterns.  Also, such a static configuration might lack
flexibility.

To mitigate such problems, this commit adds a memory reclaim callback to
'xenbus_driver'.  If a memory pressure is detected, 'xenbus' requests
every backend driver to volunarily release its memory.

Note that it would be able to improve the callback facility for more
sophisticated handlings of general pressures.  For example, it would be
possible to monitor the memory consumption of each device and issue the
release requests to only devices which causing the pressure.  Also, the
callback could be extended to handle not only memory, but general
resources.  Nevertheless, this version of the implementation defers such
sophisticated goals as a future work.
