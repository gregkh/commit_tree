crypto: cipher - make crypto_spawn_cipher() take a crypto_cipher_spawn

Now that all users of single-block cipher spawns have been converted to
use 'struct crypto_cipher_spawn' rather than the less specifically typed
'struct crypto_spawn', make crypto_spawn_cipher() take a pointer to a
'struct crypto_cipher_spawn' rather than a 'struct crypto_spawn'.
