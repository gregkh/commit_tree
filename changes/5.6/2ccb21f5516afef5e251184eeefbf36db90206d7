gpiolib: acpi: Rework honor_wakeup option into an ignore_wake option

Commit aa23ca3d98f7 ("gpiolib: acpi: Add honor_wakeup module-option +
quirk mechanism") was added to deal with spurious wakeups on one specific
model of the HP x2 10 series.

The approach taken there was to add a bool controlling wakeup support for
all ACPI GPIO events. This was sufficient for the specific HP x2 10 model
the commit was trying to fix, but in the mean time other models have
turned up which need a similar workaround to avoid spurious wakeups from
suspend, but only for one of the pins on which the ACPI tables request
ACPI GPIO events.

Since the honor_wakeup option was added to be able to ignore wake events,
the name was perhaps not the best, this commit renames it to ignore_wake
and changes it to a string with the following format:
gpiolib_acpi.ignore_wake=controller@pin[,controller@pin[,...]]

This allows working around spurious wakeup issues on a per pin basis.

This commit also reworks the existing quirk for the HP x2 10 so that
it functions as before.

Note:
-This removes the honor_wakeup parameter. This has only been upstream for
 a short time and to the best of my knowledge there are no users using
 this module parameter.

-The controller@pin[,controller@pin[,...]] syntax is based on an existing
 kernel module parameter using the same controller@pin format. That version
 uses ';' as separator, but in practice that is problematic because grub2
 cannot handle this without taking special care to escape the ';', so here
 we are using a ',' as separator instead which does not have this issue.
