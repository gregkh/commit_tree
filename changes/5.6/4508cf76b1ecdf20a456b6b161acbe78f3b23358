serial: cpm_uart: call cpm_muram_init before registering console

Christophe reports that powerpc 8xx silently fails to 5.6-rc1. It turns
out I was wrong about nobody relying on the lazy initialization of the
cpm/qe muram in commit b6231ea2b3c6 (soc: fsl: qe: drop broken lazy
call of cpm_muram_init()).

Rather than reinstating the somewhat dubious lazy call (initializing a
currently held spinlock, and implicitly doing a GFP_KERNEL under that
spinlock), make sure that cpm_muram_init() is called early enough - I
thought the calls from the subsys_initcalls were good enough, but when
used by console drivers, that's obviously not the
case. cpm_muram_init() is safe to call twice (there's an early return
if it is already initialized), so keep the call from cpm_init() - in
case SERIAL_CPM_CONSOLE=n.
