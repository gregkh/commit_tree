irqchip: Add NXP INTMUX interrupt multiplexer support

The Interrupt Multiplexer (INTMUX) expands the number of peripherals
that can interrupt the core:
* The INTMUX has 8 channels that are assigned to 8 NVIC interrupt slots.
* Each INTMUX channel can receive up to 32 interrupt sources and has 1
  interrupt output.
* The INTMUX routes the interrupt sources to the interrupt outputs.
