ipv6: Fix route replacement with dev-only route

After commit 27596472473a ("ipv6: fix ECMP route replacement") it is no
longer possible to replace an ECMP-able route by a non ECMP-able route.
For example,
	ip route add 2001:db8::1/128 via fe80::1 dev dummy0
	ip route replace 2001:db8::1/128 dev dummy0
does not work as expected.

Tweak the replacement logic so that point 3 in the log of the above commit
becomes:
3. If the new route is not ECMP-able, and no matching non-ECMP-able route
exists, replace matching ECMP-able route (if any) or add the new route.

We can now summarize the entire replace semantics to:
When doing a replace, prefer replacing a matching route of the same
"ECMP-able-ness" as the replace argument. If there is no such candidate,
fallback to the first route found.
