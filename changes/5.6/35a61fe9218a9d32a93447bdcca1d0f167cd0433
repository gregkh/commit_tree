drm: Stop accessing encoder->bridge directly

We are about to replace the single-linked bridge list by a double-linked
one based on list.h, leading to the suppression of the encoder->bridge
field. But before we can do that we must provide a
drm_bridge_chain_get_first_bridge() bridge helper and patch all drivers
and core helpers to use it instead of directly accessing encoder->bridge.

Note that we still have 2 drivers (VC4 and Exynos) manipulating the
encoder->bridge field directly because they need to cut the bridge chain
in order to control the enable/disable sequence. This is definitely
not something we want to encourage, so let's keep those 2 oddities
around until we find a better solution.
