ARM: dts: exynos: Remove syscon compatible from chipid node on Exynos5

The "syscon" compatible string was introduced in commit ("cdcce1ee977b
ARM: dts: exynos: Add "syscon" compatible string to chipid node on Exynos5")
to allow sharing of the CHIPID IO region between multiple drivers.
However, such sharing can be also done without an additional compatible
so remove the syscon entry.
