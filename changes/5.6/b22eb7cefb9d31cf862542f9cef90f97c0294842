torture: Hoist calls to lscpu to higher-level kvm.sh script

On some kernels, concurrent calls to the lscpu command result in severe
slowdowns.  For example, on v4.16, a single lscpu invocation takes about
two milliseconds, four concurrent invocations more than two seconds,
and 16 concurrent invocations more than 20 seconds.  Given that the only
goal is to learn the number of CPUs, invoking lscpu but once suffices.
This commit therefore invokes lscpu early in kvm.sh execution, setting
the initial value of the TORTURE_ALLOTED_CPUS environment variable.
