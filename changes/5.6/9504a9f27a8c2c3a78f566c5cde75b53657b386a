arm64: dts: renesas: Group tuples in pci ranges and dma-ranges properties

To improve human readability and enable automatic validation, the tuples
in the "ranges" and "dma-ranges" properties of PCI device nodes should
be grouped.

Fix this by grouping the tuples of the "ranges" and "dma-ranges"
properties using angle brackets.
