ARM: dts: sh73a0: Add missing clock-frequency for fixed clocks

"clock-frequency" is a required property for devices nodes compatible
with "fixed-clock", leading to warnings when running

    $ make dtbs_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/fixed-clock.yaml
    arch/arm/boot/dts/sh73a0-kzm9g.dt.yaml: extcki: 'clock-frequency' is a required property

Fix this by adding the missing "clock-frequency" properties to the various
clocks, to be overridden by the board DTS files when populated.
