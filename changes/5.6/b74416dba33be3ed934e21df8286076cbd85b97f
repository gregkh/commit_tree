irqchip: Define EXYNOS_IRQ_COMBINER

This patch is written to clean up dependency of ARCH_EXYNOS
Not all exynos device have IRQ_COMBINER, especially aarch64 EXYNOS
but it is built for all exynos devices.
Thus add the config for EXYNOS_IRQ_COMBINER
remove direct dependency between ARCH_EXYNOS and exynos-combiner.c
and only selected on the aarch32 devices
