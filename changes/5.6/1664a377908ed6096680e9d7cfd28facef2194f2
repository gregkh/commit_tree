kbuild: pass KBUILD_MODFILE when compiling builtin objects

When compiling, Kbuild passes KBUILD_BASENAME (basename of the object)
and KBUILD_MODNAME (basename of the module).

This commit adds another one, KBUILD_MODFILE, which is the path of
the module. (or, the path of the module it would end up in if it were
compiled as a module.)

The next commit will use this to generate modules.builtin without
tristate.conf.
