bpf, xdp: virtio_net use access ptr macro for xdp enable check

virtio_net currently relies on rcu critical section to access the xdp
program in its xdp_xmit handler. However, the pointer to the xdp program
is only used to do a NULL pointer comparison to determine if xdp is
enabled or not.

Use rcu_access_pointer() instead of rcu_dereference() to reflect this.
Then later when we drop rcu_read critical section virtio_net will not
need in special handling.
