ACPI: processor: Export function to claim _CST control

The intel_idle driver will be modified to use ACPI _CST subsequently
and it will need to notify the platform firmware of that if
acpi_gbl_FADT.cst_control is set, so add a routine for this purpose,
acpi_processor_claim_cst_control(), to acpi_processor.c (so that it
is always present which is required by intel_idle) and export it
to allow the ACPI processor driver (which is modular) to call it.

No intentional functional impact.
