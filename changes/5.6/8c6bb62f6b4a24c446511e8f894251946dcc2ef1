dmaengine: ti: k3 PSI-L remote endpoint configuration

In K3 architecture the DMA operates within threads. One end of the thread
is UDMAP, the other is on the peripheral side.

The UDMAP channel configuration depends on the needs of the remote
endpoint and it can be differ from peripheral to peripheral.

This patch adds database for am654 and j721e and small API to fetch the
PSI-L endpoint configuration from the database which should only used by
the DMA driver(s).

Another API is added for native peripherals to give possibility to pass new
configuration for the threads they are using, which is needed to be able to
handle changes caused by different firmware loaded for the peripheral for
example.
