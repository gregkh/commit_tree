drm/etnaviv: reject timeouts with tv_nsec >= NSEC_PER_SEC

Most kernel interfaces that take a timespec require normalized
representation with tv_nsec between 0 and NSEC_PER_SEC.

Passing values larger than 0x100000000ull further behaves differently
on 32-bit and 64-bit kernels, and can cause the latter to spend a long
time counting seconds in timespec64_sub()/set_normalized_timespec64().

Reject those large values at the user interface to enforce sane and
portable behavior.
