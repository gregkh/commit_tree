MIPS: Disable VDSO time functionality on microMIPS

A check we're about to add to pick up on function calls that depend on
bogus use of the GOT in the VDSO picked up on instances of such function
calls in microMIPS builds. Since the code appears genuinely problematic,
and given the relatively small amount of use & testing that microMIPS
sees, go ahead & disable the VDSO for microMIPS builds.
