ext4: only use fscrypt_zeroout_range() on regular files

fscrypt_zeroout_range() is only for encrypted regular files, not for
encrypted directories or symlinks.

Fortunately, currently it seems it's never called on non-regular files.
But to be safe ext4 should explicitly check S_ISREG() before calling it.
