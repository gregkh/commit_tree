drm/i915/gt: Always force restore freshly pinned contexts

It is highly unlikely, but still conceivable, that we submit a context
with the same GGTT address as last active on the HW. In this case, with
a matching LRCA, the HW would not restore the new context image causing
a potential violation of our context isolation.
