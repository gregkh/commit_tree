scripts/find-unused-docs: Fix massive false positives

scripts/find-unused-docs.sh invokes scripts/kernel-doc to find out if a
source file contains kerneldoc or not.

However, as it passes the no longer supported "-text" option to
scripts/kernel-doc, the latter prints out its help text, causing all
files to be considered containing kerneldoc.

Get rid of these false positives by removing the no longer supported
"-text" option from the scripts/kernel-doc invocation.
