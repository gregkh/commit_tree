drm/amd/display: Change the delay time before enabling FEC

[why]
DP spec requires 1000 symbols delay between the end of link training
and enabling FEC in the stream. Currently we are using 1 miliseconds
delay which is not accurate.

[how]
One lane RBR should have the maximum time for transmitting 1000 LL
codes which is 6.173 us. So using 7 microseconds delay instead of
1 miliseconds.
