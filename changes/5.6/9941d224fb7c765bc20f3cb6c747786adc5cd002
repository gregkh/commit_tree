KVM: Move putting of vcpu->pid to kvm_vcpu_destroy()

Move the putting of vcpu->pid to kvm_vcpu_destroy().  vcpu->pid is
guaranteed to be NULL when kvm_vcpu_uninit() is called in the error path
of kvm_vm_ioctl_create_vcpu(), e.g. it is explicitly nullified by
kvm_vcpu_init() and is only changed by KVM_RUN.

No functional change intended.
