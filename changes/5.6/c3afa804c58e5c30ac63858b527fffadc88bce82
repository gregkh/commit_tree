gpio: xilinx: Fix bug where the wrong GPIO register is written to

Care is taken with "index", however with the current version
the actual xgpio_writereg is using index for data but
xgpio_regoffset(chip, i) for the offset. And since i is already
incremented it is incorrect. This patch fixes it so that index
is used for the offset too.
