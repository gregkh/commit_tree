net: sfp: add more extended compliance codes

SFF-8024 is used to define various constants re-used in several SFF
SFP-related specifications.  Split these constants from the enum, and
rename them to indicate that they're defined by SFF-8024.

Add and use updated SFF-8024 extended compliance code definitions for
10GBASE-T, 5GBASE-T and 2.5GBASE-T modules.
