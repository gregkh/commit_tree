dt-bindings: fix warnings in validation of qcom,gcc.yaml

The last example in qcom,gcc.yaml set 'sleep' as the second
value of 'clock-names'. According to the schema is should
be 'sleep_clk'. Fix the example to conform the schema.
This fixes a warning when validating the schema:
"clock-names:  ... is not valid under any of the given schemas"
