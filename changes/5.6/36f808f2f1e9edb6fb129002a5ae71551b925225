ARM: dts: motorola-cpcap-mapphone: Configure calibration interrupt

We added coulomb counter calibration support With commit 0cb90f071f73
("power: supply: cpcap-battery: Add basic coulomb counter calibrate
support"), but we also need to configure the related interrupt.

Without the interrupt calibration happens based on a timeout after two
seconds, with the interrupt the calibration just gets done a bit faster.
