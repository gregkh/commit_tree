drm/ast: Add primary plane

Like the original mode-setting code, the primary plane supports XRGB888,
RGB565 and C8. The plane itself only pins BOs and sets the base address
and scanline offset. The mode-setting code will be located in the CRTC's
atomic helpers.

v2:
	* don't set plane call-back functions to NULL explicitly
	* define plane format array in global scope
