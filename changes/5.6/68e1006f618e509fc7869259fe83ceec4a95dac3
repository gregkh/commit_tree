net: hns3: fix a not link up issue when fibre port supports autoneg

When fibre port supports auto-negotiation, the IMP(Intelligent
Management Process) processes the speed of auto-negotiation
and the  user's speed separately.
For below case, the port will get a not link up problem.
step 1: disables auto-negotiation and sets speed to A, then
the driver's MAC speed will be updated to A.
step 2: enables auto-negotiation and MAC gets negotiated
speed B, then the driver's MAC speed will be updated to B
through querying in periodical task.
step 3: MAC gets new negotiated speed A.
step 4: disables auto-negotiation and sets speed to B before
periodical task query new MAC speed A, the driver will  ignore
the speed configuration.

This patch fixes it by skipping speed and duplex checking when
fibre port supports auto-negotiation.
