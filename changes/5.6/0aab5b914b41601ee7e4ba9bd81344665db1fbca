arm64: dts: renesas: Group tuples in interrupt properties

To improve human readability and enable automatic validation, the tuples
in the various properties containing interrupt specifiers should be
grouped.  While "make dtbs_check" does not impose this yet for the
"interrupts" property, it does for the "interrupt-map" property.

Fix this by grouping the tuples of the "interrupts" and "interrupt-map"
properties using angle brackets.
