drm/msm/dsi/pll: call vco set rate explicitly

For a given byte clock, if VCO recalc value is exactly same as
vco set rate value, vco_set_rate does not get called assuming
VCO is already set to required value. But Due to GDSC toggle,
VCO values are erased in the HW. To make sure VCO is programmed
correctly, we forcefully call set_rate from vco_prepare.
