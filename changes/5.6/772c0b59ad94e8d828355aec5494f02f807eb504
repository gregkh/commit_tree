drm/amd/display: Increase the number of retries after AUX DEFER

[Why]
When a timeout occurs after a DEFER, some devices require more retries
than in the case of a regular timeout.

[How]
In a timeout occurrence, check whether a DEFER has occurred before the
timeout and retry MAX_DEFER_RETRIES retries times instead of
MAX_TIMEOUT_RETRIES.
