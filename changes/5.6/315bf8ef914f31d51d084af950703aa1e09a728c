btrfs: reset fs_root to NULL on error in open_ctree

While running my error injection script I hit a panic when we tried to
clean up the fs_root when freeing the fs_root.  This is because
fs_info->fs_root == PTR_ERR(-EIO), which isn't great.  Fix this by
setting fs_info->fs_root = NULL; if we fail to read the root.
