tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Fix RX cancel command failure

RX cancel command fails when BT is switched on and off multiple times.

To handle this, poll for the cancel bit in SE_GENI_S_IRQ_STATUS register
instead of SE_GENI_S_CMD_CTRL_REG.

As per the HPG update, handle the RX last bit after cancel command
and flush out the RX FIFO buffer.
