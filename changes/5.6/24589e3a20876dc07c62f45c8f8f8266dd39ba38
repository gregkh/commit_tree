tracing: Use pr_err() instead of WARN() for memory failures

As warnings can trigger panics, especially when "panic_on_warn" is set,
memory failure warnings can cause panics and fail fuzz testers that are
stressing memory.

Create a MEM_FAIL() macro to use instead of WARN() in the tracing code
(perhaps this should be a kernel wide macro?), and use that for memory
failure issues. This should stop failing fuzz tests due to warnings.
