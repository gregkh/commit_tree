cxgb4/chtls: fix ULD connection failures due to wrong TID base

Currently, the hardware TID index is assumed to start from index 0.
However, with the following changeset,

commit c21939998802 ("cxgb4: add support for high priority filters")

hardware TID index can start after the high priority region, which
has introduced a regression resulting in connection failures for
ULDs.

So, fix all related code to properly recalculate the TID start index
based on whether high priority filters are enabled or not.
