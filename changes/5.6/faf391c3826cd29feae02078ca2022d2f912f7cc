tcp: Define IPPROTO_MPTCP

To open a MPTCP socket with socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, IPPROTO_MPTCP),
IPPROTO_MPTCP needs a value that differs from IPPROTO_TCP. The existing
IPPROTO numbers mostly map directly to IANA-specified protocol numbers.
MPTCP does not have a protocol number allocated because MPTCP packets
use the TCP protocol number. Use private number not used OTA.
