ARM: dts: ux500: Add aliases for I2C and SPI buses

Now that we disable the I2C/SPI buses by default, is is even more
important to assign aliases to the I2C/SPI device nodes.
Otherwise, enabling/disabling one of them will potentially change
all device IDs, e.g. i2c2 will be named i2c-0 if it is the only
enabled I2C bus.

Add aliases for the I2C and SPI buses to avoid this.
