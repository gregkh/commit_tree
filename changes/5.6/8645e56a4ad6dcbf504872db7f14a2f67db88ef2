xen: Enable interrupts when calling _cond_resched()

xen_maybe_preempt_hcall() is called from the exception entry point
xen_do_hypervisor_callback with interrupts disabled.

_cond_resched() evades the might_sleep() check in cond_resched() which
would have caught that and schedule_debug() unfortunately lacks a check
for irqs_disabled().

Enable interrupts around the call and use cond_resched() to catch future
issues.
