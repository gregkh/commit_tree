net/mlx5: DR, Create multiple destination action from dr_create_fte

Until now it was possible to pass a packet to a single destination such
as vport or flow table. With the new support if multiple vports or multiple
tables are provided as destinations, fs_dr will create a multiple
destination table action, this action should replace other destination
actions provided to mlx5dr_create_rule.
Each vport destination can be provided with a reformat actions which
will be done before forwarding the packet to the vport.
