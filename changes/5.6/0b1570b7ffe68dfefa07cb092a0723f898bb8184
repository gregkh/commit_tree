drm/i915: Protect i915_request_await_start from early waits

We need to be extremely careful inside i915_request_await_start() as it
needs to walk the list of requests in the foreign timeline with very
little protection. As we hold our own timeline mutex, we can not nest
inside the signaler's timeline mutex, so all that remains is our RCU
protection. However, to be safe we need to tell the compiler that we may
be traversing the list only under RCU protection, and furthermore we
need to start declaring requests as elements of the timeline from their
construction.
