KVM: x86: Refactor and rename bit() to feature_bit() macro

Rename bit() to __feature_bit() to give it a more descriptive name, and
add a macro, feature_bit(), to stuff the X68_FEATURE_ prefix to keep
line lengths manageable for code that hardcodes the bit to be retrieved.

No functional change intended.
