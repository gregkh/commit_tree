s390/zcrypt: enable card/domain autoselect on ep11 cprbs

For EP11 CPRBs there was only to choose between specify
one or more ep11 targets or not give a target at all. Without
any target the zcrypt code assumed AUTOSELECT. For EP11 this
ended up in choosing any EP11 APQN with regards to the weight.

However, CCA CPRBs can have a more fine granular target
addressing. The caller can give 0xFFFF as AUTOSELECT for
the card and/or the domain. So it's possible to address
any card but domain given or any domain but card given.

This patch now introduces the very same for EP11 CPRB handling.
An EP11 target entry now may contain 0xFFFF as card and/or
domain value with the meaning of ANY card or domain. So
now the same behavior as with CCA CPRBs becomes possible:
Address any card with given domain or address any domain within
given card.

For convenience the zcrypt.h header file now has two new
defines AUTOSEL_AP and AUTOSEL_DOM covering the 0xFFFF
value to address card any and domain any.
