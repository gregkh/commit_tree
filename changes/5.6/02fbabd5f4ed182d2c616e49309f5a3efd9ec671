regulator: stm32-vrefbuf: fix a possible overshoot when re-enabling

There maybe an overshoot, when disabling, then re-enabling vrefbuf
too quickly. VREFBUF is used by ADC/DAC on some boards. When re-enabling
too quickly, an overshoot on the reference voltage make the conversions
inaccurate for a short period of time.
- Don't put the VREFBUF in HiZ when disabling, to force an active
discharge.
- Enforce a 1ms OFF/ON delay
