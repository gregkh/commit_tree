firmware: qcom_scm-64: Add SCM results struct

Remove knowledge of arm_smccc_res struct from client wrappers so that
client wrappers only work QCOM SCM data structures. SCM calls may have
up to 3 arguments, so qcom_scm_call_smccc is responsible now for filling
those 3 arguments accordingly. This is necessary to support merging
legacy and SMC conventions in an upcoming patch.
