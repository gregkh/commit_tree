KVM: x86/mmu: WARN if root_hpa is invalid when handling a page fault

WARN if root_hpa is invalid when handling a page fault.  The check on
root_hpa exists for historical reasons that no longer apply to the
current KVM code base.

Remove an equivalent debug-only warning in direct_page_fault(), whose
existence more or less confirms that root_hpa should always be valid
when handling a page fault.
