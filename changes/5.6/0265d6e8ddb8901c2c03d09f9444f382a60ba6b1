xen/blkfront: limit allocated memory size to actual use case

Today the Xen blkfront driver allocates memory for one struct
blkfront_ring_info for each communication ring. This structure is
statically sized for the maximum supported configuration resulting
in a size of more than 90 kB.

As the main size contributor is one array inside the struct, the
memory allocation can easily be limited by moving this array to be
the last structure element and to allocate only the memory for the
actually needed array size.
