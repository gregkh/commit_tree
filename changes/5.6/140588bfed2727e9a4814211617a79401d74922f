s390: remove obsolete ieee_emulation_warnings

s390 math emulation was removed with commit 5a79859ae0f3 ("s390:
remove 31 bit support"), rendering ieee_emulation_warnings useless.
The code still built because it was protected by CONFIG_MATHEMU, which
was no longer selectable.

This patch removes the sysctl_ieee_emulation_warnings declaration and
the sysctl entry declaration.
