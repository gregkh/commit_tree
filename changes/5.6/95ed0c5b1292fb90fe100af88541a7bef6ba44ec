blk-mq: optimise blk_mq_flush_plug_list()

Instead of using list_del_init() in a loop, that generates a lot of
unnecessary memory read/writes, iterate from the first request of a
batch and cut out a sublist with list_cut_before().

Apart from removing the list node initialisation part, this is more
register-friendly, and the assembly uses the stack less intensively.

list_empty() at the beginning is done with hope, that the compiler can
optimise out the same check in the following list_splice_init().
