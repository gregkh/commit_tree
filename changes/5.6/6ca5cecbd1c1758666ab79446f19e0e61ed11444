ASoC: SOF: Introduce state machine for FW boot

Add a state machine for FW boot to track the
different stages of FW boot and replace the boot_complete
field with fw_state field in struct snd_sof_dev.
This will be used to determine the actions to be performed
during system suspend.

One of the main motivations for adding this change is the
fact that errors during the top-level SOF device probe cannot
be propagated and therefore suspending the SOF device normally
during system suspend could potentially run into errors.
For example, with the current flow, if the FW boot failed
for some reason and the system suspends, the SOF device
suspend could fail because the CTX_SAVE IPC would be attempted
even though the FW never really booted successfully causing it
to time out. Another scenario that the state machine fixes
is when the runtime suspend for the SOF device fails and
the DSP is powered down nevertheless, the CTX_SAVE IPC during
system suspend would timeout because the DSP is already
powered down.
