inet_diag: return classid for all socket types

In commit 1ec17dbd90f8 ("inet_diag: fix reporting cgroup classid and
fallback to priority") croup classid reporting was fixed. But this works
only for TCP sockets because for other socket types icsk parameter can
be NULL and classid code path is skipped. This change moves classid
handling to inet_diag_msg_attrs_fill() function.

Also inet_diag_msg_attrs_size() helper was added and addends in
nlmsg_new() were reordered to save order from inet_sk_diag_fill().
