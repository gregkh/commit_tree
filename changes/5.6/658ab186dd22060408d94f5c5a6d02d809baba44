pci/hotplug/pnv-php: Remove erroneous warning

On powernv, when removing a device through hotplug, the following
warning is logged:

     Invalid refcount <.> on <...>

It may be incorrect, the refcount may be set to a higher value than 1
and be valid. of_detach_node() can drop more than one reference. As it
doesn't seem trivial to assert the correct value, let's remove the
warning.
