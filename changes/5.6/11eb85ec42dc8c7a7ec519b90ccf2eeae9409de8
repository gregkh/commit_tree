Bluetooth: Fix race condition in hci_release_sock()

Syzbot managed to trigger a use after free "KASAN: use-after-free Write
in hci_sock_bind".  I have reviewed the code manually and one possibly
cause I have found is that we are not holding lock_sock(sk) when we do
the hci_dev_put(hdev) in hci_sock_release().  My theory is that the bind
and the release are racing against each other which results in this use
after free.
