ceph: do not execute direct write in parallel if O_APPEND is specified

In O_APPEND & O_DIRECT mode, the data from different writers will
be possibly overlapping each other since they take the shared lock.

For example, both Writer1 and Writer2 are in O_APPEND and O_DIRECT
mode:

          Writer1                         Writer2

     shared_lock()                   shared_lock()
     getattr(CAP_SIZE)               getattr(CAP_SIZE)
     iocb->ki_pos = EOF              iocb->ki_pos = EOF
     write(data1)
                                     write(data2)
     shared_unlock()                 shared_unlock()

The data2 will overlap the data1 from the same file offset, the
old EOF.

Switch to exclusive lock instead when O_APPEND is specified.
