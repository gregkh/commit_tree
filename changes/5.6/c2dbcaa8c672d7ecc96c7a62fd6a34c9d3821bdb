dmaengine: plx-dma: Implement hardware initialization and cleanup

Allocate DMA coherent memory for the ring of DMA descriptors and
program the appropriate hardware registers.

A tasklet is created which is triggered on an interrupt to process
all the finished requests. Additionally, any remaining descriptors
are aborted when the hardware is removed or the resources freed.

Use an RCU pointer to synchronize PCI device unbind.
