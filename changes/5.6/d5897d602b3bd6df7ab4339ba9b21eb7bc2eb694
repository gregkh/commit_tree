ARM: dts: qcom: apq8084: Change tsens definition to new style

This patch changes the tsens peripheral definition to the new style,
which fixes a kernel panic caused by a change in the tsens driver,
introduced by commit 37624b58542fb9f2d9a70e6ea006ef8a5f66c30b.  There
was a patch submitted recently to this list that should fix this problem
with old device trees and the new driver, so it may be redundant at this
point, in terms of fixing the kernel panic, but this should align the
APQ8084 device tree with the others.
