tipc: make legacy address flag readable over netlink

To enable iproute2/tipc to generate backwards compatible
printouts and validate command parameters for nodes using a
<z.c.n> node address, it needs to be able to read the legacy
address flag from the kernel.  The legacy address flag records
the way in which the node identity was originally specified.

The legacy address flag is requested by the netlink message
TIPC_NL_ADDR_LEGACY_GET.  If the flag is set the attribute
TIPC_NLA_NET_ADDR_LEGACY is set in the return message.
