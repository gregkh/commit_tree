crypto: hash - add support for new way of freeing instances

Add support to shash and ahash for the new way of freeing instances
(already used for skcipher, aead, and akcipher) where a ->free() method
is installed to the instance struct itself.  These methods are more
strongly-typed than crypto_template::free(), which they replace.

This will allow removing support for the old way of freeing instances.
