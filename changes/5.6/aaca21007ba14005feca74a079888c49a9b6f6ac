KVM: SVM: Fix the svm vmexit code for WRMSR

In svm, exit_code for MSR writes is not EXIT_REASON_MSR_WRITE which
belongs to vmx.

According to amd manual, SVM_EXIT_MSR(7ch) is the exit_code of VMEXIT_MSR
due to RDMSR or WRMSR access to protected MSR. Additionally, the processor
indicates in the VMCB's EXITINFO1 whether a RDMSR(EXITINFO1=0) or
WRMSR(EXITINFO1=1) was intercepted.
