qed: FW 8.42.2.0 Queue Manager changes

This patch contains changes in initialization and usage of the QM blocks.
Instead of setting a rate limiter per vport the rate limiters are now a
global resource and set independentaly.

The patch also contains a field name change:
vport_wfq which is part of vport_params was renamed to wfq as the vport
prefix is redundant.
