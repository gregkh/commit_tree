gpio: Fix the no return statement warning

In commit 242587616710 ("gpiolib: Add support for the irqdomain which
doesn't use irq_fwspec as arg") we have changed the return type of
gpiochip_populate_parent_fwspec_twocell/fourcell() from void to void *,
but forgot to add a return statement for these two dummy functions.
Add "return NULL" to fix the build warnings.
