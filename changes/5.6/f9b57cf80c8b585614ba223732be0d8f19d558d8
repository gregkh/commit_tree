x86/mm/pat: Move the memtype related files to arch/x86/mm/pat/

- pat.c offers, dominantly, the memtype APIs - so rename it to memtype.c.

- pageattr.c is offering, primarily, the set_memory*() page attribute APIs,
  which is offered via the <asm/set_memory.h> header: name the .c file
  along the same pattern.

I.e. perform these renames, and move them all next to each other in arch/x86/mm/pat/:

    pat.c             => memtype.c
    pat_internal.h    => memtype.h
    pat_interval.c    => memtype_interval.c

    pageattr.c        => set_memory.c
    pageattr-test.c   => cpa-test.c
