crypto: algapi - remove crypto_template::{alloc,free}()

Now that all templates provide a ->create() method which creates an
instance, installs a strongly-typed ->free() method directly to it, and
registers it, the older ->alloc() and ->free() methods in
'struct crypto_template' are no longer used.  Remove them.
