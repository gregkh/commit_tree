staging: next: configfs: fix release link

The functions link_destroy and link_release are both deleting list items.
link_release, however, does not check whether a certain link has already
been deleted from the list by function link_destroy. By fixing this
this patch prevents a kernel crash when removing the configuration
directory of a link that already has been destroyed.
