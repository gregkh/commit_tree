ALSA: hda: Clear RIRB status before reading WP

RIRB interrupt status getting cleared after the write pointer is read
causes a race condition, where last response(s) into RIRB may remain
unserviced by IRQ, eventually causing azx_rirb_get_response to fall
back to polling mode. Clearing the RIRB interrupt status ahead of
write pointer access ensures that this condition is avoided.
