IMA: pre-allocate buffer to hold keyrings string

ima_match_keyring() is called while holding rcu read lock. Since this
function executes in atomic context, it should not call any function
that can sleep (such as kstrdup()).

This patch pre-allocates a buffer to hold the keyrings string read from
the IMA policy and uses that to match the given keyring.
