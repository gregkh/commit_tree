dmaengine: sun4i: Add support for cyclic requests with dedicated DMA

Currently the cyclic transfers can be used only with normal DMAs. They
can be used by pcm_dmaengine module, which is required for implementing
sound with sun4i-hdmi encoder. This is so because the controller can
accept audio only from a dedicated DMA.

This patch enables them, following the existing style for the
scatter/gather type transfers.
