tracing: Add synth_event_delete()

create_or_delete_synth_event() contains code to delete a synthetic
event, which would be useful on its own - specifically, it would be
useful to allow event-creating modules to call it separately.

Separate out the delete code from that function and create an exported
function named synth_event_delete().
