drm/amdkfd: use kiq to load the mqd of hiq queue for gfx v9 (v6)

There is an issue that CP will check the HIQ queue to be configured and mapped
with KIQ ring, otherwise, it will be unable to read back the secure buffer while
the gfxoff is enabled even with trusted IP blocks.

v1 -> v2:
- Fix to remove surplus set_resources packets.
- Fill the whole configuration in MQD.
- Change the author as Aaron because he addressed the key point of this issue.
- Add kiq ring lock.

v2 -> v3:
- Free the lock while in error return case.
- Remove the programming only needed by the queue is unmapped.

v3 -> v4:
- Remove doorbell programming because it's used for restarting queue.
- Remove CP scheduler programming because map_queue packet will handle this.

v4 -> v5:
- Remove cp_hqd_active because mec ucode will enable it while use map_queues.
- Revise goto out_unlock.
- Correct the right doorbell offset for HIQ that kfd driver assigned in the
  packet.

v5 -> v6:
- Merge Arcturus fix into this patch because it will get oops in Arcturus
  platform.
