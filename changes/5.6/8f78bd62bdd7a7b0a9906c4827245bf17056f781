irqchip/meson-gpio: Add support for meson a1 SoCs

The meson a1 Socs have some changes compared with previous
chips. For A113L, it contains 62 pins and can be spied on:

- 62:128 undefined
- 61:50 12 pins on bank A
- 49:37 13 pins on bank F
- 36:20 17 pins on bank X
- 19:13 7  pins on bank B
- 12:0  13 pins on bank P

There are five relative registers for gpio interrupt controller,
details are as below:

- PADCTRL_GPIO_IRQ_CTRL0
  bit[31]:    enable/disable the whole irq lines
  bit[16-23]: both edge trigger
  bit[8-15]:  single edge trigger
  bit[0-7]:   pol trigger

- PADCTRL_GPIO_IRQ_CTRL[X]
  bit[0-6]:   7 bits to choose gpio source for irq line 2*[X] - 2
  bit[16-22]: 7 bits to choose gpio source for irq line 2*[X] - 1
  where X =1,2,3,4
