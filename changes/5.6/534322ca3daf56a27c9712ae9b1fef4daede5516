ipv4/tcp: Pass dif and sdif to tcp_v4_inbound_md5_hash

The original ingress device index is saved to the cb space of the skb
and the cb is moved during tcp processing. Since tcp_v4_inbound_md5_hash
can be called before and after the cb move, pass dif and sdif to it so
the caller can save both prior to the cb move. Both are used by a later
patch.
