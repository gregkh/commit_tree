io_uring: fix lockup with timeouts

There is a recipe to deadlock the kernel: submit a timeout sqe with a
linked_timeout (e.g.  test_single_link_timeout_ception() from liburing),
and SIGKILL the process.

Then, io_kill_timeouts() takes @ctx->completion_lock, but the timeout
isn't flagged with REQ_F_COMP_LOCKED, and will try to double grab it
during io_put_free() to cancel the linked timeout. Probably, the same
can happen with another io_kill_timeout() call site, that is
io_commit_cqring().
