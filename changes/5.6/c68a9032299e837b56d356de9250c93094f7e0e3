riscv: set pmp configuration if kernel is running in M-mode

When the kernel is running in S-mode, the expectation is that the
bootloader or SBI layer will configure the PMP to allow the kernel to
access physical memory.  But, when the kernel is running in M-mode and is
started with the ELF "loader", there's probably no bootloader or SBI layer
involved to configure the PMP.  Thus, we need to configure the PMP
ourselves to enable the kernel to access all regions.
