net/wan/fsl_ucc_hdlc: reject muram offsets above 64K

Qiang Zhao points out that these offsets get written to 16-bit
registers, and there are some QE platforms with more than 64K
muram. So it is possible that qe_muram_alloc() gives us an allocation
that can't actually be used by the hardware, so detect and reject
that.
