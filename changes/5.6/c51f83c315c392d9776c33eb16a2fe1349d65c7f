rcu: Use READ_ONCE() for ->expmask in rcu_read_unlock_special()

The rcu_node structure's ->expmask field is updated only when holding the
->lock, but is also accessed locklessly.  This means that all ->expmask
updates must use WRITE_ONCE() and all reads carried out without holding
->lock must use READ_ONCE().  This commit therefore changes the lockless
->expmask read in rcu_read_unlock_special() to use READ_ONCE().
