livepatch/selftest: Clean up shadow variable names and type

The shadow variable selftest is quite tricky. Especially it is problematic
to understand what values are stored, returned, and printed.

Make it easier to understand by using "int *var, **sv" variables
consistently everywhere instead of the generic "void *", "ret",
and "ctor_data".
