fcnal-test: Fix vrf argument in local tcp tests

The recent MD5 tests added duplicate configuration in the default VRF.
This change exposed a bug in existing tests designed to verify no
connection when client and server are not in the same domain. The
server should be running bound to the vrf device with the client run
in the default VRF (the -2 option is meant for validating connection
data). Fix the option for both tests.

While technically this is a bug in previous releases, the tests are
properly failing since the default VRF does not have any routing
configuration so there really is no need to backport to prior releases.
