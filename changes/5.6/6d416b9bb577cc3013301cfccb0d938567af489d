pinctrl: intel: Add GPIO <-> pin mapping ranges via callback

When IRQ chip is instantiated via GPIO library flow, the few functions,
in particular the ACPI event registration mechanism, on some of ACPI based
platforms expect that the pin ranges are initialized to that point.

Add GPIO <-> pin mapping ranges via callback in the GPIO library flow.
