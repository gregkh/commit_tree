compat_ioctl: simplify the implementation

Now that both native and compat ioctl syscalls are
in the same file, a couple of simplifications can
be made, bringing the implementation closer together:

- do_vfs_ioctl(), ioctl_preallocate(), and compat_ioctl_preallocate()
  can become static, allowing the compiler to optimize better

- slightly update the coding style for consistency between
  the functions.

- rather than listing each command in two switch statements
  for the compat case, just call a single function that has
  all the common commands.

As a side-effect, FS_IOC_RESVSP/FS_IOC_RESVSP64 are now available
to x86 compat tasks, along with FS_IOC_RESVSP_32/FS_IOC_RESVSP64_32.
This is harmless for i386 emulation, and can be considered a bugfix
for x32 emulation, which never supported these in the past.
