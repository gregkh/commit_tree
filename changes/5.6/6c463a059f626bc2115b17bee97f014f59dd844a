nfp: flower: handle notifiers for ipv6 route changes

A notifier is used to track route changes in the kernel. If a change is
made to a route that is offloaded to fw then an update is sent to the NIC.
The driver tracks all routes that are offloaded to determine if a kernel
change is of interest.

Extend the notifier to track IPv6 route changes and create a new list that
stores offloaded IPv6 routes. Modify the IPv4 route helper functions to
accept varying address lengths. This way, the same core functions can be
used to handle IPv4 and IPv6.
