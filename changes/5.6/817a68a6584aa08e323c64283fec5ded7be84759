IB/hfi1, qib: Ensure RCU is locked when accessing list

The packet handling function, specifically the iteration of the qp list
for mad packet processing misses locking RCU before running through the
list. Not only is this incorrect, but the list_for_each_entry_rcu() call
can not be called with a conditional check for lock dependency. Remedy
this by invoking the rcu lock and unlock around the critical section.

This brings MAD packet processing in line with what is done for non-MAD
packets.
