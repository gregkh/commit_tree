netfilter: ipset: Fix forceadd evaluation path

When the forceadd option is enabled, the hash:* types should find and replace
the first entry in the bucket with the new one if there are no reuseable
(deleted or timed out) entries. However, the position index was just not set
to zero and remained the invalid -1 if there were no reuseable entries.
