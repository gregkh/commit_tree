KVM: VMX: Drop initialization of IA32_FEAT_CTL MSR

Remove KVM's code to initialize IA32_FEAT_CTL MSR when KVM is loaded now
that the MSR is initialized during boot on all CPUs that support VMX,
i.e. on all CPUs that can possibly load kvm_intel.

Note, don't WARN if IA32_FEAT_CTL is unlocked, even though the MSR is
unconditionally locked by init_ia32_feat_ctl().  KVM isn't tied directly
to a CPU vendor detection, whereas init_ia32_feat_ctl() is invoked if
and only if the CPU vendor is recognized and known to support VMX.  As a
result, vmx_disabled_by_bios() may be reached without going through
init_ia32_feat_ctl() and thus without locking IA32_FEAT_CTL.  This quirk
will be eliminated in a future patch.
