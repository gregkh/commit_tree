compat_ioctl: move HDIO ioctl handling into drivers/ide

Most of the HDIO ioctls are only used by the obsolete drivers/ide
subsystem, these can be handled by changing ide_cmd_ioctl() to be aware
of compat mode and doing the correct transformations in place and using
it as both native and compat handlers for all drivers.

The SCSI drivers implementing the same commands are already doing
this in the drivers, so the compat_blkdev_driver_ioctl() function
is no longer needed now.

The BLKSECTSET and HDIO_GETGEO_BIG ioctls are not implemented
in any driver any more and no longer need any conversion.
