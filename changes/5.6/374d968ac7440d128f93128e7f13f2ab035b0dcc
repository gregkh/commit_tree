media: atmel: atmel-isc-base: initialize the try_crop for the pads in try_fmt

When requesting format from sensor, some sensors call the
subdev_get_try_crop which for ISC was not properly initialized, and this
causes errors in determining proper image resolutions.
To accommodate for this, when trying a format (in try_fmt), first attempt
to obtain the framesize for this format from sensor.
In case this fails, use the maximum ISC width/height as try_crop, otherwise
provide the first size height/width from the sensor.
