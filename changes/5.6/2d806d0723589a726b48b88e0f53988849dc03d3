x86/mce: Pass MCE message to mce_panic() on failed kernel recovery

In commit

  b2f9d678e28c ("x86/mce: Check for faults tagged in EXTABLE_CLASS_FAULT exception table entries")

another call to mce_panic() was introduced. Pass the message of the
handled MCE to that instance of mce_panic() as well, as there doesn't
seem to be a reason not to.
