mmc: sdhci-of-at91: fix cd-gpios for SAMA5D2

SAMA5D2x doesn't drive CMD line if GPIO is used as CD line (at least
SAMA5D27 doesn't). Fix this by forcing card-detect in the module
if module-controlled CD is not used.

Fixed commit addresses the problem only for non-removable cards. This
amends it to also cover gpio-cd case.
