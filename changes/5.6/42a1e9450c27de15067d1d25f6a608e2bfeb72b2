ARM: dts: ux500: Add devicetree for HREF520

This reference design is very similar to the others just that
it has a different display mounted on the user interface
board, and some GPIOs where shuffled around.

As this is the first board that uses DB8520 we create the
DB8520-specific DTSI file here.
