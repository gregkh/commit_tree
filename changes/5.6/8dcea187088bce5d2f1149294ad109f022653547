net: bridge: vlan: add rtm definitions and dump support

This patch adds vlan rtm definitions:
 - NEWVLAN: to be used for creating vlans, setting options and
   notifications
 - DELVLAN: to be used for deleting vlans
 - GETVLAN: used for dumping vlan information

Dumping vlans which can span multiple messages is added now with basic
information (vid and flags). We use nlmsg_parse() to validate the header
length in order to be able to extend the message with filtering
attributes later.
