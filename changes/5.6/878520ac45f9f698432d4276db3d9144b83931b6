ext4: save the error code which triggered an ext4_error() in the superblock

This allows the cause of an ext4_error() report to be categorized
based on whether it was triggered due to an I/O error, or an memory
allocation error, or other possible causes.  Most errors are caused by
a detected file system inconsistency, so the default code stored in
the superblock will be EXT4_ERR_EFSCORRUPTED.
