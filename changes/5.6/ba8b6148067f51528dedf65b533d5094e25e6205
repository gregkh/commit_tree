nfs_clone_sb_security(): simplify the check for server bogosity

We used to check ->i_op for being nfs_dir_inode_operations.  With
separate inode_operations for v3 and v4 that became bogus, but
rather than going for protocol-dependent comparison we could've
just checked ->i_fop instead; _that_ is the same for all protocol
versions.
