net: ena: fix corruption of dev_idx_to_host_tbl

The function ena_com_ind_tbl_convert_from_device() has an overflow
bug as explained below. Either way, this function is not needed at
all since we don't retrieve the indirection table from the device
at any point which means that this conversion is not needed.

The bug:
The for loop iterates over all io_sq_queues, when passing the actual
number of used queues the io_sq_queues[i].idx equals 0 since they are
uninitialized which results in the following code to be executed till
the end of the loop:

dev_idx_to_host_tbl[0] = i;

This results dev_idx_to_host_tbl[0] in being equal to
ENA_TOTAL_NUM_QUEUES - 1.
