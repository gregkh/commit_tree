iommu/amd: Fix IOMMU AVIC not properly update the is_run bit in IRTE

Commit b9c6ff94e43a ("iommu/amd: Re-factor guest virtual APIC
(de-)activation code") accidentally left out the ir_data pointer when
calling modity_irte_ga(), which causes the function amd_iommu_update_ga()
to return prematurely due to struct amd_ir_data.ref is NULL and
the "is_run" bit of IRTE does not get updated properly.

This results in bad I/O performance since IOMMU AVIC always generate GA Log
entry and notify IOMMU driver and KVM when it receives interrupt from the
PCI pass-through device instead of directly inject interrupt to the vCPU.

Fixes by passing ir_data when calling modify_irte_ga() as done previously.
