tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Fix result display for turbo-freq auto mode

The turbo-freq enable with auto mode, prints result for the last possible
CPU, which is not correct when either CPU is not present or user wants
command to be limited to a single die/package. For example, in the
below command user wants to limit to die/package 0, but the
"turbo-freq --auto" result is displayed using the other package.

$ sudo intel-speed-select -c 0 turbo-freq enable -a
Intel(R) Speed Select Technology
 package-0
  die-0
    cpu-0
      turbo-freq
        enable:success
 package--1
  die-0
    cpu-31
      turbo-freq --auto
        enable:success

Since we do have to traverse all CPUs, don't display CPU info for
"turbo-freq --auto", as we already displayed the result for
turbo-freq enable with the CPU information.

With the fix, the same command results in:

$ sudo intel-speed-select -c 0 turbo-freq enable -a
Intel(R) Speed Select Technology
package-0
  die-0
    cpu-0
      turbo-freq
        enable:success
      turbo-freq --auto
        enable:success
