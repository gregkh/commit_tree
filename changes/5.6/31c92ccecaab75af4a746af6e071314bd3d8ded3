net: hns3: remove useless mutex vport_cfg_mutex in the struct hclge_dev

Mutex vport_cfg_mutex has been used to protect uc_mac_list,
mc_mac_list and vlan_list from being modified by unloading
or reset task at the same time. But now unloading will
set up HCLGE_STATE_REMOVING flag and call cancel_work_sync to
break down this race condition, so this mutex is unnecessary.
