iwlwifi: mvm: update the DTS measurement type

Till now, the driver asked the fw for a DTS measurement in automatic
mode. This triggered a flow in which the fw actively measured the
temperature.  This is not needed anymore, as the fw performs
measurements by itself, without the driver triggering them, and the
current cadence in which the fw performs such measurements is
sufficient.

In addition, in some time-sensitive scenarios, in which the driver asks
the fw for an active measurement twice in a short time (<100ms), the fw
asserts with code 0x20100801.

Change the DTS measurement to _WITHOUT_MEASURE instead, so the fw will
respond with the last measurement it has performed.
