efi/libstub/x86: Use mandatory 16-byte stack alignment in mixed mode

Reduce the stack frame of the EFI stub's mixed mode thunk routine by
8 bytes, by moving the GDT and return addresses to EBP and EBX, which
we need to preserve anyway, since their top halves will be cleared by
the call into 32-bit firmware code. Doing so results in the UEFI code
being entered with a 16 byte aligned stack, as mandated by the UEFI
spec, fixing the last occurrence in the 64-bit kernel where we violate
this requirement.

Also, move the saved GDT from a global variable to an unused part of the
stack frame, and touch up some other parts of the code.
