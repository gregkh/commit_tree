x86/mce: Remove mce_inject_log() in favor of mce_log()

The mutex in mce_inject_log() became unnecessary with commit

  5de97c9f6d85 ("x86/mce: Factor out and deprecate the /dev/mcelog driver"),

though the original reason for its presence only vanished with commit

  7298f08ea887 ("x86/mcelog: Get rid of RCU remnants").

Drop the mutex. And as that makes mce_inject_log() identical to mce_log(),
get rid of the former in favor of the latter.
