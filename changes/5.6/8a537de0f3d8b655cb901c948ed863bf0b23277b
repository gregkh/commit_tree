drm/doc: Update IGT documentation

The IGT documentation in this page is telling us to build it using
make. According to commit 67993c1 ("automake: Point builders at
meson") from the IGT project, this is deprecated and IGT should be
built with meson. Instead of having a documentation for IGT in this
page, point to their GitLab README, which should always be up to
date.
