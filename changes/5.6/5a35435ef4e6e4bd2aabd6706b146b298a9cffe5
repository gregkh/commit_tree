soc: fsl: qe: remove PPC32 dependency from CONFIG_QUICC_ENGINE

There are also PPC64, ARM and ARM64 based SOCs with a QUICC Engine,
and the core QE code as well as net/wan/fsl_ucc_hdlc and
tty/serial/ucc_uart has now been modified to not rely on ppcisms.

So extend the architectures that can select QUICC_ENGINE, and add the
rather modest requirements of OF && HAS_IOMEM.

The core code as well as the ucc_uart driver has been tested on an
LS1021A (arm), and it has also been tested that the QE code still
works on an mpc8309 (ppc). Qiang Zhao has tested that the QE-HDLC code
that gets enabled with this works on ARM64.
