tracing: Don't return -EINVAL when tracing soft disabled synth events

There's no reason to return -EINVAL when tracing a synthetic event if
it's soft disabled - treat it the same as if it were hard disabled and
return normally.

Have synth_event_trace() and synth_event_trace_array() just return
normally, and have synth_event_trace_start set the trace state to
disabled and return.
