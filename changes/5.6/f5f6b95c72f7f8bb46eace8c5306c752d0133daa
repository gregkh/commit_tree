virtio-blk: fix hw_queue stopped on arbitrary error

Since nobody else is going to restart our hw_queue for us, the
blk_mq_start_stopped_hw_queues() is in virtblk_done() is not sufficient
necessarily sufficient to ensure that the queue will get started again.
In case of global resource outage (-ENOMEM because mapping failure,
because of swiotlb full) our virtqueue may be empty and we can get
stuck with a stopped hw_queue.

Let us not stop the queue on arbitrary errors, but only on -EONSPC which
indicates a full virtqueue, where the hw_queue is guaranteed to get
started by virtblk_done() before when it makes sense to carry on
submitting requests. Let us also remove a stale comment.
