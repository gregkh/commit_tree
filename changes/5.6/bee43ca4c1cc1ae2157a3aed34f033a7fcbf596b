drm/i915: Clean up intel_{pre,post}_plane_update()

Change the calling convention to just pass the state+crtc and
switch to intel_ types throughout.

We'll also do a quick s/if (old_primary_state)/if (new_primary_state)/
so that we'll be able to eliminate old_primary_state later. This
is fine since we always have either both old and new state or neither.
