drm/i915/dsi: Move poking of panel-enable GPIO to intel_dsi_vbt.c

On some older devices (BYT, CHT) which may use v2 VBT MIPI-sequences,
we need to manually control the panel enable GPIO as v2 sequences do
not do this.

So far we have been carrying the code to do this on BYT/CHT devices
with a Crystal Cove PMIC in vlv_dsi.c, but as this really is a shortcoming
of the VBT MIPI-sequences, intel_dsi_vbt.c is a better place for this,
so move it there.

This is a preparation patch for adding panel-enable and backlight-enable
GPIO support for BYT devices where instead of the PMIC the SoC is used
for backlight control.
