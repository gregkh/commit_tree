clk: gpio: Use DT way of specifying parents

Nobody has used the gpio clk registration functions nor the gpio clk_ops
exposed by the basic gpio clk type. Let's remove all those APIs and move
the gpio clk support into the C file. Since nothing is using the
exported APIs, simplify the driver to be a platform driver that uses
clk_parent_data to pick 0th or 1st cell of the node's clocks property.
