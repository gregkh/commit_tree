usb: host: xhci-tegra: Use CNR as firmware ready indicator

The Falcon CPU state is a suboptimal indicator for firmware readiness,
since the Falcon can be in a running state if the firmware is handling
port state changes or running other tasks. Instead, the driver should
check the STS_CNR bit to determine whether or not the firmware has been
successfully loaded and is ready for XHCI operation.
