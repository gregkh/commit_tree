ACPI: PM: s2idle: Prevent spurious SCIs from waking up the system

If the platform triggers a spurious SCI even though the status bit
is not set for any GPE when the system is suspended to idle, it will
be treated as a genuine wakeup, so avoid that by checking if any GPEs
are active at all before returning 'true' from acpi_s2idle_wake().
