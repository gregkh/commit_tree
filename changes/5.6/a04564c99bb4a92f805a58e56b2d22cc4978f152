mac80211: consider more elements in parsing CRC

We only use the parsing CRC for checking if a beacon changed,
and elements with an ID > 63 cannot be represented in the
filter. Thus, like we did before with WMM and Cisco vendor
elements, just statically add these forgotten items to the
CRC:
 - WLAN_EID_VHT_OPERATION
 - WLAN_EID_OPMODE_NOTIF

I guess that in most cases when VHT/HE operation change, the HT
operation also changed, and so the change was picked up, but we
did notice that pure operating mode notification changes were
ignored.
