perf/cgroups: Install cgroup events to correct cpuctx

cgroup events are always installed in the cpuctx. However, when it is not
installed via IPI, list_update_cgroup_event() adds it to cpuctx of current
CPU, which triggers list corruption:

  [] list_add double add: new=ffff888ff7cf0db0, prev=ffff888ff7ce82f0, next=ffff888ff7cf0db0.

To reproduce this, we can simply run:

  # perf stat -e cs -a &
  # perf stat -e cs -G anycgroup

Fix this by installing it to cpuctx that contains event->ctx, and the
proper cgrp_cpuctx_list.
