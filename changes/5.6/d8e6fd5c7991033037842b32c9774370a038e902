btrfs: fix removal of raid[56|1c34} incompat flags after removing block group

We are incorrectly dropping the raid56 and raid1c34 incompat flags when
there are still raid56 and raid1c34 block groups, not when we do not any
of those anymore. The logic just got unintentionally broken after adding
the support for the raid1c34 modes.

Fix this by clear the flags only if we do not have block groups with the
respective profiles.
