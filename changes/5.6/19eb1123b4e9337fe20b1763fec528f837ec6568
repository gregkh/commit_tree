net: hns3: fix VF bandwidth does not take effect in some case

When enabling 4 TC after setting the bandwidth of VF, the bandwidth
of VF will resume to default value, because of the qset resources
changed in this case.

This patch fixes it by using a fixed VF's qset resources according to
HNAE3_MAX_TC macro.
