libperf: Setup initial evlist::all_cpus value

Jann Horn reported crash in perf ftrace because evlist::all_cpus isn't
initialized if there's evlist without events, which is the case for perf
ftrace.

Adding initial initialization of evlist::all_cpus from given cpus,
regardless of events in the evlist.
