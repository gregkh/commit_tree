ASoC: soc-core: rename snd_soc_add_dai_link() to snd_soc_add_pcm_runtime()

Now soc-core and soc-topology is using snd_soc_add_dai_link().
The abstract of this function is "create pcm_runtime from
dai_link information and connect it to card".
Thus, "add dai_link" is wrong/confusable naming.
This patch renames function name.
