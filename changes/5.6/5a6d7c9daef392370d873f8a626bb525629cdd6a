octeontx2-pf: Mailbox communication with AF

In the resource virtualization unit (RVU) each of the PF and AF
(admin function) share a 64KB of reserved memory region for
communication. This patch initializes PF <=> AF mailbox IRQs,
registers handlers for processing these communication messages.
Also adds support to process these messages in both directions
ie responses to PF initiated DOWN (PF => AF) messages and AF
initiated UP messages (AF => PF).

Mbox communication APIs and message formats are defined in AF driver
(drivers/net/ethernet/marvell/octeontx2/af), mbox.h from AF driver is
included here to avoid duplication.
