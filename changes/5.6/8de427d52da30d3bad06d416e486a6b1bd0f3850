clk: qcom: videocc: Update the clock flag for video_cc_vcodec0_core_clk

The clock disable signal for video_cc_vcodec0_core_clk is tied to
vcodec0_gdsc which is supported in the HW control mode. Thus turning off
the clock would be taken care automatically when the GDSC turns OFF by
hardware and clock driver does not require to poll on the CLK_OFF bit.
