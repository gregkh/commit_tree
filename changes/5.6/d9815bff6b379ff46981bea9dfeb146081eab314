ftrace: Return the first found result in lookup_rec()

It appears that ip ranges can overlap so. In that case lookup_rec()
returns whatever results it got last even if it found nothing in last
searched page.

This breaks an obscure livepatch late module patching usecase:
  - load livepatch
  - load the patched module
  - unload livepatch
  - try to load livepatch again

To fix this return from lookup_rec() as soon as it found the record
containing searched-for ip. This used to be this way prior lookup_rec()
introduction.
