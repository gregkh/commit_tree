CIFS: Add support for setting owner info, dos attributes, and create time

This is needed for backup/restore scenarios among others.

Add extended attribute "system.cifs_ntsd" (and alias "system.smb3_ntsd")
to allow for setting owner and DACL in the security descriptor. This is in
addition to the existing "system.cifs_acl" and "system.smb3_acl" attributes
that allow for setting DACL only. Add support for setting creation time and
dos attributes using set_file_info() calls to complement the existing
support for getting these attributes via query_path_info() calls.
