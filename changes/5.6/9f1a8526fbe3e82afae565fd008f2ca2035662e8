KVM: x86/mmu: Move nonpaging_page_fault() below try_async_pf()

Move nonpaging_page_fault() below try_async_pf() to eliminate the
forward declaration of try_async_pf() and to prepare for combining the
bulk of nonpaging_page_fault() and tdp_page_fault() into a common
helper.

No functional change intended.
