drm/ttm: fix leaking fences via ttm_buffer_object_transfer

Set the drm_device to NULL, so that the newly created buffer object
doesn't appear to use the embedded gem object.

This is necessary, because otherwise no corresponding dma_resv_fini for
the dma_resv_init is called, resulting in a memory leak.

The dma_resv_fini in ttm_bo_release_list is only called if the embedded
gem object is not used, which is determined by checking if the
drm_device is NULL.
