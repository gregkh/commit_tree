bootconfig: Reject subkey and value on same parent key

Reject if a value node is mixed with subkey node on same
parent key node.

A value node can not co-exist with subkey node under some key
node, e.g.

key = value
key.subkey = another-value

This is not be allowed because bootconfig API is not designed
to handle such case.
