crypto: ccp - provide in-kernel API to submit TEE commands

Extend the functionality of AMD Secure Processor (SP) driver by
providing an in-kernel API to submit commands to TEE ring buffer for
processing by Trusted OS running on AMD Secure Processor.

Following TEE commands are supported by Trusted OS:

* TEE_CMD_ID_LOAD_TA : Load Trusted Application (TA) binary into
  TEE environment
* TEE_CMD_ID_UNLOAD_TA : Unload TA binary from TEE environment
* TEE_CMD_ID_OPEN_SESSION : Open session with loaded TA
* TEE_CMD_ID_CLOSE_SESSION : Close session with loaded TA
* TEE_CMD_ID_INVOKE_CMD : Invoke a command with loaded TA
* TEE_CMD_ID_MAP_SHARED_MEM : Map shared memory
* TEE_CMD_ID_UNMAP_SHARED_MEM : Unmap shared memory

Linux AMD-TEE driver will use this API to submit command buffers
for processing in Trusted Execution Environment. The AMD-TEE driver
shall be introduced in a separate patch.
