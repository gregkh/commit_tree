net/mlx5: Fix lowest FDB pool size

The pool sizes represent the pool sizes in the fw. when we request
a pool size from fw, it will return the next possible group.
We track how many pools the fw has left and start requesting groups
from the big to the small.
When we start request 4k group, which doesn't exists in fw, fw
wants to allocate the next possible size, 64k, but will fail since
its exhausted. The correct smallest pool size in fw is 128 and not 4k.
