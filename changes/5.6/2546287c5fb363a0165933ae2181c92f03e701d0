genirq/irqdomain: Make sure all irq domain flags are distinct

This was noticed when printing debugfs for MSIs on my ARM64 server.  The
new dstate IRQD_MSI_NOMASK_QUIRK came out surprisingly while it should only
be the x86 stuff for the time being...

The new MSI quirk flag uses the same bit as IRQ_DOMAIN_NAME_ALLOCATED which
is oddly defined as bit 6 for no good reason.

Switch it to the non used bit 1.
