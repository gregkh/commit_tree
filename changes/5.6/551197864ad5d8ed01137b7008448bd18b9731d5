kbuild: detect missing include guard for exported headers

Adding an include guard to every header file is good practice in case
it is included multiple times.

Exported headers are compile-tested for the comprehensive sanity checks.
Let's include the same header twice. If an include guard is missing,
the header will fail to build due to redefinition of something.
