dmaengine: virt-dma: Do not call desc_free() under a spin_lock

vchan_vdesc_fini() shouldn't be called under a spin_lock. This is done
in two places, once in vchan_terminate_vdesc() and once in
vchan_synchronize(). Instead of freeing the vdesc right away, collect
the aborted vdescs on a separate list and free them along with the other
vdescs. The terminated descs are also freed in vchan_synchronize as done
before this patch.
