wil6210: fix break that is never reached because of zero'ing of a retry counter

There is a check on the retry counter invalid_buf_id_retry that is always
false because invalid_buf_id_retry is initialized to zero on each iteration
of a while-loop.  Fix this by initializing the retry counter before the
while-loop starts.
