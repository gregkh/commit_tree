powerpc/32s: Fix bad_kuap_fault()

At the moment, bad_kuap_fault() reports a fault only if a bad access
to userspace occurred while access to userspace was not granted.

But if a fault occurs for a write outside the allowed userspace
segment(s) that have been unlocked, bad_kuap_fault() fails to
detect it and the kernel loops forever in do_page_fault().

Fix it by checking that the accessed address is within the allowed
range.
