Input: axp20x-pek - make device attributes static

The two device attrbitues are not declared outside this file
so make them static to avoid the following warnings:

drivers/input/misc/axp20x-pek.c:194:1: warning: symbol 'dev_attr_startup' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/input/misc/axp20x-pek.c:195:1: warning: symbol 'dev_attr_shutdown' was not declared. Should it be static?
