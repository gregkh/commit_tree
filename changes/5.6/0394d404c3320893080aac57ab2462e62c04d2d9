clk: imx: Replace all the clk based helpers with macros

Replacing with macros all the clk based API helpers we reduce the code
duplication. The end goal is to get rid of all these macros when there
will be no more users of the clk based API, that is, when all the i.MX
clock provider drivers will be switched completely to the clk_hw based
API.

This is another step in moving away from the non clk_hw based API usage
throughout the i.MX clock drivers. The reason for doing that is to
have a clear split between the clock provider and the clock consumer API.
