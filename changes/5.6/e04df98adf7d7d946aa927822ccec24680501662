net: qrtr: Remove receive worker

Rather than enqueuing messages and scheduling a worker to deliver them
to the individual sockets we can now, thanks to the previous work, move
this directly into the endpoint callback.

This saves us a context switch per incoming message and removes the
possibility of an opportunistic suspend to happen between the message is
coming from the endpoint until it ends up in the socket's receive
buffer.
