KVM: x86: don't notify userspace IOAPIC on edge-triggered interrupt EOI

Commit 13db77347db1 ("KVM: x86: don't notify userspace IOAPIC on edge
EOI") said, edge-triggered interrupts don't set a bit in TMR, which means
that IOAPIC isn't notified on EOI. And var level indicates level-triggered
interrupt.
But commit 3159d36ad799 ("KVM: x86: use generic function for MSI parsing")
replace var level with irq.level by mistake. Fix it by changing irq.level
to irq.trig_mode.
