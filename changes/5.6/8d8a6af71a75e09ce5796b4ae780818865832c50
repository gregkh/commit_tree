drm/amd/display: Fix stereo with DCC enabled

[Why]
When sending DCC with Stereo, DCC gets enabled but the meta addresses
are 0. This happens momentarily before the meta addresses are populated
with a valid address.

[How]
Add call validate_dcc_with_meta_address() in
copy_surface_update_to_plane() to check for surface address and DCC
change.
When DCC has changed, check if DCC enable is true but meta address is 0.
If so, we turn DCC enable to false. When surface address has changed, we
check if DCC enable is false but meta address is not 0. If so, we turn
DCC enable back to true.  This will restore DCC enable to the proper
setting once the meta address is valid.
