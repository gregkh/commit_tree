selftests/vm: add missed tests in run_vmtests

The commits introducing 'mlock-random-test'[1], 'map_fiex_noreplace'[2],
and 'thuge-gen'[3] have not added those in the 'run_vmtests' script and
thus the 'run_tests' command of kselftests doesn't run those.  This
commit adds those in the script.

'gup_benchmark' and 'transhuge-stress' are also not included in the
'run_vmtests', but this commit does not add those because those are for
performance measurement rather than pass/fail tests.

[1] commit 26b4224d9961 ("selftests: expanding more mlock selftest")
[2] commit 91cbacc34512 ("tools/testing/selftests/vm/map_fixed_noreplace.c: add test for MAP_FIXED_NOREPLACE")
[3] commit fcc1f2d5dd34 ("selftests: add a test program for variable huge page sizes in mmap/shmget")
