fscrypt: move fscrypt_valid_enc_modes() to policy.c

fscrypt_valid_enc_modes() is only used by policy.c, so move it to there.

Also adjust the order of the checks to be more natural, matching the
numerical order of the constants and also keeping AES-256 (the
recommended default) first in the list.

No change in behavior.
