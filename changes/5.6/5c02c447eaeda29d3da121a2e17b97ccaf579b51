HID: hiddev: Fix race in in hiddev_disconnect()

Syzbot reports that "hiddev" is used after it's free in hiddev_disconnect().
The hiddev_disconnect() function sets "hiddev->exist = 0;" so
hiddev_release() can free it as soon as we drop the "existancelock"
lock.  This patch moves the mutex_unlock(&hiddev->existancelock) until
after we have finished using it.
