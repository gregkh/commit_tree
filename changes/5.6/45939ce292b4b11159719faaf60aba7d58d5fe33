ARM: 8957/1: VDSO: Match ARMv8 timer in cntvct_functional()

It is possible for a system with an ARMv8 timer to run a 32-bit kernel.
When this happens we will unconditionally have the vDSO code remove the
__vdso_gettimeofday and __vdso_clock_gettime symbols because
cntvct_functional() returns false since it does not match that
compatibility string.
