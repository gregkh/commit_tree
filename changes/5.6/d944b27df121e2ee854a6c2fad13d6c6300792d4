i2c: nvidia-gpu: Handle timeout correctly in gpu_i2c_check_status()

Nvidia card may come with a "phantom" UCSI device, and its driver gets
stuck in probe routine, prevents any system PM operations like suspend.

There's an unaccounted case that the target time can equal to jiffies in
gpu_i2c_check_status(), let's solve that by using readl_poll_timeout()
instead of jiffies comparison functions.
