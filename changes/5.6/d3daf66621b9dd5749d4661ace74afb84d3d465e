iommu/arm-smmu: Support SMMU module probing from the IORT

Add support for SMMU drivers built as modules to the ACPI/IORT device
probing path, by deferring the probe of the master if the SMMU driver is
known to exist but has not been loaded yet. Given that the IORT code
registers a platform device for each SMMU that it discovers, we can
easily trigger the udev based autoloading of the SMMU drivers by making
the platform device identifier part of the module alias.
