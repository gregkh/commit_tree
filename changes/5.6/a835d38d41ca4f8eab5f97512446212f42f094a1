tools/bpf/runqslower: Fix override option for VMLINUX_BTF

The runqslower tool refuses to build without a file to read vmlinux BTF
from. The build fails with an error message to override the location by
setting the VMLINUX_BTF variable if autodetection fails. However, the
Makefile doesn't actually work with that override - the error message is
still emitted.

Fix this by including the value of VMLINUX_BTF in the expansion, and only
emitting the error message if the *result* is empty. Also permit running
'make clean' even though no VMLINUX_BTF is set.
