PCI: Pass size + alignment to pci_bus_distribute_available_resources()

Change pci_bus_distribute_available_resources() arguments from
resource_size_t to struct resource to add more information required to get
the alignment correct for bridge windows with alignment >1M.

We require (size, alignment), instead of just (size) which is what is
currently available. The change from resource_size_t to struct resource
does just that.

Note that the struct resource arguments are passed by value and not by
reference. We do not want to pass by reference and change the resource size
of the parent bridge window. We only want the size information.

No functional change intended.
