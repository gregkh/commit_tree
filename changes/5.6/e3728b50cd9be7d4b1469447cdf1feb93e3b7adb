ACPI: PM: s2idle: Avoid possible race related to the EC GPE

It is theoretically possible for the ACPI EC GPE to be set after the
s2idle_ops->wake() called from s2idle_loop() has returned and before
the subsequent pm_wakeup_pending() check is carried out.  If that
happens, the resulting wakeup event will cause the system to resume
even though it may be a spurious one.

To avoid that race, first make the ->wake() callback in struct
platform_s2idle_ops return a bool value indicating whether or not
to let the system resume and rearrange s2idle_loop() to use that
value instad of the direct pm_wakeup_pending() call if ->wake() is
present.

Next, rework acpi_s2idle_wake() to process EC events and check
pm_wakeup_pending() before re-arming the SCI for system wakeup
to prevent it from triggering prematurely and add comments to
that function to explain the rationale for the new code flow.
