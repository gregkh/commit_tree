platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Fix indentation in several places

1. Put on one line PROPERTY_ENTRY_STRING("firmware-name", ...) lines. In most
   cases this doesn't over the limit, the rest is pretty much obvious from
   reading point of view.
2. Put on one line DMI_MATCH() parameters, we already have over the limit lines.
3. Reduce indentation of function parameters.
