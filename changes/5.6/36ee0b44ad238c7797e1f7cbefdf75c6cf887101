btrfs: Remove redundant WARN_ON in walk_down_log_tree

level <0 and level >= BTRFS_MAX_LEVEL are already performed upon
extent buffer read by tree checker in btrfs_check_node.
go. As far as 'level <= 0'  we are guaranteed that level is '> 0'
because the value of level _before_ reading 'next' is larger than 1
(otherwise we wouldn't have executed that code at all) this in turn
guarantees that 'level' after btrfs_read_buffer is 'level - 1' since
we verify this invariant in:

    btrfs_read_buffer
     btree_read_extent_buffer_pages
      btrfs_verify_level_key

This guarantees that level can never be '<= 0' so the warn on is
never triggered.
