compat_ioctl: scsi: handle HDIO commands from drivers

The ata_sas_scsi_ioctl() function implements a number of HDIO_* commands
for SCSI devices, it is used by all libata drivers as well as a few
drivers that support SAS attached SATA drives.

The only command that is not safe for compat ioctls here is
HDIO_GET_32BIT. Change the implementation to check for in_compat_syscall()
in order to do both cases correctly, and change all callers to use it
as both native and compat callback pointers, including the indirect
callers through sas_ioctl and ata_scsi_ioctl.
