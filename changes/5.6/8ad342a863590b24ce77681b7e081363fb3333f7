dmaengine: Add reference counting to dma_device struct

Adding a reference count helps drivers to properly implement the unbind
while in use case.

References are taken and put every time a channel is allocated or freed.

Once the final reference is put, the device is removed from the
dma_device_list and a release callback function is called to signal
the driver to free the memory.
