staging: wfx: drop wvif->setbssparams_done

setbssparams_done was here to ensure that the firmware does not enable
powersave before to get the first beacon. However, mac80211 already
ensures it gets a beacon before to associate to the BSS. And even, if
it won't, the firmware wake up at least on every DTIM, which is
sufficient to finalize the association.
