drm/amd/display: Disable secondary link for certain monitors

[why]
If the specific monitor supports DSC, the secondary link should be
disabled, and the other way around, too: if either that monitor or
our ASIC doesn't support DSC, the secodary link should be enabled.

[how]
Add a monitor patch and disable secondary link if that monitor
is detected and if ASIC supports DSC, or otherwise enable secondary
link.
