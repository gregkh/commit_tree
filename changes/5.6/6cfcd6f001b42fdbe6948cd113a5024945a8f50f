efi/x86: Re-disable RT services for 32-bit kernels running on 64-bit EFI

Commit a8147dba75b1 ("efi/x86: Rename efi_is_native() to efi_is_mixed()")
renamed and refactored efi_is_native() into efi_is_mixed(), but failed
to take into account that these are not diametrical opposites.

Mixed mode is a construct that permits 64-bit kernels to boot on 32-bit
firmware, but there is another non-native combination which is supported,
i.e., 32-bit kernels booting on 64-bit firmware, but only for boot and not
for runtime services. Also, mixed mode can be disabled in Kconfig, in
which case the 64-bit kernel can still be booted from 32-bit firmware,
but without access to runtime services.

Due to this oversight, efi_runtime_supported() now incorrectly returns
true for such configurations, resulting in crashes at boot. So fix this
by making efi_runtime_supported() aware of this.

As a side effect, some efi_thunk_xxx() stubs have become obsolete, so
remove them as well.
