pwm: mxs: Avoid a division in mxs_pwm_apply()

Since the divisor is not a compile-time constant (unless gcc somehow
decided to unroll the loop PERIOD_CDIV_MAX times), this does a
somewhat expensive 32/32 division. Replace that with a right shift.

We still have a 64/32 division just below, but at least in that
case the divisor is compile-time constant.
