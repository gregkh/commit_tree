drm/i915: ELiminate intel_pipe_to_cpu_transcoder() from assert_fdi_tx()

Let's start to eliminate intel_pipe_to_cpu_transcoder() so that
we can get rid of one more crtc->config usage (which we will want
to nuke as well).

In the case of assert_fdi_tx() we know that we're never
dealing with the EDP transcoder so we can simply replace
this with a cast.
