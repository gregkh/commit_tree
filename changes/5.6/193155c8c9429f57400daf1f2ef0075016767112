io_uring: handle multiple personalities in link chains

If we have a chain of requests and they don't all use the same
credentials, then the head of the chain will be issued with the
credentails of the tail of the chain.

Ensure __io_queue_sqe() overrides the credentials, if they are different.

Once we do that, we can clean up the creds handling as well, by only
having io_submit_sqe() do the lookup of a personality. It doesn't need
to assign it, since __io_queue_sqe() now always does the right thing.
