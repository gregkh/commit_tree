media: dt-bindings: media: sun4i-csi: Add compatible for CSI1 on A10/A20

The CSI1 block has the same structure and layout as the CSI0 block.
Differences include:

  - Only one channel in BT.656 instead of four in CSI0
  - 10-bit raw data input vs 8-bit in CSI0
  - 24-bit RGB888/YUV444 input vs 16-bit RGB565/YUV422 in CSI0
  - No ISP hardware

The hardware found in the A20 is the same as in the A10.
