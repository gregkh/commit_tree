futex: Fix inode life-time issue

As reported by Jann, ihold() does not in fact guarantee inode
persistence. And instead of making it so, replace the usage of inode
pointers with a per boot, machine wide, unique inode identifier.

This sequence number is global, but shared (file backed) futexes are
rare enough that this should not become a performance issue.
