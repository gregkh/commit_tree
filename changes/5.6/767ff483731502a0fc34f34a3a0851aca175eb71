net: Add a layer for non-PHY MII time stamping drivers.

While PHY time stamping drivers can simply attach their interface
directly to the PHY instance, stand alone drivers require support in
order to manage their services.  Non-PHY MII time stamping drivers
have a control interface over another bus like I2C, SPI, UART, or via
a memory mapped peripheral.  The controller device will be associated
with one or more time stamping channels, each of which sits snoops in
on a MII bus.

This patch provides a glue layer that will enable time stamping
channels to find their controlling device.
