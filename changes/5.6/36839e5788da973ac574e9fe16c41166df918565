drm/rockchip: lvds: Change platform data to hold helper_funcs pointer

Prepare the introduction of PX30 support by using
drm_encoder_helper_funcs as platform data instead of multiple register
names which are specific to rk3288 and not generic to all Rockchip
IPs. This way adding support for a new flavor of a similar IP will be
a matter of adding the relevant helper funcs.
