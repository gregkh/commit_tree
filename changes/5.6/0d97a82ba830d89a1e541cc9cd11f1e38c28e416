ipc/msg.c: update and document memory barriers

Transfer findings from ipc/mqueue.c:

- A control barrier was missing for the lockless receive case So in
  theory, not yet initialized data may have been copied to user space -
  obviously only for architectures where control barriers are not NOP.

- use smp_store_release().  In theory, the refount may have been
  decreased to 0 already when wake_q_add() tries to get a reference.
