power: supply: max17040: Config alert SOC low level threshold from FDT

For configuration of fuel gauge alert for a low level state of charge
interrupt we add a function to config level threshold and a device tree
binding property to set it in flatned device tree node.

Now we can use "maxim,alert-low-soc-level" property with the values from
1% up to 32% to configure alert interrupt threshold.
