netfilter: xt_hashlimit: reduce hashlimit_mutex scope for htable_put()

It is unnecessary to hold hashlimit_mutex for htable_destroy()
as it is already removed from the global hashtable and its
refcount is already zero.

Also, switch hinfo->use to refcount_t so that we don't have
to hold the mutex until it reaches zero in htable_put().
