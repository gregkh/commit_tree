crypto: rename sm3-256 to sm3 in hash_algo_name

The name sm3-256 is defined in hash_algo_name in hash_info, but the
algorithm name implemented in sm3_generic.c is sm3, which will cause
the sm3-256 algorithm to be not found in some application scenarios of
the hash algorithm, and an ENOENT error will occur. For example,
IMA, keys, and other subsystems that reference hash_algo_name all use
the hash algorithm of sm3.
