drm/i915: Unpin vma->obj on early error

If we inherit an error along the fence chain, we skip the main work
callback and go straight to the error. In the case of the vma bind
worker, we only dropped the pinned pages from the worker.

In the process, make sure we call the release earlier rather than wait
until the final reference to the fence is dropped (as a reference is
kept while being listened upon).
