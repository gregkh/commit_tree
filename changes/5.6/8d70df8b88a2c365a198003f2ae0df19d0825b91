soc: fsl: qe: remove unused #include of asm/irq.h from ucc.c

When allowing this driver to be built for ARM, the build fails (for
CONFIG_SMP=y) since ARM's asm/irq.h header is not self-contained:

  In file included from drivers/soc/fsl/qe/ucc.c:18:0:
>> arch/arm/include/asm/irq.h:34:50: error: unknown type name 'cpumask_t'
    extern void arch_trigger_cpumask_backtrace(const cpumask_t *mask,

But nothing in this file actually uses anything from asm/irq.h -
removing this #include generates identical object code, both on PPC32
and on ARM (the latter with a patch added to asm/irq.h to make the
build work in the first place).
