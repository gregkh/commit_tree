uio: fix a sleep-in-atomic-context bug in uio_dmem_genirq_irqcontrol()

The driver may sleep while holding a spinlock.
The function call path (from bottom to top) in Linux 4.19 is:

kernel/irq/manage.c, 523:
	synchronize_irq in disable_irq
drivers/uio/uio_dmem_genirq.c, 140:
	disable_irq in uio_dmem_genirq_irqcontrol
drivers/uio/uio_dmem_genirq.c, 134:
	_raw_spin_lock_irqsave in uio_dmem_genirq_irqcontrol

synchronize_irq() can sleep at runtime.

To fix this bug, disable_irq() is called without holding the spinlock.

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by myself.
