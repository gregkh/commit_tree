powerpc/powernv/ioda: Find opencapi slot for a device node

Unlike real PCI slots, opencapi slots are directly associated to
the (virtual) opencapi PHB, there's no intermediate bridge. So when
looking for a slot ID, we must start the search from the device node
itself and not its parent.

Also, the slot ID is not attached to a specific bdfn, so let's build
it from the PHB ID, like skiboot.
