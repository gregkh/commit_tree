xprtrdma: Eliminate per-transport "max pages"

To support device hotplug and migrating a connection between devices
of different capabilities, we have to guarantee that all in-kernel
devices can support the same max NFS payload size (1 megabyte).

This means that possibly one or two in-tree devices are no longer
supported for NFS/RDMA because they cannot support 1MB rsize/wsize.
The only one I confirmed was cxgb3, but it has already been removed
from the kernel.
