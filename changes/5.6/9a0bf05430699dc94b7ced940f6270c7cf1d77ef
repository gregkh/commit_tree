svm: Deactivate AVIC when launching guest with nested SVM support

Since AVIC does not currently work w/ nested virtualization,
deactivate AVIC for the guest if setting CPUID Fn80000001_ECX[SVM]
(i.e. indicate support for SVM, which is needed for nested virtualization).
Also, introduce a new APICV_INHIBIT_REASON_NESTED bit to be used for
this reason.
