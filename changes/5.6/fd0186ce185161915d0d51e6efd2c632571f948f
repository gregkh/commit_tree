drm/i915/bios: do not discard address space

When we map the VBT through pci_map_rom() we may not be allowed
to simply discard the address space and go on reading the memory.
That doesn't work on my test system, but by dumping the rom via
sysfs I can can get the correct vbt. So change our find_vbt() to do
the same as done by pci_read_rom(), i.e. use memcpy_fromio().

v2: the just the minimal changes by not bothering with the unaligned io
reads: this can be done on top (from Ville and Jani)

v3: drop const in function return since now we are copying the vbt,
rather than just finding it
