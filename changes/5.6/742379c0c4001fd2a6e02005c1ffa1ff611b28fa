drm/i915: Start chopping up the GPU error capture

In the near future, we will want to start a GPU error capture from a new
context, from inside the softirq region of a forced preemption. To do
so requires us to break up the monolithic error capture to provide new
entry points with finer control; in particular focusing on one
engine/gt, and being able to compose an error state from little pieces
of HW capture.
