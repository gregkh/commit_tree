spi: bcm63xx-hsspi: Really keep pll clk enabled

The purpose of commit 0fd85869c2a9 ("spi/bcm63xx-hsspi: keep pll clk enabled")
was to keep the pll clk enabled through the lifetime of the device.

In order to do that, some 'clk_prepare_enable()'/'clk_disable_unprepare()'
calls have been added in the error handling path of the probe function, in
the remove function and in the suspend and resume functions.

However, a 'clk_disable_unprepare()' call has been unfortunately left in
the probe function. So the commit seems to be more or less a no-op.

Axe it now, so that the pll clk is left enabled through the lifetime of
the device, as described in the commit.
