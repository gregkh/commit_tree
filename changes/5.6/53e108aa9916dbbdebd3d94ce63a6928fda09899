drm/amd/display: Handle hdcp2.2 type0/1 in dm

[Why]
HDCP 2.2 uses type0 and type1 content type. This is passed to the receiver
to stream the proper content.

For example, in a MST case if the main
device is HDCP2.2 capable but the secondary device is only 1.4 capabale
we can use Type0

Type0 content: use HDCP 1.4 or HDCP2.2 type0
Type1 content: Only use HDCP 2.2 type1

[How]
We use the "hdcp content type" property in drm. We use the
disable_type1 flag in hdcp module to select the type based on the
properties.

For updating the property we use the same logic as 1.4, but now we
consider content_type as well and update the property if the
requirements are met
