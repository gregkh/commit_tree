net: bridge: fix stale eth hdr pointer in br_dev_xmit

In br_dev_xmit() we perform vlan filtering in br_allowed_ingress() but
if the packet has the vlan header inside (e.g. bridge with disabled
tx-vlan-offload) then the vlan filtering code will use skb_vlan_untag()
to extract the vid before filtering which in turn calls pskb_may_pull()
and we may end up with a stale eth pointer. Moreover the cached eth header
pointer will generally be wrong after that operation. Remove the eth header
caching and just use eth_hdr() directly, the compiler does the right thing
and calculates it only once so we don't lose anything.
