dmaengine: imx-sdma: find desc first in sdma_tx_status

In sdma_tx_status() we must first find the current sdma_desc. In cyclic
mode we assume that this can always be found with vchan_find_desc().
This is true because do not remove the current descriptor from the
desc_issued list:

	/*
	 * Do not delete the node in desc_issued list in cyclic mode, otherwise
	 * the desc allocated will never be freed in vchan_dma_desc_free_list
	 */
	if (!(sdmac->flags & IMX_DMA_SG_LOOP))
		list_del(&vd->node);

We will change this in the next step, so check if the current descriptor is
the desired one also for the cyclic case.
