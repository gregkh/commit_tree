drm/amd/display: Lower DPP DTO only when safe

[Why]
A corner case currently exists where DPP DTO is lowered before
pipes are updated to a higher viewport. This causes underflow
as the DPPCLK is too low for the current viewport.

[How]
Only lower DPP DTO when it is safe to lower, or if
the newer clocks are higher than the current ones.
