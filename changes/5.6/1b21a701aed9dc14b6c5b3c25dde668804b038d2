mmc: sdhci-of-esdhc: fix clock setting for different controller versions

This patch is to fix clock setting code for different controller
versions. Two of HW changes after vendor version 2.2 are removing
PEREN/HCKEN/IPGEN bits in system control register, and adding SD
clock stable bit in present state register. This patch cleans up
related code too.
