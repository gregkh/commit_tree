arm64: alternative: fix build with clang integrated assembler

Building an arm64 defconfig with clang's integrated assembler, this error
occurs:
    <instantiation>:2:2: error: unrecognized instruction mnemonic
     _ASM_EXTABLE 9999b, 9f
     ^
    arch/arm64/mm/cache.S:50:1: note: while in macro instantiation
    user_alt 9f, "dc cvau, x4", "dc civac, x4", 0
    ^

While GNU as seems fine with case-sensitive macro instantiations, clang
doesn't, so use the actual macro name (_asm_extable) as in the rest of
the file.

Also checked that the generated assembly matches the GCC output.
