mac80211: fix wrong 160/80+80 MHz setting

Before this patch, STA's would set new width of 160/80+80 MHz based on AP capability only.
This is wrong because STA may not support > 80MHz BW.
Fix is to verify STA has 160/80+80 MHz capability before increasing its width to > 80MHz.

The "support_80_80" and "support_160" setting is based on:
"Table 9-272 â€” Setting of the Supported Channel Width Set subfield and Extended NSS BW
Support subfield at a STA transmitting the VHT Capabilities Information field"
From "Draft P802.11REVmd_D3.0.pdf"
