scsi: esp_scsi: Add support for FSC chip

The FSC (NCR53CF9x-2 / SYM53CF9x-2) has a different family code than QLogic
or Emulex parts. This caused it to be detected as a FAS100A.

Unforunately, this meant the configuration of the CONFIG3 register was
incorrect. This causes data transfer issues with FAST-SCSI targets.

The FSC also has the CONFIG4 register. It can be used to enable a feature
called Active Negation which should always be enabled according to the data
manual.
