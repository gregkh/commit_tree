vt: selection, close sel_buffer race

It is due to a race between parallel paste_selection (TIOCL_PASTESEL)
and set_selection_user (TIOCL_SETSEL) invocations. One uses sel_buffer,
while the other frees it and reallocates a new one for another
selection. Add a mutex to close this race.

The mutex takes care properly of sel_buffer and sel_buffer_lth only. The
other selection global variables (like sel_start, sel_end, and sel_cons)
are protected only in set_selection_user. The other functions need quite
some more work to close the races of the variables there. This is going
to happen later.

This likely fixes (I am unsure as there is no reproducer provided) bug
206361 too. It was marked as CVE-2020-8648.
