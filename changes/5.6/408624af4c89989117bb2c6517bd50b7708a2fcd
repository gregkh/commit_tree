vsock: use local transport when it is loaded

Now that we have a transport that can handle the local communication,
we can use it when it is loaded.

A socket will use the local transport (loopback) when the remote
CID is:
- equal to VMADDR_CID_LOCAL
- or equal to transport_g2h->get_local_cid(), if transport_g2h
  is loaded (this allows us to keep the same behavior implemented
  by virtio and vmci transports)
- or equal to VMADDR_CID_HOST, if transport_g2h is not loaded
