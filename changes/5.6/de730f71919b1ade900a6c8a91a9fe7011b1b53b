IB/hfi1: Move chip specific functions to chip.c

Move routines and defines associated with hdrq size validation to a chip
specific routine since the limits are specific to the device.

Fix incorrect value for min size 2 -> 32

CSR writes should also be in chip.c.

Create a chip routine to write the hdrq specific CSRs and call as
appropriate.
