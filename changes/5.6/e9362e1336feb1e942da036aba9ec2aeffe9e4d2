drm/i915/guc: kill doorbell code and selftests

Instead of relying on the workqueue, the upcoming reworked GuC
submission flow will offer the host driver indipendent control over
the execution status of each context submitted to GuC. As part of this,
the doorbell usage model has been reworked, with each doorbell being
paired to a single lrc and a doorbell ring representing new work
available for that specific context. This mechanism, however, limits
the number of contexts that can be registered with GuC to the number of
doorbells, which is an undesired limitation. To avoid this limitation,
we requested the GuC team to also provide a H2G that will allow the host
to notify the GuC of work available for a specified lrc, so we can use
that mechanism instead of relying on the doorbells. We can therefore drop
the doorbell code we currently have, also given the fact that in the
unlikely case we'd want to switch back to using doorbells we'd have to
heavily rework it.
The workqueue will still have a use in the new interface to pass special
commands, so that code has been retained for now.

With the doorbells gone and the GuC client becoming even simpler, the
existing GuC selftests don't give us any meaningful coverage so we can
remove them as well. Some selftests might come with the new code, but
they will look different from what we have now so if doesn't seem worth
it to keep the file around in the meantime.
