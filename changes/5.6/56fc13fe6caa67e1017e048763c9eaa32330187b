drm/amd/display: Don't spin forever waiting for DMCUB phy/auto init

[Why]
It's an interface violation to use infinite loops within DMUB
service functions and we'll lock up the kernel by doing so.

[How]
Revert the function back to its intended functionality.
Move the infinite loops into DC/DM as necessary.
