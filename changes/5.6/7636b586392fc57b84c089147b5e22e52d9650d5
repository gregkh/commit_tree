tools headers x86: Sync disabled-features.h

To silence the following tools/perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h arch/x86/include/asm/disabled-features.h

Picking up the changes in:

  45fc24e89b7c ("x86/mpx: remove MPX from arch/x86")

that didn't entail any functionality change in the tooling side.
