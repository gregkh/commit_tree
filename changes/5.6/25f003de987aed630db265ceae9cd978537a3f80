drivers/iommu: Take a ref to the IOMMU driver prior to ->add_device()

To avoid accidental removal of an active IOMMU driver module, take a
reference to the driver module in 'iommu_probe_device()' immediately
prior to invoking the '->add_device()' callback and hold it until the
after the device has been removed by '->remove_device()'.
