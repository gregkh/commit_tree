btrfs: qgroup: return ENOTCONN instead of EINVAL when quotas are not enabled

[PROBLEM]
qgroup create/remove code is currently returning EINVAL when the user
tries to create a qgroup on a subvolume without quota enabled. EINVAL is
already being used for too many error scenarios so that is hard to
depict what is the problem.

[FIX]
Currently scrub and balance code return -ENOTCONN when the user tries to
cancel/pause and no scrub or balance is currently running for the
desired subvolume. Do the same here by returning -ENOTCONN  when a user
tries to create/delete/assing/list a qgroup on a subvolume without quota
enabled.
