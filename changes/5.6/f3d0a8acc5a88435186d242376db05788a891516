scsi: lpfc: Fix missing check for CSF in Write Object Mbox Rsp

When the WriteObject mailbox response has change_status set to is 0x2
(Firmware Reset) or 0x04 (Port Migration Reset), the CSF field should also
be checked to see if a fw reset is sufficient to enable all new features in
the updated firmware image. If not, a fw reset would start the new
firmware, but with a feature level equal to existing firmware.  To enable
the new features, a chip reset/pci slot reset would be required.

Check the CSF bit when change_status is 0x2 or 0x4 to know whether to
perform a pci bus reset or fw reset.
