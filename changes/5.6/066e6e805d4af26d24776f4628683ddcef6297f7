i2c: pmcmsp: Use proper printk format for resource_size_t

resource_size_t should be printed with its own size-independent format
to fix warnings when compiling on 64-bit platform (e.g. with
COMPILE_TEST):

    drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-pmcmsp.c: In function ‘pmcmsptwi_probe’:
    drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-pmcmsp.c:276:25: warning:
        format ‘%x’ expects argument of type ‘unsigned int’,
        but argument 3 has type ‘resource_size_t {aka long long unsigned int}’ [-Wformat=]
