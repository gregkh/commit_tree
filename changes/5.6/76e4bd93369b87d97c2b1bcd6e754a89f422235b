powerpc/configs: Drop CONFIG_QLGE which moved to staging

The QLGE driver moved to staging in commit 955315b0dc8c ("qlge: Move
drivers/net/ethernet/qlogic/qlge/ to drivers/staging/qlge/"), meaning
our defconfigs that enable it have no effect as we don't enable
CONFIG_STAGING.

It sounds like the device is obsolete, so drop the driver.
