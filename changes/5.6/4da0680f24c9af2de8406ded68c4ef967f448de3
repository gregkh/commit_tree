soundwire: intel: add mutex for shared SHIM register access

Some of the Intel SoundWire SHIM registers contain fields for
different links. Without protection, the master drivers for the
different links will access these shared registers, leading to invalid
configurations and timeouts (specifically when changing CPA/SPA
power-related registers and polling for the changes to be applied).

A mutex is added to make sure all rmw access to those registers are
serialized.
