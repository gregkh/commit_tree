Input: edt-ft5x06 - document wakeup-source capability

The current driver behaviour was to enable the wakeup-source everytime.
After discussion [1] we decided to change that behaviour so the device
will act as wakeup-source only if the "wakeup-source" dt-property is
present.

The patch adds the binding documentation to enable the wakeup-source
capability.
