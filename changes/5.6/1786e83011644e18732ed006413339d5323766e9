efi/libstub: Extend native protocol definitions with mixed_mode aliases

In preparation of moving to a native vs. mixed mode split rather than a
32 vs. 64 bit split when it comes to invoking EFI firmware services,
update all the native protocol definitions and redefine them as unions
containing an anonymous struct for the native view and a struct called
'mixed_mode' describing the 32-bit view of the protocol when called from
64-bit code.

While at it, flesh out some PCI I/O member definitions that we will be
needing shortly.
