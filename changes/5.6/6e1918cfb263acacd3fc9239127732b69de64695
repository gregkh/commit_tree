fscrypt: don't allow v1 policies with casefolding

Casefolded encrypted directories will use a new dirhash method that
requires a secret key.  If the directory uses a v2 encryption policy,
it's easy to derive this key from the master key using HKDF.  However,
v1 encryption policies don't provide a way to derive additional keys.

Therefore, don't allow casefolding on directories that use a v1 policy.
Specifically, make it so that trying to enable casefolding on a
directory that has a v1 policy fails, trying to set a v1 policy on a
casefolded directory fails, and trying to open a casefolded directory
that has a v1 policy (if one somehow exists on-disk) fails.
