ata: brcm: fix reset controller API usage

While fixing another issue in this driver I noticed it uses
IS_ERR_OR_NULL(), which is almost always a mistake.

Change the driver to use the proper devm_reset_control_get_optional()
interface instead and remove the checks except for the one that
checks for a failure in that function.
