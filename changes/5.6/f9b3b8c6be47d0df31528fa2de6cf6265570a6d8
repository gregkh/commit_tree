drm/i915/bios: remove extra debug messages

Just like in commit 523e0cc89b83 ("drm/i915/tgl: allow DVI/HDMI on port
A"), the port checks when reading the VBT can easily not match what the
platform really exposes. However here we only have some additional debug
messages that are not adding much value: in the previous debug message
we already print everything we know about the VBT.

Instead of keep fixing the possible port assignments according to the
platform, just nuke the additional messages.
