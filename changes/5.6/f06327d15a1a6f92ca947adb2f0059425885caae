sysrq: Remove sysrq_handler_registered

sysrq_toggle_support() can be called in parallel, in return calling
input_(un)register_handler(), which fortunately is safe to call
in parallel and regardless of registered/unregistered status of
sysrq_handler.
Remove sysrq_handler_registered as it doesn't have any function there
and may confuse reader about possible race.
