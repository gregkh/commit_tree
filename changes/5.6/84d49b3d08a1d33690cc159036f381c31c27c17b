mmc: sdhci-acpi: Switch signal voltage back to 3.3V on suspend on external microSD on Lenovo Miix 320

Based on a sample of 7 DSDTs from Cherry Trail devices using an AXP288
PMIC depending on the design one of 2 possible LDOs on the PMIC is used
for the MMC signalling voltage, either DLDO3 or GPIO1LDO (GPIO1 pin in
low noise LDO mode).

The Lenovo Miix 320-10ICR uses GPIO1LDO in the SHC1 ACPI device's DSM
methods to set 3.3 or 1.8 signalling voltage and this appears to work
as advertised, so presumably the device is actually using GPIO1LDO for
the external microSD signalling voltage.

But this device has a bug in the _PS0 method of the SHC1 ACPI device,
the DSM remembers the last set signalling voltage and the _PS0 restores
this after a (runtime) suspend-resume cycle, but it "restores" the voltage
on DLDO3 instead of setting it on GPIO1LDO as the DSM method does. DLDO3
is used for the LCD and setting it to 1.8V causes the LCD to go black.

This commit works around this issue by calling the Intel DSM to reset the
signal voltage to 3.3V after the host has been runtime suspended.
This will make the _PS0 method reprogram the DLDO3 voltage to 3.3V, which
leaves it at its original setting fixing the LCD going black.

This commit adds and uses a DMI quirk mechanism to only trigger this
workaround on the Lenovo Miix 320 while leaving the behavior of the
driver unchanged on other devices.
