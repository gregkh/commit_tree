mmc: sdhci-cadence: set SDHCI_QUIRK2_PRESET_VALUE_BROKEN for UniPhier

The SDHCI_PRESET_FOR_* registers are not set for the UniPhier platform
integration. (They are all read as zeros).

Set the SDHCI_QUIRK2_PRESET_VALUE_BROKEN quirk flag. Otherwise, the
High Speed DDR mode on the eMMC controller (MMC_TIMING_MMC_DDR52)
would not work.

I split the platform data to give no impact to other platforms,
although the UniPhier platform is currently only the upstream user
of this IP.

The SDHCI_QUIRK2_PRESET_VALUE_BROKEN flag is set if the compatible
string matches to "socionext,uniphier-sd4hc".
