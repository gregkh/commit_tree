scsi: qla2xxx: Remove defer flag to indicate immeadiate port loss

During cable pull test case, if the port is disconnected for time larger
than devloss timeout, driver does not mark path offline.  In such case,
instead of notifying SCSI-ML of loop down, driver goes into endless loop of
device relogin because defer flag is set.

With newer handling of device relogin in driver discovery, defer flag is
now redundant. This patch removes defer flag and cleans up code handling
port lost indication to SCSI-ML.
