perf stat: Don't report a null stalled cycles per insn metric

For data collected on machines with front end stalled cycles supported,
such as found on modern AMD CPU families, commit 146540fb545b ("perf
stat: Always separate stalled cycles per insn") introduces a new line in
CSV output with a leading comma that upsets some automated scripts.
Scripts have to use "-e ex_ret_instr" to work around this issue, after
upgrading to a version of perf with that commit.

We could add "if (have_frontend_stalled && !config->csv_sep)" to the not
(total && avg) else clause, to emphasize that CSV users are usually
scripts, and are written to do only what is needed, i.e., they wouldn't
typically invoke "perf stat" without specifying an explicit event list.

But - let alone CSV output - why should users now tolerate a constant
0-reporting extra line in regular terminal output?:

BEFORE:

$ sudo perf stat --all-cpus -einstructions,cycles -- sleep 1

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

       181,110,981      instructions              #    0.58  insn per cycle
                                                  #    0.00  stalled cycles per insn
       309,876,469      cycles

       1.002202582 seconds time elapsed

The user would not like to see the now permanent:

  "0.00  stalled cycles per insn"

line fixture, as it gives no useful information.

So this patch removes the printing of the zeroed stalled cycles line
altogether, almost reverting the very original commit fb4605ba47e7
("perf stat: Check for frontend stalled for metrics"), which seems like
it was written to normalize --metric-only column output of common Intel
machines at the time: modern Intel machines have ceased to support the
genericised frontend stalled metrics AFAICT.

AFTER:

$ sudo perf stat --all-cpus -einstructions,cycles -- sleep 1

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

       244,071,432      instructions              #    0.69  insn per cycle
       355,353,490      cycles

       1.001862516 seconds time elapsed

Output behaviour when stalled cycles is indeed measured is not affected
(BEFORE == AFTER):

$ sudo perf stat --all-cpus -einstructions,cycles,stalled-cycles-frontend -- sleep 1

 Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

       247,227,799      instructions              #    0.63  insn per cycle
                                                  #    0.26  stalled cycles per insn
       394,745,636      cycles
        63,194,485      stalled-cycles-frontend   #   16.01% frontend cycles idle

       1.002079770 seconds time elapsed
