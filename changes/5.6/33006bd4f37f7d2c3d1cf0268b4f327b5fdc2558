IB/core: Introduce ib_reg_user_mr

Add ib_reg_user_mr() for kernel ULPs to register user MRs.

The common use case that uses this function is a userspace application
that allocates memory for HCA access but the responsibility to register
the memory at the HCA is on an kernel ULP. This ULP that acts as an agent
for the userspace application.

This function is intended to be used without a user context so vendor
drivers need to be aware of calling reg_user_mr() device operation with
udata equal to NULL.

Among all drivers, i40iw is the only driver which relies on presence
of udata, so check udata existence for that driver.
