net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: fix lockup on warm boot

If the switch is not hardware reset on a warm boot, interrupts can be
left enabled, and possibly pending. This will cause us to enter an
infinite loop trying to service an interrupt we are unable to handle,
thereby preventing the kernel from booting.

Ensure that the global 2 interrupt sources are disabled before we claim
the parent interrupt.

Observed on the ZII development revision B and C platforms with
reworked serdes support, and using reboot -f to reboot the platform.
