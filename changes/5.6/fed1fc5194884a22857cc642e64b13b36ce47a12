ARM: dts: rockchip: rename dwmmc node names to mmc

Current dts files with 'dwmmc' nodes are manually verified.
In order to automate this process rockchip-dw-mshc.txt
has to be converted to yaml. In the new setup
rockchip-dw-mshc.yaml will inherit properties from
mmc-controller.yaml and synopsys-dw-mshc-common.yaml.
'dwmmc' will no longer be a valid name for a node,
so change them all to 'mmc'
