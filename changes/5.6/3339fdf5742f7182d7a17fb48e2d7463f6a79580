drm/ast: Store primary-plane format in struct ast_crtc_state

Reading the primary plane's framebuffer from the CRTC's atomic_flush()
function is fragile as the plane state or framebuffer can be NULL.
Instead, we let the plane's atomic_check() store the framebuffer format
in the CRTC state. The CRTC always receives the framebuffer format that
is currently programmed, or NULL if no mode has been set yet.
