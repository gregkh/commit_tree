kexec: quiet down kexec reboot

Here is a regular kexec command sequence and output:
=====
$ kexec --reuse-cmdline -i --load Image
$ kexec -e
[  161.342002] kexec_core: Starting new kernel

Welcome to Buildroot
buildroot login:
=====

Even when "quiet" kernel parameter is specified, "kexec_core: Starting
new kernel" is printed.

This message has  KERN_EMERG level, but there is no emergency, it is a
normal kexec operation, so quiet it down to appropriate KERN_NOTICE.

Machines that have slow console baud rate benefit from less output.
