media: sun4i-csi: Fix [HV]sync polarity handling

The Allwinner camera sensor interface has a different definition of
[HV]sync. While the timing diagram uses the names HSYNC and VSYNC,
the note following the diagram and register names use HREF and VREF.
Combined they imply the hardware uses either [HV]REF or inverted
[HV]SYNC. There are also registers to set horizontal skip lengths
in pixels and vertical skip lengths in lines, also known as back
porches.

Fix the polarity handling by using the opposite polarity flag for
the checks. Also rename `[hv]sync_pol` to `[hv]ref_pol` to better
match the hardware register description.
