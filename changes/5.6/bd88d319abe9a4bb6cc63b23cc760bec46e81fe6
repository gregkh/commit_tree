pwm: imx27: Unconditionally write state to hardware

The i.MX driver currently uses a shortcut and doesn't write all of the
state through to the hardware when the PWM is disabled. This causes an
inconsistent state to be read back by consumers with the result of them
malfunctioning.

Fix this by always writing the full state through to the hardware
registers so that the correct state can always be read back.
