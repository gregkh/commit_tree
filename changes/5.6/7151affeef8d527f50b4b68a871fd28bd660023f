net: export netdev_next_lower_dev_rcu()

netdev_next_lower_dev_rcu() will be used to implement a function,
which is to walk all lower interfaces.
There are already functions that they walk their lower interface.
(netdev_walk_all_lower_dev_rcu, netdev_walk_all_lower_dev()).
But, there would be cases that couldn't be covered by given
netdev_walk_all_lower_dev_{rcu}() function.
So, some modules would want to implement own function,
which is to walk all lower interfaces.

In the next patch, netdev_next_lower_dev_rcu() will be used.
In addition, this patch removes two unused prototypes in netdevice.h.
