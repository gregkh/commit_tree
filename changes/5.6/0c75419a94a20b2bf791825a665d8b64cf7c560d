ASoC: SOF: Intel: do not disable i915 power during probe

Change HDA probe behaviour slightly so that i915 power is not
turned off if i915 audio codecs are found in the initial probe done
by SOF Intel driver, and power is kept on until HDA codec driver
probe runs.

This will reduce number of mode sets on platforms with low
minimum CDCLK (like GLK) and brings the SOF probe sequence closer
to legacy HDA driver in terms of i915 audio codec power management.
