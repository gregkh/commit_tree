net: mvneta: fix XDP support if sw bm is used as fallback

In order to fix XDP support if sw buffer management is used as fallback
for hw bm devices, define MVNETA_SKB_HEADROOM as maximum between
XDP_PACKET_HEADROOM and NET_SKB_PAD and let the hw aligns the IP header
to 4-byte boundary.
Fix rx_offset_correction initialization if mvneta_bm_port_init fails in
mvneta_resume routine
