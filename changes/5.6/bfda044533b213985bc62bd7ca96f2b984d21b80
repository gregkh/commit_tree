spi: dw: use "smp_mb()" to avoid sending spi data error

Because of out-of-order execution about some CPU architecture,
In this debug stage we find Completing spi interrupt enable ->
prodrucing TXEI interrupt -> running "interrupt_transfer" function
will prior to set "dw->rx and dws->rx_end" data, so this patch add
memory barrier to enable dw->rx and dw->rx_end to be visible and
solve to send SPI data error.
eg:
it will fix to this following low possibility error in testing environment
which using SPI control to connect TPM Modules

kernel: tpm tpm0: Operation Timed out
kernel: tpm tpm0: tpm_relinquish_locality: : error -1
