net: bcmgenet: use CHECKSUM_COMPLETE for NETIF_F_RXCSUM

This commit updates the Rx checksum offload behavior of the driver
to use the more generic CHECKSUM_COMPLETE method that supports all
protocols over the CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY method that only applies
to some protocols known by the hardware.

This behavior is perceived to be superior.
