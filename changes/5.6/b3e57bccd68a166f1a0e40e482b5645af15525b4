drm/i915/tgl: Gen-12 render decompression

Gen-12 display decompression operates on Y-tiled compressed main surface.
The CCS is linear and has 4 bits of metadata for each main surface cache
line pair, a size ratio of 1:256. Gen-12 display decompression is
incompatible with buffers compressed by earlier GPUs, so make use of a new
modifier to identify gen-12 compression. Another notable change is that
render decompression is supported on all planes except cursor and on all
pipes. Start by adding render decompression support for [A,X]BGR888 pixel
formats.

v2: Fix checkpatch warnings (Lucas)
v3:
Rebase, disable color clear, styling changes and modify
intel_tile_width_bytes and intel_tile_height to handle linear CCS
v4:
- Use format block descriptors and the i915 specific func to get the
  subsampling for each color plane.
- Use helpers to convert between CCS and main planes.
v5:
- Fix subsampling returned by intel_fb_plane_get_subsampling() for
  the CCS plane of the first plane.
v6:
- Rebased on v2 of patch 4.
v7:
- Fix plane dimensions during FB check.
