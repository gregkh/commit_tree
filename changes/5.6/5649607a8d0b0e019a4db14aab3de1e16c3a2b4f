powerpc/papr_scm: Fix leaking 'bus_desc.provider_name' in some paths

String 'bus_desc.provider_name' allocated inside
papr_scm_nvdimm_init() will leaks in case call to
nvdimm_bus_register() fails or when papr_scm_remove() is called.

This minor patch ensures that 'bus_desc.provider_name' is freed in
error path for nvdimm_bus_register() as well as in papr_scm_remove().
