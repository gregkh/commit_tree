ASoC: SOF: Intel: drop HDA codec upon probe failure

In case a HDA codec probe fails, do not raise error immediately,
but instead remove the codec from bus->codec_mask and continue
probe for other codecs.

This allows for more robust behaviour in cases where one codec
in the system is faulty. SOF driver load can still proceed with
the codecs that can be probed successfully. Probe may still
fail if suitable machine driver is not found, but in many
cases the generic HDA machine driver can operate with a subset
of codecs.
