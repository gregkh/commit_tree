r8169: fix performance regression related to PCIe max read request size

It turned out that on low performance systems the original change can
cause lower tx performance. On a N3450-based mini-PC tx performance
in iperf3 was reduced from 950Mbps to ~900Mbps. Therefore effectively
revert the original change, just use pcie_set_readrq() now instead of
changing the PCIe capability register directly.
