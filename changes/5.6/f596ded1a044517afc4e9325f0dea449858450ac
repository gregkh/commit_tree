init/main.c: fix misleading "This architecture does not have kernel memory protection" message

This message leads to thinking that memory protection is not implemented
for the said architecture, whereas absence of CONFIG_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX
only means that memory protection has not been selected at compile time.

Don't print this message when CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_STRICT_KERNEL_RWX is
selected by the architecture.  Instead, print "Kernel memory protection
not selected by kernel config."
