iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Rationalise VTCR handling

Commit 05a648cd2dd7 ("iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Rationalise TCR handling")
reworked the way in which the TCR register value is returned from the
io-pgtable code when targetting the Arm long-descriptor format, in
preparation for allowing page-tables to target TTBR1.

As it turns out, the new interface is a lot nicer to use, so do the same
conversion for the VTCR register even though there is only a single base
register for stage-2 translation.
