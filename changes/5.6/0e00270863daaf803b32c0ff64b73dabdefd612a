iwlwifi: pcie: validate queue ID before array deref/bit ops

Validate that the queue ID is in range before trying to use it as
an index or for test_bit() - the previous bug showed that this has
in fact happened, and it was lucky that we caught it there, had the
bit been set then we'd have actually used the value despite being
far out of range.
