drm/i915/gem: Take timeline->mutex to walk list-of-requests

Though the context is closed and so no more requests can be added to the
timeline, retirement can still be removing requests. It can even be
removing the very request we are inspecting and so cause us to wander
into dead links.

Serialise with the retirement by taking the timeline->mutex used for
guarding the timeline->requests list.
