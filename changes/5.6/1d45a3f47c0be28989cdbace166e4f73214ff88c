mmc: sdhci-cadence: remove unneeded 'inline' marker

'static inline' in .c files does not make much sense because
functions may or may not be inlined irrespective of the 'inline'
marker. It is just a hint.

This function is quite small, so very likely to be inlined by the
compiler's optimization (-O2 or -Os), but it is up to the compiler
after all.
