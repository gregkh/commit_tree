ASoC: fsl_asrc: Add support for imx8qm & imx8qxp

There are two asrc module in imx8qm & imx8qxp, each module has
different clock configuration, and the DMA type is EDMA.

So in this patch, we define the new clocks, refine the clock map,
and include struct fsl_asrc_soc_data for different soc usage.

The EDMA channel is fixed with each dma request, one dma request
corresponding to one dma channel. So we need to request dma
channel with dma request of asrc module.
