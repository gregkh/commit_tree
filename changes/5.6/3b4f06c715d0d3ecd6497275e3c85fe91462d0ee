sfc: complete the next packet when we receive a timestamp

We now ignore the "completion" event when using tx queue timestamping,
and only pay attention to the two (high and low) timestamp events. The
NIC will send a pair of timestamp events for every packet transmitted.
The current firmware may merge the completion events, and it is possible
that future versions may reorder the completion and timestamp events.
As such the completion event is not useful.

Without this patch in place a merged completion event on a queue with
timestamping will cause a "spurious TX completion" error. This affects
SFN8000-series adapters.
