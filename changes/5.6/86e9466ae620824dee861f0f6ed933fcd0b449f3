intel_idle: Clean up irtl_2_usec()

Move the irtl_ns_units[] definition into irtl_2_usec() which is the
only user of it, use div_u64() for the division in there (as the
divisor is small enough) and use the NSEC_PER_USEC symbol for the
divisor.  Also convert the irtl_2_usec() comment to a proper
kerneldo one.

No intentional functional impact.
