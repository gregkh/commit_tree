pwm: rcar: Drop useless call to pwm_get_state()

pwm_get_state has no side effects and the resulting pwm_state is unused.
So drop the call to pwm_get_state() and the local variable from
rcar_pwm_apply().

The call was introduced in commit 7f68ce8287d3 ("pwm: rcar: Add support
"atomic" API") and already then was useless.
