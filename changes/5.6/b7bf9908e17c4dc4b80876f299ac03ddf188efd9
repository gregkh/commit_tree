ovl: fix corner case of non-constant st_dev;st_ino

On non-samefs overlay without xino, non pure upper inodes should use a
pseudo_dev assigned to each unique lower fs, but if lower layer is on the
same fs and upper layer, it has no pseudo_dev assigned.

In this overlay layers setup:
 - two filesystems, A and B
 - upper layer is on A
 - lower layer 1 is also on A
 - lower layer 2 is on B

Non pure upper overlay inode, whose origin is in layer 1 will have the
st_dev;st_ino values of the real lower inode before copy up and the
st_dev;st_ino values of the real upper inode after copy up.

Fix this inconsitency by assigning a unique pseudo_dev also for upper fs,
that will be used as st_dev value along with the lower inode st_dev for
overlay inodes in the case above.
