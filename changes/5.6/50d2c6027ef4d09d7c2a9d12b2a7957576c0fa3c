drm/amd/display: Do not send training pattern if VS Different

[Why]
The DP 1.4a Spec requires that training pattern only under certain
specific conditions. Currently driver will re-send
training pattern every time voltage swing value changes,
but that should not be the case.

[How]
Do not re-send training pattern every time VS values
are different. Only send it on the first iteration.
