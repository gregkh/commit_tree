drm/i915/display/icl+: Do not program clockgating

Talked with HW team and this is a left over, driver should not
program clockgating, mg or dekel firmware is reponsible for any
clockgating programing.

Also removing the register and bits definition related to clockgating.

v2:
Added WARN_ON

v3:
Only calling icl_phy_set_clock_gating() on intel_ddi_pre_enable_hdmi
for GEN11

v4:
ICL should also not program clockgating (thanks Matt for catching
this)
