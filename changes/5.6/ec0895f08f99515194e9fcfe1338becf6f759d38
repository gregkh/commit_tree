powerpc/vdso32: inline __get_datapage()

__get_datapage() is only a few instructions to retrieve the
address of the page where the kernel stores data to the VDSO.

By inlining this function into its users, a bl/blr pair and
a mflr/mtlr pair is avoided, plus a few reg moves.

The improvement is noticeable (about 55 nsec/call on an 8xx)

vdsotest before the patch:
gettimeofday:    vdso: 731 nsec/call
clock-gettime-realtime-coarse:    vdso: 668 nsec/call
clock-gettime-monotonic-coarse:    vdso: 745 nsec/call

vdsotest after the patch:
gettimeofday:    vdso: 677 nsec/call
clock-gettime-realtime-coarse:    vdso: 613 nsec/call
clock-gettime-monotonic-coarse:    vdso: 690 nsec/call
