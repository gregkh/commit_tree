enic: prevent waking up stopped tx queues over watchdog reset

Recent months, our customer reported several kernel crashes all
preceding with following message:
NETDEV WATCHDOG: eth2 (enic): transmit queue 0 timed out
Error message of one of those crashes:
BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffffa007e090

After analyzing severl vmcores, I found that most of crashes are
caused by memory corruption. And all the corrupted memory areas
are overwritten by data of network packets. Moreover, I also found
that the tx queues were enabled over watchdog reset.

After going through the source code, I found that in enic_stop(),
the tx queues stopped by netif_tx_disable() could be woken up over
a small time window between netif_tx_disable() and the
napi_disable() by the following code path:
napi_poll->
  enic_poll_msix_wq->
     vnic_cq_service->
        enic_wq_service->
           netif_wake_subqueue(enic->netdev, q_number)->
              test_and_clear_bit(__QUEUE_STATE_DRV_XOFF, &txq->state)
In turn, upper netowrk stack could queue skb to ENIC NIC though
enic_hard_start_xmit(). And this might introduce some race condition.

Our customer comfirmed that this kind of kernel crash doesn't occur over
90 days since they applied this patch.
