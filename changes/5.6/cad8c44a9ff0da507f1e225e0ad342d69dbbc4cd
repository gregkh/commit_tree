dt-bindings: display: bridge: lvds-codec: Absorb thine, thc63lvdm83d.txt

At this point in time, compatible string "thine,thc63lvdm83d" is
backed by the lvds-codec driver, and the documentation contained
in thine,thc63lvdm83d.txt is basically the same as the one
contained in lvds-codec.yaml (generic fallback compatible string
aside), therefore absorb thine,thc63lvdm83d.txt.
