s390/qeth: cancel RX reclaim work earlier

When qeth's napi poll code fails to refill an entirely empty RX ring, it
kicks off buffer_reclaim_work to try again later.

Make sure that this worker is cancelled when setting the qeth device
offline. Otherwise a RX refill action can unexpectedly end up running
concurrently to bigger re-configurations (eg. resizing the buffer pool),
without any locking.
