clocksource/drivers/bcm2835_timer: Fix memory leak of timer

Currently when setup_irq fails the error exit path will leak the
recently allocated timer structure.  Originally the code would
throw a panic but a later commit changed the behaviour to return
via the err_iounmap path and hence we now have a memory leak. Fix
this by adding a err_timer_free error path that kfree's timer.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Resource Leak")
