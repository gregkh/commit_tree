xdp: Use bulking for non-map XDP_REDIRECT and consolidate code paths

Since the bulk queue used by XDP_REDIRECT now lives in struct net_device,
we can re-use the bulking for the non-map version of the bpf_redirect()
helper. This is a simple matter of having xdp_do_redirect_slow() queue the
frame on the bulk queue instead of sending it out with __bpf_tx_xdp().

Unfortunately we can't make the bpf_redirect() helper return an error if
the ifindex doesn't exit (as bpf_redirect_map() does), because we don't
have a reference to the network namespace of the ingress device at the time
the helper is called. So we have to leave it as-is and keep the device
lookup in xdp_do_redirect_slow().

Since this leaves less reason to have the non-map redirect code in a
separate function, so we get rid of the xdp_do_redirect_slow() function
entirely. This does lose us the tracepoint disambiguation, but fortunately
the xdp_redirect and xdp_redirect_map tracepoints use the same tracepoint
entry structures. This means both can contain a map index, so we can just
amend the tracepoint definitions so we always emit the xdp_redirect(_err)
tracepoints, but with the map ID only populated if a map is present. This
means we retire the xdp_redirect_map(_err) tracepoints entirely, but keep
the definitions around in case someone is still listening for them.

With this change, the performance of the xdp_redirect sample program goes
from 5Mpps to 8.4Mpps (a 68% increase).

Since the flush functions are no longer map-specific, rename the flush()
functions to drop _map from their names. One of the renamed functions is
the xdp_do_flush_map() callback used in all the xdp-enabled drivers. To
keep from having to update all drivers, use a #define to keep the old name
working, and only update the virtual drivers in this patch.
