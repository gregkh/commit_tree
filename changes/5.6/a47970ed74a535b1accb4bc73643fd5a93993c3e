kvm/svm: PKU not currently supported

Current SVM implementation does not have support for handling PKU. Guests
running on a host with future AMD cpus that support the feature will read
garbage from the PKRU register and will hit segmentation faults on boot as
memory is getting marked as protected that should not be. Ensure that cpuid
from SVM does not advertise the feature.
