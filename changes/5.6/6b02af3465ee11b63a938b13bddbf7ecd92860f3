usb: gadget: f_uac2: fix packet size calculation

The packet size for USB audio must always be a multiple of the frame
size, otherwise we are transmitting a partial frame which omits some
channels (and these end up at the wrong offset in the next packet).
Furthermore, it breaks the residue handling such that we end up trying
to send a packet exceeding the maximum packet size for the endpoint.
