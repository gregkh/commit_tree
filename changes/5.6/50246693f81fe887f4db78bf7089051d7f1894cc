bcache: rework error unwinding in register_bcache

Split the successful and error return path, and use one goto label for each
resource to unwind.  This also fixes some small errors like leaking the
module reference count in the reboot case (which seems entirely harmless)
or printing the wrong warning messages for early failures.
