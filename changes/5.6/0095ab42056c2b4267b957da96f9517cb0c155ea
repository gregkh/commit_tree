vt: Correct comment documenting do_take_over_console()

Commit 3e795de7631b ("[PATCH] VT binding: Add binding/unbinding support
for the VT console") introduced a code comment claiming that
"do_take_over_console is basically a register followed by unbind".

However the function actually performs a register followed by *bind*.
