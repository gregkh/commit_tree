drm/i915/bios: assume vbt is 4-byte aligned into oprom

The unaligned ioread32() will make us read byte by byte looking for the
vbt. We could just as well have done a ioread8() + a shift and avoid the
extra confusion on how we are looking for "$VBT".

However when using ACPI it's guaranteed the VBT is 4-byte aligned
per spec, so we can probably assume it here as well.

v2: do not try to simplify the loop by eliminating the auxiliary counter
(Jani and Ville)
