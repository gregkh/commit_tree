futex: Unbreak futex hashing

The recent futex inode life time fix changed the ordering of the futex key
union struct members, but forgot to adjust the hash function accordingly,

As a result the hashing omits the leading 64bit and even hashes beyond the
futex key causing a bad hash distribution which led to a ~100% performance
regression.

Hand in the futex key pointer instead of a random struct member and make
the size calculation based of the struct offset.
