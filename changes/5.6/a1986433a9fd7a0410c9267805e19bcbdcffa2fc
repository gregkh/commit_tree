without changing the underlying content.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Changes in v3:
Removed unnecessary markup.
Removed section "BUG REPORTS" as recommended by the maintainer.

Changes in v2:
Refactored long lines as pointed out by Jonathan
Copied the maintainer
Updated the reference in the MAINTAINERS file for vfat

I did not move this into admin-guide, waiting on what the
maintainer has to say about this and also about old sections
in the text, if any.
