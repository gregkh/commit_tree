irqchip/gic-v4.1: Implement the v4.1 flavour of VMOVP

With GICv4.1, VMOVP is extended to allow a default doorbell to be
specified, as well as a validity bit for this doorbell. As an added
bonus, VMOVP isn't required anymore of moving a VPE between
redistributors that share the same affinity.

Let's add this support to the VMOVP builder, and make sure we don't
issue the command if we don't really need to.
