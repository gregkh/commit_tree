ARM: configs: Cleanup old Kconfig options

CONFIG_MMC_BLOCK_BOUNCE is gone since commit c3dccb74be28 ("mmc: core:
Delete bounce buffer Kconfig option").

CONFIG_LBDAF is gone since commit 72deb455b5ec ("block: remove
CONFIG_LBDAF").

CONFIG_IOSCHED_DEADLINE and CONFIG_IOSCHED_CFQ are gone since
commit f382fb0bcef4 ("block: remove legacy IO schedulers").

The IOSCHED_DEADLINE was replaced by MQ_IOSCHED_DEADLINE and it will be
now enabled by default (along with MQ_IOSCHED_KYBER).

The IOSCHED_BFQ seems to replace IOSCHED_CFQ so select it in configs
previously choosing the latter.

CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE is gone since commit f1089c92da79 ("kbuild: remove
CONFIG_CROSS_COMPILE support").
