ALSA: hda: Apply aligned MMIO access only conditionally

It turned out that the recent simplification of HD-audio bus access
helpers caused a regression on the virtual HD-audio device on QEMU
with ARM platforms.  The driver got a CORB/RIRB timeout and couldn't
probe any codecs.

The essential difference that caused a problem was the enforced
aligned MMIO accesses by simplification.  Since snd-hda-tegra driver
is enabled on ARM, it enables CONFIG_SND_HDA_ALIGNED_MMIO, which makes
the all HD-audio drivers using the aligned MMIO accesses.  While this
is mandatory for snd-hda-tegra, it seems that snd-hda-intel on ARM
gets broken by this access pattern.

For addressing the regression, this patch introduces a new flag,
aligned_mmio, to hdac_bus object, and applies the aligned MMIO only
when this flag is set.  This change affects only platforms with
CONFIG_SND_HDA_ALIGNED_MMIO set, i.e. mostly only for ARM platforms.

Unfortunately the patch became a big bigger than it should be, just
because the former calls didn't take hdac_bus object in the argument,
hence we had to extend the call patterns.
