nfs: NFS_SWAP should depend on SWAP

If CONFIG_SWAP=n, it does not make much sense to offer the user the
option to enable support for swapping over NFS, as that will still fail
at run time:

    # swapon /swap
    swapon: /swap: swapon failed: Function not implemented

Fix this by adding a dependency on CONFIG_SWAP.
