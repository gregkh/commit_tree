crypto/testmgr: enable selftests for paes-s390 ciphers

This patch enables the selftests for the s390 specific protected key
AES (PAES) cipher implementations:
  * cbc-paes-s390
  * ctr-paes-s390
  * ecb-paes-s390
  * xts-paes-s390
PAES is an AES cipher but with encrypted ('protected') key
material. However, the paes ciphers are able to derive an protected
key from clear key material with the help of the pkey kernel module.

So this patch now enables the generic AES tests for the paes
ciphers. Under the hood the setkey() functions rearrange the clear key
values as clear key token and so the pkey kernel module is able to
provide protected key blobs from the given clear key values. The
derived protected key blobs are then used within the paes cipers and
should produce the very same results as the generic AES implementation
with the clear key values.

The s390-paes cipher testlist entries are surrounded
by #if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_CRYPTO_PAES_S390) because they don't
make any sense on non s390 platforms or without the PAES
cipher implementation.
