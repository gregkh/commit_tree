irqchip/gic-v4.1: Implement the v4.1 flavour of VMAPP

The ITS VMAPP command gains some new fields with GICv4.1:
- a default doorbell, which allows a single doorbell to be used for
  all the VLPIs routed to a given VPE
- a pointer to the configuration table (instead of having it in a register
  that gets context switched)
- a flag indicating whether this is the first map or the last unmap for
  this particular VPE
- a flag indicating whether the pending table is known to be zeroed, or not

Plumb in the new fields in the VMAPP builder, and add the map/unmap
refcounting so that the ITS can do the right thing.
