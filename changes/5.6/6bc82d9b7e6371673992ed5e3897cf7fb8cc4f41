qed: rt init valid initialization changed

The QM phase init tool can be invoked multiple times during
the driver lifetime. Part of the init comes from the runtime array.
The logic for setting the values did not init all values, basically
assuming the runtime array was all zeroes. But if it was invoked
multiple times, nobody was zeroing it after the first time.

In this change we zero the runtime array right after using it.
