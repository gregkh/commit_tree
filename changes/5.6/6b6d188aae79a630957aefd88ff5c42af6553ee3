alarmtimer: Unregister wakeup source when module get fails

The alarmtimer_rtc_add_device() function creates a wakeup source and then
tries to grab a module reference. If that fails the function returns early
with an error code, but fails to remove the wakeup source.

Cleanup this exit path so there is no dangling wakeup source, which is
named 'alarmtime' left allocated which will conflict with another RTC
device that may be registered later.
