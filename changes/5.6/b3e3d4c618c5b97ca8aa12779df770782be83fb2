scsi: libsas: Tidy SAS address print format

Currently we use a mixture of %016llx, %llx, and %16llx when printing a SAS
address.

Since the most significant nibble of the SAS address is always 5 - as per
standard - this formatting is not so important; but some fake SAS addresses
for SATA devices may not be. And we have mangled/invalid address to
consider also. And it's better to be consistent in the code, so use a fixed
format.

The SAS address is a fixed size at 64b, so we want to 0 byte extend to 16
nibbles, so use %016llx globally.

Also make some prints to be explicitly hex, and tidy some whitespace issue.
