drm/i915/pmu: Correct the rc6 offset upon enabling

The rc6 residency starts ticking from 0 from BIOS POST, but the kernel
starts measuring the time from its boot. If we start measuruing
I915_PMU_RC6_RESIDENCY while the GT is idle, we start our sampling from
0 and then upon first activity (park/unpark) add in all the rc6
residency since boot. After the first park with the sampler engaged, the
sleep/active counters are aligned.

v2: With a wakeref to be sure
