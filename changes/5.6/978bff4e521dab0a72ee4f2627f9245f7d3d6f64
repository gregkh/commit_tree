powerpc/pseries/svm: Allow IOMMU to work in SVM

H_PUT_TCE_INDIRECT uses a shared page to send up to 512 TCE to
a hypervisor in a single hypercall. This does not work for secure VMs
as the page needs to be shared or the VM should use H_PUT_TCE instead.

This disables H_PUT_TCE_INDIRECT by clearing the FW_FEATURE_PUT_TCE_IND
feature bit so SVMs will map TCEs using H_PUT_TCE.

This is not a part of init_svm() as it is called too late after FW
patching is done and may result in a warning like this:

[    3.727716] Firmware features changed after feature patching!
[    3.727965] WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at (...)arch/powerpc/lib/feature-fixups.c:466 check_features+0xa4/0xc0
