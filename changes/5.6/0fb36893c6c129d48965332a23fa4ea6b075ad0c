media: vidioc-enum-fmt.rst: clarify format preference

It has been decided to use the ENUM_FMT index value
as a hint for driver preference. This is defined purposedly
in a very liberal way, letting drivers define what "preference"
means.

For instance, the Hantro VPU driver indicates additional
processing to output a given format, and thus implicates
more CPU usage, which is enumerated after native (non-processed)
formats.
