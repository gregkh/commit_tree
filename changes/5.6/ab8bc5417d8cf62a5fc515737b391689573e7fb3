compat_ioctl: cdrom: handle CDROM_LAST_WRITTEN

This is the only ioctl command that does not have a proper
compat handler. Making the normal implementation do the
right thing is actually very simply, so just do that by
using an in_compat_syscall() check to avoid the special
case in the pkcdvd driver.
