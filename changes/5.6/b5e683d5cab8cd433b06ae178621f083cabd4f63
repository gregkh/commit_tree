eventfd: track eventfd_signal() recursion depth

eventfd use cases from aio and io_uring can deadlock due to circular
or resursive calling, when eventfd_signal() tries to grab the waitqueue
lock. On top of that, it's also possible to construct notification
chains that are deep enough that we could blow the stack.

Add a percpu counter that tracks the percpu recursion depth, warn if we
exceed it. The counter is also exposed so that users of eventfd_signal()
can do the right thing if it's non-zero in the context where it is
called.
