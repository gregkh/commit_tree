mm/page_alloc.c: fix uninitialized memmaps on a partially populated last section

Patch series "mm: fix max_pfn not falling on section boundary", v2.

Playing with different memory sizes for a x86-64 guest, I discovered that
some memmaps (highest section if max_mem does not fall on the section
boundary) are marked as being valid and online, but contain garbage.  We
have to properly initialize these memmaps.

Looking at /proc/kpageflags and friends, I found some more issues,
partially related to this.

This patch (of 3):

If max_pfn is not aligned to a section boundary, we can easily run into
BUGs.  This can e.g., be triggered on x86-64 under QEMU by specifying a
memory size that is not a multiple of 128MB (e.g., 4097MB, but also
4160MB).  I was told that on real HW, we can easily have this scenario
(esp., one of the main reasons sub-section hotadd of devmem was added).

The issue is, that we have a valid memmap (pfn_valid()) for the whole
section, and the whole section will be marked "online".
pfn_to_online_page() will succeed, but the memmap contains garbage.

E.g., doing a "./page-types -r -a 0x144001" when QEMU was started with "-m
4160M" - (see tools/vm/page-types.c):

This patch fixes that by at least zero-ing out that memmap (so e.g.,
page_to_pfn() will not crash).  Commit 907ec5fca3dc ("mm: zero remaining
unavailable struct pages") tried to fix a similar issue, but forgot to
consider this special case.

After this patch, there are still problems to solve.  E.g., not all of
these pages falling into a memory hole will actually get initialized later
and set PageReserved - they are only zeroed out - but at least the
immediate crashes are gone.  A follow-up patch will take care of this.
