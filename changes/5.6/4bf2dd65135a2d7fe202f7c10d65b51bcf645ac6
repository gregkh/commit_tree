usb: cdns3: gadget: toggle cycle bit before reset endpoint

If there are TRBs pending during reset endpoint operation, the
DMA will advance after reset operation, but it isn't expected,
since the data is not yet available (For OUT, the data is not
yet available). After the data is ready, there won't be any
interrupt since the EP_TRADDR already points to next TRB entry
and doorbell is not set.

To fix it, it toggles cycle bit before reset operation, and restores
it after reset, it could avoid unexpected DMA advance due to
cycle bit is for software during the endpoint reset operation.
