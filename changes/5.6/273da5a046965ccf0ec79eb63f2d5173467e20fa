drm/tegra: Reuse IOVA mapping where possible

This partially reverts the DMA API support that was recently merged
because it was causing performance regressions on older Tegra devices.
Unfortunately, the cache maintenance performed by dma_map_sg() and
dma_unmap_sg() causes performance to drop by a factor of 10.

The right solution for this would be to cache mappings for buffers per
consumer device, but that's a bit involved. Instead, we simply revert to
the old behaviour of sharing IOVA mappings when we know that devices can
do so (i.e. they share the same IOMMU domain).
