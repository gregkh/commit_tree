initramfs: generate dependency list and cpio at the same time

Currently, this script is run twice, for the dependency list, and then
for the cpio archive.

The first one is re-run every time although its build log is suppressed
so nobody notices it.

Make it work more efficiently by generating the cpio and the dependency
list at the same time.
