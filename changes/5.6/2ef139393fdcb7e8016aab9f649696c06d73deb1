clk: imx8m: Suppress bind attrs

The clock drivers on imx8m series are registered as platform devices and
this opens the possibility of reloading the driver at runtime.

This doesn't actually work: clocks are never removed and attempting to
bind again results in registration errors and a crash. Almost all
devices depend on clocks anyway so rebinding is unlikely to ever be
useful

Fix this by explicitly suppressing bind attrs like several other
clock drivers.
