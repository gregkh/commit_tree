nfs: lift setting mount_info from nfs4_remote{,_referral}_mount

Do that (fhandle allocation, setting struct server up) in
nfs4_referral_mount() and nfs4_try_mount() resp. and pass the
server and pointer to mount_info into nfs_do_root_mount() so that
nfs4_remote_referral_mount()/nfs_remote_mount() could be merged.

Since we are moving stuff from ->mount() instances to the points
prior to vfs_kern_mount() that would trigger those, we need to
make sure that do_nfs_root_mount() will do the corresponding
cleanup itself if it doesn't trigger those ->mount() instances.
