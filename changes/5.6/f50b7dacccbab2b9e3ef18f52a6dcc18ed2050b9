arm64: smp: fix crash_smp_send_stop() behaviour

On a system configured to trigger a crash_kexec() reboot, when only one CPU
is online and another CPU panics while starting-up, crash_smp_send_stop()
will fail to send any STOP message to the other already online core,
resulting in fail to freeze and registers not properly saved.

Moreover even if the proper messages are sent (case CPUs > 2)
it will similarly fail to account for the booting CPU when executing
the final stop wait-loop, so potentially resulting in some CPU not
been waited for shutdown before rebooting.

A tangible effect of this behaviour can be observed when, after a panic
with kexec enabled and loaded, on the following reboot triggered by kexec,
the cpu that could not be successfully stopped fails to come back online:

Make crash_smp_send_stop() account also for the online status of the
calling CPU while evaluating how many CPUs are effectively online: this way
the right number of STOPs is sent and all other stopped-cores's registers
are properly saved.
