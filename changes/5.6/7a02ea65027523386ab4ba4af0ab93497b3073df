net: sched: prevent a use after free

The bug is that we call kfree_skb(skb) and then pass "skb" to
qdisc_pkt_len(skb) on the next line, which is a use after free.
Also Cong Wang points out that it's better to delay the actual
frees until we drop the rtnl lock so we should use rtnl_kfree_skbs()
instead of kfree_skb().
