serdev: Fix detection of UART devices on Apple machines.

On Apple devices the _CRS method returns an empty resource template, and
the resource settings are instead provided by the _DSM method. But
commit 33364d63c75d6182fa369cea80315cf1bb0ee38e (serdev: Add ACPI
devices by ResourceSource field) changed the search for serdev devices
to require valid, non-empty resource template, thereby breaking Apple
devices and causing bluetooth devices to not be found.

This expands the check so that if we don't find a valid template, and
we're on an Apple machine, then just check for the device being an
immediate child of the controller and having a "baud" property.
