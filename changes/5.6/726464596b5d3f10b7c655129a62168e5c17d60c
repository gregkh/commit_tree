MAINTAINERS: eCryptfs: Update maintainer address and downgrade status

Adjust my email address to a personal account. Downgrade the status of
eCryptfs maintenance to 'Odd Fixes' since it has not been part of my
work responsibilities recently and I've had little personal time to
devote to it.

eCryptfs hasn't seen active development in some time. New deployments of
file level encryption should use more modern solutions, such as fscrypt,
where possible.
