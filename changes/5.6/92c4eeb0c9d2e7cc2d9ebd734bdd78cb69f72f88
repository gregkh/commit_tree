drm/udl: Remove flags field from struct udl_gem_object

The flags field in struct udl_gem controls mapping parameters: cached
access for local buffers, write-combined access for imported buffers.

We can drop the field and distinguish both cases by testing whether
struct drm_gem_object.import_attach is NULL.
