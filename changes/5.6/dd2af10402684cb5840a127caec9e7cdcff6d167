net/sched: act_ct: Fix leak of ct zone template on replace

Currently, on replace, the previous action instance params
is swapped with a newly allocated params. The old params is
only freed (via kfree_rcu), without releasing the allocated
ct zone template related to it.

Call tcf_ct_params_free (via call_rcu) for the old params,
so it will release it.
