sched/uclamp: Reject negative values in cpu_uclamp_write()

The check to ensure that the new written value into cpu.uclamp.{min,max}
is within range, [0:100], wasn't working because of the signed
comparison

 7301                 if (req.percent > UCLAMP_PERCENT_SCALE) {
 7302                         req.ret = -ERANGE;
 7303                         return req;
 7304                 }

	# echo -1 > cpu.uclamp.min
	# cat cpu.uclamp.min
	42949671.96

Cast req.percent into u64 to force the comparison to be unsigned and
work as intended in capacity_from_percent().

	# echo -1 > cpu.uclamp.min
	sh: write error: Numerical result out of range
