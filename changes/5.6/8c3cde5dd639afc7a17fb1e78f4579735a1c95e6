serial: 8250_bcm2835aux: Allocate uart_8250_port on stack

The bcm2835aux UART driver stores a struct uart_8250_port in its private
data even though it's only passed once to serial8250_register_8250_port()
(which copies all relevant data) and becomes obsolete afterwards.
Allocate the struct on the stack instead for simplicity and to conserve
memory.

The driver also initializes a spinlock in the struct which is never used.
Drop that as well.
