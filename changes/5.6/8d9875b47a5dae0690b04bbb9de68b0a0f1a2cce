drm/i915: Don't set undefined bits in dirty_pipes

skl_commit_modeset_enables() straight up compares dirty_pipes
with a bitmask of already committed pipes. If we set bits in
dirty_pipes for non-existent pipes that comparison will never
work right. So let's limit ourselves to bits that exist.

And we'll do the same for the active_pipes_changed bitmask.
