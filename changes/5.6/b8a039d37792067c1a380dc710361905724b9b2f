regulator: rk808: Lower log level on optional GPIOs being not available

RK808 can leverage a couple of GPIOs to tweak the ramp rate during DVS
(Dynamic Voltage Scaling). These GPIOs are entirely optional but a
dev_warn() appeared when cleaning this driver to use a more up-to-date
gpiod API. At least reduce the log level to 'info' as it is totally
fine to not populate these GPIO on a hardware design.

This change is trivial but it is worth not polluting the logs during
bringup phase by having real warnings and errors sorted out
correctly.
