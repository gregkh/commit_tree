PCI/switchtec: Add Gen4 MRPC GAS access permission check

Gen4 hardware provides new MRPC commands to read and write directly from
any address in the PCI BAR (which Microsemi refers to as GAS). Since
accessing BARs can be dangerous and break the driver, we don't want
unprivileged users to have this ability.

Therefore, require CAP_SYS_ADMIN for the local and remote GAS access MRPC
commands. Privileged processes will already have access to the BAR through
the sysfs resource file so this doesn't give userspace any capabilities it
didn't already have.
