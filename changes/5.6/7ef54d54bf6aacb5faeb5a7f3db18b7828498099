btrfs: Open code __btrfs_free_reserved_extent in btrfs_free_reserved_extent

__btrfs_free_reserved_extent performs 2 entirely different operations
depending on whether its 'pin' argument is true or false. This patch
lifts the 2nd case (pin is false) into it's sole caller
btrfs_free_reserved_extent. No semantics changes.
