ALSA: pci: echoaudio: remove usage of dimen menber of elem_value structure

In a couple of years ago, 'echomixer' userspace application was revised
not to use 'dimen' member of 'struct snd_ctl_elem_info'.

This commit removes usage of 'dimen' member from echoaudio PCI driver so
that no implementation uses the member.
