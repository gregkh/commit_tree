dmaengine: idxd: Init and probe for Intel data accelerators

The idxd driver introduces the Intel Data Stream Accelerator [1] that will
be available on future Intel Xeon CPUs. One of the kernel access
point for the driver is through the dmaengine subsystem. It will initially
provide the DMA copy service to the kernel.

Some of the main functionality introduced with this accelerator
are: shared virtual memory (SVM) support, and descriptor submission using
Intel CPU instructions movdir64b and enqcmds. There will be additional
accelerator devices that share the same driver with variations to
capabilities.

This commit introduces the probe and initialization component of the
driver.
