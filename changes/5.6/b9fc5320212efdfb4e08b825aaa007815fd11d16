scsi: ufs: Fix ufshcd_probe_hba() reture value in case ufshcd_scsi_add_wlus() fails

A non-zero error value likely being returned by ufshcd_scsi_add_wlus() in
case of failure of adding the WLs, but ufshcd_probe_hba() doesn't use this
value, and doesn't report this failure to upper caller.  This patch is to
fix this issue.
