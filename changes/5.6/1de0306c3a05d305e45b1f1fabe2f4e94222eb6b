net/mlx5e: Enhance ICOSQ WQE info fields

Add number of WQEBBs (WQE's Basic Block) to WQE info struct. Set the
number of WQEBBs on WQE post, and increment the consumer counter (cc)
on completion.

In case of error completions, the cc was mistakenly not incremented,
keeping a gap between cc and pc (producer counter). This failed the
recovery flow on the ICOSQ from a CQE error which timed-out waiting for
the cc and pc to meet.
