drm/i915/gem: Excise the per-batch whitelist from the context

One does not lightly add a new hidden struct_mutex dependency deep within
the execbuf bowels! The immediate suspicion in seeing the whitelist
cached on the context, is that it is intended to be preserved between
batches, as the kernel is quite adept at caching small allocations
itself. But no, it's sole purpose is to serialise command submission in
order to save a kmalloc on a slow, slow path!

By removing the whitelist dependency from the context, our freedom to
chop the big struct_mutex is greatly augmented.

v2: s/set_bit/__set_bit/ as the whitelist shall never be accessed
concurrently.
