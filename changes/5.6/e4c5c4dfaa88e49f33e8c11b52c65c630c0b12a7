iio: adc: new driver to support Linear technology's ltc2496

This chip is similar to the LTC2497 ADC, it just uses SPI instead of I2C
and so has a slightly different protocol. Only the actual hardware
access is different. The spi protocol is different enough to not be able
to map the differences via a regmap.

Also generalize the entry in MAINTAINER to cover the newly introduced
file.
