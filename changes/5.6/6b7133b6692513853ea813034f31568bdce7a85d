drm/i915/gt: Always reset the timeslice after a context switch

Currently, we reset the timer after a pre-eemption event. This has the
side-effect that the timeslice runs into the second context after the
first is completed after a normal promotion event, causing the second
context to be swapped out early and switched for a third context. To be
more fair, we want to reset the clock after promotion as well.
