ACPI: PM: s2idle: Check fixed wakeup events in acpi_s2idle_wake()

Commit fdde0ff8590b ("ACPI: PM: s2idle: Prevent spurious SCIs from
waking up the system") overlooked the fact that fixed events can wake
up the system too and broke RTC wakeup from suspend-to-idle as a
result.

Fix this issue by checking the fixed events in acpi_s2idle_wake() in
addition to checking wakeup GPEs and break out of the suspend-to-idle
loop if the status bits of any enabled fixed events are set then.
