console/dummycon: Remove bogus depends on from DUMMY_CONSOLE

Since commit [1] consolidated console configuration in
drivers/video/console, DUMMY_CONSOLE has always been enabled, since the
dependency is always satisfied.

There is no point in trying to allow it to be configured out, since
(a) it's tiny, and (b) if VT_CONSOLE is enabled, we must have a working
console driver by the time con_init(vt.c) runs, and only dummycon is
guaranteed to work (vgacon may be configured in, but that doesn't mean
we have a VGA device).

So just remove the fake dependency.
