selftests/bpf: Restore original comm in test_overhead

test_overhead changes task comm in order to estimate BPF trampoline
overhead but never sets the comm back to the original one.
We have the tests (like core_reloc.c) that have 'test_progs'
as hard-coded expected comm, so let's try to preserve the
original comm.

Currently, everything works because the order of execution is:
first core_recloc, then test_overhead; but let's make it a bit
future-proof.

Other related changes: use 'test_overhead' as new comm instead of
'test' to make it easy to debug and drop '\n' at the end.
