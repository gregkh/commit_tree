drm/i915/dsc: move DP specific compute params to intel_dp.c

Turns out future DSI specific parameters aren't workable with the
approach of having the encoder specific functions in intel_vdsc.c. Make
intel_dsc_compute_params() a helper that does the encoder independent
parts, and have encoder code call it. Move intel_dsc_dp_compute_params()
to intel_dp.c as intel_dp_dsc_compute_params().

No functional changes.

v2: Rename pipe_config to crtc_state while at it.
