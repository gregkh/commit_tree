rcu: Rename sync_rcu_preempt_exp_done() to sync_rcu_exp_done()

Now that the RCU flavors have been consolidated, there is one common
function for checking to see if an expedited RCU grace period has
completed, namely sync_rcu_preempt_exp_done().  Because this function is
no longer specific to RCU-preempt, this commit removes the "_preempt" from
its name.  This commit also changes sync_rcu_preempt_exp_done_unlocked()
to sync_rcu_exp_done_unlocked() for the same reason.
