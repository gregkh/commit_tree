mmc: mmci: Support any block sizes for ux500v2 and qcom variant

For the ux500v2 variant of the PL18x block, any block sizes
are supported. This is necessary to support some SDIO
transfers. This also affects the QCOM MMCI variant and the
ST micro variant.

For Ux500 an additional quirk only allowing DMA on blocks
that are a power of two is needed. This might be a bug in
the DMA engine (DMA40) or the MMCI or in the interconnect,
but the most likely is the MMCI, as transfers of these
sizes work fine for other devices using the same DMA
engine. DMA works fine also with SDIO as long as the
blocksize is a power of 2.

This patch has proven necessary for enabling SDIO for WLAN on
PostmarketOS-based Ux500 platforms.

What we managed to test in practice is Broadcom WiFi over
SDIO on the Ux500 based Samsung GT-I8190 and GT-S7710.
This WiFi chip, BCM4334 works fine after the patch.

Before this patch:

brcmfmac: brcmf_fw_alloc_request: using brcm/brcmfmac4334-sdio
	  for chip BCM4334/3
mmci-pl18x 80118000.sdi1_per2: unsupported block size (60 bytes)
brcmfmac: brcmf_sdiod_ramrw: membytes transfer failed
brcmfmac: brcmf_sdio_download_code_file: error -22 on writing
	  434236 membytes at 0x00000000
brcmfmac: brcmf_sdio_download_firmware: dongle image file download
	  failed

After this patch:

brcmfmac: brcmf_c_preinit_dcmds: Firmware: BCM4334/3 wl0:
	  Nov 21 2012 00:21:28 version 6.10.58.813 (B2) FWID 01-0

Bringing up networks, discovering networks with "iw dev wlan0 scan"
and connecting works fine from this point.

This patch is inspired by Ulf Hansson's patch
http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-mmc/msg12160.html

As the DMA engines on these platforms may now get block sizes
they were not used to before, make sure to also respect if
the DMA engine says "no" to a transfer.

Make a drive-by fix for datactrl_blocksz, misspelled.
