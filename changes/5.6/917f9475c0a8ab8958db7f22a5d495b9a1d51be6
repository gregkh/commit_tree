KVM: x86: reorganize pvclock_gtod_data members

We will need a copy of tk->offs_boot in the next patch.  Store it and
cleanup the struct: instead of storing tk->tkr_xxx.base with the tk->offs_boot
included, store the raw value in struct pvclock_clock and sum it in
do_monotonic_raw and do_realtime.   tk->tkr_xxx.xtime_nsec also moves
to struct pvclock_clock.

While at it, fix a (usually harmless) typo in do_monotonic_raw, which
was using gtod->clock.shift instead of gtod->raw_clock.shift.

Fixes: 53fafdbb8b21f ("KVM: x86: switch KVMCLOCK base to monotonic raw clock")
