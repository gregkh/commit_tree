io_uring: spin for sq thread to idle on shutdown

As part of io_uring shutdown, we cancel work that is pending and won't
necessarily complete on its own. That includes requests like poll
commands and timeouts.

If we're using SQPOLL for kernel side submission and we shutdown the
ring immediately after queueing such work, we can race with the sqthread
doing the submission. This means we may miss cancelling some work, which
results in the io_uring shutdown hanging forever.
