usb: musb: omap2430: Handle multiple ID ground interrupts

We currently get "unhandled DISCONNECT transition" warnings from musb core
on device disconnect as things are wrongly set to OTG_STATE_A_IDLE in
host mode when enumerating devices. We can also get "Failed to write reg
index" errors after enumerating.

This is happening at least with cpcap phy where we get multiple ID ground
interrupts. Looks like it's VBUS keeps timing out and needs to be kicked
when the phy sends multiple ID ground interrupts during host mode.
