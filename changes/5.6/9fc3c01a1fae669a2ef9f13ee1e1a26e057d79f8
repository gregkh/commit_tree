Tools: hv: Reopen the devices if read() or write() returns errors

The state machine in the hv_utils driver can run out of order in some
corner cases, e.g. if the kvp daemon doesn't call write() fast enough
due to some reason, kvp_timeout_func() can run first and move the state
to HVUTIL_READY; next, when kvp_on_msg() is called it returns -EINVAL
since kvp_transaction.state is smaller than HVUTIL_USERSPACE_REQ; later,
the daemon's write() gets an error -EINVAL, and the daemon will exit().

We can reproduce the issue by sending a SIGSTOP signal to the daemon, wait
for 1 minute, and send a SIGCONT signal to the daemon: the daemon will
exit() quickly.

We can fix the issue by forcing a reset of the device (which means the
daemon can close() and open() the device again) and doing extra necessary
clean-up.
