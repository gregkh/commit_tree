r8169: fix PHY driver check on platforms w/o module softdeps

On Android/x86 the module loading infrastructure can't deal with
softdeps. Therefore the check for presence of the Realtek PHY driver
module fails. mdiobus_register() will try to load the PHY driver
module, therefore move the check to after this call and explicitly
check that a dedicated PHY driver is bound to the PHY device.
