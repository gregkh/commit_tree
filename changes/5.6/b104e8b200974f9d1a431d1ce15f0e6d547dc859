drm/i915: Pass cpu transcoder to assert_pipe()

In order to eliminate intel_pipe_to_cpu_transcoder() (and its
crtc->config usage) let's pass the cpu transcoder to
assert_pipe() so we don't have to do the pipe->cpu transcoder
lookup on HSW+.

On VLV/CHV this can get called during eDP init, which
happens before crtc->config->cpu_transcoder is even
populated. So currently we're always reading PIPECONF(A)
there even if we're trying to check the state of some
other pipe.
