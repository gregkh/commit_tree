visorbus: fix uninitialized variable access

The setup_crash_devices_work_queue function only partially initializes
the message it sends to chipset_init, leading to undefined behavior:

drivers/visorbus/visorchipset.c: In function 'setup_crash_devices_work_queue':
drivers/visorbus/visorchipset.c:333:6: error: '((unsigned char*)&msg.hdr.flags)[0]' is used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=uninitialized]
  if (inmsg->hdr.flags.response_expected)

Set up the entire structure, zero-initializing the 'response_expected'
flag.

This was apparently found by the patch that added the -O3 build option
in Kconfig.
