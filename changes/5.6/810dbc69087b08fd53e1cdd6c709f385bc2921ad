RDMA/iwcm: Fix iwcm work deallocation

The dealloc_work_entries() function must update the work_free_list pointer
while freeing its entries, since potentially called again on same list. A
second iteration of the work list caused system crash. This happens, if
work allocation fails during cma_iw_listen() and free_cm_id() tries to
free the list again during cleanup.
