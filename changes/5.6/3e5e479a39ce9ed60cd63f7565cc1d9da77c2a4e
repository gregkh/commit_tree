f2fs: fix to add swap extent correctly

As Youling reported in mailing list:

https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/the-file-system-f2fs-is-broken-4175666043/

https://www.linux.org/threads/the-file-system-f2fs-is-broken.26490/

There is a test case can corrupt f2fs image:
- dd if=/dev/zero of=/swapfile bs=1M count=4096
- chmod 600 /swapfile
- mkswap /swapfile
- swapon --discard /swapfile

The root cause is f2fs_swap_activate() intends to return zero value
to setup_swap_extents() to enable SWP_FS mode (swap file goes through
fs), in this flow, setup_swap_extents() setups swap extent with wrong
block address range, result in discard_swap() erasing incorrect address.

Because f2fs_swap_activate() has pinned swapfile, its data block
address will not change, it's safe to let swap to handle IO through
raw device, so we can get rid of SWAP_FS mode and initial swap extents
inside f2fs_swap_activate(), by this way, later discard_swap() can trim
in right address range.
