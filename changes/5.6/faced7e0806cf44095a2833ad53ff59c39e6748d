mm: hugetlb controller for cgroups v2

In the effort of supporting cgroups v2 into Kubernetes, I stumped on
the lack of the hugetlb controller.

When the controller is enabled, it exposes four new files for each
hugetlb size on non-root cgroups:

- hugetlb.<hugepagesize>.current
- hugetlb.<hugepagesize>.max
- hugetlb.<hugepagesize>.events
- hugetlb.<hugepagesize>.events.local

The differences with the legacy hierarchy are in the file names and
using the value "max" instead of "-1" to disable a limit.

The file .limit_in_bytes is renamed to .max.

The file .usage_in_bytes is renamed to .current.

.failcnt is not provided as a single file anymore, but its value can
be read through the new flat-keyed files .events and .events.local,
through the "max" key.
