ext4: improve explanation of a mount failure caused by a misconfigured kernel

If CONFIG_QFMT_V2 is not enabled, but CONFIG_QUOTA is enabled, when a
user tries to mount a file system with the quota or project quota
enabled, the kernel will emit a very confusing messsage:

    EXT4-fs warning (device vdc): ext4_enable_quotas:5914: Failed to enable quota tracking (type=0, err=-3). Please run e2fsck to fix.
    EXT4-fs (vdc): mount failed

We will now report an explanatory message indicating which kernel
configuration options have to be enabled, to avoid customer/sysadmin
confusion.
