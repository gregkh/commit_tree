arm64: dts: ls208xa: Update qspi node properties for LS2088ARDB

LS2088ADB has one spansion flash s25fs512s of size 64M.

Add qspi dts entry for the board using compatibles as "jedec,spi-nor" to
probe flash successfully. Also, align properties with other board dts
properties.

Use dt-bindings constants in interrupts instead of using numbers.
