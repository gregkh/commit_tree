netlink: allow extack cookie also for error messages

Commit ba0dc5f6e0ba ("netlink: allow sending extended ACK with cookie on
success") introduced a cookie which can be sent to userspace as part of
extended ack message in the form of NLMSGERR_ATTR_COOKIE attribute.
Currently the cookie is ignored if error code is non-zero but there is
no technical reason for such limitation and it can be useful to provide
machine parseable information as part of an error message.

Include NLMSGERR_ATTR_COOKIE whenever the cookie has been set,
regardless of error code.
