rcu/nocb: Fix dump_tree hierarchy print always active

Commit 18cd8c93e69e ("rcu/nocb: Print gp/cb kthread hierarchy if
dump_tree") added print statements to rcu_organize_nocb_kthreads for
debugging, but incorrectly guarded them, causing the function to always
spew out its message.

This patch fixes it by guarding both pr_alert statements with dump_tree,
while also changing the second pr_alert to a pr_cont, to print the
hierarchy in a single line (assuming that's how it was supposed to
work).
