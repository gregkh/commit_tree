ARM: dts: ux500: Use "arm,pl031" compatible for PL031

The Ux500 device tree uses "arm,rtc-pl031" as compatible for PL031.
All other boards in Linux describe it using "arm,pl031" instead.
This works because the compatible is not actually used in Linux:
AMBA devices get probed based on "arm,primecell" and their peripheral ID.

Nevertheless, some other projects (e.g. U-Boot) rely on the compatible
to probe the device with the correct driver. Those will look for
"arm,pl031" instead of "arm,rtc-pl031", preventing the RTC from being
probed.

Change it to "arm,pl031" to match all other boards.
