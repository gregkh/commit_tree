ARM: dts: at91: sama5d3: fix maximum peripheral clock rates

Currently the maximum rate for peripheral clock is calculated based on a
typical 133MHz MCK. The maximum frequency is defined in the datasheet as a
ratio to MCK. Some sama5d3 platforms are using a 166MHz MCK. Update the
device trees to match the maximum rate based on 166MHz.
