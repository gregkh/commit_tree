net/mlx5: IPsec, fix memory leak at mlx5_fpga_ipsec_delete_sa_ctx

SA context is allocated at mlx5_fpga_ipsec_create_sa_ctx,
however the counterpart mlx5_fpga_ipsec_delete_sa_ctx function
nullifies sa_ctx pointer without freeing the memory allocated,
hence the memory leak.

Fix by free SA context when the SA is released.
