tcp: export count for rehash attempts

Using IPv6 flow-label to swiftly route around avoid congested or
disconnected network path can greatly improve TCP reliability.

This patch adds SNMP counters and a OPT_STATS counter to track both
host-level and connection-level statistics. Network administrators
can use these counters to evaluate the impact of this new ability better.

Export count for rehash attempts to
1) two SNMP counters: TcpTimeoutRehash (rehash due to timeouts),
   and TcpDuplicateDataRehash (rehash due to receiving duplicate
   packets)
2) Timestamping API SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS.
