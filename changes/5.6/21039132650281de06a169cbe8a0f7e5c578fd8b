gfs2_atomic_open(): fix O_EXCL|O_CREAT handling on cold dcache

with the way fs/namei.c:do_last() had been done, ->atomic_open()
instances needed to recognize the case when existing file got
found with O_EXCL|O_CREAT, either by falling back to finish_no_open()
or failing themselves.  gfs2 one didn't.
