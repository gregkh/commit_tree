ALSA: hda: Use scnprintf() for printing texts for sysfs/procfs

Some code in HD-audio driver calls snprintf() in a loop and still
expects that the return value were actually written size, while
snprintf() returns the expected would-be length instead.  When the
given buffer limit were small, this leads to a buffer overflow.

Use scnprintf() for addressing those issues.  It returns the actually
written size unlike snprintf().
