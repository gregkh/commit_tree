ARM: dts: renesas: Group tuples in regulator-gpio states properties

To improve human readability and enable automatic validation, the tuples
in the "states" properties of device nodes compatible with
"regulator-gpio" should be grouped, as reported by "make dtbs_check":

    $ make dtbs_check DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/gpio-regulator.yaml
    arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791-koelsch.dt.yaml: regulator-vccq-sdhi0: states:0: Additional items are not allowed (1800000, 0 were unexpected)
    arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791-koelsch.dt.yaml: regulator-vccq-sdhi0: states:0: [3300000, 1, 1800000, 0] is too long
    arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791-koelsch.dt.yaml: regulator-vccq-sdhi1: states:0: Additional items are not allowed (1800000, 0 were unexpected)
    arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791-koelsch.dt.yaml: regulator-vccq-sdhi1: states:0: [3300000, 1, 1800000, 0] is too long
    arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791-koelsch.dt.yaml: regulator-vccq-sdhi2: states:0: Additional items are not allowed (1800000, 0 were unexpected)
    arch/arm/boot/dts/r8a7791-koelsch.dt.yaml: regulator-vccq-sdhi2: states:0: [3300000, 1, 1800000, 0] is too long
    ...

Fix this by grouping the tuples using angle brackets.
