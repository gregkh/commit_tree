drm/msm: Don't init ww_mutec acquire ctx before needed

For locking semantics it really doesn't matter when we grab the
ticket. But for lockdep validation it does: the acquire ctx is a fake
lockdep. Since other drivers might want to do a full multi-lock dance
in their fault-handler, not just lock a single dma_resv. Therefore we
must init the acquire_ctx only after we've done all the copy_*_user or
anything else that might trigger a pagefault. For msm this means we
need to move it past submit_lookup_objects.

Aside: Why is msm still using struct_mutex, it seems to be using
dma_resv_lock for general buffer state protection?

v2:
- Add comment to explain why the ww ticket setup is separate (Rob)
- Fix up error handling, we need to make sure we don't call
  ww_acquire_fini without _init.
