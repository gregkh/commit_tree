IB/hfi1: Add fast and slow handlers for receive context

This patch eliminate special cases by adding a fast_handler member to the
receive context and changes to the fast handler as specified in the new
variable. Initialize the variable as soon as the setting for dma tail is
known when the context is created.

Setting fast path is called every time when any context has entered slow
path. Add function to check if contexts is using fast path and do not set
fast path when it is already done to improve RCD fastpath setting.
