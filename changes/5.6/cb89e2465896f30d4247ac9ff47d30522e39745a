selinux: remove redundant allocation and helper functions

This patch removes the inode, file, and superblock security blob
allocation functions and moves the associated code into the
respective LSM hooks.  This patch also removes the inode_doinit()
function as it was a trivial wrapper around
inode_doinit_with_dentry() and called from one location in the code.
