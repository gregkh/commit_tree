Revert "drm/bridge: Add an ->atomic_check() hook"

This reverts commit b86d895524ab ("drm/bridge: Add an ->atomic_check()
hook"). Commit 6ed7e9625fa6 ("drm/bridge: Add a drm_bridge_state
object") introduced a circular dependency between drm.ko and
drm_kms_helper.ko which uncovered a misdesign in how the whole thing
was implemented. Let's revert all patches depending on the bridge_state
infrastructure for now.
