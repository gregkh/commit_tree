selinux: sidtab reverse lookup hash table

This replaces the reverse table lookup and reverse cache with a
hashtable which improves cache-miss reverse-lookup times from
O(n) to O(1)* and maintains the same performance as a reverse
cache hit.

This reduces the time needed to add a new sidtab entry from ~500us
to 5us on a Pixel 3 when there are ~10,000 sidtab entries.

The implementation uses the kernel's generic hashtable API,
It uses the context's string represtation as the hash source,
and the kernels generic string hashing algorithm full_name_hash()
to reduce the string to a 32 bit value.

This change also maintains the improvement introduced in
commit ee1a84fdfeed ("selinux: overhaul sidtab to fix bug and improve
performance") which removed the need to keep the current sidtab
locked during policy reload. It does however introduce periodic
locking of the target sidtab while converting the hashtable. Sidtab
entries are never modified or removed, so the context struct stored
in the sid_to_context tree can also be used for the context_to_sid
hashtable to reduce memory usage.

This bug was reported by:

  Bug: 140252993
  "During multi-user performance testing, we create and remove users
  many times. selinux_android_restorecon_pkgdir goes from 1ms to over
  20ms after about 200 user creations and removals. Accumulated over
  ~280 packages, that adds a significant time to user creation,
  making perf benchmarks unreliable."

* Hashtable lookup is only O(1) when n < the number of buckets.
