drm/amdkfd: Use kernel queue v9 functions for v10

The kernel queue functions for v9 and v10 are the same except
pm_map_process_v* which have small difference, so they should be reused.
This eliminates the need of reapplying several patches which were
applied on v9 but not on v10, such as bigger GWS and more than 2
SDMA engine support which were introduced on Arcturus.
