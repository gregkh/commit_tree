jbd2: switch to use jbd2_journal_abort() when failed to submit the commit record

We invoke jbd2_journal_abort() to abort the journal and record errno
in the jbd2 superblock when committing journal transaction besides the
failure on submitting the commit record. But there is no need for the
case and we can also invoke jbd2_journal_abort() instead of
__jbd2_journal_abort_hard().
