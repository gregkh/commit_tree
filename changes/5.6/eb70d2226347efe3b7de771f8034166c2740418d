btrfs: remove unnecessary pg_offset assignments in __extent_writepage()

We're initializing pg_offset to 0, setting it immediately, then
reassigning it to 0 again after. The former became unnecessary in
211c17f51f46 ("Fix corners in writepage and btrfs_truncate_page"). The
latter is a leftover that should've been removed in 40f765805f08
("Btrfs: split up __extent_writepage to lower stack usage"). Remove
both.
