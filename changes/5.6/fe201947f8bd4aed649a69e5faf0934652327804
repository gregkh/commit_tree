ath11k: update bawindow size in delba process

Currenly in delba process calling ath11k_peer_rx_tid_delete() updates
reo with desc invalid and add tid queue to the flush list. If station
send data traffic without addba req and before tid flush, hw gives
those packets as invalid desc reo error. Since we are dropping these
invalid desc packets results in traffic stall.

This patch fix this issue by updating the reo queue with bawindow size 1
instead of tid removal in delba process.
