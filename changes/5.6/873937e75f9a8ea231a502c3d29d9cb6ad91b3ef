dm thin: don't allow changing data device during thin-pool reload

The existing code allows changing the data device when the thin-pool
target is reloaded.

This capability is not required and only complicates device lifetime
guarantees. This can cause crashes like the one reported here:
	https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1788596
where the kernel tries to issue a flush bio located in a structure that
was already freed.

Take the first step to simplifying the thin-pool's data device lifetime
by disallowing changing it. Like the thin-pool's metadata device, the
data device is now set in pool_create() and it cannot be changed for a
given thin-pool.
