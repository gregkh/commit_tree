irqchip/gic-v3: Detect GICv4.1 supporting RVPEID

GICv4.1 supports the RVPEID ("Residency per vPE ID"), which allows for
a much efficient way of making virtual CPUs resident (to allow direct
injection of interrupts).

The functionnality needs to be discovered on each and every redistributor
in the system, and disabled if the settings are inconsistent.
