drm/amd/display: make PSR static screen entry within 30 ms

[Why]
With different refresh rate panels, the PSR entry/exit time is
different since it is dependent on 2 frame entry time today

[How]
Make static screen num frame entry time to be calculated
such that entry time is within 30 ms instead of fixed num
frames.
