arm: dts: qcom: db410c: Enable USB OTG support

The Dragonboard-410c is able to act either as USB Host or Device.
The role can be determined at runtime via the USB_HS_ID pin which is
derived from the micro-usb port VBUS pin.

In Host role, SoC USB D+/D- are routed to the onboard USB 2.0 HUB.
In Device role, SoC USB D+/D- are routed to the USB 2.0 micro B port.
Routing is selected via USB_SW_SEL_PM gpio.

In device role USB HUB can be held in reset.

chipidea driver expects two extcon device pointers, one for the
EXTCON_USB event and one for the EXTCON_USB_HOST event. Since
the extcon-usb-gpio device is capable of generating both these
events, point two times to this extcon device.
