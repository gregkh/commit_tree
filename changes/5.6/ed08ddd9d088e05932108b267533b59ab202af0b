linux-next: build failure after merge of the drm-misc tree

Hi all,

After merging the drm-misc tree, today's linux-next build (x86_64
allmodconfig) failed like this:

drivers/gpu/drm/bridge/analogix/analogix-anx6345.c: In function 'anx6345_i2c_probe':

      |                              ^~~~~~~~~~~~~
