vme: bridges: reduce stack usage

With CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE_O3, the stack usage in vme_fake
grows above the warning limit:

drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c: In function 'fake_master_read':
drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c:610:1: error: the frame size of 1160 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c: In function 'fake_master_write':
drivers/vme/bridges/vme_fake.c:797:1: error: the frame size of 1160 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

The problem is that in some configurations, each call to
fake_vmereadX() puts another variable on the stack.

Reduce the amount of inlining to get back to the previous state,
with no function using more than 200 bytes each.
