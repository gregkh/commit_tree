kexec: add machine_kexec_post_load()

It is the same as machine_kexec_prepare(), but is called after segments are
loaded. This way, can do processing work with already loaded relocation
segments. One such example is arm64: it has to have segments loaded in
order to create a page table, but it cannot do it during kexec time,
because at that time allocations won't be possible anymore.
