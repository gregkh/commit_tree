bpftool: Fix missing BTF output for json during map dump

The btf availability check is only done for plain text output.
It causes the whole BTF output went missing when json_output
is used.

This patch simplifies the logic a little by avoiding passing "int btf" to
map_dump().

For plain text output, the btf_wtr is only created when the map has
BTF (i.e. info->btf_id != 0).  The nullness of "json_writer_t *wtr"
in map_dump() alone can decide if dumping BTF output is needed.
As long as wtr is not NULL, map_dump() will print out the BTF-described
data whenever a map has BTF available (i.e. info->btf_id != 0)
regardless of json or plain-text output.

In do_dump(), the "int btf" is also renamed to "int do_plain_btf".
