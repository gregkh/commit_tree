ceph: fix mdsmap cluster available check based on laggy number

In case the max_mds > 1 in MDS cluster and there is no any standby
MDS and all the max_mds MDSs are in up:active state, if one of the
up:active MDSs is dead, the m->m_num_laggy in kclient will be 1.
Then the mount will fail without considering other healthy MDSs.

There manybe some MDSs still "in" the cluster but not in up:active
state, we will ignore them. Only when all the up:active MDSs in
the cluster are laggy will treat the cluster as not be available.

In case decreasing the max_mds, the cluster will not stop the extra
up:active MDSs immediately and there will be a latency. During it
the up:active MDS number will be larger than the max_mds, so later
the m_info memories will 100% be reallocated.

Here will pick out the up:active MDSs as the m_num_mds and allocate
the needed memories once.
