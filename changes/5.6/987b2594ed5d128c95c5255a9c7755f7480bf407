KVM: x86: Move kvm_vcpu_init() invocation to common code

Move the kvm_cpu_{un}init() calls to common x86 code as an intermediate
step to removing kvm_cpu_{un}init() altogether.

Note, VMX'x alloc_apic_access_page() and init_rmode_identity_map() are
per-VM allocations and are intentionally kept if vCPU creation fails.
They are freed by kvm_arch_destroy_vm().

No functional change intended.
