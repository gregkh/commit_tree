ASoC: stm32: Use managed buffer allocation

Clean up the drivers with the new managed buffer allocation API.
The superfluous snd_pcm_lib_malloc_pages() and
snd_pcm_lib_free_pages() calls are dropped, as well as the superfluous
snd_pcm_lib_preallocate_free_for_all() call.  As of the result,
hw_free and pcm_destruct ops became empty and got removed.
