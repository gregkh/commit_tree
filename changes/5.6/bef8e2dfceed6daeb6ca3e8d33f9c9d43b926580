MIPS: VPE: Fix a double free and a memory leak in 'release_vpe()'

Pointer on the memory allocated by 'alloc_progmem()' is stored in
'v->load_addr'. So this is this memory that should be freed by
'release_progmem()'.

'release_progmem()' is only a call to 'kfree()'.

With the current code, there is both a double free and a memory leak.
Fix it by passing the correct pointer to 'release_progmem()'.
