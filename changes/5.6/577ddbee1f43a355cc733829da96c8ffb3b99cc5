iwlwifi: d3: read all FW CPUs error info

Continue the wakeup flow only if no FW CPUs have an error

If we don't check for error in all FW CPUs the driver can think
based on one CPU that the FW is operational and try to access
and send commands.

Also, handle the error_id endianness correctly as le32
