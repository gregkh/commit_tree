perf arm-spe: Fix endless record after being terminated

In __cmd_record(), when receiving SIGINT(ctrl + c), a 'done' flag will
be set and the event list will be disabled by evlist__disable() once.

While in auxtrace_record.read_finish(), the related events will be
enabled again, if they are continuous, the recording seems to be
endless.

If the event is disabled, don't enable it again here.
