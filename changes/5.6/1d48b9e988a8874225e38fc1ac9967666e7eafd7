drm/udl: Allocate GEM object via struct drm_driver.gem_create_object

In preparation of a switch to SHMEM, udl now allocates its GEM
objects via struct drm_driver.gem_create_object. No functional
changes are made.

For SHMEM GEM objects, udl will require the use of a special mmap
function, which we set though the create-object function.
