io_uring: fix __io_iopoll_check deadlock in io_sq_thread

Since commit a3a0e43fd770 ("io_uring: don't enter poll loop if we have
CQEs pending"), if we already events pending, we won't enter poll loop.
In case SETUP_IOPOLL and SETUP_SQPOLL are both enabled, if app has
been terminated and don't reap pending events which are already in cq
ring, and there are some reqs in poll_list, io_sq_thread will enter
__io_iopoll_check(), and find pending events, then return, this loop
will never have a chance to exit.

I have seen this issue in fio stress tests, to fix this issue, let
io_sq_thread call io_iopoll_getevents() with argument 'min' being zero,
and remove __io_iopoll_check().
