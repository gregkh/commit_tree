x86/boot: Handle malformed SRAT tables during early ACPI parsing

Break an infinite loop when early parsing of the SRAT table is caused
by a subtable with zero length. Known to affect the ASUS WS X299 SAGE
motherboard with firmware version 1201 which has a large block of
zeros in its SRAT table. The kernel could boot successfully on this
board/firmware prior to the introduction of early parsing this table or
after a BIOS update.

 [ bp: Fixup whitespace damage and commit message. Make it return 0 to
   denote that there are no immovable regions because who knows what
   else is broken in this BIOS. ]
