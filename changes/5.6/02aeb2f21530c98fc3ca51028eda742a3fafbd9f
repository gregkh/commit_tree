pinctrl: sh-pfc: sh7269: Fix CAN function GPIOs

pinmux_func_gpios[] contains a hole due to the missing function GPIO
definition for the "CTX0&CTX1" signal, which is the logical "AND" of the
first two CAN outputs.

A closer look reveals other issues:
  - Some functionality is available on alternative pins, but the
    PINMUX_DATA() entries is using the wrong marks,
  - Several configurations are missing.

Fix this by:
  - Renaming CTX0CTX1CTX2_MARK, CRX0CRX1_PJ22_MARK, and
    CRX0CRX1CRX2_PJ20_MARK to CTX0_CTX1_CTX2_MARK, CRX0_CRX1_PJ22_MARK,
    resp. CRX0_CRX1_CRX2_PJ20_MARK for consistency with the
    corresponding enum IDs,
  - Adding all missing enum IDs and marks,
  - Use the right (*_PJ2x) variants for alternative pins,
  - Adding all missing configurations to pinmux_data[],
  - Adding all missing function GPIO definitions to pinmux_func_gpios[].
