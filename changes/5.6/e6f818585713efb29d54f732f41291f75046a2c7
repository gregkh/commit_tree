thunderbolt: Add support for USB 3.x tunnels

USB4 added a capability to tunnel USB 3.x protocol over the USB4
fabric. USB4 device routers may include integrated SuperSpeed HUB or a
function or both. USB tunneling follows PCIe so that the tunnel is
created between the parent and the child router from USB3 downstream
adapter port to USB3 upstream adapter port over a single USB4 link.

This adds support for USB 3.x tunneling and also capability to discover
existing USB 3.x tunnels (for example created by connection manager in
boot firmware).
