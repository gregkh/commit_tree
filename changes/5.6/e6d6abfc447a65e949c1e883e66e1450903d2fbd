perf report/top: Make 'e' visible in the help and make it toggle showing callchains

The 'e' and 'c' hotkeys were present for a long time, but not documented
in the help window, change 'e' to be a toggle so that it gets consistent
with other toggles like '+' and document it in the help window.

Keep 'c' as is for people used to it but don't document, as it is easier
to just use 'e' to show/hide all the callchains for a top level
histogram entry.
