ARM: dts: ux500: Add "simple-bus" compatible to soc node

The "soc" node in the Ux500 device tree does not need any special
handling - it is just a simple I/O bus that can be accessed without
additional configuration.

Therefore we can additionally describe it as compatible with "simple-bus".
This can be used by platforms to probe devices under the soc node without
special handling for our custom "stericsson,db8500" compatible
(e.g. in U-Boot).
