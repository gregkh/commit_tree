staging: android: ashmem: Disallow ashmem memory from being remapped

When ashmem file is mmapped, the resulting vma->vm_file points to the
backing shmem file with the generic fops that do not check ashmem
permissions like fops of ashmem do. If an mremap is done on the ashmem
region, then the permission checks will be skipped. Fix that by disallowing
mapping operation on the backing shmem file.
