firmware: qcom_scm-32: Use qcom_scm_desc in non-atomic calls

Use qcom_scm_desc in non-atomic calls to remove legacy convention
details from every SCM wrapper function. Implementations were copied
from qcom_scm-64 and are functionally equivalent when using the
qcom_scm_desc and qcom_scm_res structs.
