drm/i915/display: Add comment to a function that probably can be removed

This function is only called from port sync and it is identical to
what will be executed again in intel_update_crtc() over port sync
pipes.
If it is really necessary at least it deserves a better name and a
comment, leaving it to people working on port sync.
