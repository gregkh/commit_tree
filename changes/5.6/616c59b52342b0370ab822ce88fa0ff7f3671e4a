perf/x86: Provide stubs of KVM helpers for non-Intel CPUs

Provide stubs for perf_guest_get_msrs() and intel_pt_handle_vmx() when
building without support for Intel CPUs, i.e. CPU_SUP_INTEL=n.  Lack of
stubs is not currently a problem as the only user, KVM_INTEL, takes a
dependency on CPU_SUP_INTEL=y.  Provide the stubs for all CPUs so that
KVM_INTEL can be built for any CPU with compatible hardware support,
e.g. Centuar and Zhaoxin CPUs.

Note, the existing stub for perf_guest_get_msrs() is essentially dead
code as KVM selects CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS, i.e. the only user guarantees
the full implementation is built.
