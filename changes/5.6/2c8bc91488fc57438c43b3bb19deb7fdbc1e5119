drm/dp_mst: fix multiple frees of tx->bytes

Currently tx->bytes is being freed r->num_transactions number of
times because tx is not being set correctly. Fix this by setting
tx to &r->transactions[i] so that the correct objects are being
freed on each loop iteration.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Double free")
