gpio: bcm-kona: use platform_irq_count

platform_irq_count() is the more generic way (independent of
device trees) to determine the count of available interrupts. So
use this instead.

As platform_irq_count() might return an error code (which
of_irq_count doesn't) some additional handling is necessary.
