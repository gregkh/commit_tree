media: rc: ir-hix5hd2: add hi3796cv300-ir support

The IR device on Hi3796CV300 SoC is mostly same as hix5hd2, except the
following two things.

 - IR_CLK offset is 0x60 instead of 0x48.
 - It needs to set an extra bit in IR_ENABLE register to enable IR.

The following changes are made to deal with them.

 - Define a SoC specific data to accommodate IR_CLK offset and the flag
   telling requirement of extra enable bit.
 - Create function hix5hd2_ir_enable() to handle IR enabling. The original
   hix5hd2_ir_enable() is all about managing IR clock, so gets renamed
   to hix5hd2_ir_clk_enable().
 - Device table hix5hd2_ir_table[] gets moved forward, as it's being
   used by hix5hd2_ir_probe() now.
