reset: Align logic and flow in managed helpers

__devm_reset_control_get() and devm_reset_control_array_get() are very
similar, but they do not look similar, due to inverted logic.
Make them more similar, following the "bail out early" paradigm.

Adjust the logic and flow in devm_reset_controller_register() to match
the two other functions.
