staging: wfx: don't print useless error messages

During chip probing, if error does not come from secure boot (for
exemple when firmware has been found), others errors probably appears.

It is not necessary to say to user that the error does not come from
secure boot. So, drop the message saying "no error reported by secure
boot".

BTW, we take the opportunity to simplify print_boot_status().
