firmware: arm_scmi: Add support for multiple device per protocol

Currently only one scmi device is created for each protocol enumerated.
However, there is requirement to make use of some procotols by multiple
kernel subsystems/frameworks. One such example is SCMI PERFORMANCE
protocol which can be used by both cpufreq and devfreq drivers.
Similarly, SENSOR protocol may be used by hwmon and iio subsystems,
and POWER protocol may be used by genpd and regulator drivers.

In order to achieve that, let us extend the scmi bus to match based
not only protocol id but also the scmi device name if one is available.
