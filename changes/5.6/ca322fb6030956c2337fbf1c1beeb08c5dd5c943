ocfs2: make local header paths relative to C files

Gang He reports the failure of building fs/ocfs2/ as an external module
of the kernel installed on the system:

 $ cd fs/ocfs2
 $ make -C /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build M=`pwd` modules

If you want to make it work reliably, I'd recommend to remove ccflags-y
from the Makefiles, and to make header paths relative to the C files.  I
think this is the correct usage of the #include "..." directive.
