devlink: report 0 after hitting end in region read

commit fdd41ec21e15 ("devlink: Return right error code in case of errors
for region read") modified the region read code to report errors
properly in unexpected cases.

In the case where the start_offset and ret_offset match, it unilaterally
converted this into an error. This causes an issue for the "dump"
version of the command. In this case, the devlink region dump will
always report an invalid argument:

000000000000ffd0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
000000000000ffe0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff
devlink answers: Invalid argument
000000000000fff0 ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff ff

This occurs because the expected flow for the dump is to return 0 after
there is no further data.

The simplest fix would be to stop converting the error code to -EINVAL
if start_offset == ret_offset. However, avoid unnecessary work by
checking for when start_offset is larger than the region size and
returning 0 upfront.
