arm64: Ask the compiler to __always_inline functions used by KVM at HYP

KVM uses some of the static-inline helpers like icache_is_vipt() from
its HYP code. This assumes the function is inlined so that the code is
mapped to EL2. The compiler may decide not to inline these, and the
out-of-line version may not be in the __hyp_text section.

Add the additional __always_ hint to these static-inlines that are used
by KVM.
