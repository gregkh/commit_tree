io_uring: add non-vectored read/write commands

For uses cases that don't already naturally have an iovec, it's easier
(or more convenient) to just use a buffer address + length. This is
particular true if the use case is from languages that want to create
a memory safe abstraction on top of io_uring, and where introducing
the need for the iovec may impose an ownership issue. For those cases,
they currently need an indirection buffer, which means allocating data
just for this purpose.

Add basic read/write that don't require the iovec.
