mptcp: do not inherit inet proto ops

We need to initialise the struct ourselves, else we expose tcp-specific
callbacks such as tcp_splice_read which will then trigger splat because
the socket is an mptcp one:

BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in tcp_mstamp_refresh+0x80/0xa0 net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:57
Write of size 8 at addr ffff888116aa21d0 by task syz-executor.0/5478

CPU: 1 PID: 5478 Comm: syz-executor.0 Not tainted 5.5.0-rc6 #3
Call Trace:
 tcp_mstamp_refresh+0x80/0xa0 net/ipv4/tcp_output.c:57
 tcp_rcv_space_adjust+0x72/0x7f0 net/ipv4/tcp_input.c:612
 tcp_read_sock+0x622/0x990 net/ipv4/tcp.c:1674
 tcp_splice_read+0x20b/0xb40 net/ipv4/tcp.c:791
 do_splice+0x1259/0x1560 fs/splice.c:1205

To prevent build error with ipv6, add the recv/sendmsg function
declaration to ipv6.h.  The functions are already accessible "thanks"
to retpoline related work, but they are currently only made visible
by socket.c specific INDIRECT_CALLABLE macros.
