btrfs: limit max discard size for async discard

Throttle the maximum size of a discard so that we can provide an upper
bound for the rate of async discard. While the block layer is able to
split discards into the appropriate sized discards, we want to be able
to account more accurately the rate at which we are consuming NCQ slots
as well as limit the upper bound of work for a discard.
