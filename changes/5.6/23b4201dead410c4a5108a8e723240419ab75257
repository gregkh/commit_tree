net: hns3: fix VF VLAN table entries inconsistent issue

Currently, if VF is loaded on the host side, the host doesn't
clear the VF's VLAN table entries when VF removing. In this
case, when doing reset and disabling sriov at the same time the
VLAN device over VF will be removed, but the VLAN table entries
in hardware are remained.

This patch fixes it by asking PF to clear the VLAN table entries for
VF when VF is removing. It also clears the VLAN table full bit
after VF VLAN table entries being cleared.
