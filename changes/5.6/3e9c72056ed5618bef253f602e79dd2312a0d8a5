hv_utils: Support host-initiated restart request

The hv_utils driver currently supports a "shutdown" operation initiated
from the Hyper-V host. Newer versions of Hyper-V also support a "restart"
operation. So add support for the updated protocol version that has
"restart" support, and perform a clean reboot when such a message is
received from Hyper-V.

To test the restart functionality, run this PowerShell command on the
Hyper-V host:

Restart-VM  <vmname>  -Type Reboot
