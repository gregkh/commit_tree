scsi: lpfc: Fix disablement of FC-AL on lpe35000 models

The order of the flags/checks for adapters where FC-AL is supported
erroneously excluded lpe35000 adapter models.  Also noted that the G7 flags
for Loop and Persistent topology are incorrect. They should follow the
rules as G6.

Rework the logic to enable LPe35000 FC-AL support.  Collapse G7 support
logic to the same rules as G6.
