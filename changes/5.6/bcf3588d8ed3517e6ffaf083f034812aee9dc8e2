macintosh: windfarm: fix MODINFO regression

Commit af503716ac14 made sure OF devices get an OF style modalias with
I2C events. It assumed all in-tree users were converted, yet it missed
some Macintosh drivers.

Add an OF module device table for all windfarm drivers to make them
automatically load again.
