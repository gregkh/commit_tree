drm/i915: Support more QGV points

According to BSpec 53998, there is a mask of
max 8 SAGV/QGV points we need to support.

Bumping this up to keep the CI happy(currently
preventing tests to run), until all SAGV
changes land.

v2: Fix second plane where QGV points were
    hardcoded as well.

v3: Change the naming of I915_NUM_SAGV_POINTS
    to be I915_NUM_QGV_POINTS, as more meaningful
