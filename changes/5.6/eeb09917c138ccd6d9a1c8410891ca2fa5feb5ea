powerpc/mpc85xx: also write addr_h to spin table for 64bit boot entry

CPU like P4080 has 36bit physical address, its DDR physical
start address can be configured above 4G by LAW registers.

For such systems in which their physical memory start address was
configured higher than 4G, we need also to write addr_h into the spin
table of the target secondary CPU, so that addr_h and addr_l together
represent a 64bit physical address.
Otherwise the secondary core can not get correct entry to start from.
