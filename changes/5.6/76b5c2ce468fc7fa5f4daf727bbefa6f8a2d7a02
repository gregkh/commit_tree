staging: wfx: fix bss_loss

wfx_tx_confirm_cb()  retrieves the station associated with a frame using
the MAC address from the 802.11 header. In the other side wfx_tx()
retrieves the station using sta field from the ieee80211_tx_control
argument.

In wfx_cqm_bssloss_sm(), wfx_tx() was called directly without valid sta
field, but with a valid MAC address in 802.11 header. So there the
processing of this packet was unbalanced and may produce weird bugs.
