fm10k: use txqueue parameter in fm10k_tx_timeout

Make use of the new txqueue parameter to the .ndo_tx_timeout function.
In fm10k_tx_timeout, remove the now unnecessary loop to determine which
Tx queue is stuck. Instead, just double check the specified queue

This could be improved further to attempt resetting only the specific
queue that got stuck. However, that is a much larger refactor and has
been left as a future improvement.
