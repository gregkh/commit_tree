staging: wfx: simplify hif_set_data_filtering()

The structure hif_mib_set_data_filtering come from hardware API. It is
not intended to be manipulated in upper layers of the driver.

In add, current code for hif_set_data_filtering() is too dumb. It should
pack data with hardware representation instead of leaving all work to
the caller.
