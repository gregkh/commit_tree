drm: atmel-hlcdc: prefer a lower pixel-clock than requested

The intention was to only select a higher pixel-clock rate than the
requested, if a slight overclocking would result in a rate significantly
closer to the requested rate than if the conservative lower pixel-clock
rate is selected. The fixed patch has the logic the other way around and
actually prefers the higher frequency. Fix that.
