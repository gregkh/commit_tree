KVM: x86: Allocate vcpu struct in common x86 code

Move allocation of VMX and SVM vcpus to common x86.  Although the struct
being allocated is technically a VMX/SVM struct, it can be interpreted
directly as a 'struct kvm_vcpu' because of the pre-existing requirement
that 'struct kvm_vcpu' be located at offset zero of the arch/vendor vcpu
struct.

Remove the message from the build-time assertions regarding placement of
the struct, as compatibility with the arch usercopy region is no longer
the sole dependent on 'struct kvm_vcpu' being at offset zero.
