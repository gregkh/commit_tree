tools/power turbostat: Fix missing SYS_LPI counter on some Chromebooks

Some Chromebook BIOS' do not export an ACPI LPIT, which is how
Linux finds the residency counter for CPU and SYSTEM low power states,
that is exports in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpuidle/*residency_us

When these sysfs attributes are missing, check the debugfs attrubte
from the pmc_core driver, which accesses the same counter value.
