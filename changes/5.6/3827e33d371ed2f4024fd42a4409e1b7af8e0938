staging: wfx: workaround bug with "iw scan"

mac80211 specification does not forbid hw_scan() to call
ieee80211_scan_completed(). However, from userspace point of view, not
all applications support this behavior. In particular, the code of iw
contains a big fat warning:

   /*
    * This code has a bug, which requires creating a separate
    * nl80211 socket to fix:
    * It is possible for a NL80211_CMD_NEW_SCAN_RESULTS or
    * NL80211_CMD_SCAN_ABORTED message to be sent by the kernel
    * before (!) we listen to it, because we only start listening
    * after we send our scan request.
    [...]
    * Alas, the kernel doesn't do that (yet).
    */

So, we have to avoid to call ieee80211_scan_completed() from hw_scan()
(it's a kind of unwritten rule).

This patch relocates the hw_scan() process to a work_struct to fix the
problem.
