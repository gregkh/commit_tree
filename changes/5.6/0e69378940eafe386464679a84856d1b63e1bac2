crypto: atmel-{aes,sha} - Fix incorrect use of dmaengine_terminate_all()

device_terminate_all() is used to abort all the pending and
ongoing transfers on the channel, it should be used just in the
error path.

Also, dmaengine_terminate_all() is deprecated and one should use
dmaengine_terminate_async() or dmaengine_terminate_sync(). The method
is not used in atomic context, use dmaengine_terminate_sync().

A secondary aspect of this patch is that it luckily avoids a deadlock
between atmel_aes and at_hdmac.c. While in tasklet with the lock held,
the dma controller invokes the client callback (dmaengine_terminate_all),
which tries to get the same lock. The at_hdmac fix would be to drop the
lock before invoking the client callback, a fix on at_hdmac will follow.
