ata: ahci_brcm: Perform reset after obtaining resources

Resources such as clocks, PHYs, regulators are likely to get a probe
deferral return code, which could lead to the AHCI controller being
reset a few times until it gets successfully probed. Since this is
typically the most time consuming operation, move it after the resources
have been acquired.
