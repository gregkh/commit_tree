usb: musb: Add musb_clearb/w() interface

Delete the const attribute of addr parameter in readb/w/l hooks, these
changes are for implementing clearing W1C registers.
Replace musb_readb/w with musb_clearb/w to clear the interrupt status.

While at here, change some unsigned type to u32 to fix checkpatch.pl
warnings.
