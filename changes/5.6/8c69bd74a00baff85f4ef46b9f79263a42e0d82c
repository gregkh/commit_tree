drm/i915/guc: Remove function pointers for send/receive calls

Since we started using CT buffers on all gens, the function pointers can
only be set to either the _nop() or the _ct() functions. Since the
_nop() case applies to when the CT are disabled, we can just handle that
case in the _ct() functions and call them directly.

v2: keep intel_guc_send() and make the CT send/receive functions work on
    intel_guc_ct. (Michal)
