libbpf: Fix printf compilation warnings on ppc64le arch

On ppc64le __u64 and __s64 are defined as long int and unsigned long int,
respectively. This causes compiler to emit warning when %lld/%llu are used to
printf 64-bit numbers. Fix this by casting to size_t/ssize_t with %zu and %zd
format specifiers, respectively.

v1->v2:
- use size_t/ssize_t instead of custom typedefs (Martin).
