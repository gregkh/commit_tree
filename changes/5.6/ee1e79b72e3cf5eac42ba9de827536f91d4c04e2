ASoC: SOF: partition audio-related parts from SOF core

Move all the audio-specific code in the core,
audio-specific logic in the top-level PM callbacks
and the core header files into a separate file
(sof-audio.*) in preparation for adding an
audio client device.

In the process of moving all structure definitions
for widget, routes, pcm's etc, the snd_sof_dev
member in all these structs is replaced with
the snd_soc_component member. Also, use the component
device instead of the snd_sof_dev device wherever
possible in the PCM component driver,
control IO functions and the topology parser as the
component device will be moved over to the client
device later on.
