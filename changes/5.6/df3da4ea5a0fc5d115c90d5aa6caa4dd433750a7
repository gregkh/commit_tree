ext4: fix potential race between s_group_info online resizing and access

During an online resize an array of pointers to s_group_info gets replaced
so it can get enlarged. If there is a concurrent access to the array in
ext4_get_group_info() and this memory has been reused then this can lead to
an invalid memory access.
