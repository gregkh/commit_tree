soundwire: intel: report slave_ids for each link to SOF driver

The existing link_mask flag is no longer sufficient to detect the
hardware and identify which topology file and a machine driver to load.

By reporting the slave_ids exposed in ACPI tables, the parent SOF
driver will be able to compare against a set of static configurations.

This patch only adds the interface change, the functionality is added
in future patches.
