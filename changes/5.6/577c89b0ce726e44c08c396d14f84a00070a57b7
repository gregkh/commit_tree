media: v4l2-core: fix v4l2_buffer handling for time64 ABI

The v4l2_buffer structure contains a 'struct timeval' member that is
defined by the user space C library, creating an ABI incompatibility
when that gets updated to a 64-bit time_t.

As in v4l2_event, handle this with a special case in video_put_user()
and video_get_user() to replace the memcpy there.

Since the structure also contains a pointer, there are now two
native versions (on 32-bit systems) as well as two compat versions
(on 64-bit systems), which unfortunately complicates the compat
handler quite a bit.

Duplicating the existing handlers for the new types is a safe
conversion for now, but unfortunately this may turn into a
maintenance burden later. A larger-scale rework of the
compat code might be a better alternative, but is out of scope
of the y2038 work.

Sparc64 needs a special case because of their special suseconds_t
definition.
