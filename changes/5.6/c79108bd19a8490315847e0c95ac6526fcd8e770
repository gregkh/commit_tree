alarmtimer: Make alarmtimer platform device child of RTC device

The alarmtimer_suspend() function will fail if an RTC device is on a bus
such as SPI or i2c and that RTC device registers and probes after
alarmtimer_init() registers and probes the 'alarmtimer' platform device.

This is because system wide suspend suspends devices in the reverse order
of their probe. When alarmtimer_suspend() attempts to program the RTC for a
wakeup it will try to program an RTC device on a bus that has already been
suspended.

Move the alarmtimer device registration to happen when the RTC which is
used for wakeup is registered. Register the 'alarmtimer' platform device as
a child of the RTC device too, so that it can be guaranteed that the RTC
device won't be suspended when alarmtimer_suspend() is called.
