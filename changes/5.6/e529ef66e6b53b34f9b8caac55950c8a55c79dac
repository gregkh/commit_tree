KVM: Move vcpu alloc and init invocation to common code

Now that all architectures tightly couple vcpu allocation/free with the
mandatory calls to kvm_{un}init_vcpu(), move the sequences verbatim to
common KVM code.

Move both allocation and initialization in a single patch to eliminate
thrash in arch specific code.  The bisection benefits of moving the two
pieces in separate patches is marginal at best, whereas the odds of
introducing a transient arch specific bug are non-zero.
