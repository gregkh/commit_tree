media: dt-bindings: media: sun4i-csi: Add compatible for CSI0 on R40

The CSI0 block in the Allwinner R40 SoC looks to be the same as the one
in the A20. The register maps line up, and they support the same
features. The R40 appears to support BT.1120 based on the feature
overview, but it is not mentioned anywhere else. Also like the A20, the
ISP is not mentioned, but the CSI special clock needs to be enabled for
the hardware to function. The manual does state that the CSI special
clock is the TOP clock for all CSI hardware, but currently no hardware
exists for us to test if CSI1 also depends on it or not.

Add a compatible string for the CSI0 block in the R40, with the A20
compatible string as a fallback.
