btrfs: selftests: Add support for dummy devices

Add basic infrastructure to create and link dummy btrfs_devices. This
will be used in the pending btrfs_rmap_block test which deals with
the block groups.

Calling btrfs_alloc_dummy_device will link the newly created device to
the passed fs_info and the test framework will free them once the test
is finished.
