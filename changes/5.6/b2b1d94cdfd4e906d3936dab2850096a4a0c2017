x86/entry/64: Add instruction suffix to SYSRET

ignore_sysret() contains an unsuffixed SYSRET instruction. gas correctly
interprets this as SYSRETL, but leaving it up to gas to guess when there
is no register operand that implies a size is bad practice, and upstream
gas is likely to warn about this in the future. Use SYSRETL explicitly.
This does not change the assembled output.
