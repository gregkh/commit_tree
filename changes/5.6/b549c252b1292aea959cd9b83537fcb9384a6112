drm/i915/gvt: Fix orphan vgpu dmabuf_objs' lifetime

Deleting dmabuf item's list head after releasing its container can lead
to KASAN-reported issue:

  BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in __list_del_entry_valid+0x15/0xf0
  Read of size 8 at addr ffff88818a4598a8 by task kworker/u8:3/13119

So fix this issue by puting deleting dmabuf_objs ahead of releasing its
container.
