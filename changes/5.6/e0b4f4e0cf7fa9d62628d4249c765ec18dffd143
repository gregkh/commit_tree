watchdog: qcom: Use platform_get_irq_optional() for bark irq

platform_get_irq() prints an error message when the interrupt
is not available. So on platforms where bark interrupt is
not specified, following error message is observed on SDM845.

[    2.975888] qcom_wdt 17980000.watchdog: IRQ index 0 not found

This is also seen on SC7180, SM8150 SoCs as well.
Fix this by using platform_get_irq_optional() instead.
