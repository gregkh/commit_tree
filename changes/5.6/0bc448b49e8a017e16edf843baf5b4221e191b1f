mtd: maps: physmap: Add minimal Runtime PM support

Add minimal runtime PM support (enable on probe, disable on remove), to
ensure proper operation with a parent device that uses runtime PM.

This is needed on systems where the FLASH is connected to a bus
controller that is contained in a PM domain and/or has a gateable
functional clock.  In such cases, before accessing any device connected
to the external bus, the PM domain must be powered up, and/or the
functional clock must be enabled, which is typically handled through
runtime PM by the bus controller driver.

An example of this is the Renesas APE6-EVM development board, which has
an Ethernet controller and a CFI FLASH connected to the Bus State
Controller (BSC) of an R-Mobile APE6 SoC.
As long as the Ethernet driver, which had Runtime PM support since
commit 3a611e26e958b037 ("net/smsc911x: Add minimal runtime PM
support"), keeps the BSC powered, accessing the FLASH works.
When the ethernet node in r8a73a4-ape6evm.dts is disabled, the BSC is
never powered up, and the kernel crashes when trying to access the
FLASH:
