crypto: skcipher - Add skcipher_ialg_simple helper

This patch introduces the skcipher_ialg_simple helper which fetches
the crypto_alg structure from a simple skcipher instance's spawn.

This allows us to remove the third argument from the function
skcipher_alloc_instance_simple.

In doing so the reference count to the algorithm is now maintained
by the Crypto API and the caller no longer needs to drop the alg
refcount.
