drm: rcar-du: Add support for CMM

Add a driver for the R-Car Display Unit Color Correction Module.

In most of Gen3 SoCs, each DU output channel is provided with a CMM unit
to perform image enhancement and color correction.

Add support for CMM through a driver that supports configuration of
the 1-dimensional LUT table. More advanced CMM features will be
implemented on top of this initial one.
