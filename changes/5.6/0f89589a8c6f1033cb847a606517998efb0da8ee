Pass consistent param->type to fs_parse()

As it is, vfs_parse_fs_string() makes "foo" and "foo=" indistinguishable;
both get fs_value_is_string for ->type and NULL for ->string.  To make
it even more unpleasant, that combination is impossible to produce with
fsconfig().

Much saner rules would be
        "foo"           => fs_value_is_flag, NULL
	"foo="          => fs_value_is_string, ""
	"foo=bar"       => fs_value_is_string, "bar"
All cases are distinguishable, all results are expressable by fsconfig(),
->has_value checks are much simpler that way (to the point of the field
being useless) and quite a few regressions go away (gfs2 has no business
accepting -o nodebug=, for example).

Partially based upon patches from Miklos.
