powerpc/pci: Fix pcibios_setup_device() ordering

Move PCI device setup from pcibios_add_device() and pcibios_fixup_bus() to
pcibios_bus_add_device(). This ensures that platform-specific DMA and IOMMU
setup occurs after the device has been registered in sysfs, which is a
requirement for IOMMU group assignment to work

This fixes IOMMU group assignment for hotplugged devices on pseries, where
the existing behavior results in IOMMU assignment before registration.

Thanks to Lukas Wunner <lukas@wunner.de> for the suggestion.
