kbuild: do not create orphan built-in.a or obj-y objects

Both 'obj-y += foo/' and 'obj-m += foo/' request Kbuild to visit the
sub-directory foo/, but the difference is that only the former combines
foo/built-in.a into the built-in.a of the current directory because
everything in sub-directories visited by obj-m is supposed to be modular.

So, it makes sense to create built-in.a only if that sub-directory is
reachable by the chain of obj-y. Otherwise, built-in.a will not be
linked into vmlinux anyway. For the same reason, it is pointless to
compile obj-y objects in the directory visited by obj-m.
