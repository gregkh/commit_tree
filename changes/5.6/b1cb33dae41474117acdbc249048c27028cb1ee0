platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Clean up: Remove comma after the termination line

It is common practice to place a comma after the last entry in an
initialized array to avoid the need to add one in future patches that
extend the array. But when the last element is a termination marker, the
comma could be harmful. Any new entries must be added before the
terminator (and the comma would prevent the compiler from issuing a
warning about an entry after the terminator).
