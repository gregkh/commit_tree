Revert "tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: drop EARLYCON_DECLARE"

This reverts commit a659652f6169240a5818cb244b280c5a362ef5a4.

This broke the earlycon on LS1021A processors because the order of the
earlycon_setup() functions were changed. Before the commit the normal
lpuart32_early_console_setup() was called. After the commit the
lpuart32_imx_early_console_setup() is called instead.
