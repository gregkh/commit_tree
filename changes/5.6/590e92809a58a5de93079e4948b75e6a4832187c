firmware: qcom_scm-32: Move SMCCC register filling to qcom_scm_call

Move SMCCC register filling to qcom_scm_call so that __scm_legacy_do
only needs to concern itself with retry mechanism. qcom_scm_call then is
responsible for translating qcom_scm_desc into the complete set of
register arguments and passing onto qcom_scm_call_do.
