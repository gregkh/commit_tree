drm/amd/display: reallocate MST payload when link loss

[Why]
Try to allocate MST payload but receive HPD short pulse with link loss
casue driver allocate payload twice. It cause monitor can't light up

[How]
When driver receive HPD short pulse with link loss, we need to
deallocate payload then allocate payload.
Then we will not allocate payload twice with same sink.
