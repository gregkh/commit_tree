btrfs: make btrfs_ordered_extent naming consistent with btrfs_file_extent_item

ordered->start, ordered->len, and ordered->disk_len correspond to
fi->disk_bytenr, fi->num_bytes, and fi->disk_num_bytes, respectively.
It's confusing to translate between the two naming schemes. Since a
btrfs_ordered_extent is basically a pending btrfs_file_extent_item,
let's make the former use the naming from the latter.

Note that I didn't touch the names in tracepoints just in case there are
scripts depending on the current naming.
