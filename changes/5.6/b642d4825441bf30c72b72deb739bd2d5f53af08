ARM: dts: sun8i-a83t-tbs-a711: Fix USB OTG mode detection

USB-ID signal has a pullup on the schematic, but in reality it's not
pulled up, so add a GPIO pullup. And we also need a usb0_vbus_power-supply
for VBUS detection.

This fixes OTG mode detection and charging issues on TBS A711 tablet.
The issues came from ID pin reading 0, causing host mode to be enabled,
when it should not be, leading to DRVVBUS being enabled, which disabled
the charger.
