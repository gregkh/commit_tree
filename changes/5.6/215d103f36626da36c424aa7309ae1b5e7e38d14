ARM: dts: dra7: add cam clkctrl node

Add clkctrl nodes for CAM domain.

Note that because of the current dts node name dependency for mapping to
clock domain, we must still use "cam-clkctrl@" naming instead of generic
"clock@" naming for the node. And because of this, it's probably best to
apply the dts node addition together along with the other clock changes.
