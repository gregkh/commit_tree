powerpc/44x: Adjust indentation in ibm4xx_denali_fixup_memsize

Clang warns:

../arch/powerpc/boot/4xx.c:231:3: warning: misleading indentation;
statement is not part of the previous 'else' [-Wmisleading-indentation]
        val = SDRAM0_READ(DDR0_42);
        ^
../arch/powerpc/boot/4xx.c:227:2: note: previous statement is here
        else
        ^

This is because there is a space at the beginning of this line; remove
it so that the indentation is consistent according to the Linux kernel
coding style and clang no longer warns.
