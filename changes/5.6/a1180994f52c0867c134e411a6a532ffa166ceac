ext4: remove redundant S_ISREG() checks from ext4_fallocate()

ext4_fallocate() is only used in the file_operations for regular files.
Also, the VFS only allows fallocate() on regular files and block
devices, but block devices always use blkdev_fallocate().  For both of
these reasons, S_ISREG() is always true in ext4_fallocate().

Therefore the S_ISREG() checks in ext4_zero_range(),
ext4_collapse_range(), ext4_insert_range(), and ext4_punch_hole() are
redundant.  Remove them.
