staging: wfx: revert unexpected change in debugfs output

It appears that commit 8c7128c4cf4e ("staging: align to fix warnings of
line over 80 characters") do slightly more than what is explained in
commit log.

Especially, it changes the output of the file rx_stats from debugfs.
From some point of view, this file can be considered as a part of the
API. Any change on it should be clearly announced.

Since the change introduced does not seems to have any justification,
revert it.
