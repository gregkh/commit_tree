KVM: s390: do not clobber registers during guest reset/store status

The initial CPU reset clobbers the userspace fpc and the store status
ioctl clobbers the guest acrs + fpr.  As these calls are only done via
ioctl (and not via vcpu_run), no CPU context is loaded, so we can (and
must) act directly on the sync regs, not on the thread context.
