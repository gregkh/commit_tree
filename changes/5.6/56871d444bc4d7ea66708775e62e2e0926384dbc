KVM: x86: fix overlap between SPTE_MMIO_MASK and generation

The SPTE_MMIO_MASK overlaps with the bits used to track MMIO
generation number.  A high enough generation number would overwrite the
SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK region and cause the MMIO SPTE to be misinterpreted.

Likewise, setting bits 52 and 53 would also cause an incorrect generation
number to be read from the PTE, though this was partially mitigated by the
(useless if it weren't for the bug) removal of SPTE_SPECIAL_MASK from
the spte in get_mmio_spte_generation.  Drop that removal, and replace
it with a compile-time assertion.
