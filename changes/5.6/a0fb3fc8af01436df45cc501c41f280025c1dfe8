mmc: renesas_sdhi: remove whitelist for internal DMAC

We know now that there won't be Gen3 SoCs with both, SYS-DMAC and
internal DMAC. We removed the blacklisting for SYS-DMAC already, so we
can remove the whitelisting for internal DMAC, too. This makes adding
new SoCs easier. We keep the quirk handling, of course.
