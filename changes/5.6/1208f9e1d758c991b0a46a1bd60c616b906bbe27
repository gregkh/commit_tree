USB: hub: Fix the broken detection of USB3 device in SMSC hub

Renesas R-Car H3ULCB + Kingfisher Infotainment Board is either not able
to detect the USB3.0 mass storage devices or is detecting those as
USB2.0 high speed devices.

The explanation given by Renesas is that, due to a HW issue, the XHCI
driver does not wake up after going to sleep on connecting a USB3.0
device.

In order to mitigate that, disable the auto-suspend feature
specifically for SMSC hubs from hub_probe() function, as a quirk.

Renesas Kingfisher Infotainment Board has two USB3.0 ports (CN2) which
are connected via USB5534B 4-port SuperSpeed/Hi-Speed, low-power,
configurable hub controller.
