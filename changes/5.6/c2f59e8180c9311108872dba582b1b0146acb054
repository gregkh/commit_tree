ARM: dts: qcom: Correct USB3503 GPIOs polarity

Current USB3503 driver ignores GPIO polarity and always operates as if the
GPIO lines were flagged as ACTIVE_HIGH. Fix the polarity for the existing
USB3503 chip applications to match the chip specification and common
convention for naming the pins. The only pin, which has to be ACTIVE_LOW
is the reset pin. The remaining are ACTIVE_HIGH. This change allows later
to fix the USB3503 driver to properly use generic GPIO bindings and read
polarity from DT.
