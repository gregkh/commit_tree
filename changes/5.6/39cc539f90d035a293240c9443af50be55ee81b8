driver core: platform: Prevent resouce overflow from causing infinite loops

num_resources in the platform_device struct is declared as a u32.  The
for loops that iterate over num_resources use an int as the counter,
which can cause infinite loops on architectures with smaller ints.
Change the loop counters to u32.
