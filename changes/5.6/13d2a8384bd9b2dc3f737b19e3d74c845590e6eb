IB/hfi1: Decouple IRQ name from type

IRQ name was connected to IRQ type, this is not sufficient and it would be
better to use name as argument to msix_request_irq instead of assigning it
to variables when function is called.

Index argument was required to generate name and now it can be removed.

To generate name correctly helpers function were added and updated.
