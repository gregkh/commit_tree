drivers: watchdog: stm32_iwdg: set WDOG_HW_RUNNING at probe

If the watchdog hardware is already enabled during the boot process,
when the Linux watchdog driver loads, it should start/reset the watchdog
and tell the watchdog framework. As a result, ping can be generated from
the watchdog framework (if CONFIG_WATCHDOG_HANDLE_BOOT_ENABLED is set),
until the userspace watchdog daemon takes over control
