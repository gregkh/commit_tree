powerpc/pci: Remove pcibios_setup_bus_devices()

With the previous patch applied pcibios_setup_device() will always be run
when pcibios_bus_add_device() is called. There are several code paths where
pcibios_setup_bus_device() is still called (the PowerPC specific PCI
hotplug support is one) so with just the previous patch applied the setup
can be run multiple times on a device, once before the device is added
to the bus and once after.

There's no need to run the setup in the early case any more so just
remove it entirely.
