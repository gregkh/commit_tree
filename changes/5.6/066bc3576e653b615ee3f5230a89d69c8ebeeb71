powerpc/xmon: Fix whitespace handling in getstring()

The ls (lookup symbol) and zr (reboot) commands use xmon's getstring()
helper to read a string argument from the xmon prompt. This function
skips over leading whitespace, but doesn't check if the first
"non-whitespace" character is a newline which causes some odd
behaviour (<enter> indicates a the enter key was pressed):

  0:mon> ls printk<enter>
  printk: c0000000001680c4

  0:mon> ls<enter>
  printk<enter>
  Symbol '
  printk' not found.
  0:mon>

With commit 2d9b332d99b ("powerpc/xmon: Allow passing an argument to
ppc_md.restart()") we have a similar problem with the zr command.
Previously zr took no arguments so "zr<enter> would trigger a reboot.
With that patch applied a second newline needs to be sent in order for
the reboot to occur. Fix this by checking if the leading whitespace
ended on a newline:

  0:mon> ls<enter>
  Symbol '' not found.
