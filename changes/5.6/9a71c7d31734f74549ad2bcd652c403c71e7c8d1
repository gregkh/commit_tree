drm/amd/display: Register DMUB service with DC

[Why]
DC can utilize the DMUB server to send commands to the DMUB but it's
the DM responsibility to pass it the service to use.

[How]
Create the dc_dmub_srv after we finish initializing the dmub_srv.
Cleanup the dc_dmub_srv before destroying the dmub_srv or dc.
