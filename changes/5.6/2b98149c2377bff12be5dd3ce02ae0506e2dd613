namei: only return -ECHILD from follow_dotdot_rcu()

It's over-zealous to return hard errors under RCU-walk here, given that
a REF-walk will be triggered for all other cases handling ".." under
RCU.

The original purpose of this check was to ensure that if a rename occurs
such that a directory is moved outside of the bind-mount which the
resolution started in, it would be detected and blocked to avoid being
able to mess with paths outside of the bind-mount. However, triggering a
new REF-walk is just as effective a solution.
