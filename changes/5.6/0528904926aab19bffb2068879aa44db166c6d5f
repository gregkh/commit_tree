ACPI: button: Add DMI quirk for Razer Blade Stealth 13 late 2019 lid switch

Running evemu-record on the lid switch event shows that the lid reports
the first "close" but then never reports an "open".  This causes systemd
to continuously re-suspend the laptop every 30s.  Resetting the _LID to
"open" fixes the issue.
