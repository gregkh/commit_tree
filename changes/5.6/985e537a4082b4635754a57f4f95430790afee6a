x86/ioremap: Map EFI runtime services data as encrypted for SEV

The dmidecode program fails to properly decode the SMBIOS data supplied
by OVMF/UEFI when running in an SEV guest. The SMBIOS area, under SEV, is
encrypted and resides in reserved memory that is marked as EFI runtime
services data.

As a result, when memremap() is attempted for the SMBIOS data, it
can't be mapped as regular RAM (through try_ram_remap()) and, since
the address isn't part of the iomem resources list, it isn't mapped
encrypted through the fallback ioremap().

Add a new __ioremap_check_other() to deal with memory types like
EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES_DATA which are not covered by the resource ranges.

This allows any runtime services data which has been created encrypted,
to be mapped encrypted too.
