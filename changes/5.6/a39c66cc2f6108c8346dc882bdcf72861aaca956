crypto: shash - convert shash_free_instance() to new style

Convert shash_free_instance() and its users to the new way of freeing
instances, where a ->free() method is installed to the instance struct
itself.  This replaces the weakly-typed method crypto_template::free().

This will allow removing support for the old way of freeing instances.

Also give shash_free_instance() a more descriptive name to reflect that
it's only for instances with a single spawn, not for any instance.
