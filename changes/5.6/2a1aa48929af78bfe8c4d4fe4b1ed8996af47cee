nfsd: pass a 64-bit guardtime to nfsd_setattr()

Guardtime handling in nfs3 differs between 32-bit and 64-bit
architectures, and uses the deprecated time_t type.

Change it to using time64_t, which behaves the same way on
64-bit and 32-bit architectures, treating the number as an
unsigned 32-bit entity with a range of year 1970 to 2106
consistently, and avoiding the y2038 overflow.
