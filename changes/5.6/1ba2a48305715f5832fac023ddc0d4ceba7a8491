drm/amd/display: Disable chroma viewport w/a when rotated 180 degrees

[WHY]
Previous Renoir chroma viewport workaround fixed an MPO flicker by
increasing the chroma viewport size. However, when the MPO plane is
rotated 180 degrees, the viewport is read in reverse. Since the workaround
increases viewport size, when reading in reverse it causes a vertical
chroma offset.

[HOW]
Pass rotation value to viewport set functions
Temporarily disable the chroma viewport w/a when hubp is rotated 180 degrees
