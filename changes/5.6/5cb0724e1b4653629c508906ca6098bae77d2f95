btrfs: only keep track of data extents for async discard

As mentioned earlier, discarding data can be done either by issuing an
explicit discard or implicitly by reusing the LBA. Metadata block_groups
see much more frequent reuse due to well it being metadata. So instead
of explicitly discarding metadata block_groups, just leave them be and
let the latter implicit discarding be done for them.

For mixed block_groups, block_groups which contain both metadata and
data, we let them be as higher fragmentation is expected.
