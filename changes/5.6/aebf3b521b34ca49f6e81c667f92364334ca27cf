drm/i915/pmu: Do not use colons or dashes in PMU names

We use PCI device path in the registered PMU name in order to distinguish
between multiple GPUs. But since tools/perf reserves a special meaning to
dash and colon characters we need to transliterate them to something else.
We choose an underscore.

v2:
 * Use strreplace. (Chris)
 * Dashes are not good either. (Chris)
