dmaengine: ti: omap-dma: Add device tree match data and use it for cpu_pm

With old DMA code disabled for handling DMA requests for device tree based
SoCs, we can move omap3 specific context save and restore to the dmaengine
driver.

Let's do this by adding cpu_pm notifier handling to save and restore context,
and enable it based on device tree match data. This way we can use the match
data later to configure more SoC specific features later on too.

Note that we only clear the channels in use while the platform code also
clears reserved channels 0 and 1 on high-security SoCs. Based on testing
on n900, this is not needed though and the system idles just fine.

With the dmaengine driver handling context save and restore, we must now
remove the old custom calls for context save and restore.
