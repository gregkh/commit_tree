libbpf,selftests/bpf: Fix clean targets

Libbpf's clean target should clean out generated files in $(OUTPUT) directory
and not make assumption that $(OUTPUT) directory is current working directory.

Selftest's Makefile should delegate cleaning of libbpf-generated files to
libbpf's Makefile. This ensures more robust clean up.
