drop_monitor: Do not cancel uninitialized work item

Drop monitor uses a work item that takes care of constructing and
sending netlink notifications to user space. In case drop monitor never
started to monitor, then the work item is uninitialized and not
associated with a function.

Therefore, a stop command from user space results in canceling an
uninitialized work item which leads to the following warning [1].

Fix this by not processing a stop command if drop monitor is not
currently monitoring.
