net: ip_gre: Separate ERSPAN newlink / changelink callbacks

ERSPAN shares most of the code path with GRE and gretap code. While that
helps keep the code compact, it is also error prone. Currently a broken
userspace can turn a gretap tunnel into a de facto ERSPAN one by passing
IFLA_GRE_ERSPAN_VER. There has been a similar issue in ip6gretap in the
past.

To prevent these problems in future, split the newlink and changelink code
paths. Split the ERSPAN code out of ipgre_netlink_parms() into a new
function erspan_netlink_parms(). Extract a piece of common logic from
ipgre_newlink() and ipgre_changelink() into ipgre_newlink_encap_setup().
Add erspan_newlink() and erspan_changelink().
