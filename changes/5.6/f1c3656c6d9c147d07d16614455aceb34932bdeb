selftests/bpf: Skip perf hw events test if the setup disabled it

The same with commit 4e59afbbed96 ("selftests/bpf: skip nmi test when perf
hw events are disabled"), it would make more sense to skip the
test_stacktrace_build_id_nmi test if the setup (e.g. virtual machines) has
disabled hardware perf events.
