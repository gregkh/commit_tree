bpftool: Match programs by name

When working with frequently modified BPF programs, both the ID and the
tag may change.  bpftool currently doesn't provide a "stable" way to match
such programs.

This patch implements lookup by name for programs.  The show and dump
commands will return all programs with the given name, whereas other
commands will error out if several programs have the same name.
