iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Prepare for TTBR1 usage

Now that we can correctly extract top-level indices without relying on
the remaining upper bits being zero, the only remaining impediments to
using a given table for TTBR1 are the address validation on map/unmap
and the awkward TCR translation granule format. Add a quirk so that we
can do the right thing at those points.
