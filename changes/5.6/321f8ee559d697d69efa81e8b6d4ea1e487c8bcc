KVM: s390: Move guts of kvm_arch_vcpu_init() into kvm_arch_vcpu_create()

Move all of kvm_arch_vcpu_init(), which is invoked at the very end of
kvm_vcpu_init(), into kvm_arch_vcpu_create() in preparation of moving
the call to kvm_vcpu_init().  Moving kvm_vcpu_init() is itself a
preparatory step for moving allocation and initialization to common KVM
code.

No functional change inteded.
