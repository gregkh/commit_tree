drm/modes: parse_cmdline: Explicitly memset the passed in drm_cmdline_mode struct

Instead of only setting mode->specified on false on an early exit and
leaving e.g. mode->bpp_specified and mode->refresh_specified as is,
lets be consistent and just zero out the entire passed in struct at
the top of drm_mode_parse_command_line_for_connector()

Changes in v3:
-Drop "mode->specified = false;" line instead of the "return false;" (oops)
