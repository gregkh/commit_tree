drm/xen: Simplify fb_create

The current code is a pretty good wtf moment, since we drop the
reference before we use it. It's not a big deal, because a) we only
use the pointer, so doesn't blow up and the real reason b) fb->obj[0]
already holds a full reference for us.

Might as well take the real pointer ins't of complicated games that
baffle.
