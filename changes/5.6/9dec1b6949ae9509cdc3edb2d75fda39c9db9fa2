sched/cputime: move rq parameter in irqtime_account_process_tick

Every time we call irqtime_account_process_tick() is in a interrupt,
Every caller will get and assign a parameter rq = this_rq(), This is
unnecessary and increase the code size a little bit. Move the rq getting
action to irqtime_account_process_tick internally is better.
