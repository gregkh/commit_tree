netfilter: flowtable: Fix flushing of offloaded flows on free

Freeing a flowtable with offloaded flows, the flow are deleted from
hardware but are not deleted from the flow table, leaking them,
and leaving their offload bit on.

Add a second pass of the disabled gc to delete the these flows from
the flow table before freeing it.
