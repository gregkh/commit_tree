netfilter: flowtable: skip offload setup if disabled

nftables test case
tests/shell/testcases/flowtable/0001flowtable_0

results in a crash. After the refactor, if we leave early via
nf_flowtable_hw_offload(), then "struct flow_block_offload" is left
in an uninitialized state, but later users assume its initialised.
