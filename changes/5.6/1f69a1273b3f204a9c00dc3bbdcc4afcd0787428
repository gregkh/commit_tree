tty: serial: tegra: Handle RX transfer in PIO mode if DMA wasn't started

It is possible to get an instant RX timeout or end-of-transfer interrupt
before RX DMA was started, if transaction is less than 16 bytes. Transfer
should be handled in PIO mode in this case because DMA can't handle it.
This patch brings back the original behaviour of the driver that was
changed by accident by a previous commit, it fixes occasional Bluetooth HW
initialization failures which I started to notice recently.
