xdp: Make cpumap flush_list common for all map instances

The cpumap flush list is used to track entries that need to flushed
from via the xdp_do_flush_map() function. This list used to be
per-map, but there is really no reason for that. Instead make the
flush list global for all devmaps, which simplifies __cpu_map_flush()
and cpu_map_alloc().
