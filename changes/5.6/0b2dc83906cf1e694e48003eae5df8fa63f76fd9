bpf, sockhash: Synchronize_rcu before free'ing map

We need to have a synchronize_rcu before free'ing the sockhash because any
outstanding psock references will have a pointer to the map and when they
use it, this could trigger a use after free.

This is a sister fix for sockhash, following commit 2bb90e5cc90e ("bpf:
sockmap, synchronize_rcu before free'ing map") which addressed sockmap,
which comes from a manual audit.
