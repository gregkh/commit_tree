ALSA: oxfw: don't add MIDI/PCM interface when packet streaming is unavailable

Stanton SCS.1d doesn't support packet streaming even if it has plugs for
isochronous communication.

This commit is a preparation for this case. The 'has_input' member is
added to specific structure, and MIDI/PCM interfaces are not added when
the member is false.
