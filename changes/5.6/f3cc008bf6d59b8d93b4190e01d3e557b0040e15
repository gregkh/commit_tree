sxgbe: Fix off by one in samsung driver strncpy size arg

This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in
drivers/net/ethernet/samsung/sxgbe/sxgbe_main.c. The issue is that in:

        strncmp(opt, "eee_timer:", 6)

the passed string literal: "eee_timer:" has 10 bytes (without the NULL
byte) and the passed size argument is 6. As a result, the logic will
also accept other, malformed strings, e.g. "eee_tiXXX:".

This bug doesn't seem to have any security impact since its present in
module's cmdline parsing code.
