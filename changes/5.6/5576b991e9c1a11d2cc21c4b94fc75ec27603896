bpf: Add BPF_FUNC_jiffies64

This patch adds a helper to read the 64bit jiffies.  It will be used
in a later patch to implement the bpf_cubic.c.

The helper is inlined for jit_requested and 64 BITS_PER_LONG
as the map_gen_lookup().  Other cases could be considered together
with map_gen_lookup() if needed.
