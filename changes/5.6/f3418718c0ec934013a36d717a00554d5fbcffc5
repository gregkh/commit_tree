mtd: spi-nor: Add support for w25q32jwm

Add support for the Winbond W25Q32JW-xM flashes. These have a
programmable QE bit. There is also the W25Q32JW-xQ variant which shares
the ID with the W25Q32DW and W25Q32FW parts. The W25Q32JW-xQ has the QE
bit hard strapped to 1, thus don't support the /HOLD and /WP pins.

This was tested in single, dual and quad mode on a custom board with the
NXP FlexSPI controller. Also the BP bits as well as the TB bit were
tested.
