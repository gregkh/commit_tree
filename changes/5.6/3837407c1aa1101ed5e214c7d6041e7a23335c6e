KVM: arm64: pmu: Don't increment SW_INCR if PMCR.E is unset

The specification says PMSWINC increments PMEVCNTR<n>_EL1 by 1
if PMEVCNTR<n>_EL0 is enabled and configured to count SW_INCR.

For PMEVCNTR<n>_EL0 to be enabled, we need both PMCNTENSET to
be set for the corresponding event counter but we also need
the PMCR.E bit to be set.
