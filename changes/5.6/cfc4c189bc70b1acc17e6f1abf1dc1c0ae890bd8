pwm: Read initial hardware state at request time

Drivers that support reading the hardware state (using ->get_state())
may want to rely on per-PWM data to do so. Defer reading the hardware
state for the first time until the PWM has been requested and after
drivers have had a chance to allocate per-PWM data.

Conceptually this is also a more natural place to read the hardware
state because the PWM core doesn't need to know the hardware state of a
PWM unless there is a user for it. This also ensures that the state is
read everytime a user requests a PWM. If the PWM changes between users
for some reason, the PWM core will reload the state from hardware and
keep its copy of the state up-to-date.
