devlink: Add health recover notifications on devlink flows

Devlink health recover notifications were added only on driver direct
updates of health_state through devlink_health_reporter_state_update().
Add notifications on updates of health_state by devlink flows of report
and recover.

Moved functions devlink_nl_health_reporter_fill() and
devlink_recover_notify() to avoid forward declaration.
