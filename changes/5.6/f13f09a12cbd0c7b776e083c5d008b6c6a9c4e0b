virtio_ring: Fix mem leak with vring_new_virtqueue()

The functions vring_new_virtqueue() and __vring_new_virtqueue() are used
with split rings, and any allocations within these functions are managed
outside of the .we_own_ring flag. The commit cbeedb72b97a ("virtio_ring:
allocate desc state for split ring separately") allocates the desc state
within the __vring_new_virtqueue() but frees it only when the .we_own_ring
flag is set. This leads to a memory leak when freeing such allocated
virtqueues with the vring_del_virtqueue() function.

Fix this by moving the desc_state free code outside the flag and only
for split rings. Issue was discovered during testing with remoteproc
and virtio_rpmsg.
