perf/imx_ddr: Fix cpu hotplug state cleanup

This driver allocates a dynamic cpu hotplug state but never releases it.
If reloaded in a loop it will quickly trigger a WARN message:

	"No more dynamic states available for CPU hotplug"

Fix by calling cpuhp_remove_multi_state on remove like several other
perf pmu drivers.

Also fix the cleanup logic on probe error paths: add the missing
cpuhp_remove_multi_state call and properly check the return value from
cpuhp_state_add_instant_nocalls.
