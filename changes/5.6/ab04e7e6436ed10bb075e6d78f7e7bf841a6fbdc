media: atmel: atmel-isc-base: add support for Y10 format

The ISC can receive input from sensors using Y10 format directly
(10 bits greyscale). In this case, the ISC must dump the data directly,
either as GREY (8bit) or Y10 (10bit).
Y16 is not supported because we cannot align the MSB 10 bits to the MSB
inside the 16bit container.
For this format, the ISC internal pipeline cannot work (only works with
BAYER), so we must dump the data directly as 8bit/10bit.
