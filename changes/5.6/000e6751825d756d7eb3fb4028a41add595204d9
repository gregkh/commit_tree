media: dvb-core: Fix receiving invalid EIT-sections

Resetting buf without resetting pusi_seen at a channel-switch can lead
to copying the rest of a section to the start of buf, but treating it as
a complete section, when the next pusi arrives.
EIT-sections starting without valid header were randomly received during
an EIT-scan on a transponder.
