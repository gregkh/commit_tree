drm/i915/gt: Pull GT initialisation under intel_gt_init()

Begin pulling the GT setup underneath a single GT umbrella; let intel_gt
take ownership of its engines! As hinted, the complication is the
lifetime of the probed engine versus the active lifetime of the GT
backends. We need to detect the engine layout early and keep it until
the end so that we can sanitize state on takeover and release.
