ice: Restore interrupt throttle settings after VSI rebuild

After each rebuild driver deallocates q_vectors, so the interrupt
throttle rate (ITR) settings get lost.

Create a function to save and restore ITR for each queue. If a user
increases the number of queues, restore all the previous queue
settings for each existing queue, and the additional queues will
get the default setting.
