drm/i915/display: Force the state compute phase once to enable PSR

Recent improvements in the state tracking in i915 caused PSR to not be
enabled when reusing firmware/BIOS modeset, this is due to all initial
commits returning ealier in intel_atomic_check() as needs_modeset()
is always false.

To fix that here forcing the state compute phase in CRTC that is
driving the eDP that supports PSR once. Enable or disable PSR do not
require a fullmodeset, so user will still experience glitch free boot
process plus the power savings that PSR brings.

It was tried to set mode_changed in intel_initial_commit() but at
this point the connectors are not registered causing a crash when
computing encoder state.

v2:
- removed function return
- change arguments to match intel_hdcp_atomic_check

v3:
- replaced drm includes in intel_psr.h by forward declaration(Jani)
