soc: fsl: qe: use qe_ic_cascade_{low, high}_mpic also on 83xx

The *_ipic and *_mpic handlers are almost identical - the only
difference is that the latter end with an unconditional
chip->irq_eoi() call. Since IPIC does not have ->irq_eoi, we can
reduce some code duplication by calling irq_eoi conditionally.

This is similar to what is already done in mpc8xxx_gpio_irq_cascade().

This leaves the functions slightly misnamed, but that will be fixed in
a subsequent patch.
