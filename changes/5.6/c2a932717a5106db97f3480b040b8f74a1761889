HID: logitech-hidpp: Support translations from short to long reports

This patch allows short reports to be translated into long reports.

hidpp_validate_device now returns a u8 instead of a bool which represents
the supported reports. The corresponding bits (i.e.
HIDPP_REPORT_*_SUPPORTED) are set if an HID++ report is supported.

If a short report is being sent and the device does not support it, it is
instead sent as a long report.

This patch also introduces support for the MX Master (b01e and b012).
