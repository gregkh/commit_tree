staging: rtl8188eu: Remove some unneeded goto statements

In routines rtw_hostapd_ioctl() and wpa_supplicant_ioctl(), several
error conditions involve setting a variable indicating the error,
followed by a goto. The code following the target of that goto merely
returns the value. It is simpler, therefore to return the error value
immediately, and eliminate the got  target.
