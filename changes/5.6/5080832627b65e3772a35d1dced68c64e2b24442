NFC: pn544: Adjust indentation in pn544_hci_check_presence

Clang warns

../drivers/nfc/pn544/pn544.c:696:4: warning: misleading indentation;
statement is not part of the previous 'if' [-Wmisleading-indentation]
                 return nfc_hci_send_cmd(hdev, NFC_HCI_RF_READER_A_GATE,
                 ^

                ^

This warning occurs because there is a space after the tab on this line.
Remove it so that the indentation is consistent with the Linux kernel
coding style and clang no longer warns.
