drm/i915/fbc: Start using flip nuke

The hardware automagically nukes the cfb on flip. We can use
that whenever the plane/crtc configuration doesn't change too
much. Let's hook that up.

We'll need this for glk+ since we need to introduce an extra
vblank wait after FBC disable. As we're currently disabling
FBC around all plane updates we'd slow them down by an extra
frame. Not a great user experience when your fps is always
capped at vrefres/2. With flip nuke we don't need the extra
vblank wait.
