scsi: ufs: Add max_lu_supported in struct ufs_dev_info

Add one new parameter max_lu_supported in struct ufs_dev_info, which will
be used to express exactly how many general LUs being supported by UFS
device, and initialize it during booting stage.  This patch also adds a new
function ufshcd_device_geo_params_init() for initialization of UFS device
geometry descriptor related parameters.
