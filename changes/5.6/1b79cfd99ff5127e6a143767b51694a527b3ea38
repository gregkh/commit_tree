drm: kirin: Revert "Fix for hikey620 display offset problem"

This reverts commit ff57c6513820efe945b61863cf4a51b79f18b592.

With the commit ff57c6513820 ("drm: kirin: Fix for hikey620
display offset problem") we added support for handling LDI
overflows by resetting the hardware.

However, its been observed that when we do hit the LDI overflow
condition, the irq seems to be screaming, and we do nothing but
stream:
  [drm:ade_irq_handler [kirin_drm]] *ERROR* LDI underflow!
over and over to the screen

I've tried a few appraoches to avoid this, but none has yet
been successful and the cure here is worse then the original
disease, so revert this for now.
