staging: most: Use managed buffer allocation

Clean up the driver with the new managed buffer allocation API.
Also remove the unnecessary checks of channels in hw_params callback
as this is guaranteed by the hw constraints in anyway.
After these cleanups, the hw_params and hw_free callbacks became
empty, hence dropped.
