crypto: cipher - introduce crypto_cipher_spawn and crypto_grab_cipher()

Currently, "cipher" (single-block cipher) spawns are usually initialized
by using crypto_get_attr_alg() to look up the algorithm, then calling
crypto_init_spawn().  In one case, crypto_grab_spawn() is used directly.

The former way is different from how skcipher, aead, and akcipher spawns
are initialized (they use crypto_grab_*()), and for no good reason.
This difference introduces unnecessary complexity.

The crypto_grab_*() functions used to have some problems, like not
holding a reference to the algorithm and requiring the caller to
initialize spawn->base.inst.  But those problems are fixed now.

Also, the cipher spawns are not strongly typed; e.g., the API requires
that the user manually specify the flags CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_CIPHER and
CRYPTO_ALG_TYPE_MASK.  Though the "cipher" algorithm type itself isn't
yet strongly typed, we can start by making the spawns strongly typed.

So, let's introduce a new 'struct crypto_cipher_spawn', and functions
crypto_grab_cipher() and crypto_drop_cipher() to grab and drop them.

Later patches will convert all cipher spawns to use these, then make
crypto_spawn_cipher() take 'struct crypto_cipher_spawn' as well, instead
of a bare 'struct crypto_spawn' as it currently does.
