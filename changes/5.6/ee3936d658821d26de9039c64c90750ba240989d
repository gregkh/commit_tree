ipv4: Notify route if replacing currently offloaded one

When replacing a route, its replacement should only be notified in case
the replaced route is of any interest to listeners. In other words, if
the replaced route is currently used in the data path, which means it is
the first route in the FIB alias list with the given {prefix, prefix
length, table ID}.

v2:
* Convert to use fib_find_alias() instead of fib_find_first_alias()
