hv_utils: Add the support of hibernation

Add util_pre_suspend() and util_pre_resume() for some hv_utils devices
(e.g. kvp/vss/fcopy), because they need special handling before
util_suspend() calls vmbus_close().

For kvp, all the possible pending work items should be cancelled.

For vss and fcopy, some extra clean-up needs to be done, i.e. fake a
THAW message for hv_vss_daemon and fake a CANCEL_FCOPY message for
hv_fcopy_daemon, otherwise when the VM resums back, the daemons
can end up in an inconsistent state (i.e. the file systems are
frozen but will never be thawed; the file transmitted via fcopy
may not be complete). Note: there is an extra patch for the daemons:
"Tools: hv: Reopen the devices if read() or write() returns errors",
because the hv_utils driver can not guarantee the whole transaction
finishes completely once util_suspend() starts to run (at this time,
all the userspace processes are frozen).

util_probe() disables channel->callback_event to avoid the race with
the channel callback.
