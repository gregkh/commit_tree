staging: wfx: simplify hif_start() usage

The structure hif_req_start come from hardware API. It is not intended
to be manipulated in upper layers of the driver.

In add, current code for hif_start() is too dumb. It should pack data
with hardware representation instead of leaving all work to the caller.
