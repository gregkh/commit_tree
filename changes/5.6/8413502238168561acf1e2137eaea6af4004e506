drm/i915/gt: Drop mutex serialisation between context pin/unpin

The last remaining reason for serialising the pin/unpin of the
intel_context is to ensure that our preallocated wakerefs are not
consumed too early (i.e. the unpin of the previous phase does not emit
the idle barriers for this phase before we even submit). All of the
other operations within the context pin/unpin are supposed to be
atomic...  Therefore, we can reduce the serialisation to being just on
the i915_active.preallocated_barriers itself and drop the nested
pin_mutex from intel_context_unpin().
