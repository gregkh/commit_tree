ARM: dts: imx6: phycore-som: fix arm and soc minimum voltage

The current set minimum voltage of 730000ÂµV seems to be wrong. I don't
know the document which specifies that but the imx6qdl datasheets says
that the minimum voltage should be 0.925V for VDD_ARM (LDO bypassed,
lowest opp) and 1.15V for VDD_SOC (LDO bypassed, lowest opp).
