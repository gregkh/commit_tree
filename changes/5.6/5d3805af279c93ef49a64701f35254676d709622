ubi: Fix an error pointer dereference in error handling code

If "seen_pebs = init_seen(ubi);" fails then "seen_pebs" is an error pointer
and we try to kfree() it which results in an Oops.

This patch re-arranges the error handling so now it only frees things
which have been allocated successfully.
