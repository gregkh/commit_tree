btrfs: reset device back to allocation state when removing

When closing a device, btrfs_close_one_device() first allocates a new
device, copies the device to close's name, replaces it in the dev_list
with the copy and then finally frees it.

This involves two memory allocation, which can potentially fail. As this
code path is tricky to unwind, the allocation failures where handled by
BUG_ON()s.

But this copying isn't strictly needed, all that is needed is resetting
the device in question to it's state it had after the allocation.
