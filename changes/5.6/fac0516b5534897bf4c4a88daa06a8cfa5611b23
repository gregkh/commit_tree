mm: thp: don't need care deferred split queue in memcg charge move path

If compound is true, this means it is a PMD mapped THP.  Which implies
the page is not linked to any defer list.  So the first code chunk will
not be executed.

Also with this reason, it would not be proper to add this page to a
defer list.  So the second code chunk is not correct.

Based on this, we should remove the defer list related code.
