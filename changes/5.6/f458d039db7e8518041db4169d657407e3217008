kvm: ioapic: Lazy update IOAPIC EOI

In-kernel IOAPIC does not receive EOI with AMD SVM AVIC
since the processor accelerate write to APIC EOI register and
does not trap if the interrupt is edge-triggered.

Workaround this by lazy check for pending APIC EOI at the time when
setting new IOPIC irq, and update IOAPIC EOI if no pending APIC EOI.
