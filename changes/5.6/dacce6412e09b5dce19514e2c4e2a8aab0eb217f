bpftool: Work-around rst2man conversion bug

Work-around what appears to be a bug in rst2man convertion tool, used to
create man pages out of reStructureText-formatted documents. If text line
starts with dot, rst2man will put it in resulting man file verbatim. This
seems to cause man tool to interpret it as a directive/command (e.g., `.bs`), and
subsequently not render entire line because it's unrecognized one.

Enclose '.xxx' words in extra formatting to work around.
