Input: hyperv-keyboard: Add the support of hibernation

Add suspend() and resume() functions so the Hyper-V virtual keyboard
can participate in VM hibernation.

Note that the keyboard is a "wakeup" device that could abort an in-progress
hibernation if there is keyboard event.  No attempt is made to suppress this
behavior.  If desired, a sysadmin can disable the keyboard as a wakeup device
using standard mechanisms such as:

echo disabled > /sys/bus/vmbus/drivers/hyperv_keyboard/XXX/power/wakeup
(where XXX is the device's GUID)
