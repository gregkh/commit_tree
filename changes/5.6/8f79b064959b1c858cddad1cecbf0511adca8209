kvm: mmu: Separate generating and setting mmio ptes

Separate the functions for generating MMIO page table entries from the
function that inserts them into the paging structure. This refactoring
will facilitate changes to the MMU sychronization model to use atomic
compare / exchanges (which are not guaranteed to succeed) instead of a
monolithic MMU lock.

No functional change expected.

Tested by running kvm-unit-tests on an Intel Haswell machine. This
commit introduced no new failures.
