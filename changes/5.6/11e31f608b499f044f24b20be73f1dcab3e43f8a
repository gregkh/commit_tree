watchdog/softlockup: Enforce that timestamp is valid on boot

Robert reported that during boot the watchdog timestamp is set to 0 for one
second which is the indicator for a watchdog reset.

The reason for this is that the timestamp is in seconds and the time is
taken from sched clock and divided by ~1e9. sched clock starts at 0 which
means that for the first second during boot the watchdog timestamp is 0,
i.e. reset.

Use ULONG_MAX as the reset indicator value so the watchdog works correctly
right from the start. ULONG_MAX would only conflict with a real timestamp
if the system reaches an uptime of 136 years on 32bit and almost eternity
on 64bit.
