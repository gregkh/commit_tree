drm/amdgpu: fix resume failures due to psp fw loading sequence change (v3)

this fix the regression caused by asd/ta loading sequence
adjustment recently. asd/ta loading was move out from
hw_start and should also be applied to psp_resume.
otherwise those fw loading will be ignored in resume phase.

v2: add the mutex unlock for asd loading failure case
v3: merge the error handling to failed tag
