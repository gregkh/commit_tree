rcu: Make PREEMPT_RCU be a modifier to TREE_RCU

Currently PREEMPT_RCU and TREE_RCU are mutually exclusive Kconfig
options.  But PREEMPT_RCU actually specifies a kind of TREE_RCU,
namely a preemptible TREE_RCU. This commit therefore makes PREEMPT_RCU
be a modifer to the TREE_RCU Kconfig option.  This has the benefit of
simplifying several of the #if expressions that formerly needed to
check both, but now need only check one or the other.
