watchdog: sama5d4_wdt: addition of sam9x60 compatible watchdog

Add support for SAM9X60 WDT into sama5d4_wdt.
This means that this driver gets a flag inside the data struct
that represents the sam9x60 support.
This flag differentiates between the two hardware blocks, and is set
according to the compatible of the driver instantiation.
