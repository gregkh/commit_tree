ARM: dts: rockchip: Use ABI name for write protect pin on veyron fievel/tiger

The flash write protect pin is currently named 'FW_WP_AP', which is
how the signal is called in the schematics. The Chrome OS ABI
requires the pin to be named 'AP_FLASH_WP_L', which is also how
it is called on all other veyron devices. Rename the pin to match
the ABI.
