fmc: remove left-over ipmi-fru.h after fmc deletion

Commit 6a80b30086b8 ("fmc: Delete the FMC subsystem") from Linus Walleij
deleted the obsolete FMC subsystem, but missed the MAINTAINERS entry and
include/linux/ipmi-fru.h mentioned in the MAINTAINERS entry.

Later, commit d5d4aa1ec198 ("MAINTAINERS: Remove FMC subsystem") from
Denis Efremov cleaned up the MAINTAINERS entry, but actually also missed
that include/linux/ipmi-fru.h should also be deleted while deleting its
reference in MAINTAINERS.

So, deleting include/linux/ipmi-fru.h slipped through the previous
clean-ups.

As there is no further use for include/linux/ipmi-fru.h, finally delete
include/linux/ipmi-fru.h for good now.
