KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Implement H_SVM_INIT_ABORT hcall

Implement the H_SVM_INIT_ABORT hcall which the Ultravisor can use to
abort an SVM after it has issued the H_SVM_INIT_START and before the
H_SVM_INIT_DONE hcalls. This hcall could be used when Ultravisor
encounters security violations or other errors when starting an SVM.

Note that this hcall is different from UV_SVM_TERMINATE ucall which
is used by HV to terminate/cleanup an VM that has becore secure.

The H_SVM_INIT_ABORT basically undoes operations that were done
since the H_SVM_INIT_START hcall - i.e page-out all the VM pages back
to normal memory, and terminate the SVM.

(If we do not bring the pages back to normal memory, the text/data
of the VM would be stuck in secure memory and since the SVM did not
go secure, its MSR_S bit will be clear and the VM wont be able to
access its pages even to do a clean exit).

Based on patches and discussion with Paul Mackerras, Ram Pai and
Bharata Rao.
