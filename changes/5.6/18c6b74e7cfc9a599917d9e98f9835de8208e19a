drm/amdgpu: Enable DISABLE_BARRIER_WAITCNT for Arcturus

In previous gfx9 parts, S_BARRIER shader instructions are implicitly
S_WAITCNT 0 instructions as well. This setting turns off that
mechanism in Arcturus and beyond. With this, shaders must follow the
ISA guide insofar as putting in explicit S_WAITCNT operations even
after an S_BARRIER.
