fs: allow deduplication of eof block into the end of the destination file

We always round down, to a multiple of the filesystem's block size, the
length to deduplicate at generic_remap_check_len().  However this is only
needed if an attempt to deduplicate the last block into the middle of the
destination file is requested, since that leads into a corruption if the
length of the source file is not block size aligned.  When an attempt to
deduplicate the last block into the end of the destination file is
requested, we should allow it because it is safe to do it - there's no
stale data exposure and we are prepared to compare the data ranges for
a length not aligned to the block (or page) size - in fact we even do
the data compare before adjusting the deduplication length.

After btrfs was updated to use the generic helpers from VFS (by commit
34a28e3d77535e ("Btrfs: use generic_remap_file_range_prep() for cloning
and deduplication")) we started to have user reports of deduplication
not reflinking the last block anymore, and whence users getting lower
deduplication scores.  The main use case is deduplication of entire
files that have a size not aligned to the block size of the filesystem.

We already allow cloning the last block to the end (and beyond) of the
destination file, so allow for deduplication as well.
