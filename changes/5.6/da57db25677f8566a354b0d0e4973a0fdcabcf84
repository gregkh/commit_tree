RDMA/core: Remove ucontext_lock from the uverbs_destry_ufile_hw() path

This lock only serializes ucontext creation. Instead of checking the
ucontext_lock during destruction hold the existing hw_destroy_rwsem during
creation, which is the standard pattern for object creation.

The simplification of locking is needed for the next patch.
