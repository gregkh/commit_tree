dmaengine: idxd: add configuration component of driver

The device is left unconfigured when the driver is loaded. Various
components are configured via the driver sysfs attributes. Once
configuration is done, the device can be enabled by writing the device name
to the bind attribute of the device driver sysfs. Disabling can be done
similarly. Also the individual work queues can also be enabled and disabled
through the bind/unbind attributes. A constructed hierarchy is created
through the struct device framework in order to provide appropriate
configuration points and device state and status. This hierarchy is
presented off the virtual DSA bus.

i.e. /sys/bus/dsa/...
