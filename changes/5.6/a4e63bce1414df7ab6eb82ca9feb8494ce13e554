RDMA/odp: Ensure the mm is still alive before creating an implicit child

Registration of a mmu_notifier requires the caller to hold a mmget() on
the mm as registration is not permitted to race with exit_mmap(). There is
a BUG_ON inside the mmu_notifier to guard against this.

Normally creating a umem is done against current which implicitly holds
the mmget(), however an implicit ODP child is created from a pagefault
work queue and is not guaranteed to have a mmget().

Call mmget() around this registration and abort faulting if the MM has
gone to exit_mmap().

Before the patch below the notifier was registered when the implicit ODP
parent was created, so there was no chance to register a notifier outside
of current.
