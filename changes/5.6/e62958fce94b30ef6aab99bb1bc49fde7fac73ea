btrfs: get rid of trivial __btrfs_lookup_bio_sums() wrappers

Currently, we have two wrappers for __btrfs_lookup_bio_sums():
btrfs_lookup_bio_sums_dio(), which is used for direct I/O, and
btrfs_lookup_bio_sums(), which is used everywhere else. The only
difference is that the _dio variant looks up csums starting at the given
offset instead of using the page index, which isn't actually direct
I/O-specific. Let's clean up the signature and return value of
__btrfs_lookup_bio_sums(), rename it to btrfs_lookup_bio_sums(), and get
rid of the trivial helpers.
