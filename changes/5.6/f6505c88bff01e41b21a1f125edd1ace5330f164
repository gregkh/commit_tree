tools/x86: Sync msr-index.h from kernel sources

Sync msr-index.h to pull in recent renames of the IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL
MSR definitions.  Update KVM's VMX selftest and turbostat accordingly.
Keep the full name in turbostat's output to avoid breaking someone's
workflow, e.g. if a script is looking for the full name.

While using the renamed defines is by no means necessary, do the sync
now to avoid leaving a landmine that will get stepped on the next time
msr-index.h needs to be refreshed for some other reason.

No functional change intended.
