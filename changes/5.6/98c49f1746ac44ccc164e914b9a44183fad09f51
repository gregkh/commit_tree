char: hpet: Fix out-of-bounds read bug

Currently, there is an out-of-bounds read on array hpetp->hp_dev
in the following for loop:

870         for (i = 0; i < hdp->hd_nirqs; i++)
871                 hpetp->hp_dev[i].hd_hdwirq = hdp->hd_irq[i];

This is due to the recent change from one-element array to
flexible-array member in struct hpets:

104 struct hpets {
	...
113         struct hpet_dev hp_dev[];
114 };

This change affected the total size of the dynamic memory
allocation, decreasing it by one time the size of struct hpet_dev.

Fix this by adjusting the allocation size when calling
struct_size().
