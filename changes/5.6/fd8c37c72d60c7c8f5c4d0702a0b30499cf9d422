crypto: testmgr - test setting misaligned keys

The alignment bug in ghash_setkey() fixed by commit 5c6bc4dfa515
("crypto: ghash - fix unaligned memory access in ghash_setkey()")
wasn't reliably detected by the crypto self-tests on ARM because the
tests only set the keys directly from the test vectors.

To improve test coverage, update the tests to sometimes pass misaligned
keys to setkey().  This applies to shash, ahash, skcipher, and aead.
