KVM: VMX: Add VMX_FEATURE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE

Commit 159348784ff0 ("x86/vmx: Introduce VMX_FEATURES_*") missed
bit 26 (enable user wait and pause) of Secondary Processor-based
VM-Execution Controls.

Add VMX_FEATURE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE flag so that it shows up in /proc/cpuinfo,
and use it to define SECONDARY_EXEC_ENABLE_USR_WAIT_PAUSE to make them
uniform.
