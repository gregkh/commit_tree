drm/vgem: Close use-after-free race in vgem_gem_create

There's two references floating around here (for the object reference,
not the handle_count reference, that's a different thing):

- The temporary reference held by vgem_gem_create, acquired by
  creating the object and released by calling
  drm_gem_object_put_unlocked.

- The reference held by the object handle, created by
  drm_gem_handle_create. This one generally outlives the function,
  except if a 2nd thread races with a GEM_CLOSE ioctl call.

So usually everything is correct, except in that race case, where the
access to gem_object->size could be looking at freed data already.
Which again isn't a real problem (userspace shot its feet off already
with the race, we could return garbage), but maybe someone can exploit
this as an information leak.
