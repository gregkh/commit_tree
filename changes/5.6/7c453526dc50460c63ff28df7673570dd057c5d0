net/mlx5e: Enable all available stats for uplink reps

Extend stats group array of uplink representor with all stats that are
available for PF in legacy mode, besides ipsec and TLS which are not
supported.

Don't output vport stats for uplink representor because they are already
handled by 802_3 group (with different names: {tx|rx}_{bytes|packets}_phy).
