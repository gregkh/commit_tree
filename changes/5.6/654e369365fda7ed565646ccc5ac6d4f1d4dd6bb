staging: wfx: remove unnecessary EDCA initialisation

mac80211 already call wfx_conf_tx() on every VIF instanciation. So, the
driver does not need to do it.

Note that current code did dirty things with wvif->edca_params. This
struct was initialized, but only 'queue_id' was really used. The other
members are only used to store temporary values.
