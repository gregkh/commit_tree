intel_idle: Use ACPI _CST for processor models without C-state tables

Modify the intel_idle driver to get the C-states information from ACPI
_CST if the processor model is not recognized by it.

The processor is still required to support MWAIT and the information
from ACPI _CST will only be used if all of the C-states listed by
_CST are of the ACPI_CSTATE_FFH type (which means that they are
expected to be entered via MWAIT).

Moreover, the driver assumes that the _CST information is the same
for all CPUs in the system, so it is sufficient to evaluate _CST for
one of them and extract the common list of C-states from there.
Also _CST is evaluated once at the system initialization time and
the driver does not respond to _CST change notifications (that can
be changed in the future).

The main functional difference between intel_idle with this change
and the ACPI processor driver is that the former sets the target
residency to be equal to the exit latency (provided by _CST) for
C1-type C-states and to 3 times the exit latency value for the other
C-state types, whereas the latter obtains the target residency by
multiplying the exit latency by the same number (2 by default) for
all C-state types.  Therefore it is expected that in general using
the former instead of the latter on the same system will lead to
improved energy-efficiency.
