software node: introduce CONFIG_KUNIT_DRIVER_PE_TEST

Currently the property entry kunit tests are built if CONFIG_KUNIT=y.
This will cause warnings when merged with the kunit tree that now
supports tristate CONFIG_KUNIT.  While the tests appear to compile
as a module, we get a warning about missing module license.

It's better to have a per-test suite CONFIG variable so that
we can do selective building of kunit-based suites, and can
also avoid merge issues like this.
