io_uring: add lookup table for various opcode needs

We currently have various switch statements that check if an opcode needs
a file, mm, etc. These are hard to keep in sync as opcodes are added. Add
a struct io_op_def that holds all of this information, so we have just
one spot to update when opcodes are added.

This also enables us to NOT allocate req->io if a deferred command
doesn't need it, and corrects some mistakes we had in terms of what
commands need mm context.
