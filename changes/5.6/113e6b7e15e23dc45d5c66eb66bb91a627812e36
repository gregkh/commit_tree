libbpf: Sanitise internal map names so they are not rejected by the kernel

The kernel only accepts map names with alphanumeric characters, underscores
and periods in their name. However, the auto-generated internal map names
used by libbpf takes their prefix from the user-supplied BPF object name,
which has no such restriction. This can lead to "Invalid argument" errors
when trying to load a BPF program using global variables.

Fix this by sanitising the map names, replacing any non-allowed characters
with underscores.
