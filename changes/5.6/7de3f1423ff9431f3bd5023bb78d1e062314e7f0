KVM: s390: Add new reset vcpu API

The architecture states that we need to reset local IRQs for all CPU
resets. Because the old reset interface did not support the normal CPU
reset we never did that on a normal reset.

Let's implement an interface for the missing normal and clear resets
and reset all local IRQs, registers and control structures as stated
in the architecture.

Userspace might already reset the registers via the vcpu run struct,
but as we need the interface for the interrupt clearing part anyway,
we implement the resets fully and don't rely on userspace to reset the
rest.
