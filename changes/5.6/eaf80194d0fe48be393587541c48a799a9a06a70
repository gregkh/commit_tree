posix-clocks: Rename .clock_get_timespec() callbacks accordingly

The upcoming support for time namespaces requires to have access to:

  - The time in a task's time namespace for sys_clock_gettime()
  - The time in the root name space for common_timer_get()

That adds a valid reason to finally implement a separate callback which
returns the time in ktime_t format in (struct k_clock).

As a preparation ground for introducing clock_get_ktime(), the original
callback clock_get() was renamed into clock_get_timespec().
Reflect the renaming into the callback implementations.
