tracing: Rename trace_buffer to array_buffer

As we are working to remove the generic "ring_buffer" name that is used by
both tracing and perf, the ring_buffer name for tracing will be renamed to
trace_buffer, and perf's ring buffer will be renamed to perf_buffer.

As there already exists a trace_buffer that is used by the trace_arrays, it
needs to be first renamed to array_buffer.
