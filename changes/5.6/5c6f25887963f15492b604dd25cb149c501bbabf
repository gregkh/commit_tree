bpf: Explicitly memset some bpf info structures declared on the stack

Trying to initialize a structure with "= {};" will not always clean out
all padding locations in a structure. So be explicit and call memset to
initialize everything for a number of bpf information structures that
are then copied from userspace, sometimes from smaller memory locations
than the size of the structure.
