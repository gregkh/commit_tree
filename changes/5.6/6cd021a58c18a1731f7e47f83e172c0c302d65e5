udp: segment looped gso packets correctly

Multicast and broadcast packets can be looped from egress to ingress
pre segmentation with dev_loopback_xmit. That function unconditionally
sets ip_summed to CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY.

udp_rcv_segment segments gso packets in the udp rx path. Segmentation
usually executes on egress, and does not expect packets of this type.
__udp_gso_segment interprets !CHECKSUM_PARTIAL as CHECKSUM_NONE. But
the offsets are not correct for gso_make_checksum.

UDP GSO packets are of type CHECKSUM_PARTIAL, with their uh->check set
to the correct pseudo header checksum. Reset ip_summed to this type.
(CHECKSUM_PARTIAL is allowed on ingress, see comments in skbuff.h)
