rcu: Avoid modifying mask_ofl_ipi in sync_rcu_exp_select_node_cpus()

The "mask_ofl_ipi" is used to track which CPUs get IPIed, however
in the IPI sending loop, "mask_ofl_ipi" along with another variable
"mask_ofl_test" might also get modified to record which CPUs' quiesent
states must be reported by the sync_rcu_exp_select_node_cpus() at
the end of sync_rcu_exp_select_node_cpus().  This overlap of roles
can be confusing, so this patch cleans things a little by using
"mask_ofl_ipi" solely for determining which CPUs must be IPIed  and
"mask_ofl_test" for solely determining on behalf of  which CPUs
sync_rcu_exp_select_node_cpus() must report a quiscent state.
