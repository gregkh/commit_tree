posix-timers: Make timer_settime() time namespace aware

Wire timer_settime() syscall into time namespace virtualization.

sys_timer_settime() calls the ktime->timer_set() callback. Right now,
common_timer_set() is the only implementation for the callback.

The user-supplied expiry value is converted from timespec64 to ktime and
then timens_ktime_to_host() can be used to convert namespace's time to the
host time.

Inside a time namespace kernel's time differs by a fixed offset from a
user-supplied time, but only absolute values (TIMER_ABSTIME) must be
converted.
