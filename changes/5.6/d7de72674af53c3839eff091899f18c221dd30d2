bpftool: Fix a leak of btf object

When testing a map has btf or not, maps_have_btf() tests it by actually
getting a btf_fd from sys_bpf(BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID). However, it
forgot to btf__free() it.

In maps_have_btf() stage, there is no need to test it by really
calling sys_bpf(BPF_BTF_GET_FD_BY_ID). Testing non zero
info.btf_id is good enough.

Also, the err_close case is unnecessary, and also causes double
close() because the calling func do_dump() will close() all fds again.
