net: stmmac: fix notifier registration

We cannot register the same netdev notifier multiple times when probing
stmmac devices. Register the notifier only once in module init, and also
make debugfs creation/deletion safe against simultaneous notifier call.

Fixes: 481a7d154cbb ("stmmac: debugfs entry name is not be changed when udev rename device name.")
