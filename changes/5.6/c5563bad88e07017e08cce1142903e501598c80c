IMA: Check IMA policy flag

process_buffer_measurement() may be called prior to IMA being
initialized (for instance, when the IMA hook is called when
a key is added to the .builtin_trusted_keys keyring), which
would result in a kernel panic.

This patch adds the check in process_buffer_measurement()
to return immediately if IMA is not initialized yet.
