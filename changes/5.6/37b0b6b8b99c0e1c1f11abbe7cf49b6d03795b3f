ext4: potential crash on allocation error in ext4_alloc_flex_bg_array()

If sbi->s_flex_groups_allocated is zero and the first allocation fails
then this code will crash.  The problem is that "i--" will set "i" to
-1 but when we compare "i >= sbi->s_flex_groups_allocated" then the -1
is type promoted to unsigned and becomes UINT_MAX.  Since UINT_MAX
is more than zero, the condition is true so we call kvfree(new_groups[-1]).
The loop will carry on freeing invalid memory until it crashes.
