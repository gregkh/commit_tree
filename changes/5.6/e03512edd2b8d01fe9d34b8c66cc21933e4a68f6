drm/i915/rps: Add frequency translation helpers

Add two helpers that for reading the actual GT's frequency. The
two helpers are:

 - intel_rps_read_cagf: reads the frequency and returns it not
   normalized

 - intel_rps_read_actual_frequency: provides the frequency in Hz.

Use the above helpers in sysfs and debugfs.
