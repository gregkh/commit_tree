dmaengine: ti: New driver for K3 UDMA

Split patch for review containing: defines, structs, io and low level
functions and interrupt callbacks.

DMA driver for
Texas Instruments K3 NAVSS Unified DMA â€“ Peripheral Root Complex (UDMA-P)

The UDMA-P is intended to perform similar (but significantly upgraded) functions
as the packet-oriented DMA used on previous SoC devices. The UDMA-P module
supports the transmission and reception of various packet types. The UDMA-P is
architected to facilitate the segmentation and reassembly of SoC DMA data
structure compliant packets to/from smaller data blocks that are natively
compatible with the specific requirements of each connected peripheral. Multiple
Tx and Rx channels are provided within the DMA which allow multiple segmentation
or reassembly operations to be ongoing. The DMA controller maintains state
information for each of the channels which allows packet segmentation and
reassembly operations to be time division multiplexed between channels in order
to share the underlying DMA hardware. An external DMA scheduler is used to
control the ordering and rate at which this multiplexing occurs for Transmit
operations. The ordering and rate of Receive operations is indirectly controlled
by the order in which blocks are pushed into the DMA on the Rx PSI-L interface.

The UDMA-P also supports acting as both a UTC and UDMA-C for its internal
channels. Channels in the UDMA-P can be configured to be either Packet-Based or
Third-Party channels on a channel by channel basis.

The initial driver supports:
- MEM_TO_MEM (TR mode)
- DEV_TO_MEM (Packet / TR mode)
- MEM_TO_DEV (Packet / TR mode)
- Cyclic (Packet / TR mode)
- Metadata for descriptors
