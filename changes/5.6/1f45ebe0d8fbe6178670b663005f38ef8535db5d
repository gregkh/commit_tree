ice: add extra check for null Rx descriptor

In the case where the hardware gives us a null Rx descriptor, it is
theoretically possible that we could call one of our skb-construction
functions with no data pointer, which would cause a panic.

In real life, this will never happen - we only get null RX
descriptors as the final descriptor in a chain of otherwise-valid
descriptors. When this happens, the skb will be extant and we'll just
call ice_add_rx_frag(), which can deal with empty data buffers.

Unfortunately, Coverity does not have intimate knowledge of our
hardware, so we must add a check here.
