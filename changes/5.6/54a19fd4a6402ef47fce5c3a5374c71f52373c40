i2c: core: Use DEVICE_ATTR_*() helper macros

Convert the i2c core sysfs attributes from DEVICE_ATTR() to
DEVICE_ATTR_*(), to reduce boilerplate.
This requires renaming some functions.

Although no suitable macro exists for the delete_device attribute,
rename i2c_sysfs_delete_device() to delete_device_store() for
consistency.
