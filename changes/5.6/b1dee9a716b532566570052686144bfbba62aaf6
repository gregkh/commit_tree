drm/dp_mst: Fill branch->num_ports

This field on drm_dp_mst_branch was never filled

It is initialized to zero when the port is kzallocced.
When a port is added to the list, increment num_ports,
and when a port is removed from the list, decrement num_ports.

v2: remember to decrement on port removal
v3: don't explicitly init to 0
v4: move decrement of num_ports to unlink_port function
