iwlwifi: implement a new device configuration table

Add a new device table that contains information that can be checked
at runtime in order to decide which configuration to use.  This allows
us to map the full cfg independently from the tran-specific
configuration.

This is the first step in creating the new table.  Subsequent patches
will add the possibility of checking different values at runtime in
order to make the decision.
