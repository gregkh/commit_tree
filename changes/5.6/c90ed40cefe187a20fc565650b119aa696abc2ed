ice: Enable writing hardware filtering tables

Enable the driver to write the filtering hardware tables to allow for
changing of RSS rules. Upon loading of DDP package, a minimal configuration
should be written to hardware.

Introduce and initialize structures for storing configuration and make
the top level calls to configure the RSS tables to initial values. A packet
segment will be created but nothing is written to hardware yet.
