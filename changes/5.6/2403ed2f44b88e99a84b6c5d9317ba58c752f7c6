EDAC: remove set but not used variable 'ecc_loc'

Fixes gcc '-Wunused-but-set-variable' warning:

drivers/edac/i5100_edac.c: In function ‘i5100_read_log’:
drivers/edac/i5100_edac.c:489:11: warning: variable ‘ecc_loc’
set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

It is never used, and so can be removed.
