kvm: arm/arm64: Fold VHE entry/exit work into kvm_vcpu_run_vhe()

With VHE, running a vCPU always requires the sequence:

1. kvm_arm_vhe_guest_enter();
2. kvm_vcpu_run_vhe();
3. kvm_arm_vhe_guest_exit()

... and as we invoke this from the shared arm/arm64 KVM code, 32-bit arm
has to provide stubs for all three functions.

To simplify the common code, and make it easier to make further
modifications to the arm64-specific portions in the near future, let's
fold kvm_arm_vhe_guest_enter() and kvm_arm_vhe_guest_exit() into
kvm_vcpu_run_vhe().

The 32-bit stubs for kvm_arm_vhe_guest_enter() and
kvm_arm_vhe_guest_exit() are removed, as they are no longer used. The
32-bit stub for kvm_vcpu_run_vhe() is left as-is.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
