leds: pca963x: Fix open-drain initialization

Before commit bb29b9cccd95 ("leds: pca963x: Add bindings to invert
polarity") Mode register 2 was initialized directly with either 0x01
or 0x05 for open-drain or totem pole (push-pull) configuration.

Afterwards, MODE2 initialization started using bitwise operations on
top of the default MODE2 register value (0x05). Using bitwise OR for
setting OUTDRV with 0x01 and 0x05 does not produce correct results.
When open-drain is used, instead of setting OUTDRV to 0, the driver
keeps it as 1:

Open-drain: 0x05 | 0x01 -> 0x05 (0b101 - incorrect)
Totem pole: 0x05 | 0x05 -> 0x05 (0b101 - correct but still wrong)

Now OUTDRV setting uses correct bitwise operations for initialization:

Open-drain: 0x05 & ~0x04 -> 0x01 (0b001 - correct)
Totem pole: 0x05 | 0x04 -> 0x05 (0b101 - correct)

Additional MODE2 register definitions are introduced now as well.
