btrfs: sysfs, add devid/dev_state kobject and device attributes

New sysfs attributes that track the filesystem status of devices, stored
in the per-filesystem directory in /sys/fs/btrfs/FSID/devinfo . There's
a directory for each device, with name corresponding to the numerical
device id.

  in_fs_metadata    - device is in the list of fs metadata
  missing           - device is missing (no device node or block device)
  replace_target    - device is target of replace
  writeable         - writes from fs are allowed

These attributes reflect the state of the device::dev_state and created
at mount time.

Sample output:
  $ pwd
   /sys/fs/btrfs/6e1961f1-5918-4ecc-a22f-948897b409f7/devinfo/1/
  $ ls
    in_fs_metadata  missing  replace_target  writeable
  $ cat missing
    0

The output from these attributes are 0 or 1. 0 indicates unset and 1
indicates set.  These attributes are readonly.

It is observed that the device delete thread and sysfs read thread will
not race because the delete thread calls sysfs kobject_put() which in
turn waits for existing sysfs read to complete.

Note for device replace devid swap:

During the replace the target device temporarily assumes devid 0 before
assigning the devid of the soruce device.

In btrfs_dev_replace_finishing() we remove source sysfs devid using the
function btrfs_sysfs_remove_devices_attr(), so after that call
kobject_rename() to update the devid in the sysfs.  This adds and calls
btrfs_sysfs_update_devid() helper function to update the device id.
