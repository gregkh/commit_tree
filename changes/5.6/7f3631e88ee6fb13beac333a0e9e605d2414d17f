riscv, bpf: Provide RISC-V specific JIT image alloc/free

This commit makes sure that the JIT images is kept close to the kernel
text, so BPF calls can use relative calling with auipc/jalr or jal
instead of loading the full 64-bit address and jalr.

The BPF JIT image region is 128 MB before the kernel text.
