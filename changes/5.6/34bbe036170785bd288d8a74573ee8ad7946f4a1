clk: zynqmp: Add support for clock with CLK_DIVIDER_POWER_OF_TWO flag

Existing clock divider functions is not checking for
base of divider. So, if any clock divider is power of 2
then clock rate calculation will be wrong.

Add support to calculate divider value for the clocks
with CLK_DIVIDER_POWER_OF_TWO flag.
