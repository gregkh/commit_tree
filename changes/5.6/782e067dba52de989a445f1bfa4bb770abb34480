virtio-blk: remove VIRTIO_BLK_F_SCSI support

Since the need for a special flag to support SCSI passthrough on a
block device was added in May 2017 the SCSI passthrough support in
virtio-blk has been disabled.  It has always been a bad idea
(just ask the original author..) and we have virtio-scsi for proper
passthrough.  The feature also never made it into the virtio 1.0
or later specifications.
