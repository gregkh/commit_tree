media: v4l2-mem2mem.c: fix broken links

The topology that v4l2_m2m_register_media_controller() creates for a
processing block actually created a source-to-source link and a sink-to-sink
link instead of two source-to-sink links.

Unfortunately v4l2-compliance never checked for such bad links, so this
went unreported for quite some time.
