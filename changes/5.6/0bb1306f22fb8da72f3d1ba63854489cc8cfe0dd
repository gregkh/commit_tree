ASoC: tlv320aic31xx: Add HP output driver pop reduction controls

HP output driver has two parameters that can be configured to reduce
pop noise: power-on delay and ramp-up step time. Two new kcontrols
have been added to set these parameters.

Also have to alter timeout in aic31xx_dapm_power_event() because default
timeout does fire when higher supported power-on delay are configured.
