bnxt_en: Fix TC queue mapping.

The driver currently only calls netdev_set_tc_queue when the number of
TCs is greater than 1.  Instead, the comparison should be greater than
or equal to 1.  Even with 1 TC, we need to set the queue mapping.

This bug can cause warnings when the number of TCs is changed back to 1.
