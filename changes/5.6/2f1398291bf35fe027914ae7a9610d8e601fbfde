fuse: don't overflow LLONG_MAX with end offset

Handle the special case of fuse_readpages() wanting to read the last page
of a hugest file possible and overflowing the end offset in the process.

This is basically to unbreak xfstests:generic/525 and prevent filesystems
from doing bad things with an overflowing offset.
