crypto: algapi - make crypto_grab_spawn() handle an ERR_PTR() name

To allow further simplifying template ->create() functions, make
crypto_grab_spawn() handle an ERR_PTR() name by passing back the error.

For most templates, this will allow the result of crypto_attr_alg_name()
to be passed directly to crypto_grab_*(), rather than first having to
assign it to a variable [where it can then potentially be misused, as it
was in the rfc7539 template prior to commit 5e27f38f1f3f ("crypto:
chacha20poly1305 - set cra_name correctly")] and check it for error.
