USB: core: add endpoint-blacklist quirk

Add a new device quirk that can be used to blacklist endpoints.

Since commit 3e4f8e21c4f2 ("USB: core: fix check for duplicate
endpoints") USB core ignores any duplicate endpoints found during
descriptor parsing.

In order to handle devices where the first interfaces with duplicate
endpoints are the ones that should have their endpoints ignored, we need
to add a blacklist.
