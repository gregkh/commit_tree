ASoC: meson: axg-fifo: fix fifo threshold setup

On TODDR sm1, the fifo threshold register field is slightly different
compared to the other SoCs. This leads to the fifo A being flushed to
memory every 8kB. If the period is smaller than that, several periods
are pushed to memory and notified at once. This is not ideal.

Fix the register field update. With this, the fifos are flushed every
128B. We could still do better, like adapt the threshold depending on
the period size, but at least it consistent across the different
SoC/fifos
