rtc: cmos: Stop using shared IRQ

As reported by Guilherme G. Piccoli:

---8<---8<---8<---

The rtc-cmos interrupt setting was changed in the commit 079062b28fb4
("rtc: cmos: prevent kernel warning on IRQ flags mismatch") in order
to allow shared interrupts; according to that commit's description,
some machine got kernel warnings due to the interrupt line being shared
between rtc-cmos and other hardware, and rtc-cmos didn't allow IRQ sharing
that time.

After the aforementioned commit though it was observed a huge increase
in lost HPET interrupts in some systems, observed through the following
kernel message:

[...] hpet1: lost 35 rtc interrupts

After investigation, it was narrowed down to the shared interrupts
usage when having the kernel option "irqpoll" enabled. In this case,
all IRQ handlers are called for non-timer interrupts, if such handlers
are setup in shared IRQ lines. The rtc-cmos IRQ handler could be set to
hpet_rtc_interrupt(), which will produce the kernel "lost interrupts"
message after doing work - lots of readl/writel to HPET registers, which
are known to be slow.

Although "irqpoll" is not a default kernel option, it's used in some contexts,
one being the kdump kernel (which is an already "impaired" kernel usually
running with 1 CPU available), so the performance burden could be considerable.
Also, the same issue would happen (in a shorter extent though) when using
"irqfixup" kernel option.

In a quick experiment, a virtual machine with uptime of 2 minutes produced
>300 calls to hpet_rtc_interrupt() when "irqpoll" was set, whereas without
sharing interrupts this number reduced to 1 interrupt. Machines with more
hardware than a VM should generate even more unnecessary HPET interrupts
in this scenario.

After looking into the rtc-cmos driver history and DSDT table from
the Microsoft Surface 3, we may notice that Hans de Goede submitted
a correct fix (see dependency below). Thus, we simply revert
the culprit commit.
