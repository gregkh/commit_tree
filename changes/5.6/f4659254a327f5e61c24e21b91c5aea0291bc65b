arm64: mm: Use modern annotations for assembly functions

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotation of assembly functions
in the kernel new macros have been introduced. These replace ENTRY and
ENDPROC and also add a new annotation for static functions which previously
had no ENTRY equivalent. Update the annotations in the mm code to the
new macros. Even the functions called from non-standard environments
like idmap have no special requirements on their environments so can be
treated like regular functions.
