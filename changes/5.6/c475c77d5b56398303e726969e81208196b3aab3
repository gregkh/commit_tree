kunit: allow kunit tests to be loaded as a module

As tests are added to kunit, it will become less feasible to execute
all built tests together.  By supporting modular tests we provide
a simple way to do selective execution on a running system; specifying

CONFIG_KUNIT=y
CONFIG_KUNIT_EXAMPLE_TEST=m

...means we can simply "insmod example-test.ko" to run the tests.

To achieve this we need to do the following:

o export the required symbols in kunit
o string-stream tests utilize non-exported symbols so for now we skip
  building them when CONFIG_KUNIT_TEST=m.
o drivers/base/power/qos-test.c contains a few unexported interface
  references, namely freq_qos_read_value() and freq_constraints_init().
  Both of these could be potentially defined as static inline functions
  in include/linux/pm_qos.h, but for now we simply avoid supporting
  module build for that test suite.
o support a new way of declaring test suites.  Because a module cannot
  do multiple late_initcall()s, we provide a kunit_test_suites() macro
  to declare multiple suites within the same module at once.
o some test module names would have been too general ("test-test"
  and "example-test" for kunit tests, "inode-test" for ext4 tests);
  rename these as appropriate ("kunit-test", "kunit-example-test"
  and "ext4-inode-test" respectively).

Also define kunit_test_suite() via kunit_test_suites()
as callers in other trees may need the old definition.
