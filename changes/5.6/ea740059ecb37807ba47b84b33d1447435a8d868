KVM: x86: Protect DR-based index computations from Spectre-v1/L1TF attacks

This fixes a Spectre-v1/L1TF vulnerability in __kvm_set_dr() and
kvm_get_dr().
Both kvm_get_dr() and kvm_set_dr() (a wrapper of __kvm_set_dr()) are
exported symbols so KVM should tream them conservatively from a security
perspective.

Fixes: 020df0794f57 ("KVM: move DR register access handling into generic code")
