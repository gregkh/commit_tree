ASoC: SOF: Introduce default_fw_filename member in sof_dev_desc

Currently the FW filename is obtained from the ACPI matching
table when determining which machine driver to use. In
preparation for making the machine driver ACPI match optional
for Device Tree platforms and moving the machine driver selection
out of the SOF core, this patch introduces the default_fw_filename
member in struct sof_dev_desc.

Once the machine driver selection is moved out of SOF core,
the nocodec_fw_filename will become obsolete and will be removed.
