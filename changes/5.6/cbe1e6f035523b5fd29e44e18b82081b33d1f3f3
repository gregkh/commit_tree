KVM: x86/mmu: Incorporate guest's page level into max level for shadow MMU

Restrict the max level for a shadow page based on the guest's level
instead of capping the level after the fact for host-mapped huge pages,
e.g. hugetlbfs pages.  Explicitly capping the max level using the guest
mapping level also eliminates FNAME(page_fault)'s subtle dependency on
THP only supporting 2mb pages.

No functional change intended.
