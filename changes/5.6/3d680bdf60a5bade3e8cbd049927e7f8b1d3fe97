mm/page_isolation: fix potential warning from user

It makes sense to call the WARN_ON_ONCE(zone_idx(zone) == ZONE_MOVABLE)
from start_isolate_page_range(), but should avoid triggering it from
userspace, i.e, from is_mem_section_removable() because it could crash
the system by a non-root user if warn_on_panic is set.

While at it, simplify the code a bit by removing an unnecessary jump
label.
