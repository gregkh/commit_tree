net/mlx5: Fix sleep while atomic in mlx5_eswitch_get_vepa

rtnl_bridge_getlink is protected by rcu lock, so mlx5_eswitch_get_vepa
cannot take mutex lock. Two possible issues can happen:
1. User at the same time change vepa mode via RTM_SETLINK command.
2. User at the same time change the switchdev mode via devlink netlink
interface.

Case 1 cannot happen because rtnl executes one message in order.
Case 2 can happen but we do not expect user to change the switchdev mode
when changing vepa. Even if a user does it, so he will read a value
which is no longer valid.
