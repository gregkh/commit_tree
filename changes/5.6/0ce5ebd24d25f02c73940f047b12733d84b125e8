mfd: ioc3: Add driver for SGI IOC3 chip

SGI IOC3 chip has integrated ethernet, keyboard and mouse interface.
It also supports connecting a SuperIO chip for serial and parallel
interfaces. IOC3 is used inside various SGI systemboards and add-on
cards with different equipped external interfaces.

Support for ethernet and serial interfaces were implemented inside
the network driver. This patchset moves out the not network related
parts to a new MFD driver, which takes care of card detection,
setup of platform devices and interrupt distribution for the subdevices.
