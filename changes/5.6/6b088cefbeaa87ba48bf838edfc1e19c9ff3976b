alarmtimer: Update alarmtimer_get_rtcdev() docs to reflect reality

This function doesn't do anything like this comment says when an RTC device
hasn't been chosen. It looks like we used to do something like that before
commit 8bc0dafb5cf3 ("alarmtimers: Rework RTC device selection using class
interface") but that's long gone now. Remove this sentence to avoid
confusing the reader.
