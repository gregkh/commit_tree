Revert "net: dev: introduce support for sch BYPASS for lockless qdisc"

This reverts commit ba27b4cdaaa66561aaedb2101876e563738d36fe

Ahmed reported ouf-of-order issues bisected to commit ba27b4cdaaa6
("net: dev: introduce support for sch BYPASS for lockless qdisc").
I can't find any working solution other than a plain revert.

This will introduce some minor performance regressions for
pfifo_fast qdisc. I plan to address them in net-next with more
indirect call wrapper boilerplate for qdiscs.
