drm/tegra: Map cmdbuf once for reloc processing

A few reasons to drop kmap:

- For native objects all we do is look at obj->vaddr anyway, so might
  as well not call functions for every page.

- Reloc-processing on dma-buf is ... questionable.

- Plus most dma-buf that bother kernel cpu mmaps give you at least
  vmap, much less kmaps. And all the ones relevant for arm-soc are
  again doing a obj->vaddr game anyway, there's no real kmap going on
  on arm it seems.

Plus this seems to be the only real in-tree user of dma_buf_kmap, and
I'd like to get rid of that.
