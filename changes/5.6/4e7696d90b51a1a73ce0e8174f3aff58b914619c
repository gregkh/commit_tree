sctp: get netns from asoc and ep base

Commit 312434617cb1 ("sctp: cache netns in sctp_ep_common") set netns
in asoc and ep base since they're created, and it will never change.
It's a better way to get netns from asoc and ep base, comparing to
calling sock_net().

This patch is to replace them.

v1->v2:
  - no change.
