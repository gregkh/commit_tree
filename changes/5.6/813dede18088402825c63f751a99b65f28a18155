dt-bindings: msm: Rename cache-controller to system-cache-controller

DT schema checks for the node name 'cache-controller' and enforces
that there has to be a cache-level associated with it. But LLCC is
a system cache and does not have a cache-level property and hence
the dt binding check fails. So let us rename the LLCC cache-controller
to system-cache-controller which is the proper description and also
makes the schema happy.
