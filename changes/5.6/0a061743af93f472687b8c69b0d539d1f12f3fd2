compat_ioctl: fix FIONREAD on devices

My final cleanup patch for sys_compat_ioctl() introduced a regression on
the FIONREAD ioctl command, which is used for both regular and special
files, but only works on regular files after my patch, as I had missed
the warning that Al Viro put into a comment right above it.

Change it back so it can work on any file again by moving the implementation
to do_vfs_ioctl() instead.
