media: meson: add missing allocation failure check on new_buf

Currently if the allocation of new_buf fails then a null pointer
dereference occurs when assiging new_buf->vb. Avoid this by returning
early on a memory allocation failure as there is not much more can
be done at this point.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference null return")
