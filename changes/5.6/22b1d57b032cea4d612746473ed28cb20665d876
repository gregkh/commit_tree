KVM: x86/mmu: Enforce max_level on HugeTLB mappings

Limit KVM's mapping level for HugeTLB based on its calculated max_level.
The max_level check prior to invoking host_mapping_level() only filters
out the case where KVM cannot create a 2mb mapping, it doesn't handle
the scenario where KVM can create a 2mb but not 1gb mapping, and the
host is using a 1gb HugeTLB mapping.
