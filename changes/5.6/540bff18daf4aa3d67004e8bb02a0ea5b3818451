pinctrl: lynxpoint: Move ownership check to IRQ chip

There is nothing wrong with requesting pin that owned by ACPI.
The only difference is how interrupt status will be reflected.
It means that in ACPI mode we may not use pin as GPIO-backed IRQ.

Taking above into consideration, move the check from GPIO to IRQ chip
callback.
