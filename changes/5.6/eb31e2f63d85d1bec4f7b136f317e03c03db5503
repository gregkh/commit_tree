utimes: Clamp the timestamps in notify_change()

Push clamping timestamps into notify_change(), so in-kernel
callers like nfsd and overlayfs will get similar timestamp
set behavior as utimes.

AV: get rid of clamping in ->setattr() instances; we don't need
to bother with that there, with notify_change() doing normalization
in all cases now (it already did for implicit case, since current_time()
clamps).
