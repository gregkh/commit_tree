misc: alcor_pci: Add AU6625 to list of supported PCI_IDs

I have added the AU6625 PCI_ID to the list of supported IDs:
alcor_pci.c
// Added au6625s ID to the array of supported devices
alcor_pci.h
// Added entry to define the PCI ID

Made it fit in with the already submitted code:
alcor_pci.c
// Added config entry to that matches the one for au6601

>From general usage there seems to be no problems.
