drm/amd/display: Fix update type for multiple planes

[Why]
determine_update_type_for_commit() uses pointers to single instance
of local variable to fill scaling/color info for all planes updates.
This is a bug, that leads to incorrect update type for commit in case
of multiple planes per crtc.
Each plane should refer to separate scaling/color data.

[How]
Use arrays for plane properties.
Bundle all properties into a single structure to simplify memory allocation.
