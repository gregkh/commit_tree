powernv/pci: Fold pnv_pci_dma_dev_setup() into the pci-ioda.c version

pnv_pci_dma_dev_setup() does nothing but call the phb->dma_dev_setup()
callback, if one exists. That callback is only set for normal PCIe PHBs so
we can remove the layer of indirection and use the ioda version in
the pci_controller_ops.
