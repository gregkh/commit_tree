drm/bridge: anx6345: Fix compilation breakage on systems without CONFIG_OF

The driver assumes that the platform uses the device tree, and thus relies
on some fields (of_node) being declared in some structures (drm_bridge).

This isn't true for all platforms, so make sure we can only compile the
ANX6345 on platforms where DT support is selected.
