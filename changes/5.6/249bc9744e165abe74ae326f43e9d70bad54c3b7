net: phy: avoid clearing PHY interrupts twice in irq handler

On all PHY drivers that implement did_interrupt() reading the interrupt
status bits clears them. This means we may loose an interrupt that
is triggered between calling did_interrupt() and phy_clear_interrupt().
As part of the fix make it a requirement that did_interrupt() clears
the interrupt.

The Fixes tag refers to the first commit where the patch applies
cleanly.
