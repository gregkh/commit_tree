ARM: dts: ux500: samsung-golden: Add Bluetooth

samsung-golden uses a BCM4334 WiFi+BT combo chip.
The BT part is connected via UART and supported by the hci_bcm
driver in mainline.
Add the necessary device tree changes to make it load correctly.

It requires (seemingly) device-specific firmware that can be
extracted from the stock Android system used on samsung-golden:
  - /system/bin/bcm4334.hcd -> /lib/firmware/brcm/BCM4334B0.hcd

On my device, scanning for other Bluetooth devices works just fine,
but for some reason it keeps disconnecting immediately
when attempting to connect to an other device.
