arm64: dts: rockchip: Fix min voltage for rk3399-firefly vdd_log

The min/max value of vdd_log is decide by pwm IO voltage and its
resistors, the rk3399-firefly board's pwm regulator circuit is designed
for IO voltage at 1.8V, while the board actually use 3.0V for IO, which
at last lead to the min-microvolt to '430mV' instead of '800mV'.
