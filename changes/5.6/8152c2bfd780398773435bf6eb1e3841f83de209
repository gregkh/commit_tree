drm/panel: Add driver for Sony ACX424AKP panel

The Sony ACX424AKP is a command/videomode DSI panel for
mobile devices. It is used on the ST-Ericsson HREF520
reference design. We support video mode by default, but
it is possible to switch the panel into command mode
by using the bool property "dsi-command-mode".
