Revert "drm/amd/display: Don't skip link training for empty dongle"

This reverts commit 80adaebd2d411b7d6872a097634848a71eb13d20.

[WHY]
This change was working around a regression that occured in this:
commit 0301ccbaf67d ("drm/amd/display: DP Compliance 400.1.1 failure")

With the fix to run verify_link_cap when the SINK_COUNT of
dongles becomes non-zero this change is no longer needed.
