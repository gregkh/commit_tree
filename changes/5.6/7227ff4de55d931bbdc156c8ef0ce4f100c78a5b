Btrfs: fix race between adding and putting tree mod seq elements and nodes

There is a race between adding and removing elements to the tree mod log
list and rbtree that can lead to use-after-free problems.

Consider the following example that explains how/why the problems happens:

1) Task A has mod log element with sequence number 200. It currently is
   the only element in the mod log list;

2) Task A calls btrfs_put_tree_mod_seq() because it no longer needs to
   access the tree mod log. When it enters the function, it initializes
   'min_seq' to (u64)-1. Then it acquires the lock 'tree_mod_seq_lock'
   before checking if there are other elements in the mod seq list.
   Since the list it empty, 'min_seq' remains set to (u64)-1. Then it
   unlocks the lock 'tree_mod_seq_lock';

3) Before task A acquires the lock 'tree_mod_log_lock', task B adds
   itself to the mod seq list through btrfs_get_tree_mod_seq() and gets a
   sequence number of 201;

4) Some other task, name it task C, modifies a btree and because there
   elements in the mod seq list, it adds a tree mod elem to the tree
   mod log rbtree. That node added to the mod log rbtree is assigned
   a sequence number of 202;

5) Task B, which is doing fiemap and resolving indirect back references,
   calls btrfs get_old_root(), with 'time_seq' == 201, which in turn
   calls tree_mod_log_search() - the search returns the mod log node
   from the rbtree with sequence number 202, created by task C;

6) Task A now acquires the lock 'tree_mod_log_lock', starts iterating
   the mod log rbtree and finds the node with sequence number 202. Since
   202 is less than the previously computed 'min_seq', (u64)-1, it
   removes the node and frees it;

7) Task B still has a pointer to the node with sequence number 202, and
   it dereferences the pointer itself and through the call to
   __tree_mod_log_rewind(), resulting in a use-after-free problem.

This issue can be triggered sporadically with the test case generic/561
from fstests, and it happens more frequently with a higher number of
duperemove processes. When it happens to me, it either freezes the VM or
it produces a trace like the following before crashing:

Fix this by ensuring that btrfs_put_tree_mod_seq() computes the minimum
sequence number and iterates the rbtree while holding the lock
'tree_mod_log_lock' in write mode. Also get rid of the 'tree_mod_seq_lock'
lock, since it is now redundant.
