ASoC: SOF: core: modify the signature for snd_sof_create_page_table

Modify the signature for snd_sof_create_page_table to
take struct device pointer as an argument instead of
struct snd_sof_dev as this will be used by both the SOF
core device and its clients. Also, move the definition
out of core.c to utils.c.
