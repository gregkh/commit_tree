pci/hotplug/pnv-php: Relax check when disabling slot

The driver only allows to disable a slot in the POPULATED
state. However, if an error occurs while enabling the slot, say
because the link couldn't be trained, then the POPULATED state may not
be reached, yet the power state of the slot is on. So allow to disable
a slot in the REGISTERED state. Removing the devices will do nothing
since it's not populated, and we'll set the power state of the slot
back to off.
