net: ethernet: freescale: make UCC_GETH explicitly depend on PPC32

Currently, QUICC_ENGINE depends on PPC32, so this in itself does not
change anything. In order to allow removing the PPC32 dependency from
QUICC_ENGINE and avoid allmodconfig build failures, add this explicit
dependency.

Also, the QE Ethernet has never been integrated on any non-PowerPC SoC
and most likely will not be in the future.
