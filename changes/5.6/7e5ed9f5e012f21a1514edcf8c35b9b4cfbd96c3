serial: Move sysrq members above

At the current place members those follow are:
:	upf_t			flags;
:	upstat_t		status;
:	int			hw_stopped;
:	unsigned int		mctrl;
:	unsigned int		timeout;
:	unsigned int		type;
:	const struct uart_ops	*ops;

Together, they give (*ops) 8-byte align on 64-bit platforms.
And `sysrq_ch` introduces 4-byte padding.

On the other side, above:
:	struct device		*dev;
:	unsigned char		hub6;
:	unsigned char		suspended;
:	unsigned char		unused[2];
:	const char		*name;

Adds another 4-byte padding.

Moving sysrq members just before `hub6` allows to save 8 bytes
per-uart_port on 64-bit platforms:
On my gcc, x86_64 sizeof(struct uart_port) goes from 528 to 520.
