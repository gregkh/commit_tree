hv_utils: Support host-initiated hibernation request

Update the Shutdown IC version to 3.2, which is required for the host to
send the hibernation request.

The user is expected to create the below udev rule file, which is applied
upon the host-initiated hibernation request:

root@localhost:~# cat /usr/lib/udev/rules.d/40-vm-hibernation.rules
SUBSYSTEM=="vmbus", ACTION=="change", DRIVER=="hv_utils", ENV{EVENT}=="hibernate", RUN+="/usr/bin/systemctl hibernate"
