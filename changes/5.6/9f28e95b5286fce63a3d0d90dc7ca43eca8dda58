pwm: sun4i: Add support to output source clock directly

PWM core has an option to bypass whole logic and output unchanged source
clock as PWM output. This is achieved by enabling bypass bit.

Note that when bypass is enabled, no other setting has any meaning, not
even enable bit.

This mode of operation is needed to achieve high enough frequency to
serve as clock source for AC200 chip which is integrated into same
package as H6 SoC.
