io_uring: don't map read/write iovec potentially twice

If we have a read/write that is deferred, we already setup the async IO
context for that request, and mapped it. When we later try and execute
the request and we get -EAGAIN, we don't want to attempt to re-map it.
If we do, we end up with garbage in the iovec, which typically leads
to an -EFAULT or -EINVAL completion.
