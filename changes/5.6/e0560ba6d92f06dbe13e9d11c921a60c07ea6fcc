perf annotate: Fix segfault with source toggle

While rendering annotate browser from perf report tui, we keep track
of total number of lines(asm + source) in annotation->nr_entries and
total number of asm lines in annotation->nr_asm_entries. But we don't
reset them before starting. Thus if user annotates same function
multiple times, we restart incrementing these fields with old values.

This causes a segfault when user tries to toggle source code after
annotating same function multiple times. Fix it.
