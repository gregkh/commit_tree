gfs2: eliminate ssize parameter from gfs2_struct2blk

Every caller of function gfs2_struct2blk specified sizeof(u64).

This patch eliminates the unnecessary parameter and replaces the
size calculation with a new superblock variable that is computed
to be the maximum number of block pointers we can fit inside a
log descriptor, as is done for pointers per dinode and indirect
block.
