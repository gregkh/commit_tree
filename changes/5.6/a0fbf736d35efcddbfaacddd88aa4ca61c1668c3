btrfs: Rename __btrfs_free_reserved_extent to btrfs_pin_reserved_extent

__btrfs_free_reserved_extent now performs the actions of
btrfs_free_and_pin_reserved_extent. But this name is a bit of a
misnomer, since the extent is not really freed but just pinned. Reflect
this in the new name. No semantics changes.
