usb: renesas_usbhs: Switch to GPIO descriptor

The Renesas USBHS driver includes a bit of surplus headers
and uses the old GPIO API so let's switch it to use the
GPIO descriptor.

I noticed that the enable_gpio inside renesas_usbhs_driver_param
isn't really referenced anywhere, and it is also the wrong
type (u32) so let's just delete it and use a local variable
instead.
