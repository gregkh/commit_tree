bpftool: Don't crash on missing xlated program instructions

Turns out the xlated program instructions can also be missing if
kptr_restrict sysctl is set. This means that the previous fix to check the
jited_prog_insns pointer was insufficient; add another check of the
xlated_prog_insns pointer as well.

Fixes: 5b79bcdf0362 ("bpftool: Don't crash on missing jited insns or ksyms")
Fixes: cae73f233923 ("bpftool: use bpf_program__get_prog_info_linear() in prog.c:do_dump()")
