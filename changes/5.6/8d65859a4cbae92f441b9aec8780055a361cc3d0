drm/i915/gem: Comment on inability to check args.pad for MMAP_OFFSET

Since we didn't check and insist that args.pad must be zero for MMAP_GTT
historically, we cannot insert a check now as old userspace may be
feeding in garbage. As such the lack of check is enshrined into the ABI,
so add a comment to remind us we cannot add the check later.
