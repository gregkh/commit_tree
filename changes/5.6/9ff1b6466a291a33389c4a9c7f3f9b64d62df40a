IB/core: Fix ODP with IB_ACCESS_HUGETLB handling

As VMAs for a given range might not be available as part of the
registration phase in ODP.

ib_init_umem_odp() considered the expected page shift value that was
previously set and initializes its internals accordingly.

If memory isn't backed by physical contiguous pages aligned to a hugepage
boundary an error will be set as part of the page fault flow and come back
to the user as some failed RDMA operation.
