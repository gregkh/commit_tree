net: dsa: tag_8021q: replace dsa_8021q_remove_header with __skb_vlan_pop

Not only did this wheel did not need reinventing, but there is also
an issue with it: It doesn't remove the VLAN header in a way that
preserves the L2 payload checksum when that is being provided by the DSA
master hw.  It should recalculate checksum both for the push, before
removing the header, and for the pull afterwards. But the current
implementation is quite dizzying, with pulls followed immediately
afterwards by pushes, the memmove is done before the push, etc.  This
makes a DSA master with RX checksumming offload to print stack traces
with the infamous 'hw csum failure' message.

So remove the dsa_8021q_remove_header function and replace it with
something that actually works with inet checksumming.
