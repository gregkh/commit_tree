IMA: Add support to limit measuring keys

Limit measuring keys to those keys being loaded onto a given set of
keyrings only and when the user id (uid) matches if uid is specified
in the policy.

This patch defines a new IMA policy option namely "keyrings=" that
can be used to specify a set of keyrings. If this option is specified
in the policy for "measure func=KEY_CHECK" then only the keys
loaded onto a keyring given in the "keyrings=" option are measured.

If uid is specified in the policy then the key is measured only if
the current user id matches the one specified in the policy.

Added a new parameter namely "keyring" (name of the keyring) to
process_buffer_measurement(). The keyring name is passed to
ima_get_action() to determine the required action.
ima_match_rules() is updated to check keyring in the policy, if
specified, for KEY_CHECK function.
