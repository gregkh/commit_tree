of: overlay: Remove blank line between assignment and check

There used to be blank lines between assignment and check of the
__of_changeset_revert_entries() result, to make the phandle cache
management operations stand out.  After the removal of those operations
in commit 90dc0d1ce890419f ("of: Rework and simplify phandle cache to
use a fixed size"), there is no longer a reason to have such a blank
line.

Remove the blank line, to rejoin visibly the status assignement and
check, and to match coding style.
