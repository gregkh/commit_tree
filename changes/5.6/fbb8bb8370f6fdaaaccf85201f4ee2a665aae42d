ARM: dts: Configure omap4 rng to probe with ti-sysc

Add RNG interconnect data for omap4 similar to what dra7 has. The
clock is OMAP4_CM_L4SEC_RNG_CLKCTRL_OFFSET at offset address 0x01c0,
which matches what dra7 also has with DRA7_L4SEC_CLKCTRL_INDEX(0x1c0).

Note that we need to also add the related l4_secure clock entries.
I've only added RNG, the others can be added as they get tested.
They are probably very similar to what we already have for dra7
in dra7_l4sec_clkctrl_regs[].

With the clock tagged CLKF_SOC_NONSEC, clock is set disabled for secure
devices and clk_get() will fail. Additionally we disable the RNG target
module on droid4 to avoid introducing new boot time warnings.
