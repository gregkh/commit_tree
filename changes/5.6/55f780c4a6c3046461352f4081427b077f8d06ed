net: sched: pie: fix commenting

Fix punctuation and logical mistakes in the comments. The
logical mistake was that "dequeue_rate" is no longer the default
way to calculate queuing delay and is not needed. The default
way to calculate queue delay was changed in commit cec2975f2b70
("net: sched: pie: enable timestamp based delay calculation").
