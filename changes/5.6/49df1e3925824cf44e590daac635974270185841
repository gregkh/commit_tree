ASoC: rsnd: Calculate DALIGN inversion at run-time

There is no need to store the inverted DALIGN values in the table, as
they can easily be calculated at run-time.  This also protects against
the introduction of inconsistencies between normal and inverted values
by a future table modification.

Reorder the two subexpressions in the AND check, to perform the least
expensive check first.
