block: mark zone-mgmt bios with REQ_SYNC

In the current implementation, final zone-mgmt request is issued with
submit_bio_wait() which marks the bio REQ_SYNC. This is needed since
immediate action is expected for zone-mgmt requests as these are
blocking operations. This also bypasses the scheduler in the
blk_mq_make_request() and dispatches the request directly into the
hw ctx.

This patch marks all the chained bios REQ_SYNC so that we can have
above-mentioned behavior for non-final bios also.
