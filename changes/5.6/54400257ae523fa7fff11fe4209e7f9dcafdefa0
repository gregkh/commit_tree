drm/i915/gt: Remove direct invocation of breadcrumb signaling

Only signal the breadcrumbs from inside the irq_work, simplifying our
interface and calling conventions. The micro-optimisation here is that
by always using the irq_work interface, we know we are always inside an
irq-off critical section for the breadcrumb signaling and can ellide
save/restore of the irq flags.
