arch/Kconfig: update HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE description

save_stack_trace_tsk_reliable() is not the only function providing the
reliable stack traces anymore.  Architecture might define ARCH_STACKWALK
which provides a newer stack walking interface and has
arch_stack_walk_reliable() function.  Update the description accordingly.
