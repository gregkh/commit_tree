of: Add OF_DMA_DEFAULT_COHERENT & select it on powerpc

There's an OF helper called of_dma_is_coherent(), which checks if a
device has a "dma-coherent" property to see if the device is coherent
for DMA.

But on some platforms devices are coherent by default, and on some
platforms it's not possible to update existing device trees to add the
"dma-coherent" property.

So add a Kconfig symbol to allow arch code to tell
of_dma_is_coherent() that devices are coherent by default, regardless
of the presence of the property.

Select that symbol on powerpc when NOT_COHERENT_CACHE is not set, ie.
when the system has a coherent cache.
