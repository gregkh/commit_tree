bpf: Return -EBADRQC for invalid map type in __bpf_tx_xdp_map

A negative value should be returned if map->map_type is invalid
although that is impossible now, but if we run into such situation
in future, then xdpbuff could be leaked.

Daniel Borkmann suggested:

-EBADRQC should be returned to stay consistent with generic XDP
for the tracepoint output and not to be confused with -EOPNOTSUPP
from other locations like dev_map_enqueue() when ndo_xdp_xmit is
missing and such.
