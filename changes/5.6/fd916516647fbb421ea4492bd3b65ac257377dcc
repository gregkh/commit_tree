arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Avoid "phy" for USB QMP PHY wrapper

The bindings for the QMP PHY are truly strange.  I believe (?) that
they may have originated because with PCIe each lane is treated as a
different PHY and the same PHY driver is used for a whole bunch of
things (incluidng PCIe).

In any case, now that we have "make dtbs_check", we find that having
the outer node named "phy" triggers the
"schemas/phy/phy-provider.yaml" schema, yelling about:

  phy@88e9000: '#phy-cells' is a required property

Let's call the outer node the "phy-wrapper" and the inner node the
"phy" to make dtbs_check happy.
