ALSA: hdspm: Drop linux/types.h inclusion in uapi header

The hdspm.h uapi header has been used also from non-Linux or platforms
that don't have linux/*.h.  It was OK in the past because alsa-lib
contained the modified version of this header file, but now it tries
to the verbatim copy, so it broke the build.  This fixes it again.
