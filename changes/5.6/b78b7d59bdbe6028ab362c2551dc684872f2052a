selinux: make default_noexec read-only after init

SELinux checks whether VM_EXEC is set in the VM_DATA_DEFAULT_FLAGS
during initialization and saves the result in default_noexec for use
in its mmap and mprotect hook function implementations to decide
whether to apply EXECMEM, EXECHEAP, EXECSTACK, and EXECMOD checks.
Mark default_noexec as ro_after_init to prevent later clearing it
and thereby disabling these checks.  It is only set legitimately from
init code.
