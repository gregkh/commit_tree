rcu: Replace synchronize_sched_expedited_wait() "_sched" with "_rcu"

After RCU flavor consolidation, synchronize_sched_expedited_wait() does
both RCU-preempt and RCU-sched, whichever happens to have been built into
the running kernel.  This commit therefore changes this function's name
to synchronize_rcu_expedited_wait() to reflect its new generic nature.
