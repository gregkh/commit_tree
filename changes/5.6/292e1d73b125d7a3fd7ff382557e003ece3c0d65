libbpf: Clean up bpf_helper_defs.h generation output

bpf_helpers_doc.py script, used to generate bpf_helper_defs.h, unconditionally
emits one informational message to stderr. Remove it and preserve stderr to
contain only relevant errors. Also make sure script invocations command is
muted by default in libbpf's Makefile.
