ASoC: soc-core: remove DAI suspend/resume

Historically, CPU and Codec were implemented different, but now it is
merged as Component.
ALSA SoC is supporting suspend/resume at DAI and Component level.
The method is like below.

	1) Suspend/Resume all CPU DAI if bus-control was 0
	2) Suspend/Resume all Component
	3) Suspend/Resume all CPU DAI if bus-control was 1

Historically 2) was Codec special operation.
Because CPU and Codec were merged into Component,
CPU   suspend/resume has 3 chance to suspend(= 1/2/3), but
Codec suspend/resume has 1 chance (= 2).

Here, DAI side suspend/resume is caring bus-control, but no driver
which is supporting suspend/resume is setting bus-control.
This means 3) was never used.

Here, used parameter for suspend/resume component->dev and dai->dev are
same pointer.
For that reason, we can merge DAI and Component suspend/resume.
One note is that we should use 2), because it is caring BIAS level.

This patch removes 1) and 3).
