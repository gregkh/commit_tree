tty/serial: Migrate atmel_serial to use has_sysrq

The SUPPORT_SYSRQ ifdeffery is not nice as:
- May create misunderstanding about sizeof(struct uart_port) between
  different objects
- Prevents moving functions from serial_core.h
- Reduces readability (well, it's ifdeffery - it's hard to follow)

In order to remove SUPPORT_SYSRQ, has_sysrq variable has been added.
Initialise it in driver's probe and remove ifdeffery.

While at it, remove forward-declaration of atmel_console - it wasn't
needed even at the moment the driver was first time introduced:
