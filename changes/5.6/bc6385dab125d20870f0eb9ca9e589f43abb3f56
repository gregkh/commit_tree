ext4: Move to shared i_rwsem even without dioread_nolock mount opt

We were using shared locking only in case of dioread_nolock mount option in case
of DIO overwrites. This mount condition is not needed anymore with current code,
since:-

1. No race between buffered writes & DIO overwrites. Since buffIO writes takes
exclusive lock & DIO overwrites will take shared locking. Also DIO path will
make sure to flush and wait for any dirty page cache data.

2. No race between buffered reads & DIO overwrites, since there is no block
allocation that is possible with DIO overwrites. So no stale data exposure
should happen. Same is the case between DIO reads & DIO overwrites.

3. Also other paths like truncate is protected, since we wait there for any DIO
in flight to be over.
