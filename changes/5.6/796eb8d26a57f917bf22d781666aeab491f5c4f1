efi/libstub/x86: Use const attribute for efi_is_64bit()

Reshuffle the x86 stub code a bit so that we can tag the efi_is_64bit()
function with the 'const' attribute, which permits the compiler to
optimize away any redundant calls. Since we have two different entry
points for 32 and 64 bit firmware in the startup code, this also
simplifies the C code since we'll enter it with the efi_is64 variable
already set.
