dt-bindings: display: bridge: lvds-transmitter: Absorb ti, ds90c185.txt

ti,ds90c185.txt documents LVDS encoders using the same driver
as the one documented by lvds-transmitter.yaml.
Since the properties listed in ti,ds90c185.txt are the same
as the ones listed in lvds-transmitter.yaml, absorb the dt-binding
into lvds-transmitter.yaml.
