spi: uniphier: Add DMA transfer mode support

This adds DMA transfer mode support for UniPhier SPI controller.

Since this controller requires simulteaneous transmission and reception,
this indicates SPI_CONTROLLER_MUST_RX and SPI_CONTROLLER_MUST_TX.

Because the supported dma controller has alignment restiction,
there is also a restriction that 'maxburst' parameters in dma_slave_config
corresponds to one word width.
