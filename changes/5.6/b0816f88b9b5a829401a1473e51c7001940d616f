serial: ucc_uart: limit brg-frequency workaround to PPC32

According to Timur Tabi

    This bug in older U-Boots is definitely PowerPC-specific

So before allowing this driver to be built for platforms other than
PPC32, make sure that we don't accept malformed device trees on those
other platforms.
