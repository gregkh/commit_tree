KVM: PPC: Book3S: Replace current->mm by kvm->mm

Given that in kvm_create_vm() there is:
kvm->mm = current->mm;

And that on every kvm_*_ioctl we have:
if (kvm->mm != current->mm)
	return -EIO;

I see no reason to keep using current->mm instead of kvm->mm.

By doing so, we would reduce the use of 'global' variables on code, relying
more in the contents of kvm struct.
