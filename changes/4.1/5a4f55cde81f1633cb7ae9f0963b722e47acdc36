KVM: x86: cache maxphyaddr CPUID leaf in struct kvm_vcpu

cpuid_maxphyaddr(), which performs lot of memory accesses is called
extensively across KVM, especially in nVMX code.

This patch adds a cached value of maxphyaddr to vcpu.arch to reduce the
pressure onto CPU cache and simplify the code of cpuid_maxphyaddr()
callers. The cached value is initialized in kvm_arch_vcpu_init() and
reloaded every time CPUID is updated by usermode. It is obvious that
these reloads occur infrequently.
