mnt: Fix the error check in __detach_mounts

lookup_mountpoint can return either NULL or an error value.
Update the test in __detach_mounts to test for an error value
to avoid pathological cases causing a NULL pointer dereferences.

The callers of __detach_mounts should prevent it from ever being
called on an unlinked dentry but don't take any chances.
