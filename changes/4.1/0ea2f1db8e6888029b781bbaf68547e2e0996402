hwmon: (jc42) Add support for additional IDT temperature sensors

TS3000GB0 has a new device ID (0x2913). Since IDT's datasheets suggest
that the upper 8 bit of the device ID reflect the chip ID and the lower
8 bit reflect the version number, modify the code to accept all chips
with ID 0x29xx.

Also add support for TS3001 and TSE2004.

Some of the datasheets for older chips are no longer available from
the IDT web site, so replace explicit links in the documentation with
a generic note.
