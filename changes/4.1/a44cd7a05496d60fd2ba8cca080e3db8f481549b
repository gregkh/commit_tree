ext4 crypto: add padding to filenames before encrypting

This obscures the length of the filenames, to decrease the amount of
information leakage.  By default, we pad the filenames to the next 4
byte boundaries.  This costs nothing, since the directory entries are
aligned to 4 byte boundaries anyway.  Filenames can also be padded to
8, 16, or 32 bytes, which will consume more directory space.
