drm/i915: Do not use ggtt_view with (aliasing) PPGTT

GGTT views are only applicable when dealing with GGTT. Change the code to
reject ggtt_view where it should not be used and require it when it should
be.

v2:
- Dropped _ppgtt_ infixes, allow both types to be passed
- Disregard other but normal views when no view is specified
- More checks that valid parameters are passed
- More readable error checking

v3:
- Prefer WARN_ONCE over BUG_ON when there is code path for failure
