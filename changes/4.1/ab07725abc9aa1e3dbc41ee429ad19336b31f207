drm/panel: Add display timing for HannStar HSD070PWW1

The HannStar HSD070PWW1 LVDS panel data sheet lists allowed ranges
additionally to the typical values for pixel clock rate (64.3-82 MHz)
and blanking intervals (54-681 clock cycles horizontally, 3-23 lines
vertically).

This patch replaces this panel's display mode with the display timing
information to describe acceptable timings. Since the HSYNC and VSYNC
are unused, the distribution between front porches, back porches, and
sync pulse lengths was chosen at will.
