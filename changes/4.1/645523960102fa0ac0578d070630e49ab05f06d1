perf/x86/intel/rapl: Fix energy counter measurements but supporing per domain energy units

RAPL energy hardware unit can vary within a single CPU package, e.g.
HSW server DRAM has a fixed energy unit of 15.3 uJ (2^-16) whereas
the unit on other domains can be enumerated from power unit MSR.

There might be other variations in the future, this patch adds
per cpu model quirk to allow special handling of certain cpus.

hw_unit is also removed from per cpu data since it is not per cpu
and the sampling rate for energy counter is typically not high.

Without this patch, DRAM domain on HSW servers will be counted
4x higher than the real energy counter.
