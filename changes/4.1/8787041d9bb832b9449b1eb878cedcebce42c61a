ASoC: wm8741: Fix rates constraints values

The WM8741 DAC supports the following typical audio sampling rates:
  44.1kHz, 88.2kHz, 176.4kHz (eg: with a master clock of 22.5792MHz)
  32kHz, 48kHz, 96kHz, 192kHz (eg: with a master clock of 24.576MHz)

For the rates lists, we should use 82000 instead of 88235, 176400
instead of 1764000 and 192000 instead of 19200 (seems to be a typo).
