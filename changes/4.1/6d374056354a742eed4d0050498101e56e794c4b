perf/x86/intel: Fix SLM cache event list

iTLB-load-misses and LLC-load-misses count incorrectly on SLM.

There is no ITLB.MISSES support on SLM. Event PAGE_WALKS.I_SIDE_WALK
should be used to count iTLB-load-misses. This event counts when an
instruction (I) page walk is completed or started. Since a page walk
implies a TLB miss, the number of TLB misses can be counted by counting
the number of pagewalks.

DMND_DATA_RD counts both demand and DCU prefetch data reads. However,
LLC-load-misses should only count demand reads. There is no way to not
include prefetches with a single counter on SLM. So the LLC-load-misses
support should be removed on SLM.
