spi: dw-mid: split dma_setup() from dma_transfer()

The patch splits DMA preparatory code to dma_setup() callback. The change also
converts transfer_one() to program DMA whenever the transfer is DMA mapped. The
change is a follow up of the converion to use SPI core transfer_one_message().
Since the DMA mapped transfers can be interleaved with PIO ones the DMA related
configuration should respect that.
