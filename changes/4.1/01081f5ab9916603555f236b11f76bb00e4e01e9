coresight: moving to new "hwtracing" directory

Keeping drivers related to HW tracing on ARM, i.e coresight,
under "drivers/coresight" doesn't make sense when other
architectures start rolling out technologies of the same
nature.

As such creating a new "drivers/hwtracing" directory where all
drivers of the same kind can reside, reducing namespace
pollution under "drivers/".
