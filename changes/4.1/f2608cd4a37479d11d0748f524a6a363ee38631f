s390/dasd: fix inability to set a DASD device offline

Fix ref counting for DASD devices leading to an inability to set a
DASD device offline.
Before a worker is scheduled the DASD device driver takes a reference
to the device. If the worker was already scheduled this reference was
never freed.
Fix by giving the reference to the DASD device free when
schedule_work() returns false.
