[media] V4L: add CCF support to the v4l2_clk API

V4L2 clocks, e.g. used by camera sensors for their master clock, do not
have to be supplied by a different V4L2 driver, they can also be
supplied by an independent source. In this case the standart kernel
clock API should be used to handle such clocks. This patch adds support
for such cases.
