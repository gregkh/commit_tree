selinux: increase avtab max buckets

Now that we can safely increase the avtab max buckets without
triggering high order allocations and have a hash function that
will make better use of the larger number of buckets, increase
the max buckets to 2^16.

Original:
101421 entries and 2048/2048 buckets used, longest chain length 374

With new hash function:
101421 entries and 2048/2048 buckets used, longest chain length 81

With increased max buckets:
101421 entries and 31078/32768 buckets used, longest chain length 12
