mwifiex: add SDIO rx single port aggregation

This patch brings in support for SDIO single port rx aggregation
to mwifiex.
Maximum read size support by SDIO cmd53 is 64K.
Based on multi port aggregation which is already part of mwifiex, idea here
is multiple packets received in FW can be aggregated into single buffer.
A separate upload type is defined for such packet aggregated to single port.
Packets from this single buffer are later deaggregated into individual packets.
This way, driver can receive more packets each time through single SDIO cmd53;
thereby reducing no of times MMC bus is accessed.

SDIO SP aggregation support is advertised by FW during load time and driver
would get FW block size in command response of HostCmd_CMD_SDIO_SP_RX_AGGR_CFG.
