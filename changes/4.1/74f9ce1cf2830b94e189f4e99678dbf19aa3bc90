xfs: use percpu_counter_read_positive for mp->m_icount

Function percpu_counter_read just return the current counter, which can be
negative. This will cause the checking of "allocated inode
counts <= m_maxicount" false positive. Use percpu_counter_read_positive can
solve this problem, and be consistent with the purpose to introduce percpu
mechanism to xfs.
