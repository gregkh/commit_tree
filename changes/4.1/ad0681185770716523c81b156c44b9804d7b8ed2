xen-netfront: properly destroy queues when removing device

xennet_remove() freed the queues before freeing the netdevice which
results in a use-after-free when free_netdev() tries to delete the
napi instances that have already been freed.

Fix this by fully destroy the queues (which includes deleting the napi
instances) before freeing the netdevice.
