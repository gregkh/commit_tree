s390/dasd: Fix unresumed device after suspend/resume having no paths

The DASD device driver prevents I/O from being started on stopped
devices. This also prevented channel paths to be verified and so
the device was unable to be resumed.
Fix by allowing path verification requests on stopped devices.
