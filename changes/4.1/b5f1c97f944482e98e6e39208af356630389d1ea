drm/i915: vlv: fix save/restore of GFX_MAX_REQ_COUNT reg

Due this typo we don't save/restore the GFX_MAX_REQ_COUNT register across
suspend/resume, so fix this.

    drm/i915: vlv: add runtime PM support

I noticed this only by reading the code. To my knowledge it shouldn't
cause any real problems at the moment, since the power well backing this
register remains on across a runtime s/r. This may change once
system-wide s0ix functionality is enabled in the kernel.

v2:
- resend after a missing git add -u :/
