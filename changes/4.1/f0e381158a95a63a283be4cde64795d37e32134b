sc16is7xx: expose RTS inversion in RS-485 mode

Hardware is capable of inverting RTS signal when working
in RS-485 mode.  Expose this functionality to user space.
Relay on a matching combination of standard flags
(SER_RS485_RTS_ON_SEND and SER_RS485_RTS_AFTER_SEND) to
detect when user space is requesting inverted RTS mode.
