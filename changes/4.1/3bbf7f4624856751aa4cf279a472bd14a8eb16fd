linux/cpumask.h: add typechecking to cpumask_test_cpu

The Subtlety (1) referred to vanished with 6ba2ef7baac2 ("cpumask:
Move deprecated functions to end of header."). That used to mention
some suboptimal code generation by a, by now, rather ancient gcc. With
gcc 4.7, I don't see any change in the generated code by making it a
static inline, so let's add type checking and get rid of the ghost
reference.
