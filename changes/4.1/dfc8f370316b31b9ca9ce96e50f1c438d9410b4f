net/tg3: Release IRQs on permanent error

When having permanent EEH error, the PCI device will be removed
from the system. For this case, we shouldn't set pcierr_recovery
to true wrongly, which blocks the driver to release the allocated
interrupts and their handlers. Eventually, we can't disable MSI
or MSIx successfully because of the MSI or MSIx interrupts still
have associated interrupt actions, which is turned into following
stack dump.
