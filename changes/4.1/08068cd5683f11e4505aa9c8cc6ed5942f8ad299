net/mlx4: Added qos_vport QP configuration in VST mode

Granular QoS per VF feature introduce a new QP field, qos_vport.

PF administrator can connect VF QPs to a certain QoS Vport, to
inherit its proporties. Connecting QPs to the default QoS Vport
(defined as 0) is always allowed, even when there are no allocated VPPs.
At this point, only the default vport is connected to QPs.
