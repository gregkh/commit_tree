ALSA: emu10k1: don't deadlock in proc-functions

The functions snd_emu10k1_proc_spdif_read and snd_emu1010_fpga_read
acquire the emu_lock before accessing the FPGA. The function used
to access the FPGA (snd_emu1010_fpga_read) also tries to take
the emu_lock which causes a deadlock.
Remove the outer locking in the proc-functions (guarding only the
already safe fpga read) to prevent this deadlock.

[removed superfluous flags variables too -- tiwai]
