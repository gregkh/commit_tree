bgmac: register fixed PHY for ARM BCM470X / BCM5301X chipsets

On ARM SoCs with bgmac Ethernet hardware we don't have any normal PHY.
There is always a switch attached but it's not even controlled over MDIO
like in case of MIPS devices.
We need a fixed PHY to be able to send/receive packets from the switch.
