openvswitch: disable LRO

Currently, openvswitch tries to disable LRO from the user space. This does
not work correctly when the device added is a vlan interface, though.
Instead of dealing with possibly complex stacked cross name space relations
in the user space, do the same as bridging does and call dev_disable_lro in
the kernel.
