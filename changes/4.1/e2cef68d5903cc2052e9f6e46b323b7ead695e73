ASoC: rt286: add jack detection disable with NULL jack passed

Some platforms, e.g. WSB, don't need jack detection when
system is in Suspend, for power save reason.

Here add headphone/mic jack detection disable feature with NULL
jack passed in, when disabled, it will disable interrupt, and
disable LDO1, which is used for jack detection when headphone
is plugged in.
