usb: phy: ab8500-usb: Pass the IRQF_ONESHOT flag

Since commit 1c6c69525b40 ("genirq: Reject bogus threaded irq requests")
threaded IRQs without a primary handler need to be requested with
IRQF_ONESHOT, otherwise the request will fail.

So pass the IRQF_ONESHOT flag in this case.

The semantic patch that makes this change is available
in scripts/coccinelle/misc/irqf_oneshot.cocci.
