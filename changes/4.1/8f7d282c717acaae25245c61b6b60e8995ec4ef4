zram: deprecate zram attrs sysfs nodes

Add Documentation/ABI/obsolete/sysfs-block-zram file and list obsolete and
deprecated attributes there.  The patch also adds additional information
to zram documentation and describes the basic strategy:

- the existing RW nodes will be downgraded to WO nodes (in 4.11)
- deprecated RO sysfs nodes will eventually be removed (in 4.11)

Users will be additionally notified about deprecated attr usage by
pr_warn_once() (added to every deprecated attr _show()), as suggested by
Minchan Kim.

User space is advised to use zram<id>/stat, zram<id>/io_stat and
zram<id>/mm_stat files.
