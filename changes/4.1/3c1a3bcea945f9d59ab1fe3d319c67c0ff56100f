s390/maccess: improve s390_kernel_write()

Use the sturg instruction instead of the stura instruction. This allows to
modify up to eight bytes in a row instead of only four.

For function tracer enabling and disabling this reduces the time needed to
modify the text sections by 50%, since for each mcount call site six bytes
need to be changed.

Also remove the EXTABLE entries, since calls to this function are not
supposed to fail.
