samples/pktgen: Add sample scripts for pktgen facility

These are Robert Olsson's samples which used to be available from
<ftp://robur.slu.se/pub/Linux/net-development/pktgen-testing/examples/>
but currently are not.

Change the documentation to refer to these consistently as 'sample
scripts', matching the directory name used here.
