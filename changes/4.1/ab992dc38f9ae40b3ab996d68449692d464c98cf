watchdog: Fix merge 'conflict'

Two watchdog changes that came through different trees had a non
conflicting conflict, that is, one changed the semantics of a variable
but no actual code conflict happened. So the merge appeared fine, but
the resulting code did not behave as expected.

Commit 195daf665a62 ("watchdog: enable the new user interface of the
watchdog mechanism") changes the semantics of watchdog_user_enabled,
which thereafter is only used by the functions introduced by
b3738d293233 ("watchdog: Add watchdog enable/disable all functions").

There further appears to be a distinct lack of serialization between
setting and using watchdog_enabled, so perhaps we should wrap the
{en,dis}able_all() things in watchdog_proc_mutex.

This patch fixes a s2r failure reported by Michal; which I cannot
readily explain. But this does make the code internally consistent
again.
