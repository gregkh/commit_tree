x86/fpu: Don't reset thread.fpu_counter

The "else" branch clears ->fpu_counter as a remnant of the lazy FPU
usage counting:

  e07e23e1fd30 ("[PATCH] non lazy "sleazy" fpu implementation")

However, switch_fpu_prepare() does this now so that else branch is
superfluous.

If we do use_eager_fpu(), then this has no effect. Otherwise, if we
actually wanted to prevent fpu preload after the context switch we would
need to reset it unconditionally, even if __thread_has_fpu().
