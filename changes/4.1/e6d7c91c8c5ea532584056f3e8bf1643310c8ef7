perf probe: Fix to get ummapped symbol address on kernel

Fix to get correctly unmapped symbol address on kernel.  This allows us
to probe on syscall symbols which are aliases of SyS_ functions with
using debuginfo.

Without this fix:
  ----
  # ./perf probe -a sys_write
  Failed to find debug information for address 3b0100
  Probe point 'sys_write' not found.
    Error: Failed to add events.
  ----
The address 0x3b0100 is a mapped address, and not usable
in debuginfo.

With this fix:
  ----
  # ./perf probe -a sys_write
  Added new event:
    probe:sys_write      (on sys_write)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

          perf record -e probe:sys_write -aR sleep 1
