drm/i915: Ensure plane->state->fb stays in sync with plane->fb

plane->state->fb and plane->fb should always reference the same FB so
that atomic and legacy codepaths have the same view of display state.

            drm/i915: Keep plane->state updated on pageflip

we already fixed one case where these two pointers could get out of
sync.  However it turns out there are a few other places (mainly dealing
with initial FB setup at boot) that directly set plane->fb and neglect
to update plane->state->fb.  If we never do a successful update through
the atomic pipeline, the RmFB cleanup code will look at the
plane->state->fb pointer, which has never actually been set to a
legitimate value, and try to clean it up, leading to BUG's.

Add a quick helper function to synchronize plane->state->fb with
plane->fb (and update reference counts accordingly) and call it
everywhere the driver tries to manually set plane->fb outside of the
atomic pipeline.
