ASoC: Intel: Refactor common IPC/mailbox code into generic APIs

Currently in Intel SST driver, some similar IPC/mailbox processing
code are used in different platforms (e.g. in baytrail/broadwell).

This patch extracts the common code and creates new files
(sst-ipc.c/sst-ipc.h) to contain the common code and provide the generic
APIs for IPC/mailbox processing.
