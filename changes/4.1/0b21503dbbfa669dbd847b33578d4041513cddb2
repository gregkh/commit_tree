clk: qcom: fix RCG M/N counter configuration

Currently, a RCG's M/N counter (used for fraction division) is
set to either 'bypass' (counter disabled) or 'dual edge' (counter
enabled) based on whether the corresponding rcg struct has a mnd
field specified and a non-zero N.

In the case where M and N are the same value, the M/N counter is
still enabled by code even though no division takes place.
Leaving the RCG in such a state can result in improper behavior.
This was observed with the DSI pixel clock RCG when M and N were
both set to 1.

Add an additional check (M != N) to enable the M/N counter only
when it's needed for fraction division.
