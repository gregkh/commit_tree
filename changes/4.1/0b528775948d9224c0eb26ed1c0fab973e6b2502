staging: fsl-mc: Removed reordering of MC objects during bus scan

MC objects discovered during an MC bus scan were being reordered
to ensure that all allocatable objects are probed before all
non-allocatable objects. However, this is not necessary, as
drivers of non-allocatable objects, that allocate allocatable
objects in their probe function, can return -EPROBE_DEFER
if such allocations fail.
