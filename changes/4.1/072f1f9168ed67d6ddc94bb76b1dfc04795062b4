drm/msm: add support for "stolen" mem

Add support to use the VRAM carveout (if specified in dtb) for fbdev
scanout buffer.  This allows drm/msm to take over a bootloader splash-
screen, and avoids corruption on screen that results if the kernel uses
memory that is still being scanned out for itself.
