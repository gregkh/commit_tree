be2net: move adapter fields alloc/free code to new routines

The members of be_adapter struct were being allocated in two separate
routines -- be_ctrl_init() and be_stats_init(). Also, some other members
were allocated elsewhere. This patch moves the alloc/free code into
be_drv_init/cleanup() routines. The be_pci_map_bars() routine that was
called from be_ctrl_init() is now called directly from be_probe().
The new routine be_drv_init() will now be the place-holder for allocating
memory for any new be_adapter{} members in the future.
Some routines needed to be moved to provide forward definitions for their
calls.
