locking/futex: Check PF_KTHREAD rather than !p->mm to filter out kthreads

attach_to_pi_owner() checks p->mm to prevent attaching to kthreads and
this looks doubly wrong:

1. It should actually check PF_KTHREAD, kthread can do use_mm().

2. If this task is not kthread and it is actually the lock owner we can
   wrongly return -EPERM instead of -ESRCH or retry-if-EAGAIN.

   And note that this wrong EPERM is the likely case unless the exiting
   task is (auto)reaped quickly, we check ->mm before PF_EXITING.
