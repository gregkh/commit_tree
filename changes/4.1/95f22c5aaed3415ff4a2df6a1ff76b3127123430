[media] lgdt3306a: Minor source code cleanups

Fix a few minor CodingStyle issues at the source code:
	- Use proper multi-line comments;
	- Align the log tables;
	- Remove the .type from dvb_frontend_ops, since this is not
	  needed anymore (since the drivers conversion to DVBv5);
	- Remove emacs format macro.
