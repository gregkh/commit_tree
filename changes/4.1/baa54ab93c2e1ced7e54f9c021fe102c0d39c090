nios2: rework trap handler

Redefine trap handler as below:

 0  N/A        reserved for system calls
 1  SIGUSR1    user-defined signal 1
 2  SIGUSR2    user-defined signal 2
 3  SIGILL     illegal instruction
 4..29         reserved (but implemented to raise SIGILL instead of being undefined)
30  SIGTRAP    KGDB
31  SIGTRAP    trace/breakpoint trap
