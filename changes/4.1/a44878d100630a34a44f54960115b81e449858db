IB/ipoib: Use one linear skb in RX flow

The current code in the RX flow uses two sg entries for each incoming
packet, the first one was for the IB headers and the second for the rest
of the data, that causes two  dma map/unmap and two allocations, and few
more actions that were done at the data path.

Use only one linear skb on each incoming packet, for the data (IB
headers and payload), that reduces the packet processing in the
data-path (only one skb, no frags, the first frag was not used anyway,
less memory allocations) and the dma handling (only one dma map/unmap
over each incoming packet instead of two map/unmap per each incoming packet).

After commit 73d3fe6d1c6d ("gro: fix aggregation for skb using frag_list") from
Eric Dumazet, we will get full aggregation for large packets.

When running bandwidth tests before and after the (over the card's numa node),
using "netperf -H 1.1.1.3 -T -t TCP_STREAM", the results before are ~12Gbs before
and after ~16Gbs on my setup (Mellanox's ConnectX3).
