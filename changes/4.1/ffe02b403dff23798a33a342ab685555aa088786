drm/i915: Introduce intel_set_rps()

Replace the valleyview_set_rps() and gen6_set_rps() calls with
intel_set_rps() which itself does the IS_VALLEYVIEW() check. The
code becomes simpler since the callers don't have to do this check
themselves.

Most of the change was performe with the following semantic patch:
@@
expression E1, E2, E3;
@@
- if (IS_VALLEYVIEW(E1)) {
-  valleyview_set_rps(E2, E3);
- } else {
-  gen6_set_rps(E2, E3);
- }
+ intel_set_rps(E2, E3);

Adding intel_set_rps() and making valleyview_set_rps() and gen6_set_rps()
static was done manually. Also valleyview_set_rps() had to be moved a
bit avoid a forward declaration.

v2: Use a less greedy semantic patch
