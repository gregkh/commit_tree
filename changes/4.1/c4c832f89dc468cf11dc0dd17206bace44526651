bridge: disable softirqs around br_fdb_update to avoid lockup

br_fdb_update() can be called in process context in the following way:
br_fdb_add() -> __br_fdb_add() -> br_fdb_update() (if NTF_USE flag is set)
so we need to disable softirqs because there are softirq users of the
hash_lock. One easy way to reproduce this is to modify the bridge utility
to set NTF_USE, enable stp and then set maxageing to a low value so
br_fdb_cleanup() is called frequently and then just add new entries in
a loop. This happens because br_fdb_cleanup() is called from timer/softirq
context. The spin locks in br_fdb_update were _bh before commit f8ae737deea1
("[BRIDGE]: forwarding remove unneeded preempt and bh diasables")
and at the time that commit was correct because br_fdb_update() couldn't be
called from process context, but that changed after commit:
292d1398983f ("bridge: add NTF_USE support")
Using local_bh_disable/enable around br_fdb_update() allows us to keep
using the spin_lock/unlock in br_fdb_update for the fast-path.
