signal: remove warning about using SI_TKILL in rt_[tg]sigqueueinfo

Sending SI_TKILL from rt_[tg]sigqueueinfo was deprecated, so now we issue
a warning on the first attempt of doing it.  We use WARN_ON_ONCE, which is
not informative and, what is worse, taints the kernel, making the trinity
syscall fuzzer complain false-positively from time to time.

It does not look like we need this warning at all, because the behaviour
changed quite a long time ago (2.6.39), and if an application relies on
the old API, it gets EPERM anyway and can issue a warning by itself.

So let us zap the warning in kernel.
