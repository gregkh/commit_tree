dm: only run the queue on completion if congested or no requests pending

On really fast storage it can be beneficial to delay running the
request_queue to allow the elevator more opportunity to merge requests.

Otherwise, it has been observed that requests are being sent to
q->request_fn much quicker than is ideal on IOPS-bound backends.
