mtd: atmel_nand: check NFC busy flag by HSMC_SR instead of NFC cmd regs

Currently the driver read NFC command registers to get NFC busy flag.
Actually this flag also can be get by reading HSMC_SR register.

Use the read NFC command registers need mapping a huge memory region.
To save the mapped memory region, we change to check NFC busy flag by
reading HSMC_SR register.
