UBI: Fastmap: Locking updates

a) Rename ubi->fm_sem to ubi->fm_eba_sem as this semaphore
protects EBA changes.
b) Turn ubi->fm_mutex into a rw semaphore. It will still serialize
fastmap writes but also ensures that ubi_wl_put_peb() is not
interrupted by a fastmap write. We use a rw semaphore to allow
ubi_wl_put_peb() still to be executed in parallel if no fastmap
write is happening.
