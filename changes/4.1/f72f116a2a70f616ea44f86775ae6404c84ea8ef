cxgb4: drop __GFP_NOFAIL allocation

set_filter_wr is requesting __GFP_NOFAIL allocation although it can return
ENOMEM without any problems obviously (t4_l2t_set_switching does that
already).  So the non-failing requirement is too strong without any
obvious reason.  Drop __GFP_NOFAIL and reorganize the code to have the
failure paths easier.

The same applies to _c4iw_write_mem_dma_aligned which uses __GFP_NOFAIL
and then checks the return value and returns -ENOMEM on failure.  This
doesn't make any sense what so ever.  Either the allocation cannot fail or
it can.

del_filter_wr seems to be safe as well because the filter entry is not
marked as pending and the return value is propagated up the stack up to
c4iw_destroy_listen.
