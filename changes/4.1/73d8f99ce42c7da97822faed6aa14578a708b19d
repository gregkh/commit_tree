MIPS: Fix wrong CHECKFLAGS (sparse builds) with GCC 5.1

GCC 5.1 defines __REGISTER_PREFIX__ to $. This will break sparse
command line (and build fails with: /bin/sh: syntax error:
unexpected "(") since make tries to expand starting with the dollar
sign with a make variable. Prevent that by using double dollar sign.
