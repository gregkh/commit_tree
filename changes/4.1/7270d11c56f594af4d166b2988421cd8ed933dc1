arm/bL_switcher: Kill tick suspend hackery

Use the new tick_suspend/resume_local() and get rid of the
homebrewn implementation of these in the ARM bL switcher.  The
check for the cpumask is completely pointless.  There is no harm
to suspend a per cpu tick device unconditionally.  If that's a
real issue then we fix it proper at the core level and not with
some completely undocumented hacks in some random core code.

Move the tick internals to the core code, now that this nuisance
is gone.
