drm: omapdrm: Remove manual update display support

All the manual update display code implements eventually ends up to just
calls to omap_connector_flush(), currently implemented as an empty TODO
stub. Remove it, the code can always be revived and implemented later if
interest in manual update displays becomes a reality.
