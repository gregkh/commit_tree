microblaze: use asm-generic for seccomp.h

Switch to using the newly created asm-generic/seccomp.h for the seccomp
strict mode syscall definitions. Since microblaze is 32-bit, the COMPAT
seccomp defines are unused and can be dropped. The obsolete sigreturn
for seccomp strict mode is retained as an override. Remaining definitions
are identical.
