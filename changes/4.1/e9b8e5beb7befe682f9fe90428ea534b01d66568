crypto: api - Move alg ref count init to crypto_check_alg

We currently initialise the crypto_alg ref count in the function
__crypto_register_alg.  As one of the callers of that function
crypto_register_instance needs to obtain a ref count before it
calls __crypto_register_alg, we need to move the initialisation
out of there.

Since both callers of __crypto_register_alg call crypto_check_alg,
this is the logical place to perform the initialisation.
