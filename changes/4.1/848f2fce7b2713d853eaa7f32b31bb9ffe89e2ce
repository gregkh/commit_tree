staging: sm750fb: fix undeclared function

kbuild test robot reported that for microblaze-allyesconfig
chan_to_field() and lynxfb_ops_set_par() were not defined. These two
functions were defined under CONFIG_PM, so for any archtecture if
CONFIG_PM is not defined we will have this error.

while moving the lynxfb_suspend() function some very obvious
checkpatch errors, like space after comma, space after if, space
before opening brace, were taken care of.
