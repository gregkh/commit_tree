dm: add 'use_blk_mq' module param and expose in per-device ro sysfs attr

Request-based DM's blk-mq support defaults to off; but a user can easily
change the default using the dm_mod.use_blk_mq module/boot option.

Also, you can check what mode a given request-based DM device is using
with: cat /sys/block/dm-X/dm/use_blk_mq

This change enabled further cleanup and reduced work (e.g. the
md->io_pool and md->rq_pool isn't created if using blk-mq).
