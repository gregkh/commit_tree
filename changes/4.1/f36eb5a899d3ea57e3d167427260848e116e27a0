drm/omap: add pin refcounting to omap_framebuffer

omap_framebuffer_pin() and omap_framebuffer_unpin() are currently
broken, as they cannot be called multiple times (i.e. pin, pin, unpin,
unpin), which is what happens in certain cases. This issue causes the
driver to possibly use 0 as an address for a displayed buffer, leading
to OCP error from DSS.

This patch fixes the issue by adding a simple pin_count, used to track
the number of pins.
