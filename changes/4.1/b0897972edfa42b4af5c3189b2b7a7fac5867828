ARM: OMAP2+: Remove bogus struct clk comparison for timer clock

With recent changes to use determine_rate, the comparison of two
clocks won't work without clk_is_match that does __clk_get_hw
on the clocks first.

As we've been unconditionally already calling clk_set_parent
already because of the bogus comparison, let's just remove the
check as suggested by Stephen Boyd <sboyd@codeaurora.org>.
