perf test: Fix dso cache testcase

The current dso cache permits to keep dso->data.fd is open under a half
of open file limit.  But test__dso_data_cache() sets dso_cnt to limit /
2 + 1 so it'll reach the limit in the loop even though the loop count is
one less than the dso_cnt and it makes the final dso__data_fd() after
the loop meaningless.

I guess the intention was dsos[0]->data.fd is open before the last open
and gets closed after it.  So add an assert before the last open.
