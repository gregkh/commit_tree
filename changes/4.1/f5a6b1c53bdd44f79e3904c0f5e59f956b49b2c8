btrfs: qgroup: allow to remove qgroup which has parent but no child.

When a qgroup has parents but no child, it should be removable in
Theory I think. But currently, we can not remove it when it has
either parent or child.

Example:
	# btrfs quota enable /mnt
	# btrfs qgroup create 1/0 /mnt
	# btrfs qgroup create 2/0 /mnt
	# btrfs qgroup assign 1/0 2/0 /mnt
	# btrfs qgroup show -pcre /mnt
qgroupid rfer  excl  max_rfer max_excl parent  child
-------- ----  ----  -------- -------- ------  -----
0/5      16384 16384 0        0        ---     ---
1/0      0     0     0        0        2/0     ---
2/0      0     0     0        0        ---     1/0

At this time, there is no subvol or qgroup depending on it.
Just a qgroup 2/0 is its parent, but 2/0 can work well without
1/0. So I think 1/0 should be removalbe. But:
	# btrfs qgroup destroy 1/0 /mnt
ERROR: unable to destroy quota group: Device or resource busy

This patch remove the check of qgroup->parent in removing it,
then we can remove a qgroup when it has a parent.
