ARM: 8347/1: dma-mapping: fix off-by-one check in arm_setup_iommu_dma_ops

Patch 22b3c181c6c324a46f71aae806d8ddbe61d25761 ("arm: dma-mapping: limit
IOMMU mapping size") added a check for IO address space size. However
this patch broke IOMMU initialization for typical platforms initialized
from device tree, which get the default IO address space size of 4GiB.
This value doesn't fit into size_t and fails a check introduced by that
commit resulting in failed dma-mapping/iommu initialization. This patch
fixes this issue by adding proper support for full 4GiB address space
size.
