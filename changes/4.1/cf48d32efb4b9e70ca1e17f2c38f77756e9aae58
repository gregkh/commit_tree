mmc: sdhci-st: Add sdhci_st_set_uhs_signaling function.

To allow UHS modes to work properly we need to provide the st specific
set_uhs_signaling callback function. This function differs from the
generic sdhci_set_uhs_signaling callback in that we need to configure
the correct delay depending on the UHS mode, and also set the V18_EN
bit.
