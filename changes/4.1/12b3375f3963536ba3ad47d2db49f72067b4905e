mlx4/mlx5: Use dma_wmb/rmb where appropriate

This patch should help to improve the performance of the mlx4 and mlx5 on a
number of architectures.  For example, on x86 the dma_wmb/rmb equates out
to a barrer() call as the architecture is already strong ordered, and on
PowerPC the call works out to a lwsync which is significantly less expensive
than the sync call that was being used for wmb.

I placed the new barriers between any spots that seemed to be trying to
order memory/memory reads or writes, if there are any spots that involved
MMIO I left the existing wmb in place as the new barriers cannot order
transactions between coherent and non-coherent memories.

v2: Reduced the replacments to just the spots where I could clearly
    identify the usage pattern.
