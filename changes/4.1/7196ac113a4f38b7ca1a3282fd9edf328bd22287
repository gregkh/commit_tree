Fix to check Unique id and FileType when client refer file directly.

When you refer file directly on cifs client,
 (e.g. ls -li <filename>, cd <dir>, stat <filename>)
 the function return old inode number and filetype from old inode cache,
 though server has different inode number or filetype.

When server is Windows, cifs client has same problem.
When Server is Windows
, This patch fixes bug in different filetype,
  but does not fix bug in different inode number.
Because QUERY_PATH_INFO response by Windows does not include inode number(Index Number) .
