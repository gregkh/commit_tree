Revert "mmc: core: Convert mmc_driver to device_driver"

This reverts commit 6685ac62b2f0 ("mmc: core: Convert mmc_driver to
device_driver")

The reverted commit went too far in simplifing the device driver parts
for mmc.

Let's restore the old mmc_driver to enable driver core to sooner
or later to remove the ->probe(), ->remove() and ->shutdown() callbacks
from the struct device_driver.

Note that, the old ->suspend|resume() callbacks in the struct
mmc_driver don't need to be restored, since the mmc block layer has
converted to the modern system PM ops.
