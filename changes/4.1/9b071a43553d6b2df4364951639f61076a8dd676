ideapad_laptop: Add Lenovo G40-30 to devices without radio switch

Lenovo G40-30 does not provide any physical radio switch to user.
Therefore disable the rfkill switch identically to the Yoga 2 approach.
(Note for later, models ids are sorted alphabetically).

Benefit is to make wireless available again without unloading module.

It was tested successfully on 4.1.0-rc1 base with this model:
(LENOVO_MT_80FY_BU_idea_FM_Lenovo G40-30).
