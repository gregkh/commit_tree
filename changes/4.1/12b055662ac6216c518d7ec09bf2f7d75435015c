[media] s5p-jpeg: Initialize jpeg_addr fields to zero

JPEG codecs on Exynos4 and Exynos3250 SoCs utilize different number
of planes for storing the raw image data, depending on the format
of the image being processed. For the unused planes a random data
was being written to the related registers. Regardless of the fact
that this seemed not to be harmful, fix the issue for clarity reasons.
