MIPS: Add support for XPA.

Add support for extended physical addressing (XPA) so that
32-bit platforms can access equal to or greater than 40 bits
of physical addresses.

NOTE:
      1) XPA and EVA are not the same and cannot be used
         simultaneously.
      2) If you configure your kernel for XPA, the PTEs
         and all address sizes become 64-bit.
      3) Your platform MUST have working HIGHMEM support.
