ARM: OMAP2+: Fix omap off idle power consumption creeping up

If we use a combination of VMODE and I2C4 for retention modes,
eventually the off idle power consumption will creep up by about
23mW, even during off mode with I2C4 always staying enabled.

Turns out this is because of erratum i531 "Extra Power Consumed
When Repeated Start Operation Mode Is Enabled on I2C Interface
Dedicated for Smart Reflex (I2C4)" as pointed out by Nishanth
Menon <nm@ti.com>.

Let's fix the issue by adding i2c_cfg_clear_mask for the bits
to clear when initializing the I2C4 adapter so we can clear
SREN bit that drives the I2C4 lines low otherwise when there
is no traffic.
