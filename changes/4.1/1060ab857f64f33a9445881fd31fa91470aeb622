perf tools: Fix cross-endian analysis

Trying to analyze a big endian data file on little endian system fails
with the error:

  0xa9b40 [0x70]: failed to process type: 9

The problem is that header parsing is not done correctly because the
file attributes are not swapped. Make it so. With this patch able to
analyze a sparc64 data file on x86_64.
