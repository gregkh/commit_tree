ARM: davinci: irqs: Correct McASP1 TX interrupt definition for DM646x

McASP1 TX interrupt is 30, not 32 on DM646x DMSoC.

While at it remove the bogus AEMIF interrupt entry from
dm646x_default_priorities[]. AEMIF interrupt on DM6467 is
60 not 30 and the entry for the correct interrupt number
is already present in the same table.
