netfilter: bridge: add helpers for fetching physin/outdev

right now we store this in the nf_bridge_info struct, accessible
via skb->nf_bridge.  This patch prepares removal of this pointer from skb:

Instead of using skb->nf_bridge->x, we use helpers to obtain the in/out
device (or ifindexes).

Followup patches to netfilter will then allow nf_bridge_info to be
obtained by a call into the br_netfilter core, rather than keeping a
pointer to it in sk_buff.
