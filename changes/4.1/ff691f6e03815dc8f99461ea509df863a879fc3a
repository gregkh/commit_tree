kernel/fork.c: new function for max_threads

PAGE_SIZE is not guaranteed to be equal to or less than 8 times the
THREAD_SIZE.

E.g.  architecture hexagon may have page size 1M and thread size 4096.
This would lead to a division by zero in the calculation of max_threads.

With this patch the buggy code is moved to a separate function
set_max_threads.  The error is not fixed.

After fixing the problem in a separate patch the new function can be
reused to adjust max_threads after adding or removing memory.

Argument mempages of function fork_init() is removed as totalram_pages is
an exported symbol.

The creation of separate patches for refactoring to a new function and for
fixing the logic was suggested by Ingo Molnar.
