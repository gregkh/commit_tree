drm/i915: Put update_state_fb() next to the fb update

update_state_fb() at the end of intel_find_plane_obj() is misleading as
it leads us to believe the update is done for all code path.

A successful call to intel_alloc_plane_obj() will return and
update_state_fb() is then only needed when we share a fb from another
CRTC. Put the update() function there then.
