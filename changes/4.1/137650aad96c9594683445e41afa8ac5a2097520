arm64: apply alternatives for !SMP kernels

Currently we only perform alternative patching for kernels built with
CONFIG_SMP, as we call apply_alternatives_all() in smp.c, which is only
built for CONFIG_SMP. Thus !SMP kernels may not have necessary
alternatives patched in.

This patch ensures that we call apply_alternatives_all() once all CPUs
are booted, even for !SMP kernels, by having the smp_init_cpus() stub
call this for !SMP kernels via up_late_init. A new wrapper,
do_post_cpus_up_work, is added so we can hook other calls here later
(e.g. boot mode logging).
