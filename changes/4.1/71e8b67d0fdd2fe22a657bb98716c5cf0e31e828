fib_trie: Update last spot w/ idx >> n->bits code and explanation

This change updates the fib_table_lookup function so that it is in sync
with the fib_find_node function in terms of the explanation for the index
check based on the bits value.

I have also updated it from doing a mask to just doing a compare as I have
found that seems to provide more options to the compiler as I have seen it
turn this into a shift of the value and test under some circumstances.

In addition I addressed one minor issue in which we kept computing the key
^ n->key when checking the fib aliases.  I pulled the xor out of the loop
in order to reduce the number of memory reads in the lookup.  As a result
we should save a couple cycles since the xor is only done once much earlier
in the lookup.
