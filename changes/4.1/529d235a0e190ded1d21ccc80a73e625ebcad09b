powerpc: Add a proper syscall for switching endianness

We currently have a "special" syscall for switching endianness. This is
syscall number 0x1ebe, which is handled explicitly in the 64-bit syscall
exception entry.

That has a few problems, firstly the syscall number is outside of the
usual range, which confuses various tools. For example strace doesn't
recognise the syscall at all.

Secondly it's handled explicitly as a special case in the syscall
exception entry, which is complicated enough without it.

As a first step toward removing the special syscall, we need to add a
regular syscall that implements the same functionality.

The logic is simple, it simply toggles the MSR_LE bit in the userspace
MSR. This is the same as the special syscall, with the caveat that the
special syscall clobbers fewer registers.

This version clobbers r9-r12, XER, CTR, and CR0-1,5-7.
