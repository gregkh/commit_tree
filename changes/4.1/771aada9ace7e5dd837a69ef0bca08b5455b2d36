s390/bpf: Adjust ALU64_DIV/MOD to match interpreter change

The s390x ALU64_DIV/MOD has been implemented according to the eBPF
interpreter specification that used do_div(). This function does a 64-bit
by 32-bit divide. It turned out that this was wrong and now the interpreter
uses div64_u64_rem() for full 64-bit division.

So fix this and use full 64-bit division in the s390x eBPF backend code.
