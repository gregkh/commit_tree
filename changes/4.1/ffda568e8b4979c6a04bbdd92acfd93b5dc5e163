ALSA: hda - Fix subsystem ID read regression

A regression was introduced in 7639a06c23c7d4cda3: if AC_PAR_SUBSYSTEM_ID
reads as zero, one should retry using AC_VERB_GET_SUBSYSTEM_ID.

This seems to hit many codecs (my own laptop included), and causes
quirks for some machines not to apply correctly.
