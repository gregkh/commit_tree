mm, hugetlb: abort __get_user_pages if current has been oom killed

If __get_user_pages() is faulting a significant number of hugetlb pages,
usually as the result of mmap(MAP_LOCKED), it can potentially allocate a
very large amount of memory.

If the process has been oom killed, this will cause a lot of memory to
potentially deplete memory reserves.

In the same way that commit 4779280d1ea4 ("mm: make get_user_pages()
interruptible") aborted for pending SIGKILLs when faulting non-hugetlb
memory, based on the premise of commit 462e00cc7151 ("oom: stop
allocating user memory if TIF_MEMDIE is set"), hugetlb page faults now
terminate when the process has been oom killed.
