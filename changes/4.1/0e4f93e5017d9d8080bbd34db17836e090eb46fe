goldfish: goldfish_tty_probe() is not using 'i' any more

The only place where 'i' has been used was a dead code that
got removed by 2a2483685a9de ("goldfish: remove unreachable line
of code"). Remove the last reference to the variable as well.

Fixes: 2a2483685a9de ("goldfish: remove unreachable line of code")
