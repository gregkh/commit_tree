arm64: remove processor_id

The global processor_id is assigned the MIDR_EL1 value of the boot
CPU in the early init code, but is never referenced afterwards.

As the relevance of the MIDR_EL1 value of the boot CPU is debatable
anyway, especially under big.LITTLE, let's remove it before anyone
starts using it.
