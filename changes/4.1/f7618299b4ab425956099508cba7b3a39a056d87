powerpc/powernv: Add pstore support on powernv

This patch extends pstore, a generic interface to platform dependent
persistent storage, support for powernv  platform to capture certain
useful information, during dying moments. Such support is already in
place for  pseries platform. This patch re-uses most of that code.

It is a common practice to compile kernels with both CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES=y
and CONFIG_PPC_POWERNV=y. The code in nvram_init_oops_partition() routine
still works as intended, as the caller is platform specific code which
passes the appropriate value for "rtas_partition_exists" parameter.
In all other places, where CONFIG_PPC_PSERIES or CONFIG_PPC_POWERNV
flag is used in this patchset, it is to reduce the kernel size in cases
where this flag is not set and doesn't have any impact logic wise.
