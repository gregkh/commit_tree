serial: 8250: Decouple RSA probe

Prepare for 8250 split; separate RSA probe and resource management
from base port operations. Override base port operations for the
config_port(), request_port() and release_port() methods to
implement the optional RSA probe and resource management only in
the universal/legacy 8250 driver.

Introduce 'probe' flags for 8250 ports, which allows drivers higher
up the driver stack to enable optional probes.
