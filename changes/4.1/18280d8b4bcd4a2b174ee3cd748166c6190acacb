KVM: s390: represent SIMD cap in kvm facility

The patch represents capability KVM_CAP_S390_VECTOR_REGISTERS by means
of the SIMD facility bit. This allows to a) disable the use of SIMD when
used in conjunction with a not-SIMD-aware QEMU, b) to enable SIMD when
used with a SIMD-aware version of QEMU and c) finally by means of a QEMU
version using the future cpu model ioctls.
