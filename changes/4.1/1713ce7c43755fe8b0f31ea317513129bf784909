ARM: 8329/1: miscellaneous vdso infrastructure, preparation

Define the layout of the data structure shared between kernel and
userspace.

Track the vdso address in the mm_context; needed for communicating
AT_SYSINFO_EHDR to the ELF loader.

Add declarations for arm_install_vdso; implementation is in a
following patch.

Define AT_SYSINFO_EHDR, and, if CONFIG_VDSO=y, report the vdso shared
object address via the ELF auxiliary vector.

Note - this adds the AT_SYSINFO_EHDR in a new user-visible header
asm/auxvec.h; this is consistent with other architectures.
