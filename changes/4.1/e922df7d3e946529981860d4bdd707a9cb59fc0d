Staging: rtl8712: Eliminate use of _init_timer

This patch introduces the use of API function setup_timer
instead of driver specific function _init_timer as it is
the preferred and standard way to setup and set the timer.
To be compatible with the change, argument types of
referenced functions are changed. Also, definition of
function _init_timer is removed as it is no longer needed
after this change.

This is done using Coccinelle and semantic patch used for
this is as follows:

@@ expression x, y; identifier a, b;@@

- _init_timer (&x, y, a, b);
+ setup_timer (&x, a, (unsigned long)b);
