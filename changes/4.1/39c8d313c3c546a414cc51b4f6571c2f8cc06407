rcu: Avoid clobbering early boot callbacks

When a CPU comes online, it initializes its callback list.  This
is a bad thing if this is the first time that the CPU has come
online and if that CPU has early boot callbacks.  This commit therefore
avoid initializing the callback list if there are callbacks present,
in which case the initial call_rcu() did the initialization for us.
