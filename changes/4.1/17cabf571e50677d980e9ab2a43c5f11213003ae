drm/i915: Trim the command parser allocations

Currently, the command parser tries to create a secondary batch exactly
as large as the original, and vmap both. This is open to abuse by
userspace using extremely large batch objects, but only executing very
short batches. For example, this would be if userspace were to implement
a command submission ringbuffer. However, we only need to allocate pages
for just the contents of the command sequence in the batch - all
relocations copied to the secondary batch will reference the original
batch and so there can be no access to the secondary batch outside of
the explicit execution region.
