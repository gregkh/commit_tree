arm64: fixmap: check idx is definitely valid

Fixmap indices are in the interval (FIX_HOLE, __end_of_fixed_addresses),
but in __set_fixmap we only check idx <= __end_of_fixed_addresses, and
therefore indices <= FIX_HOLE are erroneously accepted. If called with
such an idx, __set_fixmap may corrupt page tables outside of the fixmap
region.

This patch ensures that we validate the idx against both endpoints of
the interval.
