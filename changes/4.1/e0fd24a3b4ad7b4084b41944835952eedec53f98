x86/Kconfig: Avoid issuing pointless turned off entries to .config

Settings without prompts shouldn't normally have defaults other
than Y, as otherwise they (a) needlessly enlarge the resulting
.config and (b) if they ever get a prompt added later, the
tracked setting of off will prevent the devloper from then being
prompted for his/her choice when doing an incremental update of
the configuration (make oldconfig).
