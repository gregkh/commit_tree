i40e/i40evf: print FW build number in version string

Include the FW build number in the formatted FW version string.  In order
to fit within ethtool's 32 character limit, the etrack's unused high order
bits are trimmed as is the leading 0 for the NVM version.  This leaves
us with 2 character left for if/when the etrack id goes to 5 hex chars
and the NVM major number goes to 2 chars.
