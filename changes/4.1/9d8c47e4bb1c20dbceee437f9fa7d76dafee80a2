mm: use READ_ONCE() for non-scalar types

Commit 38c5ce936a08 ("mm/gup: Replace ACCESS_ONCE with READ_ONCE")
converted ACCESS_ONCE usage in gup_pmd_range() to READ_ONCE, since
ACCESS_ONCE doesn't work reliably on non-scalar types.

This patch also fixes the other ACCESS_ONCE usages in gup_pte_range()
and __get_user_pages_fast() in mm/gup.c
