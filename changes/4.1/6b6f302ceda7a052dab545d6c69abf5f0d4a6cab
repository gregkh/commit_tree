rhashtable: Add rhashtable_free_and_destroy()

rhashtable_destroy() variant which stops rehashes, iterates over
the table and calls a callback to release resources.

Avoids need for nft_hash to embed rhashtable internals and allows to
get rid of the being_destroyed flag. It also saves a 2nd mutex
lock upon destruction.

Also fixes an RCU lockdep splash on nft set destruction due to
calling rht_for_each_entry_safe() without holding bucket locks.
Open code this loop as we need know that no mutations may occur in
parallel.
