powerpc/eeh: Fix PE#0 check in eeh_add_to_parent_pe()

The function eeh_add_parent_pe() is used to create a PE or add one
edev to its parent PE. Current code checks if PE#0 is valid for the
later case. Actually, we should validate PE#0 for both cases when
EEH core regards PE#0 as invalid one (without flag EEH_VALID_PE_ZERO).
Otherwise, not all EEH devices can be added to its parent PE#0 for
EEH on P7IOC.

The patch fixes the issue by validating PE#0 for the two cases. So far,
we don't have PE#0 for EEH on P7IOC, but it will show up when we enable
M64 for P7IOC. The patch also makes the error message more meaningful.
