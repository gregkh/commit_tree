cc2520: Add support for CC2591 amplifier.

The TI CC2521 is an RF power amplifier that is designed to interface
with the CC2520. Conveniently, it directly interfaces with the CC2520
and does not require any pins to be connected to a
microcontroller/processor. Adding a CC2591 increases the CC2520's range,
which is useful for border router and other wall-powered applications.

Using the CC2591 with the CC2520 requires configuring the CC2520 GPIOs
that are connected to the CC2591 to correctly set the CC2591 into TX and
RX modes. Further, TI recommends that the CC2520_TXPOWER and
CC2520_AGCCTRL1 registers are set differently to maximize the CC2591's
performance. These settings are covered in TI Application Note AN065.

This patch adds an optional `amplified` field to the cc2520 entry in the
device tree. If present, the CC2520 will be configured to operate with a
CC2591.

The expected pin mapping is:
CC2520 GPIO0 --> CC2591 EN
CC2520 GPIO5 --> CC2591 PAEN
