powerpc: switch to using asm-generic for seccomp.h

Switch to using the newly created asm-generic/seccomp.h for the seccomp
strict mode syscall definitions.  The obsolete sigreturn in COMPAT mode is
retained as an override.  Remaining definitions are identical, though they
incorrectly appeared in uapi, which has been corrected.
