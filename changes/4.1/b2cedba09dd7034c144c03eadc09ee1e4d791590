ARM64: allow late use of early_ioremap

Commit 0e63ea48b4d8 (arm64/efi: add missing call to early_ioremap_reset())
added a missing call to early_ioremap_reset(). This triggers a BUG if code
tries using early_ioremap() after the early_ioremap_reset(). This is a
problem for some ACPI code which needs short-lived temporary mappings
after paging_init() but before acpi_early_init() in start_kernel(). This
patch adds definitions for the __late_set_fixmap() and __late_clear_fixmap()
which avoids the BUG by allowing later use of early_ioremap().
