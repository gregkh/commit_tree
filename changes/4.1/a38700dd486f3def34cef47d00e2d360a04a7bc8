cfg/mac80211: add regulatory classes IE during TDLS setup

Seems Broadcom TDLS peers (Nexus 5, Xperia Z3) refuse to allow TDLS
connection when channel-switching is supported but the regulatory
classes IE is missing from the setup request.
Add a chandef to reg-class translation function to cfg80211 and use it
to add the required IE during setup. For now add only the current
regulatory class as supported - it is enough to resolve the
compatibility issue.
