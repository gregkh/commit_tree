vti6: Add pmtu handling to vti6_xmit.

We currently rely on the PMTU discovery of xfrm.
However if a packet is localy sent, the PMTU mechanism
of xfrm tries to to local socket notification what
might not work for applications like ping that don't
check for this. So add pmtu handling to vti6_xmit to
report MTU changes immediately.
