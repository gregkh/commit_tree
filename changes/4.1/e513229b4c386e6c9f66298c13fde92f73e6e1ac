Drivers: hv: vmbus: prevent cpu offlining on newer hypervisors

When an SMP Hyper-V guest is running on top of 2012R2 Server and secondary
cpus are sent offline (with echo 0 > /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu$cpu/online)
the system freeze is observed. This happens due to the fact that on newer
hypervisors (Win8, WS2012R2, ...) vmbus channel handlers are distributed
across all cpus (see init_vp_index() function in drivers/hv/channel_mgmt.c)
and on cpu offlining nobody reassigns them to CPU0. Prevent cpu offlining
when vmbus is loaded until the issue is fixed host-side.

This patch also disables hibernation but it is OK as it is also broken (MCE
error is hit on resume). Suspend still works.

Tested with WS2008R2 and WS2012R2.
