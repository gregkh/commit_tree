ACPICA: Fix a couple issues with the local printf module.

ACPICA commit 6853da4c0a99b49d62d6c58d22956cd6ff5759a9

The following commit has fixed local printf issue in width.prec:

  Commit: 3589b8b8af6bdc3aafe520d76a73b77d965006b6
  Subject: ACPICA: Utilities: Fix local printf issue.

But this commit only resets width/precision/quialifier to fix the reported
issue and doesn't fix other states issues. So now we still can see breakage
in format types and integer bases.

This patch resets format type/base states for local printf to fix this
issue. Lv Zheng.

Linux kernel is not affected by this patch as acpi_ut_vsnprintf() hasn't
been enabled in the kernel.
