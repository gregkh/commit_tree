i40evf: resequence close operations

Call the netdev carrier off and TX disable functions first, before other
shutdown operations. This stops the stack from hitting us with
transmits while we're shutting down. Additionally, disable NAPI before
disabling interrupts, or the interrupt might get re-enabled
inappropriately. Finally, remove the call to netif_tx_stop_all_queues,
as it is redundant - the call to netif_tx_disable already did the same
thing.
