powerpc: Reword the "returning from prom_init" message

We get way too many bug reports that say "the kernel is hung in
prom_init", which stems from the fact that the last piece of output
people see is "returning from prom_init".

The kernel is almost never hung in prom_init(), it's just that it's
crashed somewhere after prom_init() but prior to the console coming up.

The existing message should give a clue to that, ie. "returning from"
indicates that prom_init() has finished, but it doesn't seem to work.
Let's try something different.

This prints:

  Quiescing Open Firmware ...
  Booting Linux via __start() ...

Which hopefully makes it clear that prom_init() is not the problem, and
although __start() probably isn't either, it's at least the right place
to begin looking.
