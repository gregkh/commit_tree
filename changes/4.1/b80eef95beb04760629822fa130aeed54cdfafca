gpio: pcf857x: Propagate wake-up setting to parent irq controller

The pcf857x GPIO and interrupt controller uses dummy_irq_chip, which
does not implement irq_chip.irq_set_wake() and does not set
IRQCHIP_SKIP_SET_WAKE.

This causes two s2ram issues if wake-up is enabled for the pcf857x GPIO
pins:
  1. During resume from s2ram, the following warning is printed:

     WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1046 at kernel/irq/manage.c:537 irq_set_irq_wake+0x9c/0xf8()
     Unbalanced IRQ 113 wake disable

  2. Wake-up through the pcf857x GPIO pins may fail, as the parent
     interrupt controller may be suspended.

Migrate the pcf857x GPIO and interrupt controller from dummy_irq_chip to
its own irq_chip. This irq chip implements irq_chip.irq_set_wake() to
propagate its wake-up setting to the parent interrupt controller.

This fixes wake-up through gpio-keys on sh73a0/kzm9g, where the pcf857x
interrupt is cascaded to irq-renesas-intc-irqpin, and the latter must
not be suspended when wake-up is enabled.
