net: add real socket cookies

A long standing problem in netlink socket dumps is the use
of kernel socket addresses as cookies.

1) It is a security concern.

2) Sockets can be reused quite quickly, so there is
   no guarantee a cookie is used once and identify
   a flow.

3) request sock, establish sock, and timewait socks
   for a given flow have different cookies.

Part of our effort to bring better TCP statistics requires
to switch to a different allocator.

In this patch, I chose to use a per network namespace 64bit generator,
and to use it only in the case a socket needs to be dumped to netlink.
(This might be refined later if needed)

Note that I tried to carry cookies from request sock, to establish sock,
then timewait sockets.
