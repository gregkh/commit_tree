kprobes/x86: Return correct length in __copy_instruction()

On x86-64, __copy_instruction() always returns 0 (error) if the
instruction uses %rip-relative addressing. This is because
kernel_insn_init() is called the second time for 'insn' instance
in such cases and sets all its fields to 0.

Because of this, trying to place a kprobe on such instruction
will fail, register_kprobe() will return -EINVAL.

This patch fixes the problem.
