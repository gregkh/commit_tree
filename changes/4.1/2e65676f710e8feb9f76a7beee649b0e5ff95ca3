i2c: davinci: use bus recovery infrastructure

This patch converts Davinci I2C driver to use I2C bus recovery
infrastructure, introduced by commit 5f9296ba21b3 ("i2c: Add
bus recovery infrastructure").

The i2c_bus_recovery_info is configured for Davinci I2C adapter
only in case scl_pin is provided in platform data.

As the controller must be held in reset while doing so, the
recovery routine must re-init the controller. Since this was already
being done after each call to i2c_recover_bus, move those calls into
the recovery_prepare/unprepare routines and as well.
