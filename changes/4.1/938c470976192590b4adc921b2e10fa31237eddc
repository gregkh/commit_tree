iommu: Introduce domain_alloc and domain_free iommu_ops

These new call-backs defer the allocation and destruction of
'struct iommu_domain' to the iommu driver. This allows
drivers to embed this struct into their private domain
structures and to get rid of the domain_init and
domain_destroy call-backs when all drivers have been
converted.
