ACPICA: Tables: Change acpi_find_root_pointer() to use acpi_physical_address.

ACPICA commit 7d9fd64397d7c38899d3dc497525f6e6b044e0e3

OSPMs like Linux expect an acpi_physical_address returning value from
acpi_find_root_pointer(). This triggers warnings if sizeof (acpi_size) doesn't
equal to sizeof (acpi_physical_address):
  drivers/acpi/osl.c:275:3: warning: passing argument 1 of 'acpi_find_root_pointer' from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]
  In file included from include/acpi/acpi.h:64:0,
                   from include/linux/acpi.h:36,
                   from drivers/acpi/osl.c:41:
  include/acpi/acpixf.h:433:1: note: expected 'acpi_size *' but argument is of type 'acpi_physical_address *'
This patch corrects acpi_find_root_pointer().
