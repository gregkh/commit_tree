netfilter: nf_tables: consolide set element destruction

With the conversion to set extensions, it is now possible to consolidate
the different set element destruction functions.

The set implementations' ->remove() functions are changed to only take
the element out of their internal data structures. Elements will be freed
in a batched fashion after the global transaction's completion RCU grace
period.

This reduces the amount of grace periods required for nft_hash from N
to zero additional ones, additionally this guarantees that the set
elements' extensions of all implementations can be used under RCU
protection.
