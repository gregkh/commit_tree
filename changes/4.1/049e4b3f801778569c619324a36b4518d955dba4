amba: tegra-ahb: fix register offsets in the macros

From a hardware SoC integration point of view, the offsets of the
Tegra AHB registers that are currently defined in tegra-ahb.c macros
are all off by four bytes.  Similarly, the starting address of this IP
block in our existing DT files is also off by four bytes.  Since we
attempt to make old DT files forward-compatible with newer kernels, we
cannot fix the IP block base address in old DT data.  However, we can
fix the offsets in the driver so that they are correct with respect to
the hardware, which is what this patch does.  And a subsequent patch
will allow the offset to be removed for DT 'compatible' strings used
in future DT files for newer Tegra chips that the kernel does not yet
support.
