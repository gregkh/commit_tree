lib: Fix strnlen_user() to not touch memory after specified maximum

If the specified maximum length of the string is a multiple of unsigned
long, we would load one long behind the specified maximum.  If that
happens to be in a next page, we can hit a page fault although we were
not expected to.

Fix the off-by-one bug in the test whether we are at the end of the
specified range.
