netfilter: nf_tables: add flag to indicate set contains expressions

Add a set flag to indicate that the set is used as a state table and
contains expressions for evaluation. This operation is mutually
exclusive with the mapping operation, so sets specifying both are
rejected. The lookup expression also rejects binding to state tables
since it only deals with loopup and map operations.
