net: dsa: Ensure that port array elements are initialized before being used

A network device notifier can be called for one or more of the created
slave devices before all slave devices have been registered. This can
result in a mismatch between ds->phys_port_mask and the registered devices
by the time the call is made, and it can result in a slave device being
added to a bridge before its entry in ds->ports[] has been initialized.

Rework the initialization code to initialize entries in ds->ports[] in
dsa_slave_create. With this change, dsa_slave_create no longer needs
to return slave_dev but can return an error code instead.
