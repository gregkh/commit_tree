iwlwifi: trans: Take ownership on secure machine before FW load

When we load the firmware for the 8000 B step device, it'll
verify its signature. In the current version of the
hardware, there can be a race between the WiFi firmware
being loaded and the Bluetooth firmware being loaded.

Check that WiFi is authenticated, if not, take ownership
on the authentication machine to make sure that the WiFi
firmware will be authenticated.
