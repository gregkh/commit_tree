MIPS: unaligned: Fix regular load/store instruction emulation for EVA

When emulating a regular lh/lw/lhu/sh/sw we need to use the appropriate
instruction if we are in EVA mode. This is necessary for userspace
applications which trigger alignment exceptions. In such case, the
userspace load/store instruction needs to be emulated with the correct
eva/non-eva instruction by the kernel emulator.
