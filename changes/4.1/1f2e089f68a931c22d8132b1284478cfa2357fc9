dgnc: clean up comments at start of files

Remove FSF address because it's known in the past that it has changed.
Also, remove the pointless "do not change the coding style" comments
because it's one of the reasons why it's in staging and it's quite
contradictory to what it says in TODO. Also, they contain wrong e-mails
of people which are responsible for these drivers - see TODO or
MAINTAINERS for that. We can preserve the original copyright at the top
of the most files because it shows who originally made them.
