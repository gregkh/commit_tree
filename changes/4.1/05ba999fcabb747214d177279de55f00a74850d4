HID: rmi: disable dribble packets on Synaptics touchpads

When a finger is lifted from a Synaptics touchpad the firmware will continue
to interrupts for up to a second. These additional interrupts are know and
dribble interrupts. Since the data read from the touchpad does not change
the input subsystem only reports a single event. This makes the servicing of
dribble interrupts on Linux unnecessary. This patch simply disables dribble
interupts when configuring the touchpad.
