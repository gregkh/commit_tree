Revert "libceph: clear r_req_lru_item in __unregister_linger_request()"

This reverts commit ba9d114ec5578e6e99a4dfa37ff8ae688040fd64.

.. which introduced a regression that prevented all lingering requests
requeued in kick_requests() from ever being sent to the OSDs, resulting
in a lot of missed notifies.  In retrospect it's pretty obvious that
r_req_lru_item item in the case of lingering requests can be used not
only for notarget, but also for unsent linkage due to how tightly
actual map and enqueue operations are coupled in __map_request().

The assertion that was being silenced is taken care of in the previous
("libceph: request a new osdmap if lingering request maps to no osd")
commit: by always kicking homeless lingering requests we ensure that
none of them ends up on the notarget list outside of the critical
section guarded by request_mutex.
