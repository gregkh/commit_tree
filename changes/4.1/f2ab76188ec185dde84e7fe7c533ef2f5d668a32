btrfs: Fix tail space processing in find_free_dev_extent()

It is another reason for NO_SPACE case.

When we found enough free space in loop and saved them to
max_hole_start/size before, and tail space contains pending extent,
origional innocent max_hole_start/size are reset in retry.

As a result, find_free_dev_extent() returns less space than it can,
and cause NO_SPACE in user program.
