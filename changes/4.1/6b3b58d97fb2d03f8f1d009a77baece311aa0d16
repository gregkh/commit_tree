ASoC: Intel: move the jack creation to Braswell machine driver

The jack creation code was in rt5670 codec driver before due to the
jack resources (gpio/irq) were defined under the node of codec device
in ACPI on Braswell. We used the snd_soc_jack_new() to create a jack
instance.

But now snd_soc_jack_new() is removed from upstream and we can't
use snd_soc_card_jack_new() in codec driver, so we move the jack
creation code to machine driver and pass the jack instance to codec
driver for further processing.
