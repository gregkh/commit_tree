ehea: Fix memory hook reference counting crashes

The recent commit to only register the EHEA memory hotplug hooks on
adapter probe has a few problems.

Firstly the reference counting is wrong for multiple adapters, in that
the hooks are registered multiple times. Secondly the check in the tear
down path is backward. Finally the error path doesn't decrement the
count.

The multiple registration of the hooks is the biggest problem, as it
leads to oopses when the system is rebooted, and/or errors during memory
hotplug, eg:

  $ ./mem-on-off-test.sh -r 2
  ...
