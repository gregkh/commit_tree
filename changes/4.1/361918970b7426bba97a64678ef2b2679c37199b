net/macb: fix the peripheral version test

We currently need two checks of the peripheral version in MACB_MID register.
One of them got out of sync after modification by 8a013a9c71b2 (net: macb:
Include multi queue support for xilinx ZynqMP ethernet version).
Fix this in macb_configure_caps() so that xilinx ZynqMP will be considered
as a GEM flavor.

Fixes: 8a013a9c71b2 ("net: macb: Include multi queue support for xilinx ZynqMP
ethernet version")
