target: simplify the target template registration API

Instead of calling target_fabric_configfs_init() +
target_fabric_configfs_register() / target_fabric_configfs_deregister()
target_fabric_configfs_free() from every target driver, rewrite the API
so that we have simple register/unregister functions that operate on
a const operations vector.

This patch also fixes a memory leak in several target drivers. Several
target drivers namely called target_fabric_configfs_deregister()
without calling target_fabric_configfs_free().

A large part of this patch is based on earlier changes from
Bart Van Assche <bart.vanassche@sandisk.com>.

(v2: Add a new TF_CIT_SETUP_DRV macro so that the core configfs code
can declare attributes as either core only or for drivers)
