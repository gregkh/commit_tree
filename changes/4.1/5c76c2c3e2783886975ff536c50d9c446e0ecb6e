[media] coda: call SEQ_END when the first queue is stopped

This allows to stop and restart the output queue to start a new sequence
while keeping the capture queue running. Before, sequence end would only
be issued if both output and capture queue were stopped and the sequence
start issued when reenabling the output queue would fail.
