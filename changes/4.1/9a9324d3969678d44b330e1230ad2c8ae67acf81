libata: Blacklist queued TRIM on all Samsung 800-series

The queued TRIM problems appear to be generic to Samsung's firmware and
not tied to a particular model. A recent update to the 840 EVO firmware
introduced the same issue as we saw on 850 Pro.

Blacklist queued TRIM on all 800-series drives while we work this issue
with Samsung.
