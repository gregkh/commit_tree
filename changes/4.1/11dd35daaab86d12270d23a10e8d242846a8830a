Copy set bits from another slot

bitmap_copy_from_slot reads the bitmap from the slot mentioned.
It then copies the set bits to the node local bitmap.

This is helper function for the resync operation on node failure.

bitmap_set_memory_bits() currently assumes it is only run at startup and that
they bitmap is currently empty.  So if it finds that a region is already
marked as dirty, it won't mark it dirty again. Change bitmap_set_memory_bits()
to always set the NEEDED_MASK bit if 'needed' is set.
