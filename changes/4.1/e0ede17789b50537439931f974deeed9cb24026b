iwlwifi: mvm: don't iterate interfaces to disconnect in net-detect

We shouldn't call iwl_mvm_d3_disconnect_iter() on the running
interfaces when we are woken up due to net-detect, because it doesn't
make sense.  Additionally, this seems to set the
IEEE80211_SDATA_DISCONNECT_RESUME flag that will cause a disconnection
on the next resume (if a normal WoWLAN is used).

To solve this, skip the iteration loop when net-detect is set.
