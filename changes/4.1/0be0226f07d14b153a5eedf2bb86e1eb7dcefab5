KVM: MMU: fix SMAP virtualization

KVM may turn a user page to a kernel page when kernel writes a readonly
user page if CR0.WP = 1. This shadow page entry will be reused after
SMAP is enabled so that kernel is allowed to access this user page

Fix it by setting SMAP && !CR0.WP into shadow page's role and reset mmu
once CR4.SMAP is updated
