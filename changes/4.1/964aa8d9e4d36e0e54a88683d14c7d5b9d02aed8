xfs: remove xfs_mod_incore_sb API

Now that there are no users of the bitfield based incore superblock
modification API, just remove the whole damn lot of it, including
all the bitfield definitions. This finally removes a lot of cruft
that has been around for a long time.

Credit goes to Christoph Hellwig for providing a great patch
connecting all the dots to enale us to do this. This patch is
derived from that work.
