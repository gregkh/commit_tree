ARM: dts: Add HS400 support for exynos5420 and exynos5800

HS400 timing values are added for SMDK5420, exynos5420-peach-pit
and exynos5800-peach-pi boards. This also adds RCLK GPIO line,
this gpio should be in pull-down state.
This also enables HS400 on peach-pi and this updates the clock
frequency to 800MHz to be set as input clock to controller.
