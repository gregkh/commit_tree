UBI: block: Add missing cache flushes

Block drivers are responsible for calling flush_dcache_page() on each
BIO request. This operation keeps the I$ coherent with the D$ on
architectures that don't have hardware coherency support. Without this
flush, random crashes are seen when executing user programs from an ext4
filesystem backed by a ubiblock device.

This patch is based on the change implemented in commit 2d4dc890b5c8
("block: add helpers to run flush_dcache_page() against a bio and a
request's pages").
