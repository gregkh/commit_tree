KVM: x86: Fix MSR_IA32_BNDCFGS in msrs_to_save

kvm_init_msr_list is currently called before hardware_setup. As a result,
vmx_mpx_supported always returns false when kvm_init_msr_list checks whether to
save MSR_IA32_BNDCFGS.

Move kvm_init_msr_list after vmx_hardware_setup is called to fix this issue.
