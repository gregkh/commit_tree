drm/nouveau/gem: allow user-space to specify an object should be coherent

User-space use mappable BOs notably for fences, and expects that a
value update by the GPU will be immediatly visible through the
user-space mapping.

ARM has a property that may prevent this from happening though: memory
can be mapped multiple times only if the different mappings share the
same caching properties. However all the lowmem memory is already
identity-mapped into the kernel with cache enabled, so when user-space
requests an uncached mapping, we actually get an "undefined caching
policy" one and this has strange side-effects described on Freedesktop
bug 86690.

To prevent this from happening, allow user-space to explicitly specify
which objects should be coherent, and create such objects with the
TTM_PL_FLAG_UNCACHED flag. This will make TTM allocate memory using the
DMA API, which will fix the identify mapping and allow us to safely map
the objects to user-space uncached.
