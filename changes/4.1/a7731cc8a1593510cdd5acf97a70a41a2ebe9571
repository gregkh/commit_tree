fm10k: update xcast mode before synchronizing multicast addresses

When the PF receives a request to update a multicast address for the VF,
it checks the enabled multicast mode first. Fix a bug where the VF tried
to set a multicast address before requesting the required xcast mode.
This ensures the multicast addresses are honored as long as the xcast
mode was allowed.
