sparc: Break up monolithic iommu table/lock into finer graularity pools and lock

Investigation of multithreaded iperf experiments on an ethernet
interface show the iommu->lock as the hottest lock identified by
lockstat, with something of the order of  21M contentions out of
27M acquisitions, and an average wait time of 26 us for the lock.
This is not efficient. A more scalable design is to follow the ppc
model, where the iommu_table has multiple pools, each stretching
over a segment of the map, and with a separate lock for each pool.
This model allows for better parallelization of the iommu map search.

This patch adds the iommu range alloc/free function infrastructure.
