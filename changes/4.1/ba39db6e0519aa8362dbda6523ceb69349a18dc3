selinux: convert avtab hash table to flex_array

Previously we shrank the avtab max hash buckets to avoid
high order memory allocations, but this causes avtab lookups to
degenerate to very long linear searches for the Fedora policy. Convert to
using a flex_array instead so that we can increase the buckets
without such limitations.

This change does not alter the max hash buckets; that is left to a
separate follow-on change.
