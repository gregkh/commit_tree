drm/i915: Convert intel_pipe_will_have_type() to using atomic state

Pass a crtc_state to it and find whether the pipe has an encoder of a
given type by looking at the drm_atomic_state the crtc_state points to.

Until recently i9xx_get_refclk() used to be called indirectly from
vlv_force_pll_on() with a dummy crtc_state. That dummy crtc state is not
converted to be part of a full drm atomic state, so add a WARN in case
someone decides to call that again with a such dummy state. This was
removed in
