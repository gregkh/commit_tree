printk: comment pr_cont() stating it is only to continue a line

KERN_CONT is nicely commented in kern_levels.h, but pr_cont() is now used
more often, and it lacks the comment stating what it is used for.  It can
be confused as continuing the log level, but that is not its purpose.  Its
purpose is to continue a line that had no newline enclosed.  This should
be documented by pr_cont() as well.
