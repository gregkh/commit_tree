netfilter: bridge: make BRNF_PKT_TYPE flag a bool

nf_bridge_info->mask is used for several things, for example to
remember if skb->pkt_type was set to OTHER_HOST.

For a bridge, OTHER_HOST is expected case. For ip forward its a non-starter
though -- routing expects PACKET_HOST.

Bridge netfilter thus changes OTHER_HOST to PACKET_HOST before hook
invocation and then un-does it after hook traversal.

This information is irrelevant outside of br_netfilter.

After this change, ->mask now only contains flags that need to be
known outside of br_netfilter in fast-path.

Future patch changes mask into a 2bit state field in sk_buff, so that
we can remove skb->nf_bridge pointer for good and consider all remaining
places that access nf_bridge info content a not-so fastpath.
