md: Close race when setting 'action' to 'idle'.

Checking ->sync_thread without holding the mddev_lock()
isn't really safe, even after flushing the workqueue which
ensures md_start_sync() has been run.

While this code is waiting for the lock, md_check_recovery could reap
the thread itself, and then start another thread (e.g. recovery might
finish, then reshape starts).  When this thread gets the lock
md_start_sync() hasn't run so it doesn't get reaped, but
MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING gets cleared.  This allows two threads to start
which leads to confusion.

So don't both if MD_RECOVERY_RUNNING isn't set, but if it is do
the flush and the test and the reap all under the mddev_lock to
avoid any race with md_check_recovery.
