powerpc/pci: Create pci_dn for VFs

pci_dn is the extension of PCI device node and is created from device node.
Unfortunately, VFs are enabled dynamically by PF's driver and they don't
have corresponding device nodes and pci_dn, which is required to access
VFs' config spaces.

The patch creates pci_dn for VFs in pcibios_sriov_enable() on their PF,
and removes pci_dn for VFs in pcibios_sriov_disable() on their PF. When
VF's pci_dn is created, it's put to the child list of the pci_dn of PF's
upstream bridge. The pci_dn is linked to pci_dev during early fixup time
to setup the fast path.
