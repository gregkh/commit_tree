ARM: dts: warp: Add initial WaRP Board support

The WaRP Board is a Wearable Reference Plaform. The board features:

 - Freescale i.MX6 SoloLite processor with 512MB of RAM
 - Freescale FXOS8700CQ 6-axis Xtrinsic sensor
 - Freescale Kinetis KL16 MCU
 - Freescale Xtrinsic MMA955xL intelligent motion sensing platform

The board implements a hybrid architecture to address the evolving
needs of the wearables market. The platform consists of a main board
and an example daughtercard with the ability to add additional
daughtercards for different usage models.
