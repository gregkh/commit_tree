Staging: rtl8192u: Replace printk() with pr_debug()

For dynamic debugging netdev_dbg(), dev_dbg() or  pr_debug() macro is
preferred over printk(), which is the raw way to print something.
Network system has it's own printk format, netdev_dbg, but in this case
function's argument list has no  pointer to a struct netdevice so
pr_debug is used instead.
