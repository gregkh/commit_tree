[media] s5p-mfc: set allow_zero_bytesused flag for vb2_queue_init

The s5p-mfc driver interprets a buffer with bytesused equal to 0 as a
special case indicating end-of-stream. After vb2: fix bytesused == 0
handling (8a75ffb) patch videobuf2 modified the value of bytesused if it
was 0. The allow_zero_bytesused flag was added to videobuf2 to keep
backward compatibility.
