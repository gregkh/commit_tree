ALSA: hda - Disable power_save_node for IDT92HD71bxx

We've got a regression report that 4.1-rc causes noises on a Dell
laptop.  Similar like Realtek codec, this seems also triggered by the
recent power_save_node feature.  As this kind of issue is quite hard
to debug without actual hardware, disable the power_save_node flag for
this codec as a workaround.
