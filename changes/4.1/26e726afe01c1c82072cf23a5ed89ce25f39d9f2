btrfs: incorrect handling for fiemap_fill_next_extent return

fiemap_fill_next_extent returns 0 on success, -errno on error, 1 if this was
the last extent that will fit in user array. If 1 is returned, the return
value may eventually returned to user space, which should not happen, according
to manpage of ioctl.
