kernel/reboot.c: add orderly_reboot for graceful reboot

The kernel has orderly_poweroff which allows the kernel to initiate a
graceful shutdown of userspace, by running /sbin/poweroff.  This adds
orderly_reboot that will cause userspace to shut itself down by calling
/sbin/reboot.

This will be used for shutdown initiated by a system controller on
platforms that do not use ACPI.

orderly_reboot() should be used when the system wants to allow userspace
to gracefully shut itself down.  For cases where the system may imminently
catch on fire, the existing emergency_restart() provides an immediate
reboot without involving userspace.
