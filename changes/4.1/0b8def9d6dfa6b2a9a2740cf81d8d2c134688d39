__generic_file_write_iter: keep ->ki_pos and return value consistent

A side effect worth noting: in O_APPEND case we set ->ki_pos early,
so if it turns out to be an error or a zero-length write, we'll
end up with ->ki_pos modified.  Safe, since all callers never
look at the ->ki_pos after the call of __generic_file_write_iter()
returning non-positive, all the way to caller of ->write_iter() and
those discard ->ki_pos when getting that.
