net: hip04: Make tx coalesce timer actually work

The code sets the expiry value of the timer to a relative value and
starts it with hrtimer_start_expires. That's fine, but that only works
once. The timer is started in relative mode, so the expiry value gets
overwritten with the absolut expiry time (now + expiry).

So once the timer expired, a new call to hrtimer_start_expires results
in an immidiately expired timer, because the expiry value is
already in the past.

Use the proper mechanisms to (re)start the timer in the intended way.
