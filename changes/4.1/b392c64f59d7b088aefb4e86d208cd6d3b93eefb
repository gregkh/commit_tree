checkpatch: match more world writable permissions

Currently checkpatch will fuss if one uses world writable settings in
debugfs files and DEVICE_ATTR uses by testing S_IWUGO but not testing
S_IWOTH, S_IRWXUGO or S_IALLUGO.

Extend the check to catch all cases exporting world writable permissions
including octal values.
