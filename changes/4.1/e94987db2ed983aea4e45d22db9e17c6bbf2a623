Initiate recovery on node failure

The DLM informs us in case of node failure with the DLM slot number.
cluster_info->recovery_map sets the bit corresponding to the slot number
and wakes up the recovery thread.

The recovery thread:
1. Derives the slot number from the recovery_map
2. Locks the bitmap corresponding to the slot
3. Copies the set bits to the node-local bitmap
