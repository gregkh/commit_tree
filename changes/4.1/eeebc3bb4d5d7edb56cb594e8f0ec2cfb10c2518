ARM: cpuidle: Remove duplicate header inclusion

The cpu_do_idle() function is always used by the cpuidle drivers.

That led to have each driver including cpuidle.h and proc-fns.h, they are
always paired. That makes a lot of duplicate headers inclusion. Instead of
including both in each .c file, move the proc-fns.h header inclusion in the
cpuidle.h header file directly, so we can save some line of code.
