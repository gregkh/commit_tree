checkpatch: improve operator spacing check

Code such as:
       x = timercmp(&now, &end, <);
Will currently trigger a checkpatch error. e.g.

ERROR: spaces required around that '<'

This is because the "Ignore operators passed as parameters" check looks
only for a comma following the operator.  Improve the check by also
looking for a close parenthesis.
