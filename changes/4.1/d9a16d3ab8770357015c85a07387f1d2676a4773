trace: Don't use __weak in header files

The commit that added a check for this to checkpatch says:

"Using weak declarations can have unintended link defects.  The __weak on
the declaration causes non-weak definitions to become weak."

In this case, when a PowerPC kernel is built with CONFIG_KPROBE_EVENT
but not CONFIG_UPROBE_EVENT, it generates the following warning:

WARNING: 1 bad relocations
c0000000014f2190 R_PPC64_ADDR64    uprobes_fetch_type_table

This is fixed by passing the fetch_table arrays to
traceprobe_parse_probe_arg() which also means that they can never be NULL.
