clk: clk_set_parent() with current parent shouldn't fail

If a driver calls clk_set_parent(clk, parent) and parent is the
current parent of clk we shouldn't fail in any case.
Unfortunately if clk is a read-only mux we return -ENOSYS
because we think we can't change the parent, except for in this
special case where we don't actually need to change the parent at
all. Return 0 in such a situation.
