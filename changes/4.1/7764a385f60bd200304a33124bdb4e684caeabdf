perf tools: Fix synthesizing fork_event.ppid for non-main thread

Commit ca6c41c59b9 sets the ppid based on what is read from the
/proc/pid/status file when synthesizing fork events.

This is correct thing to do for new processes but not threads of a
process.

Fix ppid for threads to be the main thread when synthesizing fork events
(ie., assume main thread spawned all sub-threads in a process).
