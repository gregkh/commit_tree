uidgid: make uid_valid and gid_valid work with !CONFIG_MULTIUSER

{u,g}id_valid call {u,g}id_eq, which calls __k{u,g}id_val on both
arguments and compares.  With !CONFIG_MULTIUSER, __k{u,g}id_val return a
constant 0, which makes {u,g}id_valid always return false.  Change
{u,g}id_valid to compare their argument against -1 instead.  That produces
identical results in the normal CONFIG_MULTIUSER=y case, but with
!CONFIG_MULTIUSER will make {u,g}id_valid constant-fold into "return
true;" rather than "return false;".

This fixes uses of devpts without CONFIG_MULTIUSER.
