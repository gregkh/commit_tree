HID: uclogic: Set quirks from inside the driver

Based on a patch from: Nikolai Kondrashov <Nikolai.Kondrashov@redhat.com>

Most of the tablets handled by hid-uclogic already use MULTI_INPUT.
For the ones which are not quirked in usbhid/hidquirks, they have a
custom report descriptor which contains only one report per HID
interface. For those tablets HID_QUIRK_MULTI_INPUT is transparent.

According to https://github.com/DIGImend/tablets, the only problematic
tablet currently handled by hid-uclogic is the TWHA60 v3. This tablet
presents different report descriptors from the ones currently quirked.
This is not a problem per se, given that this tablet is not supported
currently in this version (it needs the same command as a Huion to
start forwarding events).
