MIPS: Expand __swp_offset() to carry 40 significant bits for 64-bit kernel.

With CONFIG_MIGRATION, the PFN of the migrating pages is stored in
__swp_offset(), so we must have enough bits to store the largest
possible PFN.  OCTEON NUMA systems have 41 bits of physical address
space, so with 4K pages (12-bits), we need at least 29 bits to store
the PFN.

The current width of 24-bits is too narrow, so expand it all the way
out to 40-bits.  This leaves the low order 16 bits as zero which does
not interfere with any of the PTE bits.
