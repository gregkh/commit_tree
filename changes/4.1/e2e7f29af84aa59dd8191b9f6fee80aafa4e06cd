MIPS: c-r4k.c: Fix the 74K D-cache alias erratum workaround

Fix the 74K D-cache alias erratum workaround so that it actually works.
Our current code sets MIPS_CACHE_VTAG for the D-cache, but that flag
only has any effect for the I-cache.  Additionally MIPS_CACHE_PINDEX is
set for the D-cache if CP0.Config7.AR is also set for an affected
processor, leading to confusing information in the bootstrap log (the
flag isn't used beyond that).

So delete the setting of MIPS_CACHE_VTAG and rely on MIPS_CACHE_ALIASES,
set in a common place, removing I-cache coherency issues seen in GDB
testing with software breakpoints, gdbserver and ptrace(2), on affected
systems.

While at it add a little piece of explanation of what CP0.Config6.SYND
is so that people do not have to chase documentation.
