ARM: dts: omap3: add minimal l4 bus layout with control module support

This patch creates an l4_core interconnect for OMAP3, and moves some
of the generic peripherals under it. System control module nodes are
moved under this new interconnect also, and the SCM clock layout
is changed to use the renamed SCM node as the clock provider.
