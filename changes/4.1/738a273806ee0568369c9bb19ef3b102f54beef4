md/raid5: fix allocation of 'scribble' array.

As the new 'scribble' array is sized based on chunk size,
we need to make sure the size matches the largest of 'old'
and 'new' chunk sizes when the array is undergoing reshape.

We also potentially need to resize it even when not resizing
the stripe cache, as chunk size can change without changing
number of devices.

So move the 'resize' code into a separate function, and
consider old and new sizes when allocating.
