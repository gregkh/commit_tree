clockevents: export clockevents_unbind_device instead of clockevents_unbind

It looks like clockevents_unbind is being exported by mistake as:
- it is static;
- it is not listed in include/linux/clockchips.h;
- EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL(clockevents_unbind) follows clockevents_unbind_device()
  implementation.

I think clockevents_unbind_device should be exported instead. This is going to
be used to teardown Hyper-V clockevent devices on module unload.
