ptrace: ptrace_detach() can no longer race with SIGKILL

ptrace_detach() re-checks ->ptrace under tasklist lock and calls
release_task() if __ptrace_detach() returns true.  This was needed because
the __TASK_TRACED tracee could be killed/untraced, and it could even pass
exit_notify() before we take tasklist_lock.

But this is no longer possible after 9899d11f6544 "ptrace: ensure
arch_ptrace/ptrace_request can never race with SIGKILL".  We can turn
these checks into WARN_ON() and remove release_task().

While at it, document the setting of child->exit_code.
