tracing: Add TRACE_SYSTEM_VAR to intel-sst

New code will require TRACE_SYSTEM to be a valid C variable name,
but some tracepoints have TRACE_SYSTEM with '-' and not '_', so
it can not be used. Instead, add a TRACE_SYSTEM_VAR that can
give the tracing infrastructure a unique name for the trace system.
