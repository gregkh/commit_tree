btrfs: check io_ctl_prepare_pages return in __btrfs_write_out_cache

If io_ctl_prepare_pages fails, the pages in io_ctl.pages are not valid.
When we try to access them later, things will blow up in various ways.

Also fix the comment about the return value, which is an errno on error,
not -1, and update the cases where it was not.
