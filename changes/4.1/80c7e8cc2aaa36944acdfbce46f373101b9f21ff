vfio-pci: Allow PCI IDs to be specified as module options

This copies the same support from pci-stub for exactly the same
purpose, enabling a set of PCI IDs to be automatically added to the
driver's dynamic ID table at module load time.  The code here is
pretty simple and both vfio-pci and pci-stub are fairly unique in
being meta drivers, capable of attaching to any device, so there's no
attempt made to generalize the code into pci-core.
