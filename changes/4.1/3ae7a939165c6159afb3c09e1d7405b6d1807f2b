tick: Further simplify tick-internal.h

Move the broadcasting related section to the GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS=y
section - this also solves build failures on architectures that
don't use generic clockevents yet.

Also standardize include file style to make it easier to read, and
use nesting depth aware preprocessor directives to make future merges
easier.
