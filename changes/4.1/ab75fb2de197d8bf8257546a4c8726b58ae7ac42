staging: lustre: Convert remaining uses of "= seq_printf(...)"

The seq_printf return value, because it's frequently misused,
will eventually be converted to void.

See: commit 1f33c41c03da ("seq_file: Rename seq_overflow() to
     seq_has_overflowed() and make public")

Convert the remaining uses by hand.

Miscellanea:

o Convert fixed string output to seq_puts
