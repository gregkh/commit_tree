arm-cci: Abstract the CCI400 PMU specific definitions

CCI400 has different event specifications for PMU, for revsion
0 and revision 1. As of now, we check the revision every single
time before using the parameters for the PMU. This patch abstracts
the details of the pmu models in a struct (cci_pmu_model) and
stores the information in cci_pmu at initialisation time, avoiding
multiple probe operations.
