tracing: remove ftrace:function TRACE_EVENT_FL_USE_CALL_FILTER flag

TRACE_EVENT_FL_USE_CALL_FILTER flag in ftrace:functon event can be
removed. This flag was first introduced in commit
f306cc82a93d ("tracing: Update event filters for multibuffer").

Now, the only place uses this flag is ftrace:function, but the filter of
ftrace:function has a different code path with events/syscalls and
events/tracepoints. It uses ftrace_filter_write() and perf's
ftrace_profile_set_filter() to set the filter, the functionality of file
'tracing/events/ftrace/function/filter' is bypassed in function
init_pred(), in which case, neither call->filter nor file->filter is
used.

So we can safely remove TRACE_EVENT_FL_USE_CALL_FILTER flag from
ftrace:function events.
