Documentation/acpi/einj: Correct and streamline text

Streamline and simplify formulations, improve formatting and extend the
injection example in the error injection write up for users which we
carry in Documentation/.

Add a paragraph about checking for EINJ support and expand the ACPI5.0
memory errors section, as requested by Tony.
