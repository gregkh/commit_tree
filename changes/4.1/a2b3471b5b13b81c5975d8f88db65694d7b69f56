toshiba_acpi: Use the Hotkey Event Type function for keymap choosing

With the previous patch adding support to "Hotkey Event Type", we can
now use the type to distinguish which keymap to use.

This patch changes the toshiba_acpi_setup_keyboard function to make
use of the hotkey event type to choose the correct keymap without the
need to use the DMI matching list.
