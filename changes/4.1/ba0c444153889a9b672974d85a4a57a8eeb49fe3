Drivers: hv: hv_balloon: correctly handle val.freeram<num_pages case

'Drivers: hv: hv_balloon: refuse to balloon below the floor' fix does not
correctly handle the case when val.freeram < num_pages as val.freeram is
__kernel_ulong_t and the 'val.freeram - num_pages' value will be a huge
positive value instead of being negative.

Usually host doesn't ask us to balloon more than val.freeram but in case
he have a memory hog started after we post the last pressure report we
can get into troubles.
