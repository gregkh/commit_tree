ARM: cache-v7: shift CLIDR to extract appropriate field before masking

Rather than have code which masks and then shifts, such as:

	mrc     p15, 1, r0, c0, c0, 1
ALT_SMP(ands	r3, r0, #7 << 21)
ALT_UP( ands	r3, r0, #7 << 27)
ALT_SMP(mov	r3, r3, lsr #20)
ALT_UP(	mov	r3, r3, lsr #26)

re-arrange this as a shift and then mask.  The masking is the same for
each field which we want to extract, so this allows the mask to be
shared amongst code paths:

	mrc     p15, 1, r0, c0, c0, 1
ALT_SMP(mov	r3, r0, lsr #20)
ALT_UP(	mov	r3, r0, lsr #26)
	ands	r3, r3, #7 << 1

Use this method for the LoUIS, LoUU and LoC fields.
