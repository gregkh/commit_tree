powerpc: Fix missing L2 cache size in /sys/devices/system/cpu

This problem appears to have been introduced in 2.6.29 by commit
93197a36a9c1 "Rewrite sysfs processor cache info code".

This caused lscpu to error out on at least e500v2 devices, eg:

  error: cannot open /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cache/index2/size: No such file or directory

Some embedded powerpc systems use cache-size in DTS for the unified L2
cache size, not d-cache-size, so we need to allow for both DTS names.
Added a new CACHE_TYPE_UNIFIED_D cache_type_info structure to handle
this.
