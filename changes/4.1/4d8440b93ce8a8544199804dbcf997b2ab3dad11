gpio / ACPI: Avoid unnecessary checks in __gpiod_get_index()

If dev is NULL in __gpiod_get_index() and both ACPI and OF are
enabled, it will be checked twice before the code decides to give
up with DT/ACPI lookup, so avoid that.

Also use the observation that ACPI_COMPANION() is much more efficient
than ACPI_HANDLE(), because the latter uses the former and carries out
a check and a pointer dereference on top of it, so replace the
ACPI_HANDLE() check with an ACPI_COMPANION() one which does not
require the additional IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_ACPI) check too.
