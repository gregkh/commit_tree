leds/led-class: Handle LEDs with the same name

The current code expected that every LED had an unique name. This is a
legit expectation when the device tree can no be modified or extended.
But with device tree overlays this requirement can be easily broken.

This patch finds out if the name is already in use and adds the suffix
_1, _2... if not.
