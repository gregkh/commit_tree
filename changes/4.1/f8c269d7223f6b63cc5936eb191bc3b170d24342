btrfs: cleanup 64bit/32bit divs, compile time constants

Switch to div_u64 if the divisor is a numeric constant or sum of
sizeof()s. We can remove a few instances of do_div that has the hidden
semtantics of changing the 1st argument.

Small power-of-two divisors are converted to bitshifts, large values are
kept intact for clarity.
