KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Minor cleanups

* Remove unused kvmppc_vcore::n_busy field.
* Remove setting of RMOR, since it was only used on PPC970 and the
  PPC970 KVM support has been removed.
* Don't use r1 or r2 in setting the runlatch since they are
  conventionally reserved for other things; use r0 instead.
* Streamline the code a little and remove the ext_interrupt_to_host
  label.
* Add some comments about register usage.
* hcall_try_real_mode doesn't need to be global, and can't be
  called from C code anyway.
