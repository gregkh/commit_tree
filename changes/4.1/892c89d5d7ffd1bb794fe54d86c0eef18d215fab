staging: gdm724x: Correction of variable usage after applying ALIGN()

Fix regression introduced by commit <29ef8a53542a>. After it writing
AT commands to /dev/GCT-ATM0 is unsuccessful (no echo, no response)
and dmesg show "gdmtty: invalid payload : 1 16 f011".

Before that commit value of dummy_cnt was only a padding size. After using
ALIGN() this value is increased by its first argument. So the following
usage of this variable needs correction.
