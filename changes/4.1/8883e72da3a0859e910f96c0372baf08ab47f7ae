ARM: shmobile: R-Car Gen2: CONFIG_COMMON_CLK is always set

Since commit e042681894b62d60 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7790: Remove legacy
code"), all R-Car Gen2 SoCs are supported by multiplatform kernels only.
As CONFIG_COMMON_CLK is always set for multiplatform kernels, we can
remove related #ifdefs in code specific to R-Car Gen2 SoCs.
