target: Drop signal_pending checks after interruptible lock acquire

Once upon a time, iscsit_get_tpg() was using an un-interruptible
lock.  The signal_pending() usage was a check to allow userspace
to break out of the operation with SIGINT.

AFAICT, there's no reason why this is necessary anymore, and as
reported by Alexey can be potentially dangerous.  Also, go ahead
and drop the other two problematic cases within iscsit_access_np()
and sbc_compare_and_write() as well.
