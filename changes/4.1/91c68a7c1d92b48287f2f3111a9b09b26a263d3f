Input: sun4i-ts -  A10 (sun4i) has a different temperature curve

Testing has revealed that the temperature in the rtp controller of the A10
(sun4i) SoC has a different curve then on the A13 (sun5i) and later models.

Add a new sun5i-a13-ts compatible to differentiate the newer models and
set the curve based on the compatible string.

The new curve is still not ideal on all A10-s, that seems to have to
do with there being a large spread between different A10-s out there,
the new curve us based on callibration results on 4 completely different
models:
                        raw min raw max temp min temp max stepsize offset
Tong Zhang's hackberry    2402    2680    45.0     80.0    0.125   -255.3
Hansg's Cubieboard        2207    2300    36.0     45.0    0.096   -175.8
Olliver's lime 1 (*):     2258    2537    48.3     87.1    0.139   -265.7
Olliver's lime 2 (*):     2222    2486    46.7     91.7    0.170   -331.0
*) from: http://linux-sunxi.org/Temperature_Calibration

Average all 4:                                             0.133   -257.0
Average without outliers (middle 2):                       0.132   -261.0

Since it is better to slightly overreport the temperature this patch uses
the average of all 4 as curve.

This fixes the temperature reported on the A10 being much higher then
expected.
