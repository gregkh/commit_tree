irqchip: armada-370-xp: Introduce a is_percpu_irq() helper for readability

This commit introduces a helper function is_percpu_irq(), to be used
when interrupts are mapped to decide which ones are set as per CPU.

This change will allow to extend the list of per cpu interrupts in a less
intrusive fashion; also, it makes the code slightly more readable by keeping
a list of the per CPU interrupts.
