iio: bmc150: introduce bmc150_accel_interrupt

Since both triggers and events can share an interrupt, add a data
structure that tracks the users of an interrupt so that it enables or
disables it only for the first users and respectively last user.

This will allows us to easily add more events or triggers.

The patch also adds an interrupt enabled counter, so that we can
easily know if we need to put the device in normal mode when the
resume callback is issued.
