tty/n_gsm.c: fix a memory leak when gsmtty is removed

when gsmtty_remove put dlci, it will cause memory leak if dlci->port's refcount is zero.
So we do the cleanup work in .cleanup callback instead.

dlci will be last put in two call chains.
1) gsmld_close -> gsm_cleanup_mux -> gsm_dlci_release -> dlci_put
2) gsmld_remove -> dlci_put
so there is a race. the memory leak depends on the race.

In call chain 2. we hit the memory leak. below comment tells.

release_tty -> tty_driver_remove_tty -> gsmtty_remove -> dlci_put -> tty_port_destructor (WARN_ON(port->itty) and return directly)
                         |
                tty->port->itty = NULL;
                         |
                tty_kref_put ---> release_one_tty -> gsmtty_cleanup (added by our patch)

So our patch fix the memory leak by doing the cleanup work after tty core did.
