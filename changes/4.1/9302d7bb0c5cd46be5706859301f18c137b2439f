sctp: Fix mangled IPv4 addresses on a IPv6 listening socket

sctp_v4_map_v6 was subtly writing and reading from members
of a union in a way the clobbered data it needed to read before
it read it.

Zeroing the v6 flowinfo overwrites the v4 sin_addr with 0, meaning
that every place that calls sctp_v4_map_v6 gets ::ffff:0.0.0.0 as the
result.

Reorder things to guarantee correct behaviour no matter what the
union layout is.

This impacts user space clients that open an IPv6 SCTP socket and
receive IPv4 connections. Prior to 299ee user space would see a
sockaddr with AF_INET and a correct address, after 299ee the sockaddr
is AF_INET6, but the address is wrong.
