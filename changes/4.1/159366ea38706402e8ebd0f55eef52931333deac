ASoC: wm8996: ensure lower bounds of 1 for timeout

wait_for_completion_timeout can be called with timeout == 0 due to
msecs_to_jiffies(2) == 1 for HZ < 1000 and usecs_to_jiffies(300) == 1
for all reasonable values of HZ, thus the following timeout /= 2; sets
timeout to 0. This patch simply adds a lower-bounds of 1.
