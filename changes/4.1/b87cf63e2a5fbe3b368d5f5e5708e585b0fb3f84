x86/asm/entry: Add comments about various syscall instructions

SYSCALL/SYSRET and SYSENTER/SYSEXIT have weird semantics.
Moreover, they differ in 32- and 64-bit mode.

What is saved? What is not? Is rsp set? Are interrupts disabled?
People tend to not remember these details well enough.

This patch adds comments which explain in detail
what registers are modified by each of these instructions.

The comments are placed immediately before corresponding
entry and exit points.
