ia64: expose number of page table levels on Kconfig level

We would want to use number of page table level to define mm_struct.
Let's expose it as CONFIG_PGTABLE_LEVELS.

We need to define PGTABLE_LEVELS before sourcing init/Kconfig:
arch/Kconfig will define default value and it's sourced from init/Kconfig.
