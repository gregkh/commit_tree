netfilter: bridge: use rcu hook to resolve br_netfilter dependency

e5de75b ("netfilter: bridge: move DNAT helper to br_netfilter") results
in the following link problem:

net/bridge/br_device.c:29: undefined reference to `br_nf_prerouting_finish_bridge`

Moreover it creates a hard dependency between br_netfilter and the
bridge core, which is what we've been trying to avoid so far.

Resolve this problem by using a hook structure so we reduce #ifdef
pollution and keep bridge netfilter specific code under br_netfilter.c
which was the original intention.
