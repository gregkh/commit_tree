ARM64 / ACPI: Get PSCI flags in FADT for PSCI init

There are two flags: PSCI_COMPLIANT and PSCI_USE_HVC. When set,
the former signals to the OS that the firmware is PSCI compliant.
The latter selects the appropriate conduit for PSCI calls by
toggling between Hypervisor Calls (HVC) and Secure Monitor Calls
(SMC).

FADT table contains such information in ACPI 5.1, FADT table was
parsed in ACPI table init and copy to struct acpi_gbl_FADT, so
use the flags in struct acpi_gbl_FADT for PSCI init.

Since ACPI 5.1 doesn't support self defined PSCI function IDs,
which means that only PSCI 0.2+ is supported in ACPI.
