rcu: Remove redundant check of cpu_online()

Because invoke_cpu_core() checks whether the current CPU is online,
there is no need for __call_rcu_core() to redundantly check it.
There should not be any performance degradation because the called
function is visible to the compiler.  This commit therefore removes
the redundant check.
