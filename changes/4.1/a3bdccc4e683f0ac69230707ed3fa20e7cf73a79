Btrfs: prevent list corruption during free space cache processing

__btrfs_write_out_cache is holding the ctl->tree_lock while it prepares
a list of bitmaps to record in the free space cache.  It was dropping
the lock while it worked on other components, which made a window for
free_bitmap() to free the bitmap struct without removing it from the
list.

This changes things to hold the lock the whole time, and also makes sure
we hold the lock during enospc cleanup.
