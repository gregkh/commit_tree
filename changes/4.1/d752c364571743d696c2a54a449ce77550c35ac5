ipvs: allow rescheduling of new connections when port reuse is detected

Currently, when TCP/SCTP port reusing happens, IPVS will find the old
entry and use it for the new one, behaving like a forced persistence.
But if you consider a cluster with a heavy load of small connections,
such reuse will happen often and may lead to a not optimal load
balancing and might prevent a new node from getting a fair load.

This patch introduces a new sysctl, conn_reuse_mode, that allows
controlling how to proceed when port reuse is detected. The default
value will allow rescheduling of new connections only if the old entry
was in TIME_WAIT state for TCP or CLOSED for SCTP.
