drm/i915/skl: Support secondary (rotated) frame buffer mapping

90/270 rotated scanout needs a rotated GTT view of the framebuffer.

This is put in a separate VMA with a dedicated ggtt view and wired such that
it is created when a framebuffer is pinned to a 90/270 rotated plane.

Rotation is only possible with Yb/Yf buffers and error is propagated to
user space in case of a mismatch.

Special rotated page view is constructed at the VMA creation time by
borrowing the DMA addresses from obj->pages.

v2:
    * Do not bother with pages for rotated sg list, just populate the DMA
      addresses. (Daniel Vetter)
    * Checkpatch cleanup.

v3:
    * Rebased on top of new plane handling (create rotated mapping when
      setting the rotation property).
    * Unpin rotated VMA on unpinning from display plane.
    * Simplify rotation check using bitwise AND. (Chris Wilson)

v4:
    * Fix unpinning of optional rotated mapping so it is really considered
      to be optional.

v5:
   * Rebased for fb modifier changes.
   * Rebased for atomic commit.
   * Only pin needed view for display. (Ville Syrjälä, Daniel Vetter)

v6:
   * Rebased after preparatory work has been extracted out. (Daniel Vetter)

v7:
   * Slightly simplified tiling geometry calculation.
   * Moved rotated GGTT view implementation into i915_gem_gtt.c (Daniel Vetter)

v8:
   * Do not use i915_gem_obj_size to get object size since that actually
     returns the size of an VMA which may not exist.
   * Rebased for ggtt view changes.

v9:
   * Rebased after code review changes on the preceding patches.
   * Tidy function definitions. (Joonas Lahtinen)
