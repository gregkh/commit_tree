documentation: Clarify memory-barrier semantics of atomic operations

All value-returning atomic read-modify-write operations must provide full
memory-barrier semantics on both sides of the operation.  This commit
clarifies the documentation to make it clear that these memory-barrier
semantics are provided by the operations themselves, not by their callers.
