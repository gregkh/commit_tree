Btrfs: fix use after free when close_ctree frees the orphan_rsv

Near the end of close_ctree, we're calling btrfs_free_block_rsv
to free up the orphan rsv.  The problem is this call updates the
space_info, which has already been freed.

This adds a new __ function that directly calls kfree instead of trying
to update the space infos.
