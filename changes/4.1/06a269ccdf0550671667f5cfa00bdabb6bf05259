ocfs2: less function calls in ocfs2_figure_merge_contig_type() after error detection

ocfs2_free_path() was called in some cases by
ocfs2_figure_merge_contig_type() during error handling even if the passed
variables "left_path" and "right_path" contained still a null pointer.

Corresponding implementation details could be improved by adjustments for
jump labels according to the current Linux coding style convention.
