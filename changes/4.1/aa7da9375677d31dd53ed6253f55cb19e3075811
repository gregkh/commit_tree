mpls: Correct the ttl decrement.

According to RFC3032 section 2.4.2  packets with an outgoing
ttl of 0 MUST NOT be forwarded.  According to section 2.4.1
an outgoing TTL of 0 comes from an incomming TTL <= 1.

Therefore any packets that is received with a ttl <= 1 should
not have it's ttl decremented and forwarded.
