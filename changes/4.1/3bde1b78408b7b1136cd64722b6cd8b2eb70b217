[media] dvbdev: represent frontend with two pads

While on some devices the tuner is bound inside the frontend,
other devices use a separate subdevice for it.

So, in order to be more generic, better to map it with two
pads.

That will allows to use the media controller to lock the tuner
between the DVB and the V4L2 sub-drivers, on hybrid devices.

While here, change the logic to use pad 0 as sink for devices
with both sink and source pads.
