mm: soft-offline: fix num_poisoned_pages counting on concurrent events

If multiple soft offline events hit one free page/hugepage concurrently,
soft_offline_page() can handle the free page/hugepage multiple times,
which makes num_poisoned_pages counter increased more than once.  This
patch fixes this wrong counting by checking TestSetPageHWPoison for normal
papes and by checking the return value of dequeue_hwpoisoned_huge_page()
for hugepages.
