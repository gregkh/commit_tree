mnt: Factor out unhash_mnt from detach_mnt and umount_tree

Create a function unhash_mnt that contains the common code between
detach_mnt and umount_tree, and use unhash_mnt in place of the common
code.  This add a unncessary list_del_init(mnt->mnt_child) into
umount_tree but given that mnt_child is already empty this extra
line is a noop.
