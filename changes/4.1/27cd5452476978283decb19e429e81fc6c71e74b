filter: introduce SKF_AD_VLAN_TPID BPF extension

If vlan offloading takes place then vlan header is removed from frame
and its contents, both vlan_tci and vlan_proto, is available to user
space via TPACKET interface. However, only vlan_tci can be used in BPF
filters.

This commit introduces a new BPF extension. It makes possible to load
the value of vlan_proto (vlan TPID) to register A. Support for classic
BPF and eBPF is being added, analogous to skb->protocol.
