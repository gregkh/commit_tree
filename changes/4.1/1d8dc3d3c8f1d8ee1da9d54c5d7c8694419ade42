rhashtable: don't attempt to grow when at max_size

The conversion of mac80211's station table to rhashtable had a bug
that I found by accident in code review, that hadn't been found as
rhashtable apparently managed to have a maximum hash chain length
of one (!) in all our testing.

In order to test the bug and verify the fix I set my rhashtable's
max_size very low (4) in order to force getting hash collisions.

At that point, rhashtable WARNed in rhashtable_insert_rehash() but
didn't actually reject the hash table insertion. This caused it to
lose insertions - my master list of stations would have 9 entries,
but the rhashtable only had 5. This may warrant a deeper look, but
that WARN_ON() just shouldn't happen.

Fix this by not returning true from rht_grow_above_100() when the
rhashtable's max_size has been reached - in this case the user is
explicitly configuring it to be at most that big, so even if it's
now above 100% it shouldn't attempt to resize.

This fixes the "lost insertion" issue and consequently allows my
code to display its error (and verify my fix for it.)
