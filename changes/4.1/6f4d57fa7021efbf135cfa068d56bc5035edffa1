arm64: remove __calc_phys_offset

This removes the function __calc_phys_offset and all open coded
virtual to physical address translations using the offset kept
in x28.

Instead, just use absolute or PC-relative symbol references as
appropriate when referring to virtual or physical addresses,
respectively.
