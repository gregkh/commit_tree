serial: 8250: Separate 8250 console interface

Prepare for 8250 core split; separate shared console interface from the
console definition of the universal driver.

Introduce 8250 shared console interface; serial8250_console_write() and
serial8250_console_setup() which decouples the console operation from
the port structure storage.

Rename existing serial8250_console* identifiers to univ8250_console*.
