rocker: rename lport to pport

This is just a rename of physical ports from "lport" to "pport".  Not a
functional change.  OF-DPA uses logical ports (lport) for tunnels, but the
driver (and device) were using "lport" for physical ports.  Renaming physical
ports references to "pport", freeing up "lport" for use later with tunnels.
