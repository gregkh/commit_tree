drm/i915: Disable DDR DVFS on CHV

DDR DVFS introduces massive memory latencies which can't be handled by
the PND deadline stuff. Instead the watermarks will need to be
programmed to compensate for the latency and the deadlines will need to
be programmed to tight fixed values. That means DDR DVFS can only be
enabled if the display FIFOs are large enough, and that pretty much
means we have to manually repartition them to suit the needs of the
moment.

That's a lot of change, so in the meantime let's just disable DDR DVFS
to get the display(s) to be stable.
