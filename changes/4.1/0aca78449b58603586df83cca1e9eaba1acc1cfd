staging: unisys: remove ERRDEV macros

Remove the LOGERR, LOGERRDEV, LOGERRDEVX, LOGERRNAME, LOGORDUMPERR
macros from all the drivers.

In one case the removal of the ERRDRV() changed things such that a macro which
returned a value was needed, but the return value was no longer being used. In
this case the macro was replaced with the contents of the macro, but with the
truth calculation removed so that it would not generate a warning.
