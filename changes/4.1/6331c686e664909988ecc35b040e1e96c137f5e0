Bluetooth: btusb: Consolidate Broadcom based device entries

For all modern Bluetooth USB devices from Broadcom it makes a lot more
sense to use USB_VENDOR_AND_INTERFACE_INFO instead of manually adding
USB_DEVICE for each one of them. There are already interface entries
for these vendors and so just remove the duplicate device entries.
