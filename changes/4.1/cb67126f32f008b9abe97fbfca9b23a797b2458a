HID: hid-sensor-hub: Add support for application collection

Section 4.2.5 of HID Sensor hub specification allows two methods
defining sensor devices.
- Each sensor device by its own collection
- A top level application collection object, including multiple
sensors.
In the first method, each sensor can be in its own sensor application
collection without a physical collection.
In the second method there is a usage id for collection type, which
is defined as an application collection, with multiple physical
collections in it. It is possible to define fusion sensor with this
and may have its own handler. If there is a callback registered
for the collection type, then forward all reports for sensors in
its collection to this handler.
