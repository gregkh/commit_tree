x86/signal: Remove pax argument from restore_sigcontext

The 'pax' argument is unnecesary.  Instead, store the RAX value
directly in regs.

This pattern goes all the way back to 2.1.106pre1, when restore_sigcontext()
was changed to return an error code instead of EAX directly:

  https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/history/history.git/diff/arch/i386/kernel/signal.c?id=9a8f8b7ca3f319bd668298d447bdf32730e51174

In 2007 sigaltstack syscall support was added, where the return
value of restore_sigcontext() was changed to carry the memory-copying
failure code.

But instead of putting 'ax' into regs->ax directly, it was carried
in via a pointer and then returned, where the generic syscall return
code copied it to regs->ax.

So there was never any deeper reason for this suboptimal pattern, it
was simply never noticed after being introduced.
