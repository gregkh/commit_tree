perf bench futex: Fix hung wakeup tasks after requeueing

The futex-requeue benchmark can hang because of missing wakeups once the
benchmark is done, ie:

[Run 1]: Requeued 1024 of 1024 threads in 0.3290 ms
perf: couldn't wakeup all tasks (135/1024)

This bug, while perhaps suggesting missing wakeups in kernel futex code,
is merely a consequence of the crappy FUTEX_CMP_REQUEUE man page,
incorrectly mentioning that the number of requeued tasks is in fact
returned, not the wakeups.

This patch acknowledges this and updates the corresponding futex_wake
code around it.
