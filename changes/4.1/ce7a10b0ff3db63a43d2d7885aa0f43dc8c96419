amba: tegra-ahb: detect and correct bogus base address

From a hardware SoC integration point of view, the starting address of
this IP block in the existing Tegra SoC DT files is off by 4 bytes
from the actual base address.  Since we attempt to make old DT files
forward-compatible with newer kernels, we cannot fix the IP block base
address in old DT data. This patch works around the problem by
detecting the four byte base address offset in the driver code, and
correcting it if it's detected.  (In general, IP block base addresses
almost always have a null low byte.)

Future SoC DT data for Tegra AHB should use the correct Tegra AHB base
address, in cases where there is no DT data backward compatibility
requirement.

This patch is a revision of the patch originally titled
"amba: tegra-ahb: use correct base address for future chip support".
