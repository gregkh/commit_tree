mm: refactor do_wp_page - rewrite the unlock flow

When do_wp_page is ending, in several cases it needs to unlock the pages
and ptls it was accessing.

Currently, this logic was "called" by using a goto jump.  This makes
following the control flow of the function harder.  Readability was
further hampered by the unlock case containing large amount of logic
needed only in one of the 3 cases.

Using goto for cleanup is generally allowed.  However, moving the
trivial unlocking flows to the relevant call sites allow deeper
refactoring in the next patch.
