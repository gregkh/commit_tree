Bluetooth: Add support for Local OOB Extended Data Update events

When a different user requests a new set of local out-of-band data, then
inform all previous users that the data has been updated. To limit the
scope of users, the updates are limited to previous users. If a user has
never requested out-of-band data, it will also not see the update.
