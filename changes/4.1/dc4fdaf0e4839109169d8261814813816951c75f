PCI / ACPI: Do not set ACPI companions for host bridges with parents

Commit 97badf873ab6 (device property: Make it possible to use
secondary firmware nodes) uncovered a bug in the x86 (and ia64) PCI
host bridge initialization code that assumes bridge->bus->sysdata
to always point to a struct pci_sysdata object which need not be
the case (in particular, the Xen PCI frontend driver sets it to point
to a different data type).  If it is not the case, an incorrect
pointer (or a piece of data that is not a pointer at all) will be
passed to ACPI_COMPANION_SET() and that may cause interesting
breakage to happen going forward.

To work around this problem use the observation that the ACPI
host bridge initialization always passes NULL as parent to
pci_create_root_bus(), so if pcibios_root_bridge_prepare() sees
a non-NULL parent of the bridge, it should not attempt to set
an ACPI companion for it, because that means that
pci_create_root_bus() has been called by someone else.
