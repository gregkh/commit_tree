drivers: of/base: move of_init to driver_init

Commit 5590f3196b29 ("drivers/core/of: Add symlink to device-tree from
devices with an OF node") adds the symlink `of_node` for each device
pointing to it's device tree node while creating/initialising it.

However the devicetree sysfs is created and setup in of_init which is
executed at core_initcall level. For all the devices created before
of_init, the following error is thrown:
	"Error -2(-ENOENT) creating of_node link"

Like many other components in driver model, initialize the sysfs support
for OF/devicetree from driver_init so that it's ready before any devices
are created.

	devices with an OF node")
