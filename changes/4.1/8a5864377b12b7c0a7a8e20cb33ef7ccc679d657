drm/i915/skl: Restructured the gen6_set_rps_thresholds function

Prior to SKL, the time period programmed in Up/Down EI & Up/Down
threshold registers was in units of 1.28 micro seconds. But for
SKL, the units have changed (1.333 micro seconds).
Have generalized the implementation of gen6_set_rps_thresholds function,
by removing the hard coding done in it as per 1.28 micro seconds.

v2: Renamed the local variables & removed superfluous comments (Chris)
