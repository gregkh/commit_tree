[media] lgdt3306a: don't go past the buffer

As warned by smatch:
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/lgdt3306a.c:1354 log10_x1000() error: buffer overflow 'valx_x10' 14 <= 14
	drivers/media/dvb-frontends/lgdt3306a.c:1355 log10_x1000() error: buffer overflow 'log10x_x1000' 14 <= 14

There's a potential of returning a value out of the buffer. Fix it.

While here, remove the ugly braced block.
