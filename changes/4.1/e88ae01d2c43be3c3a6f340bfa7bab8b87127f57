PCI: Print PF SR-IOV resource that contains all VF(n) BAR space

When we size VF BAR0, VF BAR1, etc., from the SR-IOV Capability of a PF, we
learn the alignment requirement and amount of space consumed by a single
VF.  But when VFs are enabled, *each* of the NumVFs consumes that amount of
space, so the total size of the PF resource is "VF BAR size * NumVFs".

Add a printk of the total space consumed by the VFs corresponding to what
we already do for normal non-IOV BARs.

No functional change; new message only.
