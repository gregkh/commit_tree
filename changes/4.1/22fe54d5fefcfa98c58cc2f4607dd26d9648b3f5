netfilter: nf_tables: add support for dynamic set updates

Add a new "dynset" expression for dynamic set updates.

A new set op ->update() is added which, for non existant elements,
invokes an initialization callback and inserts the new element.
For both new or existing elements the extenstion pointer is returned
to the caller to optionally perform timer updates or other actions.

Element removal is not supported so far, however that seems to be a
rather exotic need and can be added later on.
