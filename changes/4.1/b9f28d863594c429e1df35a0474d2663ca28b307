sd, mmc, virtio_blk, string_helpers: fix block size units

The current string_get_size() overflows when the device size goes over
2^64 bytes because the string helper routine computes the suffix from
the size in bytes.  However, the entirety of Linux thinks in terms of
blocks, not bytes, so this will artificially induce an overflow on very
large devices.  Fix this by making the function string_get_size() take
blocks and the block size instead of bytes.  This should allow us to
keep working until the current SCSI standard overflows.

Also fix virtio_blk and mmc (both of which were also artificially
multiplying by the block size to pass a byte side to string_get_size()).

The mathematics of this is pretty simple:  we're taking a product of
size in blocks (S) and block size (B) and trying to re-express this in
exponential form: S*B = R*N^E (where N, the exponent is either 1000 or
1024) and R < N.  Mathematically, S = RS*N^ES and B=RB*N^EB, so if RS*RB
< N it's easy to see that S*B = RS*RB*N^(ES+EB).  However, if RS*BS > N,
we can see that this can be re-expressed as RS*BS = R*N (where R =
RS*BS/N < N) so the whole exponent becomes R*N^(ES+EB+1)
