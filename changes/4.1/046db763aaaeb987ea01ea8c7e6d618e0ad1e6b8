regulator: core: Add devres versions of notifier registration

Add devm_regulator_register_notifier, this adds the resource against the
device for the consumer supply we are registering the notifier for. There
seem to be few use-cases where this wouldn't be the users intention and
this ensures the notifiers will always be removed at the correct time.
