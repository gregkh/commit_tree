rcu: Provide diagnostic option to slow down grace-period initialization

Grace-period initialization normally proceeds quite quickly, so
that it is very difficult to reproduce races against grace-period
initialization.  This commit therefore allows grace-period
initialization to be artificially slowed down, increasing
race-reproduction probability.  A pair of new Kconfig parameters are
provided, CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_INIT to enable the slowdowns, and
CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_INIT_DELAY to specify the number of jiffies
of slowdown to apply.  A boot-time parameter named rcutree.gp_init_delay
allows boot-time delay to be specified.  By default, no delay will be
applied even if CONFIG_RCU_TORTURE_TEST_SLOW_INIT is set.
