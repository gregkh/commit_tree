Btrfs: fill ->last_trans for delayed inode in btrfs_fill_inode.

We need to fill inode when we found a node for it in delayed_nodes_tree.
But we did not fill the ->last_trans currently, it will cause the test
of xfstest/generic/311 fail. Scenario of the 311 is shown as below:

Problem:
	(1). test_fd = open(fname, O_RDWR|O_DIRECT)
	(2). pwrite(test_fd, buf, 4096, 0)
	(3). close(test_fd)
	(4). drop_all_caches()	<-------- "echo 3 > /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches"
	(5). test_fd = open(fname, O_RDWR|O_DIRECT)
	(6). fsync(test_fd);
				<-------- we did not get the correct log entry for the file
Reason:
	When we re-open this file in (5), we would find a node
in delayed_nodes_tree and fill the inode we are lookup with the
information. But the ->last_trans is not filled, then the fsync()
will check the ->last_trans and found it's 0 then say this inode
is already in our tree which is commited, not recording the extents
for it.

Fix:
	This patch fill the ->last_trans properly and set the
runtime_flags if needed in this situation. Then we can get the
log entries we expected after (6) and generic/311 passed.
