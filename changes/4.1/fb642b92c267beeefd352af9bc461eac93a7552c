md/raid5: duplicate some more handle_stripe_clean_event code in break_stripe_batch_list

break_stripe_batch list didn't clear head_sh->batch_head.
This was probably a bug.

Also clear all R5_Overlap flags and if any were cleared, wake up
'wait_for_overlap'.
This isn't always necessary but the worst effect is a little
extra checking for code that is waiting on wait_for_overlap.

Also, don't use wake_up_nr() because that does the wrong thing
if 'nr' is zero, and it number of flags cleared doesn't
strongly correlate with the number of threads to wake.
