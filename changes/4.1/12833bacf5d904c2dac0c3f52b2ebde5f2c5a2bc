ARM: 8325/1: exynos: move resume code to .text section

This code calls cpu_resume() using a straight branch (b), so
now that we have moved cpu_resume() back to .text, this should
be moved there as well. Any direct references to symbols that will
remain in the .data section are replaced with explicit PC-relative
references.
