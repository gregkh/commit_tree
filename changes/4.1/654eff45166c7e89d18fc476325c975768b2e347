fib_trie: Only display main table in /proc/net/route

When we merged the tries for local and main I had overlooked the iterator
for /proc/net/route.  As a result it was outputting both local and main
when the two tries were merged.

This patch resolves that by only providing output for aliases that are
actually in the main trie.  As a result we should go back to the original
behavior which I assume will be necessary to maintain legacy support.
