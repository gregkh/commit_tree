perf: Add API for PMUs to write to the AUX area

For pmus that wish to write data to ring buffer's AUX area, provide
perf_aux_output_{begin,end}() calls to initiate/commit data writes,
similarly to perf_output_{begin,end}. These also use the same output
handle structure. Also, similarly to software counterparts, these
will direct inherited events' output to parents' ring buffers.

After the perf_aux_output_begin() returns successfully, handle->size
is set to the maximum amount of data that can be written wrt aux_tail
pointer, so that no data that the user hasn't seen will be overwritten,
therefore this should always be called before hardware writing is
enabled. On success, this will return the pointer to pmu driver's
private structure allocated for this aux area by pmu::setup_aux. Same
pointer can also be retrieved using perf_get_aux() while hardware
writing is enabled.

PMU driver should pass the actual amount of data written as a parameter
to perf_aux_output_end(). All hardware writes should be completed and
visible before this one is called.

Additionally, perf_aux_output_skip() will adjust output handle and
aux_head in case some part of the buffer has to be skipped over to
maintain hardware's alignment constraints.

Nested writers are forbidden and guards are in place to catch such
attempts.
