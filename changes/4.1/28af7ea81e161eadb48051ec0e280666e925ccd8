Staging: rtl8188eu: Eliminate use of _init_timer

This patch introduces the use of API function setup_timer
instead of driver specific function init_timer as it is
the preferred and standard way to set and setup the timer.
To be compatible with the changes, argument types of
referenced functions are changed. Also, definition of
function _init_timer is removed as it is no longer needed
after this change.

Here, these cases are handled using Coccinelle and
semantic patch used for this is as follows:

@@ expression x, y; identifier a, b;@@

- _init_timer (&x, y, a, b);
+ setup_timer (&x, a, (unsigned long)b);
