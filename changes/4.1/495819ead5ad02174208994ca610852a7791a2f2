zsmalloc: micro-optimize zs_object_copy()

A micro-optimization.  Avoid additional branching and reduce (a bit)
registry pressure (f.e.  s_off += size; d_off += size; may be calculated
twise: first for >= PAGE_SIZE check and later for offset update in "else"
clause).

scripts/bloat-o-meter shows some improvement
