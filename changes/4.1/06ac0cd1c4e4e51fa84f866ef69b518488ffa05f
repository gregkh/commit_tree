ASoC: Intel: Remove support for Intel MID DMA from firmware loader

Intel MID DMA driver is going to be removed by the coming commit
36111da7838e ("dmaengine: intel-mid-dma: remove the driver") in spi.git
tree. Since there are no users for SST_DMA_TYPE_MID type the support for it
can be removed from here in advance.
