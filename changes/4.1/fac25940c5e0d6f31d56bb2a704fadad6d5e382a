net: bcmgenet: fix bcmgenet_open()

If bcmgenet_init_dma() fails, it cleans up after itself. Rx and Tx
DMAs are off, and NAPI instances haven't been netif_napi_add()'ed.
Therefore, we need to skip calling bcmgenet_fini_dma() on the error
handling path. bcmgenet_resume() already does this correctly.
