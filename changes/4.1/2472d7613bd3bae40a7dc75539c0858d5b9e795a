net: packet: use sockaddr_ll fields as storage for skb original length in recvmsg path

As part of an effort to move skb->dropcount to skb->cb[], 4 bytes
of additional room are needed in skb->cb[] in packet sockets.

Store the skb original length in the first two fields of sockaddr_ll
(sll_family and sll_protocol) as they can be derived from the skb when
needed.
