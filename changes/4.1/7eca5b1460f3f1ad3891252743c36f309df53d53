MIPS: Remove redundant IPTI==IPPCI logic

The situation where the timer interrupt is on the same line as the
performance counter interrupt is handled in per_cpu_trap_init() by
setting cp0_perfcount_irq to -1, so there is no need to duplicate the
logic conditional upon cp0_perfcount_irq >= 0 in perf
(init_hw_perf_events()) and oprofile (mipsxx_init()).
