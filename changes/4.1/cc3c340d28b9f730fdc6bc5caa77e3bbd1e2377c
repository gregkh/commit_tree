ASoC: rt5670: export jack suspend/resume APIs

We force enable "Mic Det Power" when a jack is inserted. Also, we
set codec idle_bias_off = true. As a result, codec driver will not
suspend as we expect.

On Braswell, we don't need the jack detection when suspend but need
it after resume, so export the jack suspend/resume APIs which are
provided for machine driver to control during suspend/resume.
