MIPS: Always clear FCSR cause bits after emulation

Clear any FCSR cause bits recorded in the saved FPU context after
emulation in all cases rather than in `do_fpe' only, so that any
unmasked IEEE 754 exception left from emulation does not cause a fatal
kernel-mode FPE hardware exception with the CTC1 instruction used by the
kernel to subsequently restore FCSR hardware from the saved FPU context.
