tcp: prepare CC get_info() access from getsockopt()

We would like that optional info provided by Congestion Control
modules using netlink can also be read using getsockopt()

This patch changes get_info() to put this information in a buffer,
instead of skb, like tcp_get_info(), so that following patch
can reuse this common infrastructure.
