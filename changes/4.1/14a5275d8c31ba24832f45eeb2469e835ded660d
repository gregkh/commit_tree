ocfs2: do not use ocfs2_zero_extend during direct IO

In ocfs2_direct_IO_write, we use ocfs2_zero_extend to zero allocated
clusters in case of cluster not aligned.  But ocfs2_zero_extend uses page
cache, this may happen that it clears the data which blockdev_direct_IO
has already written.

We should use blkdev_issue_zeroout instead of ocfs2_zero_extend during
direct IO.

So fix this issue by introducing ocfs2_direct_IO_zero_extend and
ocfs2_direct_IO_extend_no_holes.
