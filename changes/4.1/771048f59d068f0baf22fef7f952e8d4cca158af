ARM: dts: omap3-pandora: add common device tree

This device tree allows to boot, supports the panel,
framebuffer, touch screen, as well as some more peripherals.
Since there is a OMAP3530 based 600 MHz variant and a DM3730 based
1 GHz variant we must include this common device tree code
in one of two CPU specific device trees.
