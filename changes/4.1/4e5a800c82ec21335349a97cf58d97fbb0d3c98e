ncr5380: Harmonize jiffies conversion with msecs_to_jiffies

Instances of var * HZ / 1000 are replaced by msecs_to_jiffies(var).
In addition some timing constants that assumed HZ 100 were adjusted
to HZ independent settings based on review comments from Michael Schmitz
<schmitzmic@gmail.com> and review of the original drivers in 1.0.31 and
2.2.16.
