md/raid6 algorithms: xor_syndrome() for generic int

Start the algorithms with the very basic one. It is left and right
optimized. That means we can avoid all calculations for unneeded pages
above the right stop offset. For pages below the left start offset we
still need the syndrome multiplication but without reading data pages.
