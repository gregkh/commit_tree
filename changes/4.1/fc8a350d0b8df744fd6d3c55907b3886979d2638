iwlwifi: pcie: fix tracking of cmd_in_flight

The cmd_in_flight tracking was introduced to workaround faulty
power management hardware, by having the driver keep the NIC
awake as long as there are commands in flight. However, some of
the code handling this workaround was unconditionally executed,
which resulted with an inconsistent state where the driver assumed
that the NIC was awake although it wasn't.

Fix this by renaming 'cmd_in_flight' to 'cmd_hold_nic_awake' and
handling the NIC requested awake state only for hardwares for
which the workaround is needed.
