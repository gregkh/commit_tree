thp: cleanup khugepaged startup

Few trivial cleanups:

 - no need to call set_recommended_min_free_kbytes() from
   late_initcall() -- start_khugepaged() calls it;

 - no need to call set_recommended_min_free_kbytes() from
   start_khugepaged() if khugepaged is not started;

 - there isn't much point in running start_khugepaged() if we've just
   set transparent_hugepage_flags to zero;

 - start_khugepaged() is misnamed -- it also used to stop the thread;
