btrfs: unlock i_mutex after attempting to delete subvolume during send

Whenever the check for a send in progress introduced in commit
521e0546c970 (btrfs: protect snapshots from deleting during send) is
hit, we return without unlocking inode->i_mutex. This is easy to see
with lockdep enabled:

[  +0.000059] ================================================
[  +0.000028] [ BUG: lock held when returning to user space! ]
[  +0.000029] 4.0.0-rc5-00096-g3c435c1 #93 Not tainted
[  +0.000026] ------------------------------------------------
[  +0.000029] btrfs/211 is leaving the kernel with locks still held!
[  +0.000029] 1 lock held by btrfs/211:
[  +0.000023]  #0:  (&type->i_mutex_dir_key){+.+.+.}, at: [<ffffffff8135b8df>] btrfs_ioctl_snap_destroy+0x2df/0x7a0

Make sure we unlock it in the error path.
