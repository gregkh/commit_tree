avr32: fix integer overflow in ELF_ET_DYN_BASE

Almost all arches define ELF_ET_DYN_BASE as 2/3 of TASK_SIZE.
Though it seems that some architectures do this in a wrong way.
The problem is that 2*TASK_SIZE may overflow 32-bits so
the real ELF_ET_DYN_BASE becomes wrong.
Fix this overflow by dividing TASK_SIZE prior to multiplying:
	 (TASK_SIZE / 3 * 2)
