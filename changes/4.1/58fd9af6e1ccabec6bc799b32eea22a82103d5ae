Input: Revert "Revert "synaptics - use dmax in input_mt_assign_slots""

This reverts commit 09d042a2eb90 ("Revert "Input: synaptics - use dmax in
input_mt_assign_slots"")

Now that balanced slots assignments seem to be fixed, let's re-enable the
use in synaptics.c and wait for users to complain if there are still
problems.
