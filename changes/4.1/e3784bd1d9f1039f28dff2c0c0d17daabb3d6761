IB/iser: Remove a redundant struct iser_data_buf

No need to keep two iser_data_buf structures just in case we use
mem copy. We can avoid that just by adding a pointer to the original
sg. So keep only two iser_data_buf per command (data and protection)
and pass the relevant data_buf to bounce buffer routine.

This patch does not change any functionality.
