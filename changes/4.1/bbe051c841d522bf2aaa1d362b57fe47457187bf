xfs: disallow ro->rw remount on norecovery mount

There's a bit of a loophole in norecovery mount handling right
now: an initial mount must be readonly, but nothing prevents
a mount -o remount,rw from producing a writable, unrecovered
xfs filesystem.

It might be possible to try to perform a log recovery when this
is requested, but I'm not sure it's worth the effort.  For now,
simply disallow this sort of transition.
