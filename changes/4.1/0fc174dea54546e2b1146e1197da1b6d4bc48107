ebpf: make internal bpf API independent of CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL ifdefs

Socket filter code and other subsystems with upcoming eBPF support should
not need to deal with the fact that we have CONFIG_BPF_SYSCALL defined or
not.

Having the bpf syscall as a config option is a nice thing and I'd expect
it to stay that way for expert users (I presume one day the default setting
of it might change, though), but code making use of it should not care if
it's actually enabled or not.

Instead, hide this via header files and let the rest deal with it.
