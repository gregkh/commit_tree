ACPI / EC: Call acpi_walk_dep_device_list() after installing EC opregion handler

On some machines(E,G Mircosoft surface 3), ACPI battery depends on
the EC operation region and it has _DEP method which contains EC.
Current code doesn't support such devices whose dep_unmet will be
not be decreased after EC opregion handler being installed. This
blocks battery device to be attached with its driver. This patch
is to fix the issue.
