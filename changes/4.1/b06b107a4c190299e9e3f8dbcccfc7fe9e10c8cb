net: dsa: Handle non-bridge master change

Master change notifications may occur other than when joining or
leaving a bridge, for example when being added to or removed from
a bond or Open vSwitch. In that case, do nothing instead of asking
the switch driver to remove a port from a bridge that it didn't join.
