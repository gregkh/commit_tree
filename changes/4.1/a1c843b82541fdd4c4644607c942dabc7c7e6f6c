s390/mm: change swap pte encoding and pgtable cleanup

After the file ptes have been removed the bit combination used to
encode non-linear mappings can be reused for the swap ptes. This
frees up a precious pte software bit. Reflect the change in the
swap encoding in the comments and do some cleanup while we are
at it.
