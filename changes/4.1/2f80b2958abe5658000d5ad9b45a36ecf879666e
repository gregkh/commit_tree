ALSA: usb-audio: don't try to get Outlaw RR2150 sample rate

This quirk allows us to avoid the noisy:

	current rate 0 is different from the runtime rate

message every time playback starts.  While USB DAC in the RR2150
supports reading the sample rate, it never returns a sample rate
other than zero in my observation with common sample rates.
