lib/vsprintf: document %p parameters passed by reference

This patch series improves the documentation for printk() formats, and
adds support for printing clocks.  The latter has always been a hassle if
you wanted to support both the common and legacy clock frameworks.

  - '%pC' and '%pCn' print the name (Common Clock Framework) or address
    (legacy clock framework) of a clock,
  - '%pCr' prints the current clock rate.

This patch (of 3):

Make sure all %p extensions that take parameters by references are
documented to do so.
