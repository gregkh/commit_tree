neigh: Factor out ___neigh_lookup_noref

While looking at the mpls code I found myself writing yet another
version of neigh_lookup_noref.  We currently have __ipv4_lookup_noref
and __ipv6_lookup_noref.

So to make my work a little easier and to make it a smidge easier to
verify/maintain the mpls code in the future I stopped and wrote
___neigh_lookup_noref.  Then I rewote __ipv4_lookup_noref and
__ipv6_lookup_noref in terms of this new function.  I tested my new
version by verifying that the same code is generated in
ip_finish_output2 and ip6_finish_output2 where these functions are
inlined.

To get to ___neigh_lookup_noref I added a new neighbour cache table
function key_eq.  So that the static size of the key would be
available.

I also added __neigh_lookup_noref for people who want to to lookup
a neighbour table entry quickly but don't know which neibhgour table
they are going to look up.
