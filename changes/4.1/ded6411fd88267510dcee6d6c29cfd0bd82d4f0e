qla2xxx: Fix virtual port configuration, when switch port is disabled/enabled.

On some vendor switches, when switch port is toggled (down /up),
then in some condition driver tries to configure virtual port,
before FW is actually in ready state to process any commands on wire.
At this time, configuring virtual port can fail. Add fix in driver
to make driver wait, for FW to be ready state before
