multicast: Extend ip address command to enable multicast group join/leave on

Joining multicast group on ethernet level via "ip maddr" command would
not work if we have an Ethernet switch that does igmp snooping since
the switch would not replicate multicast packets on ports that did not
have IGMP reports for the multicast addresses.

Linux vxlan interfaces created via "ip link add vxlan" have the group option
that enables then to do the required join.

By extending ip address command with option "autojoin" we can get similar
functionality for openvswitch vxlan interfaces as well as other tunneling
mechanisms that need to receive multicast traffic. The kernel code is
structured similar to how the vxlan driver does a group join / leave.

example:
ip address add 224.1.1.10/24 dev eth5 autojoin
ip address del 224.1.1.10/24 dev eth5
