tracing: Give system name a pointer

Normally the compiler will use the same pointer for a string throughout
the file. But there's no guarantee of that happening. Later changes will
require that all events have the same pointer to the system string.

Name the system string and have all events point to it.

Testing this, it did not increases the size of the text, except for the
notes section, which should not harm the real size any.
