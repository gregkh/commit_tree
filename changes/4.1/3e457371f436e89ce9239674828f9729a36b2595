usb: musb: Fix fifo reads for dm816x with musb_dsps

Looks like dm81xx can only do 32-bit fifo reads like am35x. Let's set
up musb-dsps with a custom read_fifo function based on the compatible
flag.

Otherwise we can get the following errors when starting dhclient on a
asix USB Ethernet adapter:

asix 2-1:1.0 eth2: asix_rx_fixup() Bad Header Length 0xffff003c, offset 4

While at it, let's also remove pointless cast of the driver data.
