[media] lbdt3306a: rework at printk macros

Use pr_foo() where there's a direct replacement. For debug, use
custom-made macros, for now, as there are 3 different debug levels.

We should get rid of those some day, specially since several such
macros can be just removed, as Kernel trace would provide about
the same output.

This gets rid of some checkpatch errors:

WARNING: Prefer [subsystem eg: netdev]_info([subsystem]dev, ... then dev_info(dev, ... then pr_info(...  to printk(KERN_INFO ...
+#define lg_info(fmt, arg...)	printk(KERN_INFO "lgdt3306a: " fmt, ##arg)

ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
+#define lg_dbg(fmt, arg...) if (debug & DBG_INFO)			\
+				lg_printk(KERN_DEBUG,         fmt, ##arg)

ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
+#define lg_reg(fmt, arg...) if (debug & DBG_REG)			\
+				lg_printk(KERN_DEBUG,         fmt, ##arg)
