PCI: Export pci_iov_virtfn_bus() and pci_iov_virtfn_devfn()

On PowerNV, some resource reservation is needed for SR-IOV VFs that don't
exist at the bootup stage.  To do the match between resources and VFs, the
code need to get the VF's BDF in advance.

Rename virtfn_bus() and virtfn_devfn() to pci_iov_virtfn_bus() and
pci_iov_virtfn_devfn() and export them.
