drivers/rtc/mc13xxx: Update driver to address y2038/y2106 issues

This driver has a number of y2038/y2106 issues.

This patch resolves them by:

  - Replacing rtc_time_to_tm() with rtc_time64_to_tm()
  - Changing mc13xxx_rtc_set_mmss() to use rtc_class_ops's set_mmss64()

After this patch, the driver should not have any remaining
y2038/y2106 issues.
