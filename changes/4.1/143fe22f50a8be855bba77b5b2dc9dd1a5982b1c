tipc: fix inconsistent signal handling regression

Commit 9bbb4ecc6819 ("tipc: standardize recvmsg routine") changed
the sleep/wakeup behaviour for sockets entering recv() or accept().
In this process the order of reporting -EAGAIN/-EINTR was reversed.
This caused problems with wrong errno being reported back if the
timeout expires. The same problem happens if the socket is
nonblocking and recv()/accept() is called when the process have
pending signals. If there is no pending data read or connections to
accept, -EINTR will be returned instead of -EAGAIN.
