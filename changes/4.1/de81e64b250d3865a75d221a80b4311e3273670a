clockevents: Don't validate dev->mode against CLOCK_EVT_MODE_UNUSED for new interface

It was a requirement in the legacy interface that drivers must
initialize ->mode field to 'CLOCK_EVT_MODE_UNUSED'. This field
isn't used anymore by the new interface and so should be only
checked for the legacy interface.

Probably it can be dropped as well as core doesn't rely on it
anymore, but lets keep it to support legacy interface.
