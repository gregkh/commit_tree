blk-mq: reduce unnecessary software queue looping

In flush_busy_ctxs() and blk_mq_hctx_has_pending(), regardless of how many
ctxs assigned to one hctx, they will all loop hctx->ctx_map.map_size
times. Here hctx->ctx_map.map_size is a const ALIGN(nr_cpu_ids, 8) / 8.
Especially, flush_busy_ctxs() is in hot code path. And it's unnecessary.
Change ->map_size to contain the actually mapped software queues, so we
only loop for as many iterations as we have to.

And remove cpumask setting and nr_ctx count in blk_mq_init_cpu_queues()
since they are all re-done in blk_mq_map_swqueue().
blk_mq_map_swqueue().
