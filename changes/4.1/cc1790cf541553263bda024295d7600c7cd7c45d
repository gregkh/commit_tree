perf/x86: Improve HT workaround GP counter constraint

The (SNB/IVB/HSW) HT bug only affects events that can be programmed
onto GP counters, therefore we should only limit the number of GP
counters that can be used per cpu -- iow we should not constrain the
FP counters.

Furthermore, we should only enfore such a limit when there are in fact
exclusive events being scheduled on either sibling.
