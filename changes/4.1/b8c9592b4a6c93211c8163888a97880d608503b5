ARM: 8318/1: treat CPU feature register fields as signed quantities

The various CPU feature registers consist of 4-bit blocks that
represent signed quantities, whose positive values represent
incremental features, and whose negative values are reserved.

To improve forward compatibility, update the feature detection
code to take possible future higher values into account, but
ignore negative values.
