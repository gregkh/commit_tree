[media] mn88472: One function call less in mn88472_init() after error detection

The release_firmware() function was called in three cases by the mn88472_init()
function during error handling even if the passed variable "fw" contained still
a null pointer.

This implementation detail could be improved by the introduction of another
jump label.
