MIPS: math-emu: Optimise NaN handling in comparisons

We have the input operands already classified in `ieee754sp_cmp' and
`ieee754dp_cmp' comparison operations, so use the class obtained to tell
NaNs and numbers apart rather than classifying inputs again for this
purpose, reducing the size of code by 24 and 40 instructions or 96 and
160 bytes respectively.
