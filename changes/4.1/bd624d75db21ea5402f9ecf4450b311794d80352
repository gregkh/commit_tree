clockevents: Introduce mode specific callbacks

It is not possible for the clockevents core to know which modes (other than
those with a corresponding feature flag) are supported by a particular
implementation. And drivers are expected to handle transition to all modes
elegantly, as ->set_mode() would be issued for them unconditionally.

Now, adding support for a new mode complicates things a bit if we want to use
the legacy ->set_mode() callback. We need to closely review all clockevents
drivers to see if they would break on addition of a new mode. And after such
reviews, it is found that we have to do non-trivial changes to most of the
drivers [1].

Introduce mode-specific set_mode_*() callbacks, some of which the drivers may or
may not implement. A missing callback would clearly convey the message that the
corresponding mode isn't supported.

A driver may still choose to keep supporting the legacy ->set_mode() callback,
but ->set_mode() wouldn't be supporting any new modes beyond RESUME. If a driver
wants to benefit from using a new mode, it would be required to migrate to
the mode specific callbacks.

The legacy ->set_mode() callback and the newly introduced mode-specific
callbacks are mutually exclusive. Only one of them should be supported by the
driver.

Sanity check is done at the time of registration to distinguish between optional
and required callbacks and to make error recovery and handling simpler. If the
legacy ->set_mode() callback is provided, all mode specific ones would be
ignored by the core but a warning is thrown if they are present.

Call sites calling ->set_mode() directly are also updated to use
__clockevents_set_mode() instead, as ->set_mode() may not be available anymore
for few drivers.
