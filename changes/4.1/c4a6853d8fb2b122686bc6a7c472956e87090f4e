ipv6: invert join/leave anycast rtnl/socket locking order

Commit baf606d9c9b1 ("ipv4,ipv6: grab rtnl before locking the socket")
missed to update two setsockopt options, IPV6_JOIN_ANYCAST and
IPV6_LEAVE_ANYCAST, causing a lock inverstion regarding to the updated ones.

As ipv6_sock_ac_join and ipv6_sock_ac_leave are only called from
do_ipv6_setsockopt, we are good to just move the rtnl lock upper.
