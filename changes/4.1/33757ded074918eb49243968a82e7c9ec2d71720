ARM64 / ACPI: Don't unflatten device tree if acpi=force is passed

Since the policy is that once we pass acpi=force in the early
param, we will not unflatten device tree even if ACPI is disabled
in ACPI table init fails, so fix the code by comparinging both
acpi_disabled and param_acpi_force before the device tree is
unflattened.
