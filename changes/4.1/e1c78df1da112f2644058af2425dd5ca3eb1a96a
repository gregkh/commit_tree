ALSA: ctl: fix to handle several elements added by one operation for userspace element

An element instance can have several elements with the same feature.
Some userspace applications can add such an element instance by add
operation with the number of elements. Then, the element instance
gets a memory object to keep states of these elements.

But the element instance has just one memory object for the elements.
This causes the same result to each read/write operations to the
different elements.

This commit fixes this bug by allocating enough memory objects to the
element instance for each of elements.
