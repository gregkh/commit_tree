ARM: rockchip: disable dapswjdp during suspend

Reset dapswjdp is controlled by JTAG_TRSTN, if the iomux of this pin is
not "jtag_trstn". the AP would think this pin is always high, so it can
not reset before resume. When system resume, but the dapswjdp is not in
a default state, it may Access some illegal address, it cause system
crash during resume.
Let's disable this jtag function by clear the dapdeviceen bit, it
prohibit the dapswjdp to access memory and registers. This bit would
be enable in MASKROM, so we need clear it in suspend everytime.
