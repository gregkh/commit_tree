USB: f81232: change lock mechanism

The original driver lock with spin_lock_irqsave()/spin_unlock_irqrestore()
because of it's maybe used in interrupt context f81232_process_read_urb().

We had remove it from previous patch "implement RX bulk-in EP", so we can
change it from busying loop spin_lock to sleepable mutex_lock.
