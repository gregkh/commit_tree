phy: miphy365x: Use the generic phy type constants in dt-bindings/phy/phy.h

Now there are generic phy type constants declared in phy.h, migrate over to
using them rather than defining our own. This change has been done as one
atomic commit to be bisectable.

Note: The values of the defines are the same, so there is no ABI breakage
with this patch.
