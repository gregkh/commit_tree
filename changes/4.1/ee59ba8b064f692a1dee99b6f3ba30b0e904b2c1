UBI: Fix stale pointers in ubi->lookuptbl

In some error paths the WL sub-system gives up on a PEB
and frees it's ubi_wl_entry struct but does not set
the entry in ubi->lookuptbl to NULL.
Fastmap can stumble over such a stale pointer as it uses
ubi->lookuptbl to find all PEBs.

Fix this by introducing a new helper function which free()s
a WL entry and removes the reference from the lookup table.
