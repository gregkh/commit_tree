tomoyo: reduce mmap_sem hold for mm->exe_file

The mm->exe_file is currently serialized with mmap_sem (shared) in order
to both safely (1) read the file and (2) compute the realpath by calling
tomoyo_realpath_from_path, making it an absolute overkill.  Good users
will, on the other hand, make use of the more standard get_mm_exe_file(),
requiring only holding the mmap_sem to read the value, and relying on
reference
