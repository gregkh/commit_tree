MIPS: Push .set mips64r* into the functions needing it

The {save,restore}_fp_context{,32} functions require that the assembler
allows the use of sdc instructions on any FP register, and this is
acomplished by setting the arch to mips64r2 or mips64r6
(using MIPS_ISA_ARCH_LEVEL_RAW).

However this has the effect of enabling the assembler to use mips64
instructions in the expansion of pseudo-instructions. This was done in
the (now-reverted) commit eec43a224cf1 "MIPS: Save/restore MSA context
around signals" which led to my mistakenly believing that there was an
assembler bug, when in reality the assembler was just emitting mips64
instructions. Avoid the issue for future commits which will add code to
r4k_fpu.S by pushing the .set MIPS_ISA_ARCH_LEVEL_RAW directives into
the functions that require it, and remove the spurious assertion
declaring the assembler bug.
