perf/x86/intel: Add cross-HT counter exclusion infrastructure

This patch adds a new shared_regs style structure to the
per-cpu x86 state (cpuc). It is used to coordinate access
between counters which must be used with exclusion across
HyperThreads on Intel processors. This new struct is not
needed on each PMU, thus is is allocated on demand.
