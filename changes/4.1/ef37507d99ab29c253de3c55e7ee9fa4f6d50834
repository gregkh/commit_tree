x86/vdso: Teach 'make clean' to remove generated vdso-image-*.c files

After 'make clean' the following files were left in arch/x86/vdso/:

  vdso-image-32-int80.c
  vdso-image-32-syscall.c
  vdso-image-32-sysenter.c

These file are generated during the build process and are present
in .gitignore, so remove them.
