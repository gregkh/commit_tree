ARM64: Enable CONFIG_GENERIC_IRQ_SHOW_LEVEL

Since several interrupt controllers including GIC support both edge and
level triggered interrupts, it's useful to provide that information in
/proc/interrupts even on ARM64 similar to ARM and PPC.

This is based on Geert Uytterhoeven's commit 7c07005eea96 ("ARM: 8339/1:
Enable CONFIG_GENERIC_IRQ_SHOW_LEVEL")
