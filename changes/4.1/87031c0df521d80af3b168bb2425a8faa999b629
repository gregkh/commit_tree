ixgbe: Remove NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER from hw_features

This change makes it so that the HW_VLAN_CTAG_FILTER bit is not falsely
advertised as being a feature that can be toggled on ixgbe parts.  The
driver was setting the bit in features and letting it be inherited by
hw_features, however the driver was actually ignoring the value of the bit
and just assuming it was always set.  As a result VLAN filtering was always
enabled which is a requirement for SR-IOV, VMDq, DCB, FCoE, and possibly
other features within the adapters.
