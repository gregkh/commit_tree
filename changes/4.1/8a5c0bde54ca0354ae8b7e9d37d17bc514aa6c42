drm/atomic: Clear crtcs, connectors and planes when clearing state

Users of the atomic state assume that if the pointer to a crtc, plane or
connector is not NULL in the respective object vector, than the state
for that object in *_states vector also won't be NULL. That assumption
was broken by drm_atomic_state_clear(), which would clear the state
pointer but leave the pointer to the object still set.

This fixes a NULL pointer dereference in i915 caused by the use of
drm_atomic_state_clear().
