ARM: perf: Only reset PMxEVCNTCR registers on reset

The Krait specific PMxEVCNTCR register is unpredictable upon
reset. Currently we clear the register before we setup an event,
but we don't need to do that. Instead, we can iterate through all
the events and clear them once when we reset the PMU, saving a
write in the event setup path.
