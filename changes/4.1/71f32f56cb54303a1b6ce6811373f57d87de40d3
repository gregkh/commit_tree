clk: sunxi: Add support for sun9i A80 USB clocks and resets

The USB controller/phy clocks and reset controls are in a separate
address block, unlike previous SoCs where they were in the clock
controller. Also, access to the address block is controlled by a
clock gate to AHB.

Add support for resets requiring a clock to be enabled when
asserting/deasserting the reset controls, and add the sun9i USB
clocks.
