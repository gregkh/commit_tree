dm: requeue from blk-mq dm_mq_queue_rq() using BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_BUSY

Use BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_BUSY to requeue a blk-mq request directly from the
DM blk-mq device's .queue_rq.  This cleans up the previous convoluted
handling of request requeueing that would return BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_OK
(even though it wasn't) and then run blk_mq_requeue_request() followed
by blk_mq_kick_requeue_list().

Also, document that DM blk-mq ontop of old request_fn devices cannot
fail in clone_rq() since the clone request is preallocated as part of
the pdu.
