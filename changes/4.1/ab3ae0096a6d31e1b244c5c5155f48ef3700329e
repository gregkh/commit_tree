mei: fix regression on NFC connection

In mei_host_client_init function we enable the all internal
connected clients including NFC. This is done before we set the device
to enabled state and let userspace call open.
We need to check only for MEI_FILE_CONNECTED in mei_cl_is_connected
in order to enable the communication with the clients before
MEI_DEV_ENABLED is set.
