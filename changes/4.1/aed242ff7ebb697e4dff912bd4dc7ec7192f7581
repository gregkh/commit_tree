drm/i915: Relax RPS contraints to allows setting minfreq on idle

When we idle, we set the GPU frequency to the hardware minimum (not user
minimum). We introduce a new variable to distinguish between the
different roles, and to allow easy tuning of the idle frequency without
impacting over aspects of RPS. Setting the minimum frequency should be a
safety blanket as the pcu on the GPU should be power gating itself
anyway. However, in order for us to do set the absolute minimum
frequency, we need to relax a few of our assertions that we do not
exceed the user limits.

v2: Add idle_freq
v3: Init idle_freq for vlv and add a bunch of WARNs
