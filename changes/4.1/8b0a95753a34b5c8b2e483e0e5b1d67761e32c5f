arm64: merge __enable_mmu and __turn_mmu_on

Enabling of the MMU is split into two functions, with an align and
a branch in the middle. On arm64, the entire kernel Image is ID mapped
so this is really not necessary, and we can just merge it into a
single function.

Also replaces an open coded adrp/add reference to __enable_mmu pair
with adr_l.
