ALSA: hda - Re-add tracepoints to HD-audio core driver

Now let's take the basic tracepoints back to the HD-audio driver.
The three bus tracepoints, hda_send_cmd, hda_get_response and
hda_unsol_event are revived but in a slightly different form.
Since we don't assign the card number there, print the bus device name
instead.
