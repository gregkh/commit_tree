tipc: clean up handling of link congestion

After the recent changes in message importance handling it becomes
possible to simplify handling of messages and sockets when we
encounter link congestion.

We merge the function tipc_link_cong() into link_schedule_user(),
and simplify the code of the latter. The code should now be
easier to follow, especially regarding return codes and handling
of the message that caused the situation.

In case the scheduling function is unable to pre-allocate a wakeup
message buffer, it now returns -ENOBUFS, which is a more correct
code than the previously used -EHOSTUNREACH.
