MIPS: Set `si_code' for SIGFPE signals sent from emulation too

Rework `process_fpemu_return' and move IEEE 754 exception interpretation
there, from `do_fpe'.  Record the cause bits set in FCSR before they are
cleared and pass them through to `process_fpemu_return' so as to set
`si_code' correctly too for SIGFPE signals sent from emulation rather
than those issued by hardware with the FPE processor exception only.

For simplicity `mipsr2_decoder' assumes `*fcr31' has been preinitialised
and only sets it to anything if an FPU instruction has been emulated,
which in turn is the only case SIGFPE can be issued for here.
