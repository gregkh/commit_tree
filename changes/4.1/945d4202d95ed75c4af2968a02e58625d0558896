iwlwifi: mvm: restart firmware recording when no configuration is set

Sometimes the firmware will have a hard coded configuration.
In this case, the driver won't find any configuration
in the firmware file, and it will have to re-start
recording in case it has been stopped. This can't be done
by the configuration host command since there is no such
host command configured. Do that with the registers instead.
