iwlwifi: mvm: Clean up UMAC scan UIDs in the reset and drv_stop flows

In the reset flow, the driver cancels ongoing scan and sends scan
complete notification to mac80211. However it does not clean its UID.
Add cleaning scan UID for the ongoing scan. Loop over all other UIDs
to make sure there's nothing left there and warn if any is found.
