ALSA: core: selection of audio_tstamp type and accuracy reports

Audio timestamps can be extracted from sample counters, wall clocks,
PHC clocks (Ethernet AVB), on-demand synchronized snapshots. This
patch provides the ability to report timestamping capabilities, select
timestamp types and retrieve timestamp accuracy, if supported.
Details can be found in Documentations/sound/alsa/timestamping.txt

This functionality is introduced by reclaiming the reserved_aligned
field introduced by commit9c7066aef4a5eb8e4063de28f06c508bf6f2963a
in snd_pcm_status to provide userspace with selection/query capabilities.
Additional driver_tstamp and audio_tstamp_accuracy fields are also added.

snd_pcm_mmap_status remains a read-only structure with only
the audio timestamp value accessible from user space. The selection
of audio timestamp type is done through snd_pcm_status only

This commit does not impact ABI and does not impact the default
behavior. By default audio timestamp is aligned with hw_pointer and
reports the DMA position. Backwards compatibility is handled by using
the HDAudio wall clock for playback and the hw_ptr for all other
cases.

For timestamp selection a new STATUS_EXT ioctl is introduced with
read/write parameters. Alsa-lib will be modified to make use of
STATUS_EXT.
