of/fdt: Remove "reg" data prints from early_init_dt_scan_memory

Commit 51975db0b7333 ("of/flattree: merge early_init_dt_scan_memory()
common code") consolidated some code from PowerPC (typically
big-endian), and ended-up adding a pr_debug() printing reg properties in
big-endian (DT native) format, not CPU endian.

This debug print suffers from two problems:
- we only print 4 "reg" values, while there could be more on typical
  systems having multiple memory ranges
- we print these 4 "reg" values in FDT endianess, that is big-endian,
  and these values could be confusing for little-endian configurations

Since we are already printing the base address and size of the memory
regions parsed by early_init_dt_scan_memory() later in a way that is
both endian correct, and takes into account arbitrary number of memory
banks, just remove that part of the debug print.
