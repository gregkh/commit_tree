module: do not print allocation-fail warning on bogus user buffer size

init_module(2) passes user-specified buffer length directly to
vmalloc(). It makes warn_alloc_failed() to print out a lot of info into
dmesg if user specified insane size, like -1.

Let's silence the warning. It doesn't add much value to -ENOMEM return
code. Without the patch the syscall is prohibitive noisy for testing
with trinity.
