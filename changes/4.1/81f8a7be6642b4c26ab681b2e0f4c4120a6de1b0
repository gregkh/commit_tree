mmc: Add support for marking hpi as broken through devicetree

The eMMC on a tablet I've will stop working / communicating as soon as
the kernel executes:

		mmc_switch(card, EXT_CSD_CMD_SET_NORMAL,
 				EXT_CSD_HPI_MGMT, 1,
 				card->ext_csd.generic_cmd6_time);

There seems to be no way to reliable identify eMMC-s which have a broken
hpi implementation, but at least for eMMC's which are soldered onto a board
we can work around this by specifying that hpi is broken in devicetree.
