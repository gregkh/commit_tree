powerpc: Change vsrX register defines to vsX to match gcc and glibc

As our various loops (copy, string, crypto etc) get more complicated,
we want to share implementations between userspace (eg glibc) and
the kernel. We also want to write userspace test harnesses to put
in tools/testing/selftest.

One gratuitous difference between userspace and the kernel is the
VSX register definitions - the kernel uses vsrX whereas gcc uses
vsX.

Change the kernel to match userspace.
