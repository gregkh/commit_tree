clk: Rename child_node to clks_node to avoid confusion

The child_node member of struct clk is named the same as the
child_node member of struct clk_core. Let's rename the struct
clk's member to clks_node to avoid getting confused with the
child_node member of struct clk_core and to match the name of the
list head, clks.
