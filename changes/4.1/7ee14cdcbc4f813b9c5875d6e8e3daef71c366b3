drm/exynos: remove struct *_win_data abstraction on planes

struct {fimd,mixer,vidi}_win_data was just keeping the same data
as struct exynos_drm_plane thus get ride of it and use exynos_drm_plane
directly.

It changes how planes are created and remove .win_mode_set() callback
that was only filling all *_win_data structs.

v2: check for return of exynos_plane_init()
