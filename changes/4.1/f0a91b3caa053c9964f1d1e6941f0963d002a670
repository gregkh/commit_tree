irq/tracing: Export enums in tracepoints to user space

The enums used by the softirq mapping is what is shown in the output
of the __print_symbolic() and not their values, that are needed
to map them to their strings. Export them to userspace with the
TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM() macro so that user space tools can map the enums
with their values.
