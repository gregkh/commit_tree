target/file: Fix SG table for prot_buf initialization

In fd_do_prot_rw(), it allocates prot_buf which is used to copy from
se_cmd->t_prot_sg by sbc_dif_copy_prot().  The SG table for prot_buf
is also initialized by allocating 'se_cmd->t_prot_nents' entries of
scatterlist and setting the data length of each entry to PAGE_SIZE
at most.

However if se_cmd->t_prot_sg contains a clustered entry (i.e.
sg->length > PAGE_SIZE), the SG table for prot_buf can't be
initialized correctly and sbc_dif_copy_prot() can't copy to prot_buf.
(This actually happened with TCM loopback fabric module)

As prot_buf is allocated by kzalloc() and it's physically contiguous,
we only need a single scatterlist entry.
