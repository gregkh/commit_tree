virtio: pass baton to Michael Tsirkin

With my job change kernel work will be "own time"; I'm keeping lguest
and modules (and the virtio standards work), but virtio kernel has to
go.

This makes it clear that Michael is in charge.  He's good, but having
me watch over his shoulder won't help.

Good luck Michael!
