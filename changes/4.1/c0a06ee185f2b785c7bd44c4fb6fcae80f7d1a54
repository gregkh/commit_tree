igb: Fix oops on changing number of rings

When changing the number of rings by ethtool -L, q_vectors are reused,
which causes oops because of uninitialized pointers.

- When an rx is reused as a tx, q_vector->rx.ring is not set to NULL, which
  misleads igb_poll() to determine that it has an rx ring although it
  actually points to the tx ring.
- When a tx is reused as an rx, q_vector->rx.ring->skb
  (q_vector->ring[0].skb) has a value that was used as tx_stats before.

Fix these problems by zeroing it out on reuseing it.
