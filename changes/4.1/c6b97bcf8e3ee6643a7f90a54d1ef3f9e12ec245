EDAC: Properly unwind on failure path in edac_init()

edac_init() does not deallocate already allocated resources on failure
path.

Found by Linux Driver Verification project (linuxtesting.org).

 [ Boris: The unwind path functions have __exit annotation but are being
   used in an __init function, leading to section mismatches. Drop the
   section annotation and make them normal functions. ]
