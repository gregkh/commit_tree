dmaengine: append hsu DMA driver

The HSU DMA is developed to support High Speed UART controllers found in
particular on Intel MID platforms such as Intel Medfield.

The existing implementation is tighten to the drivers/tty/serial/mfd.c driver
and has a lot of disadvantages. Besides that we would like to get rid of the
old HS UART driver in regarding to extending the 8250 which supports generic
DMAEngine API. That's why the current driver has been developed.
