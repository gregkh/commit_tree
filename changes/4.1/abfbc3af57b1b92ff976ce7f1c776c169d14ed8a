mac80211: remove TX latency measurement code

Revert commit ad38bfc916da ("mac80211: Tx frame latency statistics")
(along with some follow-up fixes).

This code turned out not to be as useful in the current form as we
thought, and we've internally hacked it up more, but that's not
very suitable for upstream (for now), and we might just do that
with tracing instead.

Therefore, for now at least, remove this code. We might also need
to use the skb->tstamp field for the TCP performance issue, which
is more important than the debugging.
