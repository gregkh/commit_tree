ALSA: hda - Fix mute-LED fixed mode

The mute-LED mode control has the fixed on/off states that are
supposed to remain on/off regardless of the master switch.  However,
this doesn't work actually because the vmaster hook is called in the
vmaster code itself.

This patch fixes it by calling the hook indirectly after checking the
mute LED mode.
