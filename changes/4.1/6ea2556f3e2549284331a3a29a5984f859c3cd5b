drm/i915: Do both mt and gen6 style forcewake reset on ivb probe

commit 05a2fb157e44 ("drm/i915: Consolidate forcewake code")
failed to take into account that we have used to reset both
the gen6 style and the multithreaded style forcewake registers.
This is due to fact that ivb can use either, depending on how the
bios has set up the machine.

Mimic the old semantics before we have determined the correct variety
and reset both before the ecobus probe.
