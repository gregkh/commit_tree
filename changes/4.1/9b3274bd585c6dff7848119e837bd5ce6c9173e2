MIPS: Add arch CDMM definitions and probing

Add architectural definitions and probing for the MIPS Common Device
Memory Map (CDMM) region. When supported and enabled at a particular
physical address, this region allows some number of per-CPU devices to
be discovered and controlled via MMIO.

A bit exists in Config3 to determine whether the feature is present, and
a CDMMBase CP0 register allows the region to be enabled at a particular
physical address.
