ALSA: emux: Fix mutex deadlock in OSS emulation

The OSS emulation in synth-emux helper has a potential AB/BA deadlock
at the simultaneous closing and opening:

  close ->
    snd_seq_release() ->
      sne_seq_free_client() ->
        snd_seq_delete_all_ports(): takes client->ports_mutex ->
	  port_delete() ->
	    snd_emux_unuse(): takes emux->register_mutex

  open ->
    snd_seq_oss_open() ->
      snd_emux_open_seq_oss(): takes emux->register_mutex ->
        snd_seq_event_port_attach() ->
	  snd_seq_create_port(): takes client->ports_mutex

This patch addresses the deadlock by reducing the rance taking
emux->register_mutex in snd_emux_open_seq_oss().  The lock is needed
for the refcount handling, so move it locally.  The calls in
emux_seq.c are already with the mutex, thus they are replaced with the
version without mutex lock/unlock.
