amd-xgbe: Move Rx mode configuration into init

Currently a call to configure the Rx mode (promiscuous mode, all
multicast mode, etc.) is made in xgbe_start separate from the xgbe_init
function. This call to set the Rx mode should be part of the xgbe_init
function so that calls to the init function don't have to be preceded
with calls to configure the Rx mode.
