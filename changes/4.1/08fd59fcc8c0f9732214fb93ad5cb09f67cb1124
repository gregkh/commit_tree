drm/i915: Move vblank wait determination to 'check' phase

Determining whether we'll need to wait for vblanks is something we
should determine during the atomic 'check' phase, not the 'commit'
phase.  Note that we only set these bits in the branch of 'check' where
intel_crtc->active is true so that we don't try to wait on a disabled
CRTC.

The whole 'wait for vblank after update' flag should go away in the
future, once we start handling watermarks in a proper atomic manner.

This regression has been introduced in
