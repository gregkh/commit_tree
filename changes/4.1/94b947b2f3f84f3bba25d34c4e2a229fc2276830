btrfs: fix condition of commit transaction

Old code bypass commit transaction when we don't have enough
pinned space, but another case is there exist freed bgs in current
transction, it have possibility to make alloc_chunk success.

This patch modify the condition to:
if (have_free_bg || have_pinned_space) commit_transaction()

Confirmed above action by printk before and after patch.
