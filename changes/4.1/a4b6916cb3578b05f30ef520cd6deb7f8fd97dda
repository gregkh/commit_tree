ARM: tegra: Correct which USB controller has the UTMI pad registers

It should be the first controller, not the second. The indexes of the
usb resets were also wrong and have been fixed.

The issue was caused by the changes in 308efde ("ARM: tegra: Add resets
& has-utmi-pad-registers flag to all USB PHYs") being misapplied by git
due to the patch context being insufficient.

This broke USB after 6261b06 ("regulator: Defer lookup of supply to
regulator_get"), because it changed the order in which the controllers
were probed.

The fix for this issue was suggested by Mikko Perttunen and Tuomas
Tynkkynen.
