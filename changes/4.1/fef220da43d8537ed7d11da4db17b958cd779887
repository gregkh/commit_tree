i2c: i801: Use managed pcim_* PCI device initialization and reservation

Simplifies the code a bit and makes easier to disable PCI device on driver
detach by removing the pcim_pin_device() call in the future if needed.

Reason why i2c-i801.c doesn't ever call pci_disable_device() was because it
made some systems to hang during power-off. See commit d6fcb3b9cf77
("[PATCH] i2c-i801.c: don't pci_disable_device() after it was just enabled")
