x86: switch to using asm-generic for seccomp.h

Switch to using the newly created asm-generic/seccomp.h for the seccomp
strict mode syscall definitions. The obsolete sigreturn syscall override
is retained in 32-bit mode, and the ia32 syscall overrides are used in
the compat case. Remaining definitions were identical.
