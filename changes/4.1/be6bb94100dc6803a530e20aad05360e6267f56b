lpfc: Fix premature release of rpi bit in bitmask

Currently, the driver plays off the fact that older sli4 adapters have a
different rpi access pattern that allowed for the rpi reference to be
released earlier in the teardown sequence, allowing the driver to recycle
the rpi value sooner. Newer sli4 adapters have a different access pattern that
requires us to wait for a later mailbox completion. This changes the put
call location on the newer sli4 adapters.

Symptoms of the error are "0110 ELS" and the "0372 iotag" errors.
