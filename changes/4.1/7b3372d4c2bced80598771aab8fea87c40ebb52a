iommu-common: rename iommu_pool_hash to iommu_hash_common

When CONFIG_DEBUG_FORCE_WEAK_PER_CPU is set, the DEFINE_PER_CPU_SECTION
macro will define an extern __pcpu_unique_##name variable that could
conflict with the same definition in powerpc at this time. Avoid that
conflict by renaming iommu_pool_hash in iommu-common.c

Thanks to Guenter Roeck for catching this, and helping to test the fix.
