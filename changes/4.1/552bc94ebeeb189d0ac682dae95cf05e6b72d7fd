PCI: Preserve resource size during alignment reordering

In d74b9027a4da ("PCI: Consider additional PF's IOV BAR alignment in sizing
and assigning"), we store additional alignment in realloc_head and take
this into consideration for assignment.

In __assign_resources_sorted(), we changed dev_res->res->start, then used
resource_start() (which depends on res->start), so the recomputed res->end
was completely bogus.  Even if we'd had the correct size, the end would
have been off by one.

Preserve the resource size when we adjust its alignment.
