xen/blkback: safely unmap purge persistent grants

Commit c43cf3ea8385 ("xen-blkback: safely unmap grants in case they
are still in use") use gnttab_unmap_refs_async() to wait until the
mapped pages are no longer in use before unmapping them, but that
commit missed the persistent case.  Purge persistent pages can't be
unmapped either unless no longer in use.
