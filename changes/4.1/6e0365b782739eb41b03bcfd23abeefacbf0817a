KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add ICP real mode counters

Add two counters to count how often we generate real-mode ICS resend
and reject events. The counters provide some performance statistics
that could be used in the future to consider if the real mode functions
need further optimizing. The counters are displayed as part of IPC and
ICP state provided by /sys/debug/kernel/powerpc/kvm* for each VM.

Also added two counters that count (approximately) how many times we
don't find an ICP or ICS we're looking for. These are not currently
exposed through sysfs, but can be useful when debugging crashes.
