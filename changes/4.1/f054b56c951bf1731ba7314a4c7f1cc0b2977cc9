blk-mq: fix race between timeout and CPU hotplug

Firstly during CPU hotplug, even queue is freezed, timeout
handler still may come and access hctx->tags, which may cause
use after free, so this patch deactivates timeout handler
inside CPU hotplug notifier.

Secondly, tags can be shared by more than one queues, so we
have to check if the hctx has been unmapped, otherwise
still use-after-free on tags can be triggered.
