netfilter: reject: don't send icmp error if csum is invalid

tcp resets are never emitted if the packet that triggers the
reject/reset has an invalid checksum.

For icmp error responses there was no such check.
It allows to distinguish icmp response generated via

iptables -I INPUT -p udp --dport 42 -j REJECT

and those emitted by network stack (won't respond if csum is invalid,
REJECT does).

Arguably its possible to avoid this by using conntrack and only
using REJECT with -m conntrack NEW/RELATED.

However, this doesn't work when connection tracking is not in use
or when using nf_conntrack_checksum=0.

Furthermore, sending errors in response to invalid csums doesn't make
much sense so just add similar test as in nf_send_reset.

Validate csum if needed and only send the response if it is ok.
