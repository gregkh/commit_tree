perf probe: Allow weak symbols to be probed

It currently prevents adding probes in weak symbols.  But there're cases
that given name is an only weak symbol so that we cannot add probe.

  $ perf probe -x /usr/lib/libc.so.6 -a calloc
  Failed to find symbol calloc in /usr/lib/libc-2.21.so
    Error: Failed to add events.

  $ nm /usr/lib/libc.so.6 | grep calloc
  000000000007b1f0 t __calloc
  000000000007b1f0 T __libc_calloc
  000000000007b1f0 W calloc

This change will result in duplicate probes when strong and weak symbols
co-exist in a binary.  But I think it's not a big problem since probes
at the weak symbol will never be hit anyway.
