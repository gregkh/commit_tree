drm/i915: Fix atomic state when reusing the firmware fb

Right now, we get a warning when taking over the firmware fb:

  [drm:drm_atomic_plane_check] FB set but no CRTC

with the following backtrace:

  [<ffffffffa010339d>] drm_atomic_check_only+0x35d/0x510 [drm]
  [<ffffffffa0103567>] drm_atomic_commit+0x17/0x60 [drm]
  [<ffffffffa00a6ccd>] drm_atomic_helper_plane_set_property+0x8d/0xd0 [drm_kms_helper]
  [<ffffffffa00f1fed>] drm_mode_plane_set_obj_prop+0x2d/0x90 [drm]
  [<ffffffffa00a8a1b>] restore_fbdev_mode+0x6b/0xf0 [drm_kms_helper]
  [<ffffffffa00aa969>] drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode_unlocked+0x29/0x80 [drm_kms_helper]
  [<ffffffffa00aa9e2>] drm_fb_helper_set_par+0x22/0x50 [drm_kms_helper]
  [<ffffffffa050a71a>] intel_fbdev_set_par+0x1a/0x60 [i915]
  [<ffffffff813ad444>] fbcon_init+0x4f4/0x580

That's because we update the plane state with the fb from the firmware, but we
never associate the plane to that CRTC.

We don't quite have the full DRM take over from HW state just yet, so
fake enough of the plane atomic state to pass the checks.

v2: Fix the state on which we set the CRTC in the case we're sharing the
    initial fb with another pipe. (Matt)
