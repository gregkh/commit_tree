x86/fpu: Don't abuse FPU in kernel threads if use_eager_fpu()

AFAICS, there is no reason why kernel threads should have FPU context
even if use_eager_fpu() == T. Now that interrupted_kernel_fpu_idle()
does not check __thread_has_fpu() in the use_eager_fpu() case, we
can remove the init_fpu() code from eager_fpu_init() and change
flush_thread() called by do_execve() to initialize FPU.

Note: of course, the change in flush_thread() is horrible and must be
cleanuped. We need the new helper, and flush_thread() should return the
error if init_fpu() fails.
