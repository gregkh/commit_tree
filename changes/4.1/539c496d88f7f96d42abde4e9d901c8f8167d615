Bluetooth: Convert connect_cfm to be triggered through hci_cb

This patch moves all the connect_cfm callbacks to be based on the hci_cb
list. This means making l2cap_connect_cfm private to l2cap_core.c and
sco_connect_cb private to sco.c respectively. Since the hci_conn type
filtering isn't done any more on the wrapper level the callbacks
themselves need to check that they were passed a relevant type of
connection.
