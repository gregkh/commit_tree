    drm/atomic-helpers: Recover full cursor plane behaviour

we've added a hack to atomic helpers to never to vblank waits for
cursor updates through the legacy apis since that's what X expects.
Unfortunately we've (again) forgotten to adjust the transitional
helpers. Do this now.

This fixes regressions for drivers only partially converted over to
atomic (like i915).
