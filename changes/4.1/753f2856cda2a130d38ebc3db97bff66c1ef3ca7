md raid0: access mddev->queue (request queue member) conditionally because it is not set when accessed from dm-raid

The patch makes 3 references to mddev->queue in the raid0 personality
conditional in order to allow for it to be accessed from dm-raid.
Mandatory, because md instances underneath dm-raid don't manage
a request queue of their own which'd lead to oopses without the patch.
