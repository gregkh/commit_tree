perf/x86/intel: Enable conflicting event scheduling for CQM

We can leverage the workqueue that we use for RMID rotation to support
scheduling of conflicting monitoring events. Allowing events that
monitor conflicting things is done at various other places in the perf
subsystem, so there's precedent there.

An example of two conflicting events would be monitoring a cgroup and
simultaneously monitoring a task within that cgroup.

This uses the cache_groups list as a queuing mechanism, where every
event that reaches the front of the list gets the chance to be scheduled
in, possibly descheduling any conflicting events that are running.
