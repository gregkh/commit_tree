KVM: arm/arm64: implement kvm_io_bus MMIO handling for the VGIC

Currently we use a lot of VGIC specific code to do the MMIO
dispatching.
Use the previous reworks to add kvm_io_bus style MMIO handlers.

Those are not yet called by the MMIO abort handler, also the actual
VGIC emulator function do not make use of it yet, but will be enabled
with the following patches.
