i40e: Add method to keep track of current rxnfc settings

This patch adds a struct to the VSI struct to keep track of rxnfc
settings done via ethtool.  Without this patch, the device can only
list the options available, not the current settings and this is not
clear to the user.  Without current settings, the available settings
never changing looks like a bug.

Also update the copyright year.
