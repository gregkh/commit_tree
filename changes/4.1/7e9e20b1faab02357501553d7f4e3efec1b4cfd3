ARM: dts: fix mmc node updates for exynos5250-spring

Resolve a merge conflict with mmc refactoring aaa25a5a33cb ("ARM: dts:
unuse the slot-node and deprecate the supports-highspeed for dw-mmc in
exynos") by dropping the slot@0 nodes, moving its bus-width property to
the mmc node and replacing supports-highspeed with cap-{mmc,sd}-highspeed,
matching exynos5250-snow.
