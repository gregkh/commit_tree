Chipidea: Set connect-at-fullspeed bit when entering host mode if CI_HDRC_FORCE_FULLSPEED is set in the platform data

PORTSC_PFSC is not set on entering host mode which means the USB OTG
controller will attempt to enumerate USB devices at high speed even when the
CI_HDRC_FORCE_FULLSPEED flag is set in the platform data.

This patch ensures it is set right before host mode operations begin if needed.
