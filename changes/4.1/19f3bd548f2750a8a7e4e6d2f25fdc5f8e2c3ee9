mfd: rtsx: Remove LCTLR defination

To enable/disable ASPM we should find LINK CONTROL register
in PCI config space. All old chip use 0x80 address, but new
chip may use another address, so we using pci_find_capability()
to get LINK CONTROL address.

rtsx_gops.c was removed, we consider to put some common operations
to this file, but the actual thing is, only a group of chips
are in common ops1, and another group of chips in common ops2,
it is hard to decide put which ops into generic ops file.
