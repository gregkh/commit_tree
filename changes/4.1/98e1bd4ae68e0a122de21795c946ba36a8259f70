drm/i915: Cache ringbuf pointer in request structure

In execlist mode, the ringbuf is a function of the ring and context whereas in
legacy mode, it is derived from the ring alone. Thus the calculation required to
determine the ringbuf pointer from the ring (and context) also needs to test
execlist mode or not. This is messy.

Further, the request structure holds a pointer to both the ring and the context
for which it was created. Thus, given a request, it is possible to derive the
ringbuf in either legacy or execlist mode. Hence it is necessary to pass just
the request in to all the low level functions rather than some combination of
request, ring, context and ringbuf. However, rather than recalculating it each
time, it is much simpler to just cache the ringbuf pointer in the request
structure itself.

Caching the pointer means the calculation is done once at request creation time
and all further code and simply read it directly from the request structure.
