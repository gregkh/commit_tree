x86/asm/entry/32: Document the 32-bit SYSENTER "emergency stack" better

Before the patch, the 'tss_struct::stack' field was not referenced anywhere.

It was used only to set SYSENTER's stack to point after the last byte
of tss_struct, thus the trailing field, stack[64], was used.

But grep would not know it. You can comment it out, compile,
and kernel will even run until an unlucky NMI corrupts
io_bitmap[] (which is also not easily detectable).

This patch changes code so that the purpose and usage of this
field is not mysterious anymore, and can be easily grepped for.

This does change generated code, for a subtle reason:
since tss_struct is ____cacheline_aligned, there happens to be
5 longs of padding at the end. Old code was using the padding
too; new code will strictly use it only for SYSENTER_stack[].
