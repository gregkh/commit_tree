PM / domains: avoid potential oops in pm_genpd_remove_device()

pm_genpd_remove_device() tries hard to validate the generic PM domain
passed to it, but the validation is not complete.

dev->pm_domain contains a struct dev_pm_domain, which is the "base
class" of generic PM domains.  Other users of dev_pm_domains include
stuff like vga_switheroo.  Hence, a device could have a generic PM
domain or a vga_switcheroo PM domain in dev->pm_domain.

We need ot be certain that the PM domain is actually valid before we
try to remove it.  We can do this easily as we have a way to get the
current validated generic PM domain for a struct device.  This must
match the generic PM domain being requested for removal.

Convert the code to use this alternative validation method instead.
