driver core / ACPI: Represent ACPI companions using fwnode_handle

Now that we have struct fwnode_handle, we can use that to point to
ACPI companions from struct device objects instead of pointing to
struct acpi_device directly.

There are two benefits from that.  First, the somewhat ugly and
hackish struct acpi_dev_node can be dropped and, second, the same
struct fwnode_handle pointer can be used in the future to point
to other (non-ACPI) firmware device node types.
