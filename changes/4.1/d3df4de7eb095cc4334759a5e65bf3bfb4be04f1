modpost: fix inverted logic in is_extable_fault_address().

As Guenter pointed out, we want to assert that extable_entry_size has been
discovered and not the other way around.  Moreover, this sanity check is
only valid when we're not dealing with the first relocation in __ex_table,
since we have not discovered the extable entry size at that point.

This was leading to a divide-by-zero on some architectures and make the
build fail.
