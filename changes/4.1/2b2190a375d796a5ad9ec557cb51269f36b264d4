i2c: change input parameter to i2c_adapter for prepare/unprepare_recovery

This patch changes type of input parameter for
prepare/unprepare_recovery() callbacks from struct i2c_bus_recovery_info
* to struct i2c_adapter *. This allows to simplify implementation of
these callbacks and avoid type conversations from i2c_bus_recovery_info
to i2c_adapter. The i2c_bus_recovery_info can be simply retrieved from
struct i2c_adapter which contains pointer on it. There are no users
currently, so this is safe to do.
