drivers/base: cacheinfo: handle absence of caches

On some simulators like GEM5, caches may not be simulated. In those
cases, the cache levels and leaves will be zero and will result in
following exception:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0040
pgd = ffffffc0008fa000
[00000040] *pgd=00000009f6807003, *pud=00000009f6807003,

kcalloc(0) returns a special value ZERO_SIZE_PTR which is non-NULL value
but results in fault only on any attempt to dereferencing it. So
checking for the non-NULL pointer will not suffice.

This patch checks for non-zero cache leaf nodes and returns error if
there are no cache leaves in detect_cache_attributes.
