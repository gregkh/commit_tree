ARM: mvebu: use stdout-path in all armada-*.dts

This commit adds the stdout-path property in /chosen for all Armada
boards that were not yet carrying this property, and gets rid of
/chosen/bootargs which becomes unneeded: earlyprintk should not be
used by default, and the console= parameter is replaced by the
/chosen/stdout-path property.
