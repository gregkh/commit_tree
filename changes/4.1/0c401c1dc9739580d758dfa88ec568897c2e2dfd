staging: rtl8192e: remove extra parentheses around right bit shift operation

Removes extra parentheses around bitwise right shift operation.
The cases handled are  when the resultant value is assigned to
a variable or when a shift operation is carried out for a function
argument. The issues were detected and resolved using the following
coccinelle script:

@@
expression e, e1;
constant c;
@@

e =
-(e1
+e1
>>
-c);
+c;

@@
identifier i;
constant c;
type t;
expression e;
@@

t i =
-(e
+e
>>
-c);
+c;

@@
expression e, e1;
identifier f;
constant c;
@@

e1 = f(...,
-(e
+e
>>
-c)
+c
,...);

Some coding style issues were handled manually to avoid
checkpatch warnings and errors.
