arm-cci: Fix CCI PMU event validation

We mask the event with the CCI_PMU_EVENT_MASK, before passing
the config to pmu_validate_hw_event(), which causes extra bits
to be ignored and qualifies an invalid event code as valid.

e.g,
 $ perf stat -a -C 0 -e CCI_400/config=0x1ff,name=cycles/ sleep 1
   Performance counter stats for 'system wide':

         506951142      cycles

       1.013879626 seconds time elapsed

where, cycles has an event coding of 0xff. This patch also removes
the unnecessary 'event' mask in pmu_write_register, since the config_base
is set by the pmu code after the event is validated.
