hv: vmbus_post_msg: retry the hypercall on some transient errors

I got HV_STATUS_INVALID_CONNECTION_ID on Hyper-V 2008 R2 when keeping running
"rmmod hv_netvsc; modprobe hv_netvsc; rmmod hv_utils; modprobe hv_utils"
in a Linux guest. Looks the host has some kind of throttling mechanism if
some kinds of hypercalls are sent too frequently.
Without the patch, the driver can occasionally fail to load.

Also let's retry HV_STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_MEMORY, though we didn't get it
before.

Removed 'case -ENOMEM', since the hypervisor doesn't return this.
