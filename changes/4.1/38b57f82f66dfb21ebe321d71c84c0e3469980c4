target: Add protected fabric + unprotected device support

This patch adds a new target_core_fabric_ops callback for allowing fabric
drivers to expose a TPG attribute for signaling when a T10-PI protected
fabric wants to function with an un-protected device without T10-PI.

This specifically is to allow LIO to perform WRITE_STRIP + READ_INSERT
operations when functioning with non T10-PI enabled devices, seperate
from any available hw offloads the fabric supports.

This is done using a new se_sess->sess_prot_type that is set at fabric
session creation time based upon the TPG attribute.  It currently cannot
be changed for individual sessions after initial creation.

Also, update existing target_core_sbc.c code to honor sess_prot_type when
setting up cmd->prot_op + cmd->prot_type assignments.

(Add unlikely and !! boolean conversion in sbc_check_prot - Sagi)
