dmaengine: shdma: use normal interface for passing slave id

in dma_slave_config, which is incompatible with the way that the
dmaengine API normally works.

I've had a closer look at the existing code now and found that all
slave drivers that pass a slave_id in dma_slave_config for SH do that
right after passing the same ID into shdma_chan_filter, so we can just
rely on that. However, the various shdma drivers currently do not
remember the slave ID that was passed into the filter function when
used in non-DT mode and only check the value to find a matching channel,
unlike all other drivers.

There might still be drivers that are not part of the kernel that rely
on setting the slave_id to some other value, so to be on the safe side,
this adds another 'real_slave_id' field to shdma_chan that remembers
the ID and uses it when a driver passes a zero slave_id in dma_slave_config,
like most drivers do.

Eventually, the real_slave_id and slave_id fields should just get merged
into one field, but that requires other changes.
