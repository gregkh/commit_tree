mm: move mm_populate()-related code to mm/gup.c

It's odd that we have populate_vma_page_range() and __mm_populate() in
mm/mlock.c.  It's implementation of generic memory population and mlocking
is one of possible side effect, if VM_LOCKED is set.

__get_user_pages() is core of the implementation.  Let's move the code
into mm/gup.c.
