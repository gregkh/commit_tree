KVM: s390: introduce post handlers for STSI

The Store System Information (STSI) instruction currently collects all
information it relays to the caller in the kernel. Some information,
however, is only available in user space. An example of this is the
guest name: The kernel always sets "KVMGuest", but user space knows the
actual guest name.

This patch introduces a new exit, KVM_EXIT_S390_STSI, guarded by a
capability that can be enabled by user space if it wants to be able to
insert such data. User space will be provided with the target buffer
and the requested STSI function code.
