Staging: rtl8712: Eliminate use of _cancel_timer

Use timer API function del_timer_sync instead of driver
specific function _cancel_timer as besides deactivating
a timer, it also ensures that the timer is stopped on all
CPUs before the driver exists. Also, variables
timer_cancelled and bool are removed as they are no longer
needed.
