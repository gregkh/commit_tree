perf tools: Fix the bash completion for listing subcommands of perf

The bash completion does not support listing subcommands for 'perf
--<long option> <TAB>'.

Example:

Before this patch:

 $ perf --debug <TAB>
 $

As shown above, the subcommands of perf does not come out.

After this patch:

 $ perf --debug <TAB>
 annotate       buildid-cache  data           evlist         inject
 kvm            lock           probe          report         script
 test           top            version
 bench          buildid-list   diff           help           kmem
 list           mem            record         sched          stat
 timechart      trace

As shown above, the subcommands of perf can come out now.
