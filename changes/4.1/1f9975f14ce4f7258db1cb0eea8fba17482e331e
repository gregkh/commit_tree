perf tools: Add the bash completion for listing subsubcommands of perf test

The bash completion does not support listing subsubcommands for 'perf
test <TAB>', so fix it.

Example:

Before this patch:

 $ perf test <TAB>
 $

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf test does not come out.

After this patch:

 $ perf test <TAB>
 list

As shown above, the subsubcommands of perf test can come out now.
