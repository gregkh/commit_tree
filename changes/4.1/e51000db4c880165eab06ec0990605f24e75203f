be2net: Replace dma/pci_alloc_coherent() calls with dma_zalloc_coherent()

There are several places in the driver (all in control paths) where
coherent dma memory is being allocated using either dma_alloc_coherent()
or the deprecated pci_alloc_consistent(). All these calls should be
changed to use dma_zalloc_coherent() to avoid uninitialized fields in
data structures backed by this memory.
