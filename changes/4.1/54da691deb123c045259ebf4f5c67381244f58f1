drm/i915: fix screen flickering

Commit c9f038a1a592 ("drm/i915: Don't assume primary & cursor are
always on for wm calculation (v4)") fixes a null pointer dereference.
Setting the primary and cursor panes to false in
ilk_compute_wm_parameters to false does however give the following
errors in the kernel log and causes the screen to flicker.

[  101.133716] [drm:intel_set_cpu_fifo_underrun_reporting [i915]]
*ERROR* uncleared fifo underrun on pipe A
[  101.133725] [drm:intel_cpu_fifo_underrun_irq_handler [i915]]
*ERROR* CPU pipe A FIFO underrun

Always setting the panes to enabled fixes this error.
