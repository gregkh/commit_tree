act_mirred: Fix bogus header when redirecting from VLAN

When you redirect a VLAN device to any device, you end up with
crap in af_packet on the xmit path because hard_header_len is
not equal to skb->mac_len.  So the redirected packet contains
four extra bytes at the start which then gets interpreted as
part of the MAC address.

This patch fixes this by only pushing skb->mac_len.  We also
need to fix ifb because it tries to undo the pushing done by
act_mirred.
