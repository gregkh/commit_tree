writeback: Export enums used by tracepoint to user space

The enums used in tracepoints for __print_symbolic() do not have their
values shown in the tracepoint format files and this makes it difficult
for user space tools to convert the binary values to the strings they
are to represent.

Add TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM(x) macros to export the enum names to their values
to make the tracing output from user space tools more robust.
