spi: of: do explicitly request modules for of-registered devices

Trying to register an SPI device asynchronously (via async_schedule() call)
results in an ugly complaint from request_module() warning about potential
deadlock (because request_module tries to wait for async works to
complete, the caller is also an async work in this case).

While we could try to switch to using request_module_nowait(), other buses,
as well as SPI itself when not using device tree, do not try to load
modules explicitly, but rather rely on the standard infrastructure (such as
udev) to execute module loading. There is no reason why SPI OF-described
devices should be treated differently.
