xtensa: xtfpga: fix hardware lockup caused by LCD driver

LCD driver is always built for the XTFPGA platform, but its base address
is not configurable, and is wrong for ML605/KC705. Its initialization
locks up KC705 board hardware.

Make the whole driver optional, and its base address and bus width
configurable. Implement 4-bit bus access method.
