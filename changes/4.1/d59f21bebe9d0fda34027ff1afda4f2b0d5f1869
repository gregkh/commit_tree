UBI: Fastmap: Fix races in ubi_wl_get_peb()

ubi_wl_get_peb() has two problems, it reads the pool
size and usage counters without any protection.
While reading one value would be perfectly fine it reads multiple
values and compares them. This is racy and can lead to incorrect
pool handling.
Furthermore ubi_update_fastmap() is called without wl_lock held,
before incrementing the used counter it needs to be checked again.
It could happen that another thread consumed all PEBs from the
pool and the counter goes beyond ->size.
