PM / Domains: Sync runtime PM status with genpd after probe

Buses which currently supports attaching devices to their PM domains,
will invoke the dev_pm_domain_attach() API from their ->probe()
callbacks. During the attach procedure, genpd power up the PM domain.

In those scenarios where the bus/driver don't need to access its device
during probe, it may leave it in runtime PM suspended state since
that's also the default state. In that way, no notifications through
the runtime PM callbacks will reach the PM domain during probe.

For genpd, the consequence from the above scenario means the PM domain
will remain powered. Therefore, implement the struct dev_pm_domain's
->sync() callback, which is invoked from driver core after the
bus/driver has probed the device. It allows genpd to power off the PM
domain if it's unused.
