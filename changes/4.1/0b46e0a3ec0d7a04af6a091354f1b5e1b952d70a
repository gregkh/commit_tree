s390/kvm: remove delayed reallocation of page tables for KVM

Replacing a 2K page table with a 4K page table while a VMA is active
for the affected memory region is fundamentally broken. Rip out the
page table reallocation code and replace it with a simple system
control 'vm.allocate_pgste'. If the system control is set the page
tables for all processes are allocated as full 4K pages, even for
processes that do not need it.
