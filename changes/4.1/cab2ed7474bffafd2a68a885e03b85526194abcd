ALSA: ctl: fill identical information to return value when adding userspace elements

currently some members related identical information are not fiiled
in returned parameter of SNDRV_CTL_IOCTL_ELEM_ADD. This is not better
for userspace application.

This commit copies information to returned value. When failing to copy
into userspace, the added elements are going to be removed. Then, no
applications can lock these elements between adding and removing because
these are already locked.
