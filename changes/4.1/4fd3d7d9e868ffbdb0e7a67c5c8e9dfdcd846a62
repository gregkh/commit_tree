neigh: Add helper function neigh_xmit

For MPLS I am building the code so that either the neighbour mac
address can be specified or we can have a next hop in ipv4 or ipv6.

The kind of next hop we have is indicated by the neighbour table
pointer.  A neighbour table pointer of NULL is a link layer address.
A non-NULL neighbour table pointer indicates which neighbour table and
thus which address family the next hop address is in that we need to
look up.

The code either sends a packet directly or looks up the appropriate
neighbour table entry and sends the packet.
