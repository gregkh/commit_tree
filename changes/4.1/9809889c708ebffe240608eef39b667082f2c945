serial: 8250_omap: provide complete custom startup & shutdown callbacks

The currently in-use port->startup and port->shutdown are "okay". The
startup part for instance does the tiny omap extra part and invokes
serial8250_do_startup() for the remaining pieces. The workflow in
serial8250_do_startup() is okay except for the part where UART_RX is
read without a check if there is something to read. I tried to
workaround it in commit 0aa525d11859 ("tty: serial: 8250_core: read only
RX if there is something in the FIFO") but then reverted it later in
commit ca8bb4aefb9 ("serial: 8250: Revert "tty: serial: 8250_core: read
only RX if there is something in the FIFO"").

This is the second attempt to get it to work on older OMAPs without
breaking other chips this time
Peter Hurley suggested to pull in the few needed lines from
serial8250_do_startup() and drop everything else that is not required
including making it simpler like using just request_irq() instead the
chain handler like it is doing now.
So lets try that.

Fixes: ca8bb4aefb93 ("serial: 8250: Revert "tty: serial: 8250_core:
       read only RX if there is something in the FIFO"")
