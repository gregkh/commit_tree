xfs: replace xfs_mod_incore_sb_batched

Introduce helper functions for modifying fields in the superblock
into xfs_trans.c, the only caller of xfs_mod_incore_sb_batch().  We
can then use these directly in xfs_trans_unreserve_and_mod_sb() and
so remove another user of the xfs_mode_incore_sb() API without
losing any functionality or scalability of the transaction commit
code..

Based on a patch from Christoph Hellwig.
