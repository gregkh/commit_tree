Revert "netfilter: bridge: query conntrack about skb dnat"

This reverts commit c055d5b03bb4cb69d349d787c9787c0383abd8b2.

There are two issues:
'dnat_took_place' made me think that this is related to
-j DNAT/MASQUERADE.

But thats only one part of the story.  This is also relevant for SNAT
when we undo snat translation in reverse/reply direction.

Furthermore, I originally wanted to do this mainly to avoid
storing ipv6 addresses once we make DNAT/REDIRECT work
for ipv6 on bridges.

However, I forgot about SNPT/DNPT which is stateless.

So we can't escape storing address for ipv6 anyway. Might as
well do it for ipv4 too.
