x86/signal/64: Remove 'fs' and 'gs' from sigcontext

As far as I can tell, these fields have been set to zero on save
and ignored on restore since Linux was imported into git.
Rename them '__pad1' and '__pad2' to avoid confusion.  This may
also allow us to recycle them some day.

This also adds a comment clarifying the history of those fields.

I'm intentionally avoiding calling either of them '__pad0': the
field formerly known as '__pad0' is now 'ss'.
