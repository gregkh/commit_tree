powerpc/book3s: Fix flush_tlb cpu_spec hook to take a generic argument.

The flush_tlb hook in cpu_spec was introduced as a generic function hook
to invalidate TLBs. But the current implementation of flush_tlb hook
takes IS (invalidation selector) as an argument which is architecture
dependent. Hence, It is not right to have a generic routine where caller
has to pass non-generic argument.

This patch fixes this and makes flush_tlb hook as high level API.
