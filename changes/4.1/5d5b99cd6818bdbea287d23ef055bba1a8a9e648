KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Get rid of vcore nap_count and n_woken

We can tell when a secondary thread has finished running a guest by
the fact that it clears its kvm_hstate.kvm_vcpu pointer, so there
is no real need for the nap_count field in the kvmppc_vcore struct.
This changes kvmppc_wait_for_nap to poll the kvm_hstate.kvm_vcpu
pointers of the secondary threads rather than polling vc->nap_count.
Besides reducing the size of the kvmppc_vcore struct by 8 bytes,
this also means that we can tell which secondary threads have got
stuck and thus print a more informative error message.
