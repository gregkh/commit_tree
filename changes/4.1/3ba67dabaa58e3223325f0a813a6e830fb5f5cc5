ebpf: bpf_map_*: fix linker error on avr32 and openrisc arch

Fengguang reported, that on openrisc and avr32 architectures, we
get the following linker errors on *_defconfig builds that have
no bpf syscall support:

  net/built-in.o:(.rodata+0x1cd0): undefined reference to `bpf_map_lookup_elem_proto'
  net/built-in.o:(.rodata+0x1cd4): undefined reference to `bpf_map_update_elem_proto'
  net/built-in.o:(.rodata+0x1cd8): undefined reference to `bpf_map_delete_elem_proto'

Fix it up by providing built-in weak definitions of the symbols,
so they can be overridden when the syscall is enabled. I think
the issue might be that gcc is not able to optimize all that away.
This patch fixes the linker errors for me, tested with Fengguang's
make.cross [1] script.
