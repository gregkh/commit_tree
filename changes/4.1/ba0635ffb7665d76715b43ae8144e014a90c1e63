drm/i915: cleanup some indenting

Static checkers complain that we should probably add curly braces
because, from the indenting, it looks like seq_printf() should be inside
the list_for_each_entry() loop.  But the code is actually correct, it's
just the indenting which is off.

Besides fixing the indenting on seq_printf(), I did add curly braces,
because generally mult-line indents should have curly braces to make
them more readable.

The unintended indent was left behind and not unindented in
