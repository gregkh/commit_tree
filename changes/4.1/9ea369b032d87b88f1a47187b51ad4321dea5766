KVM: x86: fix mixed APIC mode broadcast

Broadcast allowed only one global APIC mode, but mixed modes are
theoretically possible.  x2APIC IPI doesn't mean 0xff as broadcast,
the rest does.

x2APIC broadcasts are accepted by xAPIC.  If we take SDM to be logical,
even addreses beginning with 0xff should be accepted, but real hardware
disagrees.  This patch aims for simple code by considering most of real
behavior as undefined.
