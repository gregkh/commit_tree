md-cluster: re-add capabilities

When "re-add" is writted to /sys/block/mdXX/md/dev-YYY/state,
the clustered md:

1. Sends RE_ADD message with the desc_nr. Nodes receiving the message
   clear the Faulty bit in their respective rdev->flags.
2. The node initiating re-add, gathers the bitmaps of all nodes
   and copies them into the local bitmap. It does not clear the bitmap
   from which it is copying.
3. Initiating node schedules a md recovery to sync the devices.
