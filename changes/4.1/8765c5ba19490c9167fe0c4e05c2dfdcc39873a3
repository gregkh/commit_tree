ACPI / scan: Rework modalias creation when "compatible" is present

Currently, the ACPI modalias creation covers two mutually exclusive
cases: If the PRP0001 device ID is present in the device's list of
ACPI/PNP IDs and the "compatible" property is present in _DSD, the
created modalias will follow the OF rules of modalias creation.
Otherwise, ACPI rules are used.

However, that is not really desirable, because the presence of PRP0001
in the list of device IDs generally does not preclude using other
ACPI/PNP IDs with that device and those other IDs may be of higher
priority.  In those cases, the other IDs should take preference over
PRP0001 and therefore they also should be present in the modalias.

For this reason, rework the modalias creation for ACPI so that it
shows both the ACPI-style and OF-style modalias strings if the
device has a non-empty list of ACPI/PNP IDs (other than PRP0001)
and a valid "compatible" property at the same time.
