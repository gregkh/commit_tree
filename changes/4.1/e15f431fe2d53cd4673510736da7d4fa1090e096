errno.h: Improve ENOSYS's comment

ENOSYS is the mechanism used by user code to detect whether the running
kernel implements a given system call.  It should not be returned by
anything except an unimplemented system call.

Unfortunately, it is rather frequently used in the kernel to indicate that
various new functions of existing system calls are not implemented.  This
should be discouraged.

Improve the comment in errno.h to help clarify ENOSYS's purpose.
