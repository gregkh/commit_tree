clk: don't use __initconst for non-const arrays

The statement

	static const char *name[];

defines a modifiable array of pointers to constant chars. That is

	*name[0] = 'f';

is forbidden, but

	name[0] = "f";

is not. So marking an array that is defined as above with __initconst is
wrong. Either an additional const must be added such that the whole
definition reads:

	static const char *const name[] __initconst;

or where this is not possible __initdata must be used.
