ACPI / PNP: add two IDs to list for PNPACPI device enumeration

Commit eec15edbb0e1 (ACPI / PNP: use device ID list for PNPACPI device
enumeration) changed the way how ACPI devices are enumerated and when
they are added to the PNP bus.

However, it broke the sound card support on (at least) a vintage
IBM ThinkPad 600E: with said commit applied, two of the necessary
"CSC01xx" devices are not added to the PNP bus and hence can not be
found during the initialization of the "snd-cs4236" module.  As a
consequence, loading "snd-cs4236" causes null pointer exceptions.
The attached patch fixes the problem end re-enables sound on the
IBM ThinkPad 600E.
