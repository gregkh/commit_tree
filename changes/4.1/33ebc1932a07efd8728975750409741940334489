selinux: Use a better hash function for avtab

This function, based on murmurhash3, has much better distribution than
the original. Using the current default of 2048 buckets, there are many
fewer collisions:

Before:
101421 entries and 2048/2048 buckets used, longest chain length 374
After:
101421 entries and 2048/2048 buckets used, longest chain length 81

The difference becomes much more significant when buckets are increased.
A naive attempt to expand the current function to larger outputs doesn't
yield any significant improvement; so this function is a prerequisite
for increasing the bucket size.

sds:  Adapted from the original patches for libsepol to the kernel.
