RCU pathwalk breakage when running into a symlink overmounting something

Calling unlazy_walk() in walk_component() and do_last() when we find
a symlink that needs to be followed doesn't acquire a reference to vfsmount.
That's fine when the symlink is on the same vfsmount as the parent directory
(which is almost always the case), but it's not always true - one _can_
manage to bind a symlink on top of something.  And in such cases we end up
with excessive mntput().
