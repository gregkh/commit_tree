UBI: Fastmap: Rework fastmap error paths

If UBI is unable to write the fastmap to the device
we have make sure that upon next attach UBI will fall
back to scanning mode.
In case we cannot ensure that they only thing we can do
is falling back to read-only mode.

The current error handling code is not powercut proof.
It could happen that a powercut while invalidating would
lead to a state where an too old fastmap could be used upon
attach.
This patch addresses the issue by writing a fake fastmap
super block to a fresh PEB instead of reerasing the existing one.
The fake fastmap super block will UBI case to do a full scan.
