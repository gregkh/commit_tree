smack: Fix gcc warning from unused smack_syslog_lock mutex in smackfs.c

In commit 00f84f3f2e9d088f06722f4351d67f5f577abe22 ("Smack: Make the
syslog control configurable") this mutex was added, but the rest of
the final commit never actually made use of it, resulting in:

 In file included from include/linux/mutex.h:29:0,
                  from include/linux/notifier.h:13,
                  from include/linux/memory_hotplug.h:6,
                  from include/linux/mmzone.h:821,
                  from include/linux/gfp.h:5,
                  from include/linux/slab.h:14,
                  from include/linux/security.h:27,
                  from security/smack/smackfs.c:21:
 security/smack/smackfs.c:63:21: warning: ‘smack_syslog_lock’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
  static DEFINE_MUTEX(smack_syslog_lock);
                      ^

A git grep shows no other instances/references to smack_syslog_lock.
Delete it, assuming that the mutex addition was just a leftover from
an earlier work in progress version of the change.
