ALSA: usb-audio: Don't attempt to get Microsoft Lifecam Cinema sample rate

Adds Microsoft LifeCam Cinema USB ID to the snd_usb_get_sample_rate_quirk list as the Lifecam Cinema does not appear to support getting the sample rate.

Fixes the issue where the LifeCam Cinema would wait for USB timeout and log the message "cannot get freq at ep 0x82" when accessed.
