usb: renesas_usbhs: Fix fifo unclear in usbhsf_prepare_pop

This patch fixes an issue for control write. When usbhsf_prepare_pop()
is called after this driver called a gadget setup function, this controller
doesn't receive the control write data. So, this patch adds a code to clear
the fifo for control write in usbhsf_prepare_pop().
