KVM: x86: use MDA for interrupt matching

In mixed modes, we musn't deliver xAPIC IPIs like x2APIC and vice versa.
Instead of preserving the information in apic_send_ipi(), we regain it
by converting all destinations into correct MDA in the slow path.
This allows easier reasoning about subsequent matching.

Our kvm_apic_broadcast() had an interesting design decision: it didn't
consider IOxAPIC 0xff as broadcast in x2APIC mode ...
everything worked because IOxAPIC can't set that in physical mode and
logical mode considered it as a message for first 8 VCPUs.
This patch interprets IOxAPIC 0xff as x2APIC broadcast.
