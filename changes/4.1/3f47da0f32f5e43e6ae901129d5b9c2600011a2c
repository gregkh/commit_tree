rcu_tree: Avoid touching rnp->completed when a new GP is started

In rcu_gp_init(), rnp->completed equals to rsp->completed in THEORY,
we don't need to touch it normally.  If something goes wrong,
it will complain and fixup rnp->completed and avoid oops.
This commit thus avoids the normal needless store to rnp->completed.
