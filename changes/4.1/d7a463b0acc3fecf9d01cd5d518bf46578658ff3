target/sbc: Make internal DIF emulation honor ->prot_checks

The internal DIF emulation was not honoring se_cmd->prot_checks for
the WRPROTECT/RDPROTECT == 0x3 case, so sbc_dif_v1_verify() has been
updated to follow which checks have been calculated based on
WRPROTECT/RDPROTECT in sbc_set_prot_op_checks().
