MIPS: Correct FP ISA requirements

Correct ISA requirements for floating-point instructions:

* the CU3 exception signifies a real COP3 instruction in MIPS I & II,

* the BC1FL and BC1TL instructions are not supported in MIPS I,

* the SQRT.fmt instructions are indeed supported in MIPS II,

* the LDC1 and SDC1 instructions are indeed supported in MIPS32r1,

* the CEIL.W.fmt, FLOOR.W.fmt, ROUND.W.fmt and TRUNC.W.fmt instructions
  are indeed supported in MIPS32,

* the CVT.L.fmt and CVT.fmt.L instructions are indeed supported in
  MIPS32r2 and MIPS32r6,

* the CEIL.L.fmt, FLOOR.L.fmt, ROUND.L.fmt and TRUNC.L.fmt instructions
  are indeed supported in MIPS32r2 and MIPS32r6,

* the RSQRT.fmt and RECIP.fmt instructions are indeed supported in
  MIPS64r1,

Also simplify conditionals for MIPS III and MIPS IV FPU instructions and
the handling of the MOVCI minor opcode.
