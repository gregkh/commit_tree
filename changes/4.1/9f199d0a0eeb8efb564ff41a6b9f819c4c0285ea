KVM: arm/arm64: simplify vgic_find_range() and callers

The vgic_find_range() function in vgic.c takes a struct kvm_exit_mmio
argument, but actually only used the length field in there. Since we
need to get rid of that structure in that part of the code anyway,
let's rework the function (and it's callers) to pass the length
argument to the function directly.
