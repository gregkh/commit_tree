powerpc/powernv: Fix early pci_controller_ops loading.

Load the PowerNV platform pci controller ops into pci controllers
after all the operations are loaded into the platform ops struct, not
before.

Otherwise we aren't actually setting the ops properly which can break
IO for some devices.

Fixes: 65ebf4b63 ("powerpc/powernv: Move controller ops from ppc_md to controller_ops")
