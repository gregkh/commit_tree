Use separate bitmaps for each nodes in the cluster

On-disk format:

0                    4k                     8k                    12k
-------------------------------------------------------------------
| idle                | md super            | bm super [0] + bits |
| bm bits[0, contd]   | bm super[1] + bits  | bm bits[1, contd]   |
| bm super[2] + bits  | bm bits [2, contd]  | bm super[3] + bits  |
| bm bits [3, contd]  |                     |                     |

Bitmap super has a field nodes, which defines the maximum number
of nodes the device can use. While reading the bitmap super, if
the cluster finds out that the number of nodes is > 0:
1. Requests the md-cluster module.
2. Calls md_cluster_ops->join(), which sets up clustering such as
   joining DLM lockspace.

Since the first time, the first bitmap is read. After the call
to the cluster_setup, the bitmap offset is adjusted and the
superblock is re-read. This also ensures the bitmap is read
the bitmap lock (when bitmap lock is introduced in later patches)

Questions:
1. cluster name is repeated in all bitmap supers. Is that okay?
