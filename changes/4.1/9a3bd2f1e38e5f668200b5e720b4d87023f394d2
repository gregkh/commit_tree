i40e: Enable more than 64 qps for the Main VSI

When running in a single TC mode the HW can be configured to enable more
than max RSS qps for the Main VSI. This  patch makes it possible to
enable as many as num_online_cpus().

ethtool -L can still be used to reconfigure number of qps
to a smaller value.
