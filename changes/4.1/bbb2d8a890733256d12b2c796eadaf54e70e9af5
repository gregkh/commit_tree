HID: Kconfig: add USB_HID dependency to UC-LOGIC

In commit 08177f4 (HID: uclogic: merge hid-huion driver in hid-uclogic)
HID_HUION depends explicitely on USB_HID because it contained quite some
USB-isms.

Now that hid-uclogic is the new home of Huion tablets, we need to also
add the dependency on USB_HID to this driver.
