Input: synaptics - allocate 3 slots to keep stability in image sensors

When slowly dropping 1, 2 and then 3 fingers on an image sensor touchpad,
we can see that the first finger gets reassigned a new slot while it did
not move. This is due to the kernel tracking algorithm which can not assign
correctly the 3 touches, being out of slots.

Declaring that we support 3 slots allows to actually forward:
slot 0 -> down, slot 1 -> up, slot 2 -> down
