modpost: don't emit section mismatch warnings for compiler optimizations

Currently an allyesconfig build [gcc-4.9.1] can generate the following:

   WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text.unlikely+0x3864): Section mismatch in
   reference from the function cpumask_empty.constprop.3() to the
   variable .init.data:nmi_ipi_mask

which comes from the cpumask_empty usage in arch/x86/kernel/nmi_selftest.c.

Normally we would not see a symbol entry for cpumask_empty since it is:

	static inline bool cpumask_empty(const struct cpumask *srcp)

however in this case, the variant of the symbol gets emitted when GCC does
constant propagation optimization.

Fix things up so that any locally optimized constprop variants don't warn
when accessing variables that live in the __init sections.
