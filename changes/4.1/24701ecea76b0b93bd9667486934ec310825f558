ebpf: move read-only fields to bpf_prog and shrink bpf_prog_aux

is_gpl_compatible and prog_type should be moved directly into bpf_prog
as they stay immutable during bpf_prog's lifetime, are core attributes
and they can be locked as read-only later on via bpf_prog_select_runtime().

With a bit of rearranging, this also allows us to shrink bpf_prog_aux
to exactly 1 cacheline.
