smp: don't use 16-bit words for atomic accesses

Yes, it should work, but it's a bad idea.  Not only did ARM64 not have
the 16-bit access code (there's a separate patch to add it), it's just
not a good atomic type.  Some architectures fundamentally don't do
atomic accesses in them (alpha), and it's not like it saves any space
here anyway because of structure packing issues.

We normally should aim for flags to be "unsigned int" or "unsigned
long".  And if space is at a premium, use a single byte (although that
causes problems on alpha again).  There might be very special cases
where a 16-byte entity is really wanted, but this is not one of them.
