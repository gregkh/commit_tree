page_writeback: clean up mess around cancel_dirty_page()

This patch replaces cancel_dirty_page() with a helper function
account_page_cleaned() which only updates counters.  It's called from
truncate_complete_page() and from try_to_free_buffers() (hack for ext3).
Page is locked in both cases, page-lock protects against concurrent
dirtiers: see commit 2d6d7f982846 ("mm: protect set_page_dirty() from
ongoing truncation").

Delete_from_page_cache() shouldn't be called for dirty pages, they must
be handled by caller (either written or truncated).  This patch treats
final dirty accounting fixup at the end of __delete_from_page_cache() as
a debug check and adds WARN_ON_ONCE() around it.  If something removes
dirty pages without proper handling that might be a bug and unwritten
data might be lost.

Hugetlbfs has no dirty pages accounting, ClearPageDirty() is enough
here.

cancel_dirty_page() in nfs_wb_page_cancel() is redundant.  This is
helper for nfs_invalidate_page() and it's called only in case complete
invalidation.

The mess was started in v2.6.20 after commits 46d2277c796f ("Clean up
and make try_to_free_buffers() not race with dirty pages") and
3e67c0987d75 ("truncate: clear page dirtiness before running
try_to_free_buffers()") first was reverted right in v2.6.20 in commit
ecdfc9787fe5 ("Resurrect 'try_to_free_buffers()' VM hackery"), second in
v2.6.25 commit a2b345642f53 ("Fix dirty page accounting leak with ext3
data=journal").

Custom fixes were introduced between these points.  NFS in v2.6.23, commit
1b3b4a1a2deb ("NFS: Fix a write request leak in nfs_invalidate_page()").
Kludge in __delete_from_page_cache() in v2.6.24, commit 3a6927906f1b ("Do
dirty page accounting when removing a page from the page cache").  Since
v2.6.25 all of them are redundant.
