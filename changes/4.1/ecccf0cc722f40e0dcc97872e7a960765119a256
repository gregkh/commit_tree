arm/arm64: KVM: export VCPU power state via MP_STATE ioctl

To cleanly restore an SMP VM we need to ensure that the current pause
state of each vcpu is correctly recorded. Things could get confused if
the CPU starts running after migration restore completes when it was
paused before it state was captured.

We use the existing KVM_GET/SET_MP_STATE ioctl to do this. The arm/arm64
interface is a lot simpler as the only valid states are
KVM_MP_STATE_RUNNABLE and KVM_MP_STATE_STOPPED.
