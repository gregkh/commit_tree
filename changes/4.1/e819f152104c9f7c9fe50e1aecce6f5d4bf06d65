mnt: Improve the umount_tree flags

- Remove the unneeded declaration from pnode.h
- Mark umount_tree static as it has no callers outside of namespace.c
- Define an enumeration of umount_tree's flags.
- Pass umount_tree's flags in by name

This removes the magic numbers 0, 1 and 2 making the code a little
clearer and makes it possible for there to be lazy unmounts that don't
propagate.  Which is what __detach_mounts actually wants for example.
