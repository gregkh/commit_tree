fm10k: use hw->mac.max_queues for stats

Even though it shouldn't strictly matter, don't count queue stats higher
than the max_queues value stored for this mac. This ensures that we
don't attempt to check queues which don't belong to use in VFs. This
shouldn't be a visible change, as the VFs should see zero for queues
which don't belong to them.
