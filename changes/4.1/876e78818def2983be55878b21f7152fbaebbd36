time: Rename timekeeper::tkr to timekeeper::tkr_mono

In preparation of adding another tkr field, rename this one to
tkr_mono. Also rename tk_read_base::base_mono to tk_read_base::base,
since the structure is not specific to CLOCK_MONOTONIC and the mono
name got added to the tk_read_base instance.

Lots of trivial churn.
