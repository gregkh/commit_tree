ARM: mvebu: Disable CPU Idle on Armada 38x

On Armada 38x SoCs, under heavy I/O load, the system hangs when CPU
Idle is enabled. Waiting for a solution to this issue, this patch
disables the CPU Idle support for this SoC.

As CPU Hot plug support also uses some of the CPU Idle functions it is
also affected by the same issue. This patch disables it also for the
Armada 38x SoCs.
