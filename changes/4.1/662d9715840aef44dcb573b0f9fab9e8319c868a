arm/arm64: KVM: Kill CONFIG_KVM_ARM_{VGIC,TIMER}

We can definitely decide at run-time whether to use the GIC and timers
or not, and the extra code and data structures that we allocate space
for is really negligable with this config option, so I don't think it's
worth the extra complexity of always having to define stub static
inlines.  The !CONFIG_KVM_ARM_VGIC/TIMER case is pretty much an untested
code path anyway, so we're better off just getting rid of it.
