mm: cma: debugfs interface

I've noticed that there is no interfaces exposed by CMA which would let me
fuzz what's going on in there.

This small patchset exposes some information out to userspace, plus adds
the ability to trigger allocation and freeing from userspace.

This patch (of 3):

Implement a simple debugfs interface to expose information about CMA areas
in the system.

Useful for testing/sanity checks for CMA since it was impossible to
previously retrieve this information in userspace.
