ACPICA: Utilities: Cleanup to convert physical address printing formats.

ACPICA commit 7f06739db43a85083a70371c14141008f20b2198

For physical addresses, since the address may exceed 32-bit address range
after calculation, we should use %8.8X%8.8X (see ACPI_FORMAT_UINT64()) to
convert the %p formats.

This is a preparation to switch acpi_physical_address to 64-bit on 32-bit
kernel builds.
