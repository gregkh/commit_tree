dm verity: add error handling modes for corrupted blocks

Add device specific modes to dm-verity to specify how corrupted
blocks should be handled.  The following modes are defined:

  - DM_VERITY_MODE_EIO is the default behavior, where reading a
    corrupted block results in -EIO.

  - DM_VERITY_MODE_LOGGING only logs corrupted blocks, but does
    not block the read.

  - DM_VERITY_MODE_RESTART calls kernel_restart when a corrupted
    block is discovered.

In addition, each mode sends a uevent to notify userspace of
corruption and to allow further recovery actions.

The driver defaults to previous behavior (DM_VERITY_MODE_EIO)
and other modes can be enabled with an additional parameter to
the verity table.
