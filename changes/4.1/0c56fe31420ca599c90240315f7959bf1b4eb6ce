mnt: Don't propagate unmounts to locked mounts

If the first mount in shared subtree is locked don't unmount the
shared subtree.

This is ensured by walking through the mounts parents before children
and marking a mount as unmountable if it is not locked or it is locked
but it's parent is marked.

This allows recursive mount detach to propagate through a set of
mounts when unmounting them would not reveal what is under any locked
mount.
