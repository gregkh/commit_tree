ARM: 8322/1: keep .text and .fixup regions closer together

This moves all fixup snippets to the .text.fixup section, which is
a special section that gets emitted along with the .text section
for each input object file, i.e., the snippets are kept much closer
to the code they refer to, which helps prevent linker failure on
large kernels.
