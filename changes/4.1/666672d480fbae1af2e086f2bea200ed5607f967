net/mlx4: Allocate VPPs for each port on PF init

Initialization of granular Qos per VF mechanism.

Query the port availible VPPs and allocates those on all supported
priorities in an equal share. Allocation is done only in SRIOV mode,
when the feature is supported by the device and port type is Ethernet.

Allocation currently is done only on the default priority 0.
