serial: 8250: Separate legacy irq handling from core port operations

Prepare for 8250 split; decouple irq setup/teardown and handler from
core port operations.

Introduce setup_irq() and release_irq() 8250 driver methods; the 8250
core will use these methods to install and remove irq handling for
the given 8250 port.

Refactor irq chain linking/unlinking from 8250 core into
univ8250_setup_irq()/univ8250_release_irq() for the universal 8250 driver.
