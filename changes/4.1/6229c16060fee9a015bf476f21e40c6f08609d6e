hwrng: bcm63xx - make use of devm_hwrng_register

This change converts bcm63xx-rng to use devm* API for managing all
resources, which allows us to dispense with the rest of error handling
path and remove() function. Also we combine hwern and driver-private
data into a single allocation, use clk_prepare_enable() instead
of "naked" clk_enable() and move clock enabling/disabling into hwrnd
inti(0 and cleanup() methods so the clock stays off until rng is
used.
