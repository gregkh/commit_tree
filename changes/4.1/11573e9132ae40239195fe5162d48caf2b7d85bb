PM / devfreq: tegra: Update to v5 of the submitted patches

There seemed to be some miscommunication and an old version of the
submitted patches was merged.

This commit updates the driver to v5, which had this changelog:

* Clarify the units of avg_dependency_threshold
* Remove unused references to platform_device
* Enable and disable interrupts on governor events
* Make sure we handle all interrupts for any of the devices we are sampling
* Move locking to be per-actmon-device
