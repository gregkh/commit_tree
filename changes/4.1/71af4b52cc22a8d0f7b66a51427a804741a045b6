platform/chrome: Create sysfs attributes for the ChromeOS EC

This adds the first few sysfs attributes for the Chrome OS EC. These
controls are made available under /sys/devices/virtual/chromeos/cros_ec

    flashinfo   - display current flash info
    reboot      - tell the EC to reboot in various ways
    version     - information about the EC software and hardware

Future changes will build on this to add additional controls.

From a root shell, you should be able to do things like this:

    cd /sys/devices/virtual/chromeos/cros_ec
    cat flashinfo
    cat version
    echo rw > reboot
    cat version
    echo ro > reboot
    cat version
    echo rw > reboot
    cat version
    echo cold > reboot

That last command will reboot the AP too.
