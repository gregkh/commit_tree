ARM: shmobile: kzm9g-reference dts: Add adxl345 accelerometer node

Add a DT node for the ADXL345 three-axis digital accelerometer sensor,
which is connected to i2c0.

As trivial i2c devices are matched against the first compatible entry
only, compatibility is declared with "adi,adxl34x" only for now.

The device needs an interrupt to operate properly. Specify the two
interrupts used on the board.

While at it rename the DT node to accelerometer@1d to describe the
device's function instead of its model.
