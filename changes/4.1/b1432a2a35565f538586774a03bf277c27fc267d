ocfs2: dlm: fix race between purge and get lock resource

There is a race window in dlm_get_lock_resource(), which may return a
lock resource which has been purged.  This will cause the process to
hang forever in dlmlock() as the ast msg can't be handled due to its
lock resource not existing.

    dlm_get_lock_resource {
        ...
        spin_lock(&dlm->spinlock);
        tmpres = __dlm_lookup_lockres_full(dlm, lockid, namelen, hash);
        if (tmpres) {
             spin_unlock(&dlm->spinlock);
             >>>>>>>> race window, dlm_run_purge_list() may run and purge
                              the lock resource
             spin_lock(&tmpres->spinlock);
             ...
             spin_unlock(&tmpres->spinlock);
        }
    }
