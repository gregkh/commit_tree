ARM: dts: OMAP3-N900: Add microphone bias voltages

N900 audio recording needs that codec provides bias voltage for integrated
digital microphone and headset microphone depending which one is used.
Digital microphone uses 2 V bias and it comes from the codec A part. Codec
B part drives the headset microphone bias and that is set to 2.5 V.
