ALSA: usb-audio: Fix audio output on Roland SC-D70 sound module

Roland SC-D70 reports its device class as vendor specific class and
the quirk QUIRK_AUDIO_FIXED_ENDPOINT was used for audio output.

In the quirks table the sampling rate was hard-coded to 44100 Hz
and therefore not worked when the sound module was in 48000 Hz mode.

In this change the quirk is changed to QUIRK_AUDIO_STANDARD_INTERFACE
but as the sound module reports incorrect bSubframeSize in its
descriptors, additional change is made in format.c to detect it and
to override it (which uses the existing code for Edirol SD-90).

Tested both when the sound module was in 44100 Hz mode and 48000 Hz
mode and both audio input and output. MIDI related part of the driver
is not touched.
