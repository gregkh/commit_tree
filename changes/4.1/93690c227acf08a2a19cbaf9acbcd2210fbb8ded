Bluetooth: Introduce controller setting information for static address

Currently it is not possible to determine if the static address is used
by the controller. It is also not possible to determine if using a
static on a dual-mode controller with disabled BR/EDR is possible or
not.

To address this issue, introduce a new setting called static-address. If
support for this setting is signaled that means that the kernel supports
using static addresses. And if used on dual-mode controllers with BR/EDR
disabled it means that a configured static address can be used.

In addition utilize the same setting for the list of current active
settings that indicates if a static address is configured and if that
address will be actually used.

With this in mind the existing Set Static Address management command
has been extended to return the current settings. That way the caller
of that command can easily determine if the programmed address will
be used or if extra steps are required.
