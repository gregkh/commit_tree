ALSA: hda - Fix lost sound due to stream_pm ops cleanup

The commit [49fb18972581: ALSA: hda - Set stream_pm ops automatically
by generic parser] resulted in regressions on some Realtek and VIA
codecs because these drivers set patch_ops after calling the generic
parser, thus stream_pm got cleared to NULL again.  I haven't noticed
since I tested with IDT codec.

Restore (partial revert) the stream_pm ops for them to fix the
regression.
