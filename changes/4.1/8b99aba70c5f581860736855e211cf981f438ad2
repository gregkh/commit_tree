ALSA: hda - Fix audio crackles on Dell Latitude E7x40

We still got a report that the audio crackles and noises occur with
the recent 4.1 kernels on Dell machines.  These machines seem to need
similar workarounds that have been applied to the recent Dell XPS 13
models.  Since the codec of these machines (Dell Latitute E7240 and
E7440) is different from XPS 13's one, we need a new fixup entry.

Also, it was confirmed that the previous workaround to disable the
widget power-save (commit [219f47e4f964: ALSA: hda - Disable widget
power-saving for ALC292 & co]) is no longer needed after this fix.
So, this patch includes the partial revert of the commit, too.
