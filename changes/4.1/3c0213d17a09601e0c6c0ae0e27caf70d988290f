Input: elantech - fix semi-mt protocol for v3 HW

When the v3 hardware sees more than one finger, it uses the semi-mt
protocol to report the touches. However, it currently works when
num_fingers is 0, 1 or 2, but when it is 3 and above, it sends only 1
finger as if num_fingers was 1.

This confuses userspace which knows how to deal with extra fingers
when all the slots are used, but not when some are missing.
