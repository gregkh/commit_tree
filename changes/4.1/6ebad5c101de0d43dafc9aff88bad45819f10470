    perf trace: Handle multiple threads better wrt syscalls being intermixed

Introduced a bug where it considered the number of bytes output directly
to the output file when formatting the syscall entry buffer that is
stored to be finally printed at syscall exit, ending up leaving garbage
at the start of syscalls that appeared while another syscall was being
processed, in another thread. Fix it.

Example of garbage in the output before this patch:
