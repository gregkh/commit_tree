fib_trie: Add key vector to root, return parent key_vector in resize

This change makes it so that the root of the trie contains a key_vector, by
doing this we make room to essentially collapse the entire trie by at least
one cache line as we can store the information about the tnode or leaf that
is pointed to in the root.
