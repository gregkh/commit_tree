KVM: Fix WARNINGs for 'sizeof(X)' instead of 'sizeof X' in kvm_main.c

There are many WARNINGs like this:
WARNING: sizeof tr should be sizeof(tr)
+	if (copy_from_user(&tr, argp, sizeof tr))

In kvm_main.c many places are using 'sizeof(X)', and the other places
are using 'sizeof X', while the kernel recommands to use 'sizeof(X)',
so this patch will replace all 'sizeof X' to 'sizeof(X)' to make them
consistent and at the same time to reduce the WARNINGs noise when we
are checking new patches.
