VFS: Combine inode checks with d_is_negative() and d_is_positive() in pathwalk

Where we have:

    	if (!dentry->d_inode || d_is_negative(dentry)) {

type constructions in pathwalk we should be able to eliminate the check of
d_inode and rely solely on the result of d_is_negative() or d_is_positive().

What we do have to take care to do is to read d_inode after calling a
d_is_xxx() typecheck function to get the barriering right.
