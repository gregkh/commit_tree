ar5523: use container_of

If we want to shrink skb->cb then we'd have to see about
reducing struct ieee80211_tx_info, which gets embedded inside
skb->cb[].

It provides a scratch space to be used by wireless drivers.
ar5523 uses the maximum space available today (40 bytes), but it seems
we don't need this -- data->skb pointer seems to always point back to the
skb whose cb buffer the data structure resides, iow, given a pointer to the
embedded control buffer we can infer the skb address.
