irqchip: renesas-irqc: Add wake-up support

The IRQC module clock is managed through Runtime PM and PM Domains.
If wake-up is enabled, this clock must not be disabled during system
suspend.

Hence implement irq_chip.irq_set_wake(), which increments/decrements the
clock's enable_count when needed.

This fixes wake-up by gpio-keys on r8a73a4/ape6evm.
