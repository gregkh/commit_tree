tools lib traceevent: Add pevent_data_pid_from_comm()

There is a pevent_data_comm_from_pid() that returns the cmdline stored for
a given pid in order for users to map pids to comms, but there's no method
to convert a comm back to a pid. This is useful for filters that specify
a comm instead of a PID (it's faster than searching each individual event).

Add a way to retrieve a comm from a pid. Since there can be more than one
pid associated to a comm, it returns a data structure that lets the user
iterate over all the saved comms for a given pid.
