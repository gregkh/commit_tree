ARM: tegra: Import latest Jetson TK1 pinmux

syseng has revamped the Jetson TK1 pinmux spreadsheet, basing the content
completely on correct configuration for the board/schematic, rather than
the previous version which was based on the bare minimum changes relative
to another reference board.

This content comes from Jetson_TK1_customer_pinmux.xlsm (v09) downloaded
from https://developer.nvidia.com/hardware-design-and-development.
