x86/cacheinfo: Move cacheinfo sysfs code to generic infrastructure

This patch removes the redundant sysfs cacheinfo code by reusing
the newly introduced generic cacheinfo infrastructure through the
commit

  246246cbde5e ("drivers: base: support cpu cache information
		 interface to userspace via sysfs")

The private pointer provided by the cacheinfo is used to implement
the AMD L3 cache-specific attributes.

Note that with v4.0-rc1, commit

  513e3d2d11c9 ("cpumask: always use nr_cpu_ids in formatting and parsing
		 functions")

in particular changes from long format to shorter one for all cpumasks
sysfs entries. As the consequence of the same, even the shared_cpu_map
in the cacheinfo sysfs was also changed.

This patch neither alters any existing sysfs entries nor their
formating, however since the generic cacheinfo has switched to use the
device attributes instead of the traditional raw kobjects, a directory
named "power" along with its standard attributes are added similar to
any other device.
