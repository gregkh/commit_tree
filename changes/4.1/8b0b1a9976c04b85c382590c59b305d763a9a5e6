ACPICA: iASL/Disassembler: Add option to assume table contains valid AML.

ACPICA commit f5d2ff3fa05341d9fe27250fcb2e14c7f871432c

For dynamically loaded tables that have unknown ACPI signatures,
this option (-df) forces the disassembler to treat the table as if
it contains valid AML code (like a DSDT or SSDT). Otherwise, the
disassembler will treat the table as an unkown data table and
simply do a hex dump of the table.

Linux kernel is not affected by this patch.
