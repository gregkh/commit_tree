MIPS: clear MSACSR cause bits when handling MSA FP exception

Much like for traditional scalar FP exceptions, the cause bits in the
MSACSR register need to be cleared following an MSA FP exception.
Without doing so the exception will simply be raised again whenever
the kernel restores MSACSR from a tasks saved context, leading to
undesirable spurious exceptions. Clear the cause bits from the
handle_msa_fpe function, mirroring the way handle_fpe clears the
cause bits in FCSR.
