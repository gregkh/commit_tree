Revert "perf probe: Fix to fall back to find probe point in symbols"

This reverts commit 906451b98b67 ("perf probe: Fix to fall back to find probe point in symbols").

Since 'perf probe' now retries with the address of given symbol searched from
map before this path, this fall back routine isn't needed anymore.
