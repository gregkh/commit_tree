staging: android: ion: fix some format strings

C99 says that a precision which is simply '.' with no following digits
or * should be interpreted as 0, which means that these format strings
actually mean 'print 16 spaces'. However, the kernel's printf
implementation treats this case as if the precision was omitted. Don't
rely on that quirk.
