KVM: x86: fix lapic.timer_mode on restore

lapic.timer_mode was not properly initialized after migration, which
broke few useful things, like login, by making every sleep eternal.

Fix this by calling apic_update_lvtt in kvm_apic_post_state_restore.

There are other slowpaths that update lvtt, so this patch makes sure
something similar doesn't happen again by calling apic_update_lvtt
after every modification.
