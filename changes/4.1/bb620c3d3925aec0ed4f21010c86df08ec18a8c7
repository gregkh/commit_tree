sparc: Make sparc64 use scalable lib/iommu-common.c functions

In iperf experiments running linux as the Tx side (TCP client) with
10 threads results in a severe performance drop when TSO is disabled,
indicating a weakness in the software that can be avoided by using
the scalable IOMMU arena DMA allocation.

Baseline numbers before this patch:
   with default settings (TSO enabled) :    9-9.5 Gbps
   Disable TSO using ethtool- drops badly:  2-3 Gbps.

After this patch, iperf client with 10 threads, can give a
throughput of at least 8.5 Gbps, even when TSO is disabled.
