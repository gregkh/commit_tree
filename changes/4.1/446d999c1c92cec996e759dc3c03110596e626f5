PM / domains: factor out code to get the generic PM domain from a struct device

The PM domain code contains two methods to get the generic PM domain
for a struct device.  One is dev_to_genpd() which is only safe when
we know for certain that the device has a generic PM domain attached.
The other is coded into genpd_dev_pm_detach() which ensures that the
PM domain in the struct device is a generic PM domain (and so is safer).

This commit factors out the safer version, documents it, and hides the
unsafe dev_to_genpd().
