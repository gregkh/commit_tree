[media] media: au0828: drop vbi_buffer_filled() and re-use buffer_filled()

The vbi_buffer_filled() and buffer_filled() did the same functionality
except for incrementing the buffer sequence, this patch drops the
vbi_buffer_filled() and re-uses buffer_filled() for vbi buffers
as well by adding the check for vb2-queue type while incrementing
the sequence numbers. Along side this patch aligns the input parameters
of buffer_filled() function appropriately.
