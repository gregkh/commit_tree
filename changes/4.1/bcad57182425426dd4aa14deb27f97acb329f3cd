ebpf: add skb->priority to offset map for usage in {cls, act}_bpf

This adds the ability to read out the skb->priority from an eBPF
program, so that it can be taken into account from a tc filter
or action for the use-case where the priority is not being used
to directly override the filter classification in a qdisc, but
to tag traffic otherwise for the classifier; the priority can be
assigned from various places incl. user space, in future we may
also mangle it from an eBPF program.
