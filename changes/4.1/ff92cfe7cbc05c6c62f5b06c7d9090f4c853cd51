ACPI / video: Allow forcing native backlight on non win8 machines

The native backlight behavior (so not registering both the acpi-video
and the vendor backlight driver) can be useful on some non win8 machines
too, so change the behavior of the video.use_native_backlight=1 or 0
kernel cmdline option to be: if user has set video.use_native_backlight=1
or 0, use that no matter if it is a win8 system or not. Also, we will
put some known systems into the DMI table to make them either use native
backlight interface or not, and the use_native_backlight_dmi is used to
reflect that.
