hugetlbfs: accept subpool min_size mount option and setup accordingly

Make 'min_size=<value>' be an option when mounting a hugetlbfs.  This
option takes the same value as the 'size' option.  min_size can be
specified without specifying size.  If both are specified, min_size must
be less that or equal to size else the mount will fail.  If min_size is
specified, then at mount time an attempt is made to reserve min_size
pages.  If the reservation fails, the mount fails.  At umount time, the
reserved pages are released.
