usb: gadget: atmel_usba_udc: Add suspend/resume with wakeup support

This patch add suspend/resume with wakeup support for Atmel USBA.

On suspend: We stay continuously clocked if Vbus signal is not
available. If Vbus signal is available we set the Vbus signal as a wake
up source then we stop the USBA itself and all clocks used by USBA.

On resume: We recover clocks and USBA if we stopped them. If a device is
currently connected at resume time we enable the controller.
