[media] rtl2832: remove compiler warning

Cleaning up the following compiler warning:
rtl2832.c:703:12: warning: 'tmp' may be used uninitialized in this function

Even though it could never happen since if rtl2832_rd_demod_reg () doesn't set
tmp, this line would never run because we go to err. It is still nice to avoid
compiler warnings.
