cdc-acm: prevent infinite loop when parsing CDC headers.

Phil and I found out a problem with commit:

  7e860a6e7aa6 ("cdc-acm: add sanity checks")

It added some sanity checks to ignore potential garbage in CDC headers but
also introduced a potential infinite loop.  This can happen at the first
loop iteration (elength = 0 in that case) if the description isn't a
DT_CS_INTERFACE or later if 'buffer[0]' is zero.

It should also be noted that the wrong length was being added to 'buffer'
in case 'buffer[1]' was not a DT_CS_INTERFACE descriptor, since elength was
assigned after that check in the loop.

A specially crafted USB device could be used to trigger this infinite loop.
