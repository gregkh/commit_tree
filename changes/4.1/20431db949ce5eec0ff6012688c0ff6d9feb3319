ARM: dts: am4372: Add "ti,am437x-ocp2scp" as compatible string for OCP2SCP

Added a new compatible string "ti,am437x-ocp2scp" for OCP2SCP module.
This is needed since except for the OCP2SCP used in AM437x, SYNC2 value
in OCP2SCP TIMING should be changed whereas the default value is sufficient
in AM437x.
