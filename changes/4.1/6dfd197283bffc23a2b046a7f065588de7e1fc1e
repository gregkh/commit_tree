drm/radeon: fix freeze for laptop with Turks/Thames GPU.

Laptop with Turks/Thames GPU will freeze if dpm is enabled. It seems
the SMC engine is relying on some state inside the CP engine. CP needs
to chew at least one packet for it to get in good state for dynamic
power management.

This patch simply disabled and re-enable DPM after the ring test which
is enough to avoid the freeze.
