Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix a bug in rescind processing in vmbus_close_internal()

When a channel has been rescinded, the close operation is a noop.
Restructure the code so we deal with the rescind condition after
we properly cleanup the channel. I would like to thank
Dexuan Cui <decui@microsoft.com> for observing this problem.
The current code leaks memory when the channel is rescinded.

The current char-next branch is broken and this patch fixes
the bug.
