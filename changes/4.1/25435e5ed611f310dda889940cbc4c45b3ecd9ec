gfs2: allow quota_check and inplace_reserve to return available blocks

struct gfs2_alloc_parms is passed to gfs2_quota_check() and
gfs2_inplace_reserve() with ap->target containing the number of
blocks being requested for allocation in the current operation.

We add a new field to struct gfs2_alloc_parms called 'allowed'.
gfs2_quota_check() and gfs2_inplace_reserve() return the max
blocks allowed by quota and the max blocks allowed by the chosen
rgrp respectively in 'allowed'.

A new field 'min_target', when non-zero, tells gfs2_quota_check()
and gfs2_inplace_reserve() to not return -EDQUOT/-ENOSPC when
there are atleast 'min_target' blocks allowable/available. The
assumption is that the caller is ok with just 'min_target' blocks
and will likely proceed with allocating them.
