dm: run queue on re-queue

Without kicking queue, requeued request may stay forever in
the queue if there are no other I/O activities to the device.

The original error had been in v2.6.39 with commit 7eaceaccab5f
("block: remove per-queue plugging"), which replaced conditional
plugging by periodic runqueue.

Commit 9d1deb83d489 in v4.1-rc1 removed the periodic runqueue
and the problem started to manifest.

Fixes: 9d1deb83d489 ("dm: don't schedule delayed run of the queue if nothing to do")
