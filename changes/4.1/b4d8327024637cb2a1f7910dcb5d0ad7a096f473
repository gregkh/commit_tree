x86/traps: Enable DEBUG_STACK after cpu_init() for TRAP_DB/BP

Before this patch early_trap_init() installs DEBUG_STACK for
X86_TRAP_BP and X86_TRAP_DB. However, DEBUG_STACK doesn't work
correctly until cpu_init() <-- trap_init().

This patch passes 0 to set_intr_gate_ist() and
set_system_intr_gate_ist() instead of DEBUG_STACK to let it use
same stack as kernel, and installs DEBUG_STACK for them in
trap_init().

As core runs at ring 0 between early_trap_init() and
trap_init(), there is no chance to get a bad stack before
trap_init().

As NMI is also enabled in trap_init(), we don't need to care
about is_debug_stack() and related things used in
arch/x86/kernel/nmi.c.
