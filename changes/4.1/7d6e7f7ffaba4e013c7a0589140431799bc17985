powerpc/mm/thp: Return pte address if we find trans_splitting.

For THP that is marked trans splitting, we return the pte.
This require the callers to handle the pmd_trans_splitting scenario,
if they care. All the current callers are either looking at pfn or
write_ok, hence we don't need to update them.
