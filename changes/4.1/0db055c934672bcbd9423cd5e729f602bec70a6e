cc2520: Do not store platform_data in spi_device

Storing the `platform_data` struct inside of the SPI struct when using
the device tree allows for a later function to edit the content of that
struct. This patch refactors the `cc2520_get_platformat_data` function
to accept a pointer to a `cc2520_platform_data` struct and populates
the fields inside of it.

This change mirrors commit aaa1c4d226e4cd730075d3dac99a6d599a0190c7
("at86rf230: copy pdata to driver allocated space").
