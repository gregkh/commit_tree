blk-mq: free hctx->ctxs in queue's release handler

Now blk_cleanup_queue() can be called before calling
del_gendisk()[1], inside which hctx->ctxs is touched
from blk_mq_unregister_hctx(), but the variable has
been freed by blk_cleanup_queue() at that time.

So this patch moves freeing of hctx->ctxs into queue's
release handler for fixing the oops reported by Stefan.
