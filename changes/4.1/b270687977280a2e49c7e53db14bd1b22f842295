ARM: dts: Add keep-power-in-suspend to WiFi SDIO node for Peach Boards

The Marvell mwifiex driver prevents the system to enter into a suspend
state if the card power is not preserved during a suspend/resume cycle.

So Suspend-to-RAM and Suspend-to-idle is failing on Exynos5800 Peach Pi
and Exynos5420 Peach Pit Chromebooks.

Add the keep-power-in-suspend Power Management property to the SDIO/MMC
node so the mwifiex suspend handler doesn't fail and the system is able
to enter into a suspend state.
