clockevents: Make tick handover explicit

clockevents_notify() is a leftover from the early design of the
clockevents facility. It's really not a notification mechanism,
it's a multiplex call. We are way better off to have explicit
calls instead of this monstrosity.

Split out the tick_handover call and invoke it explicitely from
the hotplug code. Temporary solution will be cleaned up in later
patches.
