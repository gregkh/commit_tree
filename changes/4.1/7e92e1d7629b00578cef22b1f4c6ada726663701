md/raid6 algorithms: improve test program

It is always helpful to have a test tool in place if we implement
new data critical algorithms. So add some test routines to the raid6
checker that can prove if the new xor_syndrome() works as expected.

Run through all permutations of start/stop pages per algorithm and
simulate a xor_syndrome() assisted rmw run. After each rmw check if
the recovery algorithm still confirms that the stripe is fine.
