IB/core: dma unmap optimizations

While unmapping an ODP writable page, the dirty bit of the page is set. In
order to do so, the head of the compound page is found.
Currently, the compound head is found even on non-writable pages, where it is
never used, leading to unnecessary cpu barrier that impacts performance.

This patch moves the search for the compound head to be done only when needed.
