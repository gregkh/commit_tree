serial: samsung: fix serial console break

This patch fixes problems with serial console break. When function
s3c64xx_serial_startup() was started while serial console has been working,
it caused lose of characters written to TX FIFO. This effect was particularly
observable with systemd, which closes serial port every time when it's
not currently needed, hence function s3c64xx_serial_startup() is called
quite often there. To fix this problem we avoid resetting TX FIFO if port is
used as serial console.

Example of broken console log:
