spmi: remove wakeup command before slave probe

According to spmi spec a slave powers up into startup state and then
transitions into active state. Thus, the wakeup command is not required
before calling the slave's probe. The wakeup command is only needed for
slaves that are in sleep state after receiving the sleep command.
