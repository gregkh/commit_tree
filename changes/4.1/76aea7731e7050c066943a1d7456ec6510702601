perf tools: Fix perf-read-vdsox32 not building and lib64 install dir

Commit:

  c6e5e9fbc3ea ("perf tools: Fix building error in x86_64 when dwarf unwind is on")

removed the definition of IS_X86_64 but not all places using it, with
the consequence that perf-read-vdsox32 would not be built anymore, and
the default lib install directory was 'lib' instead of 'lib64'.

Also needs to go to v3.19.
