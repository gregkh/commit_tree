VFS: Impose ordering on accesses of d_inode and d_flags

Impose ordering on accesses of d_inode and d_flags to avoid the need to do
this:

	if (!dentry->d_inode || d_is_negative(dentry)) {

when this:

	if (d_is_negative(dentry)) {

should suffice.

This check is especially problematic if a dentry can have its type field set
to something other than DENTRY_MISS_TYPE when d_inode is NULL (as in
unionmount).

What we really need to do is stick a write barrier between setting d_inode and
setting d_flags and a read barrier between reading d_flags and reading
d_inode.
