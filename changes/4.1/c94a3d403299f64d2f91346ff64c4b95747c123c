power_supply: 88pm860x_charger: Fix possible NULL pointer dereference and use of initialized variable

Do not put reference to power supply in early exit paths of
pm860x_done_handler() because:
1. it is not yet initialized,
2. it is NULL.

This fixes possible NULL pointer dereference and following build
warning:
drivers/power/88pm860x_charger.c: In function ‘pm860x_done_handler’:
drivers/power/88pm860x_charger.c:516:18: warning: ‘psy’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Additionally this puts the power supply reference before unlocking
mutex. This actually is not needed (there is no race here) but has
logical sense and makes the exit paths cleaner.
