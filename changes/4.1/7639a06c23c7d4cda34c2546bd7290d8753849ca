ALSA: hda - Move a part of hda_codec stuff into hdac_device

Now some codes and functionalities of hda_codec struct are moved to
hdac_device struct.  A few basic attributes like the codec address,
vendor ID number, FG numbers, etc are moved to hdac_device, and they
are accessed like codec->core.addr.  The basic verb exec functions are
moved, too.
