libata: remove ATA_FLAG_LOWTAG

sata_sil24 for some reason pukes when tags are allocated round-robin
which helps tag ordered controllers.  To work around the issue,
72dd299d5039 ("libata: allow sata_sil24 to opt-out of tag ordered
submission") introduced ATA_FLAG_LOWTAG which tells libata tag
allocation to do lowest-first.

However, with the recent switch to blk-mq tag allocation, the liata
tag allocation code path is no longer used and the workaround is now
implemented in the block layer and selected by setting
scsi_host_template->tag_alloc_policy to BLK_TAG_ALLOC_FIFO.  See
9269e23496dd ("libata: make sata_sil24 use fifo tag allocator").

This leaves ATA_FLAG_LOWTAG withoout any actual user.  Remove it.
