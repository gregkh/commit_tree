fib_trie: Replace plen with slen in leaf_info

This replaces the prefix length variable in the leaf_info structure with a
suffix length value, or host identifier length in bits.  By doing this it
makes it easier to sort out since the tnodes and leaf are carrying this
value as well since it is compatible with the ->pos field in tnodes.

I also cleaned up one spot that had some list manipulation that could be
simplified.  I basically updated it so that we just use hlist_add_head_rcu
instead of calling hlist_add_before_rcu on the first node in the list.
