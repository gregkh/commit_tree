drm/i915/skl: Tune IZ hashing when subslices are unbalanced

When one EU is disabled in a particular subslice, we can tune how the
work is spread between subslices to improve EU utilization.

v2: - Use a bitfield to record which subslice(s) has(have) 7 EUs. That
      will also make the machinery work if several sublices have 7 EUs.
      (Jeff Mcgee)
    - Only apply the different hashing algorithm if the slice is
      effectively unbalanced by checking there's a single subslice with
      7 EUs. (Jeff Mcgee)

v3: Fix typo in comment (Jeff Mcgee)
