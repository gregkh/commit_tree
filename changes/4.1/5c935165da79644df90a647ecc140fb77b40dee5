mmc: dw_mmc: Add a timeout for sending CMD11

In the Designware databook's description of the "Voltage Switch Normal
Scenario" it instructs us to set a timer and fail the voltage change
if we don't see the voltage change interrupt within 2ms.  Let's
implement that.  Without implementing this I have often been able to
reproduce a hang while trying to send CMD11 on an rk3288-based board
while constantly ejecting and inserting UHS cards.
