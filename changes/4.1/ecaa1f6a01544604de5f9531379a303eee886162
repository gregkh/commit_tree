vfio-pci: Add VGA arbiter client

If VFIO VGA access is disabled for the user, either by CONFIG option
or module parameter, we can often opt-out of VGA arbitration.  We can
do this when PCI bridge control of VGA routing is possible.  This
means that we must have a parent bridge and there must only be a
single VGA device below that bridge.  Fortunately this is the typical
case for discrete GPUs.

Doing this allows us to minimize the impact of additional GPUs, in
terms of VGA arbitration, when they are only used via vfio-pci for
non-VGA applications.
