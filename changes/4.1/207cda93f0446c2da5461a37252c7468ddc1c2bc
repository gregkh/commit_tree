spi: dw: fix crash on setup stage

The commit 1a7b7ee72c21 (spi: Ensure that CS line is in non-active state after
spi_setup()) introduces an unconditional call of spi_set_cs() before ->setup().
The dw_spi_set_cs() relies on that fact that ->setup() is already called, but
it doesn't now. This patch fixes the crash by adding an additional check to
dw_spi_set_cs().
