mm/migrate: check-before-clear PageSwapCache

With the page flag sanitization patchset, an invalid usage of
ClearPageSwapCache() is detected in migration_page_copy().
migrate_page_copy() is shared by both normal and hugepage (both thp and
hugetlb) code path, so let's check PageSwapCache() and clear it if it's
set to avoid misuse of the invalid clear operation.
