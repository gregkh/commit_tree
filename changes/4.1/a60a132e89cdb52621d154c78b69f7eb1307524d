e1000e: call netif_carrier_off early on down

When bringing down an interface netif_carrier_off() should be
one the first things we do, since this will prevent the stack
from queuing more packets to this interface.
This operation is very fast, and should make the device behave
much nicer when trying to bring down an interface under load.

Also, this would Do The Right Thing (TM) if this device has some
sort of fail-over teaming and redirect traffic to the other IF.

Move netif_carrier_off as early as possible.
