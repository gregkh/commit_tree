spi: img-spfi: Control CS lines with GPIO

When the CONTINUE bit is set, the interrupt status we are polling to
identify if a transaction has finished can be sporadic.  Even though
the transfer has finished, the interrupt status may erroneously
indicate that there is still data in the FIFO.  This behaviour causes
random timeouts in large PIO transfers.

Instead of using the CONTINUE bit to control the CS lines, use the SPI
core's CS GPIO handling.  Also, now that the CONTINUE bit is not being
used, we can poll for the ALLDONE interrupt to indicate transfer
completion.
