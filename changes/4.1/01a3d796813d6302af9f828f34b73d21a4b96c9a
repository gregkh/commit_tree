if_link: Add an additional parameter to ifla_vf_info for RSS querying

Add configuration setting for drivers to allow/block an RSS Redirection
Table and a Hash Key querying for discrete VFs.

On some devices VF share the mentioned above information with PF and
querying it may adduce a theoretical security risk. We want to let a
system administrator to decide if he/she wants to take this risk or not.
