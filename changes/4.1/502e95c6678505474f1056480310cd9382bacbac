drm/vgem: implement virtual GEM

This patch implements the virtual GEM driver with PRIME sharing which
allows vgem to import a gem object from other drivers for the purpose
of mmap-ing them to userspace. The mmap is done using the mmap
operation exported by other drivers.

v2: remove platform_device and do not attach to dma bufs
v3: use drm helpers for get/put pages
v4: correct dumb create pitch
