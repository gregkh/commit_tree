brcmfmac: Fix possible race-condition.

SDIO is using a "shared" variable to handoff ctl frames to DPC
and to see when they are done. In a timeout situation this can
lead to erroneous situation where DPC started to handle the ctl
frame while the timeout expired. This patch will fix this by
adding locking around the shared variable.
