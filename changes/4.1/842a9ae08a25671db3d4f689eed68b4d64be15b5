bridge: Extend Proxy ARP design to allow optional rules for Wi-Fi

This extends the design in commit 958501163ddd ("bridge: Add support for
IEEE 802.11 Proxy ARP") with optional set of rules that are needed to
meet the IEEE 802.11 and Hotspot 2.0 requirements for ProxyARP. The
previously added BR_PROXYARP behavior is left as-is and a new
BR_PROXYARP_WIFI alternative is added so that this behavior can be
configured from user space when required.

In addition, this enables proxyarp functionality for unicast ARP
requests for both BR_PROXYARP and BR_PROXYARP_WIFI since it is possible
to use unicast as well as broadcast for these frames.

The key differences in functionality:

BR_PROXYARP:
- uses the flag on the bridge port on which the request frame was
  received to determine whether to reply
- block bridge port flooding completely on ports that enable proxy ARP

BR_PROXYARP_WIFI:
- uses the flag on the bridge port to which the target device of the
  request belongs
- block bridge port flooding selectively based on whether the proxyarp
  functionality replied
