netfilter: bridge: kill nf_bridge_pad

The br_netfilter frag output function calls skb_cow_head() so in
case it needs a larger headroom to e.g. re-add a previously stripped PPPOE
or VLAN header things will still work (at cost of reallocation).

We can then move nf_bridge_encap_header_len to br_netfilter.
