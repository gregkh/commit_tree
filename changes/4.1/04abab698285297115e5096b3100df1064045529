include/dma-mapping: Clarify output of dma_map_sg

Although dma_map_sg returns 0 on error and it cannot return a
value < 0, the function returns a signed integer.

Most of the time, this function is used with a scatterlist structure.
This structure uses an unsigned integer for the number of memory.

A dma developer that has not read in detail DMA-API.txt, can wrongly
return a value < 0 on error.
