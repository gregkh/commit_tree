IB/iser: Pass struct iser_mem_reg to iser_fast_reg_mr and iser_reg_sig_mr

Instead of passing ib_sge as output variable, we pass the mem_reg
pointer to have the routines fill the rkey as well. This reduces
code duplication and extra assignments. This is a preparation step
to unify some registration logics together. Also, pass iser_fast_reg_mr
the fastreg descriptor directly.

This patch does not change any functionality.
