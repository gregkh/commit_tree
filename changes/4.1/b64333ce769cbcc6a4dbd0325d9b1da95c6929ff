pinctrl: cygnus: add gpio/pinconf driver

This adds the initial support of the Broadcom Cygnus GPIO/PINCONF driver
that supports all 3 GPIO controllers on Cygnus including the ASIU GPIO
controller, the chipCommonG GPIO controller, and the always-on GPIO
controller. Basic PINCONF configurations such as bias pull up/down, and
drive strength are also supported in this driver.

Pins from the ASIU GPIO controller can be individually muxed to GPIO
function, through interaction with the Cygnus IOMUX controller
