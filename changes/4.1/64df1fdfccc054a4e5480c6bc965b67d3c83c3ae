cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix an annoying !CONFIG_SMP warning

I keep seeing

  drivers/cpufreq/intel_pstate.c: In function ‘intel_pstate_init’:
  drivers/cpufreq/intel_pstate.c:1187:26: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
    struct cpuinfo_x86 *c = &boot_cpu_data;

when doing randconfig builds.

This is caused by the fact that when !CONFIG_SMP, asm/processor.h
defines cpu_info to boot_cpu_data and the local variable

  struct cpu_defaults *cpu_info

overshadows it leading to this unfortunate assignment in the
preprocessed source:

 struct cpu_defaults *boot_cpu_data;
 struct cpuinfo_x86 *c = &boot_cpu_data;

Rename the local variable and use static_cpu_has_safe() which alleviates
the need for defining a local cpuinfo_x86 pointer.
