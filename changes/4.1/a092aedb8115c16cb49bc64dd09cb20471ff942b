ARM: 8319/1: advertise availability of v8 Crypto instructions

When running the 32-bit ARM kernel on ARMv8 capable bare metal (e.g.,
32-bit Android userland and kernel on a Cortex-A53), or as a KVM guest
on a 64-bit host, we should advertise the availability of the Crypto
instructions, so that userland libraries such as OpenSSL may use them.
(Support for the v8 Crypto instructions in the 32-bit build was added
to OpenSSL more than six months ago)

This adds the ID feature bit detection, and sets elf_hwcap2 accordingly.
