md/raid6 algorithms: xor_syndrome() for SSE2

The second and (last) optimized XOR syndrome calculation. This version
supports right and left side optimization. All CPUs with architecture
older than Haswell will benefit from it.

It should be noted that SSE2 movntdq kills performance for memory areas
that are read and written simultaneously in chunks smaller than cache
line size. So use movdqa instead for P/Q writes in sse21 and sse22 XOR
functions.
