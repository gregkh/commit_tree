MIPS: math-emu: Remove `modeindex' macro

Commit 56a64733 [MIPS: math-emu: Switch to using the MIPS rounding
modes.] removed the distinction between hardware and emulator rounding
mode encodings, the hardware encoding is now used in emulation as well.
Complement the change and remove the `modeindex' macro previously used
for indexing into encoding translation tables, it now does nothing and
only obfuscates code by reinserting the value extracted from FCSR.
Adjust comments accordingly.
