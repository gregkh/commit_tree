checkpatch: fix --fix use with a patch of multiple files

If a patch touches multiple files, the --fix and --fix-inplace option
doesn't keep the proper line count and makes the new patch file not able
to be applied via bad offset line numbers when lines are added or deleted
by the --fix option.

Dunno how that extra backslash snuck in there.
