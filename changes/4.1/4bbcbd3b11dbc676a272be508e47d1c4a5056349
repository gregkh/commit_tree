VFS: Make pathwalk use d_is_reg() rather than S_ISREG()

Make pathwalk use d_is_reg() rather than S_ISREG() to determine whether to
honour O_TRUNC.  Since this occurs after complete_walk(), the dentry type
field cannot change and the inode pointer cannot change as we hold a ref on
the dentry, so this should be safe.
