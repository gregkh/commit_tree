net: Fix high overhead of vlan sub-device teardown.

When a networking device is taken down that has a non-trivial number
of VLAN devices configured under it, we eat a full synchronize_net()
for every such VLAN device.

This is because of the call chain:

	NETDEV_DOWN notifier
	--> vlan_device_event()
		--> dev_change_flags()
		--> __dev_change_flags()
		--> __dev_close()
		--> __dev_close_many()
		--> dev_deactivate_many()
			--> synchronize_net()

This is kind of rediculous because we already have infrastructure for
batching doing operation X to a list of net devices so that we only
incur one sync.

So make use of that by exporting dev_close_many() and adjusting it's
interfaace so that the caller can fully manage the batch list.  Use
this in vlan_device_event() and all the overhead goes away.
