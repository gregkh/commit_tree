net/9p: use memcpy() instead of snprintf() in p9_mount_tag_show()

p9_mount_tag_show() uses '%s' format string to print
non-NULL terminated chan->tag string. This leads
to out of bounds memory read, because format '%s'
implies that string is NULL-terminated.

The length of string is know here, so its simpler and safer
to use memcpy instead of snprintf().
