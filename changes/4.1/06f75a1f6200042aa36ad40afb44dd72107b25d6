ARM, arm64: kvm: get rid of the bounce page

The HYP init bounce page is a runtime construct that ensures that the
HYP init code does not cross a page boundary. However, this is something
we can do perfectly well at build time, by aligning the code appropriately.

For arm64, we just align to 4 KB, and enforce that the code size is less
than 4 KB, regardless of the chosen page size.

For ARM, the whole code is less than 256 bytes, so we tweak the linker
script to align at a power of 2 upper bound of the code size

Note that this also fixes a benign off-by-one error in the original bounce
page code, where a bounce page would be allocated unnecessarily if the code
was exactly 1 page in size.

On ARM, it also fixes an issue with very large kernels reported by Arnd
Bergmann, where stub sections with linker emitted veneers could erroneously
trigger the size/alignment ASSERT() in the linker script.
