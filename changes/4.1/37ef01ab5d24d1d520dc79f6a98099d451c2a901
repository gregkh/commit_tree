    drm/i915: Stop gathering error states for CS error interrupts

but just clearing is apparently not enough: A sufficiently dead gpu
left behind by firmware (*cough* coreboot *cough*) can keep the gpu in
an endless loop of such interrupts, eventually leading to the nmi
firing. And definitely to what looks like a machine hang.

Since we don't even enable these interrupts on gen5+ let's do the same
on earlier platforms.
