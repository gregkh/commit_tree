md/raid5: remove condition test from check_break_stripe_batch_list.

handle_stripe_clean_event() contains a chunk of code very
similar to check_break_stripe_batch_list().
If we make the latter more like the former, we can end up
with just one copy of this code.

This  first step removed the condition (and the 'check_') part
of the name.  This has the added advantage of making it clear
what check is being performed at the point where the function is
called.
