clockevents: Provide explicit broadcast oneshot control functions

clockevents_notify() is a leftover from the early design of the
clockevents facility. It's really not a notification mechanism,
it's a multiplex call. We are way better off to have explicit
calls instead of this monstrosity.

Split out the broadcast oneshot control into a separate function
and provide inline helpers. Switch clockevents_notify() over.
This will go away once all callers are converted.

This also gets rid of the nested locking of clockevents_lock and
broadcast_lock. The broadcast oneshot control functions do not
require clockevents_lock. Only the managing functions
(setup/shutdown/suspend/resume of the broadcast device require
clockevents_lock.
