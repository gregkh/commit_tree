perf session: Always initialize ordered_events

Even when it is not used to actually reorder events, some of its fields
are used, like session->ordered_events->tool, to shorten function
signatures where tool, for instance, was being passed, as the tool is
needed for the ordered_events code, we need it there and might as well
use it for other perf_session needs.

This fixes a problem where 'perf script' had some condition that made
session->ordered_events not to be initialized even with its
script->tool ordered_events related flags asking for it to be, which
looks like another bug and needs to be investigated further.

Always initializing session->ordered_events at least leaves the current
assumptions in place, so do it now.
