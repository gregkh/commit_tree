drm: Lighten sysfs connector 'status'

Since the beginning, sysfs/connector/status has done a heavyweight
detection of the current connector status. But no user, such as upowerd
or logind, has ever desired to initiate a probe. Move the probing into a
new attribute so that existing readers get the behaviour they desire.

v2: David Herrmann suggested using "echo detect > /sys/.../status" to
trigger the probing, which is a fine idea. This extends that to also
allow the user to apply the force detection overrides at runtime.

v3: Now with airlied's email address fixed! Requires sysfs_streq()
