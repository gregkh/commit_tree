fib_trie: Fix regression in handling of inflate/halve failure

When I updated the code to address a possible null pointer dereference in
resize I ended up reverting an exception handling fix for the suffix length
in the event that inflate or halve failed.  This change is meant to correct
that by reverting the earlier fix and instead simply getting the parent
again after inflate has been completed to avoid the possible null pointer
issue.
