ARM: 8324/1: move cpu_resume() to .text section

Move cpu_resume() to the .text section where it belongs. Change
the adr reference to sleep_save_sp to an explicit PC relative
reference so sleep_save_sp itself can remain in .data.

This helps prevent linker failure on large kernels, as the code
in the .data section may be too far away to be in range for normal
b/bl instructions.
