MIPS: lose_fpu(): Disable FPU when MSA enabled

The lose_fpu() function only disables the FPU in CP0_Status.CU1 if the
FPU is in use and MSA isn't enabled.

This isn't necessarily a problem because KSTK_STATUS(current), the
version of CP0_Status stored on the kernel stack on entry from user
mode, does always get updated and gets restored when returning to user
mode, but I don't think it was intended, and it is inconsistent with the
case of only the FPU being in use. Sometimes leaving the FPU enabled may
also mask kernel bugs where FPU operations are executed when the FPU
might not be enabled.

So lets disable the FPU in the MSA case too.
