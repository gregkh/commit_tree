Bluetooth: Read Verbose Config Version Info for Broadcom devices

The Broadcom devices expose their chip id via Read Verbose Config
Version Info command. While this information is not used at the
moment, it might be useful for debugging purposes and so read it
before patching the firmware. This makes it show up in dmesg and
HCI traces taken for the system.
