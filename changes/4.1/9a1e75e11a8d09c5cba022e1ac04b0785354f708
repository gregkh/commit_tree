ahci: st: st_configure_oob must be called after IP is clocked.

Currently the ahci_st driver will hang the system on probe, as the
st_configure_oob function does some register writes before the IP
is clocked. This patch moves the function call to after
ahci_platform_enable_resources (which enables the IP clock), and
resolves the hang.

Addtionally st_ahci_configure_oob should be called in the st_ahci_resume
function, so we also rectify that ensuring it is also called after
the IP clock has been enabled.
