perf callchain: Separate eh/debug frame offset cache.

Commit f1f13af99a90 ("perf callchain: Cache eh/debug frame offset for
dwarf unwind") introduces a cache for .debug_frame and .eh_frame_hdr.
Unfortunately, it makes them share a same cache (dso->frame_offset).
Which causes unwind failure on ARM:

   $ perf test unwind
  Test dwarf unwind: FAILED!

The reason is that, if a dso has '.debug_frame' but doesn't have
'.eh_frame_hdr' (like ARM), dso->frame_offset will be filled by offset
of '.debug_frame' during the first time calling of find_proc_info() ->
read_unwind_spec_debug_frame(), and be regarded to '.eh_frame_hdr' when
the second time calling of find_proc_info() ->
read_unwind_spec_eh_frame(), since '.eh_frame_hdr' is checked prior to
'.debug_frame'.

This patch solves the problem by creating two cache fields for
'.eh_frame_hdr' and '.debug_frame'.
