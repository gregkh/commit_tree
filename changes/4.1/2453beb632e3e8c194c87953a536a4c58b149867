stmmac: Add defines and documentation for enabling flow control

Add defines and documentation for enabling flow control on the stmmac. Flow
control was not implemented correctly on the stmmac driver and is currently
non-functional as a result. This is the first in a series of small patches
to correctly implement this feature.
