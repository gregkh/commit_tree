i40e: Avoid logs while adding/deleting FD-SB filters

It is not necessary to print FD filter add/delete log with
normal debug settings because ethtool -n ethx shows all the FD-SB
filters on an interface. The log can still be turned on through higher
debug levels and it will continue to print a log if there was an error
in the add/delete process.
