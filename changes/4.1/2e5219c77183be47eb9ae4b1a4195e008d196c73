hwmon: (pwm-fan) Read PWM FAN configuration from device tree

This patch provides code for reading PWM FAN configuration data via
device tree. The pwm-fan can work with full speed when configuration
is not provided. However, errors are propagated when wrong DT bindings
are found.
Additionally the struct pwm_fan_ctx has been extended.
