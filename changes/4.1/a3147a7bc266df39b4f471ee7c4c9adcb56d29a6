s390/dasd: fix unresumed device after suspend/resume

The DASD device driver only has a limited amount of memory to build
I/O requests.
This memory was used by blocklayer requests leading to an inability
to build needed internal requests to resume the device.
Fix by preventing the DASD driver to fetch requests for a stopped
device.
