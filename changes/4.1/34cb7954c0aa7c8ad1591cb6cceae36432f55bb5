KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Convert ICS mutex lock to spin lock

Replaces the ICS mutex lock with a spin lock since we will be porting
these routines to real mode. Note that we need to disable interrupts
before we take the lock in anticipation of the fact that on the guest
side, we are running in the context of a hard irq and interrupts are
disabled (EE bit off) when the lock is acquired. Again, because we
will be acquiring the lock in hypervisor real mode, we need to use
an arch_spinlock_t instead of a normal spinlock here as we want to
avoid running any lockdep code (which may not be safe to execute in
real mode).
