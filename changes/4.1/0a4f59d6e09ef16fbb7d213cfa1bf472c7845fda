x86/vdso: Fix the x86 vdso2c tool includes

The build-time tool arch/x86/vdso/vdso2c.c includes <linux/elf.h>,
but cannot find it, unless the build host happens to provide it.

It should be reading the uapi linux/elf.h

This build regression came along with the vdso2c changes between
v3.15 and v3.16.
