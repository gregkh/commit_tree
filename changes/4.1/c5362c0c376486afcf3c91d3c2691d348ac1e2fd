perf/x86: Add 3 new scheduling callbacks

This patch adds 3 new PMU model specific callbacks
during the event scheduling done by x86_schedule_events().

  ->start_scheduling():  invoked when entering the schedule routine.
  ->stop_scheduling():   invoked at the end of the schedule routine
  ->commit_scheduling(): invoked for each committed event

To be used optionally by model-specific code.
