perf build: Get rid of VF_FEATURE_TESTS

It only contains (FEATURE_TESTS - FEATURE_DISPLAY) tests to display the
rest of the checks on 'make VF=1'. But we can actually compute this
list, which is less confusing.

Also renaming LIB_FEATURE_TESTS into FEATURE_DISPLAY, so it reflects
what this variable actually does - display its tests status to user.
