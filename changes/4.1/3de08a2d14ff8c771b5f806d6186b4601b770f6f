staging: sm750fb: Use memset_io instead of memset

This patch takes into account that cursor->vstart, crtc->vScreen and
share->pvMem are pointers to memory-mapped I/O and thus we should use memset_io
to make this explicit. In addition, some architectures require special treatment
of memory-mapped I/O so the previous code could actually break without this
change.

This fixes the following sparse warnings:-
