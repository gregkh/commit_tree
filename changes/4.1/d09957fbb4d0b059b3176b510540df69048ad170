mtd: cfi: reduce stack size

The cfi_staa_write_buffers function uses a large amount of kernel stack
whenever CONFIG_MTD_MAP_BANK_WIDTH_32 is set, and that results in a
warning on ARM allmodconfig builds:

drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_cmdset_0020.c: In function 'cfi_staa_write_buffers':
drivers/mtd/chips/cfi_cmdset_0020.c:651:1: warning: the frame size of 1208 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]

It turns out that this is largely a result of a suboptimal implementation
of map_word_andequal(). Replacing this function with a straightforward
one reduces the stack size in this function by exactly 200 bytes,
shrinks the .text segment for this file from 27648 bytes to 26608 bytes,
and makes the warning go away.
