tracing: Update trace-event-sample with TRACE_SYSTEM_VAR documentation

Add documentation about TRACE_SYSTEM needing to be alpha-numeric or with
underscores, and that if it is not, then the use of TRACE_SYSTEM_VAR is
required to make something that is.

An example of this is shown in samples/trace_events/trace-events-sample.h
