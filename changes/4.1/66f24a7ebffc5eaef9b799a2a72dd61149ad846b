net/mlx4_en: Fix port counters statistics bitmask

Two counters (rx_chksum_complete and tx_chksum_offload) are not displayed
under SRIOV for the PF via ethtool because their bit mask is off, fix that.

Fixes: f8c6455bb ('net/mlx4_en: Extend checksum offloading by CHECKSUM COMPLETE')
Fixes: 9fab426de ('mlx4: add a new xmit_more counter')
