perf tools: Define _GNU_SOURCE on pthread_attr_setaffinity_np feature check

The man page for pthread_attr_set_affinity_np states that _GNU_SOURCE
must be defined before pthread.h is included in order to get the proper
function declaration.  Define this in the Makefile.

Without this defined, the feature check fails on a Fedora system with
gcc5 and then the perf build later fails with conflicting prototypes for
the function.
