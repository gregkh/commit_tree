HID: hid-lg4ff: Identify Logitech gaming wheels in compatibility modes

Identify Logitech gaming wheels in compatibility modes accordingly to Logitech
specifications.

Logitech specification contains a general method of identifying various
models of their gaming wheels while they are in "compatibility" mode.
This patch implements the method instead of checking against known
values of bcdDevice. Handling of the mode switch upon initialization is
also adjusted so that the driver does not have to go through the entire
initialization routine because the wheels are set to perform a USB
detach before they reappear in "native" mode.
