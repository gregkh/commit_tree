ARM: proc-arm94*.S: fix setup function

Both ARM946 and ARM940 setup functions were corrupting r1 and r2,
which is not permissible - these are used to carry the machine ID
and boot data into the kernel, and must be preserved.

The code responsible for this was the same in both files: they were
using the registers to generate a protection region register value.

Fix this by turning this process into a macro, and using that macro
in both these files with an alternative register allocation.  r0,
r3 and r7 can be used for temporary values here.
