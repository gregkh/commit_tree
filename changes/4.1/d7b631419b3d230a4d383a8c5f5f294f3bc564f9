MIPS: pgtable-bits: Fix XPA damage to R6 definitions.

Commit be0c37c985ed ("MIPS: Rearrange PTE bits into fixed positions.")
rearranged the PTE bits into fixed positions in preparation for the XPA
support. However, this patch broke R6 since it only took R2 cores
into consideration for the RI/XI bits leading to boot failures. We fix
this by adding the missing CONFIG_CPU_MIPSR6 definitions
