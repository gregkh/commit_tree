powerpc/hugetlb: Call mm_dec_nr_pmds() in hugetlb_free_pmd_range()

Commit dc6c9a35b66b5 ("mm: account pmd page tables to the process")
added a counter that is incremented whenever a PMD is allocated and
decremented whenever a PMD is freed.  For hugepages on PPC, common code
is used to allocated PMDs, but arch-specific code is used to free PMDs.

This results in kernel output such as "BUG: non-zero nr_pmds on freeing
mm: 1" when using hugepages.

Update the PPC hugepage PMD freeing code to decrement the count, just
as the above commit did for free_pmd_range().
