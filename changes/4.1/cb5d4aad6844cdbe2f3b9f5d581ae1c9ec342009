MIPS: bitops.h: Avoid inline asm for constant FLS

GCC is smart enough to substitute the final result for FLS calculations
as implemented in the fallback C code we have in `__fls' and `fls'
applied to constant values.  The presence of inline asm defeats the
compiler though, forcing it to emit extraneous CLZ/DCLZ calculation for
processors that support these instructions.

Use `__builtin_constant_p' then to avoid inline asm altogether for
constants.
