workqueue: make the workqueues list RCU walkable

The workqueues list is protected by wq_pool_mutex and a workqueue and
its subordinate data structures are freed directly on destruction.  We
want to add the ability dump workqueues from a sysrq callback which
requires walking all workqueues without grabbing wq_pool_mutex.  This
patch makes freeing of workqueues RCU protected and makes the
workqueues list walkable while holding RCU read lock.

Note that pool_workqueues and pools are already sched-RCU protected.
For consistency, workqueues are also protected with sched-RCU.

While at it, reverse the workqueues list so that a workqueue which is
created earlier comes before.  The order of the list isn't significant
functionally but this makes the planned sysrq dump list system
workqueues first.
