net/mlx4_en: Change loopback only upon feature change

Currently any change of netdev features results in a call to
mlx4_en_update_loopback_state(). Those calls are unnecessary,
and should be called only upon loopback feature change.

Also moved some of the logic into mlx4_en_update_loopback_state().
