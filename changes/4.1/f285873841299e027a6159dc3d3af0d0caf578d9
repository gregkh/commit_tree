be2net: re-distribute SRIOV resources allowed by FW

When SR-IOV is enabled in the adapter, the FW distributes resources
evenly across the PF and it's VFs. This is currently done only for some
resources.

This patch adds support for a new cmd that queries the FW for the list
of resources for which the distribution is allowed and distributes them
accordingly.
