arm64: KVM: use ID map with increased VA range if required

This patch modifies the HYP init code so it can deal with system
RAM residing at an offset which exceeds the reach of VA_BITS.

Like for EL1, this involves configuring an additional level of
translation for the ID map. However, in case of EL2, this implies
that all translations use the extra level, as we cannot seamlessly
switch between translation tables with different numbers of
translation levels.

So add an extra translation table at the root level. Since the
ID map and the runtime HYP map are guaranteed not to overlap, they
can share this root level, and we can essentially merge these two
tables into one.
