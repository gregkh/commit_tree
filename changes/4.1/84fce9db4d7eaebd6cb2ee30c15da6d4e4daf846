tracing: Fix incorrect enabling of trace events by boot cmdline

There is a problem that trace events are not properly enabled with
boot cmdline. The problem is that if we pass "trace_event=kmem:mm_page_alloc"
to the boot cmdline, it enables all kmem trace events, and not just
the page_alloc event.

This is caused by the parsing mechanism. When we parse the cmdline, the buffer
contents is modified due to tokenization. And, if we use this buffer
again, we will get the wrong result.

Unfortunately, this buffer is be accessed three times to set trace events
properly at boot time. So, we need to handle this situation.

There is already code handling ",", but we need another for ":".
This patch adds it.
