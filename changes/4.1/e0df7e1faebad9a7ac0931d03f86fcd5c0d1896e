checkpatch: avoid "spaces required around that ':'" false positive

Since commit 1f65f947a6a8 ("checkpatch: add checks for question mark and
colon spacing") back in 2008, checkpatch has reported false positive for
asm volatile uses of "::" checkpatch thinks colons should always have
spaces around it.

Add an exception for colons with colons on either side for this valid asm
volatile (and c++) use.
