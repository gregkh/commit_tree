ASoC: Intel: remove misleading DMA error messages on Baytrail platforms

During probe, the Baytrail audio driver reports errors such as:

[44.172040] baytrail-pcm-audio baytrail-pcm-audio: error: invalid DMA engine 0
[44.172137] baytrail-pcm-audio baytrail-pcm-audio: sst_dma_new failed

Those error messages are misleading, there is no error since the DMA
is explicitly not configured for Baytrail.
Add a test to remove DMA error checks when DMA is not configured
and return silently.
