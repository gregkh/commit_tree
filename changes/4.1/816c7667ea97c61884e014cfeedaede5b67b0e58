KVM: s390: migrate vcpu interrupt state

This patch adds support to migrate vcpu interrupts. Two new vcpu ioctls
are added which get/set the complete status of pending interrupts in one
go. The ioctls are marked as available with the new capability
KVM_CAP_S390_IRQ_STATE.

We can not use a ONEREG, as the number of pending local interrupts is not
constant and depends on the number of CPUs.

To retrieve the interrupt state we add an ioctl KVM_S390_GET_IRQ_STATE.
Its input parameter is a pointer to a struct kvm_s390_irq_state which
has a buffer and length.  For all currently pending interrupts, we copy
a struct kvm_s390_irq into the buffer and pass it to userspace.

To store interrupt state into a buffer provided by userspace, we add an
ioctl KVM_S390_SET_IRQ_STATE. It passes a struct kvm_s390_irq_state into
the kernel and injects all interrupts contained in the buffer.
