selftests/timers: Quiet warning due to lack of return check on brk

The posix_timers.c test has a loop that tries to keep it in
kernel space, repeatedly calling brk(). However, it doesn't
check the return value, which causes warnings.

This patch adds a err value which captures the return value
and modifies the test so it will quit if a failure occurs.
