target: Add internal READ_INSERT support

This patch adds READ_INSERT support in target_read_prot_action() that
invokes sbc_dif_generate() when LIO is responsible for generating the
outgoing T10-PI.

Required for supporting fabrics that exchange protection information,
and would like to function with un-protected devices.
