spi: Remove support for legacy PM

All SPI drivers have been converted from legacy suspend/resume callbacks to
dev_pm_ops. So we can finally remove support for legacy PM from the SPI
core.

Since there aren't any special bus specific things to do during
suspend/resume and since the PM core will automatically fallback directly to
using the device's PM ops if no bus PM ops are specified there is no need to
have any special SPI bus PM ops.
