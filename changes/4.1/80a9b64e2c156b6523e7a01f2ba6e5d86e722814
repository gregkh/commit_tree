ring-buffer: Replace this_cpu_*() with __this_cpu_*()

It has come to my attention that this_cpu_read/write are horrible on
architectures other than x86. Worse yet, they actually disable
preemption or interrupts! This caused some unexpected tracing results
on ARM.

   101.356868: preempt_count_add <-ring_buffer_lock_reserve
   101.356870: preempt_count_sub <-ring_buffer_lock_reserve

The ring_buffer_lock_reserve has recursion protection that requires
accessing a per cpu variable. But since preempt_disable() is traced, it
too got traced while accessing the variable that is suppose to prevent
recursion like this.

The generic version of this_cpu_read() and write() are:

 #define this_cpu_generic_read(pcp)					\
 ({	typeof(pcp) ret__;						\
	preempt_disable();						\
	ret__ = *this_cpu_ptr(&(pcp));					\
	preempt_enable();						\
	ret__;								\
 })

 #define this_cpu_generic_to_op(pcp, val, op)				\
 do {									\
	unsigned long flags;						\
	raw_local_irq_save(flags);					\
	*__this_cpu_ptr(&(pcp)) op val;					\
	raw_local_irq_restore(flags);					\
 } while (0)

Which is unacceptable for locations that know they are within preempt
disabled or interrupt disabled locations.

Paul McKenney stated that __this_cpu_() versions produce much better code on
other architectures than this_cpu_() does, if we know that the call is done in
a preempt disabled location.

I also changed the recursive_unlock() to use two local variables instead
of accessing the per_cpu variable twice.
