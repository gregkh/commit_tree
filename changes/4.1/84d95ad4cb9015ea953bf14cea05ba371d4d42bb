x86/lib/memset_64.S: Convert to ALTERNATIVE_2 macro

Make alternatives replace single JMPs instead of whole memset functions,
thus decreasing the amount of instructions copied during patching time
at boot.

While at it, make it use the REP_GOOD version by default which means
alternatives NOP out the JMP to the other versions, as REP_GOOD is set
by default on the majority of relevant x86 processors.
