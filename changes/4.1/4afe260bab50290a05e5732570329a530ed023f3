CIFS: Fix race condition on RFC1002_NEGATIVE_SESSION_RESPONSE

This patch fixes a race condition that occurs when connecting
to a NT 3.51 host without specifying a NetBIOS name.
In that case a RFC1002_NEGATIVE_SESSION_RESPONSE is received
and the SMB negotiation is reattempted, but under some conditions
it leads SendReceive() to hang forever while waiting for srv_mutex.
This, in turn, sets the calling process to an uninterruptible sleep
state and makes it unkillable.

The solution is to unlock the srv_mutex acquired in the demux
thread *before* going to sleep (after the reconnect error) and
before reattempting the connection.
