ip_forward: Drop frames with attached skb->sk

Initial discussion was:
[FYI] xfrm: Don't lookup sk_policy for timewait sockets

Forwarded frames should not have a socket attached. Especially
tw sockets will lead to panics later-on in the stack.

This was observed with TPROXY assigning a tw socket and broken
policy routing (misconfigured). As a result frame enters
forwarding path instead of input. We cannot solve this in
TPROXY as it cannot know that policy routing is broken.
