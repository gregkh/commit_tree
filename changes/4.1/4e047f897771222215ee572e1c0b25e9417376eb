mm: refactor do_wp_page, extract the reuse case

Currently do_wp_page contains 265 code lines.  It also contains 9 goto
statements, of which 5 are targeting labels which are not cleanup
related.  This makes the function extremely difficult to understand.

The following patches are an attempt at breaking the function to its
basic components, and making it easier to understand.

The patches are straight forward function extractions from do_wp_page.
As we extract functions, we remove unneeded parameters and simplify the
code as much as possible.  However, the functionality is supposed to
remain completely unchanged.  The patches also attempt to document the
functionality of each extracted function.  In patch 2, we split the
unlock logic to the contain logic relevant to specific needs of each use
case, instead of having huge number of conditional decisions in a single
unlock flow.

This patch (of 4):

When do_wp_page is ending, in several cases it needs to reuse the existing
page.  This is achieved by making the page table writable, and possibly
updating the page-cache state.

Currently, this logic was "called" by using a goto jump.  This makes
following the control flow of the function harder.  It is also against the
coding style guidelines for using goto.

As the code can easily be refactored into a specialized function, refactor
it out and simplify the code flow in do_wp_page.
