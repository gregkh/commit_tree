    perf trace: No need to enable evsels for workload started from perf

The assumption was that whenever a workload is specified, the
attr.enable_on_exec evsel flag would be set, but that is not happening
when perf_record_opts.system_wide is set, for instance

That resulted in both perf_evlist__enable() and attr.enable_on_exec
being not called/set, which made the events to remain disabled while the
workload runs, producing no output.

Fix it,  by calling perf_evlist__enable() in the 'trace' tool
when forking and not targetting a workload started from trace

v2: Test against !target__none(), as suggested by Namhyung Kim, that is
what is used in perf_evsel__config() when deciding if the
attr.enable_on_exec flag to be set. More work is needed to cover other
cases such as opts->initial_delay.
