irqf_oneshot.cocci: add check of devm_request_threaded_irq()

Since commit 1c6c69525b40eb76de8adf039409722015927dc3 ("genirq: Reject
bogus threaded irq requests") threaded IRQs without a primary handler
need to be requested with IRQF_ONESHOT, otherwise the request will fail.

Until now, this coccinelle script only checked request_threaded_irq().
However, the counterpart devm function (see kernel/irq/devres.c) is also
affected by the missing flag which can be detected with this patch.
