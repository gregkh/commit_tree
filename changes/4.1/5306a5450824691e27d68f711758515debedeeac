MIPS: Makefile: Fix MIPS ASE detection code

Commit 32098ec7bcba ("MIPS: Makefile: Move the ASEs checks after
setting the core's CFLAGS") re-arranged the MIPS ASE detection code
and also added the current cflags to the detection logic. However,
this introduced a few bugs. First of all, the mips-cflags should not
be quoted since that ends up being passed as a string to subsequent
commands leading to broken detection from the cc-option-* tools.
Moreover, in order to avoid duplicating the cflags-y because of how
cc-option works, we rework the logic so we pass only those cflags which
are needed by the selected ASE. Finally, fix some typos resulting in MSA
not being detected correctly.
