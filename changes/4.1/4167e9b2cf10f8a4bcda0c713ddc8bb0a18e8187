mm: remove GFP_THISNODE

NOTE: this is not about __GFP_THISNODE, this is only about GFP_THISNODE.

GFP_THISNODE is a secret combination of gfp bits that have different
behavior than expected.  It is a combination of __GFP_THISNODE,
__GFP_NORETRY, and __GFP_NOWARN and is special-cased in the page
allocator slowpath to fail without trying reclaim even though it may be
used in combination with __GFP_WAIT.

An example of the problem this creates: commit e97ca8e5b864 ("mm: fix
GFP_THISNODE callers and clarify") fixed up many users of GFP_THISNODE
that really just wanted __GFP_THISNODE.  The problem doesn't end there,
however, because even it was a no-op for alloc_misplaced_dst_page(),
which also sets __GFP_NORETRY and __GFP_NOWARN, and
migrate_misplaced_transhuge_page(), where __GFP_NORETRY and __GFP_NOWAIT
is set in GFP_TRANSHUGE.  Converting GFP_THISNODE to __GFP_THISNODE is a
no-op in these cases since the page allocator special-cases
__GFP_THISNODE && __GFP_NORETRY && __GFP_NOWARN.

It's time to just remove GFP_THISNODE entirely.  We leave __GFP_THISNODE
to restrict an allocation to a local node, but remove GFP_THISNODE and
its obscurity.  Instead, we require that a caller clear __GFP_WAIT if it
wants to avoid reclaim.

This allows the aforementioned functions to actually reclaim as they
should.  It also enables any future callers that want to do
__GFP_THISNODE but also __GFP_NORETRY && __GFP_NOWARN to reclaim.  The
rule is simple: if you don't want to reclaim, then don't set __GFP_WAIT.

Aside: ovs_flow_stats_update() really wants to avoid reclaim as well, so
it is unchanged.
