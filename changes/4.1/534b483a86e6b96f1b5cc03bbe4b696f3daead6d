cpumask: don't perform while loop in cpumask_next_and()

cpumask_next_and() is looking for cpumask_next() in src1 in a loop and
tests if found cpu is also present in src2. remove that loop, perform
cpumask_and() of src1 and src2 first and use that new mask to find
cpumask_next().

Apart from removing while loop, ./bloat-o-meter on x86_64 shows
add/remove: 0/0 grow/shrink: 0/1 up/down: 0/-8 (-8)
function                                     old     new   delta
cpumask_next_and                              62      54      -8
