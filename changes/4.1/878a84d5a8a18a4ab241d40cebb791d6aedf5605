arm64: add missing data types in smp_load_acquire/smp_store_release

Commit 8053871d0f7f ("smp: Fix smp_call_function_single_async()
locking") introduced a call to smp_load_acquire() with a u16 argument,
but we only cared about u32 and u64 types in that function so far.
This resulted in a compiler warning fortunately, pointing at an
uninitialized use. Due to the implementation structure the compiler
misses that bug in the smp_store_release(), though.
Add the u16 and u8 variants using ldarh/stlrh and ldarb/stlrb,
respectively. Together with the compiletime_assert_atomic_type() check
this should cover all cases now.
