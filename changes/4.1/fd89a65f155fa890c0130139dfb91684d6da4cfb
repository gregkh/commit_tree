powerpc/oprofile: reduce mmap_sem hold for exe_file

In the future mm->exe_file will be done without mmap_sem serialization,
thus isolate and reorganize the related code to make the transition
easier.  Good users will, make use of the more standard get_mm_exe_file(),
requiring only holding the mmap_sem to read the value, and relying on
reference counting to make sure that the exe file won't dissappear
underneath us while getting the dcookie.
