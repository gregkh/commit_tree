i40e: Don't check operational or sync bit for App TLV

In CEE mode the firmware does not set the operational status bit of
the application TLV status as returned from the "Get CEE DCBX Oper Cfg"
AQ command. This occurs whenever a DCBX configuration is changed.

This is a workaround to remove the check for the operational and sync bits
of the application TLV status till a firmware fix is provided.
