qla2xxx: Restore physical port WWPN only, when port down detected for FA-WWPN port.

For FA-WWPN is enabled port, if NPIV created on that port and,
if port link is brought down, then WWPN was restored from flash for both
physical and NPIV port. This will result in NPIV port and physical port
sharing same WWPN. Any application refreshing ports information  will
not be able to scan NPIV port because of this behavior. So while restoring WWPN,
only restore physical port WWPN.
