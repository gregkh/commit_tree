hexdump: avoid warning in test function

The test_data_1_le[] array is a const array of const char *.  To avoid
dropping any const information, we need to use "const char * const *",
not just "const char **".

I'm not sure why the different test arrays end up having different
const'ness, but let's make the pointer we use to traverse them as const
as possible, since we modify neither the array of pointers _or_ the
pointers we find in the array.
