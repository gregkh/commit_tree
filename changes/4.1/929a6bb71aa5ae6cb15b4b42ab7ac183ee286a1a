tools lib traceevent: Factor out allocating and processing args

The sequence of allocating the print_arg field, calling process_arg()
and verifying that the next event delimiter is repeated twice in
process_hex() and will also be used for process_int_array().

Factor it out to a function to avoid writing the same code again and
again.
