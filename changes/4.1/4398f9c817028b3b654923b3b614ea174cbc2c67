sh_eth: Mitigate lost statistics updates

The statistics registers have write-clear behaviour, which means we
will lose any increment between the read and write.  Mitigate this by
only clearing when we read a non-zero value, so we will never falsely
report a total of zero.  This also saves time as we only handle
error statistics here and they won't often be incremented.
