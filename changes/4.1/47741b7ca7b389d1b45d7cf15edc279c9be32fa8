DLM lock and unlock functions

A dlm_lock_resource is a structure which contains all information
required for locking using DLM. The init function allocates the
lock and acquires the lock in NL mode. The unlock function
converts the lock resource to NL mode. This is done to preserve
LVB and for faster processing of locks. The lock resource is
DLM unlocked only in the lockres_free function, which is the end
of life of the lock resource.
