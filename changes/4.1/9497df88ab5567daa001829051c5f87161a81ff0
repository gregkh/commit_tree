rhashtable: Fix reader/rehash race

There is a potential race condition between readers and the rehasher.
In particular, the rehasher could have started a rehash while the
reader finishes a scan of the old table but fails to see the new
table pointer.

This patch closes this window by adding smp_wmb/smp_rmb.
