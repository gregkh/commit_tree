PM / sleep: add configurable delay for pm_test

When CONFIG_PM_DEBUG=y, we provide a sysfs file (/sys/power/pm_test) for
selecting one of a few suspend test modes, where rather than entering a
full suspend state, the kernel will perform some subset of suspend
steps, wait 5 seconds, and then resume back to normal operation.

This mode is useful for (among other things) observing the state of the
system just before entering a sleep mode, for debugging or analysis
purposes. However, a constant 5 second wait is not sufficient for some
sorts of analysis; for example, on an SoC, one might want to use
external tools to probe the power states of various on-chip controllers
or clocks.

This patch turns this 5 second delay into a configurable module
parameter, so users can determine how long to wait in this
pseudo-suspend state before resuming the system.

Example (wait 30 seconds);

  # echo 30 > /sys/module/suspend/parameters/pm_test_delay
  # echo core > /sys/power/pm_test
  # time echo mem  > /sys/power/state
  ...
  [   17.583625] suspend debug: Waiting for 30 second(s).
  ...
  real	0m30.381s
  user	0m0.017s
  sys	0m0.080s
