platform/chrome: chromeos_laptop - instantiate Atmel at primary address

The new Atmel MXT driver expects i2c client's address contain the
primary (main address) of the chip, and calculates the expected
bootloader address form the primary address. Unfortunately chrome_laptop
does probe the devices and if touchpad (or touchscreen, or both) comes
up in bootloader mode the i2c device gets instantiated with the
bootloader address which confuses the driver.

To work around this issue let's probe the primary address first. If the
device is not detected at the primary address we'll probe alternative
addresses as "dummy" devices. If any of them are found, destroy the
dummy client and instantiate client with proper name at primary address
still.
