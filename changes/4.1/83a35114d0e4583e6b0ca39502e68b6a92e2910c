lguest: fix out-by-one error in address checking.

This bug has been there since day 1; addresses in the top guest physical
page weren't considered valid.  You could map that page (the check in
check_gpte() is correct), but if a guest tried to put a pagetable there
we'd check that address manually when walking it, and kill the guest.
