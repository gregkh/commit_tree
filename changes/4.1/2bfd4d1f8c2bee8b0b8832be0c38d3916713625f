ftracetest: Do not use usleep directly

The usleep is only provided on distros from Redhat so running ftracetest
on other distro resulted in failures due to the missing usleep.

The reason of using [u]sleep in the test was to generate (scheduler)
events.  It can be done various ways like this:

yield() {  ping localhost -c 1 || sleep .001 || usleep 1 || sleep 1; }
