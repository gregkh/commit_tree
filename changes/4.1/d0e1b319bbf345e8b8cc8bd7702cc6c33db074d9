be2net: refactor error detect/recovery function

Currently when an error is detected, the queue resources are being cleaned up
in the recovery routine. The resources are better cleaned up in the error
detection routine itself (similar to EEH code.)
So, this patch re-factors error processing logic to follow the following sequence:
	- check if there is an error in adapter
	- if error,
		- cleanup resources
		- attempt recovery

The patch renames lancer_recover_func() to be_err_recover() as this
routine will be used in the future for error recovery on Skyhawk too.
