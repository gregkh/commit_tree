arm64: alternative: Allow immediate branch as alternative instruction

Since all immediate branches are PC-relative on Aarch64, these
instructions cannot be used as an alternative with the simplistic
approach we currently have (the immediate has been computed from
the .altinstr_replacement section, and end-up being completely off
if we insert it directly).

This patch handles the b and bl instructions in a different way,
using the insn framework to recompute the immediate, and generate
the right displacement.
