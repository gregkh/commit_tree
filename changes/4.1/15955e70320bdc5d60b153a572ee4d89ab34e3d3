ARM: 8328/1: remove empty preprocessor #else branch

When the patch for e16343c47e42 (ARM: 8160/1: drop warning about
return_address not using unwind tables) was created there was still more
code in said branch. Probably this simplification was just missed during
conflict resolution when the patch was applied.
