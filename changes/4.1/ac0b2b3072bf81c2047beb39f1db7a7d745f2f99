[media] media: omap/omap_vout: fix type of input members to omap_vout_setup_vrfb_bufs()

the declaration for omap_vout_setup_vrfb_bufs() said it
needed 'u32 static_vrfb_allocation' but definition
took 'bool static_vrfb_allocation', this patch fixes the
declaration so that it matches with the definition and
pass a bool instead of int to the call, also included
omap_vout_vrfb.h in omap_vout_vrfb.c file so that sparse doesn't
complain of making omap_vout_setup_vrfb_bufs() as static function.
