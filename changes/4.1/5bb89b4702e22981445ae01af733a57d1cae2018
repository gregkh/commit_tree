NFSv4.1/pnfs: Separate out metadata and data consistency for pNFS

The LAYOUTCOMMIT operation means different things to different layout types.
For blocks and objects, it is both a data and metadata consistency operation.
For files and flexfiles, it is only a metadata consistency operation.

This patch separates out the 2 cases, allowing the files/flexfiles layout
drivers to optimise away the data consistency calls to layoutcommit.
