perf tools: Reference count struct thread

We need to do that to stop accumulating entries in the dead_threads
linked list, i.e. we were keeping references to threads in struct hists
that continue to exist even after a thread exited and was removed from
the machine threads rbtree.

We still keep the dead_threads list, but just for debugging, allowing us
to iterate at any given point over the threads that still are referenced
by things like struct hist_entry.
