tipc: fix nullpointer bug when subscribing to events

If a subscription request is sent to a topology server
connection, and any error occurs (malformed request, oom
or limit reached) while processing this request, TIPC should
terminate the subscriber connection. While doing so, it tries
to access fields in an already freed (or never allocated)
subscription element leading to a nullpointer exception.
We fix this by removing the subscr_terminate function and
terminate the connection immediately upon any subscription
failure.
