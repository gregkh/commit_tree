mlx4: Fix tx ring affinity_mask creation

By default, the number of tx queues is limited by the number of online cpus
in mlx4_en_get_profile(). However, this limit no longer holds after the
ethtool .set_channels method has been called. In that situation, the driver
may access invalid bits of certain cpumask variables when queue_index >=
nr_cpu_ids.
