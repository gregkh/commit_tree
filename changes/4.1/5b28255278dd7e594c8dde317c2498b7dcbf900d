audit: reduce mmap_sem hold for mm->exe_file

The mm->exe_file is currently serialized with mmap_sem (shared)
in order to both safely (1) read the file and (2) audit it via
audit_log_d_path(). Good users will, on the other hand, make use
of the more standard get_mm_exe_file(), requiring only holding
the mmap_sem to read the value, and relying on reference counting
to make sure that the exe file won't dissapear underneath us.

Additionally, upon NULL return of get_mm_exe_file, we also call
audit_log_format(ab, " exe=(null)").
