rcu: Get rcu_sched_force_quiescent_state() where it belongs

The very similar functions rcu_force_quiescent_state(),
rcu_bh_force_quiescent_state(), and rcu_sched_force_quiescent_state()
are supposed to be together, but have drifted apart.  This commit
restores rcu_sched_force_quiescent_state() to its rightful place.
