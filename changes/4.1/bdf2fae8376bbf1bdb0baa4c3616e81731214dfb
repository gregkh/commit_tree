iwlwifi: ignore IBSS flag as regulatory NO-IR indication

According to updated regulatory guidelines, the ACTIVE bit in the NVM
also allows ibss activity on the channel. The IBSS NVM bit is not updated
when LAR is active and is deprecated. Using this bit for NO-IR incorrectly
causes all 5Ghz channels to be marked as passive.
