ocfs2: check if the ocfs2 lock resource has been initialized before calling ocfs2_dlm_lock

If ocfs2 lockres has not been initialized before calling ocfs2_dlm_lock,
the lock won't be dropped and then will lead umount hung.  The case is
described below:

ocfs2_mknod
    ocfs2_mknod_locked
        __ocfs2_mknod_locked
            ocfs2_journal_access_di
            Failed because of -ENOMEM or other reasons, the inode lockres
            has not been initialized yet.

    iput(inode)
        ocfs2_evict_inode
            ocfs2_delete_inode
                ocfs2_inode_lock
                    ocfs2_inode_lock_full_nested
                        __ocfs2_cluster_lock
                        Succeeds and allocates a new dlm lockres.
            ocfs2_clear_inode
                ocfs2_open_unlock
                    ocfs2_drop_inode_locks
                        ocfs2_drop_lock
                        Since lockres has not been initialized, the lock
                        can't be dropped and the lockres can't be
                        migrated, thus umount will hang forever.
