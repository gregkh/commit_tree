cleancache: remove limit on the number of cleancache enabled filesystems

The limit equals 32 and is imposed by the number of entries in the
fs_poolid_map and shared_fs_poolid_map.  Nowadays it is insufficient,
because with containers on board a Linux host can have hundreds of
active fs mounts.

These maps were introduced by commit 49a9ab815acb8 ("mm: cleancache:
lazy initialization to allow tmem backends to build/run as modules") in
order to allow compiling cleancache drivers as modules.  Real pool ids
are stored in these maps while super_block->cleancache_poolid points to
an entry in the map, so that on cleancache registration we can walk over
all (if there are <= 32 of them, of course) cleancache-enabled super
blocks and assign real pool ids.

Actually, there is absolutely no need in these maps, because we can
iterate over all super blocks immediately using iterate_supers.  This is
not racy, because cleancache_init_ops is called from mount_fs with
super_block->s_umount held for writing, while iterate_supers takes this
semaphore for reading, so if we call iterate_supers after setting
cleancache_ops, all super blocks that had been created before
cleancache_register_ops was called will be assigned pool ids by the
action function of iterate_supers while all newer super blocks will
receive it in cleancache_init_fs.

This patch therefore removes the maps and hence the artificial limit on
the number of cleancache enabled filesystems.
