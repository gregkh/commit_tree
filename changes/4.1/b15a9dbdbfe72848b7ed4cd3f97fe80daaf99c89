md/raid5: Ensure a batch member is not handled prematurely.

If a stripe is a member of a batch, but not the head, it must
not be handled separately from the rest of the batch.

'clear_batch_ready()' handles this requirement to some
extent but not completely.  If a member is passed to handle_stripe()
a second time it returns '0' indicating the stripe can be handled,
which is wrong.
So add an extra test.
