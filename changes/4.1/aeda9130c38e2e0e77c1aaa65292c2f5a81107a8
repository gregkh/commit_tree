arm/arm64: KVM: Optimize handling of Access Flag faults

Now that we have page aging in Stage-2, it becomes obvious that
we're doing way too much work handling the fault.

The page is not going anywhere (it is still mapped), the page
tables are already allocated, and all we want is to flip a bit
in the PMD or PTE. Also, we can avoid any form of TLB invalidation,
since a page with the AF bit off is not allowed to be cached.

An obvious solution is to have a separate handler for FSC_ACCESS,
where we pride ourselves to only do the very minimum amount of
work.
