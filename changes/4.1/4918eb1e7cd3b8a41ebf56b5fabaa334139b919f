bna: remove unreasonable iocpf timer start

Driver starts iocpf timer prior bnad_ioceth_enable() call and this is
unreasonable. This piece of code probably originates from Brocade/Qlogic
out-of-box driver during initial import into upstream. This driver uses
only one timer and queue to implement multiple timers and this timer is
started at this place. The upstream driver uses multiple timers instead
of this.
