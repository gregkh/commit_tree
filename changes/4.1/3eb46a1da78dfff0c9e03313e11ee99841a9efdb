of_net: factor out repetitive code from of_get_mac_address()

of_get_mac_address() basically does the same  thing thrice, every  time with  a
different  property  name,  so it makes sense to factor out the repetitive code
into separate function. While at it, we can start using ETH_ALEN instead of the
bare number and drop unnecessary parens around the property length check.

The resulting ARM object file is 100 bytes less in size than before the patch.
