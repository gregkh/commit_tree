drm/nouveau/instmem/gk20a: use DMA attributes

instmem for GK20A is allocated using dma_alloc_coherent(), which
provides us with a coherent CPU mapping that we never use because
instmem objects are accessed through PRAMIN. Switch to
dma_alloc_attrs() which gives us the option to dismiss that CPU mapping
and free up some CPU virtual space.
