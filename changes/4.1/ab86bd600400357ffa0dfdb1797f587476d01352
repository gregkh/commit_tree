MIPS: KVM: Expose MSA registers

Add KVM register numbers for the MIPS SIMD Architecture (MSA) registers,
and implement access to them with the KVM_GET_ONE_REG / KVM_SET_ONE_REG
ioctls when the MSA capability is enabled (exposed in a later patch) and
present in the guest according to its Config3.MSAP bit.

The MSA vector registers use the same register numbers as the FPU
registers except with a different size (128bits). Since MSA depends on
Status.FR=1, these registers are inaccessible when Status.FR=0. These
registers are returned as a single native endian 128bit value, rather
than least significant half first with each 64-bit half native endian as
the kernel uses internally.
