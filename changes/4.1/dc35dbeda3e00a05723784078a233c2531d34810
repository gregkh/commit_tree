fib_trie: Add tnode struct as a container for fields not needed in key_vector

This change pulls the fields not explicitly needed in the key_vector and
placed them in the new tnode structure.  By doing this we will eventually
be able to reduce the key_vector down to 16 bytes on 64 bit systems, and
12 bytes on 32 bit systems.
