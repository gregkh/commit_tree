Revert "selinux: add a skb_owned_by() hook"

This reverts commit ca10b9e9a8ca7342ee07065289cbe74ac128c169.

No longer needed after commit eb8895debe1baba41fcb62c78a16f0c63c21662a
("tcp: tcp_make_synack() should use sock_wmalloc")

When under SYNFLOOD, we build lot of SYNACK and hit false sharing
because of multiple modifications done on sk_listener->sk_wmem_alloc

Since tcp_make_synack() uses sock_wmalloc(), there is no need
to call skb_set_owner_w() again, as this adds two atomic operations.
