net: dp83640: reinforce locking rules.

Callers of the ext_write function are supposed to hold a mutex that
protects the state of the dialed page, but one caller was missing the
lock from the very start, and over time the code has been changed
without following the rule.  This patch cleans up the call sites in
violation of the rule.
