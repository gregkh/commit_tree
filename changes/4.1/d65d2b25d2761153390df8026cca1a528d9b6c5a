staging: vt6655: vnt_tx_packet Correct TX order of OWNED_BY_NIC

The state of m_td0TD0.f1Owner should change after the buff_addr
has been filled otherwise the device grabs the buffer too early.

m_td0TD0.f1Owner is protected by memory barriers on both sides
of change.

iTDUsed is best incremented after MACvTransmit.

It appears that f1Owner actually polls to do the memory transfer.

A back port patch will be needed for v3.19
