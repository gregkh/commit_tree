spi: dw-spi: Convert 16bit accesses to 32bit accesses

Altera's Arria10 SoC interconnect requires a 32-bit write for APB
peripherals. The current spi-dw driver uses 16-bit accesses in
some locations. This patch converts all the 16-bit reads and
writes to 32-bit reads and writes.

Additional Documentation to Support this Change:
The DW_apb_ssi databook states:
"All registers in the DW_apb_ssi are addressed at 32-bit boundaries
to remain consistent with the AHB bus. Where the physical size of
any register is less than 32-bits wide, the upper unused bits of
the 32-bit boundary are reserved. Writing to these bits has no
effect; reading from these bits returns 0." [1]

Request for test with platforms using the DesignWare SPI IP.
