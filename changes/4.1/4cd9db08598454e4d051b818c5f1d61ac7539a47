ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Fix ruledata setup in davinci_mcasp_startup

Passing &mcasp->ruledata[dir] to snd_pcm_hw_rule_add() is not correct since
commit:
7b3d165a2821 ASoC: davinci-mcasp: Index ruledata in drvdata with substream->stream
now sets up the struct based on the substream->stream (0 or 1) while we pass
a pointer which we take with dir (1 or 2). This will lead kernel crash.
