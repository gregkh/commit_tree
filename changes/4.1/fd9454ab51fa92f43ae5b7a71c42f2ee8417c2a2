ARM: shmobile: r8a7779: Remove redundant cpu_disable implementation

By default only the non-boot CPUs can be hotplugged if the
smp_operations structure doesn't have the cpu_disable function
pointer set. r8a7779_cpu_disable() implements the same logic,
only non-boot CPUs can be hotplugged, so it's redundant to
override the default behavior.
