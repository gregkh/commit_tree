rcu: Refine diagnostics for lacking kthread for no-CBs callbacks

Some diagnostics under CONFIG_PROVE_RCU in rcu_nocb_cpu_needs_barrier()
assume that there can be no early-boot callbacks.  This commit therefore
qualifies the diagnostic with rcu_scheduler_fully_active to permit
early boot callbacks to avoid this splat.
