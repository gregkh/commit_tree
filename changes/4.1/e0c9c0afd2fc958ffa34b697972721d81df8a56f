mnt: Update detach_mounts to leave mounts connected

Now that it is possible to lazily unmount an entire mount tree and
leave the individual mounts connected to each other add a new flag
UMOUNT_CONNECTED to umount_tree to force this behavior and use
this flag in detach_mounts.

This closes a bug where the deletion of a file or directory could
trigger an unmount and reveal data under a mount point.
