ocfs2: fix possible uninitialized variable access

In ocfs2_local_alloc_find_clear_bits and ocfs2_get_dentry, variable
numfound and set may be uninitialized and then used in tracepoint.  In
ocfs2_xattr_block_get and ocfs2_delete_xattr_in_bucket, variable block_off
and xv may be uninitialized and then used in the following logic due to
unchecked return value.

This patch fixes these possible issues.
