vfio/platform: initial skeleton of VFIO support for platform devices

This patch forms the common skeleton code for platform devices support
with VFIO. This will include the core functionality of VFIO_PLATFORM,
however binding to the device and discovering the device resources will
be done with the help of a separate file where any Linux platform bus
specific code will reside.

This will allow us to implement support for also discovering AMBA devices
and their resources, but still reuse a large part of the VFIO_PLATFORM
implementation.
