Staging: sm750fb: provide error path for hw_sm750le_setBLANK()

This provides a default path for the switch statement in
hw_sm750le_setBLANK() so that the compiler will not correctly complain
about undefined values being sent to the hardware.

Instead, properly error out if the blank command is unknown by the
driver.
