clocksource/drivers/dw_apb_timers_of: Fix IO endianness causing time jumps

The dw_apb_timer_of timer is using __raw_readl() to access the
timer register, which is causing issues when the system is
running in big endian mode. Fix this by using readl_relaxed()
which should account for the endian settings.

This fixes issues where the time jumps around in the dmesg
output due to returnling __le32 values.

For an example, these two console lines show time running
backwards:

[   49.882572] CPU1: failed to come online
[   43.282457] Brought up 1 CPUs
