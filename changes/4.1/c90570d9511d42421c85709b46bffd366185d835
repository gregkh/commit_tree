PCI: Assign resources before drivers claim devices (pci_scan_bus())

Previously, pci_scan_bus() created a root PCI bus, enumerated the devices
on it, and called pci_bus_add_devices(), which made the devices available
for drivers to claim them.

Most callers assigned resources to devices after pci_scan_bus() returns,
which may be after drivers have claimed the devices.  This is incorrect;
the PCI core should not change device resources while a driver is managing
the device.

Remove pci_bus_add_devices() from pci_scan_bus() and do it after any
resource assignment in the callers.
