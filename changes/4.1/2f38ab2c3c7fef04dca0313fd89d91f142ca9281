mm: refactor do_wp_page, extract the page copy flow

In some cases, do_wp_page had to copy the page suffering a write fault
to a new location.  If the function logic decided that to do this, it
was done by jumping with a "goto" operation to the relevant code block.
This made the code really hard to understand.  It is also against the
kernel coding style guidelines.

This patch extracts the page copy and page table update logic to a
separate function.  It also clean up the naming, from "gotten" to
"wp_page_copy", and adds few comments.
