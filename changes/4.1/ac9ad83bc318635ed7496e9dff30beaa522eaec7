MIPS: prevent FP context set via ptrace being discarded

If a ptracee has not used the FPU and the ptracer sets its FP context
using PTRACE_POKEUSR, PTRACE_SETFPREGS or PTRACE_SETREGSET then that
context will be discarded upon either the ptracee using the FPU or a
further write to the context via ptrace. Prevent this loss by recording
that the task has "used" math once its FP context has been written to.
The context initialisation code that was present for the PTRACE_POKEUSR
case is reused for the other 2 cases to provide consistent behaviour
for the different ptrace requests.
