MIPS: Rearrange PTE bits into fixed positions.

This patch rearranges the PTE bits into fixed positions for R2
and later cores. In the past, the TLB handling code did runtime
checking of RI/XI and adjusted the shifts and rotates in order
to fit the largest PFN value into the PTE. The checking now
occurs when building the TLB handler, thus eliminating those
checks. These new arrangements also define the largest possible
PFN value that can fit in the PTE. HUGE page support is only
available for 64-bit cores. Layouts of the PTE bits are now:

   64-bit, R1 or earlier:     CCC D V G [S H] M A W R P
   32-bit, R1 or earler:      CCC D V G M A W R P
   64-bit, R2 or later:       CCC D V G RI/R XI [S H] M A W P
   32-bit, R2 or later:       CCC D V G RI/R XI M A W P
