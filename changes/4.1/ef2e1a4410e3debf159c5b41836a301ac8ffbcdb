staging/lustre/llite: Fix obd name after c&p error

commit 95745e9b1de2 ("staging: lustre: Use kasprintf.") introduced
a copy and paste error causing two different obd types to be assigned
same content causing lustre to fail on mount with a warning from procfs
followed by a bizzare error about OST not having enough MDS
capabilities.

This patch unbreaks Lustre client again.
