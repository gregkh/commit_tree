netfilter: x_tables: fix cgroup matching on non-full sks

While originally only being intended for outgoing traffic, commit
a00e76349f35 ("netfilter: x_tables: allow to use cgroup match for
LOCAL_IN nf hooks") enabled xt_cgroups for the NF_INET_LOCAL_IN hook
as well, in order to allow for nfacct accounting.

Besides being currently limited to early demuxes only, commit
a00e76349f35 forgot to add a check if we deal with full sockets,
i.e. in this case not with time wait sockets. TCP time wait sockets
do not have the same memory layout as full sockets, a lower memory
footprint and consequently also don't have a sk_classid member;
probing for sk_classid member there could potentially lead to a
crash.
