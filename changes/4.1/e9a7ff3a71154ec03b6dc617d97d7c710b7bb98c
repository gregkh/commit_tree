net/mlx4_core: Return the admin alias GUID upon host view request

Return the admin alias GUID value upon a GET request via HOST. We do this so
that the GUID value requested by the admin is returned even if the SM has not
yet approved this GUID (e.g. the SM is down).

Note that this does not create a problem, since the virtual port will remain
down until the SM does ACK the requested GUID value.
