ARM: at91/pm: standby mode uses same sram function as suspend to memory mode

To simply the PM code, the suspend to standby mode uses same sram function
as the suspend to memory mode, running in the internal SRAM, instead of the
respective code for each mode.

For the suspend to standby mode, the master clock doesn't switch to the slow
clock, and PLLA and the main oscillator doesn't turn off as well.
