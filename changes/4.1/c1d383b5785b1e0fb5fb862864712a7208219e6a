IB/core: dma map/unmap locking optimizations

Currently, while mapping or unmapping pages for ODP, the umem mutex is locked
and unlocked once for each page. Such lock/unlock operation take few tens to
hundreds of nsecs. This makes a significant impact when mapping or unmapping few
MBs of memory.

To avoid this, the mutex should be locked only once per operation, and not per
page.
