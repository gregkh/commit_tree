mm: tracing: Export enums in tracepoints to user space

The enums used in tracepoints with __print_symbolic() have their
names shown in the tracepoint format files and not their values.
This makes it difficult for user space tools to convert the binary
data to the strings as user space does not know what those enums
are about.

By having them use TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM(), the names of the enums will
be mapped to the values and shown to user space.
