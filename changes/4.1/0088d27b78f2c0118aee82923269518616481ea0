ath9k_htc: Add new USB ID

This device is a dongle made by Philips to enhance their TVs with wireless capabilities,
but works flawlessly on any upstream kernel, provided that the ath9k_htc module is attached to it.
It's correctly recognized by lsusb as "0471:209e Philips (or NXP) PTA01 Wireless Adapter" and the
patch has been tested on real hardware.
