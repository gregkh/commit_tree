staging: rtl8192e: Remove if conditions.

This patch removes if conditions with no exececutable
statements in the bodies of those ifs and also no variable
assignments in the if conditional checks. The call to
rtllib_act_scanning in the condition doesn't have any side
effects as it too performs conditional checks without changing
any values. Hence, it's safe to remove the if condition.
