time, drivers/rtc: Don't bother with rtc_resume() for the nonstop clocksource

If a system does not provide a persistent_clock(), the time
will be updated on resume by rtc_resume(). With the addition
of the non-stop clocksources for suspend timing, those systems
set the time on resume in timekeeping_resume(), but may not
provide a valid persistent_clock().

This results in the rtc_resume() logic thinking no one has set
the time and it then will over-write the suspend time again,
which is not necessary and only increases clock error.

So, fix this for rtc_resume().

This patch also improves the name of persistent_clock_exist to
make it more grammatical.
