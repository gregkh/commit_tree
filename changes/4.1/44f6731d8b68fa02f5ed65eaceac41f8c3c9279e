cdc_ncm: Fix tx_bytes statistics

The tx_curr_frame_payload field is u32. When we try to calculate a
small negative delta based on it, we end up with a positive integer
close to 2^32 instead.  So the tx_bytes pointer increases by about
2^32 for every transmitted frame.

Fix by calculating the delta as a signed long.
