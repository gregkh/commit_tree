nfsd4: disallow ALLOCATE with special stateids

vfs_fallocate will hit a NULL dereference if the client tries an
ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE with a special stateid.  Fix that.  (We also
depend on the open to have broken any conflicting leases or delegations
for us.)

(If it turns out we need to allow special stateid's then we could do a
temporary open here in the special-stateid case, as we do for read and
write.  For now I'm assuming it's not necessary.)
