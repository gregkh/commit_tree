target/user: Disallow full passthrough (pass_level=0)

TCMU requires more work to correctly handle both user handlers that want
all SCSI commands (pass_level=0) for a se_device, and also handlers that
just want I/O commands and let the others be emulated by the kernel
(pass_level=1). Only support the latter for now.

For full passthrough, we will need to support a second se_subsystem_api
template, due to configfs attributes being different between the two modes.
Thus pass_level is extraneous, and we can remove it.

The ABI break for TCMU v2 is already applied for this release, so it's
best to do this now to avoid another ABI break in the future.
