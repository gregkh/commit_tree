brcmfmac: Fix race condition in msgbuf ioctl processing.

Msgbuf is using a wait_event_timeout to wait for the response on
an ioctl. The wakeup routine uses waitqueue_active to see if
wait_event_timeout has been called. There is a chance that the
response arrives before wait_event_timeout is called, this
will result in situation that wait_event_timeout never gets
woken again and assumed result will be a timeout. This patch
removes that errornous situation by always setting the
ctl_completed var before checking for queue active.
