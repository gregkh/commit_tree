drivers: staging: iio: accel: Removed unnecessary variable

Variable len is used only to store the return value. Hence len is
removed and the return statement modified. Coccinelle was used to
detect such removable variables:

@rule1@
identifier ret;
expression e;
@@

-ret =
+return
           e;
-return ret;
