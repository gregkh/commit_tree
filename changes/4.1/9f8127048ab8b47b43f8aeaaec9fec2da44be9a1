ipmi: Fix a problem that messages are not issued in run_to_completion mode

start_next_msg() issues a message placed in smi_info->waiting_msg
if it is non-NULL.  However, sender() sets a message to
smi_info->curr_msg and NULL to smi_info->waiting_msg in the context
of run_to_completion mode.  As the result, it leads an infinite
loop by waiting the completion of unissued message when leaving
dying message after kernel panic.

sender() should set the message to smi_info->waiting_msg not
curr_msg.
