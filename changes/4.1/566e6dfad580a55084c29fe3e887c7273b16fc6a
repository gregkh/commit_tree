clocksource/drivers/arm_arch_timer: Rename 'arch_timer_probed()' to 'arch_timer_needs_probing()' to reflect behaviour

The arch_timer_probed() function returns whether the given time
doesn't need to be probed. This can be the case when the timer
has been probed already, but also when it has no corresponding
enabled node in DT.

Rename the function to arch_timer_needs_probing() and invert its
return value to better reflect the function's purpose and
behaviour.
