powerpc/mm: Fix infinite loop in hash fault with 4K page size

This is the same bug we fixed as part of 09567e7fd44291bfc08accfdd67ad8f467842332
("powerpc/mm: Check paca psize is up to date for huge mappings"). Please
check that for details. The difference here is that faults were
happening on a 4K page at an address previously mapped by hugetlb.
