mmc: tmio_mmc_dma: don't print invalid DMA cookie

The tmio_mmc_start_dma_{rx,tx} function functions contain debug
code that prints the dma cookie among other things. However,
in case we fall back to PIO mode for some reason, the cookie
variable is never initialized, and gcc warns about this:

In file included from ../include/linux/printk.h:277:0,
                 from ../include/linux/kernel.h:13,
                 from ../include/linux/list.h:8,
                 from ../include/linux/kobject.h:20,
                 from ../include/linux/device.h:17,
                 from ../drivers/mmc/host/tmio_mmc_dma.c:13:
../drivers/mmc/host/tmio_mmc_dma.c: In function 'tmio_mmc_start_dma':
../include/linux/dynamic_debug.h:86:3: warning: 'cookie' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   __dynamic_dev_dbg(&descriptor, dev, fmt, \
   ^
../drivers/mmc/host/tmio_mmc_dma.c:128:15: note: 'cookie' was declared here
  dma_cookie_t cookie;

This modifies the dev_dbg() statements so we only print the cookie
when we are already in the DMA path.
