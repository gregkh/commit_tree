ASoC: trace: fix printing jack name

After a change to the snd_jack structure, the 'name' member
is no longer available in all configurations, which results in a
build failure in the tracing code:

include/trace/events/asoc.h: In function 'trace_event_raw_event_snd_soc_jack_report':
include/trace/events/asoc.h:240:32: error: 'struct snd_jack' has no member named 'name'

The name field is normally initialized from the card shortname and
the jack "id" field:

        snprintf(jack->name, sizeof(jack->name), "%s %s",
                 card->shortname, jack->id);

This changes the tracing output to just contain the 'id' by
itself, which slightly changes the output format but avoids the
link error and is hopefully still enough to see what is going on.
