ncr5380: Remove NCR5380_local_declare and NCR5380_setup macros

The NCR5380_local_declare and NCR5380_setup macros exist to define and
initialize a particular local variable, to provide the address of the
chip registers needed for the driver's implementation of its
NCR5380_read/write register access macros.

In cumana_1 and macscsi, these macros generate pointless code like this,
	struct Scsi_Host *_instance;
	_instance = instance;

In pas16, the use of NCR5380_read/write in pas16_hw_detect() requires that
the io_port local variable has been defined and initialized, but the
NCR5380_local_declare and NCR5380_setup macros can't be used for that
purpose because the Scsi_Host struct has not yet been instantiated.

Moreover, these macros were removed from atari_NCR5380.c long ago and
now they constitute yet another discrepancy between the two core driver
forks.

Remove these "optimizations".
