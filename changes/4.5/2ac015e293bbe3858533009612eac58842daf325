thp: call pmdp_invalidate() with correct virtual address

Sebastian Ott and Gerald Schaefer reported random crashes on s390.
It was bisected to my THP refcounting patchset.

The problem is that pmdp_invalidated() called with wrong virtual
address. It got offset up by HPAGE_PMD_SIZE by loop over ptes.

The solution is to introduce new variable to be used in loop and don't
touch 'haddr'.
