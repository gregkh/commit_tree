lib/vsprintf.c: help gcc make number() smaller

One consequence of the reorganization of struct printf_spec to make
field_width 24 bits was that number() gained about 180 bytes.  Since
spec is never passed to other functions, we can help gcc make number()
lose most of that extra weight by using local variables for the field
width and precision.
