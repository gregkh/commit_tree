drivers/ide: make ide-scan-pci.c driver explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this support is currently:

config IDEPCI_PCIBUS_ORDER
        bool "Probe IDE PCI devices in the PCI bus order (DEPRECATED)"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets change the initcall to be the equivalent device_initcall, so that
when reading the driver code, there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Unlike other similar changes, we leave the module.h header to be
included since this code interacts with other drivers and needs to
know what a struct module is.
