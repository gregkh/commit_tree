KVM: x86: MMU: always set accessed bit in shadow PTEs

Commit 7a1638ce4220 ("nEPT: Redefine EPT-specific link_shadow_page()",
2013-08-05) says:

    Since nEPT doesn't support A/D bit, we should not set those bit
    when building the shadow page table.

but this is not necessary.  Even though nEPT doesn't support A/D
bits, and hence the vmcs12 EPT pointer will never enable them,
we always use them for shadow page tables if available (see
construct_eptp in vmx.c).  So we can set the A/D bits freely
in the shadow page table.

This patch hence basically reverts commit 7a1638ce4220.
