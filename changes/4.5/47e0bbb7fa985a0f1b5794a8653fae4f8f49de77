test: firmware_class: report errors properly on failure

request_firmware() failures currently won't get reported at all (the
error code is discarded). What's more, we get confusing messages, like:

    # echo -n notafile > /sys/devices/virtual/misc/test_firmware/trigger_request
    [ 8280.311856] test_firmware: loading 'notafile'
    [ 8280.317042] test_firmware: load of 'notafile' failed: -2
    [ 8280.322445] test_firmware: loaded: 0
    # echo $?
    0

Report the failures via write() errors, and don't say we "loaded"
anything.
