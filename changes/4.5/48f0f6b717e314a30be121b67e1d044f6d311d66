cxl: use correct operator when writing pcie config space values

When writing a value to config space, cxl_pcie_write_config() calls
cxl_pcie_config_info() to obtain a mask and shift value, shifts the new
value accordingly, then uses the mask to combine the shifted value with the
existing value at the address as part of a read-modify-write pattern.

Currently, we use a logical OR operator rather than a bitwise OR operator,
which means any use of this function results in an incorrect value being
written. Replace the logical OR operator with a bitwise OR operator so the
value is written correctly.
