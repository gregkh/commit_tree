bpf, x86: detect/optimize loading 0 immediates

When sometimes structs or variables need to be initialized/'memset' to 0 in
an eBPF C program, the x86 BPF JIT converts this to use immediates. We can
however save a couple of bytes (f.e. even up to 7 bytes on a single emmission
of BPF_LD | BPF_IMM | BPF_DW) in the image by detecting such case and use xor
on the dst register instead.
