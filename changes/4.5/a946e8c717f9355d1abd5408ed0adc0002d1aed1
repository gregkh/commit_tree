genirq: Delay incrementing interrupt count if it's disabled/pending

In case of a wakeup interrupt, irq_pm_check_wakeup disables the interrupt
and marks it pending and suspended, disables it and notifies the pm core
about the wake event. The interrupt gets handled later once the system
is resumed.

However the irq stats is updated twice: once when it's disabled waiting
for the system to resume and later when it's handled, resulting in wrong
counting of the wakeup interrupt when waking up the system.

This patch updates the interrupt count so that it's updated only when
the interrupt gets handled. It's already handled correctly in
handle_edge_irq and handle_edge_eoi_irq.
