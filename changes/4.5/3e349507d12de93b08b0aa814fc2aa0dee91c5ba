perf: Fix perf_enable_on_exec() event scheduling

There are two problems with the current perf_enable_on_exec() event
scheduling:

  - the newly enabled events will be immediately scheduled
    irrespective of their ctx event list order.

  - there's a hole in the ctx->lock between scheduling the events
    out and putting them back on.

Esp. the latter issue is a real problem because a hole in event
scheduling leaves the thing in an observable inconsistent state,
confusing things.

Fix both issues by first doing the enable iteration and at the end,
when there are newly enabled events, reschedule the ctx in one go.
