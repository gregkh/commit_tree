rfkill: fix rfkill_fop_read wait_event usage

The code within wait_event_interruptible() is called with
!TASK_RUNNING, so mustn't call any functions that can sleep,
like mutex_lock().

Since we re-check the list_empty() in a loop after the wait,
it's safe to simply use list_empty() without locking.

This bug has existed forever, but was only discovered now
because all userspace implementations, including the default
'rfkill' tool, use poll() or select() to get a readable fd
before attempting to read.
