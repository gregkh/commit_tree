ASoC: pxa: remove incorrect do_div() call

The new optimized do_div implementation (now in asm-generic/next) exposes a
glitch in the brownstone audio driver by producing a compile-time warning:

sound/soc/pxa/brownstone.c: In function 'brownstone_wm8994_hw_params':
sound/soc/pxa/brownstone.c:67:85: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
sound/soc/pxa/brownstone.c:67:10125: warning: right shift count >= width of type [-Wshift-count-overflow]
sound/soc/pxa/brownstone.c:67:10254: warning: passing argument 1 of '__div64_32' from incompatible pointer type [-Wincompatible-pointer-types]

The driver just divides two plain integer values, so it should not
use do_div to start with, but has apparently done so ever since the
code was first merged. This replaces do_div with a simple division
operator.
