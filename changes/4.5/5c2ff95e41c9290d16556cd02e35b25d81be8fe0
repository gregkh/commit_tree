numa: fix /proc/<pid>/numa_maps for hugetlbfs on s390

When working with hugetlbfs ptes (which are actually pmds) is not valid to
directly use pte functions like pte_present() because the hardware bit
layout of pmds and ptes can be different.  This is the case on s390.
Therefore we have to convert the hugetlbfs ptes first into a valid pte
encoding with huge_ptep_get().

Currently the /proc/<pid>/numa_maps code uses hugetlbfs ptes without
huge_ptep_get().  On s390 this leads to the following two problems:

1) The pte_present() function returns false (instead of true) for
   PROT_NONE hugetlb ptes. Therefore PROT_NONE vmas are missing
   completely in the "numa_maps" output.

2) The pte_dirty() function always returns false for all hugetlb ptes.
   Therefore these pages are reported as "mapped=xxx" instead of
   "dirty=xxx".

Therefore use huge_ptep_get() to correctly convert the hugetlb ptes.
