powerpc/powernv: Fix M64 resource name in /proc/iomem

The name of PCI root bus's M64 resource isn't initialized properly.
When dumping "/proc/iomem", "<BAD>" is seen for those M64 resources
on PCI root buses.

   ~# cat /proc/iomem | grep -e "BAD"
   3b0000000000-3b0fefffffff : <BAD>
   3b1000000000-3b1fefffffff : <BAD>
   3c0000000000-3c0fefffffff : <BAD>
   3c1000000000-3c1fefffffff : <BAD>
   3c2000000000-3c2fefffffff : <BAD>

This fixes the issue by setting the name of PCI root bus's M64
resource to that of PHB's device node full name. With the patch,
no "<BAD>" is seen from "/proc/iomem".
