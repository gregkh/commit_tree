pwm: lpss: Remove ->free() callback

The LPSS PWM driver calls pwm_lpss_disable() when the PWM device is
released (for example unexported from sysfs). This in turn calls
pm_runtime_put() which makes runtime PM count to be unbalanced if the
device has not been enabled at this point.

This is easy to reproduce:

  # cd /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0
  # echo 0 > export
  # echo 0 > unexport

The count is unbalanced and prevents the PWM device from being powered on
next time.

Fix this by removing ->free() callback. There are no resources to be
released anyway.
