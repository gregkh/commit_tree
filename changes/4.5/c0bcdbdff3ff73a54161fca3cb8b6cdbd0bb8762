ALSA: control: Avoid kernel warnings from tlv ioctl with numid 0

When a TLV ioctl with numid zero is handled, the driver may spew a
kernel warning with a stack trace at each call.  The check was
intended obviously only for a kernel driver, but not for a user
interaction.  Let's fix it.

This was spotted by syzkaller fuzzer.
