ftrace: Fix output of enabled_functions for showing tramp

When showing all tramps registered to a ftrace record in the file
enabled_functions, it exits the loop with ops == NULL. But then it is
suppose to show the function on the ops->trampoline and
add_trampoline_func() is called with the given ops. But because ops is now
NULL (to exit the loop), it always shows the static trampoline instead of
the one that is really registered to the record.

The call to add_trampoline_func() that shows the trampoline for the given
ops needs to be called at every iteration.
