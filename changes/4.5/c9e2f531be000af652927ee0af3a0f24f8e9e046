xen/scsiback: avoid warnings when adding multiple LUNs to a domain

When adding more than one LUN to a frontend a warning for a failed
assignment is issued in dom0 for each already existing LUN. Avoid this
warning by checking for a LUN already existing when existence is
allowed (scsiback_do_add_lun() called with try == 1).

As the LUN existence check is needed now for a third time, factor it
out into a function. This in turn leads to a more or less complete
rewrite of scsiback_del_translation_entry() which will now return a
proper error code in case of failure.
