clk: ti: omap5+: dpll: implement errata i810

Errata i810 states that DPLL controller can get stuck while transitioning
to a power saving state, while its M/N ratio is being re-programmed.

As a workaround, before re-programming the M/N ratio, SW has to ensure
the DPLL cannot start an idle state transition. SW can disable DPLL
idling by setting the DPLL AUTO_DPLL_MODE=0 or keeping a clock request
active by setting a dependent clock domain in SW_WKUP.

This errata impacts OMAP5 and DRA7 chips, so enable the errata for these.
