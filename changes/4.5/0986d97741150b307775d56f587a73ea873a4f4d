s390: fix DAT off memory access, e.g. on kdump

commit 204ee2c56431 ("s390/irqflags: optimize irq restore") optimized
irqrestore to really only care about interrupts and adapted the
remaining low level users. One spot (memcpy_real) was not touched,
though - fix it. Otherwise a kdump kernel will fail while reading
the old kernel. As we re-enable irqs with a non-standard function
we have to tell lockdep about that.
