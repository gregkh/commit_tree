fs: make quota/dquot.c explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

config QUOTA
        bool "Quota support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modularity so that when reading the
driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering gets bumped to one level earlier when we
use the more appropriate fs_initcall here.  However we've made similar
changes before without any fallout and none is expected here either.

We don't delete module.h because the code in turn tries to load other
modules as appropriate and so it still needs that header.
