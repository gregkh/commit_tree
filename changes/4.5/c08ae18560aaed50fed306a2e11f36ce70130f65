iio-light: Use a signed return type for ltr501_match_samp_freq()

The return type "unsigned int" was used by the ltr501_match_samp_freq()
function despite of the aspect that it will eventually return a negative
error code.
Improve this implementation detail by deletion of the type modifier then.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
