ACPICA: Events: Enhance acpi_ev_execute_reg_method() to ensure no _REG evaluations can happen during OS early boot stages

ACPICA commit 31178590dde82368fdb0f6b0e466b6c0add96c57

We can ensure no early _REG evaluations by ensuring the following rules in
acpi_ev_execute_reg_method():
1. If an address space handler is installed during early stage,
   _REG(CONNECT) evaluations are blocked. This is achieved using
   acpi_gbl_reg_methods_enabled which is renamed from
   acpi_gbl_reg_methods_executed.
2. If _REG(CONNECT) has never been evalauted for the region object,
   _REG(DISCONNECT) evaluations are blocked. This is achieved by a new
   region object flag: AOPOBJ_REG_CONNECTED.
Note that, after applying this patch, we can ensure _REG(DISCONNECT) is
always paired to _REG(CONNECT). Lv Zheng
