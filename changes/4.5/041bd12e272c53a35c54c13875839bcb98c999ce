Revert "workqueue: make sure delayed work run in local cpu"

This reverts commit 874bbfe600a660cba9c776b3957b1ce393151b76.

Workqueue used to implicity guarantee that work items queued without
explicit CPU specified are put on the local CPU.  Recent changes in
timer broke the guarantee and led to vmstat breakage which was fixed
by 176bed1de5bf ("vmstat: explicitly schedule per-cpu work on the CPU
we need it to run on").

vmstat is the most likely to expose the issue and it's quite possible
that there are other similar problems which are a lot more difficult
to trigger.  As a preventive measure, 874bbfe600a6 ("workqueue: make
sure delayed work run in local cpu") was applied to restore the local
CPU guarnatee.  Unfortunately, the change exposed a bug in timer code
which got fixed by 22b886dd1018 ("timers: Use proper base migration in
add_timer_on()").  Due to code restructuring, the commit couldn't be
backported beyond certain point and stable kernels which only had
874bbfe600a6 started crashing.

The local CPU guarantee was accidental more than anything else and we
want to get rid of it anyway.  As, with the vmstat case fixed,
874bbfe600a6 is causing more problems than it's fixing, it has been
decided to take the chance and officially break the guarantee by
reverting the commit.  A debug feature will be added to force foreign
CPU assignment to expose cases relying on the guarantee and fixes for
the individual cases will be backported to stable as necessary.
