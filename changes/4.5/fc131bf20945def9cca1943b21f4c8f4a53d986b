drm/i915: Don't trust CSR program memory contents

Replaces "drm/i915: Force loading of csr program at boot" in the old
series.

Previously we called blindly into intel_csr_load_program() and depended
on a check of whether the CSR program memory was cleared or not.
This check is not reliable and no longer needed since we fixed the
call-sites of intel_csr_load_program().
