tcp: do not set rtt_min to 1

There are some cases where rtt_us derives from deltas of jiffies,
instead of using usec timestamps.

Since we want to track minimal rtt, better to assume a delta of 0 jiffie
might be in fact be very close to 1 jiffie.

It is kind of sad jiffies_to_usecs(1) calls a function instead of simply
using a constant.
