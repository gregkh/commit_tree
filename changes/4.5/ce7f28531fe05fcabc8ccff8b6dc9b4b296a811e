mtd: omap_elm: print interrupt resource using %pr

When CONFIG_LPAE is set on ARM, resource_size_t is 64-bit wide
and we get a warning about an incorrect format string for printing
the interrupt number in elm_probe:

drivers/mtd/nand/omap_elm.c: In function 'elm_probe':
drivers/mtd/nand/omap_elm.c:417:23: warning: format '%i' expects argument of type 'int', but argument 3 has type 'resource_size_t {aka long long unsigned int}' [-Wformat=]

This patch avoids the type mismatch by printing the interrupt as
a resource using the %pr format string.
