drivers:hv: Export a function that maps Linux CPU num onto Hyper-V proc num

This patch exposes the mapping between Linux CPU number and Hyper-V virtual
processor number.  This is necessary because the hypervisor needs to know which
virtual processors to target when making a mapping in the Interrupt Redirection
Table in the I/O MMU.
