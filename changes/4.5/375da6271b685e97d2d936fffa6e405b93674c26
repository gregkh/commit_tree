usb: phy: Remove unused Renesas R-Car (Gen1) USB PHY driver

As of commit 3d7608e4c169af03 ("ARM: shmobile: bockw: remove legacy
board file and config"), the Renesas R-Car (Gen1) USB PHY driver is no
longer used.
In theory it could still be used on R-Car Gen1 SoCs, but that would
require adding DT support to the driver. Instead, a new driver using the
generic PHY framework should be written, as was done for R-Car Gen2.

Remove the driver for good.
