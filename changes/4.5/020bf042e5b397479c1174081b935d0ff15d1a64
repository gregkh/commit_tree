s390/dasd: prevent incorrect length error under z/VM after PAV changes

The channel checks the specified length and the provided amount of
data for CCWs and provides an incorrect length error if the size does
not match. Under z/VM with simulation activated the length may get
changed. Having the suppress length indication bit set is stated as
good CCW coding practice and avoids errors under z/VM.
