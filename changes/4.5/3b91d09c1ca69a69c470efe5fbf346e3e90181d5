scsi_transport_sas: add is_sas_attached() function

Adds a function designed to be callable any time (regardless of
whether the transport attributes are configured or not) which returns
true if the device is attached over a SAS transport.  The design of
this function is that transport specific functions can be embedded
within a

if (is_sas_attached(sdev)) {
	...
}

which would be compiled out (and thus eliminate the symbols) if SAS is
not configured.
