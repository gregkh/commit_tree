nvme: merge probe_work and reset_work

If we're using two work queues we're always going to run into races where
one item is tearing down what the other one is initializing.  So insted
merge the two work queues, and let the old probe_work also tear the
controller down first if it was alive.  Together with the better detection
of the probe path using a flag this gives us a properly serialized
reset/probe path that also doesn't accidentally trigger when two commands
time out and the second one tries to reset the controller while the first
reset is still in progress.
