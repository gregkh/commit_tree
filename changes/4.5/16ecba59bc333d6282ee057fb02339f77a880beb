e1000e: Do not read ICR in Other interrupt

Removes the ICR read in the other interrupt handler, uses EIAC to
autoclear the Other bit from ICR and IMS. This allows us to avoid
interference with Rx and Tx interrupts in the Other interrupt handler.

The information read from ICR is not needed. IMS is configured such that
the only interrupt cause that can trigger the Other interrupt is Link
Status Change.
