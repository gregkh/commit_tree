mips: define __smp_xxx

This defines __smp_xxx barriers for mips,
for use by virtualization.

smp_xxx barriers are removed as they are
defined correctly by asm-generic/barriers.h

Note: the only exception is smp_mb__before_llsc which is mips-specific.
We define both the __smp_mb__before_llsc variant (for use in
asm/barriers.h) and smp_mb__before_llsc (for use elsewhere on this
architecture).
