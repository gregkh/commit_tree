lwt: fix rx checksum setting for lwt devices tunneling over ipv6

the commit 35e2d1152b22 ("tunnels: Allow IPv6 UDP checksums to be
correctly controlled.") changed the default xmit checksum setting
for lwt vxlan/geneve ipv6 tunnels, so that now the checksum is not
set into external UDP header.
This commit changes the rx checksum setting for both lwt vxlan/geneve
devices created by openvswitch accordingly, so that lwt over ipv6
tunnel pairs are again able to communicate with default values.
