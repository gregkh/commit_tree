IB/qib: Support creating qps with GFP_NOIO flag

The current code is problematic when the QP creation and ipoib is used to
support NFS and NFS desires to do IO for paging purposes. In that case, the
GFP_KERNEL allocation in qib_qp.c causes a deadlock in tight memory
situations.

This fix adds support to create queue pair with GFP_NOIO flag for connected
mode only to cleanly fail the create queue pair in those situations.
