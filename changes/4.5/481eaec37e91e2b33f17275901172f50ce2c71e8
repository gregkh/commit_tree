tools/virtio: add ringtest utilities

This adds micro-benchmarks useful for tuning virtio ring layouts.
Three layouts are currently implemented:

- virtio 0.9 compatible one
- an experimental extension bypassing the ring index, polling ring
  itself instead
- an experimental extension bypassing avail and used ring completely

Typical use:

sh run-on-all.sh perf stat -r 10 --log-fd 1 -- ./ring

It doesn't depend on the kernel directly, but it's handy
to have as much virtio stuff as possible in one tree.
