NTB: Fix macro parameter conflict with field name

If the parameter given to the macro is replaced throughout the macro as
it is evaluated.  The intent is that the macro parameter should replace
the only the first parameter to container_of().  However, the way the
macro was written, it would also inadvertantly replace a structure field
name.  If a parameter of any other name is given to the macro, it will
fail to compile, if the structure does not contain a field of the same
name.  At worst, it will compile, and hide improper access of an
unintended field in the structure.

Change the macro parameter name, so it does not conflict with the
structure field name.
