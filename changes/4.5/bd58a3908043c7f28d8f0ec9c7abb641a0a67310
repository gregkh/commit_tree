dt-bindings: simplefb: Support regulator supply properties

The physical display tied to the framebuffer may have regulators
providing power to it, such as power for LCDs or interface conversion
chips.

The number of regulators in use may vary, but the regulator supply
binding can not be a list. Instead just support any named regulator
supply properties under the device node. These should be properly
named to match the device schematics / design. The driver should
take care to go through them all.
