ipv4: ipconfig: avoid unused ic_proto_used symbol

When CONFIG_PROC_FS, CONFIG_IP_PNP_BOOTP, CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP and
CONFIG_IP_PNP_RARP are all disabled, we get a warning about the
ic_proto_used variable being unused:

net/ipv4/ipconfig.c:146:12: error: 'ic_proto_used' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-variable]

This avoids the warning, by making the definition conditional on
whether a dynamic IP configuration protocol is configured. If not,
we know that the value is always zero, so we can optimize away the
variable and all code that depends on it.
