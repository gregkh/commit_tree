staging/rdma/hfi1: Consider VL15 MTU also when calculating the maximum VL MTU

Currently, only MTUs of VLs 0-7 are checked when calculating the maximum VL
MTU which is used to set the port MTU capability in DCC_CFG_PORT_CONFIG CSR
This can cause a port MTU capability to be set to 0 if MTUs of VLs 0-7 is 0
This would affect the VL15 traffic.
