blk-integrity: empty implementation when disabled

This patch moves the blk_integrity_payload definition outside the
CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INTERITY dependency and provides empty function
implementations when the kernel configuration disables integrity
extensions. This simplifies drivers that make use of these to map user
data so they don't need to repeat the same configuration checks.

Updated by Jens to pass an error pointer return from
bio_integrity_alloc(), otherwise if CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INTEGRITY isn't
set, we return a weird ENOMEM from __nvme_submit_user_cmd()
if a meta buffer is set.
