genirq: Free irq_desc with rcu

The new VMD device driver needs to iterate over a list of
"demultiplexing" interrupts. Protecting that list with a lock is not
possible because the list is also required in code pathes which hold
irq descriptor lock. Therefor the demultiplexing interrupt handler
would create a lock inversion scenario if it calls a demux handler
with the list protection lock held.

A solution for this is to free the irq descriptor via RCU, so the
list can be walked with rcu read lock held.
