mm/page_alloc.c: remove unnecessary parameter from __rmqueue

Commit 0aaa29a56e4f ("mm, page_alloc: reserve pageblocks for high-order
atomic allocations on demand") added an unnecessary and unused parameter
to __rmqueue.  It was a parameter that was used in an earlier version of
the patch and then left behind.  This patch cleans it up.
