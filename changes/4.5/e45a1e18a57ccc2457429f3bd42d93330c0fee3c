ARM: defconfig: use correct debug_ll settings

The debug-ll infrastructure can be configured in two ways, either
by selecting a platform specific debug option, or by picking one
of the generic options (8250 or pl01x typically). For compatibility
with multiplatform kernels, we have changed a couple of platforms
to use the former method now when they used to use the latter.

Unfortunately, this broke the defconfigs because now they still
enable CONFIG_DEBUG_LL_UART_PL01X or CONFIG_DEBUG_LL_UART_8250,
and we no longer configure the correct register addresses
automatically.

Embarrassingly, this was only found in linux-next when the
defconfig builds turned up errors for multiple people, and I
had not caught those in my own tests, which were done using
the randconfig fixes patchset on top, and that has a workaround
to avoid a build error when the addresses are not configured.

The error was something like:

.config:2010:warning: symbol value '' invalid for DEBUG_UART_PHYS
.config:2011:warning: symbol value '' invalid for DEBUG_UART_VIRT

This patch avoids the problem by removing the respective
statements from the defconfig files. Any out of tree defconfig
files on the platforms I have changed will have to do the same
change or run into the build error above. Any users that have
a full .config already set the correct DEBUG_UART_PHYS/VIRT
addresses and do not need to change anything.
