rtlwifi: rtl8723be: Fix module parameter initialization

This driver has a number of errors in the module initialization. These
include the following:

Parameter msi_support is stored in two places - one is removed.
Paramters sw_crypto and disable_watchdog were never stored in the final
locations, nor were they initialized properly.
