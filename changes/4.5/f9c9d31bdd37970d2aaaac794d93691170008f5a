i2c: rcar: refactor probe function a little

The probe function is a little bit messy, something here, something
there. Rework it so that there is some order: first init the private
structure, then the adapter, then do HW init. This also allows us to
remove the device argument of the clock calculation function, because it
now can be deduced from the private structure. Also, shorten some lines
where possible. This is a preparation for further refactoring.
