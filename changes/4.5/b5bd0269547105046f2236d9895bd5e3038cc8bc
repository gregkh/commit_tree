ACPI, PCI, irq: remove interrupt count restriction

Code currently supports 256 maximum interrupts at this moment. The patch is
reconfiguring the penalty array as a dynamic list to remove this
limitation.

A new penalty linklist has been added for all other interrupts greater than
16. If an IRQ is not found in the link list, an IRQ info structure will be
dynamically allocated on the first access and will be placed on the list
for further reuse. The list will grow by the number of supported interrupts
in the ACPI table rather than having a 256 hard limitation.
