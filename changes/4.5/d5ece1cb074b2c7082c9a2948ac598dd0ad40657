Fix ld-version.sh to handle large 3rd version part

The ld-version.sh script doesn't handle versions with large (>= 10) 3rd
version components, because the 2nd component is only multiplied by 10
times that of the 3rd component.

For example the following version string:
GNU ld (Codescape GNU Tools 2015.06-05 for MIPS MTI Linux) 2.24.90

gives a bogus version number:
 20000000
+ 2400000
+  900000 = 23300000

Breakage, confusion and mole-whacking ensues.

Increase the multipliers of the first two version components by a factor
of 10 to give space for a 3rd components of up to 99, and update the
sole user of ld-ifversion (MIPS VDSO) accordingly.
