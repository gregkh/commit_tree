gpio: sx150x: Be sure to clamp return value

As we want gpio_chip .get() calls to be able to return negative
error codes and propagate to drivers, we need to go over all
drivers and make sure their return values are clamped to [0,1].
We do this by using the ret = !!(val) design pattern.

This also starts to propagate the error code from the I2C
transaction as the end of the series adds support for that.
