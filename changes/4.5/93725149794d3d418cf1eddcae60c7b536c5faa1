net: qmi_wwan: MDM9x30 specific power management

MDM9x30 based modems appear to go into a deeper sleep when
suspended without "Remote Wakeup" enabled.  The QMI interface
will not respond unless a "set DTR" control request is sent
on resume. The effect is similar to a QMI_CTL SYNC request,
resetting (some of) the firmware state.

We allow userspace sessions to span multiple character device
open/close sequences.  This means that userspace can depend
on firmware state while both the netdev and the character
device are closed.  We have disabled "needs_remote_wakeup" at
this point to allow devices without remote wakeup support to
be auto-suspended.

To make sure the MDM9x30 keeps firmware state, we need to
keep "needs_remote_wakeup" always set. We also need to
issue a "set DTR" request to enable the QMI interface.
