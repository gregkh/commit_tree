fm10k: reinitialize queuing scheme after calling init_hw

The init_hw function may fail, and in the case of VFs, it might change
the number of maximum queues available. Thus, for every flow which
checks init_hw, we need to ensure that we clear the queue scheme before,
and initialize it after. The fm10k_io_slot_reset path will end up
triggering a reset so fm10k_reinit needs this change. The
fm10k_io_error_detected and fm10k_io_resume also need to properly clear
and reinitialize the queue scheme.
