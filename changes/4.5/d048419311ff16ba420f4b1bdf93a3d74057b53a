lib/vsprintf.c: expand field_width to 24 bits

Maurizio Lombardi reported a problem [1] with the %pb extension: It
doesn't work for sufficiently large bitmaps, since the size is stashed
in the field_width field of the struct printf_spec, which is currently
an s16.  Concretely, this manifested itself in
/sys/bus/pseudo/drivers/scsi_debug/map being empty, since the bitmap
printer got a size of 0, which is the 16 bit truncation of the actual
bitmap size.

We do want to keep struct printf_spec at 8 bytes so that it can cheaply
be passed by value.  The qualifier field is only used for internal
bookkeeping in format_decode, so we might as well use a local variable
for that.  This gives us an additional 8 bits, which we can then use for
the field width.

To stay in 8 bytes, we need to do a little rearranging and make the type
member a bitfield as well.  For consistency, change all the members to
bit fields.  gcc doesn't generate much worse code with these changes (in
fact, bloat-o-meter says we save 300 bytes - which I think is a little
surprising).

I didn't find a BUILD_BUG/compiletime_assertion/... which would work
outside function context, so for now I just open-coded it.
