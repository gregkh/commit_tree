IB/cma: Add configfs for rdma_cm

Users would like to control the behaviour of rdma_cm.
For example, old applications which don't set the
required RoCE gid type could be executed on RoCE V2
network types. In order to support this configuration,
we implement a configfs for rdma_cm.

In order to use the configfs, one needs to mount it and
mkdir <IB device name> inside rdma_cm directory.

The patch adds support for a single configuration file,
default_roce_mode. The mode can either be "IB/RoCE v1" or
"RoCE v2".
