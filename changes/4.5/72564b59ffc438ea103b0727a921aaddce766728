vxlan: Relax MTU constraints

Allow the MTU of vxlan devices without an underlying device to be set
to larger values (up to a maximum based on IP packet limits and vxlan
overhead).

Previously, their MTUs could not be set to higher than the
conventional ethernet value of 1500.  This is a very arbitrary value
in the context of vxlan, and prevented vxlan devices from being able
to take advantage of jumbo frames etc.

The default MTU remains 1500, for compatibility.
