documentation: Update RCU requirements based on expedited changes

Because RCU-sched expedited grace periods now use IPIs and interact
with rcu_read_unlock(), it is no longer sufficient to disable preemption
across RCU read-side critical sections that acquire and hold scheduler
locks.  It is now necessary to instead disable interrupts.  This commit
documents this change.
