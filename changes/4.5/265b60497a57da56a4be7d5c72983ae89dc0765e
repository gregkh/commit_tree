power: bq27xxx_battery: Fix bq27541 AveragePower register address

Currently in bq27541 driver, the average power register address is
incorrectly set to 0x76, which would result in an error:
bq27xxx-battery 2-0055: error reading average power register  10: -11
According to the bq27541 datasheet, fix this problem by setting
the average power register address to 0x24.
