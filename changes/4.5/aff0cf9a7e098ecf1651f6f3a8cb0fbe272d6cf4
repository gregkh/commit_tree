ncr5380: Fix trailing whitespace using regexp

This patch is the result of the following substitution. It removes any
tabs and spaces at the end of a line.

perl -i -pe 's,[\t ]+$,,' drivers/scsi/{atari_,}NCR5380.c

This removes some unimportant discrepancies between the two core driver
forks so that the important ones become obvious, to facilitate
reunification.
