PM / Domains: Fix potential deadlock while adding/removing subdomains

We must preserve the same order of how we acquire and release the lock for
genpd, as otherwise we may encounter deadlocks.

The power on phase of a genpd starts by acquiring its lock. Then it walks
the hierarchy of its parent domains to be able to power on these first, as
per design of genpd.

From a locking perspective this means the locks of the parents becomes
acquired after the lock of the subdomain.

Let's fix pm_genpd_add|remove_subdomain() to maintain the same order of
acquiring/releasing the genpd lock as being applied in the power on/off
sequence.
