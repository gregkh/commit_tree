ARM: OMAP2+: Improve omap_device error for driver writers

Drivers using pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() may not get disabled after
-EPROBE_DEFER. On the following device driver probe, hardware state
is different from the PM runtime state causing omap_device to produce
the following error:

omap_device_enable() called from invalid state 1

And with omap_device and omap hardware being picky for PM, this will
block any deeper idle states in hardware.

Let's add a proper error message so driver writers can easily fix
their drivers for PM.

In general, the solution is to fix the drivers to follow the PM
runtime documentation:

1. For sections of code that needs the device disabled, use
   pm_runtime_put_sync_suspend() if pm_runtime_set_autosuspend() has
   been set.

2. For driver exit code, use pm_runtime_dont_use_autosuspend() before
   pm_runtime_put_sync() if pm_runtime_use_autosuspend() has been
   set.

Let's not return with 0 from _od_runtime_resume() as that will
eventually lead into new drivers with broken PM runtime that will
block deeper idle states on omaps.
