ARM: OMAP: dmtimer: check for fixed timers during config

The omap_dm_timer_set_source() function provides a means for client
users to configure the mux parent for a GPTimer's functional clock.
However, not all timers are configurable (Eg: Timer12 on DRA7 is fed
by an internal 32k oscillator clock, and does not have configurable
parent clocks). So, check for such cases and proceed with out throwing
an error.
