iio:iio_buffer_init(): Only set watermark if not already set

Only initialize the watermark field if it is still 0. This allows drivers
to provide a custom default watermark value. E.g. some driver might have a
fixed watermark or can only support watermarks within a certain range and
the initial value for the watermark should be within this range.
