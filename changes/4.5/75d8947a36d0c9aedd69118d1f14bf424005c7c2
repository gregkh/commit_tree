zram: pass gfp from zcomp frontend to backend

Each zcomp backend uses own gfp flag but it's pointless because the
context they could be called is driven by upper layer(ie, zcomp
frontend).  As well, zcomp frondend could call them in different
context.  One context(ie, zram init part) is it should be better to make
sure successful allocation other context(ie, further stream allocation
part for accelarating I/O speed) is just optional so let's pass gfp down
from driver (ie, zcomp frontend) like normal MM convention.
