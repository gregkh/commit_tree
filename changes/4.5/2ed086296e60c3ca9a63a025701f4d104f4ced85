dmaengine: virt-dma: Add synchronization helper function

Add a synchronize helper function for the virt-dma library. The function
makes sure that any scheduled descriptor complete callbacks have finished
running before the function returns.

This needs to be called by drivers using virt-dma in their
device_synchronize() callback. Depending on the driver additional
operations might be necessary in addition to calling vchan_synchronize() to
ensure proper synchronization.
