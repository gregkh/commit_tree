spi: mediatek: Prevent overflows in FIFO transfers

In the case where transfer length is not a multiple of 4, KASAN
reports 2 out-of-bounds memory accesses:
 - mtk_spi_interrupt: ioread32_rep writes past the end of
   trans->rx_buf.
 - mtk_spi_fifo_transfer: iowrite32_rep reads past the end of
   xfer->tx_buf.

Fix this by using memcpy on the remainder of the bytes.
