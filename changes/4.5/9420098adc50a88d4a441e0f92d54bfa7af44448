Drivers: hv: utils: fix crash when device is removed from host side

The crash is observed when a service is being disabled host side while
userspace daemon is connected to the device:

[   90.244859] general protection fault: 0000 [#1] SMP

The problem is that hvutil_transport_destroy() which does misc_deregister()
freeing the appropriate device is reachable by two paths: module unload
and from util_remove(). While module unload path is protected by .owner in
struct file_operations util_remove() path is not. Freeing the device while
someone holds an open fd for it is a show stopper.

In general, it is not possible to revoke an fd from all users so the only
way to solve the issue is to defer freeing the hvutil_transport structure.
