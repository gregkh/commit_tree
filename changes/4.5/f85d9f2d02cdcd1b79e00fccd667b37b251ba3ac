drbd: fix "endless" transfer log walk in protocol A

Don't remember a DRBD request as ack_pending, if it is not.

In protocol A, we usually clear RQ_NET_PENDING at the same time we set
RQ_NET_SENT, so when deciding to remember it as ack_pending,
mod_rq_state needs to look at the current request state,
not at the previous state before the current modification was applied.

This should prevent advance_conn_req_ack_pending() from walking the full
transfer log just to find NULL in protocol A, which would cause serious
performance degradation with many "in-flight" requests, e.g. when
working via DRBD-proxy, or with a huge bandwidth-delay product.
