Make sure that highmem pages are not added to symlink page cache

inode_nohighmem() is sufficient to make sure that page_get_link()
won't try to allocate a highmem page.  Moreover, it is sufficient
to make sure that page_symlink/__page_symlink won't do the same
thing.  However, any filesystem that manually preseeds the symlink's
page cache upon symlink(2) needs to make sure that the page it
inserts there won't be a highmem one.

Fortunately, only nfs and shmem have run afoul of that...
