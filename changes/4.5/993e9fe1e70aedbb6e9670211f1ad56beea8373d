PM: APM_EMULATION does not depend on PM

The APM emulation code does multiple things, and some of them depend on
PM_SLEEP, while the battery management does not. However, selecting
the symbol like SHARPSL_PM does causes a Kconfig warning:

warning: (SHARPSL_PM && PMAC_APM_EMU) selects APM_EMULATION which has unmet direct dependencies (PM && SYS_SUPPORTS_APM_EMULATION)

From all I can tell, this is completely harmless, and we can simply allow
APM_EMULATION to be enabled here, even if PM is not.
