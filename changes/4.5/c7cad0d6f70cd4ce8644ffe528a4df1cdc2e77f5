tipc: move linearization of buffers to generic code

In commit 5cbb28a4bf65c7e4 ("tipc: linearize arriving NAME_DISTR
and LINK_PROTO buffers") we added linearization of NAME_DISTRIBUTOR,
LINK_PROTOCOL/RESET and LINK_PROTOCOL/ACTIVATE to the function
tipc_udp_recv(). The location of the change was selected in order
to make the commit easily appliable to 'net' and 'stable'.

We now move this linearization to where it should be done, in the
functions tipc_named_rcv() and tipc_link_proto_rcv() respectively.
