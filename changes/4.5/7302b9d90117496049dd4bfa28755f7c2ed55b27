ieee802154/adf7242: Driver for ADF7242 MAC IEEE802154

This driver has been sitting in the linux-zigbee[2] repository for a long
time. We updated it from time to time and made it available via our
github kernel repository. The Linux MAC802.15.4 support has improved a lot
since then. Thanks to all! So itâ€™s finally time to upstream this driver.

The ADF7242 requires an add-on firmware for the automatic IEEE 802.15.4
operating modes. The firmware file is currently made available on the
ADF7242 wiki page here [1]
