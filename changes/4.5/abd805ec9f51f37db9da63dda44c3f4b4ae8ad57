lightnvm: refactor rqd ppa list into set/free

A device may be driven in single, double or quad plane mode. In that
case, the rqd must have either one, two, or four PPAs set for a single
PPA sent to the device. Refactor this logic into their own
functions to be shared by program/erase/read in the core.
