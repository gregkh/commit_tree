livepatch: add sympos as disambiguator field to klp_reloc

In cases of duplicate symbols, sympos will be used to disambiguate instead
of val. By default sympos will be 0, and patching will only succeed if
the symbol is unique. Specifying a positive value will ensure that
occurrence of the symbol in kallsyms for the patched object will be used
for patching if it is valid. For external relocations sympos is not
supported.

Remove klp_verify_callback, klp_verify_args and klp_verify_vmlinux_symbol
as they are no longer used.

From the klp_reloc structure remove val, as it can be refactored as a
local variable in klp_write_object_relocations.
