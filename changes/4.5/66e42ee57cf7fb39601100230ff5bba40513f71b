ACPICA: Reduce regression fix divergence from upstream ACPICA

Linux has been fixed during 20151218 release cycle by reverting wrong code
in the following commit:
  ACPICA commit: 071eff738c59eda1792ac24b3b688b61691d7e7c
  Subject: Add per-table execution of module-level code, early region
           handlers
While upstream ACPICA fixes later in the following commit:
  ACPICA commit: bf6cfddb4784c349f781758981b207253b5a1252
  Subject: Fix for module-level-code regression introduced in 20151218

This results in the divergences and this patch is meant to reduce such
divergences. Lv Zheng.
