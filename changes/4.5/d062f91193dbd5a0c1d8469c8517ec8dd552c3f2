[media] media: new media controller API for device resource support

Add new media controller API to allocate media device as a
device resource. When a media device is created on the main
struct device which is the parent device for the interface
device, it will be available to all drivers associated with
that interface. For example, if a usb media device driver
creates the media device on the main struct device which is
common for all the drivers that control the media device,
including the non-media ALSA driver, media controller API
can be used to share access to the resources on the media
device. This new interface provides the above described
feature. A second interface that finds and returns the media
device is added to allow drivers to find the media device
created by any of the drivers associated with the device.
