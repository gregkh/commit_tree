tcp: avoid cwnd undo after receiving ECN

RFC 4015 section 3.4 says the TCP sender MUST refrain from
reversing the congestion control state when the ACK signals
congestion through the ECN-Echo flag. Currently we may not
always do that when prior_ssthresh is reset upon receiving
ACKs with ECE marks. This patch fixes that.
