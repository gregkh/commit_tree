serial: support 16-bit register interface for console

Currently, 8-bit (MMIO) and 32-bit (MMIO32) register interfaces are
supported for the 8250 console, but the 16-bit (MMIO16) is not.
The 8250 UART device on my board is connected to a 16-bit bus and
my main motivation is to use earlycon with it.
