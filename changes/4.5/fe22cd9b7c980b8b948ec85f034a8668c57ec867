printk: help pr_debug and pr_devel to optimize out arguments

Currently, pr_debug and pr_devel will not elide function call arguments
appearing in calls to the no_printk for these macros.  This is because
all side effects must be honored before proceeding to the 0-value
assignment in no_printk.

The behavior is contrary to documentation found in the CodingStyle and
the header file where these functions are declared.

This patch corrects that behavior by shunting out the call to no_printk
completely.  The format string is still checked by gcc for correctness,
but no code seems to be emitted in common cases.
