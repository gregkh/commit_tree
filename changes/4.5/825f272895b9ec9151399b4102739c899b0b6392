drm/i915: Cancel hangcheck before GPU is suspended

In order to avoid accessing GPU registers while GPU is suspended cancel
the hangcheck work before calling intel_suspend_complete which actually
puts the GPU to suspend. Otherwise hangcheck might do MMIO reads to a
suspended GPU.

Placement before intel_guc_suspend is imitated from i915_drm_suspend
which cancels the work at i915_gem_suspend, to keep the functions
similar.

On VLV systems, namely BYT, this was causing an error during runtime
suspend cycle:

[drm:vlv_check_no_gt_access [i915]] *ERROR* GT register access while GT waking disabled
