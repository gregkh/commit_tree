arm64: kasan: ensure that the KASAN zero page is mapped read-only

When switching from the early KASAN shadow region, which maps the
entire shadow space read-write, to the permanent KASAN shadow region,
which uses a zero page to shadow regions that are not subject to
instrumentation, the lowest level table kasan_zero_pte[] may be
reused unmodified, which means that the mappings of the zero page
that it contains will still be read-write.

So update it explicitly to map the zero page read only when we
activate the permanent mapping.
