ocfs2/dlm: do not insert a new mle when another process is already migrating

When two processes are migrating the same lockres,
dlm_add_migration_mle() return -EEXIST, but insert a new mle in hash
list.  dlm_migrate_lockres() will detach the old mle and free the new
one which is already in hash list, that will destroy the list.
