drm/i915: fix lookup_power_well for power wells without any domain

The current lookup code wouldn't find a power well if it's not in any
power domain. There wasn't any power wells before but an upcoming patch
will detach the power domains from power well#1 and the MISC IO power
wells, so fix things up accordingly.
