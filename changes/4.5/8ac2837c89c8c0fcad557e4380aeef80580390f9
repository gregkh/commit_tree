Revert "Merge branch 'vsock-virtio'"

This reverts commit 0d76d6e8b2507983a2cae4c09880798079007421 and merge
commit c402293bd76fbc93e52ef8c0947ab81eea3ae019, reversing changes made
to c89359a42e2a49656451569c382eed63e781153c.

The virtio-vsock device specification is not finalized yet.  Michael
Tsirkin voiced concerned about merging this code when the hardware
interface (and possibly the userspace interface) could still change.
