ALSA: pcm: Fix ioctls for X32 ABI

X32 ABI uses the 64bit timespec in addition to 64bit alignment of
64bit values.  This leads to incompatibilities in some PCM ioctls
involved with snd_pcm_channel_info, snd_pcm_status and
snd_pcm_sync_ptr structs.  Fix the PCM compat ABI for these ioctls
like the previous commit for ctl API.
