ACPI / utils: Add acpi_dev_present()

There's an idiom in use by 7 Linux drivers to detect the presence of a
particular ACPI HID by walking the namespace with acpi_get_devices().
The callback passed to acpi_get_devices() is mostly identical across
the drivers, leading to lots of duplicate code.

Add acpi_dev_present(), the ACPI equivalent to pci_dev_present(),
allowing us to deduplicate all that boilerplate in the drivers.
