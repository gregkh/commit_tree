clk: sunxi: Add CLK_OF_DECLARE support for sun8i-a23-apb0-clk driver

The APBS clock on sun9i is the same as the APB0 clock on sun8i. With
sun9i we are supporting the PRCM clocks by using CLK_OF_DECLARE,
instead of through a PRCM mfd device and subdevices for each clock
and reset control. As such we need a CLK_OF_DECLARE version of
the sun8i-a23-apb0-clk driver.

Also, build it for sun9i/A80, and not just for configurations with
MFD_SUN6I_PRCM enabled.
