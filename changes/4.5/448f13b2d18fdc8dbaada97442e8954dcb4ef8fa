perf top: Fix annotation on --stdio

The ui__has_annotation() inside perf_top__record_precise_ip() should be
removed since it returns true only for TUI (and when sort key has
symbol).  However the 'perf top --stdio' also supports annotation for a
symbol which was specified by 's' key action.

Actually it already does the necessary checks before calling the
function.  So it's ok to get rid of the check here.
