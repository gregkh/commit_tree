efi: include asm/early_ioremap.h not asm/efi.h to get early_memremap

The code in efi.c uses early_memremap(), but relies on a transitive
include rather than including asm/early_ioremap.h directly, since
this header did not exist on ia64.

Commit f7d924894265 ("arm64/efi: refactor EFI init and runtime code
for reuse by 32-bit ARM") attempted to work around this by including
asm/efi.h, which transitively includes asm/early_ioremap.h on most
architectures. However, since asm/efi.h does not exist on ia64 either,
this is not much of an improvement.

Now that we have created an asm/early_ioremap.h for ia64, we can just
include it directly.
