ASoC: pcm: allow delayed suspending request by users

If a device would like to use delayed suspending then PM
recommendation is to set ‘power.use_autosuspend’ flag. To allow
users to do so we need to change runtime calls in core to use
autosuspend counterparts.

For user who do not wish to use delayed suspend not setting the
device's ‘power.use_autosuspend’ flag will result in non-delayed
suspend even with these APIs which incidentally is also the default
behaviour, so only users will be impacted who opt in for this.
