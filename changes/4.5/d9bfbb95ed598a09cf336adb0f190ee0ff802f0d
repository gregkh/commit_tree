mmc: sdio: Fix invalid vdd in voltage switch power cycle

The 'ocr' parameter passed to mmc_set_signal_voltage()
defines the power-on voltage used when power cycling
after a failure to set the voltage.  However, in the
case of mmc_sdio_init_card(), the value passed has the
R4_18V_PRESENT flag set which is not valid for power-on
and results in an invalid vdd.  Fix by passing the card's
ocr value which does not have the flag.
