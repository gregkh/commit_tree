[media] drivers/staging/media/davinci_vpfe/vpfe_mc_capture.c: use correct structure type name in sizeof

Correct typo in the name of the type given to sizeof.  Because it is the
size of a pointer that is wanted, the typo has no impact on compilation or
execution.

This problem was found using Coccinelle (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/).  The
semantic patch used can be found in message 0 of this patch series.

[Replace sizeof(type) by sizeof(variable)]]
