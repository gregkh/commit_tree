drm/exynos: move dma_addr attribute from exynos plane to exynos fb

DMA address is a framebuffer attribute and the right place for it is
exynos_drm_framebuffer not exynos_drm_plane. This patch also introduces
helper function for getting dma address of the given framebuffer.

Changelog v2:
- use state->fb instead of plane->base.fb.
