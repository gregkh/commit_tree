ravb: clear RIC1 in init instead of stop

AVB-DMAC Receive FIFO Warning interrupt is not enabled, so it is not
necessary to disable the interrupt in ravb_close().
On the other hand, this patch disables the interrupt in ravb_dmac_init() to
prevent the possibility that the interrupt is issued by the state that
a boot loader left.
