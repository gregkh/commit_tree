ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Fix return of skl_get_queue_index

In unbind modules, the skl_get_queue_index() can return error
if the pin is dynamic and module is not bound yet. So instead
of returning error this check should return success as modules
is not yet bound. This will let the module be bound when connected
pipes are enabled and will bind this as well.

So change the return value to 0
