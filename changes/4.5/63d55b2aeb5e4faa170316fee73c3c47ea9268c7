Drivers: hv: vmbus: serialize process_chn_event() and vmbus_close_internal()

process_chn_event(), running in the tasklet, can race with
vmbus_close_internal() in the case of SMP guest, e.g., when the former is
accessing channel->inbound.ring_buffer, the latter could be freeing the
ring_buffer pages.

To resolve the race, we can serialize them by disabling the tasklet when
the latter is running here.
