iommu/arm-smmu: Use incoming shareability attributes in bypass mode

When we initialise a bypass STE, we memset the structure to zero and
set the Valid and Config fields to indicate that the stream should
bypass the SMMU. Unfortunately, this results in an SHCFG field of 0
which means that the shareability of any incoming transactions is
overridden with non-shareable, leading to potential coherence problems
down the line.

This patch fixes the issue by initialising bypass STEs to use the
incoming shareability attributes. When translation is in effect at
either stage 1 or stage 2, the shareability is determined by the
page tables.
