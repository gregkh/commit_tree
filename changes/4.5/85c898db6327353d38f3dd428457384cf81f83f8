module: clean up RO/NX handling.

Modules have three sections: text, rodata and writable data.  The code
handled the case where these overlapped, however they never can:
debug_align() ensures they are always page-aligned.

This is why we got away with manually traversing the pages in
set_all_modules_text_rw() without rounding.

We create three helper functions: frob_text(), frob_rodata() and
frob_writable_data().  We then call these explicitly at every point,
so it's clear what we're doing.

We also expose module_enable_ro() and module_disable_ro() for
livepatch to use.
