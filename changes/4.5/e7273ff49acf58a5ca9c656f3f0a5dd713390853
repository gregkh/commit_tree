ARM: 8488/1: Make IPI_CPU_BACKTRACE a "non-secure" SGI

Having IPI_CPU_BACKTRACE as SGI15 may not work if the kernel is
running in non-secure mode and that the secure firmware has
decided to follow ARM's recommendations that SGI8-15 should
be reserved for secure purpose.

Now that we are "only" using SGI0-6, change IPI_CPU_BACKTRACE
to use SGI7, which makes it more likely to work.
