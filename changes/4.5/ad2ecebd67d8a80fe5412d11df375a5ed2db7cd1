net: thunderx: Fix receive packet stats

Counting rx packets for every CQE_RX in CQ irq handler is incorrect.
Synchronization is missing when multiple queues are receiving packets
simultaneously. Like transmit packet stats use HW stats here.

Also removed unused 'cqe_type' parameter in nicvf_rcv_pkt_handler().
