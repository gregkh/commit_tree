PCI: imx6: Add support for active-low reset GPIO

We previously used of_get_named_gpio(), which ignores the OF flags cell, so
the reset GPIO defaulted to "active high." This doesn't work on the Toradex
Apalis SoM with Ixora base board, which has an active-low reset GPIO.

Use devm_gpiod_get_optional() instead so we pay attention to the active
high/low flag.  This also adds support for GPIOs described via ACPI.
