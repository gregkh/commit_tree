IRQCHIP: irq-pic32-evic: Add support for PIC32 interrupt controller

This adds support for the interrupt controller present on PIC32 class
devices. It handles all internal and external interrupts. This controller
exists outside of the CPU core and is the arbitrator of all interrupts
(including interrupts from the CPU itself) before they are presented to
the CPU.

The following features are supported:
 - DT properties for EVIC and for devices/peripherals that use interrupt lines
 - Persistent and non-persistent interrupt handling
 - irqdomain and generic chip support
 - Configuration of external interrupt edge polarity
