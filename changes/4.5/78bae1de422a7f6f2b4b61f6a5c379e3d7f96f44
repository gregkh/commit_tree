rtlwifi: rtl8821ae: Fix errors in parameter initialization

This driver failed to copy parameters sw_crypto and disable_watchdog into
the locations actually used by the driver. In addition, msi_support was
initialized three times and one of them used the wrong variable. The
initialization of parameter int_clear was moved so that it is near that
of the rest of the parameters.
