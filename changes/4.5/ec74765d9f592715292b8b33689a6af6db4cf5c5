ACPI / debugger: copy_to_user doesn't return errors

The copy_to/from_user() functions don't return error codes, they return
the number of bytes remaining.  We had intended to return -EFUALT here.
We actually have already checked access_ok() in an earlier function so
I don't think these functions will fail but let's fix it anyway.
