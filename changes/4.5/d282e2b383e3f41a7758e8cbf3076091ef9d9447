SCSI: initio: remove duplicate module device table

The initio driver has for many years had two copies of the
same module device table. One of them is also used for registering
the other driver, the other one is entirely useless after the
large scale cleanup that Alan Cox did back in 2007.

The compiler warns about this whenever the driver is built-in:

drivers/scsi/initio.c:131:29: warning: 'i91u_pci_devices' defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]

This removes the extraneous table and the warning.
