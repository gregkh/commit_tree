udp: properly support MSG_PEEK with truncated buffers

Backport of this upstream commit into stable kernels :
89c22d8c3b27 ("net: Fix skb csum races when peeking")
exposed a bug in udp stack vs MSG_PEEK support, when user provides
a buffer smaller than skb payload.

In this case,
skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr),
                                 msg->msg_iov);
returns -EFAULT.

This bug does not happen in upstream kernels since Al Viro did a great
job to replace this into :
skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_msg(skb, sizeof(struct udphdr), msg);
This variant is safe vs short buffers.

For the time being, instead reverting Herbert Xu patch and add back
skb->ip_summed invalid changes, simply store the result of
udp_lib_checksum_complete() so that we avoid computing the checksum a
second time, and avoid the problematic
skb_copy_and_csum_datagram_iovec() call.

This patch can be applied on recent kernels as it avoids a double
checksumming, then backported to stable kernels as a bug fix.
