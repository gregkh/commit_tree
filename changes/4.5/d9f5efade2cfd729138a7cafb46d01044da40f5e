dmaengine: usb-dmac: fix endless loop in usb_dmac_chan_terminate_all()

This patch fixes an issue that list_for_each_entry() in
usb_dmac_chan_terminate_all() is possible to cause endless loop because
this will move own desc to the desc_freed. So, this driver should use
list_for_each_entry_safe() instead of list_for_each_entry().
