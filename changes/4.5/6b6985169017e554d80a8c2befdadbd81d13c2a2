    drm/i915: Enable PCH FIFO underruns later on ILK/SNB/IVB

we can only enable fifo underrun reporting when using the fdi/lpt
after everything is set up and after a bit of waiting. The waiting
is required, enabling it right after enabling encoders will first trigger
an underrun on the pch and then, 1 frame later, an underrun on the
cpu. Two vblank waits after encoder enabling seems enough to curb it.

    drm/i915: Suppress spurious CPU FIFO underruns on ILK-IVB

we also need to make sure cpu fifo underrun reporting is disabled when
enabling the fdi rx/tx and pch transcoder&port. But somehow this is
only needed when enabling, not also when disabling.
