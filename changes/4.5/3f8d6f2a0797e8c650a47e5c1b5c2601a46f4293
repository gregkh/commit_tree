ses: fix discovery of SATA devices in SAS enclosures

The current discovery routines use the VPD 0x83 inquiry page to find
the device SAS address and match it to the end point in the enclosure.
This doesn't work for SATA devices because expanders (or hosts) simply
make up an endpoint address for STP and thus the address returned by
the VPD page never matches.  Instead of doing this, for SAS attached
devices, match by the direct endpoint address instead.
