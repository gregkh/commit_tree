ixgbe: Fix MDD events generated when FCoE+SRIOV are enabled

When FCoE is enabled with SR-IOV on the X550 NIC the hardware
generates MDD events.

This patch fixes these by setting the expected values in the
Tx context descriptors for FCoE/FIP frames and adding a flush
after writing the RDLEN register.
