tools lib bpf: Collect map definition in bpf_object

This patch collects more information from maps sections in BPF object
files into 'struct bpf_object', enables later patches access those
information (such as the type and size of the map).

In this patch, a new handler 'struct bpf_map' is extracted in parallel
with bpf_object and bpf_program. Its iterator and accessor is also
created.
