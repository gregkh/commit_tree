xen/blkback: separate ring information out of struct xen_blkif

Split per ring information to an new structure "xen_blkif_ring", so that one vbd
device can be associated with one or more rings/hardware queues.

Introduce 'pers_gnts_lock' to protect the pool of persistent grants since we
may have multi backend threads.

This patch is a preparation for supporting multi hardware queues/rings.
