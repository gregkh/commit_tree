[media] media: add macros to check if subdev or V4L2 DMA

As we'll be removing entity subtypes from the Kernel, we need
to provide a way for drivers and core to check if a given
entity is represented by a V4L2 subdev or if it is an V4L2
I/O entity (typically with DMA).

Drivers that create entities that don't belong to any defined subdev
category should use MEDIA_ENT_T_V4L2_SUBDEV_UNKNOWN.
