clk: add flag for clocks that need to be enabled on rate changes

Some clocks need to be enabled to accept rate changes. This patch adds a
new flag CLK_SET_RATE_UNGATE that lets clk_change_rate enable the clock
before trying to change the rate and disable it again afterwards.
This of course doesn't effect clocks that are already running at that
point, as their refcount will only temporarily increase.
