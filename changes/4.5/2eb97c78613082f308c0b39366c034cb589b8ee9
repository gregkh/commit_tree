iommu/io-pgtable-arm: Avoid dereferencing bogus PTEs

In the case of corrupted page tables, or when an invalid size is given,
__arm_lpae_unmap() may recurse beyond the maximum number of levels.
Unfortunately the detection of this error condition only happens *after*
calculating a nonsense offset from something which might not be a valid
table pointer and dereferencing that to see if it is a valid PTE.

Make things a little more robust by checking the level is valid before
doing anything which depends on it being so.
