bnx2x: fix crash on big-endian when adding VLAN

bnx2x crashes during the initialization of the 8021q module on ppc64.
The bug is a missing conversion from le32 in
bnx2x_handle_classification_eqe() when obtaining the cid value from
struct eth_event_data.

The fields in struct eth_event_data should all be declared as
little-endian and conversions added where missing.
