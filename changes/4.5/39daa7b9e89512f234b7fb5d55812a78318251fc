ftrace: Show all tramps registered to a record on ftrace_bug()

When an anomaly is detected in the function call modification code,
ftrace_bug() is called to disable function tracing as well as give any
information that may help debug the problem. Currently, only the first found
trampoline that is attached to the failed record is reported. Instead, show
all trampolines that are hooked to it.

Also, not only show the ops pointer but also report the function it calls.

While at it, add this info to the enabled_functions debug file too.
