GFS2: Update master statfs buffer with sd_statfs_spin locked

Before this patch, function update_statfs called gfs2_statfs_change_out
to update the master statfs buffer without the sd_statfs_spin held.
In theory, another process could call gfs2_statfs_sync, which takes
the sd_statfs_spin lock and re-reads m_sc from the buffer. So there's
a theoretical timing window in which one process could write the
master statfs buffer, then another comes along and re-reads it, wiping
out the changes.
