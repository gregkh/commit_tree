i40e: Fix Rx hash reported to the stack by our driver

If the driver calls skb_set_hash even with a zero hash, that
indicates to the stack that the hash calculation is offloaded
in hardware. So the Stack doesn't do a SW hash which is required
for load balancing if the user decides to turn of rx-hashing
on our device.

This patch fixes the path so that we do not call skb_set_hash
if the feature is disabled.
