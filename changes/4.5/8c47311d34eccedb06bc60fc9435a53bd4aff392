[media] em28xx: add Terratec Cinergy T XS (MT2060)

The Terratec Cinergy T XS is a DVB-T receiver with no analog TV tuner.
This patch adds support for the cards carrying the mt2060 tuner; it's
unclear whether there are cards sold under the same name which use a
different tuner.
As long as there are no reports of such cards, and indeed as long as
there are no working drivers for them, we assume that the USB device
[0ccd:0043] is carrying the mt2060 tuner.
