mtd: nand: denali: add missing nand_release() call in denali_remove()

Unregister the NAND device from the NAND subsystem when removing a denali
NAND controller, otherwise the MTD attached to the NAND device is still
exposed by the MTD layer, and accesses to this device will likely crash
the system.
