clocksource/drivers/timer_sun5i: Replace code by clocksource_mmio_init

The current code to initialize, register and read the clocksource is
already factored out in mmio.c via the clocksource_mmio_init function.

The only difference is the readl vs readl_relaxed.

Factor out the code with the clocksource_mmio_init function.
