ARM: dts: am57xx: cl-som-am57x: skip resetting ETH PHYs

ETH PHYs setup on CL-SOM-AM57X is established in U-Boot along with
bringing them out of reset. This is done by toggling GPIOs belonging
to GPIO2/3 controllers on AM57xx.

Skip resetting ETH PHYs, by adding "ti,no-reset-on-init" to GPIO2/3
controllers DT nodes.
