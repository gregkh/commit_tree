net: Rename NETIF_F_ALL_CSUM to NETIF_F_CSUM_MASK

The name NETIF_F_ALL_CSUM is a misnomer. This does not correspond to the
set of features for offloading all checksums. This is a mask of the
checksum offload related features bits. It is incorrect to set both
NETIF_F_HW_CSUM and NETIF_F_IP_CSUM or NETIF_F_IPV6 at the same time for
features of a device.

This patch:
  - Changes instances of NETIF_F_ALL_CSUM to NETIF_F_CSUM_MASK (where
    NETIF_F_ALL_CSUM is being used as a mask).
  - Changes bonding, sfc/efx, ipvlan, macvlan, vlan, and team drivers to
    use NEITF_F_HW_CSUM in features list instead of NETIF_F_ALL_CSUM.
