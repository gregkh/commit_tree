ALSA: fireworks: move mutex from function callees to callers

Currently, critical section is protected by mutex in functions of
fireworks_stream.c. Callers increments/decrements substreams counter
before calling the functions. Moving mutex to the callers code allows
to change type of the substeram counter from atomic_t to unsigned int.

This commit is a preparation for obsoleting usage of atomic_t for
substream counter.
