crypto: picoxcell - set [src|dst]_nents and nents as signed int

The unsigned int variables [src|dst]_nents and nents can be assigned
signed value (-EINVAL) from sg_nents_for_len().
Furthermore they are used only by dma_map_sg and dma_unmap_sg which wait
for an signed int, so they must be set as int.
