drbd: Backport the "status" command

The status command originates the drbd9 code base. While for now we
keep the status information in /proc/drbd available, this commit
allows the user base to gracefully migrate their monitoring
infrastructure to the new status reporting interface.

In drbd9 no status information is exposed through /proc/drbd.
