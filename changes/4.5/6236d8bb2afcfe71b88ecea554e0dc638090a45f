ALSA: ctl: Fix ioctls for X32 ABI

The X32 ABI takes the same alignment like x86-64, and this may result
in the incompatible struct size from ia32.  Unfortunately, we hit this
in some control ABI: struct snd_ctl_elem_value differs between them
due to the position of 64bit variable array.  This ends up with the
unknown ioctl (ENOTTY) error.

The fix is to add the compat entries for the new aligned struct.
