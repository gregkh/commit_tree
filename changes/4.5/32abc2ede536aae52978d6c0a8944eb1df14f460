tools lib traceevent: Fix output of %llu for 64 bit values read on 32 bit machines

When a long value is read on 32 bit machines for 64 bit output, the
parsing needs to change "%lu" into "%llu", as the value is read
natively.

Unfortunately, if "%llu" is already there, the code will add another "l"
to it and fail to parse it properly.
