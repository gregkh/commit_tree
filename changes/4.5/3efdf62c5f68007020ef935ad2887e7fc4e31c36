[media] media: use macros to check for V4L2 subdev entities

Instead of relying on media subtype, use the new macros to detect
if an entity is a subdev or an A/V DMA entity.

Please note that most drivers assume that there's just AV_DMA or
V4L2 subdevs. This is not true anymore, as we've added MC support
for DVB, and there are plans to add support for ALSA and FB/DRM
too.

Ok, on the current pipelines supported by those drivers, just V4L
stuff are there, but, assuming that some day a pipeline that also
works with other subsystems will ever added, it is better to add
explicit checks for the AV_DMA stuff.
