atari_NCR5380: Reset bus on driver initialization if required

Merge the bus reset code from NCR5380.c into atari_NCR5380.c. This allows
for removal of a lot of duplicated code conditional on the RESET_BOOT
macro (in the next patch).

The atari_NCR5380.c fork lacks the do_reset() and NCR5380_poll_politely()
routines from NCR5380.c, so introduce them. They are indispensible. Keep
the two implementations in sync.
