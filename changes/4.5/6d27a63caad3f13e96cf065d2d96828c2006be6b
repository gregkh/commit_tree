n_tty: Fix unsafe reference to "other" ldisc

Although n_tty_check_unthrottle() has a valid ldisc reference (since
the tty core gets the ldisc ref in tty_read() before calling the line
discipline read() method), it does not have a valid ldisc reference to
the "other" pty of a pty pair. Since getting an ldisc reference for
tty->link essentially open-codes tty_wakeup(), just replace with the
equivalent tty_wakeup().
