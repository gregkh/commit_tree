mmc: tegra: enable UHS-I modes

Keep the quirk bits, as Tegra30 and Tegra114 host have different levels
of support for UHS-I modes and so need different spare bits to be set,
but change the logic to be positive.

Tegra210 needs a different tuning sequence than Tegra30+. Disable
UHS modes until support for this is properly added.
