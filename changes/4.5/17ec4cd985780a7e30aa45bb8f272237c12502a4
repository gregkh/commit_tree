zram: don't call idr_remove() from zram_remove()

The use of idr_remove() is forbidden in the callback functions of
idr_for_each().  It is therefore unsafe to call idr_remove in
zram_remove().

This patch moves the call to idr_remove() from zram_remove() to
hot_remove_store().  In the detroy_devices() path, idrs are removed by
idr_destroy().  This solves an use-after-free detected by KASan.
