bpf: support ipv6 for bpf_skb_{set,get}_tunnel_key

After IPv6 support has recently been added to metadata dst and related
encaps, add support for populating/reading it from an eBPF program.

Commit d3aa45ce6b ("bpf: add helpers to access tunnel metadata") started
with initial IPv4-only support back then (due to IPv6 metadata support
not being available yet).

To stay compatible with older programs, we need to test for the passed
structure size. Also TOS and TTL support from the ip_tunnel_info key has
been added. Tested with vxlan devs in collect meta data mode with IPv4,
IPv6 and in compat mode over different network namespaces.
