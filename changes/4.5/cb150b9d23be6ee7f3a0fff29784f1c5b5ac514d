cfg80211/wext: fix message ordering

Since cfg80211 frequently takes actions from its netdev notifier
call, wireless extensions messages could still be ordered badly
since the wext netdev notifier, since wext is built into the
kernel, runs before the cfg80211 netdev notifier. For example,
the following can happen:

5: wlan1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST> mtu 1500 qdisc mq state DOWN group default
    link/ether 02:00:00:00:01:00 brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
5: wlan1: <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP>
    link/ether

when setting the interface down causes the wext message.

To also fix this, export the wireless_nlevent_flush() function
and also call it from the cfg80211 notifier.
