ACPICA: Add per-table execution of module-level code

ACPICA commit 071eff738c59eda1792ac24b3b688b61691d7e7c

Execute any module-level code after each ACPI table (DSDT or SSDT)
is loaded into the namespace (rather than after all AML tables have
been loaded).  This matches the behavior of other ACPI
implementations and is required to support BIOS code that
depends on this behavior.
