pinctrl: qcom: make PMIC drivers bool

commit ab4256cfeab91569e1d96e7f0014538fe0845259
"pinctrl: qcom: pmic-gpio/mpp: of_irq_count() == npins"
made the Qualcomm PMIC pin control drivers make use of
of_irq_count() which is not an exported function, making
modular builds fail.

Fix this by marking the drivers as compiled-in/bool.
