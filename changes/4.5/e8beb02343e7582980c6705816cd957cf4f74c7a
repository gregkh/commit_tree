[media] tda1004x: only update the frontend properties if locked

The tda1004x was updating the properties cache before locking.
If the device is not locked, the data at the registers are just
random values with no real meaning.

This caused the driver to fail with libdvbv5, as such library
calls GET_PROPERTY from time to time, in order to return the
DVB stats.

Tested with a saa7134 card 78:
	ASUSTeK P7131 Dual, vendor PCI ID: 1043:4862
