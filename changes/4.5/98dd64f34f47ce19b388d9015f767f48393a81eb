ARM: 8478/2: arm/arm64: add arm-smccc

Adds helpers to do SMC and HVC based on ARM SMC Calling Convention.
CONFIG_HAVE_ARM_SMCCC is enabled for architectures that may support the
SMC or HVC instruction. It's the responsibility of the caller to know if
the SMC instruction is supported by the platform.

This patch doesn't provide an implementation of the declared functions.
Later patches will bring in implementations and set
CONFIG_HAVE_ARM_SMCCC for ARM and ARM64 respectively.
