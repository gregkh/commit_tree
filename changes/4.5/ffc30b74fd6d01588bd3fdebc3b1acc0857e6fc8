component: track components via array rather than list

Since we now have an array which defines each component, maintain the
components to be bound in the array rather than a separate list.  We
also need duplicate tracking so we can eliminate multiple bind calls
for the same component: we preserve the list-based component order in
that the first match which adds the component determines its position.
