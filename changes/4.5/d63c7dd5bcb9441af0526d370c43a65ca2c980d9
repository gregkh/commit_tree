ipr: Fix out-of-bounds null overwrite

Return value of snprintf is not bound by size value, 2nd argument.
(https://www.kernel.org/doc/htmldocs/kernel-api/API-snprintf.html).
Return value is number of printed chars, can be larger than 2nd
argument.  Therefore, it can write null byte out of bounds ofbuffer.
Since snprintf puts null, it does not need to put additional null byte.
