Input: goodix - use "inverted_[xy]" flags instead of "rotated_screen"

The goodix touchscreen driver uses a "rotated_screen" flag for
systems on which the touchscreen is mounted rotated by 180
degrees with respect to the display.  With the addition of
support for the dt properties "touchscreen-inverted-x" and
"touchscreen-inverted-y", a separate "rotated_screen" flag
is not necessary anymore. This patch replaces it by setting
the inverted_x and inverted_y flags instead.
