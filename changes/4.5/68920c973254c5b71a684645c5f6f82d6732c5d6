net/mac80211/debugfs.c: prevent build failure with CONFIG_UBSAN=y

With upcoming CONFIG_UBSAN the following BUILD_BUG_ON in
net/mac80211/debugfs.c starts to trigger:

  BUILD_BUG_ON(hw_flag_names[NUM_IEEE80211_HW_FLAGS] != (void *)0x1);

It seems, that compiler instrumentation causes some code
deoptimizations.  Because of that GCC is not being able to resolve
condition in BUILD_BUG_ON() at compile time.

We could make size of hw_flag_names array unspecified and replace the
condition in BUILD_BUG_ON() with following:

  ARRAY_SIZE(hw_flag_names) != NUM_IEEE80211_HW_FLAGS

That will have the same effect as before (adding new flag without
updating array will trigger build failure) except it doesn't fail with
CONFIG_UBSAN.  As a bonus this patch slightly decreases size of
hw_flag_names array.
