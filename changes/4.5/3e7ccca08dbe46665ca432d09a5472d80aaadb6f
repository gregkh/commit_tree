staging/rdma/hfi1: don't cache "prescan head"

When HFI1_CAP_DMA_RTAIL is toggled off the "prescan head" can get out of sync
with the receive context's "head". This happens when, after prescan_rxq() newly
arrived packets are then received, and processed by an RX interrupt handler.
This is an unavoidable race, and to avoid getting out of sync we always start
prescanning at the current "rcd->head" entry.
