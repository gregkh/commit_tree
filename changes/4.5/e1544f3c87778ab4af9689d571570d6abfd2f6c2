batman-adv: increase BLA wait periods to 6

If networks take a long time to come up, e.g. due to lossy links, then
the bridge loop avoidance wait time to suppress broadcasts may not wait
long enough and detect a backbone before the mesh is brought up.
Increasing the wait period further to 60 seconds makes this scenario
less likely.
