perf hists: Do not skip elided fields when processing samples

If user gives a filter, perf marks the corresponding column elided and
omits the output.  But it should process and aggregates samples using
the field, otherwise samples will be aggregated as if the column was not
there resulted in incorrect output.

For example, I'd like to set a filter on native_write_msr_safe.  The
original overhead of the function is negligible.

  $ perf report | grep native_write_msr_safe
      0.00%  swapper  [kernel.vmlinux]  native_write_msr_safe
      0.00%  perf     [kernel.vmlinux]  native_write_msr_safe

However adding -S option gives different output.

  $ perf report -S native_write_msr_safe --percentage absolute | \
  > grep -e swapper -e perf
     51.47%  swapper  [kernel.vmlinux]
      4.14%  perf     [kernel.vmlinux]

Since it aggregated samples using comm and dso only.  In fact, the above
values are same when it sorts with -s comm,dso.

  $ perf report -s comm,dso | grep -e swapper -e perf
     51.47%  swapper  [kernel.vmlinux]
      4.14%  perf     [kernel.vmlinux]

This resulted in TUI failure with -ERANGE since it tries to increase
sample hit count for annotation with wrong symbols due to incorrect
aggregation.

This patch fixes it not to skip elided fields when comparing samples in
order to insert them to the hists.

Commiter note:

After the patch, with a different workloads:
