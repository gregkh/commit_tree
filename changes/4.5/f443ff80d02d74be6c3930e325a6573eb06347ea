serial: sh-sci: Correct SCIF type on RZ/A1H

The "renesas,scif" compatible value is currently used for the SCIF
variant in all Renesas SoCs of the R-Car and RZ families.  However, the
variant used in the RZ family is not the common "SH-4(A)" variant, but
the "SH-2(A) with FIFO data count register" variant, as it has the
"Serial Extension Mode Register" (SCEMR), just like on sh7203, sh7263,
sh7264, and sh7269.

Use the (already documented) SoC-specific "renesas,scif-r7s72100"
compatible value to differentiate.  The "renesas,scif" compatible value
can still be used as a common denominator for SCIF variants with the
"SH-4(A)" register layout (i.e. ignoring the SCEMR register).
Note that currently both variants are treated the same, but this may
change if support for the SCEMR register is ever added.
