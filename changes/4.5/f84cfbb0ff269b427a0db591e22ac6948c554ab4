Documentation/memory-barriers.txt: Fix ACCESS_ONCE thinko

In commit 2ecf810121c7 ("Documentation/memory-barriers.txt: Add
needed ACCESS_ONCE() calls to memory-barriers.txt") the statement
"Q = P" was converted to "ACCESS_ONCE(Q) = P".  This should have
been "Q = ACCESS_ONCE(P)".  It later became "WRITE_ONCE(Q, P)".
This doesn't match the following text, which is "Q = LOAD P".
Change the statement to be "Q = READ_ONCE(P)".
