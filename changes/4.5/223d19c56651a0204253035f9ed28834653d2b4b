[media] media-device: check before unregister if mdev was registered

Most media functions that unregister, check if the corresponding register
function succeed before. So these functions can safely be called even if a
registration was never made or the component as already been unregistered.

Add the same check to media_device_unregister() function for consistency.

This will also allow to split the media_device_register() function in an
initialization and registration functions without the need to change the
generic cleanup functions and error code paths for all the media drivers.
