vsprintf: kptr_restrict is okay in IRQ when 2

The kptr_restrict flag, when set to 1, only prints the kernel address
when the user has CAP_SYSLOG.  When it is set to 2, the kernel address
is always printed as zero.  When set to 1, this needs to check whether
or not we're in IRQ.

However, when set to 2, this check is unneccessary, and produces
confusing results in dmesg.  Thus, only make sure we're not in IRQ when
mode 1 is used, but not mode 2.
