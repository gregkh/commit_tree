ARM: dts: am335x/am57xx: replace gpio-key,wakeup with wakeup-source property

Commit 3efda00129bd ("ARM: dts: am335x: replace gpio-key,wakeup with
wakeup-source property") replaces all the legacy "gpio-key,wakeup" with
the unified  "wakeup-source" property to prevent any further copy-paste
duplication.

However couple of use of these legacy property sneaked in during the
merge window. This patch replaces them too.
