s390/diag: avoid lockdep recursion

The diagnose tracer will indirectly call back into the lockdep code
when lockdep does not expect it (arch_spinlock). This causes lockdep
to disable itself and therefore we don't have a working lock
dependency validator anymore.

This patch effectively disables tracing of diag 0x9c and 0x44 if
lockdep is enabled.  If however lockdep is enabled spinlocks are
mainly implemented using a trylock variant, which will not issue any
diag 0x9c or 0x44. So this change has hardly any effect on tracing
except when arch_spinlock and friends are explicitly used.
