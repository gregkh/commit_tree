s390/stacktrace: save full stack traces

save_stack_trace() only saves the stack trace of the current context
(interrupt or process context). This is different to what other
architectures like x86 do, which save the full stack trace across
different contexts.

Also extract a __save_stack_trace() helper function which will be used
by a follow on patch.
