perf tools: Fix mmap2 event allocation in synthesize code

perf_event__synthesize_mmap_events() issues mmap2 events, but the memory
of that event is allocated using:

 mmap_event = malloc(sizeof(mmap_event->mmap) + machine->id_hdr_size);

If path of mmap source file is long (near PATH_MAX), random crash would
happen. Should use sizeof(mmap_event->mmap2).

Fix two memory allocations.
