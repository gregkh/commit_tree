Drivers: hv: ring_buffer: eliminate hv_ringbuffer_peek()

Currently, there is only one user for hv_ringbuffer_read()/
hv_ringbuffer_peak() functions and the usage of these functions is:
- insecure as we drop ring_lock between them, someone else (in theory
  only) can acquire it in between;
- non-optimal as we do a number of things (acquire/release the above
  mentioned lock, calculate available space on the ring, ...) twice and
  this path is performance-critical.

Remove hv_ringbuffer_peek() moving the logic from __vmbus_recvpacket() to
hv_ringbuffer_read().
