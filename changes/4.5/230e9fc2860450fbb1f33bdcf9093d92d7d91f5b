slab: add SLAB_ACCOUNT flag

Currently, if we want to account all objects of a particular kmem cache,
we have to pass __GFP_ACCOUNT to each kmem_cache_alloc call, which is
inconvenient.  This patch introduces SLAB_ACCOUNT flag which if passed
to kmem_cache_create will force accounting for every allocation from
this cache even if __GFP_ACCOUNT is not passed.

This patch does not make any of the existing caches use this flag - it
will be done later in the series.

Note, a cache with SLAB_ACCOUNT cannot be merged with a cache w/o
SLAB_ACCOUNT, because merged caches share the same kmem_cache struct and
hence cannot have different sets of SLAB_* flags.  Thus using this flag
will probably reduce the number of merged slabs even if kmem accounting
is not used (only compiled in).
