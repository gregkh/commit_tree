s390/dasd: fix performance drop

Commit ca369d51b ("sd: Fix device-imposed transfer length limits")
introduced a new queue limit max_dev_sectors which limits the maximum
sectors for requests. The default value leads to small dasd requests
and therefor to a performance drop.
Set the max_dev_sectors value to the same value as the max_hw_sectors
to use the maximum available request size for DASD devices.
