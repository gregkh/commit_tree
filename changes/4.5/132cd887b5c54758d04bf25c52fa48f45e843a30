arm64: Modify stack trace and dump for use with irq_stack

This patch allows unwind_frame() to traverse from interrupt stack to task
stack correctly. It requires data from a dummy stack frame, created
during irq_stack_entry(), added by a later patch.

A similar approach is taken to modify dump_backtrace(), which expects to
find struct pt_regs underneath any call to functions marked __exception.
When on an irq_stack, the struct pt_regs is stored on the old task stack,
the location of which is stored in the dummy stack frame.
