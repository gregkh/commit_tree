rhashtable-test: retry insert operations

After adding cond_resched() calls to threadfunc(), a surprisingly high
rate of insert failures occurred probably due to table resizes getting a
better chance to run in background. To not soften up the remaining
tests, retry inserts until they either succeed or fail permanently.

Also change the non-threaded test to retry insert operations, too.
