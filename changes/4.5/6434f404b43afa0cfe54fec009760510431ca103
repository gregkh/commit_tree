drbd: fix refcount error during detach of an already failed disk

A D_FAILED disk transitions as quickly as possible to
D_DISKLESS. But in the "unresponsive local disk" case,
there remains a time window where a administrative detach command could
find the disk already failed, but some internal meta data IO against the
unresponsive local disk still pending.

In that case, drbd_md_get_buffer() will return NULL.
Don't unconditionally call drbd_md_put_buffer(), or it will cause
refcount imbalance, and prevent any further re-attach on this volume
(until it is deleted and re-created).
