ACPICA: Revert "Parser: Fix for SuperName method invocation"

ACPICA commit eade8f78f2aa21e8eabc3380a5728db47273bcf1

Revert commit ae90fbf562d7 (ACPICA: Parser: Fix for SuperName method
invocation).

Support for method invocations as part of super_name will be
removed from the ACPI specification, since no AML interpreter
supports it.
