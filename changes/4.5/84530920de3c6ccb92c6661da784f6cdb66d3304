perf pmu: fix alias->snapshot missing initialization bug

This patch fixes a bug in __perf_pmu__new_alias() whereby the
alias->snapshot field was not initialized to false. This led to random
alias->snapshot value for an alias and was breaking some measurements
such as:

  $ perf stat -a -e uncore_imc/data_reads/ -I 1000 sleep 100

Because the event ended up being treated as snapshot mode, when it is
not.
