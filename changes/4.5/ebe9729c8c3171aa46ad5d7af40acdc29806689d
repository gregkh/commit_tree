perf machine: Fix to destroy kernel maps when machine exits

Actually machine__exit forgot to call machine__destroy_kernel_maps.

This fixes some memory leaks on map as below.

Without this fix.
  ----
  ./perf probe vfs_read
  Added new event:
    probe:vfs_read       (on vfs_read)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

          perf record -e probe:vfs_read -aR sleep 1

  REFCNT: BUG: Unreclaimed objects found.
  REFCNT: Total 4 objects are not reclaimed.
     To see all backtraces, rerun with -v option
