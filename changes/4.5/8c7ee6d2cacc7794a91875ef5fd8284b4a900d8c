fm10k: Correct MTU for jumbo frames

Based on hardware testing, the host interface supports up to 15368 bytes
as the maximum frame size. To determine the correct MTU, we subtract 8
for the internal switch tag, 14 for the L2 header, and 4 for the
appended FCS header, resulting in 15342 bytes of payload for our maximum
MTU on jumbo frames.
