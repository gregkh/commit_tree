lightnvm: introduce nvm_submit_ppa

Internal logic for both core and media managers, does not have a
backing bio for issuing I/Os. Introduce nvm_submit_ppa to allow raw
I/Os to be submitted to the underlying device driver.

The function request the device, ppa, data buffer and its length and
will submit the I/O synchronously to the device. The return value may
therefore be used to detect any errors regarding the issued I/O.
