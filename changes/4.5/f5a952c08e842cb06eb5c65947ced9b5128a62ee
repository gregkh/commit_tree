of: of_mdio: Add marvell, 88e1145 to whitelist of PHY compatibilities.

Commit ae461131960b ("of: of_mdio: Add a whitelist of PHY
compatibilities.") missed one compatible string used in in-tree DTBs:
in OCTEON, for selected boards, the kernel DTB pruning code will overwrite
the DTB compatible string with "marvell,88e1145", which is missing
from the whitelist. Add it.

The patch fixes broken networking on EdgeRouter Lite.
