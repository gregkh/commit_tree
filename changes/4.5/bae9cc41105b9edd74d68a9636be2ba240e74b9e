perf list: Add support for PERF_COUNT_SW_BPF_OUT

When PERF_COUNT_SW_BPF_OUTPUT was added to the kernel we should've
added it to tools/perf, where it is used just to list events.

This ended up causing a segfault in commands like "perf list stall".

Fix it by adding that new software counter.

A patch to robustify perf to not segfault when the next counter gets
added in the kernel will follow this one.
