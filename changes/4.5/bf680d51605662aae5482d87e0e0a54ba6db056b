powerpc/mm: Don't track subpage valid bit in pte_t

This free up 11 bits in pte_t. In the later patch we also change
the pte_t format so that we can start supporting migration pte
at pmd level. We now track 4k subpage valid bit as below

If we have _PAGE_COMBO set, we override the _PAGE_F_GIX_SHIFT
and _PAGE_F_SECOND. Together we have 4 bits, each of them
used to indicate whether any of the 4 4k subpage in that group
is valid. ie,

[ group 1 bit ]   [ group 2 bit ]  ..... [ group 4 ]
[ subpage 1 - 4]  [ subpage 5- 8]  ..... [ subpage 13 - 16]

We still track each 4k subpage slot number and secondary hash
information in the second half of pgtable_t. Removing the subpage
tracking have some significant overhead on aim9 and ebizzy benchmark and
to support THP with 4K subpage, we do need a pgtable_t of 4096 bytes.
