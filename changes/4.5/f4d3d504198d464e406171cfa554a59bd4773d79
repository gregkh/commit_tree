mips: Differentiate between 32 and 64 bit ELF header

Depending on the configuration either the 32 or 64 bit version of
elf_check_arch() is defined. parse_crash_elf{32|64}_headers() does
some basic verification of the ELF header via
vmcore_elf{32|64}_check_arch() which happen to map to elf_check_arch().
Since the implementation 32 and 64 bit version of elf_check_arch()
differ, we use the wrong type:

   In file included from include/linux/elf.h:4:0,
                    from fs/proc/vmcore.c:13:
   fs/proc/vmcore.c: In function 'parse_crash_elf64_headers':
>> arch/mips/include/asm/elf.h:228:23: error: initialization from incompatible pointer type [-Werror=incompatible-pointer-types]
     struct elfhdr *__h = (hdr);     \
                          ^
   include/linux/crash_dump.h:41:37: note: in expansion of macro 'elf_check_arch'
    #define vmcore_elf64_check_arch(x) (elf_check_arch(x) || vmcore_elf_check_arch_cross(x))
                                        ^
   fs/proc/vmcore.c:1015:4: note: in expansion of macro 'vmcore_elf64_check_arch'
      !vmcore_elf64_check_arch(&ehdr) ||
       ^

Therefore, we rather define vmcore_elf{32|64}_check_arch() as a
basic machine check and use it also in binfm_elf?32.c as well.
