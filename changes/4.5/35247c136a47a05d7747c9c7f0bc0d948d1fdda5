extcon: arizona: Add device binding for second jack detect pin on GPIO5

Some Arizona devices have the option to use the GPIO5 pin as a second
jack detection pin. This patch adds device bindings to specify to the
driver that it should use this pin. Note that the second jack detection
pin is hard wired in the chip so can only be enabled through the
binding, rather than a pin being specified.
