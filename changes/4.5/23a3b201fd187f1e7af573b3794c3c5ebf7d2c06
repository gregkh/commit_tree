kvm/x86: Hyper-V fix SynIC timer disabling condition

Hypervisor Function Specification(HFS) doesn't require
to disable SynIC timer at timer config write if timer->count = 0.

So drop this check, this allow to load timers MSR's
during migration restore, because config are set before count
in QEMU side.

Also fix condition according to HFS doc(15.3.1):
"It is not permitted to set the SINTx field to zero for an
enabled timer. If attempted, the timer will be
marked disabled (that is, bit 0 cleared) immediately."
