cpufreq: pcc-cpufreq: update default value of cpuinfo_transition_latency

The cpufreq documentation specifies

policy->cpuinfo.transition_latency   the time it takes on this CPU to
                                switch between two frequencies in
                                nanoseconds (if appropriate, else
                                specify CPUFREQ_ETERNAL)

currently pcc-cpufreq does not expose the value and sets it to zero. I
changed the pcc-cpufreq driver and it's documentation to conform to the
default value specified in Documentation/cpu-freq/cpu-drivers.txt
