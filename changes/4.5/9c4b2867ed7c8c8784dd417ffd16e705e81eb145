cpuidle: menu: Fix menu_select() for CPUIDLE_DRIVER_STATE_START == 0

Commit a9ceb78bc75c (cpuidle,menu: use interactivity_req to disable
polling) exposed a bug in menu_select() causing it to return -1
on systems with CPUIDLE_DRIVER_STATE_START equal to zero, although
it should have returned 0.  As a result, idle states are not entered
by CPUs on those systems.

Namely, on the systems in question data->last_state_idx is initially
equal to -1 and the above commit modified the condition that would
have caused it to be changed to 0 to be less likely to trigger which
exposed the problem.  However, setting data->last_state_idx initially
to -1 doesn't make sense at all and on the affected systems it should
always be set to CPUIDLE_DRIVER_STATE_START (ie. 0) unconditionally,
so make that happen.
