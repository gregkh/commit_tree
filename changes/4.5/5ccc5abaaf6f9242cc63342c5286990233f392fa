mm: free swap cache aggressively if memcg swap is full

Swap cache pages are freed aggressively if swap is nearly full (>50%
currently), because otherwise we are likely to stop scanning anonymous
when we near the swap limit even if there is plenty of freeable swap cache
pages.  We should follow the same trend in case of memory cgroup, which
has its own swap limit.
