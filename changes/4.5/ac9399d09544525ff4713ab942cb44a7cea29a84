ncr5380: Always escalate bad target time-out in NCR5380_select()

Remove the restart_select and targets_present variables introduced in
Linux v1.1.38. The former was used only for a questionable debug printk
and the latter "so we can call a select failure a retryable condition".
Well, retrying select failure in general is a different problem to a
target that doesn't assert BSY. We need to handle these two cases
differently; the latter case can be left to the SCSI ML.
