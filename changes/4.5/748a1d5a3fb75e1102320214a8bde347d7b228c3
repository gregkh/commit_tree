ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add DMA resume position in Trigger resume/suspend

Use the DMA resume capability to resume the DMA position when
stream is suspended/resumed.

In suspend we save the position and when stream is resumed the stream needs
to be started from the position when the stream was suspended using the new
DMA resume capabilities
