xen/blkfront: pseudo support for multi hardware queues/rings

Preparatory patch for multiple hardware queues (rings). The number of
rings is unconditionally set to 1, larger number will be enabled in
patch "xen/blkfront: negotiate number of queues/rings to be used with backend"
so as to make review easier.

Note that blkfront_gather_backend_features does not call
blkfront_setup_indirect anymore (as that needs to be done per ring).
That means that in blkif_recover/blkif_connect we have to do it in a loop
(bounded by nr_rings).
