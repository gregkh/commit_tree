dmaengine: mv_xor: add suspend/resume support

This commit adds suspend/resume support to the mv_xor driver. The
config and interrupt mask registers must be saved and restored, and
upon resume, the MBus windows configuration must also be done again.

Tested on Armada 388 GP, with a RAID 5 array, accessed before and
after a suspend to RAM cycle.

Based on work from Ofer Heifetz and Lior Amsalem.
