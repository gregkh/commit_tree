ext4: move unlocked dio protection from ext4_alloc_file_blocks()

Currently ext4_alloc_file_blocks() was handling protection against
unlocked DIO. However we now need to sometimes call it under i_mmap_sem
and sometimes not and DIO protection ranks above it (although strictly
speaking this cannot currently create any deadlocks). Also
ext4_zero_range() was actually getting & releasing unlocked DIO
protection twice in some cases. Luckily it didn't introduce any real bug
but it was a land mine waiting to be stepped on.  So move DIO protection
out from ext4_alloc_file_blocks() into the two callsites.
