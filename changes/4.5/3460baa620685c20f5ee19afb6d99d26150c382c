PCI: Fix minimum allocation address overwrite

Commit 36e097a8a297 ("PCI: Split out bridge window override of minimum
allocation address") claimed to do no functional changes but unfortunately
did: The "min" variable is altered.  At least the AVM A1 PCMCIA adapter was
no longer detected, breaking ISDN operation.

Use a local copy of "min" to restore the previous behaviour.
