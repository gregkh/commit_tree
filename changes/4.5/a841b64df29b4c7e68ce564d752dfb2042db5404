XFS: Use a signed return type for suffix_kstrtoint()

The return type "unsigned long" was used by the suffix_kstrtoint()
function even though it will eventually return a negative error code.
Improve this implementation detail by using the type "int" instead.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
