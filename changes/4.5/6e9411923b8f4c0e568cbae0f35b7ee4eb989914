mtd: nand: return consistent error codes in ecc.correct() implementations

The error code returned by the ecc.correct() are not consistent over the
all implementations.

Document the expected behavior in include/linux/mtd/nand.h and fix
offending implementations.

[Brian: this looks like a bugfix for the ECC reporting in the bf5xx_nand
driver, but we haven't seen any testing results for it]
