ACPICA: Fix SyncLevel support interaction with method auto-serialization

ACPICA commit 253e3c03efc1a495d2aa61eee09ab1d0842a3dce

The control method auto-serialization can interfere with existing
ASL code that makes use of Mutex/Method SyncLevel support. This
change makes the auto-serialization transparent to the SyncLevel
support and management. David Box.
