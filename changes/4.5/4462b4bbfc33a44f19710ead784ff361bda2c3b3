clk: gpio: Really allow an optional clock= DT property

We mis-merged the original patch from Russell here and so the
patch went almost all the way, except that we still failed to
probe when there wasn't a clocks property in the DT node. Allow
that case by making a negative value from
of_clk_get_parent_count() into "no parents", like the original
patch did.
