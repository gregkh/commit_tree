i2c: mediatek: add i2c first write then read optimization

For platform with auto restart support, between every transfer,
i2c controller will trigger an interrupt and SW need to handle
it to start new transfer. When doing write-then-read transfer,
instead of restart mechanism, using WRRD mode to have controller
send both transfer in one request to reduce latency.
