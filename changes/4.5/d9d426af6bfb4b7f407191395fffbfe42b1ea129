be2net: fix VF link state transition from disabled to auto

The VF link state setting transition from "disable" to "auto" does not work
due to a bug in SET_LOGICAL_LINK_CONFIG_V1 cmd in FW. This issue could not
be fixed in FW due to some backward compatibility issues it causes with
some released drivers. The issue has been fixed by introducing a new
version (v2) of the cmd from 10.6 FW onwards. In v2, to set the VF link
state to auto, both PLINK_ENABLE and PLINK_TRACK bits have to be set to 1.

The VF link state setting feature now works on Lancer chips too from
FW ver 10.6.315.0 onwards.
