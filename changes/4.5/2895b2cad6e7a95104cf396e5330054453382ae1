dmaengine: dw: fix cyclic transfer callbacks

Cyclic transfer callbacks rely on block completion interrupts which were
disabled in commit ff7b05f29fd4 ("dmaengine/dw_dmac: Don't handle block
interrupts").  This re-enables block interrupts so the cyclic callbacks
can work.  Other transfer types are not affected as they set the INT_EN
bit only on the last block.
