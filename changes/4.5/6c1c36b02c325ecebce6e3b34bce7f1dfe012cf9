net/ipv4/ipconfig: Rejoin broken lines in console output

Commit 09605cc12c078306 ("net ipv4: use preferred log methods") replaced
a few calls of pr_cont() after a console print without a trailing
newline by pr_info(), causing lines to be split during IP
autoconfiguration, like:

    .
    ,
     OK
    IP-Config: Got DHCP answer from 192.168.97.254,
    my address is 192.168.97.44

Convert these back to using pr_cont(), so it prints again:

    ., OK
    IP-Config: Got DHCP answer from 192.168.97.254, my address is 192.168.97.44

Absorb the printing of "my address ..." into the previous call to
pr_info(), as there's no reason to use a continuation there.

Convert one more pr_info() to print nameservers while we're at it.
