ARCv2: Elide sending new cross core intr if receiver didn't ack prev

ARConnect/MCIP IPI sending has a retry-wait loop in case caller had
not seen a previous such interrupt. Turns out that it is not needed at
all. Linux cross core calling allows coalescing multiple IPIs to same
receiver - it is fine as long as there is one.

This logic is built into upper layer already, at a higher level of
abstraction. ipi_send_msg_one() sets the actual msg payload, but it only
calls MCIP IPI sending if msg holder was empty (using
atomic-set-new-and-get-old construct). Thus it is unlikely that the
retry-wait looping was ever getting exercised at all.
