crypto: caam - make write transactions bufferable on PPC platforms

Previous change (see "Fixes" tag) to the MCFGR register
clears AWCACHE[0] ("bufferable" AXI3 attribute) (which is "1" at POR).

This makes all writes non-bufferable, causing a ~ 5% performance drop
for PPC-based platforms.

Rework previous change such that MCFGR[AWCACHE]=4'b0011
(bufferable + cacheable) for all platforms.
Note: For ARM-based platforms, AWCACHE[0] is ignored
by the interconnect IP.
