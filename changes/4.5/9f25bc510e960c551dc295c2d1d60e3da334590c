tty: amba-pl011: prepare REG_* register indexes

Prepare for REG_* register accessors.  This change involves introducing
pl011_reg_to_offset() to convert REG_* to the hardware register offset,
and converting all call sites to use REG_* names.  We need to fix up
locations where we check for equivalence of register offsets as well.

Much of this change was made via these sed expressions:
s/ST_UART01[1x]\(_[^_]*\|_LCRH_[TR]X\)\>/REG_ST\1/
s/UART01[1x]_\(DR\|RSR\|ECR\|FR\|ILPR\|[IF]BRD\|LCRH\|CR\|IFLS\|IMSC\|RIS\|MIS\|ICR\|DMACR\)\>/REG_\1/g
