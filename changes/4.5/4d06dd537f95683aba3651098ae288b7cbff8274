cdc_ncm: do not call usbnet_link_change from cdc_ncm_bind

usbnet_link_change will call schedule_work and should be
avoided if bind is failing. Otherwise we will end up with
scheduled work referring to a netdev which has gone away.

Instead of making the call conditional, we can just defer
it to usbnet_probe, using the driver_info flag made for
this purpose.
