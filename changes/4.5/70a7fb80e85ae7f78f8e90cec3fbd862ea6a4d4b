regulator: core: Fix nested locking of supplies

Commit fa731ac7ea04 ("regulator: core: avoid unused variable warning")
introduced a subtle change in how supplies are locked. Where previously
code was always locking the regulator of the current iteration, the new
implementation only locks the regulator if it has a supply. For any
given power tree that means that the root will never get locked.

On the other hand the regulator_unlock_supply() will still release all
the locks, which in turn causes the lock debugging code to warn about a
mutex being unlocked which wasn't locked.
