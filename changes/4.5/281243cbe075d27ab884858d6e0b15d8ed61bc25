arm64: KVM: debug: Remove spurious inline attributes

The debug trapping code is pretty heavy on the "inline" attribute,
but most functions are actually referenced in the sysreg tables,
making the inlining imposible.

Removing the useless inline qualifier seems the right thing to do,
having verified that the output code is similar.
