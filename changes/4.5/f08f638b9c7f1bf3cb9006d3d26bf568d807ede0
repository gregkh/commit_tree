cpufreq: ondemand: update update_sampling_rate() to make it more efficient

Currently update_sampling_rate() runs over each online CPU and
cancels/queues timers on all policy->cpus every time. This should be
done just once for any cpu belonging to a policy.

Create a cpumask and keep on clearing it as and when we process
policies, so that we don't have to traverse through all CPUs of the same
policy.
