drivers:hv: Export the API to invoke a hypercall on Hyper-V

This patch exposes the function that hv_vmbus.ko uses to make hypercalls.  This
is necessary for retargeting an interrupt when it is given a new affinity.

Since we are exporting this API, rename the API as it will be visible outside
the hv.c file.
