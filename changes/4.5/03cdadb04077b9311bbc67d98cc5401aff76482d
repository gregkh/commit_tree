block: disable block device DAX by default

The recent *sync enabling discovered that we are inserting into the
block_device pagecache counter to the expectations of the dirty data
tracking for dax mappings.  This can lead to data corruption.

We want to support DAX for block devices eventually, but it requires
wider changes to properly manage the pagecache.

   blkdev_writepages+0x3f/0x50
   do_writepages+0x21/0x30

   set_blocksize+0x70/0xd0

   mount_bdev+0x180/0x1b0
   ext4_mount+0x15/0x20
   mount_fs+0x38/0x170

Mark the support broken so its disabled by default, but otherwise still
available for testing.
