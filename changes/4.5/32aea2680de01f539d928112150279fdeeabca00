ahci_xgene: Implement the workaround to fix the missing of the edge interrupt for the HOST_IRQ_STAT.

Due to H/W errata, the HOST_IRQ_STAT register misses the edge interrupt
when clearing the HOST_IRQ_STAT register and hardware reporting the
PORT_IRQ_STAT register happens to be at the same clock cycle.
