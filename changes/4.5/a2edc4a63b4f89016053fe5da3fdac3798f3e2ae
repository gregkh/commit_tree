ncr5380: Fix NCR5380_transfer_pio() result

According to the SCSI-2 draft revision 10L, atari_NCR5380.c is correct
when it says that the phase lines are valid up until ACK is negated
following the transmission of the last byte in MESSAGE IN phase. This is
true for all information transfer phases, from target to initiator.

Sample the phase bits in STATUS_REG so that NCR5380_transfer_pio() can
return the correct result. The return value is presently unused (perhaps
because of bugs like this) but this change at least fixes the caller's
phase variable, which is passed by reference.
