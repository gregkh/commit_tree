phy: twl4030-usb: Fix unbalanced pm_runtime_enable on module reload

If we reload phy-twl4030-usb, we get a warning about unbalanced
pm_runtime_enable. Let's fix the issue and also fix idling of the
device on unload before we attempt to shut it down.

If we don't properly idle the PHY before shutting it down on removal,
the twl4030 ends up consuming about 62mW of extra power compared to
running idle with the module loaded.
