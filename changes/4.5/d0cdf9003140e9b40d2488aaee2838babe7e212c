EDAC, sb_edac: Add Knights Landing (Xeon Phi gen 2) support

Knights Landing is the next generation architecture for HPC market.

KNL introduces concept of a tile and CHA - Cache/Home Agent for memory
accesses.

Some things are fixed in KNL:
() There's single DIMM slot per channel
() There's 2 memory controllers with 3 channels each, however,
   from EDAC standpoint, it is presented as single memory controller
   with 6 channels. In order to represent 2 MCs w/ 3 CH, it would
   require major redesign of EDAC core driver.

Basically, two functionalities are added/extended:
() during driver initialization KNL topology is being recognized, i.e.
   which channels are populated with what DIMM sizes
   (knl_get_dimm_capacity function)
() handle MCE errors - channel swizzling
