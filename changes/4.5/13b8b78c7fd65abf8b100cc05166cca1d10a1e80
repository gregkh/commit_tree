ALSA: oxfw: copy handlers of asynchronous transaction for MIDI capture

This commit copies some functions of asynchronous transactions for MIDI
capture, to merge scs1x module. The features of payload in asynchronous
transaction are:

 * System exclusive messages for SCS.1 are encoded without ID data. In
   this encoding scheme, 4 bits in LSB are available. The bits are squashed
   in payload byte. Thus, one payload byte transfers two MIDI messages.
 * The first byte of payload byte means:
  * 0x00: depending on second payload byte
   * 0xf9: including escaped system exclusive messages for SCS.1, up to
     3 byte (= 6 MIDI messages)
   * the others: including MIDI 1.0 messages
  * the others: including escaped system exclusive messages for SCS.1, up
    to 64 bytes
