crypto: algif_hash - Require setkey before accept(2)

Hash implementations that require a key may crash if you use
them without setting a key.  This patch adds the necessary checks
so that if you do attempt to use them without a key that we return
-ENOKEY instead of proceeding.

This patch also adds a compatibility path to support old applications
that do acept(2) before setkey.
