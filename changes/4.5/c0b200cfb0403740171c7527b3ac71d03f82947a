Drivers: hv: util: Increase the timeout for util services

Util services such as KVP and FCOPY need assistance from daemon's running
in user space. Increase the timeout so we don't prematurely terminate
the transaction in the kernel. Host sets up a 60 second timeout for
all util driver transactions. The host will retry the transaction if it
times out. Set the guest timeout at 30 seconds.
