Btrfs: add free space tree mount option

Now we can finally hook up everything so we can actually use free space
tree. The free space tree is enabled by passing the space_cache=v2 mount
option. On the first mount with the this option set, the free space tree
will be created and the FREE_SPACE_TREE read-only compat bit will be
set. Any time the filesystem is mounted from then on, we must use the
free space tree. The clear_cache option will also clear the free space
tree.
