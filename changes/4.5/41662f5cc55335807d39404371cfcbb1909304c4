sysctl: enable strict writes

SYSCTL_WRITES_WARN was added in commit f4aacea2f5d1 ("sysctl: allow for
strict write position handling"), and released in v3.16 in August of
2014.  Since then I can find only 1 instance of non-zero offset
writing[1], and it was fixed immediately in CRIU[2].  As such, it
appears safe to flip this to the strict state now.
