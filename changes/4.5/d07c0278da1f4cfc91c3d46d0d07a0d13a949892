net: bcmgenet: Fix internal PHY link state

The PHY link state is not chaged in GENETv2 caused by the previous
commit 49f7a471e4d1 ("net: bcmgenet: Properly configure PHY to ignore
interrupt") was set to PHY_IGNORE_INTERRUPT in bcmgenet_mii_probe().

The internal PHY should use phy_mac_interrupt() when not in use
PHY_POLL. The statement for phy_mac_interrupt() has two conditions. The
first condition to check GENET_HAS_MDIO_INTR is not related PHY link
state, so this patch removes it.
