MIPS: KVM: Refactor added offsetof()s

When calculating the offsets into the commpage for dynamically
translated mtc0/mfc0 guest instructions, multiple offsetof()s are added
together to find the offset of the specific register in the mips_coproc,
within the commpage.

Simplify each of these cases to a single offsetof() to find the offset
of the specific register within the commpage.
