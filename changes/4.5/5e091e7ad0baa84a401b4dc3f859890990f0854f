bnx2x: Utilize FW 7.13.1.0.

Commit 46e8a249423ff "bnx2x: Add FW 7.13.1.0" added said .bin FW to
linux-firmware; This patch incorporates the FW in the bnx2x driver.

This introduces 2 fixes/enhancements:
 - In some management protocols there are outer-vlan configurations
that can be dynamically changed while device is running. This fixes
some corner cases where such a change did not take effect.

 - Prevent VFs from sending MAC control frames; FW would treat a VF
sending such a packet as malicious and block any further communication
done by the VF.
