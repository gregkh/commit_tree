NVMe: Poll device while still active during remove

A device failure or link down wouldn't have been detected during namespace
removal. This patch keeps the device in the list for polling so that the
thread may see such failure and initiate a reset. The device is removed
from the list after disable, so we can safely flush the reset work as
it can't be requeued when disable completes.
