x86, vdso, pvclock: Simplify and speed up the vdso pvclock reader

The pvclock vdso code was too abstracted to understand easily
and excessively paranoid.  Simplify it for a huge speedup.

This opens the door for additional simplifications, as the vdso
no longer accesses the pvti for any vcpu other than vcpu 0.

Before, vclock_gettime using kvm-clock took about 45ns on my
machine. With this change, it takes 29ns, which is almost as
fast as the pure TSC implementation.
