net: cavium: liquidio: Return correct error code

The return value of vmalloc on failure of allocation of memory should
be -ENOMEM and not -1.

Found using Coccinelle. A simplified version of the semantic patch
used is:

//<smpl>
@@
expression *e;
identifier l1;
position p,q;
@@

e@q = vmalloc(...);
if@p (e == NULL) {
...
goto l1;
}
l1:
...
return -1
+ -ENOMEM
;
//</smpl

The single call site of the containing function checks whether the
returned value is -1, so this check is changed as well. The single call
site of this call site, however, only checks whether the value is not 0,
so no further change was required.
