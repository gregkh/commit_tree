dmaengine: dw: platform: power on device on shutdown

We have to call dw_dma_disable() to stop any ongoing transfer. On some
platforms we can't do that since DMA device is powered off. Moreover we have no
possibility at that point to check if the platform is affected or not. That's
why we call pm_runtime_get_sync() / pm_runtime_put() unconditionally. On the
other hand we can't use pm_runtime_suspended() because runtime PM framework is
not fully used by the driver.
