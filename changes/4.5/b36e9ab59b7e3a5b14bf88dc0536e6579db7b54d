i40e: properly delete VF MAC filters

The virtual channel interface was using incorrect semantics to remove
MAC addresses, which would leave incorrect filters active when using
VLANs. To correct this, add a new function that unconditionally removes
MAC addresses from all VLANs, and call this function when the VF
requests a MAC filter removal.
