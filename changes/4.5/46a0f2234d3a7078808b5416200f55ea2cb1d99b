drm/gma500: Drop dev->struct_mutex from fbdev init/teardown code

This is init/teardown code, locking is just to appease locking checks.
And since gem create/free doesn't need this any more there's really no
reason for grabbing dev->struct_mutex.

Again important to switch obj_unref to _unlocked variants.
