rcu: Add transitivity to remaining rcu_node ->lock acquisitions

The rule is that all acquisitions of the rcu_node structure's ->lock
must provide transitivity:  The lock is not acquired that frequently,
and sorting out exactly which required it and which did not would be
a maintenance nightmare.  This commit therefore supplies the needed
transitivity to the remaining ->lock acquisitions.
