pNFS/flexfiles: Support server-supplied layoutstats sampling period

Some servers want to be able to control the frequency with which clients
report layoutstats, for instance, in order to monitor QoS for a particular
file or set of file. In order to support this, the flexfiles layout allows
the server to pass this info as a hint in the layout payload.
