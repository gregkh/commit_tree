ASoC: pxa: magician: Fix enum ctl accesses in a wrong type

"Input Select" ctl in magician driver is an enum, while the current
driver accesses wrongly via value.integer.value[].  They have to be
via value.enumerated.item[] instead.

(Meanwhile "Headphone Switch" and "Speaker Switch" are boolean, so
 they should stay to access via value.integer.value[] as is.)
