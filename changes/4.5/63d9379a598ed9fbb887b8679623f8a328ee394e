ixgbe: Reduce VT code indent in set_vfta by introducing jump label

In order to clear the way for upcoming work I thought it best to drop the
level of indent in the ixgbe_set_vfta_generic function.  Most of the code
is held in the virtualization specific section.  So the easiest approach is
to just add a jump label and jump past the bulk of the code if it is not
enabled.
