ACPI: Revert "ACPI / video: Add Dell Inspiron 5737 to the blacklist"

The quirk to get "acpi_backlight=vendor" behavior by default on the
Dell Inspiron 5737 was added before we started doing
"acpi_backlight=native" by default on Win8 ready machines.

Since we now avoid using acpi-video as backlight driver on these machines
by default (using the native driver instead) we no longer need this quirk.

Moreover the vendor driver does not work after a suspend/resume where
as the native driver does.

This reverts commit 08a56226d847 (ACPI / video: Add Dell Inspiron 5737
to the blacklist).
