[media] uvcvideo: register entity subdev on init

The uvc_mc_register_entities() function iterated over the entities three
times to initialize the entities, register the subdev for the ones whose
type was UVC_TT_STREAMING and to create the entities links.

But this can be simplied by merging the init and registration logic in a
single loop.
