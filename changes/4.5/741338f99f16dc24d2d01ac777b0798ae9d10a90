ASoC: dapm: Fix ctl value accesses in a wrong type

snd_soc_dapm_dai_link_get() and _put() access the associated ctl
values as value.integer.value[].  However, this is an enum ctl, and it
has to be accessed via value.enumerated.item[].  The former is long
while the latter is unsigned int, so they don't align.
