ALSA: seq: Fix snd_seq_call_port_info_ioctl in compat mode

This reverts one hunk of
commit ef44a1ec6eee ("ALSA: sound/core: use memdup_user()"), which
replaced a number of kmalloc followed by memcpy with memdup calls.

In this case, we are copying from a struct snd_seq_port_info32 to a
struct snd_seq_port_info, but the latter is 4 bytes longer than the
32-bit version, so we need to separate kmalloc and copy calls.
