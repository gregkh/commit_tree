phy: ti-pipe3: use ti_pipe3_power_off to power off the PHY during probe

No functional change. Previously omap_control_phy_power() was used to power
off the PHY during probe. But once PIPE3 driver is adapted to use syscon,
omap_control_phy_power() cannot be used. Hence used ti_pipe3_power_off
to power off the PHY.
