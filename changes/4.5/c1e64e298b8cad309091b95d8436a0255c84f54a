net: diag: Support destroying TCP sockets.

This implements SOCK_DESTROY for TCP sockets. It causes all
blocking calls on the socket to fail fast with ECONNABORTED and
causes a protocol close of the socket. It informs the other end
of the connection by sending a RST, i.e., initiating a TCP ABORT
as per RFC 793. ECONNABORTED was chosen for consistency with
FreeBSD.
