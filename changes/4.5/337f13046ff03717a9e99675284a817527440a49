futex: Allow FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME with FUTEX_WAIT op

While reviewing Michael Kerrisk's recent futex manpage update, I noticed
that we allow the FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME flag for FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET but
not for FUTEX_WAIT.

FUTEX_WAIT is treated as a simple version for FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET
internally (with a bitmask of FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY). As such, I cannot
come up with a reason for this exclusion for FUTEX_WAIT.

This change does modify the behavior of the futex syscall, changing a
call with FUTEX_WAIT | FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME from returning -ENOSYS, to be
equivalent to FUTEX_WAIT_BITSET | FUTEX_CLOCK_REALTIME with a bitset of
FUTEX_BITSET_MATCH_ANY.
