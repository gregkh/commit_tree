KVM: PPC: Increase memslots to 512

Only using 32 memslots for KVM on powerpc is way too low, you can
nowadays hit this limit quite fast by adding a couple of PCI devices
and/or pluggable memory DIMMs to the guest.

x86 already increased the KVM_USER_MEM_SLOTS to 509, to satisfy 256
pluggable DIMM slots, 3 private slots and 253 slots for other things
like PCI devices (i.e. resulting in 256 + 3 + 253 = 512 slots in
total). We should do something similar for powerpc, and since we do
not use private slots here, we can set the value to 512 directly.

While we're at it, also remove the KVM_MEM_SLOTS_NUM definition
from the powerpc-specific header since this gets defined in the
generic kvm_host.h header anyway.
