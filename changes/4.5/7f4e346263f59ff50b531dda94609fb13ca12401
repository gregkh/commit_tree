arm64/efi: Make strnlen() available to the EFI namespace

Changes introduced in the upstream version of libfdt pulled in by commit
91feabc2e224 ("scripts/dtc: Update to upstream commit b06e55c88b9b") use
the strnlen() function, which isn't currently available to the EFI name-
space. Add it to the EFI namespace to avoid a linker error.
