ALSA: timer: Harden slave timer list handling

A slave timer instance might be still accessible in a racy way while
operating the master instance as it lacks of locking.  Since the
master operation is mostly protected with timer->lock, we should cope
with it while changing the slave instance, too.  Also, some linked
lists (active_list and ack_list) of slave instances aren't unlinked
immediately at stopping or closing, and this may lead to unexpected
accesses.

This patch tries to address these issues.  It adds spin lock of
timer->lock (either from master or slave, which is equivalent) in a
few places.  For avoiding a deadlock, we ensure that the global
slave_active_lock is always locked at first before each timer lock.

Also, ack and active_list of slave instances are properly unlinked at
snd_timer_stop() and snd_timer_close().

Last but not least, remove the superfluous call of _snd_timer_stop()
at removing slave links.  This is a noop, and calling it may confuse
readers wrt locking.  Further cleanup will follow in a later patch.

Actually we've got reports of use-after-free by syzkaller fuzzer, and
this hopefully fixes these issues.
