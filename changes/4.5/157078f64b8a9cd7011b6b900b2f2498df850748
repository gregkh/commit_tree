Revert "jffs2: Fix lock acquisition order bug in jffs2_write_begin"

This reverts commit 5ffd3412ae55
("jffs2: Fix lock acquisition order bug in jffs2_write_begin").

The commit modified jffs2_write_begin() to remove a deadlock with
jffs2_garbage_collect_live(), but this introduced new deadlocks found
by multiple users. page_lock() actually has to be called before
mutex_lock(&c->alloc_sem) or mutex_lock(&f->sem) because
jffs2_write_end() and jffs2_readpage() are called with the page locked,
and they acquire c->alloc_sem and f->sem, resp.

In other words, the lock order in jffs2_write_begin() was correct, and
it is the jffs2_garbage_collect_live() path that has to be changed.

Revert the commit to get rid of the new deadlocks, and to clear the way
for a better fix of the original deadlock.
