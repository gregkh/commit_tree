checkpatch: fix a number of COMPLEX_MACRO false positives

A simple search over the kernel souce displays a number of correctly
defined multiline macro, which generally are used as an array element
initializer:

% find ../linux -type f | xargs grep -B1 -H '^[:space]*\[.*\\$'

However checkpatch.pl unexpectedly complains about all these macro
definitions:

% ./scripts/checkpatch.pl --types COMPLEX_MACRO -f include/linux/perf/arm_pmu.h

ERROR: Macros with complex values should be enclosed in parentheses
+#define PERF_MAP_ALL_UNSUPPORTED					\
+	 [0 ... PERF_COUNT_HW_MAX - 1] = HW_OP_UNSUPPORTED

The change intends to fix this type of false positives by flattening
only array members and skipping array element designators.
