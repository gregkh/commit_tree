drm/i915/dsi: merge pre_pll_enable hook to pre_enable

For DSI, the pre_pll_enable and the pre_enable hooks are called
back-to-back on all platforms that support DSI. The distinction is
artificial for DSI, for which we enable the DSI PLL in the encoder
hooks. Do everything in pre_enable, and remove DSI pre_pll_enable hook.
