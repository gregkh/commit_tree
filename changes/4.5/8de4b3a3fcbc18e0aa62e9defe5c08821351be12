usb: phy: msm: Trigger USB state detection work in DRD mode

When working in Dual Role Device mode, USB state machine is not kicked,
when host or gadget drivers are loaded. Fix this be explicitly triggering
state detection on client driver load.

Issue is that if the board is booted without micro usb cable and usb
device attached, kernel fails to populate the usb host and device.
The reason for this is that the state machine worker logic only checks
for USB_DR_MODE_PERIPHERAL and USB_DR_MODE_HOST modes to run worker
thread. However if the phy is configured in OTG mode it would fail
to run the state machine, resulting in failure to detect for very
first time.

This patch fixes the issue by removing the explicit checks.

Issue is noticed on Qualcomm Dragon board DB410C.
