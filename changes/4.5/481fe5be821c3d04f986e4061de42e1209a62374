dell-wmi: Process only one event on devices with interface version 0

BIOS/ACPI on devices with WMI interface version 0 does not clear buffer
before filling it. So next time when BIOS/ACPI send WMI event which is
smaller as previous then it contains garbage in buffer from previous event.

BIOS/ACPI on devices with WMI interface version 1 clears buffer and
sometimes send more events in buffer at one call.

Since commit 83fc44c32ad8 ("dell-wmi: Update code for processing WMI
events") dell-wmi process all events in buffer (and not just first).

To prevent reading garbage from the buffer we process only the first
event on devices with WMI interface version 0.
