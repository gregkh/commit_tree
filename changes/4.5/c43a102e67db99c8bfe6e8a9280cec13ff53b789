iio: ina2xx: add support for TI INA2xx Power Monitors

in SOFTWARE buffer mode, a kthread will capture the active scan_elements
into a kfifo, then compute the remaining time until the next capture tick
and do an active wait (udelay).

This will produce a stream of up to fours channels plus a 64bits
timestamps (ns).

Tested with ina226, on BeagleBoneBlack.
