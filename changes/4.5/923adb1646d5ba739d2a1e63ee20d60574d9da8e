cxl: Fix PSL timebase synchronization detection

The PSL timebase synchronization is seemingly failing for
configuration not including VIRT_CPU_ACCOUNTING_NATIVE. The driver
shows the following trace in dmesg:
PSL: Timebase sync: giving up!

The PSL timebase register is actually syncing correctly, but the cxl
driver is not detecting it. Fix is to use the proper timebase-to-time
conversion.
