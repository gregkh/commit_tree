x86/delay: Avoid preemptible context checks in delay_mwaitx()

We do use this_cpu_ptr(&cpu_tss) as a cacheline-aligned, seldomly
accessed per-cpu var as the MONITORX target in delay_mwaitx(). However,
when called in preemptible context, this_cpu_ptr -> smp_processor_id() ->
debug_smp_processor_id() fires:

  BUG: using smp_processor_id() in preemptible [00000000] code: udevd/312
  caller is delay_mwaitx+0x40/0xa0

But we don't care about that check - we only need cpu_tss as a MONITORX
target and it doesn't really matter which CPU's var we're touching as
we're going idle anyway. Fix that.
