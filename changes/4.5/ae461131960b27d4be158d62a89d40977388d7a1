of: of_mdio: Add a whitelist of PHY compatibilities.

Some phy nodes list a compatible value indicating the PHY make/model.
This is never used to match the device to the driver. However it does
confuse the code to separate a PHY from a generic MDIO device like a
switch. Generic MDIO devices must have a compatible value, PHYs can
list clause 22 or 45, but nothing else.

Issue a warning if we find a compatible value known on the whitelist,
and say it is a PHY.
