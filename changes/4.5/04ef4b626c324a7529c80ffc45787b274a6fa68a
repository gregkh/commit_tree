f2fs: fix to enable missing ioctl interfaces in ->compat_ioctl

In 64-bit kernel f2fs can supports 32-bit ioctl system call by identifying
encoded code which is converted from 32-bit one to 64-bit one in
->compat_ioctl.

When we introduced new interfaces in ->ioctl, we forgot to enable them in
->compat_ioctl, so enable them for fixing.
