btrfs: Fix calculation of rbio->dbitmap's size calculation

Current code is trying to calculate rbio->dbitmap's size to make it
align to sizeof(long), but implement haven't achived this object,
it is align to sizeof(char) instead.
This patch fixed above calculation, and use sizeof(long) instead of
fixed "8" to increate compatibility.
