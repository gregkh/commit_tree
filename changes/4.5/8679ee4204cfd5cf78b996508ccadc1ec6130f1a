Input: gpio-keys - fix check for disabling unsupported keys

Commit 4ea14a53d8f881034fa9e186653821c4e3d9a8fb ("Input: gpio-keys - report
error when disabling unsupported key") tried let user know that they
attempted to disable an unsupported key, unfortunately the check is wrong
as it believes that all codes are invalid. Fix it by ensuring that keys
that we try to disable are subset of keys (or switches) that device
reports.
