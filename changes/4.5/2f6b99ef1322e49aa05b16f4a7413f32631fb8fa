ARM: Add CONFIG_DEPRECATED_PARAM_STRUCT to netwinder_defconfig

Fed up with all that fancy new 64bit HW? Look no further!
Get your NetWinder out of the closet (or in my case, the tip) and
run -next on it!

All it takes is a small defconfig change to be able to take
the parameters from the bootloader...
