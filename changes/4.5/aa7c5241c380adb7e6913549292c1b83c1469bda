tmpfs: Use xattr handler infrastructure

Use the VFS xattr handler infrastructure and get rid of similar code in
the filesystem.  For implementing shmem_xattr_handler_set, we need a
version of simple_xattr_set which removes the attribute when value is
NULL.  Use this to implement kernfs_iop_removexattr as well.
