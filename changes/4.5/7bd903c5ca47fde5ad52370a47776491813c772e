dmaengine: core: Move and merge the code paths using private_candidate

Channel matching with private_candidate() is used in two paths, the error
checking is slightly different in them and they are duplicating code also.
Move the code under find_candidate() to provide consistent execution and
going to allow us to reuse this mode of channel lookup later.
