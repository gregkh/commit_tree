ixgbe: Add support for adding/removing VLAN on PF bypassing the VLVF

This patch adds support for bypassing the VLVF entry creation when the PF
is adding a new VLAN.  The advantage to doing this is that we can then save
the VLVF entries for the VFs which must have them in order to function,
versus the PF which can fall back on the default pool entry.
