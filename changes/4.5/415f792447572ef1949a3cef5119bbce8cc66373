iio: Move IIO Dummy Driver out of staging

This patch moves the reference IIO dummy driver from drivers/staging/iio
into a separate folder, drivers/iio/dummy and adds the proper Kconfig
and Makefile for it.

A new config menu entry called IIO dummy driver has also been added
in the Industrial I/O support menu, corresponding to this driver.
