ARM: KVM: Cleanup exception injection

David Binderman reported that the exception injection code had a
couple of unused variables lingering around.

Upon examination, it looked like this code could do with an
anticipated spring cleaning, which amounts to deduplicating
the CPSR/SPSR update, and making it look a bit more like
the architecture spec.

The spurious variables are removed in the process.
