Input: goodix - add power management support

Implement suspend/resume for goodix driver.

The suspend and resume process uses the gpio pins.  If the device ACPI/DT
information does not declare gpio pins, suspend/resume will not be
available for these devices.

This is based on Goodix datasheets for GT911 and GT9271 and on Goodix
driver gt9xx.c for Android (publicly available in Android kernel trees for
various devices).
