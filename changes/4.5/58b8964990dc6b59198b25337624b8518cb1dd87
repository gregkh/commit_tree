irqchip/gic: Assign irqchip dynamically

Instead of having the irqchip being a static struct, make it part
of the per-instance data so we can assign it a dynamic name. This
has the usable side effect of displaying the GIC with an instance
number as GIC0, GIC1 ... GICn in /proc/interrupts, which is helpful
when debugging cascaded GICs, such as on the ARM PB11MPCore.
