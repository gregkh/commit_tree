component: fix crash on x86_64 with hda audio drivers

Maarten reports that the addition of releasing match data to the
component helper results in a general protection fault on x86_64.

This is caused by the devm resources being freed in reverse order
to their allocation, which caused a use-after-free of the match
array.

Switch the match array to be a more conventional kmalloc/kfree()
affair, explicitly freeing it along with the parent match data
structure.
