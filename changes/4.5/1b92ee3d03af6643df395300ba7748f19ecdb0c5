af_unix: Don't set err in unix_stream_read_generic unless there was an error

The present unix_stream_read_generic contains various code sequences of
the form

err = -EDISASTER;
if (<test>)
	goto out;

This has the unfortunate side effect of possibly causing the error code
to bleed through to the final

out:
	return copied ? : err;

and then to be wrongly returned if no data was copied because the caller
didn't supply a data buffer, as demonstrated by the program available at

http://pad.lv/1540731

Change it such that err is only set if an error condition was detected.
