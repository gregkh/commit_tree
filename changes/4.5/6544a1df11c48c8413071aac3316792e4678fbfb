Input: elantech - mark protocols v2 and v3 as semi-mt

When using a protocol v2 or v3 hardware, elantech uses the function
elantech_report_semi_mt_data() to report data. This devices are rather
creepy because if num_finger is 3, (x2,y2) is (0,0). Yes, only one valid
touch is reported.

Anyway, userspace (libinput) is now confused by these (0,0) touches,
and detect them as palm, and rejects them.

Commit 3c0213d17a09 ("Input: elantech - fix semi-mt protocol for v3 HW")
was sufficient enough for xf86-input-synaptics and libinput before it has
palm rejection. Now we need to actually tell libinput that this device is
a semi-mt one and it should not rely on the actual values of the 2 touches.
