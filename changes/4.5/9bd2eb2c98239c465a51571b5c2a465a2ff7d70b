drbd: also bump UUIDs if a diskless primary connects

If for some reason the primary lost its disk *and* the replication link
before it is able to communicate the disk loss, probably blocked IO,
then later is able to re-establish the connection, the peer needs to
bump its UUIDs just like it does when peer only loses the disk
and is able to communicate this in time.

Otherwise, a later re-attach of the disk on the primary may start a
resync in the "wrong" direction.
