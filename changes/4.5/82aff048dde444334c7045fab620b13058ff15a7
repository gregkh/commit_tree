pwm: lpc32xx: make device usable with common clock framework

As a preparatory change for switching LPC32xx mach support to common
clock framework fix clk_enable/clk_disable calls without matching
clk_prepare/clk_unprepare.

The driver can not be used on a platform with common clock framework
until clk_prepare/clk_unprepare calls are added, otherwise clk_enable
calls will fail and a WARN is generated:
