mm/memblock: add MEMBLOCK_NOMAP attribute to memblock memory table

This introduces the MEMBLOCK_NOMAP attribute and the required plumbing
to make it usable as an indicator that some parts of normal memory
should not be covered by the kernel direct mapping. It is up to the
arch to actually honor the attribute when laying out this mapping,
but the memblock code itself is modified to disregard these regions
for allocations and other general use.
