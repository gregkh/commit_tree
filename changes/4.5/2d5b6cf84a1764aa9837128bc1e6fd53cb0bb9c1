clk: tegra: Use definition for pll_u override bit

The definition, PLLU_BASE_OVERRIDE, for the pll_u OVERRIDE bit is defined
but not used and when the OVERRIDE bit is cleared in tegra210_pll_init()
the code directly uses the bit number. Therefore, use the definition,
PLLU_BASE_OVERRIDE when clearing the OVERRIDE bit.
