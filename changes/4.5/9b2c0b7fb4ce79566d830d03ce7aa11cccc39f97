drm: Serialise multiple event readers

The previous patch reintroduced a race condition whereby a failure in
one reader may allow a second reader to see out-of-order events.
Introduce a mutex to serialise readers so that an event is completed in
its entirety before another reader may process an event. The two readers
may race against each other, but the events each retrieves are in the
correct order.
