ACPI / PM: Support D3 COLD device in old BIOS for ZPODD

D3cold is only regarded as valid if the "_PR3" object is
present for the given device after the commit 20dacb71ad28
("ACPI/PM: Rework device power management to follow ACPI 6").

But some old BIOS only defined "_PS3" for the D3COLD device,
such as ZPODD device. And old kernel also believes the device with
"_PS3" is a D3COLD device.

So, add some logics for supporting D3 COLD device with old BIOS
which is compatible with earlier ACPI spec and kernel behavior.
