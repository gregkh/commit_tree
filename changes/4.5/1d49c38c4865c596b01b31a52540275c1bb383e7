NVMe: Use a retryable error code on reset

A negative status has the "do not retry" bit set, which makes it not
retryable.  Use a fake status that can potentially be retried on reset.

An aborted command's status is overridden by the timeout handler so
that it won't be retried, which is necessary to keep initialization from
getting into a reset loop.
