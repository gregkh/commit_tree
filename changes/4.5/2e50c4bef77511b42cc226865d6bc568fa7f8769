scripts/recordmcount.pl: support data in text section on powerpc

If a text section starts out with a data blob before the first
function start label, disassembly parsing doing in recordmcount.pl
gets confused on powerpc, leading to creation of corrupted module
objects.

This was not a problem so far since the compiler would never create
such text sections.  However, this has changed with a recent change
in GCC 6 to support distances of > 2GB between a function and its
assoicated TOC in the ELFv2 ABI, exposing this problem.

There is already code in recordmcount.pl to handle such data blobs
on the sparc64 platform.  This patch uses the same method to handle
those on powerpc as well.
