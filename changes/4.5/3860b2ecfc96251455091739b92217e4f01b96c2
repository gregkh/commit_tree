drm/i915: Suppress spurious CPU FIFO underruns on ILK-IVB

We still get spurious pipe underruns on ILK/SNB/IVB under two
circumstances when dealing with PCH ports:
* When the pipe has been disabled, but FDI RX/TX is still enabled
* During FDI link training

Both cases seem to happen at least when we do VGA+HDMI cloning
from the same pipe. I don't think I've seen them when not cloning,
but can't be 100% sure.

Disable underrun reporting around those places to eliminate the
dmesg errors.
