Btrfs: fix fitrim discarding device area reserved for boot loader's use

As of the 4.3 kernel release, the fitrim ioctl can now discard any region
of a disk that is not allocated to any chunk/block group, including the
first megabyte which is used for our primary superblock and by the boot
loader (grub for example).

Fix this by not allowing to trim/discard any region in the device starting
with an offset not greater than min(alloc_start_mount_option, 1Mb), just
as it was not possible before 4.3.

A reproducer test case for xfstests follows.

  seq=`basename $0`
  seqres=$RESULT_DIR/$seq
  echo "QA output created by $seq"
  tmp=/tmp/$$
  status=1	# failure is the default!
  trap "_cleanup; exit \$status" 0 1 2 3 15

  _cleanup()
  {
      cd /
      rm -f $tmp.*
  }

  # get standard environment, filters and checks
  . ./common/rc
  . ./common/filter

  # real QA test starts here
  _need_to_be_root
  _supported_fs btrfs
  _supported_os Linux
  _require_scratch

  rm -f $seqres.full

  _scratch_mkfs >>$seqres.full 2>&1

  # Write to the [0, 64Kb[ and [68Kb, 1Mb[ ranges of the device. These ranges are
  # reserved for a boot loader to use (GRUB for example) and btrfs should never
  # use them - neither for allocating metadata/data nor should trim/discard them.
  # The range [64Kb, 68Kb[ is used for the primary superblock of the filesystem.
  $XFS_IO_PROG -c "pwrite -S 0xfd 0 64K" $SCRATCH_DEV | _filter_xfs_io
  $XFS_IO_PROG -c "pwrite -S 0xfd 68K 956K" $SCRATCH_DEV | _filter_xfs_io

  # Now mount the filesystem and perform a fitrim against it.
  _scratch_mount
  _require_batched_discard $SCRATCH_MNT
  $FSTRIM_PROG $SCRATCH_MNT

  # Now unmount the filesystem and verify the content of the ranges was not
  # modified (no trim/discard happened on them).
  _scratch_unmount
  echo "Content of the ranges [0, 64Kb] and [68Kb, 1Mb[ after fitrim:"
  od -t x1 -N $((64 * 1024)) $SCRATCH_DEV
  od -t x1 -j $((68 * 1024)) -N $((956 * 1024)) $SCRATCH_DEV

  status=0
  exit
