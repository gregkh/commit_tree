s390/kdump: remove code to create ELF notes in the crashed system

The s390 architecture can store the CPU registers of the crashed system
after the kdump kernel has been started and this is the preferred way.
Remove the remaining code fragments that deal with storing CPU registers
while the crashed system is still active.
