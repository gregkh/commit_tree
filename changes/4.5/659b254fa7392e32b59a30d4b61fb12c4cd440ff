md-cluster: remove a disk asynchronously from cluster environment

For cluster raid, if one disk couldn't be reach in one node, then
other nodes would receive the REMOVE message for the disk.

In receiving node, we can't call md_kick_rdev_from_array to remove
the disk from array synchronously since the disk might still be busy
in this node. So let's set a ClusterRemove flag on the disk, then
let the thread to do the removal job eventually.
