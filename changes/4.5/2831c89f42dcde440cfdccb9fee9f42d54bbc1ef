pty: fix possible use after free of tty->driver_data

This change fixes a bug for a corner case where we have the the last
release from a pty master/slave coming from a previously opened /dev/tty
file. When this happens, the tty->driver_data can be stale, due to all
ptmx or pts/N files having already been closed before (and thus the inode
related to these files, which tty->driver_data points to, being already
freed/destroyed).

The fix here is to keep a reference on the opened master ptmx inode.
We maintain the inode referenced until the final pty_unix98_shutdown,
and only pass this inode to devpts_kill_index.
