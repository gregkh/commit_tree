drm/i915/skl: disable DC states before display core init/uninit

We need to disable the DC states during display core init to sanitize
the HW state we inherit from the BIOS. We need to disable it during
display core uninit too, since the power well framework will leave it
enabled (since we get to the display core uninit step with all power
domains disabled already).
