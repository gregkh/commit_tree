serial: sh-sci: Don't overwrite clock selection in serial_console_write()

Blindly writing the default configuration value into the SCSCR register
may change the clock selection bits, breaking the serial console if the
current driver settings differ from the default settings.

Keep the current clock selection bits to prevent this from happening
on e.g. r8a7791/koelsch when support for the BRG will be added.
