block: bio: introduce helpers to get the 1st and last bvec

The bio passed to bio_will_gap() may be fast cloned from upper
layer(dm, md, bcache, fs, ...), or from bio splitting in block
core.

Unfortunately bio_will_gap() just figures out the last bvec via
'bi_io_vec[prev->bi_vcnt - 1]' directly, and this way is obviously
wrong.

This patch introduces two helpers for getting the first and last
bvec of one bio for fixing the issue.
