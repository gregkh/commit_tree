perf hists: Fix hists_evsel to release hists

Since hists__init doesn't set the destructor of hists_evsel (which is an
extended evsel structure), when hists_evsel is released, the extended
part of the hists_evsel is not deleted (note that the hists_evsel object
itself is freed).

This fixes it to add a destructor for hists__evsel and to set it up.
