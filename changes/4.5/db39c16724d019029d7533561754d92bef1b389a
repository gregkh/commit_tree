fs:affs:Replace time_t with time64_t

The affs code uses "time_t" and "get_seconds()". This will cause
problems on 32-bit architectures in 2038 when time_t overflows.
This patch replaces them with "time64_t" and
"ktime_get_real_seconds()". This patch introduces expensive 64-bit
divsion in "secs_to_datestamp()", considering this function is not
called so often, the cost should be acceptable.
