ACPI / video: driver must be registered before checking for keypresses

acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses() may use an uninitialized mutex.
The error has been reported by lockdep: DEBUG_LOCKS_WARN_ON(l->magic != l).
The function assumes that the video driver has been registered before being
called. As explained in the comment of acpi_video_init(), the registration
of the video class may be defered and thus may not take place in the init
function of the module.

Use completion mechanisms to make sure that
acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses() wait for the completion of
acpi_video_register() before using the mutex.
Also get rid of register_count since task completion can replace it.
