i2c: rcar: remove spinlock

After making sure to reinit the HW and clear interrupts in the timeout
case, we know that interrupts are always disabled in the sections
protected by the spinlock. Thus, we can simply remove it which is a
preparation for further refactoring. While here, rename the timeout
variable to time_left which is way more readable.
