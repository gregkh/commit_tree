    drm/i915: Power gating display wells during i915_pm_suspend

moved for_each_power_domain from intel_display.c to i915_drv.h but we
still have the definition around in intel_display.c, due to a merge
conflict resolution gone wrong in

    Merge remote-tracking branch 'airlied/drm-next' into drm-intel-next

Just remove the extra definition left behind.
