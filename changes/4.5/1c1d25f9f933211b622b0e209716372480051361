dmaengine: omap-dma: Remove tasklet to start the transfers

The use of tasklet to actually start the DMA transfer slightly decreases the
DMA throughput since it adds small scheduling delay when the transfer is
started. In normal use, even with high I/O load the tasklet would start
one transaction at a time, however running the DMAtest for memcpy on all
available channels will cause the tasklet to start about 15 transfers.
The performance numbers on OMAP4 PandaBoard-es (test_buf_size = 6553):
With the tasklet:
