torture: Place console.log files correctly from the get-go

Currently, the console output files ("console.log") are placed in the
build directory initially, then copied to the results directory.
One problem with this is if a qemu refuses to die in a timely fashion
after a kernel hang, it will continue to write after the next qemu
starts up, resulting in confusing output from the old instance of
qemu.  This commit prevents such confusion by placing the console.log
files into the results directory to begin with, so that a given instance
of qemu is always writing only to its own console.log file.
