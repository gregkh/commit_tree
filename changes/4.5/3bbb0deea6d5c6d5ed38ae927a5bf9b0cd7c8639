mmc: core: fix __mmc_switch timeout caused by preempt

there is a time window between __mmc_send_status() and time_afer(),
on some eMMC chip, the timeout_ms is only 10ms, if this thread was
scheduled out during this period, then, even card has already changes
to transfer state by the result of CMD13, this part of code also treat
it to timeout error.
So, need calculate timeout first, then call __mmc_send_status(), if
already timeout and card still in programing state, then treat it to
the real timeout error.
