udf: avoid uninitialized variable use

A new warning has come up from a recent cleanup:

fs/udf/inode.c: In function 'udf_setup_indirect_aext':
fs/udf/inode.c:1927:28: warning: 'adsize' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

If the alloc_type is neither ICBTAG_FLAG_AD_SHORT nor
ICBTAG_FLAG_AD_LONG, the value of adsize is undefined. Currently,
callers of these functions make sure alloc_type is one of the two valid
ones but for future proofing make sure we handle the case of invalid
alloc type as well.  This changes the code to return -EIOin that case.
