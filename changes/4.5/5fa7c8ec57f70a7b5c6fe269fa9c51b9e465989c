perf: Remove/simplify lockdep annotation

Now that the perf_event_ctx_lock_nested() call has moved from
put_event() into perf_event_release_kernel() the first reason is no
longer valid as that can no longer happen.

The second reason seems to have been invalidated when Al Viro made fput()
unconditionally async in the following commit:

  4a9d4b024a31 ("switch fput to task_work_add")

such that munmap()->fput()->release()->perf_release() would no longer happen.

Therefore, remove the annotation. This should increase the efficiency
of lockdep coverage of perf locking.
