ext4: fix races between buffered IO and collapse / insert range

Current code implementing FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE and
FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE is prone to races with buffered writes and page
faults. If buffered write or write via mmap manages to squeeze between
filemap_write_and_wait_range() and truncate_pagecache() in the fallocate
implementations, the written data is simply discarded by
truncate_pagecache() although it should have been shifted.

Fix the problem by moving filemap_write_and_wait_range() call inside
i_mutex and i_mmap_sem. That way we are protected against races with
both buffered writes and page faults.
