ath10k: fix peer assoc complete WMI command for 10.4

There is an extra 4-byte member when compared to WMI 10.2 added to
assoc complete command in WMI 10.4. This new member is used for 160Mhz
related configuration. This WMI command mismatch between host and
firmware does not cause any real issues because this new member is not
used in 10.4 firmwares so far (10.4.1.00030-1). This difference in WMI
command interface brings in a new wmi_ops for 10.4 gen_peer_assoc().
No noticeable functionality differences with this change can be seen
with the current 10.4 firmwares, but the WMI interface has to be
fixed to work with future 10.4 firmwares which may be using this new
member.
