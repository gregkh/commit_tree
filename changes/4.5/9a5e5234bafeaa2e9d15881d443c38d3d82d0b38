ALSA: hda - Fix superfluous HDMI jack repoll

The recent commit [e90247f9fcee: ALSA: hda - Split ELD update code
from hdmi_present_sense()] rewrote the HDMI jack handling code, but a
slight behavior change sneaked in unexpectedly.  When the jack isn't
connected, it tries repoll unnecessarily.

This patch addresses the flaw, to the right behavior as before.
