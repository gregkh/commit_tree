net: sctp: prevent writes to cookie_hmac_alg from accessing invalid memory

proc_dostring() needs an initialized destination string, while the one
provided in proc_sctp_do_hmac_alg() contains stack garbage.

Thus, writing to cookie_hmac_alg would strlen() that garbage and end up
accessing invalid memory.
