livepatch: function,sympos scheme in livepatch sysfs directory

The following directory structure will allow for cases when the same
function name exists in a single object.
	/sys/kernel/livepatch/<patch>/<object>/<function,sympos>

The sympos number corresponds to the nth occurrence of the symbol name in
kallsyms for the patched object.

An example of patching multiple symbols can be found here:
