ipv6: always add flag an address that failed DAD with DADFAILED

The userspace needs to know why is the address being removed so that it can
perhaps obtain a new address.

Without the DADFAILED flag it's impossible to distinguish removal of a
temporary and tentative address due to DAD failure from other reasons (device
removed, manual address removal).
