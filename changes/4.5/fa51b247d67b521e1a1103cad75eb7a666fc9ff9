net/mlx4: fix some error handling in mlx4_multi_func_init()

The while loop after err_slaves should use post-decrement; otherwise
we'll fail to do the kfrees for i==0, and will run into out-of-bounds
accesses if the setup above failed already at i==0.

[I'm not sure why one even bothers populating the ->vlan_filter array:
mlx4.h isn't #included by anything outside
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx4/, and "git grep -C2 -w vlan_filter
drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx4/" seems to suggest that the
vlan_filter elements aren't used at all.]
