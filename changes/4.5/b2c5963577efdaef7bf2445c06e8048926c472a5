MIPS: Move KVM specific opcodes into asm/inst.h

The header arch/mips/kvm/opcode.h defines a few extra opcodes which
aren't in arch/mips/include/uapi/asm/inst.h. There's nothing KVM
specific about them, so lets move them into inst.h where they belong and
delete the header.

Note that mfmcz_op is renamed to mfmc0_op to match the instruction set
manual, and wait_op was already added to inst.h in commit b0a3eae2b943
("MIPS: inst.h: define COP0 wait op"), merged in v3.16-rc1.
