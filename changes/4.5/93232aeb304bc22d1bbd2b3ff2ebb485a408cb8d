    drm/i915: mark GEM object pages dirty when mapped & written by the CPU

introduced a check into i915_gem_object_get_dirty_pages() that returned
a NULL pointer when called with a bad object, one that was not backed by
shmemfs. This WARN was too strict as we can work on all struct page
backed objects, and resulted in a WARN + GPF for existing userspace. In
order to differentiate the various types of objects, add a new flags field
to the i915_gem_object_ops struct to describe their capabilities, with
the first flag being whether the object has struct pages.

v2: Drop silly const before an integer in the structure declaration.
