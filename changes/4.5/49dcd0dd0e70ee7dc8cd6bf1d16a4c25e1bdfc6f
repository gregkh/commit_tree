staging: wilc1000: pass wilc to all function pointers of wilc_hif_func

This patch adds new function parameter struct wilc to all function pointers
of struct wilc_hif_func, and all functions of wilc_sdio.c and wilc_spi.c
need to be changed as it's function pointer is changed.
Pass wilc in all the functions call as well.

The wilc will be passed to functions in linux_wlan_sdio.c and linux_wlan_spi.c
to replace with global variable wilc_dev in the next patch.
