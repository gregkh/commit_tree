ARM: dts: Fix power domain for sysmmu-rotator device on exynos4

Rotator device and it's SYSMMU belongs to different power domains
on various Exynos4 SoC revisions: LCD0 for 4210 and TOP for 4x12. This
patch fixes this by moving power-domains property to exynos4210.dtsi. TOP
power domain is always enabled and it is not represented in DTS.
