blackfin-cpufreq: Change return type of cpu_set_cclk() to that of clk_set_rate()

The return type "unsigned long" was used by the cpu_set_cclk() function
while the type "int" is provided by the clk_set_rate() function.
Let us make this usage consistent.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
