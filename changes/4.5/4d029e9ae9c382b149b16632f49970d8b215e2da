ncr5380: Eliminate USLEEP_WAITLONG delay

Linux 2.1.105 introduced the USLEEP_WAITLONG delay, apparently "needed for
Mustek scanners". It is intended to stall the issue queue for 5 seconds.
There are a number of problems with this.

1. Only g_NCR5380 enables the delay, which implies that the other five
   drivers using the NCR5380.c core driver remain incompatible with
   Mustek scanners.

2. The delay is not implemented by atari_NCR5380.c, which is problematic
   for re-unifying the two core driver forks.

3. The delay is implemented using NCR5380_set_timer() which makes it
   unreliable. A new command queued by the mid-layer cancels the delay.

4. The delay is applied indiscriminately in several situations in which
   NCR5380_select() returns -1. These are-- reselection by the target,
   failure of the target to assert BSY, and failure of the target to
   assert REQ. It's clear from the comments that USLEEP_WAITLONG is not
   relevant to the reselection case. And reportedly, these scanners do
   not disconnect.

5. atari_NCR5380.c was forked before Linux 2.1.105, so it was spared some
   of the damage done to NCR5380.c. In this case, the atari_NCR5380.c core
   driver was more standard-compliant and may not have needed any
   workaround like the USLEEP_WAITLONG kludge. The compliance issue was
   addressed in the previous patch.

If these scanners still don't work, we need a better solution. Retrying
selection until EH aborts a command offers equivalent robustness. Bugs in
the existing driver prevent EH working correctly but this is addressed in
a subsequent patch. Remove USLEEP_WAITLONG.
