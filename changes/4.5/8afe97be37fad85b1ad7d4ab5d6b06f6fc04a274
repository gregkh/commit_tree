[media] uvcvideo: Enable UVC 1.5 device detection

UVC 1.5 devices report a bInterfaceProtocol value set to 1 in their
interface descriptors. The uvcvideo driver only matches on
bInterfaceProtocol 0, preventing those devices from being detected.

More changes to the driver are needed for full UVC 1.5 compatibility.
However, at least the UVC 1.5 Microsoft Surface Pro 3 cameras have been
reported to work out of the box with the driver with an updated match
table.

Enable UVC 1.5 support in the match table to support the devices that
can work with the current driver implementation. Devices that can't will
fail, but that's hardly a regression as they're currently not detected
at all anyway.
