ALSA: hda - Skip ELD notification during PM process

The ELD notification can be received asynchronously from the graphics
side, and this may happen just at the moment the sound driver is
processing the suspend or the resume, and it would confuse the whole
procedure.  Since the ELD and connection states are updated in anyway
at the end of the resume, we can skip it when received during PM
process.
