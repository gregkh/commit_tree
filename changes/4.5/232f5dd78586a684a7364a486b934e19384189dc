s390/oprofile: fix address range for asynchronous stack

git commit dc7ee00d4771 ("s390: lowcore stack pointer offsets")
introduced a regression in regard to s390_backtrace(). The stack
pointer for the asynchronous stack in the lowcore now has an
additional offset applied. This offset needs to be taken into account
in the calculation for the low and high address for the stack.

This bug was already partially fixed with commit 9cc5c206d9b4
("s390/dumpstack: fix address ranges for asynchronous and panic
stack"). This patch fixes it also for the oprofile code.
