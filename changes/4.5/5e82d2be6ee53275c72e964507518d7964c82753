ASoC: dpcm: fix the BE state on hw_free

While performing hw_free, DPCM checks the BE state but leaves out
the suspend state. The suspend state needs to be checked as well,
as we might be suspended and then usermode closes rather than
resuming the audio stream.

This was found by a stress testing of system with playback in
loop and killed after few seconds running in background and second
script running suspend-resume test in loop
