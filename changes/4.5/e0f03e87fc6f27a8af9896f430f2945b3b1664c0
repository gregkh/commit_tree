PNP: respect PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE when detaching

I have a device (Nuvoton 6779D Super-IO IR RC with nuvoton-cir driver)
which works after initial boot but not any longer if I unload and
re-load the driver module.

Digging into the issue I found that unloading the driver calls
pnp_disable_dev although the driver has flag PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE
set. IMHO this is not right.

Let's have a look at the call chain when probing a device:
pnp_device_probe
1. attaches the device
2. if it's not active and PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE is not set
   it gets activated
3. probes driver

I think pnp_device_remove should do it in reverse order and also
respect PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE. Therefore:
1. call drivers remove callback
2. if device is active and PNP_DRIVER_RES_DO_NOT_CHANGE is not set
   disable it
3. detach device

The change works for me and sounds logical to me.
However I don't know the pnp driver in detail so I might be wrong.
