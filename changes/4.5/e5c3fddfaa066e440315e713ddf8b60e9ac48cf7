ncr5380: Remove command list debug code

Some NCR5380 hosts offer a .show_info method to access the contents of
the various command list data structures from a procfs file. When NDEBUG
is set, the same information is sent to the console during EH.

The two core drivers, atari_NCR5380.c and NCR5380.c differ here. Because
it is just for debugging, the easiest way to fix the discrepancy is
simply remove this code.

The only remaining users of NCR5380_show_info() and NCR5380_write_info()
are drivers that define PSEUDO_DMA. The others have no use for the
.show_info method, so don't initialize it.
