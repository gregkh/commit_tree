rcu: Create transitive rnp->lock acquisition functions

Providing RCU's memory-ordering guarantees requires that the rcu_node
tree's locking provide transitive memory ordering, which the Linux kernel's
spinlocks currently do not provide unless smp_mb__after_unlock_lock()
is used.  Having a separate smp_mb__after_unlock_lock() after each and
every lock acquisition is error-prone, hard to read, and a bit annoying,
so this commit provides wrapper functions that pull in the
smp_mb__after_unlock_lock() invocations.
