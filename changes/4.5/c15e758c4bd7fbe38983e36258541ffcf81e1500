perf build: Pass O option to kernel makefile in build-test

Kernel makefile only follows an 'O' option passed from command line
explicitely. In build-test with 'O' option set, kernel makefile
contaminate kernel source directory. Build test also fail if we don't
create output directory manually.

K_O_OPT is added and passed to kernel makefile if 'O' is passed
to build-test.
