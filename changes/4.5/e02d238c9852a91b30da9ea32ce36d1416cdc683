zram/zcomp: do not zero out zcomp private pages

Do not __GFP_ZERO allocated zcomp ->private pages.  We keep allocated
streams around and use them for read/write requests, so we supply a
zeroed out ->private to compression algorithm as a scratch buffer only
once -- the first time we use that stream.  For the rest of IO requests
served by this stream ->private usually contains some temporarily data
from the previous requests.
