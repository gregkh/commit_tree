KVM: vmx: detect mismatched size in VMCS read/write

Signed-off-by: Paolo Bonzini <pbonzini@redhat.com>

	I am sending this as RFC because the error messages it produces are
	very ugly.  Because of inlining, the original line is lost.  The
	alternative is to change vmcs_read/write/checkXX into macros, but
	then you need to have a single huge BUILD_BUG_ON or BUILD_BUG_ON_MSG
	because multiple BUILD_BUG_ON* with the same __LINE__ are not
	supported well.
