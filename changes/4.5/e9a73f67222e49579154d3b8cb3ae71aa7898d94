WHENCE: use https://linuxtv.org for LinuxTV URLs

While https was always supported on linuxtv.org, only in
Dec 3 2015 the website is using valid certificates.

As we're planning to drop pure http support on some
future, change the http://linuxtv.org references at firmware/WHENCE
file to point to https://linuxtv.org instead.
