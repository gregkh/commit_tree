[media] media-entity: protect object creation/removal using spin lock

Some parts of the media controller are using mutexes while
others are using spin locks in order to protect creation
and removal of elements in the graph. That's wrong!

Also, the V4L2 core can remove graph elements on non-interactive
context:
	BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at include/linux/sched.h:2776

Fix it by always using spin locks for graph element addition/removal,
just like entity creation/removal is protected at media-device.c
