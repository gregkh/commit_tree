ALSA: dice: split subaddress check from category check

Before allocating an instance of sound card, ALSA dice driver checks
chip_ID_hi in Bus information block of Config ROM, then also checks
subaddresses. The former operation reads cache of Config ROM in Linux
FireWire subsystem, while the latter operation sends read transaction.
The latter can be merged into initialization of transaction system.

This commit splits these two operations to reduce needless transactions
in probe processing.
