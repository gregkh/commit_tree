thp: change deferred_split_count() to return number of THP in queue

I've got meaning of shrinker::count_objects() wrong: it should return
number of potentially freeable objects, which is not necessary correlate
with freeable memory.

Returning 256 per THP in queue is not reasonable:
shrinker::scan_objects() never called with nr_to_scan > 128 in my setup.

Let's return 1 per THP and correct scan_object accordingly.
