cxl: Fix possible idr warning when contexts are released

An idr warning is reported when a context is release after the capi card
is unbound from the cxl driver via sysfs. Below are the steps to
reproduce:

1. Create multiple afu contexts in an user-space application using libcxl.
2. Unbind capi card from cxl using command of form
   echo <capi-card-pci-addr> > /sys/bus/pci/drivers/cxl-pci/unbind
3. Exit/kill the application owning afu contexts.

After above steps a warning message is usually seen in the kernel logs
of the form "idr_remove called for id=<context-id> which is not
allocated."

This is caused by the function cxl_release_afu which destroys the
contexts_idr table. So when a context is release no entry for context pe
is found in the contexts_idr table and idr code prints this warning.

This patch fixes this issue by increasing & decreasing the ref-count on
the afu device when a context is initialized or when its freed
respectively. This prevents the afu from being released until all the
afu contexts have been released. The patch introduces two new functions
namely cxl_afu_get/put that manage the ref-count on the afu device.

Also the patch removes code inside cxl_dev_context_init that increases ref
on the afu device as its guaranteed to be alive during this function.
