ACPI / video: Add quirks for the Dell Vostro V131

The Dell Vostro V131 has an especially broken acpi-video implementation.

The backlight control bits work, but when the brightness is changed via
the acpi-video interface the backlight flickers annoyingly before settling
at the new brightness, switching to using the native interface fixes the
flickering so add a quirk for this (the vendor interface has the same
problem).

Brightness keypresses reported through the acpi-video-bus are also broken,
they get reported one event delayed, so if you press the brightness-up
hotkey on the keyboard nothing happens, then if you press brightness-down,
the previous brightness-up event gets reported. Since the keypresses are
also reported via wmi (if active) and via atkbd (when wmi is not active)
add a quirk to simply filter out the delayed (broken) events.
