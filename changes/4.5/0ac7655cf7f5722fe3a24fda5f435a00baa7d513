drm/i915: Add dmc firmware load state and version to error state

We have had one case where buggy csr/dmc firmware version influenced
gt side and caused a hang. Add dmc firmware loading state and
version to error state.

v2: - Rebased on top of Damien's patches
    - included fw load state
v3: include dmc info only if platform supports it (Chris)
v4: move *csr to branch scope (Chris)
v5: remove dependency to csr_state
