ata: ahci: don't mark HotPlugCapable Ports as external/removable

The HPCP bit is set by bioses for on-board sata ports either because
they think sata is hotplug capable in general or to allow Windows
to display a "device eject" icon on ports which are routed to an
external connector bracket.

However in Redhat Bugzilla #1310682, users report that with kernel 4.4,
where this bit test first appeared, a lot of partitions on sata drives
are now mounted automatically.

This patch should fix redhat and a lot of other distros which
unconditionally automount all devices which have the "removable"
bit set.
