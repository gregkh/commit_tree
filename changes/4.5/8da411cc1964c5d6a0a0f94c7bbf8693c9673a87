clk: let of_clk_get_parent_name() fail for invalid clock-indices

Currently, of_clk_get_parent_name() returns a wrong parent clock name
when "clock-indices" property exists and the target index is not
found in the property.  In this case, NULL should be returned.

For example,

        oscillator {
                compatible = "myclocktype";
                #clock-cells = <1>;
                clock-indices = <1>, <3>;
                clock-output-names = "clka", "clkb";
        };

        consumer {
                compatible = "myclockconsumer";
                clocks = <&oscillator 0>, <&oscillator 1>;
        };

Currently, of_clk_get_parent_name(consumer_np, 0) returns "clka"
(and of_clk_get_parent_name(consumer_np, 1) also returns "clka",
this is correct).   Because the "clock-indices" in the clock parent
does not contain <0>, of_clk_get_parent_name(consumer_np, 0) should
return NULL.
