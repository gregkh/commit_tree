[media] media: i2c: Don't export ir-kbd-i2c module alias

This is a partial revert of commit ed8d1cf07cb16d ("[media] Export I2C
module alias information in missing drivers") that exported the module
aliases for the I2C drivers that were missing to make autoload to work.

But there is a bug report [0] that auto load of the ir-kbd-i2c driver
cause the Hauppauge HD-PVR driver to not behave correctly.

This is a hdpvr latent bug that was just exposed by ir-kbd-i2c module
autoloading working and will also happen if the I2C driver is built-in
or a user calls modprobe to load the module and register the driver.

But there is a regression experimented by users so until the real bug
is fixed, let's not export the module alias for the ir-kbd-i2c driver
even when this just masks the actual issue.
