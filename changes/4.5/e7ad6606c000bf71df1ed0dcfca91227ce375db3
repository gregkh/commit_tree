drm/exynos: dsi: restore support for drm bridge

This patch fixes issue introduced by commit
cf67cc9a29ac19c98bc4fa0e6d14b0c1f592d322 ("drm/exynos: remove struct
exynos_drm_display"), which removed assigning of drm bridge to drm
encoder. Lack of it caused that no bridge callbacks were called on
encoder enable/disable actions.
