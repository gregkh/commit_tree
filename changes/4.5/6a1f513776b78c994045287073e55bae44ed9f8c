x86/xen: don't reset vcpu_info on a cancelled suspend

On a cancelled suspend the vcpu_info location does not change (it's
still in the per-cpu area registered by xen_vcpu_setup()).  So do not
call xen_hvm_init_shared_info() which would make the kernel think its
back in the shared info.  With the wrong vcpu_info, events cannot be
received and the domain will hang after a cancelled suspend.
