drm/amdgpu: only move pt bos in LRU list on success

This fixes a race condition in the error case: since the pt bos have not
necessarily been reserved in case of an error, we could move a pt bo that
is currently in the middle of being evicted/moved by another process,
which then resulted in a BUG_ON in ttm_bo_add_to_lru.
