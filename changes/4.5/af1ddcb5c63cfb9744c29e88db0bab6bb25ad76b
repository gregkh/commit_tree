m32r: fix build failure due to SMP and MMU

One of the randconfig build failed with the error:

  arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c: In function 'smp_flush_tlb_mm':
  arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c:283:20: error: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer nor vector
    mmc = &mm->context[cpu_id];
                      ^
  arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c: In function 'smp_flush_tlb_page':
  arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c:353:20: error: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer nor vector
    mmc = &mm->context[cpu_id];
                      ^
  arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c: In function 'smp_invalidate_interrupt':
  arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c:479:41: error: subscripted value is neither array nor pointer nor vector
    unsigned long *mmc = &flush_mm->context[cpu_id];

It turned out that CONFIG_SMP was defined but CONFIG_MMU was not
defined.  But arch/m32r/include/asm/mmu.h only defines mm_context_t as
an array when both CONFIG_SMP and CONFIG_MMU are defined.  And
arch/m32r/kernel/smp.c is always using context as an array.  So without
MMU SMP can not work.
