watchdog: Create watchdog device in watchdog_dev.c

The watchdog character device is currently created in watchdog_dev.c,
and the watchdog device in watchdog_core.c. This results in
cross-dependencies, since device creation needs to know the watchdog
character device number as well as the watchdog class, both of which
reside in watchdog_dev.c.

Create the watchdog device in watchdog_dev.c to simplify the code.

Inspired by earlier patch set from Damien Riegel.
