powerpc/pseries: Don't trace hcalls on offline CPUs

If a cpu is hotplugged while the hcall trace points are active, it's
possible to hit a warning from RCU due to the trace points calling into
RCU from an offline cpu, eg:

  RCU used illegally from offline CPU!
  rcu_scheduler_active = 1, debug_locks = 1

Make the hypervisor tracepoints conditional by using
TRACE_EVENT_FN_COND.
