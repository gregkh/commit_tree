dax: never rely on bh.b_dev being set by get_block()

Previously in DAX we assumed that calls to get_block() would set
bh.b_bdev, and we would then use that value even in error cases for
debugging.  This caused a NULL pointer dereference in __dax_dbg() which
was fixed by a previous commit, but that commit only changed the one
place where we were hitting an error.

Instead, update dax.c so that we always initialize bh.b_bdev as best we
can based on the information that DAX has.  get_block() may or may not
update to a new value, but this at least lets us get something helpful
from bh.b_bdev for error messages and not have to worry about whether it
was set by get_block() or not.
