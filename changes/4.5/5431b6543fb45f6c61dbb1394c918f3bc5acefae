ACPICA: Linuxize: reduce divergences for 20151218 release

The patch reduces source code differences between the Linux kernel and the
ACPICA upstream so that the linuxized ACPICA 20151218 release can be
applied with reduced human intervention.

The pscode.c has already been out of sync for months, and it becomes more
and more difficult to merge pscode.c changes, so instead of update the
affected lines of pscode.c, this patch synchronizes entire pscode.c file.
