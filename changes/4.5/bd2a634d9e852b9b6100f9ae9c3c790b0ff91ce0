tracepoints: Move struct tracepoint to new tracepoint-defs.h header

Steven recommended open coding access to tracepoint->key to add
trace points to headers. Unfortunately this is difficult for some
headers (such as x86 asm/msr.h) because including tracepoint.h
includes so many other headers that it causes include loops.
The main problem is the include of linux/rcupdate.h, which
pulls in a lot of other headers. The rcu header is only needed
when actually defining trace points.

Move the struct tracepoint into a separate tracepoint-defs.h
header that can be included without pulling in all of RCU.
