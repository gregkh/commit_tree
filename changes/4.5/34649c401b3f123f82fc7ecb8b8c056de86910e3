drm: atmel-hlcdc: add support for sama5d2 SoCs

As the hardware description for this chip is the same as the sama5d4, we use
this SoC structures for layers and DC descriptions. Thus only 2 lines are added
to the atmel_hlcdc_of_match table.
The compatible string is already documented in the parent MFD driver's binding.
