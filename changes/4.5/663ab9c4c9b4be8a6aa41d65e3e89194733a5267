drm/gma500: Drop dev->struct_mutex from modeset code

It's either init code or already protected by other means. Note
that psb_gtt_pin/unpin has it's own lock, and that's really the
only piece of driver private state - all the modeset state is
protected with modeset locks already.

The only important bit is to switch all gem_obj_unref calls to the
_unlocked variant.
