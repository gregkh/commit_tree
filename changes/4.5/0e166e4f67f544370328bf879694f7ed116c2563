ACPICA: Debugger: reduce old external path format

ACPICA commit 75c0da9e796bdf9bdd46d75f028a3e1779903214

In the error logs and debugger outputs, use new external path format that
does not contain a trailing underscore.

This patch takes care of acpi_ns_get_external_pathname() invocations, chaning
them into acpi_ns_get_normalized_pathname(TRUE) where possible. Along with some
error log fixes, the following debugger commands are fixed: resources,
handlers, paths. Lv Zheng.
