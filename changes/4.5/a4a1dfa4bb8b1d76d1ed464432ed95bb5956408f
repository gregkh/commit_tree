ocfs2/cluster: fix memory leak in o2hb_region_release

o2hb_region_release currently doesn't free o2hb_debug_buf
hr_db_elapsed_time and hr_db_pinned malloced in o2hb_debug_create.  Also
we should call debugfs_remove before freeing its data, to prevent the risk
accessing debugfs rightly after its data has been freed.
