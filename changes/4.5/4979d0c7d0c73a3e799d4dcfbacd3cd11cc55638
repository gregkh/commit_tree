perf stat record: Add record command

Add 'perf stat record' command support. It creates simple (header only)
perf.data file ATM.

The record command could be specified anywhere among stat options. All
stat command options are valid for stat record command with '-o' option
exception. If specified for record command it denotes the perf data file
name.

Committer note:

Set sample_type to PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER, which should be harmless
while avoiding that older tools show confusing messages, for instance,
with sample_type = 0, we get:

  $ perf stat record usleep 1

   Performance counter stats for 'usleep 1':

While with sample_type set to PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER, after we re-run 'perf
stat record usleep' we get:

  $ oldperf evlist
  WARNING: The perf.data file's data size field is 0 which is unexpected.
  Was the 'perf record' command properly terminated?

  $

Which at least shows the names of the events in the perf.data file.

Additionally, such files, when passed to 'perf report' will produce:

  $ oldperf report --stdio
  WARNING: The perf.data file's data size field is 0 which is unexpected.
  Was the 'perf record' command properly terminated?
  Warning:
  Kernel address maps (/proc/{kallsyms,modules}) were restricted.

  Check /proc/sys/kernel/kptr_restrict before running 'perf record'.

  As no suitable kallsyms nor vmlinux was found, kernel samples
  can't be resolved.

  Samples in kernel modules can't be resolved as well.

  Error:
  The perf.data file has no samples!
  # To display the perf.data header info, please use --header/--header-only options.
  #
  $

Which is confusing and can be solved by just adding the kernel mmap record,
which will also remove that warning about the data size field being equal to
zero, after generating the mmap record:

  $ perf stat record usleep 1

No warnings, sensible output about what are the events in the perf.data file and also
a "file has no samples" message, which indeed it doesn't.
