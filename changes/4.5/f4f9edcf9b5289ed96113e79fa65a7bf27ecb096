staging/speakup: Use tty_ldisc_ref() for paste kworker

As the function documentation for tty_ldisc_ref_wait() notes, it is
only callable from a tty file_operations routine; otherwise there
is no guarantee the ref won't be NULL.

The key difference with the VT's paste_selection() is that is an ioctl,
where __speakup_paste_selection() is completely async kworker, kicked
off from interrupt context.

       tty (ab)usage to match vt")
