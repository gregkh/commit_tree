ALSA: seq: Fix incorrect sanity check at snd_seq_oss_synth_cleanup()

ALSA sequencer OSS emulation code has a sanity check for currently
opened devices, but there is a thinko there, eventually it spews
warnings and skips the operation wrongly like:
  WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7573 at sound/core/seq/oss/seq_oss_synth.c:311

Fix this off-by-one error.
