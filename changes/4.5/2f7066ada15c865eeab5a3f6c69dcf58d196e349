openvswitch: fix struct geneve_port member name

commit 6b001e682e90 ("openvswitch: Use Geneve device.")

The commit above introduced 'port_no' as the name for the member of
struct geneve_port. The correct name should be 'dst_port' as described
in the kernel doc. Let's fix that member name and all the pertinent
instances so that both doc and code would be consistent.
