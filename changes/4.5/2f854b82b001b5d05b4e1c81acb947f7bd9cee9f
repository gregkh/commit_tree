ncr5380: Sleep when polling, if possible

When in process context, sleep during polling if doing so won't add
significant latency. In interrupt context or if the lock is held, poll
briefly then give up. Keep both core drivers in sync.

Calibrate busy-wait iterations to allow for variation in chip register
access times between different 5380 hardware implementations.
