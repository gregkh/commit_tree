powerpc/64: Include KVM guest test in all interrupt vectors

Currently, if HV KVM is configured but PR KVM isn't, we don't include
a test to see whether we were interrupted in KVM guest context for the
set of interrupts which get delivered directly to the guest by hardware
if they occur in the guest.  This includes things like program
interrupts.

However, the recent bug where userspace could set the MSR for a VCPU
to have an illegal value in the TS field, and thus cause a TM Bad Thing
type of program interrupt on the hrfid that enters the guest, showed that
we can never be completely sure that these interrupts can never occur
in the guest entry/exit code.  If one of these interrupts does happen
and we have HV KVM configured but not PR KVM, then we end up trying to
run the handler in the host with the MMU set to the guest MMU context,
which generally ends badly.

Thus, for robustness it is better to have the test in every interrupt
vector, so that if some way is found to trigger some interrupt in the
guest entry/exit path, we can handle it without immediately crashing
the host.

This means that the distinction between KVMTEST and KVMTEST_PR goes
away.  Thus we delete KVMTEST_PR and associated macros and use KVMTEST
everywhere that we previously used either KVMTEST_PR or KVMTEST.  It
also means that SOFTEN_TEST_HV_201 becomes the same as SOFTEN_TEST_PR,
so we deleted SOFTEN_TEST_HV_201 and use SOFTEN_TEST_PR instead.
