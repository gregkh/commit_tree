KVM: s390: don't load kvm without virtualization support

If we don't have support for virtualization (SIE), e.g. when running under
a hypervisor not supporting execution of the SIE instruction, we should
immediately abort loading the kvm module, as the SIE instruction cannot
be enabled dynamically.

Currently, the SIE instructions fails with an exception on a non-SIE
host, resulting in the guest making no progress, instead of failing hard.
