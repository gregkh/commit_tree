perf/x86: Fix filter_events() bug with event mappings

This patch fixes a bug in the filter_events() function.

The patch fixes the bug whereby if some mappings did not
exist, e.g., STALLED_CYCLES_FRONTEND, then any event after it
in the attrs array would disappear from the published list of
events in /sys/devices/cpu/events. This could be verified
easily on any system post SNB (which do not publish
STALLED_CYCLES_FRONTEND):

	$ ./perf stat -e cycles,ref-cycles true
	Performance counter stats for 'true':
              1,217,348      cycles
	<not supported>      ref-cycles

The problem is that in filter_events() there is an assumption
that the argument (attrs) is organized in increasing continuous
event indexes related to the event_map(). But if we remove the
non-supported events by shifing the position in the array, then
the lookup x86_pmu.event_map() needs to compensate for it, otherwise
we are looking up the wrong index. This patch corrects this problem
by compensating for the deleted events and with that ref-cycles
reappears (here shown on Haswell):

	$ perf stat -e ref-cycles,cycles true
	Performance counter stats for 'true':
         4,525,910      ref-cycles
         1,064,920      cycles
       0.002943888 seconds time elapsed
