KVM: x86: MMU: Remove is_rmap_spte() and use is_shadow_present_pte()

is_rmap_spte(), originally named is_rmap_pte(), was introduced when the
simple reverse mapping was implemented by commit cd4a4e5374110444
("[PATCH] KVM: MMU: Implement simple reverse mapping").  At that point,
its role was clear and only rmap_add() and rmap_remove() were using it
to select sptes that need to be reverse-mapped.

Independently of that, is_shadow_present_pte() was first introduced by
commit c7addb902054195b ("KVM: Allow not-present guest page faults to
bypass kvm") to do bypass_guest_pf optimization, which does not exist
any more.

These two seem to have changed their roles somewhat, and is_rmap_spte()
just calls is_shadow_present_pte() now.

Since using both of them without clear distinction just makes the code
confusing, remove is_rmap_spte().
