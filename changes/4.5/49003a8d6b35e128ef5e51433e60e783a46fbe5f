arm64: don't call C code with el0's fp register

On entry from el0, we save all the registers on the kernel stack, and
restore them before returning. x29 remains unchanged when we call out
to C code, which will store x29 as the frame-pointer on the stack.

Instead, write 0 into x29 after entry from el0, to avoid any risk of
tracing into user space.
