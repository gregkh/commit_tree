powerpc/powernv: Fix stale PE primary bus

When PCI bus is unplugged during full hotplug for EEH recovery,
the platform PE instance (struct pnv_ioda_pe) isn't released and
it dereferences the stale PCI bus that has been released. It leads
to kernel crash when referring to the stale PCI bus.

This fixes the issue by correcting the PE's primary bus when it's
oneline at plugging time, in pnv_pci_dma_bus_setup() which is to
be called by pcibios_fixup_bus().
