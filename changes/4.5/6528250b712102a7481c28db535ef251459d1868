xfs: support a crc verification only log record pass

Log recovery torn write detection uses CRC verification over a range of
the active log to identify torn writes. Since the generic log recovery
pass code implements a superset of the functionality required for CRC
verification, it can be easily modified to support a CRC verification
only pass.

Create a new CRC pass type and update the log record processing helper
to skip everything beyond CRC verification when in this mode. This pass
will be invoked in subsequent patches to implement torn write detection.
