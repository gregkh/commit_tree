pNFS/flexfiles: Don't mark the entire layout as failed, when returning it

In pNFS/flexfiles, we want to return the layout without necessarily marking
it as having completely failed. We therefore move the call to
pnfs_layout_io_set_failed() out of pnfs_error_mark_layout_for_return(),
and then ensura that pNFS/files layout calls it separately.
