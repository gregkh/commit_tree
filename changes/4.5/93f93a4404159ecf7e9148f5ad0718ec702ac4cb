net: move skb_mark_napi_id() into core networking stack

We would like to automatically provide busy polling support
to all NAPI drivers, without them having to implement anything.

skb_mark_napi_id() can be called from napi_gro_receive() and
napi_get_frags().

Few drivers are still calling skb_mark_napi_id() because
they use netif_receive_skb(). They should eventually call
napi_gro_receive() instead. I will leave this to drivers
maintainers.
