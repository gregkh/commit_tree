tcm_loop: Show address of tpg in configfs

In the past, the scsi_host's number wasn't shown anywhere, user have
to depends on vpg_83 to find the block device, which is also depends
on backstore implementation.

It's better for tcm_loop to provide necessary straightforward
information on locate the block device it created.

This patch would help to locate the block device created by tcm_loop.
The address would be shown at e.g.

  /sys/kernel/config/target/loopback/naa.60014059436855c1/tpgt_1/address

which would looks like "2:0:1", and the lun number can be found at
"/tpgt_1/lun/lun_0".  Altogether they formated the scsi address of
device as "2:0:1:0", which can be used to locate the device easily
through 'lsscsi'.

(Update to >= v4.4-rc1 configfs attribute usage - nab)
