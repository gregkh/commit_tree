kbuild: add AFLAGS_REMOVE_(basename).o option

It is already possible to remove CFLAGS with the CFLAGS_REMOVE option
that was introduced with commit 656ee82cc855 ("kbuild: create new
CFLAGS_REMOVE_(basename).o option").  However it is not possible to
remove AFLAGS for assembler files.

So this patch just adds the AFLAGS_REMOVE option which works the same
like CFLAGS_REMOVE.
