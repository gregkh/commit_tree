IB/IPoIB: Fix kernel panic on multicast flow

ipoib_mcast_restart_task calls ipoib_mcast_remove_list with the
parameter mcast->dev. That mcast is a temporary (used as an iterator)
variable that may be uninitialized.
There is no need to send the variable dev to the function, as each mcast
has its dev as a member in the mcast struct.

This causes the next panic:
RIP: 0010: ipoib_mcast_leave+0x6d/0xf0 [ib_ipoib]
RSP: 0018: EFLAGS: 00010246
RAX: f0201 RBX: 24e00 RCX: 00000
....
....
Stack:
