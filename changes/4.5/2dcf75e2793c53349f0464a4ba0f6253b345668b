net: mvneta: Associate RX queues with each CPU

We enable the percpu interrupt for all the CPU and we just associate a
CPU to a few queue at the neta level. The mapping between the CPUs and
the queues is static. The queues are associated to the CPU module the
number of CPUs. However currently we only use on RX queue for a given
Ethernet port.
