perf ui/tui: Print helpline message as is

When a tip message contains a percent sign, it was treated printf format
specifier so broken string was printed like below.

  Tip: Limit to show entries above 577nly: perf report --percent-limit 5
                                   ^^^

As ui_browser__show receives format string, pass additional "%s" so that
the help (tip) message can be printed as is.

  Tip: Limit to show entries above 5% only: perf report --percent-limit 5
