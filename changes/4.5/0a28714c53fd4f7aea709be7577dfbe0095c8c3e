arm64: Use PoU cache instr for I/D coherency

In systems with three levels of cache(PoU at L1 and PoC at L3),
PoC cache flush instructions flushes L2 and L3 caches which could affect
performance.
For cache flushes for I and D coherency, PoU should suffice.
So changing all I and D coherency related cache flushes to PoU.

Introduced a new __clean_dcache_area_pou API for dcache flush till PoU
and provided a common macro for __flush_dcache_area and
__clean_dcache_area_pou.

Also, now in __sync_icache_dcache, icache invalidation for non-aliasing
VIPT icache is done only for that particular page instead of the earlier
__flush_icache_all.
