arm64: hugetlb: add support for PTE contiguous bit

The arm64 MMU supports a Contiguous bit which is a hint that the TTE
is one of a set of contiguous entries which can be cached in a single
TLB entry.  Supporting this bit adds new intermediate huge page sizes.

The set of huge page sizes available depends on the base page size.
Without using contiguous pages the huge page sizes are as follows.

 4KB:   2MB  1GB
64KB: 512MB

With a 4KB granule, the contiguous bit groups together sets of 16 pages
and with a 64KB granule it groups sets of 32 pages.  This enables two new
huge page sizes in each case, so that the full set of available sizes
is as follows.

 4KB:  64KB   2MB  32MB  1GB
64KB:   2MB 512MB  16GB

If a 16KB granule is used then the contiguous bit groups 128 pages
at the PTE level and 32 pages at the PMD level.

If the base page size is set to 64KB then 2MB pages are enabled by
default.  It is possible in the future to make 2MB the default huge
page size for both 4KB and 64KB granules.
