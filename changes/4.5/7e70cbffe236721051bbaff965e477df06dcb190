usb: xhci: add a quirk bit for ssic port unused

Two workarounds introduced by commit b8cb91e058cd ("xhci: Workaround
for PME stuck issues in Intel xhci") and commit abce329c27b3 ("xhci:
Workaround to get D3 working in Intel xHCI") share a single quirk bit
XHCI_PME_STUCK_QUIRK. These two workarounds actually are different and
might happen on different hardwares. Need to separate them by adding a
quirk bit for the later.
