ixgbe: Handle extended IPv6 headers in Tx path

Check for and handle IPv6 extended headers so that Tx checksum
offload can be done. Also use skb_checksum_help for unexpected
cases. Thanks to Tom Herbert for noticing these problems. Thanks
to Alexander Duyck for recognizing problems with the first version
of this patch and recognizing how to coalesce error conditions
into a single location.
