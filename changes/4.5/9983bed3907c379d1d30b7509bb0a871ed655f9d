scsi: Add scsi_vpd_lun_id()

Add a function scsi_vpd_lun_id() to return a unique device
identifcation based on the designation descriptors of
VPD page 0x83.

As devices might implement several descriptors the order
of preference is:
- NAA IEE Registered Extended
- EUI-64 based 16-byte
- EUI-64 based 12-byte
- NAA IEEE Registered
- NAA IEEE Extended
A SCSI name string descriptor is preferred to all of them
if the identification is longer than 16 bytes.

The returned unique device identification will be formatted
as a SCSI Name string to avoid clashes between different
designator types.
