cifs_dbg() outputs an uninitialized buffer in cifs_readdir()

In some cases tmp_bug can be not filled in cifs_filldir and stay uninitialized,
therefore its printk with "%s" modifier can leak content of kernelspace memory.
If old content of this buffer does not contain '\0' access bejond end of
allocated object can crash the host.
