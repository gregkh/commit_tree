MAINTAINERS: Update mailing list for Renesas SoC Development

Update the mailing list used for development of support for
Renesas SoCs and related drivers.

Up until now the linux-sh mailing list has been used, however,
Renesas SoCs are now much wider than the SH architecture and there
is some desire from some for the linux-sh list to refocus on
discussion of the work on the SH architecture.
