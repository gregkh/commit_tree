drm: Do not set connector->encoder in drivers

An encoder is associated with a connector by the DRM core as a result of
setting up a configuration. Drivers using the atomic or legacy helpers
should never set up this link, even if it is a static one.

While at it, try to catch this kind of error in the future by adding a
WARN_ON() in drm_mode_connector_attach_encoder(). Note that this doesn't
cover all the cases, since drivers could set this up after attaching.
Drivers that use the atomic helpers will get a warning later on, though,
so hopefully the two combined cover enough to help people avoid this in
the future.
