drm/i915/gen9: flush DMC fw loading work during system suspend

Currently during system s/r we enable/disable DC6, so before we do so
make sure that the firmware loading is complete.

Note that whether we need to enable DC6 for S3/S4 is still open.  At
least the firmware program is lost during S3 and we need to reprogram it
after resuming. Until this is clarified we keep the current behavior and
enable/disable DC6.
