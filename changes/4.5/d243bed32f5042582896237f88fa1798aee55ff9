ahci: Workaround for ThunderX Errata#22536

Due to Errata in ThunderX, HOST_IRQ_STAT should be
cleared before leaving the interrupt handler.
The patch attempts to satisfy the need.

Changes from V2:
	- removed newfile
	- code is now under CONFIG_ARM64

Changes from V1:
	- Rebased on top of libata/for-4.6
        - Moved ThunderX intr handler to new file

tj: Minor adjustments to comments.
