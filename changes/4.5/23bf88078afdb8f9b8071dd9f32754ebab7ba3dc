bpf: fix misleading comment in bpf_convert_filter

Comment says "User BPF's register A is mapped to our BPF register 6",
which is actually wrong as the mapping is on register 0. This can
already be inferred from the code itself. So just remove it before
someone makes assumptions based on that. Only code tells truth. ;)
