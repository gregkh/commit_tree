batman-adv: Drop immediate orig_node free function

It is not allowed to free the memory of an object which is part of a list
which is protected by rcu-read-side-critical sections without making sure
that no other context is accessing the object anymore. This usually happens
by removing the references to this object and then waiting until the rcu
grace period is over and no one (allowedly) accesses it anymore.

But the _now functions ignore this completely. They free the object
directly even when a different context still tries to access it. This has
to be avoided and thus these functions must be removed and all functions
have to use batadv_orig_node_free_ref.
