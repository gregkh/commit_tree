netprio_cgroup: limit the maximum css->id to USHRT_MAX

netprio builds per-netdev contiguous priomap array which is indexed by
css->id.  The array is allocated using kzalloc() effectively limiting
the maximum ID supported to some thousand range.  This patch caps the
maximum supported css->id to USHRT_MAX which should be way above what
is actually useable.

This allows reducing sock->sk_cgrp_prioidx to u16 from u32.  The freed
up part will be used to overload the cgroup related fields.
sock->sk_cgrp_prioidx's position is swapped with sk_mark so that the
two cgroup related fields are adjacent.
