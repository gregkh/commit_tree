cgroup: Fix uninitialized variable warning

Commit 1f7dd3e5a6e4 ("cgroup: fix handling of multi-destination migration
from subtree_control enabling") introduced the following compiler warning:

mm/memcontrol.c: In function ‘mem_cgroup_can_attach’:
mm/memcontrol.c:4790:9: warning: ‘memcg’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
   mc.to = memcg;
         ^

Fix this by initializing 'memcg' to NULL.

This was found using gcc (GCC) 4.9.2 20150212 (Red Hat 4.9.2-6).
