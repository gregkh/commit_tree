mm/hugetlb.c: fix incorrect proc nr_hugepages value

Currently incorrect default hugepage pool size is reported by proc
nr_hugepages when number of pages for the default huge page size is
specified twice.

When multiple huge page sizes are supported, /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages
indicates the current number of pre-allocated huge pages of the default
size.  Basically /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages displays default_hstate->
max_huge_pages and after boot time pre-allocation, max_huge_pages should
equal the number of pre-allocated pages (nr_hugepages).

Test case:

Note that this is specific to x86 architecture.

Boot the kernel with command line option 'default_hugepagesz=1G
hugepages=X hugepagesz=2M hugepages=Y hugepagesz=1G hugepages=Z'.  After
boot, 'cat /proc/sys/vm/nr_hugepages' and 'sysctl -a | grep hugepages'
returns the value X.  However, dmesg output shows that Z huge pages were
pre-allocated.

So, the root cause of the problem here is that the global variable
default_hstate_max_huge_pages is set if a default huge page size is
specified (directly or indirectly) on the command line.  After the command
line processing in hugetlb_init, if default_hstate_max_huge_pages is set,
the value is assigned to default_hstae.max_huge_pages.  However,
default_hstate.max_huge_pages may have already been set based on the
number of pre-allocated huge pages of default_hstate size.

The solution to this problem is if hstate->max_huge_pages is already set
then it should not set as a result of global max_huge_pages value.
Basically if the value of the variable hugepages is set multiple times on
a command line for a specific supported hugepagesize then proc layer
should consider the last specified value.
