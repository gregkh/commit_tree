serial: 8250_pci: Add Intel Broadwell ports

Some recent (early 2015) macbooks have Intel Broadwell where LPSS UARTs are
PCI enumerated instead of ACPI. The LPSS UART block is pretty much same as
used on Intel Baytrail so we can reuse the existing Baytrail setup code.

Add both Broadwell LPSS UART ports to the list of supported devices.
