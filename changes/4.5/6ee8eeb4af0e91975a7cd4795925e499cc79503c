ALSA: hda - Less grumbling about lack of i915 binding

The recent commit [6603249dcdbb: ALSA: hda - Enable audio component
for old Intel PCH devices] enabled the i915 binding for HDMI/DP on old
Intel PCHs.  But many boards are without HDMI/DP, and they actually
don't need i915 binding, and yet the driver has a check of i915
binding and complains like
	Haswell must be built with CONFIG_SND_HDA_I915
This error is false-positive, and it should be put only for HSW/BDW,
instead of all devices that may be bound with i915.

This patch fixes the condition to check, as well as rephrasing the
message specific to HSW/BDW HDMI/DP.
