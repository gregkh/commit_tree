[media] s5k6a3: Fix VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT ioctl for TRY format

VIDIOC_SUBDEV_G_FMT ioctl should return TRY format previously
set with VIDIOC_SUBDEV_S_FMT. Currently it is not the case as
only ACTIVE formats are saved in the driver. Since the driver
doesn't alter hardware state in the set_fmt op anyway, the
op can save the format in both TRY and ACTIVE case.
