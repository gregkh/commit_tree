metag: define __smp_xxx

This defines __smp_xxx barriers for metag,
for use by virtualization.

smp_xxx barriers are removed as they are
defined correctly by asm-generic/barriers.h

Note: as __smp_XX macros should not depend on CONFIG_SMP, they can not
use the existing fence() macro since that is defined differently between
SMP and !SMP.  For this reason, this patch introduces a wrapper
metag_fence() that doesn't depend on CONFIG_SMP.
fence() is then defined using that, depending on CONFIG_SMP.
