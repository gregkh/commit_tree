ACPICA: Cleanup code related to the per-table module level improvement

ACPICA commit 071eff738c59eda1792ac24b3b688b61691d7e7c

This patch collects cleanups from per-table module level improvement. By
splitting this patch from that commit, we can make per-table module level
improvement clearer for the revewers. This is a no-op change.
