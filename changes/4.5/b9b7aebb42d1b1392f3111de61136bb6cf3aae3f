arm64: fix COMPAT_SHMLBA definition for large pages

ARM glibc uses (4 * __getpagesize()) for SHMLBA, which is correct for
4KB pages and works fine for 64KB pages, but the kernel uses a hardcoded
16KB that is too small for 64KB page based kernels. This changes the
definition to what user space sees when using 64KB pages.
