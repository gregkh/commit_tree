tty: amba-pl011: add support for ZTE UART (EXPERIMENTAL)

Add (incomplete) support for the ZTE UART to the AMBA PL011 driver.
This is similar to the ARM and ST variants, except it has a different
register address layout, and requires 32-bit accesses to the registers.
Use the newly introduced register tables and access size support to
cope with these differences.
