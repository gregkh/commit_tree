PM / OPP: Add debugfs support

This patch adds debugfs support to OPP layer to export OPPs and their
properties for all the devices.

This creates a top level directory: /sys/kernel/debug/opp and then
device specific directories (based on device names) inside it. For
example: 'cpu0', 'cpu1', etc..

If multiple devices share the OPP table, then the real directory is
created only for the first device. For all others, links are created to
the real directory.

Inside the device specific directory, a separate directory is created
for each OPP. And within that files per opp property.
