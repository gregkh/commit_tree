staging: comedi: adv_pci_dio: remove board reset during (*detach)

The board reset function disables and clears all interrupts. It also
resets all the digital output channels to 0.

Interrupts are not used by this driver so the disable/clear during the
(*detach) is not necessary.

Reseting all the digital outputs to 0 might not be desired depending
on what the outputs are connected to.

Remove the board reset and just use comedi_pci_detach() directly for
the driver (*detach).
