include/linux/memblock.h: fix ordering of 'flags' argument in comments

for_each_free_mem_range() and for_each_free_mem_range_reverse() both
accept a 'flags' argument, the comment surrounding the macro placed the
'flags' documentation at the very end, while 'flags' is in fact the 3rd
argument to the macro, so let's preserve natural ordering here.
