arm64/efi: mark UEFI reserved regions as MEMBLOCK_NOMAP

Change the EFI memory reservation logic to use memblock_mark_nomap()
rather than memblock_reserve() to mark UEFI reserved regions as
occupied. In addition to reserving them against allocations done by
memblock, this will also prevent them from being covered by the linear
mapping.
