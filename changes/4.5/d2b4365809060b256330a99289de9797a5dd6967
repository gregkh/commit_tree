cpuset: Replace all instances of time_t with time64_t

The following patch replaces all instances of time_t with time64_t i.e.
change the type used for representing time from 32-bit to 64-bit. All
32-bit kernels to date use a signed 32-bit time_t type, which can only
represent time until January 2038. Since embedded systems running 32-bit
Linux are going to survive beyond that date, we have to change all
current uses, in a backwards compatible way.

The patch also changes the function get_seconds() that returns a 32-bit
integer to ktime_get_seconds() that returns seconds as 64-bit integer.

The patch changes the type of ticks from time_t to u32. We keep ticks as
32-bits as the function uses 32-bit arithmetic which would prove less
expensive than 64-bit arithmetic and the function is expected to be
called atleast once every 32 seconds.
