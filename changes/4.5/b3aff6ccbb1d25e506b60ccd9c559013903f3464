KVM: arm/arm64: Fix reference to uninitialised VGIC

Commit 4b4b4512da2a ("arm/arm64: KVM: Rework the arch timer to use
level-triggered semantics") brought the virtual architected timer
closer to the VGIC. There is one occasion were we don't properly
check for the VGIC actually having been initialized before, but
instead go on to check the active state of some IRQ number.
If userland hasn't instantiated a virtual GIC, we end up with a
kernel NULL pointer dereference:
=========
Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000

=========

Fix this by bailing out early of kvm_timer_flush_hwstate() if we don't
have a VGIC at all.
