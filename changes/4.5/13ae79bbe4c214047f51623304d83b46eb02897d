leds: core: Drivers shouldn't enforce SYNC/ASYNC brightness setting

This patch removes SET_BRIGHTNESS_ASYNC and SET_BRIGHTNESS_SYNC flags.
led_set_brightness() now calls led_set_brightness_nosleep() instead of
choosing between sync and async op basing on the flags defined by the
driver.

From now on, if a user wants to make sure that brightness will be set
synchronously, they have to use led_set_brightness_sync() API. It is now
being made publicly available since it has become apparent that it is
a caller who should decide whether brightness is to be set in
a synchronous or an asynchronous way.
