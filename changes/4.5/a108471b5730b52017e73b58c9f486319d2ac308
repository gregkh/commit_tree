cifs: Check uniqueid for SMB2+ and return -ESTALE if necessary

Commit 7196ac113a4f ("Fix to check Unique id and FileType when client
refer file directly.") checks whether the uniqueid of an inode has
changed when getting the inode info, but only when using the UNIX
extensions. Add a similar check for SMB2+, since this can be done
without an extra network roundtrip.
