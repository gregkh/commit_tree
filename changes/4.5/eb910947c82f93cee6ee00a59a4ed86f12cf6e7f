test: firmware_class: add asynchronous request trigger

We might want to test for bugs like that found in commit f9692b2699bd
("firmware: fix possible use after free on name on asynchronous
request"), where the asynchronous request API had race conditions.

Let's add a simple file that will launch the async request, then wait
until it's complete and report the status. It's not a true async test
(we're using a mutex + wait_for_completion(), so we can't get more than
one going at the same time), but it does help make sure the basic API is
sane, and it can catch some class of bugs.
