drm/vmwgfx: Fix a width / pitch mismatch on framebuffer updates

When the framebuffer is a vmwgfx dma buffer and a proxy surface is
created, the vmw_kms_update_proxy() function requires that the proxy
surface width and the framebuffer pitch are compatible, otherwise
display corruption occurs as seen in gnome-shell/native with software
3D. Since the framebuffer pitch is determined by user-space, allocate
a proxy surface the width of which is based on the framebuffer pitch
rather than on the framebuffer width.
