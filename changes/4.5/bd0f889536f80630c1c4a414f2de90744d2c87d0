perf evsel: Disable branch flags/cycles for --callgraph lbr

[The kernel patch needed for this is in tip now (b16a5b52eb9 perf/x86:
Add option to disable ...) So this user tools patch to make use of it
should be merged now]

Automatically disable collecting branch flags and cycles with
--call-graph lbr. This allows avoiding a bunch of extra MSR
reads in the PMI on Skylake.

When the kernel doesn't support the new flags they are automatically
cleared in the fallback code.

v2: Switch to use branch_sample_type instead of sample_type.
Adjust description.
Fix the fallback logic.
