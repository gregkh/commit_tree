Thermal: handle thermal zone device properly during system sleep

Current thermal code does not handle system sleep well because
1. the cooling device cooling state may be changed during suspend
2. the previous temperature reading becomes invalid after resumed because
   it is got before system sleep
3. updating thermal zone device during suspending/resuming
   is wrong because some devices may have already been suspended
   or may have not been resumed.

Thus, the proper way to do this is to cancel all thermal zone
device update requirements during suspend/resume, and after all
the devices have been resumed, reset and update every registered
thermal zone devices.

This also fixes a regression introduced by:
Commit 19593a1fb1f6 ("ACPI / fan: convert to platform driver")
Because, with above commit applied, all the fan devices are attached
to the acpi_general_pm_domain, and they are turned on by the pm_domain
automatically after resume, without the awareness of thermal core.
