ARM: dts: am4372: fix irq type for arm twd and global timer

As per ARM documentation
PPI(0) ID27 - global timer interrupt is rising-edge sensitive.
PPI(2) ID29 - twd interrupt is rising-edge sensitive.

and the same is proved by GIC distributor register value
GIC_DIST_CONFIG(0xC04) = 0x7DC00000.

Hence, set IRQ triggering type to IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING
for ARM TWD and Global timers.
