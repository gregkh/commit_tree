i40e: propagate properly

i40e_sync_vsi_filters() is the surly teenager of this driver. It says
it's going to report errors, but it doesn't actually do that most of the
time. And when it does, it leaves a mess.

Change this function to have a common exit point so it will properly
release the busy lock on the VSI. Propagate errors to the callers.
Finally, adjust a few callers to check for and deal with errors from
this function.
