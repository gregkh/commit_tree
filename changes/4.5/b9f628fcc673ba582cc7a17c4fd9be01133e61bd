mac80211: clear local->sched_scan_req properly on reconfig

On reconfig, in case of sched_scan_req->n_scan_plans > 1,
local->sched_scan_req was never cleared, although
cfg80211_sched_scan_stopped_rtnl() was called, resulting
in local->sched_scan_req holding a stale and preventing
further scheduled scan requests.

Clear it explicitly in this case.
