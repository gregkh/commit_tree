crypto: atmel-aes - rework crypto request completion

This patch introduces a new callback 'resume' in the struct atmel_aes_dev.
This callback is run to resume/complete the processing of the crypto
request when woken up by I/O events such as AES interrupts or DMA
completion.

This callback will help implementing the GCM mode support in further
patches.
