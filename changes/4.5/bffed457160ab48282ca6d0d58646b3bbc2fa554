blk-mq: Avoid memoryless numa node encoded in hctx numa_node

In architecture like powerpc, we can have cpus without any local memory
attached to it (a.k.a memoryless nodes). In such cases cpu to node mapping
can result in memory allocation hints for block hctx->numa_node populated
with node values which does not have real memory.

Instead use local_memory_node(), which is guaranteed to have memory.
local_memory_node is a noop in other architectures that does not support
memoryless nodes.
