e1000: clean up the checking logic

The checking logic needed some clean-up work, so we rewrite it by
checking for break first. With that change in place, we can even move
the second check for goto statement outside of the loop.

As this is merely a cleanup, no functional change is involved. The
questionable 'tmp != 0xFF' is intentionally left alone.
