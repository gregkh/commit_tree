mtd: nand: fix drivers abusing mtd->priv

The ->priv field of the mtd_info object attached to a nand_chip device
should point to the nand_chip device. The pxa and cafe drivers are
assigning this field their own private structure, which works fine as long
as the nand_chip field is the first one in the driver private struct but
seems a bit fragile.
Fix that by setting mtd->priv to point the nand_chip field and assigning
chip->priv to the private structure head.
