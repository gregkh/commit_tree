HID: sony: Refactor the output report sending functions

Refactor the output report sending functions to allow for the sending of output
reports without enqueuing a work item.  Output reports for any device can now be
sent via the send_output_report function pointer in the sony_sc struct which
points to the appropriate output function.  The individual state worker
functions have been replaced with a universal sony_state_worker function which
uses this function pointer.
