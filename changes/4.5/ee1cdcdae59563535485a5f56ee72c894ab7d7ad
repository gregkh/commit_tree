dmaengine: dw: disable BLOCK IRQs for non-cyclic xfer

The commit 2895b2cad6e7 ("dmaengine: dw: fix cyclic transfer callbacks")
re-enabled BLOCK interrupts with regard to make cyclic transfers work. However,
this change becomes a regression for non-cyclic transfers as interrupt counters
under stress test had been grown enormously (approximately per 4-5 bytes in the
UART loop back test).

Taking into consideration above enable BLOCK interrupts if and only if channel
is programmed to perform cyclic transfer.
