ASoC: hdac_hdmi: remove unused hdac_hdmi_query_pin_connlist

A recent rework removed the only user of the hdac_hdmi_query_pin_connlist
function, so we now get a warning when building the hdac_hdmi driver:

hdac_hdmi.c:313:12: warning: 'hdac_hdmi_query_pin_connlist' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

This removes the function, which makes the file build cleanly again.
