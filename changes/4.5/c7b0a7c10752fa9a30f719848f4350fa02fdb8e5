i2c: img-scb: add handle for Master halt interrupt

Master halt is issued after each byte of a transaction is processed in
IP version 3.3.
Master halt will stall the bus by holding the SCK line low until the
halt bit in the scb_general_control is cleared.

After the last byte of a transfer is processed we can use the Master
Halt interrupt to facilitate a repeated start transfer without
issuing a stop bit.
