MIPS: zboot: Avoid useless rebuilds

Add dummy.o to the targets list, and fill targets automatically from
$(vmlinuzobjs) to avoid having to maintain two lists.

When building with XZ compression copy ashldi3.c to the build
directory to use a different object file for the kernel and zboot.
Without this the same object file need to be build with different
flags which cause a rebuild at every run.
