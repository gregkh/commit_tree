staging/wilc1000: use NO_SECURITY instead of NO_ENCRYPT

The linux_wlan.c file uses a set of enums from wilc_wlan_if.h,
with the exception of the NO_ENCRYPT that comes from
wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.h. The two sets of enums clearly have
the same intention but are defined a bit different.

To prepare to clean up the ones in wilc_wfi_cfgoperations.h, this
first changes over the only other user.
