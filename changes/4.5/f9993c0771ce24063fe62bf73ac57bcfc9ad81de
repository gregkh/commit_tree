iio: ina2xx: provide a sysfs parameter to allow async readout of the ADCs

This can lead to repeated or skipped samples depending on the clock beat
between the capture thread and the chip sampling clock, but will also spare
reading/waiting for the Capture Ready Flag and improve the available i2c
bandwidth for reading measurements.
