gpio: change member .dev to .parent

The name .dev in a struct is normally reserved for a struct device
that is let us say a superclass to the thing described by the struct.
struct gpio_chip stands out by confusingly using a struct device *dev
to point to the parent device (such as a platform_device) that
represents the hardware. As we want to give gpio_chip:s real devices,
this is not working. We need to rename this member to parent.

This was done by two coccinelle scripts, I guess it is possible to
combine them into one, but I don't know such stuff. They look like
this:

@@
struct gpio_chip *var;
@@
-var->dev
+var->parent

and:

@@
struct gpio_chip var;
@@
-var.dev
+var.parent

and:

@@
struct bgpio_chip *var;
@@
-var->gc.dev
+var->gc.parent

Plus a few instances of bgpio that I couldn't figure out how
to teach Coccinelle to rewrite.

This patch hits all over the place, but I *strongly* prefer this
solution to any piecemal approaches that just exercise patch
mechanics all over the place. It mainly hits drivers/gpio and
drivers/pinctrl which is my own backyard anyway.
