virtio_ring: use virt_store_mb

We need a full barrier after writing out event index, using
virt_store_mb there seems better than open-coding.  As usual, we need a
wrapper to account for strong barriers.

It's tempting to use this in vhost as well, for that, we'll
need a variant of smp_store_mb that works on __user pointers.
