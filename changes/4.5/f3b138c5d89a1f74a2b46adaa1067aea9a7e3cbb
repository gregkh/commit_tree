kvm/x86: Update SynIC timers on guest entry only

Consolidate updating the Hyper-V SynIC timers in a
single place: on guest entry in processing KVM_REQ_HV_STIMER
request.  This simplifies the overall logic, and makes sure
the most current state of msrs and guest clock is used for
arming the timers (to achieve that, KVM_REQ_HV_STIMER
has to be processed after KVM_REQ_CLOCK_UPDATE).
