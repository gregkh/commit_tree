arm: introduce CONFIG_PARAVIRT, PARAVIRT_TIME_ACCOUNTING and pv_time_ops

Introduce CONFIG_PARAVIRT and PARAVIRT_TIME_ACCOUNTING on ARM.

The only paravirt interface supported is pv_time_ops.steal_clock, so no
runtime pvops patching needed.

This allows us to make use of steal_account_process_tick for stolen
ticks accounting.
