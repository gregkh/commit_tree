batman-adv: Fix list removal of batadv_hardif_neigh_node

The neigh_list with batadv_hardif_neigh_node objects is accessed with only
rcu_read_lock in batadv_hardif_neigh_get and batadv_iv_neigh_print. Thus it
is not allowed to kfree the object before the rcu grace period ends (which
may still protects context accessing this object). Therefore the object has
first to be removed from the neigh_list and then it has either wait with
synchronize_rcu or call_rcu till the grace period ends before it can be
freed.
