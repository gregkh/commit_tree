i40e: clean whole mac filter list

Clean the whole mac filter list when resetting after an intermediate
add or delete push to the firmware.  The code had evolved from using
a list from the stack to a heap allocation, but the memset() didn't
follow the change correctly.  This now cleans the whole list rather
that just part of the first element.
