net: macb: clear interrupts when disabling them

Disabling interrupts with the IDR register does not stop the macb hardware
from asserting its interrupt line if there are interrupts pending.  Always
clear the interrupts using ISR, and be sure to write it on hardware that
is not read-to-clear, like Zynq.  Not doing so will cause interrupts when
the driver doesn't expect them.
