ARM: 8494/1: mm: Enable PXN when running non-LPAE kernel on LPAE processor

The VMSA field of MMFR0 (bottom 4 bits) is incremented for each
added feature.  PXN is supported if the value is >= 4 and LPAE
is supported if it is >= 5.

In case a kernel with CONFIG_ARM_LPAE disabled is used on a
processor that supports LPAE, we can still use PXN in short
descriptors.  So check for >= 4 not == 4.
