xen/events: use virt_xxx barriers

drivers/xen/events/events_fifo.c uses rmb() to communicate with the
other side.

For guests compiled with CONFIG_SMP, smp_rmb would be sufficient, so
rmb() here is only needed if a non-SMP guest runs on an SMP host.

Switch to the virt_rmb barrier which serves this exact purpose.

Pull in asm/barrier.h here to make sure the file is self-contained.
