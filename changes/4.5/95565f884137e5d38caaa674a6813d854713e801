ACPI / video: Revert "thinkpad_acpi: Use acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses()"

acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses()'s may return false if the i915
driver is not loaded yet when thinkpad_acpi loads, and then return true
after the i915 driver has loaded. This means that thinkpad_acpi cannot
use it as is since thinkpad_acpi caches the return value.

This reverts commit 7714687a2b2d ("thinkpad_acpi: Use
acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses()").
