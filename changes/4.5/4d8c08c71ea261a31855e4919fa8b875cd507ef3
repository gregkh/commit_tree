ncr5380: Move NCR53C400-specific code

Move board-specific code like this,
	NCR5380_write(C400_CONTROL_STATUS_REG, CSR_BASE);
from the core driver to the board driver. Eliminate the NCR53C400 macro
from the core driver. Removal of all macros like this one will be
necessary in order to have one core driver that can support all kinds of
boards.
