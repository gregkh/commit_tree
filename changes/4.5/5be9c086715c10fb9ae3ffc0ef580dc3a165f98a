tipc: narrow down exposure of struct tipc_node

In our effort to have less code and include dependencies between
entities such as node, link and bearer, we try to narrow down
the exposed interface towards the node as much as possible.

In this commit, we move the definition of struct tipc_node, along
with many of its associated function declarations, from node.h to
node.c. We also move some function definitions from link.c and
name_distr.c to node.c, since they access fields in struct tipc_node
that should not be externally visible. The moved functions are renamed
according to new location, and made static whenever possible.

There are no functional changes in this commit.
