kvm/x86: Hyper-V SynIC timers

Per Hyper-V specification (and as required by Hyper-V-aware guests),
SynIC provides 4 per-vCPU timers.  Each timer is programmed via a pair
of MSRs, and signals expiration by delivering a special format message
to the configured SynIC message slot and triggering the corresponding
synthetic interrupt.

Note: as implemented by this patch, all periodic timers are "lazy"
(i.e. if the vCPU wasn't scheduled for more than the timer period the
timer events are lost), regardless of the corresponding configuration
MSR.  If deemed necessary, the "catch up" mode (the timer period is
shortened until the timer catches up) will be implemented later.

Changes v2:
* Use remainder to calculate periodic timer expiration time
