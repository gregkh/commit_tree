drm: Reorganize helper vtables and their docs

Currently we have 4 helper libraries (probe, crtc, plane & atomic)
that all use the same helper vtables. And that's by necessity since we
don't want to litter the core structs with one ops pointer per helper
library. Also often the reuse the same hooks (like atomic does, to
facilite conversion from existing drivers using crtc and plane
helpers).

Given all that it doesn't make sense to put the docs for these next to
specific helpers. Instead extract them into a new header file and
section in the docbook, and add references to them everywhere.

Unfortunately kernel-doc complains when an include directive doesn't
find anything (and it does by dumping crap into the output file). We
have to remove the now empty includes to avoid that, instead of leaving
them in for future proofing.

v2: More OCD in ordering functions.

v3: Spelling plus collate copyright headers properly.
