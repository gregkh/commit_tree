usb: of: add an api to get dr_mode by the phy node

Some USB phy drivers have different handling for the controller in each
dr_mode. But the phy driver does not have visibility to the dr_mode of
the controller.

This adds an api to return the dr_mode of the controller which
associates the given phy node.
