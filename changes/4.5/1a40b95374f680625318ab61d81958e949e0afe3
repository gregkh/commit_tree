sparc: Fix system call tracing register handling.

A system call trace trigger on entry allows the tracing
process to inspect and potentially change the traced
process's registers.

Account for that by reloading the %g1 (syscall number)
and %i0-%i5 (syscall argument) values.  We need to be
careful to revalidate the range of %g1, and reload the
system call table entry it corresponds to into %l7.
