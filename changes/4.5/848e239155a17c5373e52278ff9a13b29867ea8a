drivers/base/cpu.c: use __cpu_*_mask directly

The only user of the lvalue-ness of the cpu_*_mask variables is in
drivers/base/cpu.c, and that is mostly a work-around for the fact that not
even const variables can be used in static initialization.  Now that the
underlying struct cpumasks are exposed we can take their address.
