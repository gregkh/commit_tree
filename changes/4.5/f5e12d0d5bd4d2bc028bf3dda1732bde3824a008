dt-bindings: move I2C eeprom descriptions to the proper file

EEPROMs can have additional properties, so they are not suitable for
trivial-devices.txt. Move most bindings to the designated eeprom.txt.
Add the missing "atmel,24c08" while doing that. Note that the remaining
ones in trivial-devices need to be dealt with separately because of
improper manufacturer names.
