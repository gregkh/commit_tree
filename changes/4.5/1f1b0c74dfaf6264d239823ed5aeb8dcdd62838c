ncr5380: Proceed with next command after NCR5380_select() calls scsi_done

If a target disappears from the SCSI bus, NCR5380_select() may
subsequently fail with a time-out. In this situation, scsi_done is
called and NCR5380_select() returns 0. Both hostdata->connected and
hostdata->selecting are NULL and the main loop should proceed with
the next command in the issue queue. Clarify this logic.
