ASoC: fsl_ssi: remove explicit register defaults

There is no guarantee that on fsl_ssi module load
SSI registers will have their power-on-reset values.

In fact, if the driver is reloaded the values in
registers will be whatever they were set to previously.

However, the cache needs to be fully populated at probe
time to avoid non-atomic allocations during register
access.

Special case here is imx21-class SSI, since
according to datasheet it don't have SACC{ST,EN,DIS}
regs.

This fixes hard lockup on fsl_ssi module reload,
at least in AC'97 mode.
