drbd: fix queue limit setup for discard

We cannot possibly support SECDISCARD, even if all backend devices would
support it: if our peer is currently unreachable, some instance of the
data may obviously still be recoverable.

We did not set discard_granularity at all.  We don't really care (yet),
we only pass them on, so for now, set our granularity to one sector.
blkdev_stack_limits() takes care of the rest.

If we decide we cannot support discards,
not only clear the (not user visible) QUEUE_FLAG_DISCARD,
but set both (user visible) discard_granularity and max_discard_sectors
to zero, to avoid confusion with e.g. lsblk -D.
