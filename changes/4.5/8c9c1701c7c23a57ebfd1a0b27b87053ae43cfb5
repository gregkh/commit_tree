mm/memblock: introduce for_each_memblock_type()

We already have the for_each_memblock() macro in <linux/memblock.h>
which provides ability to iterate over memblock regions of a known type.
The for_each_memblock() macro allows us to pass the pointer to the
struct memblock_type, instead we need to pass name of the type.

This patch introduces a new macro for_each_memblock_type() which allows
us iterate over memblock regions with the given type when the type is
unknown.
