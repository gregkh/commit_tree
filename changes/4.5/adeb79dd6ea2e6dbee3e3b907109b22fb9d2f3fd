ACPICA: Tools: Add spacing and missing options in acpibin tool

ACPICA commit e7c8ffbbef3f7ce340e012ae4db63ea16cd09714

The -e option is missing from the acpibin help options, so add
this.  Also, there should be spaces between the filenames for the
-c and -d optios, so add this and expand the field size from 18
to 20 characters in the ACPI_OPTION macro.
