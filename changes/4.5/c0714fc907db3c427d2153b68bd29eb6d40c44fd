drm: Document drm_atomic_*_get_property

Yes these are internal functions and not exported and we generally
don't document them. But for symmetry with the _set_property functions
(which are exported for the atomic helpers) I'd like to document them.
Upcoming vtable kerneldoc will reference both the set and get_property
functions.

v2: Suggestions from Thierry.
