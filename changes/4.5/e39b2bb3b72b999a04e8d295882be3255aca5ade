libata: skip debounce delay on link resume

The link resume logic uses a 200msec delay while debouncing
the SControl register. The rationale behind that delay is
to accommodate some PHYs that behave badly if their SStatus/
SControl registers are pounded immediately on resume.
The Broadcom STB SATA PHY does not seem to have this issue.
This patch introduces a new link flag that allows platforms
to skip the debounce delay if it isn't needed.
