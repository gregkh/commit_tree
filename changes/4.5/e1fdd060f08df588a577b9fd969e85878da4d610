ARM: dts: am57xx: sbc-am57x: add basic board support

SBC-AM57x is a single board computer designed for industrial and
embedded applications. It is based on the Texas Instruments Sitara AM57x
system-on-chip family. SBC-AM57x is implemented with the CL-SOM-AM57x
computer-on-module providing most of the functions, and SB-SOM-AM57x
carrier board providing additional peripheral functions and connectors.
