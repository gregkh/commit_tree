NFS: Use wait_on_atomic_t() for unlock after readahead

The use of wait_on_atomic_t() for waiting on I/O to complete before
unlocking allows us to git rid of the NFS_IO_INPROGRESS flag, and thus the
nfs_iocounter's flags member, and finally the nfs_iocounter altogether.
The count of I/O is moved to the lock context, and the counter
increment/decrement functions become simple enough to open-code.
