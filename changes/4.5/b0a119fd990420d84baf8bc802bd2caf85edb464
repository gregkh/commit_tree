Revert "MIPS: bcm63xx: nvram: Remove unused bcm63xx_nvram_get_psi_size() function"

This reverts commit 5bdb102b3f9785cb88467bc7c75fa0f5cacc8dc5.

Brian Norris <computersforpeace@gmail.com> is reporting:

Ralf,

Please revert this and send it to Linus (or else, I can send it myself).
This is causing build failures, because I didn't take the rest of
Simon's series yet.

drivers/mtd/bcm63xxpart.c: In function 'bcm63xx_parse_cfe_partitions':
drivers/mtd/bcm63xxpart.c:93:2: error: implicit declaration of function
'bcm63xx_nvram_get_psi_size' [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
