dm: don't save and restore bi_private

Device mapper used the field bi_private to point to dm_target_io. However,
since kernel 3.15, the bi_private field is unused, and so the targets do
not need to save and restore this field.

This patch removes code that saves and restores bi_private from dm-cache,
dm-snapshot and dm-verity.
