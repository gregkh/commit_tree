gpiolib: improve overlap check of range of gpio

There are limitations for the current checker:
1.  Could not check the overlap if the new gpiochip is the secondly
    gpiochip.
2.  Could not check the overlap if the new gpiochip is overlap
    with the left of gpiochip. E.g. if we insert [c, d] between
    [a,b] and [e, f], and e >= c + d, it will successful even if
    c < a + b.
3.  Allow overlap of base of different gpiochip.

This patch fix these issues by checking the overlap of both right and
left gpiochip in the same loop statement.
