tg3: Fix for tg3 transmit queue 0 timed out when too many gso_segs

tg3_tso_bug() can hit a condition where the entire tx ring is not big
enough to segment the GSO packet. For example, if MSS is very small,
gso_segs can exceed the tx ring size. When we hit the condition, it
will cause tx timeout.

tg3_tso_bug() is called to handle TSO and DMA hardware bugs.
For TSO bugs, if tg3_tso_bug() cannot succeed, we have to drop the packet.
For DMA bugs, we can still fall back to linearize the SKB and let the
hardware transmit the TSO packet.

This patch adds a function tg3_tso_bug_gso_check() to check if there
are enough tx descriptors for GSO before calling tg3_tso_bug().
The caller will then handle the error appropriately - drop or
lineraize the SKB.

v2: Corrected patch description to avoid confusion.
