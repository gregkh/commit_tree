ASoC: fsl_asrc: add support for 8-30kHz output sample rate

Add 8kHz, 11.025kHz, 16kHz, 22.05kHz output sample rate support.

According referance menual, "Limited support for the case when
output sampling rates is between 8kHz and 30kHz. The limitation
is the supported ratio (Fsin/Fsout) range as between 1/24 to 8."
