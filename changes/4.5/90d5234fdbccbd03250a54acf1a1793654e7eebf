drm/i915: fix the CFB size check

In function find_compression_threshold() we try to over-allocate CFB
space in order to reduce reallocations and fragmentation, and we're
not considering that at the CFB size check. Consider it.

There is also a longer-term plan to kill
dev_priv->fbc.uncompressed_size, but this will come later.

v2: Use drm_mm_node_allocated() (Chris).
