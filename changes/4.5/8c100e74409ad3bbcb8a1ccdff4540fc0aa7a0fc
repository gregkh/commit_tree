usb: chipidea: otg: use usb autosuspend to suspend bus for HNP

Directly manipulate the controller regsiter to suspend the usb bus
for HNP is not the proper way, this should be done through the usbcore
by usb autosuspend. So to start HNP, autosuspend support should be
added for OTG devices interface driver if it's not enabled.
