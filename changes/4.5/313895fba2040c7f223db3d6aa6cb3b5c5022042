[media] media-entity: remove unneded enclosing parenthesis

Commit 86ee417578a2 ("[media] media: convert links from array to list")
had many changes that were automated using coccinelle but the semantic
patch was not smart enough to rely on operators precedence and avoid
using unnecessary enclosing parenthesis.

This patch removes them since are not needed.
