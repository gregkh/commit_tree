leds: core: Use set_brightness_work for the blocking op

This patch makes LED core capable of setting brightness for drivers
that implement brightness_set_blocking op. It removes from LED class
drivers responsibility for using work queues on their own.

In order to achieve this set_brightness_delayed callback is being
modified to directly call one of available ops for brightness setting.

led_set_brightness_async() function didn't set brightness in an
asynchronous way in all cases. It was mistakenly assuming that all
LED subsystem drivers used work queue in their brightness_set op,
whereas only half of them did that. Since it has no users now,
it is being removed.
