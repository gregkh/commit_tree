clk: bcm2835: Support for clock parent selection

Some bcm2835 clocks used by hardware (like "PWM" or "H264") can have multiple
parent clocks. These clocks divide the rate of a parent which can be selected by
setting the proper bits in the clock control register.

Previously all these parents where handled by a mux clock. But a mux clock
cannot be used because updating clock control register to select parent needs a
password to be xor'd with the parent index.

This patch get rid of mux clock and make these clocks handle their own parent,
allowing them to select the one to use.
