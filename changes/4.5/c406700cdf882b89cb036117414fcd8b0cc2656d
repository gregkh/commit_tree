ethernet/atheros/alx: sanitize buffer sizing and padding

This is based on the work done by Przemek Rudy in bug 70761 at
bugzilla.kernel.org, but with some work done to disentagle and clarify
things a bit.

Similar to Przemek's work and other drivers, we're adding a padding of 16
here, but we're also disentangling mtu size calculations from max buffer
size calculations a bit, and adding ETH_HLEN to the value written into
ALX_MTU. Hopefully, with a bit more consistency and clarity, things behave
better here. Sadly, I can only test in my alx-driven E2200, which worked
just fine before this patch.

In comment #58 of bug 70761, Eugene A. Shatokhin reports that this patch
does help considerably for a ROSA Linux user of his with an AR8162 network
adapter when patched into a 4.1.x-based kernel, with several days of
normal operation where wired network previously wasn't usable without
setting MTU to 9000 as a work-around.
