cpufreq: qoriq: allow building as module with THERMAL=m

My previous patch to avoid link errors with the qoriq cpufreq
driver disallowed all of the broken cases, but also prevented
the driver from being built when CONFIG_THERMAL is a module.

This changes the dependency to allow the cpufreq driver to
also be a module in this case, just not built-in.
