nvme: do not restart the request timeout if we're resetting the controller

Otherwise we're never going to complete a command when it is restarted just
after we completed all other outstanding commands in nvme_clear_queue.

The controller must be disabled prior to completing a presumed lost
command, do this by directly shutting down the controller before
queueing the reset work, and return EH_HANDLED from the timeout handler
after we shut the controller down.
