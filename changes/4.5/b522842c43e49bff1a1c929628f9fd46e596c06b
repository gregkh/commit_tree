ARM: 8448/1: add some L220 DT settings

The RealView ARM11MPCore enables parity, eventmon and shared
override in the cache controller through its current boardfile,
but the code and DT bindings for the ARM L220 is currently
lacking the ability to set this up from DT. Add the required
bool parameters for parity and shared override, but keep
eventmon out of it: this should be enabled by the event
monitor code.
