arm64: dts: Enable HS200 mode operation on exynos7-espresso

This patch enables HS200 mode operation on Exynos7 based
Espresso board.
This also removes _broken-cd_ property as per mmc binding documentation
which says one of the properties between broken-cd and non-removable
should be used. And we already use _non-removable_ as emmc is mounted
on the board which is a non-removable device.
