drm/exynos: exynos5433_decon: fix wrong state assignment in decon_enable

Patch ebf3fd403b79ba6561bd1a4bb5a7cacc99da08e5 ("drm/exynos: add
pm_runtime to DECON 5433") removed some code from decon_enable()
function, but it left set_bit(BIT_SUSPENDED, &ctx->flags) call, which
was earlier called only in error path. This patch removes it, what
finally lets driver to go out of suspended state.
