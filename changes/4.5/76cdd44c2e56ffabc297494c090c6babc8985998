s390/facilities: always use lowcore's stfle field for storing facility bits

head.s contains an stfle instruction which stores it result at the
storage location that is assigned to the stfl instruction.

This is currently no problem, since we only care about one double
word. However if the number of double words in the ALS bitfield grows
the current code is not very stable.

E.g. before issuing the stfle command the memory to which it stores
must be cleared, since the instruction may or may not clear memory
contents where no bits are set.

In order to simplify the code a bit always use the storage location
that we reserved for the stfle result.
