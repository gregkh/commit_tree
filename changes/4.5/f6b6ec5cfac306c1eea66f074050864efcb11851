raid5-cache: add journal hot add/remove support

Add support for journal disk hot add/remove. Mostly trival checks in md
part. The raid5 part is a little tricky. For hot-remove, we can't wait
pending write as it's called from raid5d. The wait will cause deadlock.
We simplily fail the hot-remove. A hot-remove retry can success
eventually since if journal disk is faulty all pending write will be
failed and finish. For hot-add, since an array supporting journal but
without journal disk will be marked read-only, we are safe to hot add
journal without stopping IO (should be read IO, while journal only
handles write IO).
