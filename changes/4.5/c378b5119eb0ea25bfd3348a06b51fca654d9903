Input: psmouse - factor out common protocol probing code

In preparation of limiting protocols that we try on pass-through ports,
let's rework initialization code and factor common code into
psmouse_try_protocol() that accepts protocol type (instead of detec()
function pointer) and can, for most protocols, perform both detection and
initialization.

Note that this removes option of forcing Lifebook protocol on devices that
are not recognized by lifebook_detect() as having the hardware, but I do
not recall anyone using this option.
