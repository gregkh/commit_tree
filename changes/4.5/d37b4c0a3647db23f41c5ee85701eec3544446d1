be2net: remove local variable 'status'

The lancer_cmd_get_file_len() uses lancer_cmd_read_object() to get
the current size of registers for ethtool registers dump. Returned status
value is stored but not checked. The check itself is not necessary as
the data_read output variable is initialized to 0 and status variable
can be removed.
