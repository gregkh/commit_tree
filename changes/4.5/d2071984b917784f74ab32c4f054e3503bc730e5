staging: rtl8192u: Remove unnecessary function

This patch solves two problems.
The function rtl8192_CalculateBitShift() had an unnecessary variable i
that could be removed by using a single line of code.

After this change, rtl8192_CalculateBitShift() becomes a wrapper
function, so the rtl8192_CalculateBitShift() function has been removed
completely to replace it with a single line of code.
