dmaengine: sh: Remove unused R-Car HPB-DMAC driver

As of commit 4baadb9e05c68962 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7778: remove obsolete
setup code"), the Renesas R-Car HPB-DMAC driver is no longer used.
In theory it could still be used on R-Car Gen1 SoCs, but that requires
adding DT support to the driver, which is not planned.

Remove the driver, it can be resurrected from git history when needed.
