dmaengine: edma: fix residue race for cyclic

When retrieving the residue value, the SRC/DST fields of the
active PaRAM are read to determine the current position of
the DMA engine. However, the AM335x Technical Reference Manual
states:

  11.3.3.6 Parameter Set Updates

  After the TR is read from the PaRAM (and is in the process
  of being submitted to the EDMA3TC), the following fields are
  updated as needed: ... SRC DST

This means SRC/DST is incremented even though the DMA transfer
may not have started yet or is in progress. Thus if the reader
of the residue accesses the DMA buffer too quickly, the CPU is
misinformed about the data that has been successfully processed.

The CCSTAT.ACTV register is a boolean that is set if any TR is
being processed by either the EMDA3CC or EDMA3TC. By polling
this register it is possible to ensure that the residue value
returned is valid for immediate processing. However, since the
DMA engine may be active, polling may never hit a moment where
no TR is being processed. To handle this, the SRC/DST is also
polled to see if it changes. And as a last resort, a max loop
count for the busy waiting exists to avoid an infinite loop.
