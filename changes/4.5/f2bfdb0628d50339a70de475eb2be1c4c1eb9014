serial: 8250_early: confirm empty transmitter after sending characters

The current code waits until the transmitter becomes empty,
before sending each character, and after finishing the whole string.
This seems a bit redundant.

It can be more efficient by checking the transmitter only after sending
each character.  This should be safe because the transmitter is already
empty at the first entry of serial_putc().
