ACPICA: Namespace: Add String -> ObjectReference conversion support

ACPICA commit 80e60d72959bb51c5d08c8500d978607a42ed81d

BIOS developers may accidently put the quotes around the name strings,
which converts the object references in the packages indicated by the name
strings into the data objects (strings). Such kind of error has been seen
in _DEP control methods on some platforms. This patch implements a
workaround to correct it. Reported by Bastien Nocera. Fixed by Lv Zheng.
