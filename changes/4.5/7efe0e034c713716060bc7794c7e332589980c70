perf record: Support custom vmlinux path

Make perf-record command support --vmlinux option if BPF_PROLOGUE is on.

'perf record' needs vmlinux as the source of DWARF info to generate
prologue for BPF programs, so path of vmlinux should be specified.

Short name 'k' has been taken by 'clockid'. This patch skips the short
option name and uses '--vmlinux' for vmlinux path.

Documentation is also updated.

Test result:

In a production (or broken) environment:
 (by:
  # rm -rf ~/.debug/
  # mv /lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/vmlinux /tmp/
 )

 # ./perf record -e ./test_bpf_base.c ls
 Failed to find the path for kernel: No such file or directory
 event syntax error: './test_bpf_base.c'
                      \___ You need to check probing points in BPF file
 ...

 # ./perf record --vmlinux /tmp/vmlinux -e ./test_bpf_base.c ls
