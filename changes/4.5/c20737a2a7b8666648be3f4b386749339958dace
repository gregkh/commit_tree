clk: imx5: ipu_di_sel clocks can set parent rates

To obtain exact pixel clocks, allow the DI clock selectors to influence
the PLLs that they are derived from.

Commit 4591b13289b5 ("ARM: i.MX6: ipu_di_sel clocks can set parent
rates") did this for i.MX6.
Port it to enable high display resolutions on i.MX53 based platforms
such as CX9020 Embedded PC, too.
