IB/mlx5: Add CREATE_CQ and CREATE_QP to uverbs_ex_cmd_mask

The mlx5_ib driver supports the extended create_cq and create_qp user
verbs. In the current mechanism, a vendor supporting an extended uverb
should set the appropriate bit in the uverbs_ex_cmd_mask field.
Adding the actual support by setting the required bits in order to
support features like completion time-stamping and cross-channel.

Fixes: ddf9529be19c ('IB/core: Allow setting create flags in QP init
                      attribute')
