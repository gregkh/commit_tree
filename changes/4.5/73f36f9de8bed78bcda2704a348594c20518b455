rcu: Make expedited grace periods resolve stall-warning ties

Currently, if a grace period ends just as the stall-warning timeout
fires, an empty stall warning will be printed.  This is not helpful,
so this commit avoids these useless warnings by rechecking completion
after awakening in synchronize_sched_expedited_wait().
