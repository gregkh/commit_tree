mm/hugetlb: fix gigantic page initialization/allocation

Attempting to preallocate 1G gigantic huge pages at boot time with
"hugepagesz=1G hugepages=1" on the kernel command line will prevent
booting with the following:

  kernel BUG at mm/hugetlb.c:1218!

When mapcount accounting was reworked, the setting of
compound_mapcount_ptr in prep_compound_gigantic_page was overlooked.  As
a result, the validation of mapcount in free_huge_page fails.

The "BUG_ON" checks in free_huge_page were also changed to
"VM_BUG_ON_PAGE" to assist with debugging.
