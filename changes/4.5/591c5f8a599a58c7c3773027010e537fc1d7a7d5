staging: comedi: avoid bad truncation of a size_t in comedi_write()

At one point in `comedi_write()`, the variable `n` gets assigned to the
minimum of the parameter `nbytes` and the amount of writeable buffer
space.  The way that is done currently is unsafe in the unlikely case
that `nbytes` exceeds `UINT_MAX`, so fix it.
