Documentation: Explain pci=conf1,conf2 more verbosely

People complained that setting the PCI config space access mechanism
through "pci=conf1" or "pci=conf2" on the command line is not really
documented. Yeah, can you blame them? Look at what we have now.

So try to improve the situation a bit by explaining what those "conf1"
and "conf2" things actually mean.

See http://wiki.osdev.org/PCI for more info.
