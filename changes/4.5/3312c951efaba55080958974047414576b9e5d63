md: avoid warning for 32-bit sector_t

When CONFIG_LBDAF is not set, sector_t is only 32-bits wide, which
means we cannot have devices with more than 2TB, and the code that
is trying to handle compatibility support for large devices in
md version 0.90 is meaningless but also causes a compile-time warning:

drivers/md/md.c: In function 'super_90_load':
drivers/md/md.c:1029:19: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Woverflow]
drivers/md/md.c: In function 'super_90_rdev_size_change':
drivers/md/md.c:1323:17: warning: large integer implicitly truncated to unsigned type [-Woverflow]

This adds a check for CONFIG_LBDAF to avoid even getting into this
code path, and also adds an explicit cast to let the compiler know
it doesn't have to warn about the truncation.
