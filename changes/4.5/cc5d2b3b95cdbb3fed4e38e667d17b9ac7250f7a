arm64: mm: detect bad __create_mapping uses

If a caller of __create_mapping provides a PA and VA which have
different sub-page offsets, it is not clear which offset they expect to
apply to the mapping, and is indicative of a bad caller.

In some cases, the region we wish to map may validly have a sub-page
offset in the physical and virtual addresses. For example, EFI runtime
regions have 4K granularity, yet may be mapped by a 64K page kernel. So
long as the physical and virtual offsets are the same, the region will
be mapped at the expected VAs.

Disallow calls with differing sub-page offsets, and WARN when they are
encountered, so that we can detect and fix such cases.
