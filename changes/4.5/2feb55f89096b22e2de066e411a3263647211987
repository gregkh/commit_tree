fs: allow no_seek_end_llseek to actually seek

The user-visible impact of the issue is for example that without this
patch sensors-detect breaks when trying to seek in /dev/cpu/0/cpuid.

'~0ULL' is a 'unsigned long long' that when converted to a loff_t,
which is signed, gets turned into -1. later in vfs_setpos we have
'if (offset > maxsize)', which makes it always return EINVAL.
