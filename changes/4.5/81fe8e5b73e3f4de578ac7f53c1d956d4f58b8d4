leds: core: Add led_set_brightness_nosleep{nopm} functions

This patch adds led_set_brightness_nosleep() and led_set_brightness_nopm()
functions, that guarantee setting LED brightness in a non-blocking way.
The latter is used from pm_ops context and doesn't modify the brightness
cached in the struct led_classdev. Its execution always ends up with
a call to brightness setting op - either directly or through
a set_brightness_work, regardless of LED_SUSPENDED flag state.

The patch also replaces led_set_brightness_async() with
led_set_brightness_nosleep() in all places where the most vital was setting
brightness in a non sleeping way but not necessarily asynchronously, which
is not needed for non-blocking drivers.
