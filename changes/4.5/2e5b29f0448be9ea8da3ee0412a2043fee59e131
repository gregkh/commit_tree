pNFS/flexfiles: Don't prevent flexfiles client from retrying LAYOUTGET

Fix a bug in which flexfiles clients are falling back to I/O through the
MDS even when the FF_FLAGS_NO_IO_THRU_MDS flag is set.

The flexfiles client will always report errors through the LAYOUTRETURN
and/or LAYOUTERROR mechanisms, so it should normally be safe for it
to retry the LAYOUTGET until it fails or succeeds.
