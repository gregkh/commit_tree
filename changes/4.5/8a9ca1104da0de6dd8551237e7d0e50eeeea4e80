ixgbevf: Limit lowest interrupt rate for adaptive interrupt moderation to 12K

This patch is the ixgbevf version of commit 8ac34f10a5ea4 "ixgbe: Limit
lowest interrupt rate for adaptive interrupt moderation to 12K"

The same logic applies here as well as the same results since a netperf
test will starve for memory in the time from one Tx interrupt to the next.
As a result the ixgbevf driver underperformed when compared to vhost_net.
