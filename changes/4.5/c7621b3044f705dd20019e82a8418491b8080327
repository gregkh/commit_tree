[media] v4l: vsp1: separate links creation from entities init

The vsp1 driver initializes the entities and creates the pads links
before the entities are registered with the media device. This doesn't
work now that object IDs are used to create links so the media_device
has to be set.

Split out the pads links creation from the entity initialization so are
made after the entities registration.
