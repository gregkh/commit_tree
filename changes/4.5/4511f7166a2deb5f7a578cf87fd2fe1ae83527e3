Thermal: do thermal zone update after a cooling device registered

When a new cooling device is registered, we need to update the
thermal zone to set the new registered cooling device to a proper
state.

This fixes a problem that the system is cool, while the fan devices
are left running on full speed after boot, if fan device is registered
after thermal zone device.
