ALSA: hda - Use component ops for i915 HDMI/DP audio jack handling

Since we have a new audio component ops to fetch the current ELD and
state now, we can reduce the usage of unsol event of HDMI/DP pins.
The unsol event isn't only unreliable, but it also needs the power
up/down of the codec and link at each time, which is a significant
power and time loss.

In this patch, the jack creation and unsol/jack event handling are
modified to use the audio component for the dedicated Intel chips.

The jack handling got slightly more codes than a simple usage of
hda_jack layer since we need to deal directly with snd_jack object;
the hda_jack layer is basically designed for the pin sense read and
unsol events, both of which aren't used any longer in our case.
