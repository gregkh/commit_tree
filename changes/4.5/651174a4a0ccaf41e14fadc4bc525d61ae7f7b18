drm/i915/ddi: fix intel_display_port_aux_power_domain() after HDMI detect

Due to the current sharing of the DDI encoder between DP and HDMI
connectors we can run the DP detection after the HDMI detection has
already set the shared encoder's type. For now solve this keeping the
current behavior and running the detection in this case too. For a proper
solution Ville suggested to split the encoder into an HDMI and DP one, that
can be done as a follow-up.

This issue triggers the WARN in intel_display_port_aux_power_domain() and
was introduced in:
