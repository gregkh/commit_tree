mm: avoid uninitialized variable in tracepoint

A newly added tracepoint in the hugepage code uses a variable in the
error handling that is not initialized at that point:

include/trace/events/huge_memory.h:81:230: error: 'isolated' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

The result is relatively harmless, as the trace data will in rare
cases contain incorrect data.

This works around the problem by adding an explicit initialization.
