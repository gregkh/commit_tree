include/linux/hugetlb.h: is_file_hugepages() can be boolean

Make is_file_hugepages() return bool to improve readability due to this
particular function only using either one or zero as its return value.

This patch also removed the if condition to make is_file_hugepages
return directly.

No functional change.
