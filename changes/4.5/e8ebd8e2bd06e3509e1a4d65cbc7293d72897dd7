drm/i915: eliminate 'temp' in gen8_for_each_{pdd, pdpe, pml4e} macros

All of these iterator macros require a 'temp' argument, used merely to
hold internal partial results. We can instead declare the temporary
variable inside the macro, so the caller need not provide it.

Some of the old code contained nested iterators that actually reused the
same 'temp' variable for both inner and outer instances. It's quite
surprising that this didn't introduce bugs! But it does show that the
value of 'temp' isn't required to persist during the iterated body.
