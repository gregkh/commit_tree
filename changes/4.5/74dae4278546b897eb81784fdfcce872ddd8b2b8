ext4: fix crashes in dioread_nolock mode

Competing overwrite DIO in dioread_nolock mode will just overwrite
pointer to io_end in the inode. This may result in data corruption or
extent conversion happening from IO completion interrupt because we
don't properly set buffer_defer_completion() when unlocked DIO races
with locked DIO to unwritten extent.

Since unlocked DIO doesn't need io_end for anything, just avoid
allocating it and corrupting pointer from inode for locked DIO.
A cleaner fix would be to avoid these games with io_end pointer from the
inode but that requires more intrusive changes so we leave that for
later.
