checkpatch: improve macros with flow control test

The current test excludes any macro with ## concatenation from being
reported with hidden flow control.

Some macros are used with return or goto statements along with ##args or
##__VA_ARGS__.  A somewhat common case is a logging macro like
pr_info(fmt, ...) then a return or goto statement.

Check the concatenated variable for args or __VA_ARGS__ and allow those
macros to also be reported when they contain a return or goto.
