Staging: speakup: fix read scrolled-back VT

Previously, speakup would always read the non-scrolled part of the VT,
even when the VT is scrolled back with shift-page.  This patch makes
vt.c export screen_pos so that speakup can use it to properly access
the content of the scrolled-back VT.

This was tested with both vgacon and fbcon.
