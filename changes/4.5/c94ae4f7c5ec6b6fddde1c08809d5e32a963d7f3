arm64: insn: remove BUG_ON from codegen

During code generation, we used to BUG_ON unknown/unsupported encoding
or invalid parameters.

Instead, now we report these as errors and simply return the
instruction AARCH64_BREAK_FAULT. Users of these codegen helpers should
check for and handle this failure condition as appropriate.

Otherwise, unhandled codegen failure will result in trapping at
run-time due to AARCH64_BREAK_FAULT, which is arguably better than a
BUG_ON.
