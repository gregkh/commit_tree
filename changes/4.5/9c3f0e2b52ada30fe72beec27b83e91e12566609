atari_NCR5380: Remove RESET_BOOT, CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI_TOSHIBA_DELAY and CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI_RESET_BOOT

The atari_NCR5380.c core driver now takes care of bus reset upon driver
initialization if required (same as NCR5380.c). Move the Toshiba CD-ROM
support into the core driver, enabled with a host flag, so that all
NCR5380 drivers can make use of it.

Drop the RESET_BOOT macros and the ATARI_SCSI_RESET_BOOT and
ATARI_SCSI_TOSHIBA_DELAY Kconfig symbols, which are now redundant.

Remove the atari_scsi_reset_boot(), mac_scsi_reset_boot() and
sun3_scsi_reset_boot() routines. None of this duplicated code is needed
now that all drivers can use NCR5380_maybe_reset_bus().

This brings atari_scsi, mac_scsi and sun3_scsi into line with all of the
other NCR5380 drivers.

The bus reset may raise an interrupt. That would be new behaviour for
atari_scsi only when CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI_RESET_BOOT=n. The ST DMA interrupt
is not assigned to atari_scsi at this stage, so
CONFIG_ATARI_SCSI_RESET_BOOT=y may well be problematic already.
Regardless, do_reset() now raises and clears the interrupt within
local_irq_save/restore which should avoid problems.
