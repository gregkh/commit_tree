drm/i915: intel_ring_initialized() must be simple and inline

Based on Chris Wilson's patch from 6 months ago, rebased and adapted.

The current implementation of intel_ring_initialized() is too heavyweight;
it's a non-inlined function that chases several levels of pointers. This
wouldn't matter too much if it were rarely called, but it's used inside
the iterator test of for_each_ring() and is therefore called quite
frequently. So let's make it simple and inline ...

The idea here is to use ring->dev as an indicator showing which engines
have been initialised and are therefore to be included in iterations that
use for_each_ring(). This allows us to avoid multiple memory references
and a (non-inlined) function call on each iteration of each such loop.
