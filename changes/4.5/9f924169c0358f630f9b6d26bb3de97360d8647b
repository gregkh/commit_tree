i2c: always enable RuntimePM for the adapter device

The adapter device is a logical device. Because of that, it already uses
pm_runtime_no_callbacks() in the core. To ensure proper propagation from
the children (i2c devices) to the parent of the adapter (the HW device),
make sure RuntimePM is enabled in any case.
