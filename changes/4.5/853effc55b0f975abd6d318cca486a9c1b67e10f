l2tp: Fix error creating L2TP tunnels

A previous commit (33f72e6) added notification via netlink for tunnels
when created/modified/deleted. If the notification returned an error,
this error was returned from the tunnel function. If there were no
listeners, the error code ESRCH was returned, even though having no
listeners is not an error. Other calls to this and other similar
notification functions either ignore the error code, or filter ESRCH.
This patch checks for ESRCH and does not flag this as an error.
