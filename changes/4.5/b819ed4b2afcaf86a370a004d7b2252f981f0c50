pNFS/flexfiles: Improve merging of errors in LAYOUTRETURN

When we hit 22 errors, we start to overflow the memory buffers allocated
to the LAYOUTRETURN errors. The issue is that currently, RPC call reply
ordering determines how successful we are in merging errors that refer
to contiguous READ or WRITE requests.

Fix is to use an insertion sort to help detect contiguity.
