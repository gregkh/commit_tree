net: ipmr: add mfc newroute/delroute netlink support

This patch adds support to add and remove MFC entries. It uses the
same attributes like the already present dump support in order to be
consistent. There's one new entry - RTA_PREFSRC, it's used to denote an
MFC_PROXY entry (see MRT_ADD_MFC vs MRT_ADD_MFC_PROXY).
The already existing infrastructure is used to create and delete the
entries, the netlink message gets converted internally to a struct mfcctl
which is used with ipmr_mfc_add/delete.
The other used attributes are:
RTA_IIF - used for mfcc_parent (when adding it's required to be valid)
RTA_SRC - used for mfcc_origin
RTA_DST - used for mfcc_mcastgrp
RTA_TABLE - the MRT table id
RTA_MULTIPATH - the "oifs" ttl array
