libnvdimm, pmem: move request_queue allocation earlier in probe

Before the dynamically allocated struct pages from devm_memremap_pages()
can be put to use outside the driver, we need a mechanism to track
whether they are still in use at teardown.  Towards that goal reorder
the initialization sequence to allow the 'q_usage_counter' from the
request_queue to be used by the devm_memremap_pages() implementation (in
subsequent patches).
