xfs: debug mode log record crc error injection

XFS now uses CRC verification over a limited section of the log to
detect torn writes prior to a crash. This is difficult to test directly
due to the timing and hardware requirements to cause a short write.

Add a mechanism to inject CRC errors into log records to facilitate
testing torn write detection during log recovery. This mechanism is
dangerous and can result in filesystem corruption. Thus, it is only
available in DEBUG mode for testing/development purposes. Set a non-zero
value to the following sysfs entry to enable error injection:

	/sys/fs/xfs/<dev>/log/log_badcrc_factor

Once enabled, XFS intentionally writes an invalid CRC to a log record at
some random point in the future based on the provided frequency. The
filesystem immediately shuts down once the record has been written to
the physical log to prevent metadata writeback (e.g., AIL insertion)
once the log write completes. This helps reasonably simulate a torn
write to the log as the affected record must be safe to discard. The
next mount after the intentional shutdown requires log recovery and
should detect and recover from the torn write.

Note again that this _will_ result in data loss or worse. For testing
and development purposes only!
