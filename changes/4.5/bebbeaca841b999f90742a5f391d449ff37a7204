drm/i915: PSR: Don't Skip aux handshake on DP_PSR_NO_TRAIN_ON_EXIT.

Since the beginning there is a confusion on the meaning of this bit.

A previous patch had identified this already and fixed it partially:
'commit 3301d409 ("drm/i915: PSR: Fix DP_PSR_NO_TRAIN_ON_EXIT logic")

DP_PSR_NO_TRAIN_ON_EXIT means the source doesn't need to do the
training, but it doesn't tell to avoid TP patterns or to skip
aux handshake.

This patch fixes the hard freeze reported.
