ASoC: rsnd: use mod base common method on DMA phase2

Renesas sound needs many devices
(SSI/SSIU/SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC/CMD/AudioDMAC/AudioDMACpp).
SSI/SRC/CTU/MIX/DVC are implemented as module.
SSI parent, SSIU are implemented as part of SSI
CMD is implemented as part of CTU/MIX/DVC
AudioDMAC/AudioDMACpp are implemented as part of SSI/SRC
It is nice sense that these all devices are implemented as mod.

DMA will be implemented as module. Then rsnd_dma_ops will be rebased
to rsnd_mod_ops, but these are similar, but different function.
This patch modify rsnd_dma_ops same style as rsnd_mod_ops.
This is prepare for final merge
