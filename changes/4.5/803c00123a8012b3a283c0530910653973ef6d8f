ncpfs: fix a braino in OOM handling in ncp_fill_cache()

Failing to allocate an inode for child means that cache for *parent* is
incompletely populated.  So it's parent directory inode ('dir') that
needs NCPI_DIR_CACHE flag removed, *not* the child inode ('inode', which
is what we'd failed to allocate in the first place).
