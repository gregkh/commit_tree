gpio: ssbi-mpp: Be sure to clamp return value

As we want gpio_chip .get() calls to be able to return negative
error codes and propagate to drivers, we need to go over all
drivers and make sure their return values are clamped to [0,1].
We do this by using the ret = !!(val) design pattern.

This code was also double-inverting a bool which makes no sense
so I removed that code and moved clamping toward the end.
