net: phy: bcm7xxx: Fix bcm7xxx_config_init() check

Since we were wrongly advertising gigabit features for these 10/100 only
Ethernet PHYs, bcm7xxx_config_init() which is supposed to apply workaround
would have not run since the check would be true, now that we have fixed the
PHY features, remove that check since it has no reasoning to be there anymore.
