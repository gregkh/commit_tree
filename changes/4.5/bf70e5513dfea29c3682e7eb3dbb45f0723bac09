x86/mm: Fix slow_virt_to_phys() for X86_PAE again

"d1cd12108346: x86, pageattr: Prevent overflow in slow_virt_to_phys() for
X86_PAE" was unintentionally removed by the recent "34437e67a672: x86/mm: Fix
slow_virt_to_phys() to handle large PAT bit".

And, the variable 'phys_addr' was defined as "unsigned long" by mistake -- it should
be "phys_addr_t".

As a result, Hyper-V network driver in 32-PAE Linux guest can't work again.

Fixes: commit 34437e67a672: "x86/mm: Fix slow_virt_to_phys() to handle large PAT bit"
