efi: Make our variable validation list include the guid

All the variables in this list so far are defined to be in the global
namespace in the UEFI spec, so this just further ensures we're
validating the variables we think we are.

Including the guid for entries will become more important in future
patches when we decide whether or not to allow deletion of variables
based on presence in this list.
