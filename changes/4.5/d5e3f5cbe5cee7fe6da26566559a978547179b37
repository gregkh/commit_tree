um: Prevent IRQ handler reentrancy

The existing IRQ handler design in UML does not prevent reentrancy

This is mitigated by fd-enable/fd-disable semantics for the IO
portion of the UML subsystem. The timer, however, can and is
re-entered resulting in very deep stack usage and occasional
stack exhaustion.

This patch prevents this by checking if there is a timer
interrupt in-flight before processing any pending timer interrupts.
