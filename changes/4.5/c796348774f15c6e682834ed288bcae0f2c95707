ntp: Fix second_overflow's input parameter type to be 64bits

The function "second_overflow" uses "unsign long"
as its input parameter type which will overflow after
year 2106 on 32bit systems.

Thus this patch replaces it with time64_t type.

While the 64-bit division is expensive, "next_ntp_leap_sec"
has been calculated already, so we can just re-use it in the
TIME_INS/DEL cases, allowing one expensive division per
leapsecond instead of re-doing the divsion once a second after
the leap flag has been set.
