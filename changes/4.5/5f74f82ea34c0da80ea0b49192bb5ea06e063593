net:Add sysctl_max_skb_frags

Devices may have limits on the number of fragments in an skb they support.
Current codebase uses a constant as maximum for number of fragments one
skb can hold and use.
When enabling scatter/gather and running traffic with many small messages
the codebase uses the maximum number of fragments and may thereby violate
the max for certain devices.
The patch introduces a global variable as max number of fragments.
