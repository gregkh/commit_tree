GFS2: Reintroduce a timeout in function gfs2_gl_hash_clear

At some point in the past, we used to have a timeout when GFS2 was
unmounting, trying to clear out its glocks. If the timeout expires,
it would dump the remaining glocks to the kernel messages so that
developers can debug the problem. That timeout was eliminated,
probably by accident. This patch reintroduces it.
