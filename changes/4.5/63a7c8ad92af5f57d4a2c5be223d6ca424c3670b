drbd: make drbd known to lsblk: use bd_link_disk_holder

lsblk should be able to pick up stacking device driver relations
involving DRBD conveniently.

Even though upstream kernel since 2011 says
	"DON'T USE THIS UNLESS YOU'RE ALREADY USING IT."
a new user has been added since (bcache),
which sets the precedences for us to use it as well.
