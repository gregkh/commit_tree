mm, dax: dax-pmd vs thp-pmd vs hugetlbfs-pmd

A dax-huge-page mapping while it uses some thp helpers is ultimately not
a transparent huge page.  The distinction is especially important in the
get_user_pages() path.  pmd_devmap() is used to distinguish dax-pmds
from pmd_huge() and pmd_trans_huge() which have slightly different
semantics.

Explicitly mark the pmd_trans_huge() helpers that dax needs by adding
pmd_devmap() checks.
