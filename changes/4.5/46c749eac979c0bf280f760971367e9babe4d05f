rhashtable: Remove unnecessary wmb for future_tbl

The patch 9497df88ab5567daa001829051c5f87161a81ff0 ("rhashtable:
Fix reader/rehash race") added a pair of barriers.  In fact the
wmb is superfluous because every subsequent write to the old or
new hash table uses rcu_assign_pointer, which itself carriers a
full barrier prior to the assignment.

Therefore we may remove the explicit wmb.
