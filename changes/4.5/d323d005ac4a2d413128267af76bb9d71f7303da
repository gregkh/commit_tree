f2fs: support file defragment

This patch introduces a new ioctl F2FS_IOC_DEFRAGMENT to support file
defragment in a specified range of regular file.

This ioctl can be used in very limited workload: if user expects high
sequential read performance in randomly written file, this interface
can be used for defragmentation, after that file can be written as
continuous as possible in the device.

Meanwhile, it has side-effect, it will make holes in segments where
blocks located originally, so it's better to trigger GC to eliminate
fragment in segments.
