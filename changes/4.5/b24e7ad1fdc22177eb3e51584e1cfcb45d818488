ALSA: timer: Fix ioctls for X32 ABI

X32 ABI takes the 64bit timespec, thus the timer user status ioctl becomes
incompatible with IA32.  This results in NOTTY error when the ioctl is
issued.

Meanwhile, this struct in X32 is essentially identical with the one in
X86-64, so we can just bypassing to the existing code for this
specific compat ioctl.
