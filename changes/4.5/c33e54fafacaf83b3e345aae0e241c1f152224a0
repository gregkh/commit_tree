powerpc: Fix build break due to paca mm_context_t changes

Commit 2fc251a8dda5 ("powerpc: Copy only required pieces of the
mm_context_t to the paca") broke the build for CONFIG_PPC_STD_MMU_64=y
and CONFIG_PPC_MM_SLICES=n.

That only happens for a kernel built with 4K pages and HUGETLB disabled,
which is why we missed it.

Fix it by adding a mm_ctx_user_psize member to the paca and populating
it in the appropriate places.
