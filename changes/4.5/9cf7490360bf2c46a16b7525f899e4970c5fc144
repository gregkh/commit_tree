tcp: do not drop syn_recv on all icmp reports

Petr Novopashenniy reported that ICMP redirects on SYN_RECV sockets
were leading to RST.

This is of course incorrect.

A specific list of ICMP messages should be able to drop a SYN_RECV.

For instance, a REDIRECT on SYN_RECV shall be ignored, as we do
not hold a dst per SYN_RECV pseudo request.
