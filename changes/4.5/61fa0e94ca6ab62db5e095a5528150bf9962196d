perf top: Delete half-processed hist entries when exit

After sample processing is done, hist entries are in both of
hists->entries and hists->entries_in (or hists->entries_collapsed).  So
I guess perf report does not have leaks on hists.

But for perf top, it's possible to have half-processed entries which are
only in hists->entries_in.  Eventually they will go to the
hists->entries and get freed but they cannot be deleted by current
hists__delete_entries().  This patch adds hists__delete_all_entries
function to delete those entries.
