mm: sanitize page->mapping for tail pages

We don't define meaning of page->mapping for tail pages.  Currently it's
always NULL, which can be inconsistent with head page and potentially
lead to problems.

Let's poison the pointer to catch all illigal uses.

page_rmapping(), page_mapping() and page_anon_vma() are changed to look
on head page.

The only illegal use I've caught so far is __GPF_COMP pages from sound
subsystem, mapped with PTEs.  do_shared_fault() is changed to use
page_rmapping() instead of direct access to fault_page->mapping.
