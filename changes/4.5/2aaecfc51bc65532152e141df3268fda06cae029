perf script: Remove default_scripting_ops

The default script handler (the one that displays samples on screen) is
implemented scripting_ops instance with process_event callback.

This way we can't pass any script config into display function, because
we don't want perl or python handlers to be depended on perf script
internals.

Removing the default_scripting_ops and calling process event function
directly. This way it's possible to pass perf_script struct and process
configuration data in following commit.
