btrfs: allocate root item at snapshot ioctl time

The actual snapshot creation is delayed until transaction commit. If we
cannot get enough memory for the root item there, we have to fail the
whole transaction commit which is bad. So we'll allocate the memory at
the ioctl call and pass it along with the pending_snapshot struct. The
potential ENOMEM will be returned to the caller of snapshot ioctl.
