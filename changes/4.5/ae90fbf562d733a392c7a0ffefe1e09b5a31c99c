ACPICA: Parser: Fix for SuperName method invocation

ACPICA commit 4b86d1046d06e462dae83ebcd5a66cc132a08f8f

SuperName parameters that are in fact control method invocations were
not handled correctly by the parser. This change fixes the problem
by identifying these properly as method invocations. This affects
about 14 different ASL operators that contain SuperName parameters.
ACPICA BZ 1002.
