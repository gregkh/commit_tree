drm: Move LEAVE/ENTER_ATOMIC_MODESET to fbdev helpers

This is only used for kgdb (and previously panic) handlers in
the fbdev emulation, so belongs there.

Note that this means we'll leave behind a forward declaration, but
once all the helper vtables are consolidated (in the next patch) that
will make more sense.

v2: fixup radone/amdgpu.
