ACPI / video: Add a acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses() helper

Several drivers want to know if the acpi-video is generating key-presses
for brightness change hotkeys to avoid sending double key-events to
userspace for these. Currently these driver use this construct for this:

	if (acpi_video_get_backlight_type() == acpi_backlight_vendor)
		report_brightness_key_event();

This indirect way of detecting if acpi-video is active does not make the
code easier to understand, and in some cases it is wrong because just
because the preferred type != vendor does not mean that acpi-video is
actually listening for brightness events, e.g. there may be no acpi-video
bus on the system at all.

This commit adds a acpi_video_handles_brightness_key_presses() helper
function, making the code needing this functionality both easier to read
and more correct.
