NVMe: Remove queue freezing on resets

NVMe submits all commands through the block layer now. This means we
can let requests queue at the blk-mq hardware context since there is no
path that bypasses this anymore so we don't need to freeze the queues
anymore. The driver can simply stop the h/w queues from running during
a reset instead.

This also fixes a WARN in percpu_ref_reinit when the queue was unfrozen
with requeued requests.
