backlight: pwm_bl: Fix broken PWM backlight for non-dt platforms

Commit ee65ad0e2a9e ("backlight: pwm_bl: Avoid backlight flicker when
probed from DT") tries to dereference the device of_node pointer
unconditionally, causing a NULL pointer dereference on non-dt platforms.
Fix it by replacing the phandle variable with a node variable and
by checking that for NULL before dereferencing it.
