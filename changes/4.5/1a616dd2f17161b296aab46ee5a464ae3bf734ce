iwlwifi: dump prph registers in a common place for all transports

Currently the prph registers dump is in the transport layer,
and each bus needs an additional dump implementation.

Move the prph dump outside transport, and allow a common
implementation for all of the buses.
This is possible because prph base addresses are similar for
all buses.
