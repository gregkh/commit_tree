powerpc: Remove UP only lazy floating point and vector optimisations

The UP only lazy floating point and vector optimisations were written
back when SMP was not common, and neither glibc nor gcc used vector
instructions. Now SMP is very common, glibc aggressively uses vector
instructions and gcc autovectorises.

We want to add new optimisations that apply to both UP and SMP, but
in preparation for that remove these UP only optimisations.
