mtd: ubi: wl: avoid erasing a PEB which is empty

wear_leveling_worker() currently unconditionally puts a PEB on erase in
the error case even it just been taken from the free_list and never
used.
In case the PEB was never used it can be put back on the free list
saving a precious erase cycle.

v1â€¦v2:
	- to_leb_clean -> dst_leb_clean
	- use the nested option for ensure_wear_leveling()
	- do_sync_erase() can't go -ENOMEM so we can just go into
	  RO-mode now.
