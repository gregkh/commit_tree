net:hns: Add support of Hip06 SoC to the Hislicon Network Subsystem

This patchset adds support of Hisilicon Hip06 SoC to the existing HNS
ethernet driver.

The changes in the driver are mainly due to changes in the DMA
descriptor provided by the Hip06 ethernet hardware. These changes
need to co-exist with already present Hip05 DMA descriptor and its
operating functions. The decision to choose the correct type of DMA
descriptor is taken dynamically depending upon the version of the
hardware (i.e. V1/hip05 or V2/hip06, see already existing
hisilicon-hns-nic.txt binding file for detailed description). other
changes includes in SBM, DSAF and PPE modules as well. Changes
affecting the driver related to the newly added ethernet hardware
features in Hip06 would be added as separate patch over this and
subsequent patches.
