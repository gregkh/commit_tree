mm: memcontrol: replace mem_cgroup_lruvec_online with mem_cgroup_online

mem_cgroup_lruvec_online() takes lruvec, but it only needs memcg.  Since
get_scan_count(), which is the only user of this function, now possesses
pointer to memcg, let's pass memcg directly to mem_cgroup_online() instead
of picking it out of lruvec and rename the function accordingly.
