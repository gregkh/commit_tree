f2fs: avoid deadlock in f2fs_shrink_extent_tree

While handling extent trees, we can enter into a reclaiming path anytime.
If it tries to release some extent nodes in the same extent tree,
write_lock(&et->lock) would be hanged.
In order to avoid the deadlock, we can just skip it.

Note that, if it is an unreferenced tree, we should get write_lock(&et->lock)
successfully and release all of therein nodes.
