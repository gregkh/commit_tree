dt-bindings: regulator/mfd: Reorganize S5M8767 bindings

The regulator/s5m8767-regulator.txt duplicates some of the information
about bindings with old mfd/s2mps11.txt. Now common part exists entirely
in mfd/samsung,sec-core.txt so:
 - add company prefix to file name (regulator/samsung,s5m8767.txt),
 - remove duplicated information,
 - reorganize the contents to match style of
   regulator/samsung,s2mps11.txt.
