hv_netvsc: Don't ask for additional head room in the skb

The rndis header is 116 bytes big and can be placed in the default
head room that will be available in the skb. Since the netvsc packet
is less than 48 bytes, we can use the skb control buffer
for the netvsc packet. With these changes we don't need to
ask for additional head room.
