ncr5380: Cleanup comments

The CVS revision log is not nearly as useful as the history/history.git
repo, so remove it. Roman's commentary at the top of his driver repeats
the same information elsewhere in the file so remove it. Also remove
some other redundant or obsolete comments.

Both the driver and the datasheets confusingly refer to a DMA access
for a SCSI WRITE command as a "DMA write". Similarly a SCSI READ command
is called a "DMA read". This is the opposite of the usual convention.
Thankfully, the chip documentation and driver code also use "DMA send" and
"DMA receive", so adopt this terminology.

This removes some unimportant discrepancies between the two core driver
forks so that 'diff' can be used to reveal the important ones, to
facilitate reunification.
