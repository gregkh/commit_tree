tracing: Fix freak link error caused by branch tracer

In my randconfig tests, I came across a bug that involves several
components:

* gcc-4.9 through at least 5.3
* CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL enabling -fprofile-arcs for all files
* CONFIG_PROFILE_ALL_BRANCHES overriding every if()
* The optimized implementation of do_div() that tries to
  replace a library call with an division by multiplication
* code in drivers/media/dvb-frontends/zl10353.c doing

        u32 adc_clock = 450560; /* 45.056 MHz */
        if (state->config.adc_clock)
                adc_clock = state->config.adc_clock;
        do_div(value, adc_clock);

In this case, gcc fails to determine whether the divisor
in do_div() is __builtin_constant_p(). In particular, it
concludes that __builtin_constant_p(adc_clock) is false, while
__builtin_constant_p(!!adc_clock) is true.

That in turn throws off the logic in do_div() that also uses
__builtin_constant_p(), and instead of picking either the
constant- optimized division, and the code in ilog2() that uses
__builtin_constant_p() to figure out whether it knows the answer at
compile time. The result is a link error from failing to find
multiple symbols that should never have been called based on
the __builtin_constant_p():

dvb-frontends/zl10353.c:138: undefined reference to `____ilog2_NaN'
dvb-frontends/zl10353.c:138: undefined reference to `__aeabi_uldivmod'
ERROR: "____ilog2_NaN" [drivers/media/dvb-frontends/zl10353.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "__aeabi_uldivmod" [drivers/media/dvb-frontends/zl10353.ko] undefined!

This patch avoids the problem by changing __trace_if() to check
whether the condition is known at compile-time to be nonzero, rather
than checking whether it is actually a constant.

I see this one link error in roughly one out of 1600 randconfig builds
on ARM, and the patch fixes all known instances.
