xfs: refactor and open code log record crc check

Log record CRC verification currently occurs during active log recovery,
immediately before a log record is unpacked. Therefore, the CRC
calculation code is buried within the data unpack function. CRC
verification pass support only needs to go so far as check the CRC, but
this is not easily allowed as the code is currently organized.

Since we now have a new log record processing helper, pull the record
CRC verification code out from the unpack helper and open-code it at the
top of the new process helper. This facilitates the ability to modify
how records are processed based on the type of the current pass. This
patch contains no functional changes.
