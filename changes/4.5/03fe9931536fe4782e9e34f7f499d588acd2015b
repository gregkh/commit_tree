svcrdma: Define maximum number of backchannel requests

Extra resources for handling backchannel requests have to be
pre-allocated when a transport instance is created. Set up
additional fields in svcxprt_rdma to track these resources.

The max_requests fields are elements of the RPC-over-RDMA
protocol, so they should be u32. To ensure that unsigned
arithmetic is used everywhere, some other fields in the
svcxprt_rdma struct are updated.
