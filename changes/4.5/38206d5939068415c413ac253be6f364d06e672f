tipc: narrow down interface towards struct tipc_link

We move the definition of struct tipc_link from link.h to link.c in
order to minimize its exposure to the rest of the code.

When needed, we define new functions to make it possible for external
entities to access and set data in the link.

Apart from the above, there are no functional changes.
