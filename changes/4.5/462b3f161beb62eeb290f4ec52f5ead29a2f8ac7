ALSA: compress: Disable GET_CODEC_CAPS ioctl for some architectures

Some architectures like PowerPC can handle the maximum struct size in
an ioctl only up to 13 bits, and struct snd_compr_codec_caps used by
SNDRV_COMPRESS_GET_CODEC_CAPS ioctl overflows this limit.  This
problem was revealed recently by a powerpc change, as it's now treated
as a fatal build error.

This patch is a stop-gap for that: for architectures with less than 14
bit ioctl struct size, get rid of the handling of the relevant ioctl.
We should provide an alternative equivalent ioctl code later, but for
now just paper over it.  Luckily, the compress API hasn't been used on
such architectures, so the impact must be effectively zero.
