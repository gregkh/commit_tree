powerpc/476fpe: Add support for kexec

PPC476FPE has a different PVR from previous PPC476 processors. The
kexec code checks the PVR in order to correctly setup the MMU. When
the initial support for 476FPE processors was added the corresponding
change in the kexec code was missed. This patch simply adds the check
and solves the following bug on kexec:

kexec: Starting new kernel
