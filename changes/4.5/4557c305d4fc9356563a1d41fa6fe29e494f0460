ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add support for active suspend

Some of the usecases can be marked as 'ignore_suspend' by
machine. For these on suspend we should keep audio controller
ON by saving the state and not suspending the device

For this we need to maintain a counter for these streams and be
active on suspend when such a stream is opened.
