platform/x86: Add Intel Telemetry Core Driver

Intel PM Telemetry is a software mechanism via which various SoC
PM and performance related parameters like PM counters, firmware
trace verbosity, the status of different devices inside the SoC, etc.
can be monitored and analyzed. The different samples that may be
monitored can be configured at runtime via exported APIs.

This patch adds the telemetry core driver that implements basic
exported APIs.
