powerpc/powernv: Fix OPAL_CONSOLE_FLUSH prototype and usages

The recently added OPAL API call, OPAL_CONSOLE_FLUSH, originally took no
parameters and returned nothing.  The call was updated to accept the
terminal number to flush, and returned various values depending on the
state of the output buffer.

The prototype has been updated and its usage in the OPAL kmsg dumper has
been modified to support its new behaviour as an incremental flush.
