mtd: partitions: support a cleanup callback for parsers

If partition parsers need to clean up their resources, we shouldn't
assume that all memory will fit in a single kmalloc() that the caller
can kfree(). We should allow the parser to provide a proper cleanup
routine.

Note that this means we need to keep a hold on the parser's module for a
bit longer, and release it later with mtd_part_parser_put().

Alongside this, define a default callback that we'll automatically use
if the parser doesn't provide one, so we can still retain the old
behavior.
