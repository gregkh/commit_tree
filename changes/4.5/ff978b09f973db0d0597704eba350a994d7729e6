ext4 crypto: move context consistency check to ext4_file_open()

In the case where the per-file key for the directory is cached, but
root does not have access to the key needed to derive the per-file key
for the files in the directory, we allow the lookup to succeed, so
that lstat(2) and unlink(2) can suceed.  However, if a program tries
to open the file, it will get an ENOKEY error.
