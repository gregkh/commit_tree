mtd: nand: use nand_check_erased_ecc_chunk in default ECC read functions

The default NAND read functions are relying on the underlying controller
driver to correct bitflips, but some of those controllers cannot properly
fix bitflips in erased pages.
Check for bitflips in erased pages in default core functions if the driver
delegated the this check by setting the NAND_ECC_GENERIC_ERASED_CHECK flag.
