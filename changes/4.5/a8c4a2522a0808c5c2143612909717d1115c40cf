ipv4: only create late gso-skb if skb is already set up with CHECKSUM_PARTIAL

Otherwise we break the contract with GSO to only pass CHECKSUM_PARTIAL
skbs down. This can easily happen with UDP+IPv4 sockets with the first
MSG_MORE write smaller than the MTU, second write is a sendfile.

Returning -EOPNOTSUPP lets the callers fall back into normal sendmsg path,
were we calculate the checksum manually during copying.

Commit d749c9cbffd6 ("ipv4: no CHECKSUM_PARTIAL on MSG_MORE corked
sockets") started to exposes this bug.
