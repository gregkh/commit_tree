KVM: x86: MMU: Move parent_pte handling from kvm_mmu_get_page() to link_shadow_page()

Every time kvm_mmu_get_page() is called with a non-NULL parent_pte
argument, link_shadow_page() follows that to set the parent entry so
that the new mapping will point to the returned page table.

Moving parent_pte handling there allows to clean up the code because
parent_pte is passed to kvm_mmu_get_page() just for mark_unsync() and
mmu_page_add_parent_pte().

In addition, the patch avoids calling mark_unsync() for other parents in
the sp->parent_ptes chain than the newly added parent_pte, because they
have been there since before the current page fault handling started.
