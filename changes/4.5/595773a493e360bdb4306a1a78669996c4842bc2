dell-wmi: Check if Dell WMI descriptor structure is valid

After examining existing DSDT ACPI tables of more laptops and looking
into Dell WMI document mentioned in ML dicussion archived at
http://www.spinics.net/lists/platform-driver-x86/msg07220.html we will
parse and check WMI descriptor if contains expected data. It is because
WMI descriptor contains interface version number and it is needed to
know in next commit.
