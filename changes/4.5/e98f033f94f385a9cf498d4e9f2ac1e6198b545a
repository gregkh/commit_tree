cpupower: fix how "cpupower frequency-info" interprets latency

the intel-pstate driver does not support the ondemand governor and does not
have a valid value in
/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu[x]/cpufreq/cpuinfo_transition_latency. The
intel-pstate driver sets cpuinfo_transition_latency to CPUFREQ_ETERNAL (-1),
the value written into cpuinfo_transition_latency is defind as an unsigned
int so checking the read value against max unsigned int will determine if the
value is valid.
