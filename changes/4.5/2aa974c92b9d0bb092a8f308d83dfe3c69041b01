drm/i915: Update connector_mask during readout, v2.

drm/i915: Update connector_mask during readout, v2.

The connector_mask may be used any time during the non-atomic
.crtc_disable which is called before the full atomic state is
set up and needs to be accurate for that reason.

Changes since v1:
- Update connector_mask in readout_hw_state and add a comment.
