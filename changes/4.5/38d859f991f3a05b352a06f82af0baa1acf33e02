IMA: policy can now be updated multiple times

The new rules get appended to the original policy, forming a queue.
The new rules are first added to a temporary list, which on error
get released without disturbing the normal IMA operations.  On
success both lists (the current policy and the new rules) are spliced.

IMA policy reads are many orders of magnitude more numerous compared to
writes, the match code is RCU protected.  The updater side also does
list splice in RCU manner.
