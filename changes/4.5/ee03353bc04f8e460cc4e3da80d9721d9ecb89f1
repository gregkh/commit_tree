arm64: entry: remove pointless SPSR mode check

In work_pending, we may skip work if the stacked SPSR value represents
anything other than an EL0 context. We then immediately invoke the
kernel_exit 0 macro as part of ret_to_user, assuming a return to EL0.
This is somewhat confusing.

We use work_pending as part of the ret_to_user/ret_fast_syscall state
machine. We only use ret_fast_syscall in the return from an SVC issued
from EL0. We use ret_to_user for return from EL0 exception handlers and
also for return from ret_from_fork in the case the task was not a kernel
thread (i.e. it is a user task).

Thus in all cases the stacked SPSR value must represent an EL0 context,
and the check is redundant. This patch removes it, along with the now
unused no_work_pending label.
