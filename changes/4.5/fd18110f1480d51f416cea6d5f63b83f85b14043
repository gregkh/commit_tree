ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add support for Mic Select module

Mic select is a DSP module which is used to select one or many
inputs to form an output. This is useful to select data
selectively from PDM input and hence the name. This module is of
generic module type.

This patch adds support to add and configure Mic select module in
firmware topology.
