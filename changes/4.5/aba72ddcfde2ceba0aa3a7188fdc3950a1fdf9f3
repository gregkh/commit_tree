pci: Decouple quirks.c from i915_reg.h

i915 register defines are going to become type safe, so going forward
the register defines can't be used as straight numbers. Since quirks.c
needs just a few extra register defines from i915_reg.h, decouple the
two by defining the required registers locally in quirks.c. This was
already done for a few other igpu related registers.
