ARM: dts: at91: sama5d2 xplained: add phy address and IRQ for macb0

After 57a38effa598 (net: phy: micrel: disable broadcast for KSZ8081/KSZ8091)
the macb0 interface has difficulties to come back from power saving mode if
address not explicitly set up.
As the micrel phy on the board is actually configured to show up at address 1
we use this explicitly.
Adding the phy node and its real address fixes the issue.

The phy IRQ and associated pinmux node is also added.
