perf: Synchronously clean up child events

The orphan cleanup workqueue doesn't always catch orphans, for example,
if they never schedule after they are orphaned. IOW, the event leak is
still very real. It also wouldn't work for kernel counters.

Doing it synchonously is a little hairy due to lock inversion issues,
but is made to work.

Patch based on work by Alexander Shishkin.
