net: ethernet: arc: Keep emac compatibility for more Rockchip SoCs

On the RK3066/RK3188, there was fixed GRF offset configuration to set emac
and fixed DIV2 mac TX/RX clock. So, we need to easily set and fit to other
SoCs (RK3036) which maybe have different GRF offset, and need adjust mac
TX/RX clock.
