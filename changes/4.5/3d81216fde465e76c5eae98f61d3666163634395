reset: Fix of_reset_control_get() for consistent return values

When of_reset_control_get() is called without connection ID it returns
-ENOENT when the 'resets' property doesn't exists or is an empty entry.
However when a connection ID is given it returns -EINVAL when the 'resets'
property doesn't exists or the requested name can't be found. This is
because the error code returned by of_property_match_string() is just
passed down as an index to of_parse_phandle_with_args(), which then
returns -EINVAL.

To get a consistent return value with both code paths we must return
-ENOENT when of_property_match_string() fails.
