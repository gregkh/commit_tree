device property: Take a copy of the property set

It is convenient if the property set associated with the device secondary
firmware node is a copy of the original. This allows passing property set
from a stack for example for devices created dynamically. This also ties
the property set lifetime to the associated device.

Because of that we provide new function device_remove_property_set() that
is used to disassociate and release memory allocated for the property set.
