xfs: get mp from bma->ip in xfs_bmap code

In my earlier commit

  c29aad4 xfs: pass mp to XFS_WANT_CORRUPTED_GOTO

I added some local mp variables with code which indicates that
mp might be NULL.  Coverity doesn't like this now, because the
updated per-fs XFS_STATS macros dereference mp.

I don't think this is actually a problem; from what I can tell,
we cannot get to these functions with a null bma->tp, so my NULL
check was probably pointless.  Still, it's not super obvious.

So switch this code to get mp from the inode on the xfs_bmalloca
structure, with no conditional, because the functions are already
using bmap->ip directly.
