ALSA: hda - Fixup speaker pass-through control for nid 0x14 on ALC225

On one of the machines we enable, we found that the actual speaker volume
did not always correspond to the volume set in alsamixer. This patch
fixes that problem.

This patch was orginally written by Kailang @ Realtek, I've rebased it
to fit sound git master.
