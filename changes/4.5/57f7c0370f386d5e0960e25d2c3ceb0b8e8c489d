asm-generic: guard smp_store_release/load_acquire

Allow architectures to override smp_store_release
and smp_load_acquire by guarding the defines
in asm-generic/barrier.h with ifndef directives.

This is in preparation to reusing asm-generic/barrier.h
on architectures which have their own definition
of these macros.
