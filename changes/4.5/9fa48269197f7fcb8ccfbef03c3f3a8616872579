drbd: prevent NULL pointer deref when resuming diskless primary

In a multiple error scenario, we may end up with a "frozen" Primary,
that has no access to any data (no local disk, no replication link).

If we then resume-io, we try to generate a new data generation id,
which will fail if there is no longer a local disk.

Double check for available local data,
which prevents the NULL pointer deref.

If we are diskless, turn the resume-io in this situation
into the first stage of a "force down", by bumping the "effective" data
gen id, which will prevent later attach or connect to the former data
set without first being demoted (deconfigured).
