soreuseport: pass skb to secondary UDP socket lookup

This socket-lookup path did not pass along the skb in question
in my original BPF-based socket selection patch.  The skb in the
udpN_lib_lookup2 path can be used for BPF-based socket selection just
like it is in the 'traditional' udpN_lib_lookup path.

udpN_lib_lookup2 kicks in when there are greater than 10 sockets in
the same hlist slot.  Coincidentally, I chose 10 sockets per
reuseport group in my functional test, so the lookup2 path was not
excersised. This adds an additional set of tests with 20 sockets.

Fixes: 538950a1b752 ("soreuseport: setsockopt SO_ATTACH_REUSEPORT_[CE]BPF")
Fixes: 3ca8e4029969 ("soreuseport: BPF selection functional test")
