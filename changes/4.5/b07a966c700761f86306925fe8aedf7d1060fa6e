mlxsw: spectrum: Add error paths to __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_add

The operation of adding VLANs on a port via switchdev ops can fail and
we need to be prepared for it. If we do not rollback hardware operations
following a failure, hardware and software will remain in an
inconsistent state.

Solve that by adding suitable error paths to __mlxsw_sp_port_vlans_add.
