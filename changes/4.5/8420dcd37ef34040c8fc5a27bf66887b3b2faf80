arm: KVM: Make kvm_arm.h friendly to assembly code

kvm_arm.h is included from both C code and assembly code; however some
definitions in this header supplied with U/UL/ULL suffixes which might
confuse assembly once they got evaluated.
We have _AC macro for such cases, so just wrap problem places with it.
