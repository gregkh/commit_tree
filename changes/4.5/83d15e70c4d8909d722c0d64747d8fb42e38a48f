tcp_yeah: don't set ssthresh below 2

For tcp_yeah, use an ssthresh floor of 2, the same floor used by Reno
and CUBIC, per RFC 5681 (equation 4).

tcp_yeah_ssthresh() was sometimes returning a 0 or negative ssthresh
value if the intended reduction is as big or bigger than the current
cwnd. Congestion control modules should never return a zero or
negative ssthresh. A zero ssthresh generally results in a zero cwnd,
causing the connection to stall. A negative ssthresh value will be
interpreted as a u32 and will set a target cwnd for PRR near 4
billion.

Oleksandr Natalenko reported that a system using tcp_yeah with ECN
could see a warning about a prior_cwnd of 0 in
tcp_cwnd_reduction(). Testing verified that this was due to
tcp_yeah_ssthresh() misbehaving in this way.
