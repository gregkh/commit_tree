mmc: tegra: implement UHS tuning

This implements the UHS tuning sequence in a similar way to the one
contained in the TRM. It deviates in the way how to check if the tap
value is passing, by using the common Linux MMC function, which does
not only check for data CRC errors, but also if the received block
pattern is correct.
