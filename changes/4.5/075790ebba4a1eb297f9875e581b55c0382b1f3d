NVMe: Use IDA for namespace disk naming

A namespace may be detached from a controller, but a user may be holding
a reference to it. Attaching a new namespace with the same NSID will create
duplicate names when using the NSID to name the disk.

This patch uses an IDA that is released only when the last reference is
released instead of using the namespace ID.
