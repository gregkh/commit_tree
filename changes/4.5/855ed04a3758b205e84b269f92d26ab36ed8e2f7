usb: gadget: udc-core: independent registration of gadgets and gadget drivers

Change behavior during registration of gadgets and
gadget drivers in udc-core. Instead of previous
approach when for successful probe of usb gadget driver
at least one usb gadget should be already registered
use another one where gadget drivers and gadgets
can be registered in udc-core independently.

Independent registration of gadgets and gadget drivers
is useful for built-in into kernel gadget and gadget
driver case - because it's possible that gadget is
really probed only on late_init stage (due to deferred
probe) whereas gadget driver's probe is silently failed
on module_init stage due to no any UDC added.

Also it is useful for modules case - now there is no
difference what module to insert first: gadget module
or gadget driver one.
