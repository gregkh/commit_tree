perf/core: Plug potential memory leak in CPU_UP_PREPARE

If CPU_UP_PREPARE is called it is not guaranteed, that a previously allocated
and assigned hash has been freed already, but perf_event_init_cpu()
unconditionally allocates and assignes a new hash if the swhash is referenced.
By overwriting the pointer the existing hash is not longer accessible.

Verify that there is no hash assigned on this cpu before allocating and
assigning a new one.
