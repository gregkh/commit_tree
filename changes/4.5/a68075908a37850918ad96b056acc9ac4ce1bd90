lib/ucs2_string: Correct ucs2 -> utf8 conversion

The comparisons should be >= since 0x800 and 0x80 require an additional bit
to store.

For the 3 byte case, the existing shift would drop off 2 more bits than
intended.

For the 2 byte case, there should be 5 bits bits in byte 1, and 6 bits in
byte 2.
