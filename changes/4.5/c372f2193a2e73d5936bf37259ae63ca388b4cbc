ocfs2/dlm: return appropriate value when dlm_grab() returns NULL

dlm_grab() may return NULL when the node is doing unmount.  When doing
code review, we found that some dlm handlers may return error to caller
when dlm_grab() returns NULL and make caller BUG or other problems.
Here is an example:

Node 1                                 Node 2
receives migration message
from node 3, and send
migrate request to others
                                     start unmounting

                                     receives migrate request
                                     from node 1 and call
                                     dlm_migrate_request_handler()

                                     unmount thread unregisters
                                     domain handlers and removes
                                     dlm_context from dlm_domains

                                     dlm_migrate_request_handlers()
                                     returns -EINVAL to node 1
Exit migration neither clearing the
migration state nor sending
assert master message to node 3 which
cause node 3 hung.
