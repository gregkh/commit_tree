Input: xpad - handle "present" and "gone" correctly

Handle the "a new device is present" message properly by dynamically
creating the input device at this point in time. This means we now do not
"preallocate" all 4 devices when a single wireless base station is seen.
This requires a workqueue as we are in interrupt context when we learn
about this.

Also properly disconnect any devices that we are told are removed.
