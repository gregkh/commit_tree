clk: st: avoid uninitialized variable use

quadfs_pll_fs660c32_round_rate prints a few structure members
that are never initialized, and also doesn't print the only one
it cares about. We get a gcc warning about the ones that
are printed:

clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c:560:93: warning: 'params.sdiv' may be used uninitialized in this function
clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c:560:93: warning: 'params.mdiv' may be used uninitialized in this function
clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c:560:93: warning: 'params.pe' may be used uninitialized in this function
clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c:560:93: warning: 'params.nsdiv' may be used uninitialized in this function

This changes the code to no longer print uninitialized data, and
for good measure it also prints the ndiv member that is being
set.
