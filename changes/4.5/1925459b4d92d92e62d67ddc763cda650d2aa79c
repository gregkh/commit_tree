tools build: Fix feature Makefile issues with 'O='

When building perf binaries outside the source tree with 'make O=<dir>',
the auto-detected features get re-tested for every build, which is
unnecessary and inconsistent with the behavior seen when building
directly in the source tree.

Another issue is that 'make O=<dir> clean' doesn't remove the feature
files from the object tree.

Fix these problems by looking for the binaries in the $(OUTPUT)
directory.
