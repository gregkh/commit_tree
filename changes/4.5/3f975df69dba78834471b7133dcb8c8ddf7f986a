s390/sclp: Add VT220 support to early sclp console

When running under qemu with the default configuration (-nographic),
there is only a VT220 SCLP console, no line-mode SCLP console. Add
VT220 support to the early SCLP console so the user has a chance to
see critical error messages during early boot.

None of the existing users of _sclp_print_early() check the return
code. Instead of trying to come up with return code semantics when
printing to multiple consoles (any or all of which may fail), we just
drop the return code entirely.

Tested on z/VM (line mode console) and LPAR (VT220 and line mode
console). Tested on qemu/KVM with VT220 console and / or line mode
console.
