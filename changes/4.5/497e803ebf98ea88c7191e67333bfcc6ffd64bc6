MIPS: smp-cps: Ensure secondary cores start with EVA disabled

The kernel currently assumes that a core will start up in legacy mode
using the exception base provided through the CM GCR registers. If a
core has been configured in hardware to start in EVA mode, these
assumptions will fail.

This patch ensures that secondary cores are initialized to meet these
assumptions.
