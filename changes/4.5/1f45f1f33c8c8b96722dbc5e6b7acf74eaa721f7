clocksource: Make clocksource validation work for all clocksources

The clocksource validation which makes sure that the newly read value
is not smaller than the last value only works if the clocksource mask
is 64bit, i.e. the counter is 64bit wide. But we want to use that
mechanism also for clocksources which are less than 64bit wide.

So instead of checking whether bit 63 is set, we check whether the
most significant bit of the clocksource mask is set in the delta
result. If it is set, we return 0.

[ tglx: Simplified the implementation, added a comment and massaged
  	the commit message ]
