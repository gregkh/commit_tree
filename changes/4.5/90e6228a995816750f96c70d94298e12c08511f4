Staging: comedi: das16: Fix sparse endian warning

Fix following sparse warning:
warning: cast to restricted __le16

This change is safe because array is pointer of type void and can
be used to store any type of data, also offset of the array would
be the same since unsigned short and __le16 are both 16 bits in size.
