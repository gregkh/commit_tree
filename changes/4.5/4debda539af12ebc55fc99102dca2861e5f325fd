ACPICA: Namespace: Add scope information to the simple object repair mechanism

ACPICA commit 51cbd324420ca5e381cb2c57ce95139053518a35

The acpi_object_converter callbacks are lack in scope information to
convert name_string. This patch fixes this issue by passing the evaluation
method/object node to the converter callbacks. Lv Zheng.
