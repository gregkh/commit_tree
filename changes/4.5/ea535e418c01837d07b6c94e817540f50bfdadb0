dma-debug: switch check from _text to _stext

In include/asm-generic/sections.h:

  /*
   * Usage guidelines:
   * _text, _data: architecture specific, don't use them in
   * arch-independent code
   * [_stext, _etext]: contains .text.* sections, may also contain
   * .rodata.*
   *                   and/or .init.* sections

_text is not guaranteed across architectures.  Architectures such as ARM
may reuse parts which are not actually text and erroneously trigger a bug.
Switch to using _stext which is guaranteed to contain text sections.
