perf tools: Clear struct machine during machine__init()

There are so many test cases use stack allocated 'struct machine'.
Including:
  test__hists_link
  test__hists_filter
  test__mmap_thread_lookup
  test__thread_mg_share
  test__hists_output
  test__hists_cumulate

Also, in non-test code (for example, machine__new_host()) there are
code use 'malloc()' to alloc struct machine.

These are dangerous operations, cause some tests fail or hung in
machines__exit(). For example, in

 machines__exit ->
   machine__destroy_kernel_maps ->
     map_groups__remove ->
       maps__remove ->
         pthread_rwlock_wrlock

a incorrectly initialized lock causes unintended behavior.

This patch memset(0) that structure in machine__init() to ensure all
fields in 'struct machine' are initialized to zero.
