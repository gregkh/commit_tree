mm, thp: adjust conditions when we can reuse the page on WP fault

With new refcounting we will be able map the same compound page with
PTEs and PMDs.  It requires adjustment to conditions when we can reuse
the page on write-protection fault.

For PTE fault we can't reuse the page if it's part of huge page.

For PMD we can only reuse the page if nobody else maps the huge page or
it's part.  We can do it by checking page_mapcount() on each sub-page,
but it's expensive.

The cheaper way is to check page_count() to be equal 1: every mapcount
takes page reference, so this way we can guarantee, that the PMD is the
only mapping.

This approach can give false negative if somebody pinned the page, but
that doesn't affect correctness.
