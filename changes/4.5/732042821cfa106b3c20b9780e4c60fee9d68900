radix-tree: fix oops after radix_tree_iter_retry

Helper radix_tree_iter_retry() resets next_index to the current index.
In following radix_tree_next_slot current chunk size becomes zero.  This
isn't checked and it tries to dereference null pointer in slot.

Tagged iterator is fine because retry happens only at slot 0 where tag
bitmask in iter->tags is filled with single bit.
