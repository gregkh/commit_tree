IB/mlx5: Fix RC transport send queue overhead computation

Fix the RC QPs send queue overhead computation to take into account
two additional segments in the WQE which are needed for registration
operations.

The ATOMIC and UMR segments can't coexist together, so chose maximum out
of them.

The commit 9e65dc371b5c ("IB/mlx5: Fix RC transport send queue overhead
computation") was intended to update RC transport as commit messages
states, but added the code to UC transport.
