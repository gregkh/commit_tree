nvme: move namespace scanning to common code

The namespace scanning code has been mostly generic already, we just
need to store a pointer to the tagset in the nvme_ctrl structure, and
add a method to check if a controller is I/O incapable.  The latter
will hopefully be replaced by a proper controller state machine soon.
