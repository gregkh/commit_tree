s390/cio: Change I/O instructions from inline to normal functions

Adding tracepoints to inline functions adds tracepoint invocation code
for each instance where the function is inlined. The resulting increase
in kernel code size can have negative impact:
 - More cache misses in instruction cache
 - Reduced amount of DMA-capable memory

Therefore change all functions implementing I/O instructions from inline
to normal functions.

Bloat-o-meter summary after change (using performance_defconfig):

  add/remove: 24/2 grow/shrink: 4/39 up/down: 2205/-4858 (-2653)
