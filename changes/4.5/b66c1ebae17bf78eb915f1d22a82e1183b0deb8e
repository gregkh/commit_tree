ARM: dts: bockw: Add compatible property to "partitions" node

As of commit e488ca9f8d4f62c2 ("doc: dt: mtd: partitions: add compatible
property to "partitions" node"), the "partitions" subnode of an SPI
FLASH device node must have a compatible property. The partitions are no
longer detected if it is not present.
