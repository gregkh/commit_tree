Eliminate the .eh_frame sections from the aarch64 vmlinux and kernel modules

By default the aarch64 gcc generates .eh_frame sections.  Unlike
.debug_frame sections, the .eh_frame sections are loaded into memory
when the associated code is loaded.  On an example kernel being built
with this default the .eh_frame section in vmlinux used an extra 1.7MB
of memory.  The x86 disables the creation of the .eh_frame section.
The aarch64 should probably do the same to save some memory.
