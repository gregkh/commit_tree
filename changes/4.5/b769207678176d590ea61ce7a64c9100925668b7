lightnvm: use system block for mm initialization

Use system block information to register the appropriate media manager.
This enables the LightNVM subsystem to instantiate a media manager
selected by the user, instead of relying on automatic detection by each
media manager loaded in the kernel.

A device must now be initialized before it can proceed to initialize its
media manager. Upon initialization, the configured media manager is
automatically initialized as well.
