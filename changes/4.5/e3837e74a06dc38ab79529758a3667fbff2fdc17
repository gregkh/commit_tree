tpm_tis: Refactor the interrupt setup

Now that the probe and run cases are merged together we can use a
much simpler setup flow where probe and normal setup are done with
exactly the same code.

Since the new flow always calls tpm_gen_interrupt to confirm the IRQ
there is also no longer any need to call tpm_get_timeouts twice.
