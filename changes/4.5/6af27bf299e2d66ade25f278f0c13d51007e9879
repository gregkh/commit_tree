serial: sh-sci: Add support for optional external (H)SCK input

Add support for using the SCIx clock pin "(H)SCK" as an external clock
input on (H)SCI(F), providing the sampling clock.

Note that this feature is not yet supported on the select SCIFA variants
that also have it (e.g. sh7723, sh7724, and r8a7740).

On (H)SCIF variants with an External Baud Rate Generator (BRG), the
BRG Clock Select Register must be configured for the external clock.
