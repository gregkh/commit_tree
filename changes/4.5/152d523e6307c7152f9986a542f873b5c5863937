powerpc: Create context switch helpers save_sprs() and restore_sprs()

Move all our context switch SPR save and restore code into two
helpers. We do a few optimisations:

- Group all mfsprs and all mtsprs. In many cases an mtspr sets a
scoreboarding bit that an mfspr waits on, so the current practise of
mfspr A; mtspr A; mfpsr B; mtspr B is the worst scheduling we can
do.

- SPR writes are slow, so check that the value is changing before
writing it.

A context switch microbenchmark using yield():

./context_switch2 --test=yield 0 0

shows an improvement of almost 10% on POWER8.
