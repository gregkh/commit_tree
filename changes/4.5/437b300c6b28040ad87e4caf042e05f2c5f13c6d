You're right, I was focusing on the panic that I could easily reproduce.
I'm still not sure how I could trigger those other conditions.

That sounds fine to me -- updated patch attached.

Subject: [PATCH] auth_gss: remove the BUG() from gss_pipe_downcall()

Instead return a generic error via gss_msg->msg.errno.  None of the
errors returned by gss_fill_context() should necessarily trigger a
kernel panic.
