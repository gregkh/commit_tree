ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: Remove legacy IOMMU attr and addrs

OMAP4 has been DT-boot only for some time, and the legacy-mode
device creation logic for IOMMU devices has also been cleaned up,
so the dev_attr and address data is no longer required. So, remove
these attribute data and hwmod addr space for the IPU & DSP IOMMU
devices.
