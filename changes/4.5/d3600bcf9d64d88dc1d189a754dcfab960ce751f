KEYS: prevent keys from being removed from specified keyrings

Userspace should not be allowed to remove keys from certain keyrings
(eg. blacklist), though the keys themselves can expire.

This patch defines a new key flag named KEY_FLAG_KEEP to prevent
userspace from being able to unlink, revoke, invalidate or timed
out a key on a keyring.  When this flag is set on the keyring, all
keys subsequently added are flagged.

In addition, when this flag is set, the keyring itself can not be
cleared.
