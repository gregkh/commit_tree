net: introduce change lower state notifier

When lower device like bonding slave, team/bridge port, etc changes its
state, it is useful for others to notice this change. Currently this is
implemented specificly for bonding as NETDEV_BONDING_INFO notifier. This
patch aims to replace this specific usage and make this more generic to
be used for all upper-lower devices.

Introduce NETDEV_CHANGELOWERSTATE netdev notifier type and
netdev_lower_state_changed() helper.
