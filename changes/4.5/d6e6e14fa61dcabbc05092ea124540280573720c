drm: modes: Revert cc344980c767 "replace simple_strtoul by kstrtouint"

My latest commit introduce some case where a valid mode, could be
rejected.
simple_strtox functions stop at first non-digit character, but kstrtox
not.
So args like "video=HDMI-A-1:720x480-16@60" will be reject when checking
16@.

Discussions about this change comes to the conclusion that the best
solution is to revert my commit cc344980c76748e57c9c03100c2a14d36ab00334.
