rcu: Don't redundantly disable irqs in rcu_irq_{enter,exit}()

This commit replaces a local_irq_save()/local_irq_restore() pair with
a lockdep assertion that interrupts are already disabled.  This should
remove the corresponding overhead from the interrupt entry/exit fastpaths.

This change was inspired by the fact that Iftekhar Ahmed's mutation
testing showed that removing rcu_irq_enter()'s call to local_ird_restore()
had no effect, which might indicate that interrupts were always enabled
anyway.
