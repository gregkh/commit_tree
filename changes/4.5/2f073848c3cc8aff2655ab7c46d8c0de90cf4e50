list: Use WRITE_ONCE() when initializing list_head structures

Code that does lockless emptiness testing of non-RCU lists is relying
on INIT_LIST_HEAD() to write the list head's ->next pointer atomically,
particularly when INIT_LIST_HEAD() is invoked from list_del_init().
This commit therefore adds WRITE_ONCE() to this function's pointer stores
that could affect the head's ->next pointer.
