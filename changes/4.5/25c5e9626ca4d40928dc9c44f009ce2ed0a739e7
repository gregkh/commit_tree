dmaengine: at_xdmac: fix residue computation

When computing the residue we need two pieces of information: the current
descriptor and the remaining data of the current descriptor. To get
that information, we need to read consecutively two registers but we
can't do it in an atomic way. For that reason, we have to check manually
that current descriptor has not changed.
