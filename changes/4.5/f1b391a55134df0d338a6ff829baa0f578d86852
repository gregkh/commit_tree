drm/i915/skl: While sanitizing cdclock check the SWF18 as well

SWF18 is set if the display has been initialized by the pre-os. It also
gives what configuration is enabled on which pipe. In skl_sanitize_cdclk,
the DPLL sanity check can pass even if GOP/VBIOS is not loaded as BIOS
enables DPLL for integrated audio codec related programming.
So fisrt check if SWF18 is set and then follow through with other DPLL
and CDCLK verification. If not set then for sure we need to sanitize the
cdclock.

v2: Update the commit message for clarity (Siva)
v3: Correct the mask to check for bits[23:0] instead of only bits[16:0].
    Had missed checking for PIPE C altogether. Remaining are reserved (Siva)
v4: Use ILK_SWF macro for SWF register definitions. Taken from Ville's patch
