sched/core: Move the sched_to_prio[] arrays out of line

When building a kernel with a gcc 6 snapshot the compiler complains
about unused const static variables for prio_to_weight and prio_to_mult
for multiple scheduler files (all but core.c and autogroup.c)

The way the array is currently declared it will be duplicated in
every scheduler file that includes sched.h, which seems rather wasteful.

Move the array out of line into core.c. I also added a sched_ prefix
to avoid any potential name space collisions.
