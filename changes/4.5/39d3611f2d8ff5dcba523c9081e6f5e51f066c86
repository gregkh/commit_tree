clocksource/drivers/dw_apb_timer: Use {readl|writel}_relaxed in critical path

It's safe to use the relaxed version. From another side, the relaxed io
accessor macros are available on all architectures now, so we can use
the relaxed versions to get a trivial system performance improvement,
we measured time the following functions spent on Marvell BG4CT:

4096 rounds of __apbt_read_clocksource() call:

before the patch: 1263240ns on average
after the patch: 1250080ns on average
improved by 1%

4096 rounds of apbt_eoi() call:

before the patch: 1290960ns on average
after the patch: 1248240ns on average

4096 rounds of apbt_next_event() call:

before the patch: 3333660ns on average
after the patch: 1322040ns on average

improved by 60%!
