KVM: arm64: Fix host stage-2 PGD refcount

The KVM page-table library refcounts the pages of concatenated stage-2
PGDs individually. However, when running KVM in protected mode, the
host's stage-2 PGD is currently managed by EL2 as a single high-order
compound page, which can cause the refcount of the tail pages to reach 0
when they shouldn't, hence corrupting the page-table.

Fix this by introducing a new hyp_split_page() helper in the EL2 page
allocator (matching the kernel's split_page() function), and make use of
it from host_s2_zalloc_pages_exact().
