net: hns3: fix vf reset workqueue cannot exit

The task of VF reset is performed through the workqueue. It checks the
value of hdev->reset_pending to determine whether to exit the loop.
However, the value of hdev->reset_pending may also be assigned by
the interrupt function hclgevf_misc_irq_handle(), which may cause the
loop fail to exit and keep occupying the workqueue. This loop is not
necessary, so remove it and the workqueue will be rescheduled if the
reset needs to be retried or a new reset occurs.
