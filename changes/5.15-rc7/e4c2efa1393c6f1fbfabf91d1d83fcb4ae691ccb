ice: fix getting UDP tunnel entry

Correct parameters order in call to ice_tunnel_idx_to_entry function.

Entry in sparse port table is correct when the idx is 0. For idx 1 one
correct entry should be skipped, for idx 2 two of them should be skipped
etc. Change if condition to be true when idx is 0, which means that
previous valid entry of this tunnel type were skipped.
