mm/migrate: fix CPUHP state to update node demotion order

The node demotion order needs to be updated during CPU hotplug.  Because
whether a NUMA node has CPU may influence the demotion order.  The
update function should be called during CPU online/offline after the
node_states[N_CPU] has been updated.  That is done in
CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN during CPU online and in CPUHP_MM_VMSTAT_DEAD during
CPU offline.  But in commit 884a6e5d1f93 ("mm/migrate: update node
demotion order on hotplug events"), the function to update node demotion
order is called in CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN during CPU online/offline.  This
doesn't satisfy the order requirement.

For example, there are 4 CPUs (P0, P1, P2, P3) in 2 sockets (P0, P1 in S0
and P2, P3 in S1), the demotion order is

 - S0 -> NUMA_NO_NODE
 - S1 -> NUMA_NO_NODE

After P2 and P3 is offlined, because S1 has no CPU now, the demotion
order should have been changed to

 - S0 -> S1
 - S1 -> NO_NODE

but it isn't changed, because the order updating callback for CPU
hotplug doesn't see the new nodemask.  After that, if P1 is offlined,
the demotion order is changed to the expected order as above.

So in this patch, we added CPUHP_AP_MM_DEMOTION_ONLINE and
CPUHP_MM_DEMOTION_DEAD to be called after CPUHP_AP_ONLINE_DYN and
CPUHP_MM_VMSTAT_DEAD during CPU online and offline, and register the
update function on them.
