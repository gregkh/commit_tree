powerpc/64/interrupt: Reconcile soft-mask state in NMI and fix false BUG

If a NMI hits early in an interrupt handler before the irq soft-mask
state is reconciled, that can cause a false-positive BUG with a
CONFIG_PPC_IRQ_SOFT_MASK_DEBUG assertion.

Remove that assertion and instead check the case that if regs->msr has
EE clear, then regs->softe should be marked as disabled so the irq state
looks correct to NMI handlers, the same as how it's fixed up in the
case it was implicit soft-masked.

This doesn't fix a known problem -- the change that was fixed by commit
4ec5feec1ad02 ("powerpc/64s: Make NMI record implicitly soft-masked code
as irqs disabled") was the addition of a warning in the soft-nmi
watchdog interrupt which can never actually fire when MSR[EE]=0. However
it may be important if NMI handlers grow more code, and it's less
surprising to anything using 'regs' - (I tripped over this when working
in the area).
