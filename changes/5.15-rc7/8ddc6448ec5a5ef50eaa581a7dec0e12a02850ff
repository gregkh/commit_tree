powerpc/pseries: Consolidate different NUMA distance update code paths

The associativity details of the newly added resourced are collected from
the hypervisor via "ibm,configure-connector" rtas call. Update the numa
distance details of the newly added numa node after the above call.

Instead of updating NUMA distance every time we lookup a node id
from the associativity property, add helpers that can be used
during boot which does this only once. Also remove the distance
update from node id lookup helpers.

Currently, we duplicate parsing code for ibm,associativity and
ibm,associativity-lookup-arrays in the kernel. The associativity array provided
by these device tree properties are very similar and hence can use
a helper to parse the node id and numa distance details.
