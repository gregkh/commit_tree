iommu/io-pgtable: Remove non-strict quirk

IO_PGTABLE_QUIRK_NON_STRICT was never a very comfortable fit, since it's
not a quirk of the pagetable format itself. Now that we have a more
appropriate way to convey non-strict unmaps, though, this last of the
non-quirk quirks can also go, and with the flush queue code also now
enforcing its own ordering we can have a lovely cleanup all round.
