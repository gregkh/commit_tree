MIPS: ingenic: Unconditionally enable clock of CPU #0

Make sure that the PLL that feeds the CPU won't be stopped while the
kernel is running.

This fixes a problem on JZ4760 (and probably others) where under very
specific conditions, the main PLL would be turned OFF when the kernel
was shutting down, causing the shutdown process to fail.
