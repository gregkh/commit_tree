net/mlx5: Lag, move lag destruction to a workqueue

If a netdev is removed from the lag the lag should be destroyed.
With downstream patches this might trigger a reconfiguration of
representors on a different eswitch and such we don't have the proper
locking to so from this path. Move the destruction to be done by the
workqueue.

As the destruction won't affect the netdev side it okay to do so.
The RDMA side will be reconfigured and it already coded to handle such
reconfiguration.
