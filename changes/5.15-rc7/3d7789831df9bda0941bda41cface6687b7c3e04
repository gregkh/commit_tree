bpf: selftests: Add connect_to_fd_opts to network_helpers

The next test requires to setsockopt(TCP_CONGESTION) before
connect(), so a new arg is needed for the connect_to_fd() to specify
the cc's name.

This patch adds a new "struct network_helper_opts" for the future
option needs.  It starts with the "cc" and "timeout_ms" option.
A new helper connect_to_fd_opts() is added to take the new
"const struct network_helper_opts *opts" as an arg.
