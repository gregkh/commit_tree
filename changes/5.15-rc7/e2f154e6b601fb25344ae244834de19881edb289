net: ipa: introduce ipa_uc_clock()

The first time it's booted, the modem loads and starts the
IPA-resident microcontroller.  Once the microcontroller has
completed its initialization, it notifies the AP it's "ready"
by sending an INIT_COMPLETED response message.

Until it receives that microcontroller message, the AP must ensure
the IPA core clock remains operational.  Currently, a "proxy" clock
reference is taken in ipa_uc_config(), dropping it again once the
message is received.

However there could be a long delay between when ipa_config()
completes and when modem actually starts.  And because the
microcontroller gets loaded by the modem, there's no need to
get the modem "proxy clock" until the first time it starts.

Create a new function ipa_uc_clock() which takes the "proxy" clock
reference for the microcontroller.  Call it when we get remoteproc
SSR notification that the modem is about to start.  Keep an
additional flag to record whether this proxy clock reference needs
to be dropped at shutdown time, and issue a warning if we get the
microcontroller message either before the clock reference is taken,
or after it has already been dropped.

Drop the nearby use of "hh" length modifiers, which are no longer
encouraged in the kernel.
