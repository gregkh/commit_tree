ARM: imx: register reset controller from a platform driver

Starting with commit 6b2117ad65f1 ("of: property: fw_devlink: Add
support for "resets" and "pwms""), the imx-drm driver fails to load
due to forever dormant devlinks to the reset-controller node. This
node was never associated with a struct device.

Add a platform device to allow fw_devnode to activate the devlinks.
