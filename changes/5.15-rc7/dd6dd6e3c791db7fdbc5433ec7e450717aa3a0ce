ALSA: hda/realtek: Add quirk for TongFang PHxTxX1

This applies a SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) to the TongFang PHxTxX1 barebone. This
fixes the issue of the internal Microphone not working after booting
another OS.

When booting a certain another OS this barebone keeps some coeff settings
even after a cold shutdown. These coeffs prevent the microphone detection
from working in Linux, making the Laptop think that there is always an
external microphone plugged-in and therefore preventing the use of the
internal one.

The relevant indexes and values where gathered by naively diff-ing and
reading a working and a non-working coeff dump.
