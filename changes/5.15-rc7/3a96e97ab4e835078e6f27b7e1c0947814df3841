serial: 8250_pci: make setup_port() parameters explicitly unsigned

The bar and offset parameters to setup_port() are used in pointer math,
and while it would be very difficult to get them to wrap as a negative
number, just be "safe" and make them unsigned so that static checkers do
not trip over them unintentionally.
