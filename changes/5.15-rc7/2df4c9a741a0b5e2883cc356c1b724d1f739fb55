ARM: 9112/1: uaccess: add __{get,put}_kernel_nofault

These mimic the behavior of get_user and put_user, except
for domain switching, address limit checking and handling
of mismatched sizes, none of which are relevant here.

To work with pre-Armv6 kernels, this has to avoid TUSER()
inside of the new macros, the new approach passes the "t"
string along with the opcode, which is a bit uglier but
avoids duplicating more code.

As there is no __get_user_asm_dword(), I work around it
by copying 32 bit at a time, which is possible because
the output size is known.
