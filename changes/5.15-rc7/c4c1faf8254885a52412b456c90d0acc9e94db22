Revert "usb: host: fotg210: Use dma_pool_zalloc"

This reverts commit cb6a0db8fdc12433ed4281331de0c3923dc2807b for the
same reason as commit 43b78f1155c868208a413082179251f5fba78153 in the
ehci-hcd driver.

    What you can't see just from reading the patch is that in both
    cases (ehci->itd_pool and ehci->sitd_pool) there are two
    allocation paths -- the two branches of an "if" statement -- and
    only one of the paths calls dma_pool_[z]alloc.  However, the
    memset is needed for both paths, and so it can't be eliminated.
    Given that it must be present, there's no advantage to calling
    dma_pool_zalloc rather than dma_pool_alloc.
