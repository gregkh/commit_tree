drm/i915/dpcd_bl: Handle drm_dpcd_read/write() return values correctly

This is kind of an annoying aspect of DRM's DP helpers:
drm_dp_dpcd_readb/writeb() return the size of bytes read/written on
success, thus we want to check against that instead of checking if the
return value is less than 0.

I'll probably be fixing this in the near future once I start doing DP work
again, also because I'd rather not mix a tree-wide refactor like that in
with a patch series intended to be around introducing DP backlight helpers.
So, for now let's just handle the return values from each function
correctly.
