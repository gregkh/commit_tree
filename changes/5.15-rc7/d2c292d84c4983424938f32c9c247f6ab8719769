xfs: Convert double locking of MMAPLOCK to use VFS helpers

Convert places in XFS that take MMAPLOCK for two inodes to use helper
VFS provides for it (filemap_invalidate_down_write_two()). Note that
this changes lock ordering for MMAPLOCK from inode number based ordering
to pointer based ordering VFS generally uses.
