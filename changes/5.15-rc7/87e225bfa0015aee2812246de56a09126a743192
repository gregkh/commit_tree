s390/qdio: fine-tune the queue sync

Push the sync check from qdio_inspect_queue() down into the two
get_*_buffer_frontier() code paths, where we actually need the sync to
look at the current queue state. This lets us avoid the check when we
know that there is no work on the queue (ie. when q->nr_buf_used is 0).

While at it introduce the qdio_sync_*_queue() helpers, so that we can
avoid the branch on q->is_input_q when we already know the queue type.
