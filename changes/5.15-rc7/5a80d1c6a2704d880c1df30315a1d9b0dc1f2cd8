btrfs: zoned: remove max_zone_append_size logic

There used to be a patch in the original series for zoned support which
limited the extent size to max_zone_append_size, but this patch has been
dropped somewhere around v9.

We've decided to go the opposite direction, instead of limiting extents
in the first place we split them before submission to comply with the
device's limits.

Remove the related code, btrfs_fs_info::max_zone_append_size and
btrfs_zoned_device_info::max_zone_append_size.

This also removes the workaround for dm-crypt introduced in
1d68128c107a ("btrfs: zoned: fail mount if the device does not support
zone append") because the fix has been merged as f34ee1dce642 ("dm
crypt: Fix zoned block device support").
