net: ipa: fix IPA v4.11 interconnect data

Currently three interconnects are defined for the Qualcomm SC7280
SoC, but this was based on a misunderstanding.  There should only be
two interconnects defined:  one between the IPA and system memory;
and another between the AP and IPA config space.  The bandwidths
defined for the memory and config interconnects do not match what I
understand to be proper values, so update these.
