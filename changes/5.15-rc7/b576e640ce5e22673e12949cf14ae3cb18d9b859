locking/rtmutex: Provide rt_wake_q_head and helpers

To handle the difference between wakeups for regular sleeping locks (mutex,
rtmutex, rw_semaphore) and the wakeups for 'sleeping' spin/rwlocks on
PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels correctly, it is required to provide a
wake_q_head construct which allows to keep them separate.

Provide a wrapper around wake_q_head and the required helpers, which will be
extended with the state handling later.

No functional change.
