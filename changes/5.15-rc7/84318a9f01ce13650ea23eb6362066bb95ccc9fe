scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Add send, receive, and accept for auth_els

Some FC adapters from Marvell offer the ability to encrypt data in flight
(EDIF). This feature requires an application to act as an authenticator.

Add the ability for authentication application to send and retrieve
messages as part of the authentication process via existing
FC_BSG_HST_ELS_NOLOGIN BSG interface.

To send a message, application is expected to format the data in the AUTH
ELS format. Refer to FC-SP2 for details.

If a message was received, application is required to reply with either a
LS_ACC or LS_RJT complete the exchange using the same interface. Otherwise,
remote device will treat it as a timeout.
