perf config: Fix caching and memory leak in perf_home_perfconfig()

Acaict, perf_home_perfconfig() is supposed to cache the result of
home_perfconfig, which returns the default location of perfconfig for
the user, given the HOME environment variable.

However, the current implementation calls home_perfconfig every time
perf_home_perfconfig() is called (so no caching is actually performed),
replacing the previous pointer, thus also causing a memory leak.

This patch adds a check of whether either config or failed is set and,
in that case, directly returns config without calling home_perfconfig at
each invocation.
