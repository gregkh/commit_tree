samples: bpf: Fix vmlinux.h generation for XDP samples

Generate vmlinux.h only from the in-tree vmlinux, and remove enum
declarations that would cause a build failure in case of version
mismatches.

There are now two options when building the samples:
1. Compile the kernel to use in-tree vmlinux for vmlinux.h
2. Override VMLINUX_BTF for samples using something like this:
   make VMLINUX_BTF=/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux -C samples/bpf

This change was tested with relative builds, e.g. cases like:
 * make O=build -C samples/bpf
 * make KBUILD_OUTPUT=build -C samples/bpf
 * make -C samples/bpf
 * cd samples/bpf && make

When a suitable VMLINUX_BTF is not found, the following message is
printed:
/home/kkd/src/linux/samples/bpf/Makefile:333: *** Cannot find a vmlinux
for VMLINUX_BTF at any of "  ./vmlinux", build the kernel or set
VMLINUX_BTF variable.  Stop.
