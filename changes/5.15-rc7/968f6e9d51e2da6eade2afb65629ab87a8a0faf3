ARM: dts: at91: sama7g5ek: use proper slew-rate settings for GMACs

Datasheet chapter "EMAC Timings" specifies that while in 3.3V domain
GMAC's MDIO pins should be configured with slew-rate enabled, while the
data + signaling pins should be configured with slew-rate disabled when
GMAC works in RGMII or RMII modes. The pin controller for SAMA7G5 sets
the slew-rate as enabled for all pins. Adapt the device tree to comply
with these.
