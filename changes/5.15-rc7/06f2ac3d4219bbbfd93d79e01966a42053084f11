x86/sev: Return an error on a returned non-zero SW_EXITINFO1[31:0]

After returning from a VMGEXIT NAE event, SW_EXITINFO1[31:0] is checked
for a value of 1, which indicates an error and that SW_EXITINFO2
contains exception information. However, future versions of the GHCB
specification may define new values for SW_EXITINFO1[31:0], so really
any non-zero value should be treated as an error.
