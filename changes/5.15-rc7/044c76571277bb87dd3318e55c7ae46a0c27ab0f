ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add support for a second headphones output

Some devices (HP Elitepad 1000 G2) have a second headphones output
(1 on the dock, 2nd on the tablet itself) which is implemented through
the line-out output of the codec combined with an external hp-amp
which gets enabled through the codec's GPIO1 pin.

Add support for this through a new BYT_RT5640_LINEOUT_AS_HP2 quirk,
note users are expected to use this combined with the
BYT_RT5640_LINEOUT quirk. If that quirk is not set the new quirk is
ignored.
