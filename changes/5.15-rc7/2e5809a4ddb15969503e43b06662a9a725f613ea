arm64/hugetlb: fix CMA gigantic page order for non-4K PAGE_SIZE

For non-4K PAGE_SIZE configs, the largest gigantic huge page size is
CONT_PMD_SHIFT order. On arm64 with 64K PAGE_SIZE, the gigantic page is
16G. Therefore, one should be able to specify 'hugetlb_cma=16G' on the
kernel command line so that one gigantic page can be allocated from CMA.
However, when adding such an option the following message is produced:

hugetlb_cma: cma area should be at least 8796093022208 MiB

This is because the calculation for non-4K gigantic page order is
incorrect in the arm64 specific routine arm64_hugetlb_cma_reserve().
