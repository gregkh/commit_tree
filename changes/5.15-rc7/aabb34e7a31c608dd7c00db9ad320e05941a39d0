btrfs: relax restrictions for SNAP_DESTROY_V2 with subvolids

So far we prevented the deletion of subvolumes and snapshots using
subvolume ids possible with the BTRFS_SUBVOL_SPEC_BY_ID flag.

This restriction is necessary on idmapped mounts as this allows
filesystem wide subvolume and snapshot deletions and thus can escape the
scope of what's exposed under the mount identified by the fd passed with
the ioctl.

Deletion by subvolume id works by looking for an alias of the parent of
the subvolume or snapshot to be deleted. The parent alias can be
anywhere in the filesystem. However, as long as the alias of the parent
that is found is the same as the one identified by the file descriptor
passed through the ioctl we can allow the deletion.
