f2fs: Revert "f2fs: Fix indefinite loop in f2fs_gc() v1"

This reverts commit 957fa47823dfe449c5a15a944e4e7a299a6601db.

The patch "f2fs: Fix indefinite loop in f2fs_gc()" v1 and v4 are all
merged. Patch v4 is test info for patch v1. Patch v1 doesn't work and
may cause that sbi->cur_victim_sec can't be resetted to NULL_SEGNO,
which makes SSR unable to get segment of sbi->cur_victim_sec.
So it should be reverted.
