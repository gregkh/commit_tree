usb: core: hcd: Add support for deferring roothub registration

It has been observed with certain PCIe USB cards (like Inateck connected
to AM64 EVM or J7200 EVM) that as soon as the primary roothub is
registered, port status change is handled even before xHC is running
leading to cold plug USB devices not detected. For such cases, registering
both the root hubs along with the second HCD is required. Add support for
deferring roothub registration in usb_add_hcd(), so that both primary and
secondary roothubs are registered along with the second HCD.
