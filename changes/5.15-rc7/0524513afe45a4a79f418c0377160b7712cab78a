tty: don't store semi-state into tty drivers

When a tty driver pointer is used as a return value of struct
console's device() hook, don't store a semi-state into global variable
which holds the tty driver. It could mean console::device() would return
a bogus value. This is important esp. after the next patch where we
switch from alloc_tty_driver to tty_alloc_driver. tty_alloc_driver
returns ERR_PTR in case of error and that might have unexpected results
as the code doesn't expect this.
