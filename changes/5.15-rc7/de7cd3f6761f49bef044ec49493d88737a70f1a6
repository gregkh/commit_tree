KVM: x86: check for interrupts before deciding whether to exit the fast path

The kvm_x86_sync_pir_to_irr callback can sometimes set KVM_REQ_EVENT.
If that happens exactly at the time that an exit is handled as
EXIT_FASTPATH_REENTER_GUEST, vcpu_enter_guest will go incorrectly
through the loop that calls kvm_x86_run, instead of processing
the request promptly.
