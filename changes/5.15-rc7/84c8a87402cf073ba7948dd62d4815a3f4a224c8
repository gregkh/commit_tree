net/mlx5e: Fix division by 0 in mlx5e_select_queue for representors

Commit 846d6da1fcdb ("net/mlx5e: Fix division by 0 in
mlx5e_select_queue") makes mlx5e_build_nic_params assign a non-zero
initial value to priv->num_tc_x_num_ch, so that mlx5e_select_queue
doesn't fail with division by 0 if called before the first activation of
channels. However, the initialization flow of representors doesn't call
mlx5e_build_nic_params, so this bug can still happen with representors.

This commit fixes the bug by adding the missing assignment to
mlx5e_build_rep_params.
