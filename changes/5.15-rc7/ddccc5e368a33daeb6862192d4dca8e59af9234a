net: hns3: add support for triggering reset by ethtool

Currently, four reset types are supported for the HNS3 ethernet
driver: IMP reset, global reset, function reset, and FLR. Only
FLR can now be triggered by the user. To restore the device when
an exception occurs, add support for triggering reset by ethtool.

Run the "ethtool --reset DEVNAME mgmt | all | dedicated" to
trigger the IMP | global | function reset manually.

In addition, VF can only trigger function reset.
