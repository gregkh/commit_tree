tools headers UAPI: Sync x86's asm/kvm.h with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  61e5f69ef08379cd ("KVM: x86: implement KVM_GUESTDBG_BLOCKIRQ")

That just rebuilds kvm-stat.c on x86, no change in functionality.

This silences these perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/kvm.h
