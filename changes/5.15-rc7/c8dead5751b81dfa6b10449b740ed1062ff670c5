drm/i915/dp: Use max params for panels < eDP 1.4

Users reported that after commit 2bbd6dba84d4 ("drm/i915: Try to use
fast+narrow link on eDP again and fall back to the old max strategy on
failure"), the screen starts to have wobbly effect.

Commit a5c936add6a2 ("drm/i915/dp: Use slow and wide link training for
everything") doesn't help either, that means the affected eDP 1.2 panels
only work with max params.

So use max params for panels < eDP 1.4 as Windows does to solve the
issue.

v3:
 - Do the eDP rev check in intel_edp_init_dpcd()

v2:
 - Check eDP 1.4 instead of DPCD 1.1 to apply max params
