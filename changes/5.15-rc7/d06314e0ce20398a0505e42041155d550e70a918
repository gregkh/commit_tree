s390/qdio: improve roll-back after error on ESTABLISH ccw

If the ESTABLISH ccw fails (ie. the qdio_irq is set to
QDIO_IRQ_STATE_ERR), we don't need to call qdio_shutdown() for rolling
back our earlier actions. All the needed logic is already available in
qdio_establish()'s error chain, and using it means we don't have to
temporarily drop the setup_mutex either.

This makes qdio_shutdown() a purely external function, that should only
be called by the driver if an earlier qdio_establish() succeeded.
