rcu-tasks: Add comments explaining task_struct strategy

Accesses to task_struct structures must be either protected by RCU
or by get_task_struct().  Tasks trace RCU uses these in a non-obvious
combination, in conjunction with an IPI handler.  This commit therefore
adds comments explaining this usage.
