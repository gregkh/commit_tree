SUNRPC keep track of number of transports to unique addresses

Currently, xprt_switch keeps a number of all xprts (xps_nxprts)
that were added to the switch regardless of whethere it's an
nconnect transport or a transport to a trunkable address.
Introduce a new counter to keep track of transports to unique
destination addresses per xprt_switch.
