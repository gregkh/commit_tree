dpaa2-switch: add VLAN based mirroring

Using the infrastructure added in the previous patch, extend tc-flower
support with FLOW_ACTION_MIRRED based on VLAN.

tc qdisc add dev eth8 ingress_block 1 clsact
tc filter add block 1 ingress protocol 802.1q flower skip_sw \
	vlan_id 100 action mirred egress mirror dev eth6
tc filter del block 1 ingress pref 49152
