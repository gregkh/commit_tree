NFSv4.1 add network transport when session trunking is detected

After trunking is discovered in nfs4_discover_server_trunking(),
add the transport to the old client structure if the allowed limit
of transports has not been reached.

An example: there exists a multi-homed server and client mounts
one server address and some volume and then doest another mount to
a different address of the same server and perhaps a different
volume. Previously, the client checks that this is a session
trunkable servers (same server), and removes the newly created
client structure along with its transport. Now, the client
adds the connection from the 2nd mount into the xprt switch of
the existing client (it leads to having 2 available connections).
