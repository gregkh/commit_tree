drm/msm: Fix devfreq NULL pointer dereference on a3xx

There is no devfreq on a3xx at the moment since gpu_busy is not
implemented. This means that msm_devfreq_init() will return early
and the entire devfreq setup is skipped.

However, msm_devfreq_active() and msm_devfreq_idle() are still called
unconditionally later, causing a NULL pointer dereference:

  Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 0000000000000010
  Internal error: Oops: 96000004 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
  CPU: 0 PID: 133 Comm: ring0 Not tainted 5.15.0-rc1 #4
  Hardware name: Longcheer L8150 (DT)
  pc : mutex_lock_io+0x2bc/0x2f0
  lr : msm_devfreq_active+0x3c/0xe0 [msm]
  Call trace:

   drm_sched_main+0x2b0/0x4a0 [gpu_sched]
   kthread+0x154/0x160
   ret_from_fork+0x10/0x20

Fix this by adding a check in msm_devfreq_active/idle() which ensures
that devfreq was actually initialized earlier.
