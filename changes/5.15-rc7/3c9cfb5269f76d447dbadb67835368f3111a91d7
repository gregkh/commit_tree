net: update NXP copyright text

NXP Legal insists that the following are not fine:

- Saying "NXP Semiconductors" instead of "NXP", since the company's
  registered name is "NXP"

- Putting a "(c)" sign in the copyright string

- Putting a comma in the copyright string

The only accepted copyright string format is "Copyright <year-range> NXP".

This patch changes the copyright headers in the networking files that
were sent by me, or derived from code sent by me.
