ftrace: Introduce ftrace_need_init_nop()

Implementing live patching on s390 requires each function's prologue to
contain a very special kind of nop, which gcc and clang don't generate.
However, the current code assumes that if CC_USING_NOP_MCOUNT is
defined, then whatever the compiler generates is good enough.

Move the CC_USING_NOP_MCOUNT check into the new ftrace_need_init_nop()
macro, that the architectures can override.

An alternative solution is to disable using -mnop-mcount in the
Makefile, however, this makes the build logic (even) more complicated
and forces the arch-specific code to deal with the useless __fentry__
symbol.
