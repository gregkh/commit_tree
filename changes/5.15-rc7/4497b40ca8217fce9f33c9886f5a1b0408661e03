Revert "ARM: imx6q: drop of_platform_default_populate() from init_machine"

This reverts commit cc8870bf4c3ab0af385538460500a9d342ed945f.

Since commit cc8870bf4c3a ("ARM: imx6q: drop of_platform_default_populate()
from init_machine") the following errors are seen on boot:

[    0.123372] imx6q_suspend_init: failed to find ocram device!
[    0.123537] imx6_pm_common_init: No DDR LPM support with suspend -19!

, which break suspend/resume on imx6q/dl.

Revert the offeding commit to avoid the regression.

Thanks to Tim Harvey for bisecting this problem.
