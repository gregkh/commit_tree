clocksource/drivers/exynos_mct: Prioritise Arm arch timer on arm64

All arm64 CPUs feature an architected timer, which offers a relatively
low-latency interface to a per-cpu clocksource and timer. For the most
part, using this interface is a no-brainer, with the exception of SoCs
where it cannot be used to wake up from deep idle state (i.e.
CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_C3STOP is set).

On the contrary, the Exynos MCT is extremely slow to access yet can be
used as a wakeup source. In preparation for using the Exynos MCT as a
potential wakeup timer for the Arm architected timer, reduce its ratings
so that the architected timer is preferred.

This effectively reverts the decision made in 6282edb72bed
("clocksource/drivers/exynos_mct: Increase priority over ARM arch timer")
for arm64, as the reasoning for the original change was to work around
a 32-bit SoC design.
