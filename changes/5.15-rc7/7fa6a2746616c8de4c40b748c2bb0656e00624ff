x86/build: Do not add -falign flags unconditionally for clang

clang does not support -falign-jumps and only recently gained support
for -falign-loops. When one of the configuration options that adds these
flags is enabled, clang warns and all cc-{disable-warning,option} that
follow fail because -Werror gets added to test for the presence of this
warning:

clang-14: warning: optimization flag '-falign-jumps=0' is not supported
[-Wignored-optimization-argument]

To resolve this, add a couple of cc-option calls when building with
clang; gcc has supported these options since 3.2 so there is no point in
testing for their support. -falign-functions was implemented in clang-7,
-falign-loops was implemented in clang-14, and -falign-jumps has not
been implemented yet.
