bonding: add new option lacp_active

Add an option lacp_active, which is similar with team's runner.active.
This option specifies whether to send LACPDU frames periodically. If set
on, the LACPDU frames are sent along with the configured lacp_rate
setting. If set off, the LACPDU frames acts as "speak when spoken to".

Note, the LACPDU state frames still will be sent when init or unbind port.

v2: remove module parameter
