drm/i915: Enable -Wsometimes-uninitialized

This warning helps catch uninitialized variables. It should have been
enabled at the same time as commit b2423184ac33 ("drm/i915: Enable
-Wuninitialized") but I did not realize they were disabled separately.
Enable it now that i915 is clean so that it stays that way.
