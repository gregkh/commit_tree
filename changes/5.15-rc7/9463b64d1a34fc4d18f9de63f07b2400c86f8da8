drm/msm/dp: only signal audio when disconnected detected at dp_pm_resume

Currently there is audio not working problem after system resume from suspend
if hdmi monitor stay plugged in at DUT. However this problem does not happen
at normal operation but at a particular test case. The root cause is DP driver
signal audio with connected state at resume which trigger audio trying to setup
audio data path through DP main link but failed due to display port is not setup
and enabled by upper layer framework yet. This patch only have DP driver signal
audio only when DP is in disconnected state so that audio option shows correct
state after system resume. DP driver will not signal audio with connected state
until display enabled executed by upper layer framework where display port is
setup completed and main link is running.
