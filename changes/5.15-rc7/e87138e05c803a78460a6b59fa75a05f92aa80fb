drm/gma500/oaktrail_lvds: replace continue with break

Currently a loop scans through the connector list checking
for connectors that do not match a specific criteria. The
use of the continue statement is a little unintuitive and
can confuse static analysis checking.  Invert the criteria
matching logic and use a break to terminate the loop once
the first suitable connector has been found.

Thanks to Patrik Jakobsson for explaining the original
intent of the code and suggesting this change.
