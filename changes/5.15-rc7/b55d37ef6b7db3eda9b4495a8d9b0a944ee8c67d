usb-storage: Add quirk for ScanLogic SL11R-IDE older than 2.6c

ScanLogic SL11R-IDE with firmware older than 2.6c (the latest one) has
broken tag handling, preventing the device from working at all:
usb 1-1: new full-speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd
usb 1-1: New USB device found, idVendor=04ce, idProduct=0002, bcdDevice= 2.60
usb 1-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=1, SerialNumber=0
usb 1-1: Product: USB Device
usb 1-1: Manufacturer: USB Device
usb-storage 1-1:1.0: USB Mass Storage device detected
scsi host2: usb-storage 1-1:1.0
usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage
usb 1-1: reset full-speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd
usb 1-1: reset full-speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd
usb 1-1: reset full-speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd
usb 1-1: reset full-speed USB device number 2 using uhci_hcd

Add US_FL_BULK_IGNORE_TAG to fix it. Also update my e-mail address.

2.6c is the only firmware that claims Linux compatibility.
The firmware can be upgraded using ezotgdbg utility:
