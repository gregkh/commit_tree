PCI: Restrict ASMedia ASM1062 SATA Max Payload Size Supported

The ASMedia ASM1062 SATA controller advertises Max_Payload_Size_Supported
of 512, but in fact it cannot handle incoming TLPs with payload size of
512.

We discovered this issue on PCIe controllers capable of MPS = 512 (Aardvark
and DesignWare), where the issue presents itself as an External Abort.
Bjorn Helgaas says:

  Probably ASM1062 reports a Malformed TLP error when it receives a data
  payload of 512 bytes, and Aardvark, DesignWare, etc convert this to an
  arm64 External Abort. [1]

To avoid this problem, limit the ASM1062 Max Payload Size Supported to 256
bytes, so we set the Max Payload Size of devices that may send TLPs to the
ASM1062 to 256 or less.
