selftests: nettest: Add --{force,no}-bind-key-ifindex

These options allow explicit control over the TCP_MD5SIG_FLAG_IFINDEX
flag instead of always setting it based on binding to an interface.

Do this by converting to getopt_long because nettest has too many
single-character flags already and getopt_long is widely used in
selftests.
