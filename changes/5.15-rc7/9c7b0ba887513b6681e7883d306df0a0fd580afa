io_uring: auto-removal for direct open/accept

It might be inconvenient that direct open/accept deviates from the
update semantics and fails if the slot is taken instead of removing a
file sitting there. Implement this auto-removal.

Note that removal might need to allocate and so may fail. However, if an
empty slot is specified, it's guaraneed to not fail on the fd
installation side for valid userspace programs. It's needed for users
who can't tolerate such failures, e.g. accept where the other end
never retries.
