scsi: ufs: ufs-pci: Force a full restore after suspend-to-disk

Implement the ->restore() PM operation and set the link to off, which will
force a full reset and restore.  This ensures that Host Performance Booster
is reset after suspend-to-disk.

The Host Performance Booster feature caches logical-to-physical mapping
information in the host memory.  After suspend-to-disk, such information is
not valid, so a full reset and restore is needed.

A full reset and restore is done if the SPM level is 5 or 6, but not for
other SPM levels, so this change fixes those cases.

A full reset and restore also restores base address registers, so that code
is removed.
