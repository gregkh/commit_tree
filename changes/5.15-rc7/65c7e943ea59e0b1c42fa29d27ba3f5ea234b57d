drm/amd/display: Use DCN30 watermark calc for DCN301

[why]
dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dl() causes flickering when external monitor is
connected.

This issue has been fixed before by commit 0e4c0ae59d7e
("drm/amdgpu/display: drop dcn301_calculate_wm_and_dl for now"), however
part of the fix was gone after commit 2cbcb78c9ee5 ("Merge tag 'amd-drm-next-5.13-2021-03-23' of https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/agd5f/linux into drm-next").

[how]
Use dcn30_calculate_wm_and_dlg() instead as in the original fix.

Fixes: 2cbcb78c9ee5 ("Merge tag 'amd-drm-next-5.13-2021-03-23' of https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/agd5f/linux into drm-next")
