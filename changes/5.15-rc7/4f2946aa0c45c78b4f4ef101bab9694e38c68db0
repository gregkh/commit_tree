IMA: introduce a new policy option func=SETXATTR_CHECK

While users can restrict the accepted hash algorithms for the
security.ima xattr file signature when appraising said file, users
cannot restrict the algorithms that can be set on that attribute:
any algorithm built in the kernel is accepted on a write.

Define a new value for the ima policy option 'func' that restricts
globally the hash algorithms accepted when writing the security.ima
xattr.

When a policy contains a rule of the form
	appraise func=SETXATTR_CHECK appraise_algos=sha256,sha384,sha512
only values corresponding to one of these three digest algorithms
will be accepted for writing the security.ima xattr.  Attempting to
write the attribute using another algorithm (or "free-form" data)
will be denied with an audit log message.  In the absence of such a
policy rule, the default is still to only accept hash algorithms
built in the kernel (with all the limitations that entails).
