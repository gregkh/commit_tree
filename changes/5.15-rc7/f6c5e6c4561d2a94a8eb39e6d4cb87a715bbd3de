scsi: lpfc: Revise Topology and RAS support checks for new adapters

Support for Topology and RAS logging capabilities were qualified by PCIe
device ID checks necessitating additional driver changes for new device
IDs.

Reduce reliance on specific PCIe device IDs by substituting checks for SLI
family information. This automatically picks up support on the newest
hardware.
