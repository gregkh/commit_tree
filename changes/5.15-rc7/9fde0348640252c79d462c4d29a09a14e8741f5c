m68k: Remove set_fs()

Add a m68k-only set_fc helper to set the SFC and DFC registers for the
few places that need to override it for special MM operations, but
disconnect that from the deprecated kernel-wide set_fs() API.

Note that the SFC/DFC registers are context switched, so there is no need
to disable preemption.

Partially based on an earlier patch from
Linus Torvalds <torvalds@linux-foundation.org>.
