tcp: md5: Allow MD5SIG_FLAG_IFINDEX with ifindex=0

Multiple VRFs are generally meant to be "separate" but right now md5
keys for the default VRF also affect connections inside VRFs if the IP
addresses happen to overlap.

So far the combination of TCP_MD5SIG_FLAG_IFINDEX with tcpm_ifindex == 0
was an error, accept this to mean "key only applies to default VRF".
This is what applications using VRFs for traffic separation want.
