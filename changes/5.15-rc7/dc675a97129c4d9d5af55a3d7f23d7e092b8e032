f2fs: fix min_seq_blocks can not make sense in some scenes.

F2FS have dirty page count control for batched sequential
write in writepages, and get the value of min_seq_blocks by
blocks_per_seg * segs_per_sec(segs_per_sec defaults to 1).
But in some scenes we set a lager section size, Min_seq_blocks
will become too large to achieve the expected effect(eg. 4thread
sequential write, the number of merge requests will be reduced).
