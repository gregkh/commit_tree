fs: add generic helper for filling statx attribute flags

The immutable and append-only properties on an inode are published on
the inode's i_flags and enforced by the VFS.

Create a helper to fill the corresponding STATX_ATTR_ flags in the kstat
structure from the inode's i_flags.

Only orange was converted to use this helper.
Other filesystems could use it in the future.
