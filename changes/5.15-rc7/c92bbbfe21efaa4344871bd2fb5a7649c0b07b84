vt: keyboard: treat kbd_table as an array all the time.

The keyboard.c code seems to like to treat the kbd_table as both an
array, and as a base to do some pointer math off of.  As they really are
the same thing, and compilers are smart enough not to make a difference
anymore, just be explicit and always use this as an array to make the
code more obvious for all to read.
