staging: r8188eu: Remove some bit manipulation macros

This driver defines a set of macros that get or set a bitfield in the
RX and TX descriptors. Most of these have been replaced by the appropriate
use of the system macros BIT() or GENMASK().

While reworking these routines, I also fixed camel case variables and
missing spaces. Some comments were also converted to the
drivers/net/wireless preferred format.
