signal: Verify the alignment and size of siginfo_t

Update the static assertions about siginfo_t to also describe
it's alignment and size.

While investigating if it was possible to add a 64bit field into
siginfo_t[1] it became apparent that the alignment of siginfo_t
is as much a part of the ABI as the size of the structure.

If the alignment changes siginfo_t when embedded in another structure
can move to a different offset.  Which is not acceptable from an ABI
structure.

So document that fact and add static assertions to notify developers
if they change change the alignment by accident.
