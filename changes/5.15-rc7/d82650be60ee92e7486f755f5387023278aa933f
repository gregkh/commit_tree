net: hns3: don't rollback when destroy mqprio fail

For destroy mqprio is irreversible in stack, so it's unnecessary
to rollback the tc configuration when destroy mqprio failed.
Otherwise, it may cause the configuration being inconsistent
between driver and netstack.

As the failure is usually caused by reset, and the driver will
restore the configuration after reset, so it can keep the
configuration being consistent between driver and hardware.
