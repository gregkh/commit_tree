nvme: avoid race in shutdown namespace removal

When we remove the siblings entry, we update ns->head->list, hence we
can't separate the removal and test for being empty. They have to be
in the same critical section to avoid a race.

To avoid breaking the refcounting imbalance again, add a list empty
check to nvme_find_ns_head.
