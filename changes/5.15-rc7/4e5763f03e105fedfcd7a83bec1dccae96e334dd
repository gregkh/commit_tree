drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Wrap panel with panel-bridge

To simplify interfacing with the panel, wrap it in a panel-bridge and
let the DRM bridge helpers handle chaining of operations.

This also prepares for support of DRM_BRIDGE_ATTACH_NO_CONNECTOR, which
requires all components in the display pipeline to be represented by
bridges.
