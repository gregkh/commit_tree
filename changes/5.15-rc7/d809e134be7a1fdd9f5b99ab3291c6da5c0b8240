bpf: Prepare bpf_prog_put() to be called from irq context.

Currently bpf_prog_put() is called from the task context only.
With addition of bpf timers the timer related helpers will start calling
bpf_prog_put() from irq-saved region and in rare cases might drop
the refcnt to zero.
To address this case, first, convert bpf_prog_free_id() to be irq-save
(this is similar to bpf_map_free_id), and, second, defer non irq
appropriate calls into work queue.
For example:
bpf_audit_prog() is calling kmalloc and wake_up_interruptible,
bpf_prog_kallsyms_del_all()->bpf_ksym_del()->spin_unlock_bh().
They are not safe with irqs disabled.
