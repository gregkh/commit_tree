brd: reduce the brd_devices_mutex scope

As with commit 8b52d8be86d72308 ("loop: reorder loop_exit"),
unregister_blkdev() needs to be called first in order to avoid calling
brd_alloc() from brd_probe() after brd_del_one() from brd_exit(). Then,
we can avoid holding global mutex during add_disk()/del_gendisk() as with
commit 1c500ad706383f1a ("loop: reduce the loop_ctl_mutex scope").
