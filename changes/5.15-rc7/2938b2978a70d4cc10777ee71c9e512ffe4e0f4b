hwmon: (tmp421) handle I2C errors

Function i2c_smbus_read_byte_data() can return a negative error number
instead of the data read if I2C transaction failed for whatever reason.

Lack of error checking can lead to serious issues on production
hardware, e.g. errors treated as temperatures produce spurious critical
temperature-crossed-threshold errors in BMC logs for OCP server
hardware. The patch was tested with Mellanox OCP Mezzanine card
emulating TMP421 protocol for temperature sensing which sometimes leads
to I2C protocol error during early boot up stage.
