counter: 104-quad-8: Return error when invalid mode during ceiling_write

The 104-QUAD-8 only has two count modes where a ceiling value makes
sense: Range Limit and Modulo-N. Outside of these two modes, setting a
ceiling value is an invalid operation -- so let's report it as such by
returning -EINVAL.
