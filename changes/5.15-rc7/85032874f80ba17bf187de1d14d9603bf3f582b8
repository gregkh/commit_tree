nvme-rdma: don't update queue count when failing to set io queues

We update ctrl->queue_count and schedule another reconnect when io queue
count is zero.But we will never try to create any io queue in next reco-
nnection, because ctrl->queue_count already set to zero.We will end up
having an admin-only session in Live state, which is exactly what we try
to avoid in the original patch.
Update ctrl->queue_count after queue_count zero checking to fix it.
