ALSA: sc6000: Assign vport directly on card's private_data

sc6000 driver tries to allocate an extra pointer for keeping the vport
address and point it over card->private_data.  But, this indirect
access is utterly superfluous, and we can keep the vport address
directly in card->private_data instead.  This will simply the code and
avoid confusion.
