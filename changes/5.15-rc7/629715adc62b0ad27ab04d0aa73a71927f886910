ucounts: Pair inc_rlimit_ucounts with dec_rlimit_ucoutns in commit_creds

The purpose of inc_rlimit_ucounts and dec_rlimit_ucounts in commit_creds
is to change which rlimit counter is used to track a process when the
credentials changes.

Use the same test for both to guarantee the tracking is correct.
