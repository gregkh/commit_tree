net: hns3: change affinity_mask to numa node range

Currently, affinity_mask is set to a single cpu. As a result,
irqbalance becomes invalid in SUBSET or EXACT mode. To solve
this problem, change affinity_mask to numa node range. In this
way, irqbalance can be performed on the cpu of the numa node.
