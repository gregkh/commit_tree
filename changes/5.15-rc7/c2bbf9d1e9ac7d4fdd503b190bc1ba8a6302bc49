dma-debug: teach add_dma_entry() about DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC

Mapping something twice should be possible as long as,
DMA_ATTR_SKIP_CPU_SYNC is passed to the strictly speaking second relevant
mapping operation (that attempts to map the same thing). So, don't issue a
warning if the specified condition is met in add_dma_entry().
