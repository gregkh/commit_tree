ALSA: usb-audio: Fix microphone sound on Jieli webcam.

When a Jieli Technology USB Webcam is connected, the video part works
well, but the mic sound is speeded up. On dmesg there are messages
about different rates from the runtime rates, warnings about volume
resolution and lastly, the log is filled, every 5 seconds, with
retire_capture_urb error messages.

The mic works only when ep packet size is set to wMaxPacketSize (normal
sound and no more retire_capture_urb error messages). Skipping reading
sample rate, fixes the messages about different rates and forcing a volume
resolution, fixes warnings about volume range. I have arbitrarily choosed
the value (16): I read in a comment that there should be no more than 255
levels, so 4096 (max volume) / 16 = 0-255.
