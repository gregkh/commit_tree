NIOS2: setup.c: drop unused variable 'dram_start'

This is a nuisance when CONFIG_WERROR is set, so drop the variable
declaration since the code that used it was removed.

../arch/nios2/kernel/setup.c: In function 'setup_arch':
../arch/nios2/kernel/setup.c:152:13: warning: unused variable 'dram_start' [-Wunused-variable]
  152 |         int dram_start;
