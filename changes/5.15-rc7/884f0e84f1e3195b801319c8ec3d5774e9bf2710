blk-throttle: fix UAF by deleteing timer in blk_throtl_exit()

The pending timer has been set up in blk_throtl_init(). However, the
timer is not deleted in blk_throtl_exit(). This means that the timer
handler may still be running after freeing the timer, which would
result in a use-after-free.

Fix by calling del_timer_sync() to delete the timer in blk_throtl_exit().
