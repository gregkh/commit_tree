usb: dwc2: gadget: Fix ISOC transfer complete handling for DDMA

When last descriptor in a descriptor list completed with XferComplete
interrupt, core switching to handle next descriptor and assert BNA
interrupt. Both these interrupts are set while dwc2_hsotg_epint()
handler called. Each interrupt should be handled separately: first
XferComplete interrupt then BNA interrupt, otherwise last completed
transfer will not be giveback to function driver as completed
request.
