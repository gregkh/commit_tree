pwm: mxs: Don't modify HW state in .probe() after the PWM chip was registered

This fixes a race condition: After pwmchip_add() is called there might
already be a consumer and then modifying the hardware behind the
consumer's back is bad. So reset before calling pwmchip_add().

Note that reseting the hardware isn't the right thing to do if the PWM
is already running as it might e.g. disable (or even enable) a backlight
that is supposed to be on (or off).
