iio: buffer: Move a sanity check at the beginning of 'iio_scan_mask_set()'

This is more standard to have sanity checks at the entry of a function,
instead of allocating some memory first and having to free it if a
condition is not met.

Shuffle code a bit to check 'masklength' before calling 'bitmap_alloc()'
