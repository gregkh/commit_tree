coresight: config: Add preloaded configurations

Preload set of configurations.

This patch creates a small set of preloaded configurations and features
that are available immediately after coresight has been initialised.

The current set provides a strobing feature for ETMv4, that creates a
periodic sampling of trace by switching trace generation on and off
using counters in the ETM.

A configuration called "autofdo" is also provided that uses the 'strobing'
feature and provides a couple of preset values, selectable on the perf
command line.
