net: dsa: sja1105: be stateless when installing FDB entries

Currently there are issues when adding a bridge FDB entry as VLAN-aware
and deleting it as VLAN-unaware, or vice versa.

However this is an unneeded complication, since the bridge always
installs its default FDB entries in VLAN 0 to match on VLAN-unaware
ports, and in the default_pvid (VLAN 1) to match on VLAN-aware ports.
So instead of trying to outsmart the bridge, just install all entries it
gives us, and they will start matching packets when the vlan_filtering
mode changes.
