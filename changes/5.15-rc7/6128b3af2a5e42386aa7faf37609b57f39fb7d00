mm: ignore MAP_DENYWRITE in ksys_mmap_pgoff()

Let's also remove masking off MAP_DENYWRITE from ksys_mmap_pgoff():
the last in-tree occurrence of MAP_DENYWRITE is now in LEGACY_MAP_MASK,
which accepts the flag e.g., for MAP_SHARED_VALIDATE; however, the flag
is ignored throughout the kernel now.

Add a comment to LEGACY_MAP_MASK stating that MAP_DENYWRITE is ignored.
