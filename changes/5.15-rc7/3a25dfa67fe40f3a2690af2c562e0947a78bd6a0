KVM: nVMX: promptly process interrupts delivered while in guest mode

Since commit c300ab9f08df ("KVM: x86: Replace late check_nested_events() hack with
more precise fix") there is no longer the certainty that check_nested_events()
tries to inject an external interrupt vmexit to L1 on every call to vcpu_enter_guest.
Therefore, even in that case we need to set KVM_REQ_EVENT.  This ensures
that inject_pending_event() is called, and from there kvm_check_nested_events().
