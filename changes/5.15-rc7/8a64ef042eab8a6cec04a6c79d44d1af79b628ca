nfp: bpf: silence bitwise vs. logical OR warning

A new warning in clang points out two places in this driver where
boolean expressions are being used with a bitwise OR instead of a
logical one:

drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfp_asm.c:199:20: error: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Werror,-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
        reg->src_lmextn = swreg_lmextn(lreg) | swreg_lmextn(rreg);
                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                             ||
drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfp_asm.c:199:20: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfp_asm.c:280:20: error: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Werror,-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
        reg->src_lmextn = swreg_lmextn(lreg) | swreg_lmextn(rreg);
                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                                             ||
drivers/net/ethernet/netronome/nfp/nfp_asm.c:280:20: note: cast one or both operands to int to silence this warning
2 errors generated.

The motivation for the warning is that logical operations short circuit
while bitwise operations do not. In this case, it does not seem like
short circuiting is harmful so implement the suggested fix of changing
to a logical operation to fix the warning.
