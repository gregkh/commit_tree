perf test: Re-add pmu-event uncore PMU alias test

Add support to match aliases for uncore PMUs.

Since we cannot rely on the PMUs being present on the host system, use
fake PMUs.

The following conditions in the test are ensures:

- Expected count of aliases created

- All aliases can be matched to an expected alias in
  perf_pmu_test_pmu.aliases

This will catch the condition fixed in commit c47a5599eda3 ("perf tools:
Fix pattern matching for same substring in different PMU type"), where
excess events were created for a PMU. It will also fix the scenario
inadvertently broken there, where no aliases were created for aliases
with multiple tokens.
