btrfs: zoned: add asserts on splitting extent_map

We call split_zoned_em() on an extent_map on submitting a bio for it. Thus,
we can assume the extent_map is PINNED, not LOGGING, and in the modified
list. Add ASSERT()s to ensure the extent_maps after the split also has the
proper flags set and are in the modified list.
