KVM: arm64: placeholder to check if VM is protected

Add a function to check whether a VM is protected (under pKVM).
Since the creation of protected VMs isn't enabled yet, this is a
placeholder that always returns false. The intention is for this
to become a check for protected VMs in the future (see Will's RFC).

No functional change intended.
