ALSA: usb-audio: Provide quirk for Sennheiser GSP670 Headset

As per discussion at: https://github.com/szszoke/sennheiser-gsp670-pulseaudio-profile/issues/13

The GSP670 has 2 playback and 1 recording device that by default are
detected in an incompatible order for alsa. This may have been done to make
it compatible for the console by the manufacturer and only affects the
latest firmware which uses its own ID.

This quirk will resolve this by reordering the channels.
