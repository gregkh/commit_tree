bus: ixp4xx: Add a driver for IXP4xx expansion bus

The Intel IXP4xx SoCs have an expansion bus that is usually just
used for flash memory and configured by the boot loaders and can
be accessed using the "simple-bus".

However some devices need more elaborate configuration and then we
need to provide a proper 3-unit address space indicating chip
select for each device and provide timing and similar information.
