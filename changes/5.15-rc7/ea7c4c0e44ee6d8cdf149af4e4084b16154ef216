Bluetooth: btintel: Fix the first HCI command not work with ROM device

The some legacy ROM controllers have a bug with the first HCI command
sent to it returning number of completed commands as zero, which would
stall the command processing in the Bluetooth core.

As a workaround, send HCI Rest command first which will reset the
controller to fix the issue.
