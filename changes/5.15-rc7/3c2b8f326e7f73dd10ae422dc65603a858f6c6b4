drm/i915/ttm: Adjust gem flags and caching settings after a move

After a TTM move or object init we need to update the i915 gem flags and
caching settings to reflect the new placement. Currently caching settings
are not changed during the lifetime of an object, although that might
change moving forward if we run into performance issues or issues with
WC system page allocations.
Also introduce gpu_binds_iomem() and cpu_maps_iomem() to clean up the
various ways we previously used to detect this.
Finally, initialize the TTM object reserved to be able to update
flags and caching before anyone else gets hold of the object.
