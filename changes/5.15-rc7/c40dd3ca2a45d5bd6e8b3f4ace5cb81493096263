erofs: clear compacted_2b if compacted_4b_initial > totalidx

Currently, the whole indexes will only be compacted 4B if
compacted_4b_initial > totalidx. So, the calculated compacted_2b
is worthless for that case. It may waste CPU resources.

No need to update compacted_4b_initial as mkfs since it's used to
fulfill the alignment of the 1st compacted_2b pack and would handle
the case above.

We also need to clarify compacted_4b_end here. It's used for the
last lclusters which aren't fitted in the previous compacted_2b
packs.

Some messages are from Xiang.
