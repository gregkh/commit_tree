mm, slab: split out the cpu offline variant of flush_slab()

flush_slab() is called either as part IPI handler on given live cpu, or as a
cleanup on behalf of another cpu that went offline. The first case needs to
protect updating the kmem_cache_cpu fields with disabled irqs. Currently the
whole call happens with irqs disabled by the IPI handler, but the following
patch will change from IPI to workqueue, and flush_slab() will have to disable
irqs (to be replaced with a local lock later) in the critical part.

To prepare for this change, replace the call to flush_slab() for the dead cpu
handling with an opencoded variant that will not disable irqs nor take a local
lock.
