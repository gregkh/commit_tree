KVM: arm64: Release mmap_lock when using VM_SHARED with MTE

VM_SHARED mappings are currently forbidden in a memslot with MTE to
prevent two VMs racing to sanitise the same page. However, this check
is performed while holding current->mm's mmap_lock, but fails to release
it. Fix this by releasing the lock when needed.
