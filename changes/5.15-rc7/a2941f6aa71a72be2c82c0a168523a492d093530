nvme: add command id quirk for apple controllers

Some apple controllers use the command id as an index to implementation
specific data structures and will fail if the value is out of bounds.
The nvme driver's recently introduced command sequence number breaks
this controller.

Provide a quirk so these spec incompliant controllers can function as
before. The driver will not have the ability to detect bad completions
when this quirk is used, but we weren't previously checking this anyway.

The quirk bit was selected so that it can readily apply to stable.
