dmaengine: idxd: make I/O interrupt handler one shot

The interrupt thread handler currently loops forever to process outstanding
completions. This causes either an "irq X: nobody cared" kernel splat or
the NMI watchdog kicks in due to running too long in the function. The irq
thread handler is expected to run again after exiting if there are
interrupts fired while the thread handler is running. So the handler code
can process all the completed I/O in a single pass and exit without losing
the follow on completed I/O.
