fs/ntfs3: Limit binary search table size

Current binary search allocates memory for table and fill whole table
before we start actual binary search. This is quite inefficient because
table fill will always be O(n). Also if table is huge we need to
reallocate memory which is costly.

This implementation use just stack memory and always when table is full
we will check if last element is <= and if not start table fill again.
The idea was that it would be same cost as table reallocation.
