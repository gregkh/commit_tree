mm: sparse: pass section_nr to find_memory_block

With CONFIG_SPARSEMEM_EXTREME enabled, __section_nr() which converts
mem_section to section_nr could be costly since it iterates all section
roots to check if the given mem_section is in its range.

On the other hand, __nr_to_section() which converts section_nr to
mem_section can be done in O(1).

Let's pass section_nr instead of mem_section ptr to find_memory_block() in
order to reduce needless iterations.
