mctp: unify sockaddr_mctp types

Use the more precise __kernel_sa_family_t for smctp_family, to match
struct sockaddr.

Also, use an unsigned int for the network member; negative networks
don't make much sense. We're already using unsigned for mctp_dev and
mctp_skb_cb, but need to change mctp_sock to suit.
