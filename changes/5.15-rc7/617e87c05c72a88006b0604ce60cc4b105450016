drm/i915/selftest: Fix hangcheck self test for GuC submission

When GuC submission is enabled, the GuC controls engine resets. Rather
than explicitly triggering a reset, the driver must submit a hanging
context to GuC and wait for the reset to occur.

Conversely, one of the tests specifically sends hanging batches to the
engines but wants them to sit around until a manual reset of the full
GT (including GuC itself). That means disabling GuC based engine
resets to prevent those from killing the hanging batch too soon. So,
add support to the scheduling policy helper for disabling resets as
well as making them quicker!

In GuC submission mode, the 'is engine idle' test basically turns into
'is engine PM wakelock held'. Independently, there is a heartbeat
disable helper function that the tests use. For unexplained reasons,
this acquires the engine wakelock before disabling the heartbeat and
only releases it when re-enabling the heartbeat. As one of the tests
tries to do a wait for idle in the middle of a heartbeat disabled
section, it is therefore guaranteed to always fail. Added a 'no_pm'
variant of the heartbeat helper that allows the engine to be asleep
while also having heartbeats disabled.
