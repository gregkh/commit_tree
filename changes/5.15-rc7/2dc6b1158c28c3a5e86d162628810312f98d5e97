fs: dlm: introduce generic listen

This patch combines each transport layer listen functionality into one
listen function. Per transport layer differences are provided by
additional callbacks in dlm_proto_ops.

This patch drops silently sock_set_keepalive() for listen tcp sockets
only. This socket option is not set at connecting sockets, I also don't
see the sense of set keepalive for sockets which are created by accept()
only.
