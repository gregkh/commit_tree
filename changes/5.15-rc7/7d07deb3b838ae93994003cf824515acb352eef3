EDAC/altera: Skip defining unused structures for specific configs

The Altera EDAC driver has several features conditionally built
depending on Kconfig options. The edac_device_prv_data structures
are conditionally used in of_device_id tables. They reference other
functions and structures which can be defined as __maybe_unused.

Silence build warnings like:

  drivers/edac/altera_edac.c:643:37: warning:
      ‘altr_edac_device_inject_fops’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
