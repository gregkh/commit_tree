MAINTAINERS: Add Alyssa Rosenzweig as M1 reviewer

Add myself as a reviewer for Asahi Linux (Apple M1) patches.

I would like to be CC'ed on Asahi Linux patches for review and testing.
I am also collecting Asahi Linux patches downstream, rebasing on
linux-next periodically, and would like to be notified of what to
cherry-pick from lists.
