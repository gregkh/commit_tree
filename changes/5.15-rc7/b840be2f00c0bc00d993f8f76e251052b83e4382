lockd: don't attempt blocking locks on nfs reexports

As in the v4 case, it doesn't work well to block waiting for a lock on
an nfs filesystem.

As in the v4 case, that means we're depending on the client to poll.
It's probably incorrect to depend on that, but I *think* clients do poll
in practice.  In any case, it's an improvement over hanging the lockd
thread indefinitely as we currently are.
