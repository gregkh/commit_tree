hrtimer: Add bases argument to clock_was_set()

clock_was_set() unconditionaly invokes retrigger_next_event() on all online
CPUs. This was necessary because that mechanism was also used for resume
from suspend to idle which is not longer the case.

The bases arguments allows the callers of clock_was_set() to hand in a mask
which tells clock_was_set() which of the hrtimer clock bases are affected
by the clock setting. This mask will be used in the next step to check
whether a CPU base has timers queued on a clock base affected by the event
and avoid the SMP function call if there are none.

Add a @bases argument, provide defines for the active bases masking and
fixup all callsites.
