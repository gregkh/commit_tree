usb: gadget: f_uac2: fixed EP-IN wMaxPacketSize

Async feedback patches broke enumeration on Windows 10 previously fixed
by commit 789ea77310f0 ("usb: gadget: f_uac2: always increase endpoint
max_packet_size by one audio slot").

While the existing calculation for EP OUT capture for async mode yields
size+1 frame due to uac2_opts->fb_max > 0, playback side lost the +1
feature.  Therefore the +1 frame addition must be re-introduced for
playback. Win10 enumerates the device only when both EP IN and EP OUT
max packet sizes are (at least) +1 frame.
