ASoC: fsl_xcvr: Fix channel swap issue with ARC

With pause and resume test for ARC, there is occasionally
channel swap issue. The reason is that currently driver set
the DPATH out of reset first, then start the DMA, the first
data got from FIFO may not be the Left channel.

Moving DPATH out of reset operation after the dma enablement
to fix this issue.
