tty: move tty_buffer definitions to new tty_buffer.h

tty.h is large enough currently. And I am slowly adding kernel-doc
documentation, so it grows to unmaintainable long mess. To avoid this,
split tty.h further into tty_buffer.h and move there tty_buffer-related
declarations and function prototypes.

Note that many of the tty_buffer.c function prototypes reside now in
tty_flip.h. But we cannot move struct tty_buffer & friends because:
* tty_insert_flip_char() in tty_flip.h needs both struct tty_port and
  struct tty_buffer defined.
* struct tty_port in tty_port.h needs struct tty_buffer defined.

So if we moved struct tty_buffer to tty_flip.h too, tty_flip.h would
need tty_port.h and that would need tty_flip.h (to have tty_buffer)
again. Hence we introduce new header tty_buffer.h here to break this
circular dependency.
