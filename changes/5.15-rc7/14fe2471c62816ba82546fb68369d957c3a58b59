net/mlx5: Lag, change multipath and bonding to be mutually exclusive

Both multipath and bonding events are changing the HW LAG state
independently.
Handling one of the features events while the other is already
enabled can cause unwanted behavior, for example handling
bonding event while multipath enabled will disable the lag and
cause multipath to stop working.

Fix it by ignoring bonding event while in multipath and ignoring FIB
events while in bonding mode.
