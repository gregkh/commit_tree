drm/i915: move i915_active slab to direct module init/exit

With the global kmem_cache shrink infrastructure gone there's nothing
special and we can convert them over.

I'm doing this split up into each patch because there's quite a bit of
noise with removing the static global.slab_cache to just a slab_cache.

v2: Make slab static (Jason, 0day)
