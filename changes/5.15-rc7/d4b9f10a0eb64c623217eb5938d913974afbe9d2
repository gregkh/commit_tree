HID: magicmouse: enable high-resolution scroll

The Magic Mouse, generations 1 and 2, doesn't have a physical scroll
wheel, instead, the REL_WHEEL and REL_HWHEEL events are emulated
when sliding a finger on the surface of the mouse.
However, the smooth movement of the finger is transformed into a step
based scroll on the screen, leading to a suboptimal user experience.

Emulate high-resolution scroll by sending REL_WHEEL_HI_RES and
REL_HWHEEL_HI_RES events so the scroll on the screen is closer to the
finger movement.
