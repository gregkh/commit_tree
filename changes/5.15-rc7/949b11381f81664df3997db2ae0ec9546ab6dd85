perf/x86/intel/uncore: Add Sapphire Rapids server CHA support

CHA merges the caching agent and Home Agent (HA) responsibilities of the
chip into a single block. It's one of the Sapphire Rapids server uncore
units.

The layout of the control registers for a CHA uncore unit is a little
bit different from the generic one. The CHA uncore unit also supports a
filter register for TID. So a specific format and ops are required.
Expose the common MSR ops which can be reused.
