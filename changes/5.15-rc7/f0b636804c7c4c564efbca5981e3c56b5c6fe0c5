iommu/dart: Clear sid2group entry when a group is freed

sid2groups keeps track of which stream id combinations belong to a
iommu_group to assign those correctly to devices.
When a iommu_group is freed a stale pointer will however remain in
sid2groups. This prevents devices with the same stream id combination
to ever be attached again (see below).
Fix that by creating a shadow copy of the stream id configuration
when a group is allocated for the first time and clear the sid2group
entry when that group is freed.
