net: stmmac: Fix E2E delay mechanism

When utilizing End to End delay mechanism, the following error messages show up:

|root@ehl1:~# ptp4l --tx_timestamp_timeout=50 -H -i eno2 -E -m

Commit f2fb6b6275eb ("net: stmmac: enable timestamp snapshot for required PTP
packets in dwmac v5.10a") already addresses this problem for the dwmac
v5.10. However, same holds true for all dwmacs above version v4.10. Correct the
check accordingly. Afterwards everything works as expected.

Tested on Intel Atom(R) x6414RE Processor.

Fixes: 14f347334bf2 ("net: stmmac: Correctly take timestamp for PTPv2")
Fixes: f2fb6b6275eb ("net: stmmac: enable timestamp snapshot for required PTP packets in dwmac v5.10a")
