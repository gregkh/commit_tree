libbpf: Rename libbpf documentation index file

This patch renames a documentation libbpf.rst to index.rst. In order
for readthedocs.org to pick this file up and properly build the
documentation site.

It also changes the title type of the ABI subsection in the
naming convention doc. This is so that readthedocs.org doesn't treat this
section as a separate document.
