x86/resctrl: Add a separate schema list for resctrl

Resctrl exposes schemata to user-space, which allow the control values
to be specified for a group of tasks.

User-visible properties of the interface, (such as the schemata names
and how the values are parsed) are rooted in a struct provided by the
architecture code. (struct rdt_hw_resource). Once a second architecture
uses resctrl, this would allow user-visible properties to diverge
between architectures.

These properties should come from the resctrl code that will be common
to all architectures. Resctrl has no per-schema structure, only struct
rdt_{hw_,}resource. Create a struct resctrl_schema to hold the
rdt_resource. Before a second architecture can be supported, this
structure will also need to hold the schema name visible to user-space
and the type of configuration values for resctrl.
