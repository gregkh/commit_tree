iommu: Express DMA strictness via the domain type

Eliminate the iommu_get_dma_strict() indirection and pipe the
information through the domain type from the beginning. Besides
the flow simplification this also has several nice side-effects:

 - Automatically implies strict mode for untrusted devices by
   virtue of their IOMMU_DOMAIN_DMA override.
 - Ensures that we only end up using flush queues for drivers
   which are aware of them and can actually benefit.
 - Allows us to handle flush queue init failure by falling back
   to strict mode instead of leaving it to possibly blow up later.
