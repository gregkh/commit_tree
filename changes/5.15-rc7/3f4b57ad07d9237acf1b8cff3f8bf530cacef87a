ASoC: pcm512x: Mend accesses to the I2S_1 and I2S_2 registers

Commit 25d27c4f68d2 ("ASoC: pcm512x: Add support for more data formats")
breaks the TSE-850 device, which is using a pcm5142 in I2S and
CBM_CFS mode (maybe not relevant). Without this fix, the result
is:

pcm512x 0-004c: Failed to set data format: -16

And after that, no sound.

This fix is not 100% correct. The datasheet of at least the pcm5142
states that four bits (0xcc) in the I2S_1 register are "RSV"
("Reserved. Do not access.") and no hint is given as to what the
initial values are supposed to be. So, specifying defaults for
these bits is wrong. But perhaps better than a broken driver?
