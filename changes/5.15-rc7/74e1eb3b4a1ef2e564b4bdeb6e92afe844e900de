serial: mvebu-uart: fix driver's tx_empty callback

Driver's tx_empty callback should signal when the transmit shift register
is empty. So when the last character has been sent.

STAT_TX_FIFO_EMP bit signals only that HW transmit FIFO is empty, which
happens when the last byte is loaded into transmit shift register.

STAT_TX_EMP bit signals when the both HW transmit FIFO and transmit shift
register are empty.

So replace STAT_TX_FIFO_EMP check by STAT_TX_EMP in mvebu_uart_tx_empty()
callback function.
