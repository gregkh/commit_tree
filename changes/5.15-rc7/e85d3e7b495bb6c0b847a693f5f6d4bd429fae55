KVM: x86: SVM: call KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES on exit from SMM mode

Currently the KVM_REQ_GET_NESTED_STATE_PAGES on SVM only reloads PDPTRs,
and MSR bitmap, with former not really needed for SMM as SMM exit code
reloads them again from SMRAM'S CR3, and later happens to work
since MSR bitmap isn't modified while in SMM.

Still it is better to be consistient with VMX.
