ASoC: nau8824: Fix headphone vs headset, button-press detection no longer working

Commit 1d25684e2251 ("ASoC: nau8824: Fix open coded prefix handling")
replaced the nau8824_dapm_enable_pin() helper with direct calls to
snd_soc_dapm_enable_pin(), but the helper was using
snd_soc_dapm_force_enable_pin() and not forcing the MICBIAS + SAR
supplies on breaks headphone vs headset and button-press detection.

Replace the snd_soc_dapm_enable_pin() calls with
snd_soc_dapm_force_enable_pin() to fix this.
