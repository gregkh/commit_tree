scsi: qla2xxx: edif: Add extraction of auth_els from the wire

Some FC adapters from Marvell offer the ability to encrypt data in flight
(EDIF). This feature requires an application to act as an authenticator.

Once authentication messages sent from a remote device have arrived, each
message is extracted and placed in a buffer for application to retrieve.
The FC frame header will be stripped, leaving behind the AUTH ELS payload.
It is up to the application to strip the AUTH ELS header to get to the
actual authentication message.
