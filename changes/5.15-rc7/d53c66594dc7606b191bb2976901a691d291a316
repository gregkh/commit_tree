habanalabs: fix potential race in interrupt wait ioctl

We have a potential race where a user interrupt can be received
in between user thread value comparison and before request was
added to wait list. This means that if no consecutive interrupt
will be received, user thread will timeout and fail.

The solution is to add the request to wait list before we
perform the comparison.
