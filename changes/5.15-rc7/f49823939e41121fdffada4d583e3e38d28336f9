net: phy: Do not shutdown PHYs in READY state

In case a PHY device was probed thus in the PHY_READY state, but not
configured and with no network device attached yet, we should not be
trying to shut it down because it has been brought back into reset by
phy_device_reset() towards the end of phy_probe() and anyway we have not
configured the PHY yet.
