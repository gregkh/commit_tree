regulator: sy8824x: Enable REGCACHE_FLAT

Enable regmap cache to reduce i2c transactions and corresponding
interrupts if regulator is accessed frequently. Since the register map
is small -- there's only one register in sy8824c and sy8824e, there
are only two registers in sy20276 and sy20278, so we use a FLAT regmap
cache.
