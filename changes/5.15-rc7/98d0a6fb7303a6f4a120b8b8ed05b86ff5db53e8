ceph: skip existing superblocks that are blocklisted or shut down when mounting

Currently when mounting, we may end up finding an existing superblock
that corresponds to a blocklisted MDS client. This means that the new
mount ends up being unusable.

If we've found an existing superblock with a client that is already
blocklisted, and the client is not configured to recover on its own,
fail the match. Ditto if the superblock has been forcibly unmounted.

While we're in here, also rename "other" to the more conventional "fsc".
