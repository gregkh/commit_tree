mm/migrate: add CPU hotplug to demotion #ifdef

Once upon a time, the node demotion updates were driven solely by memory
hotplug events.  But now, there are handlers for both CPU and memory
hotplug.

However, the #ifdef around the code checks only memory hotplug.  A
system that has HOTPLUG_CPU=y but MEMORY_HOTPLUG=n would miss CPU
hotplug events.

Update the #ifdef around the common code.  Add memory and CPU-specific
#ifdefs for their handlers.  These memory/CPU #ifdefs avoid unused
function warnings when their Kconfig option is off.
