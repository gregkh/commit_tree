locking/spinlock: Provide RT specific spinlock_t

RT replaces spinlocks with a simple wrapper around an rtmutex, which turns
spinlocks on RT into 'sleeping' spinlocks. The actual implementation of the
spinlock API differs from a regular rtmutex, as it does neither handle
timeouts nor signals and it is state preserving across the lock operation.
