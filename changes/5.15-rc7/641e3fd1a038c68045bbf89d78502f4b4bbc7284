nfc: st95hf: Make spi remove() callback return zero

If something goes wrong in the remove callback, returning an error code
just results in an error message. The device still disappears.

So don't skip disabling the regulator in st95hf_remove() if resetting
the controller via spi fails. Also don't return an error code which just
results in two error messages.
