ARM: 9122/1: select HAVE_FUTEX_CMPXCHG

tglx notes:
  This function [futex_detect_cmpxchg] is only needed when an
  architecture has to runtime discover whether the CPU supports it or
  not.  ARM has unconditional support for this, so the obvious thing to
  do is the below.

Fixes linkage failure from Clang randconfigs:
kernel/futex.o:(.text.fixup+0x5c): relocation truncated to fit: R_ARM_JUMP24 against `.init.text'
and boot failures for CONFIG_THUMB2_KERNEL.
