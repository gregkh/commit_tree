net: stmmac: dwmac-rk: Fix ethernet on rk3399 based devices

Commit 2d26f6e39afb ("net: stmmac: dwmac-rk: fix unbalanced pm_runtime_enable warnings")
while getting rid of a runtime PM warning ended up breaking ethernet
on rk3399 based devices. By dropping an extra reference to the device,
the commit ends up enabling suspend / resume of the ethernet device -
which appears to be broken.

While the issue with runtime pm is being investigated, partially
revert commit 2d26f6e39afb to restore the network on rk3399.
