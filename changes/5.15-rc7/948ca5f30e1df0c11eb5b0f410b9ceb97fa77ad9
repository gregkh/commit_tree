ext4: enforce buffer head state assertion in ext4_da_map_blocks

Remove the code that re-initializes a buffer head with an invalid block
number and BH_New and BH_Delay bits when a matching delayed and
unwritten block has been found in the extent status cache. Replace it
with assertions that verify the buffer head already has this state
correctly set.  The current code masked an inline data truncation bug
that left stale entries in the extent status cache.  With this change,
generic/130 can be used to reproduce and detect that bug.
