net: arc: select CRC32

Fix the following build/link error by adding a dependency on the CRC32
routines:

  ld: drivers/net/ethernet/arc/emac_main.o: in function `arc_emac_set_rx_mode':
  emac_main.c:(.text+0xb11): undefined reference to `crc32_le'

The crc32_le() call comes through the ether_crc_le() call in
arc_emac_set_rx_mode().

[v2: moved the select to ARC_EMAC_CORE; the Makefile is a bit confusing,
but the error comes from emac_main.o, which is part of the arc_emac module,
which in turn is enabled by CONFIG_ARC_EMAC_CORE. Note that arc_emac is
different from emac_arc...]
