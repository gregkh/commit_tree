vsock_diag_test: remove free_sock_stat() call in test_no_sockets

In `test_no_sockets` we don't expect any sockets, indeed
check_no_sockets() prints an error and exits if `sockets` list is
not empty, so free_sock_stat() call is unnecessary since it would
only be called when the `sockets` list is empty.

This was discovered by a strange warning printed by gcc v11.2.1:
  In file included from ../../include/linux/list.h:7,
                   from vsock_diag_test.c:18:
  vsock_diag_test.c: In function ‘test_no_sockets’:

It seems related to some compiler optimization and assumption
about the empty `sockets` list, since this warning is printed
only with -02 or -O3. Also removing `exit(1)` from
check_no_sockets() makes the warning disappear since in that
case free_sock_stat() can be reached also when the list is
not empty.
