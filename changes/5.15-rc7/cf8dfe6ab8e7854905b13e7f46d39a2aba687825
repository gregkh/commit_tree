net: ipa: get another clock for ipa_setup()

Two places call ipa_setup().  The first, ipa_probe(), holds an IPA
clock reference when calling ipa_setup() (if the AP is responsible
for IPA firmware loading).  But if the modem is loading IPA
firmware, ipa_smp2p_modem_setup_ready_isr() calls ipa_setup() after
the modem has signaled the hardware is ready.  This can happen at
any time, and there is no guarantee the hardware is active.

Have ipa_smp2p_modem_setup() take an IPA clock reference before it
calls ipa_setup(), and release it once setup is complete.
