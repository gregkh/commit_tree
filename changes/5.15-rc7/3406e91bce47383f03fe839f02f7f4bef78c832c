mm, slub: make locking in deactivate_slab() irq-safe

dectivate_slab() now no longer touches the kmem_cache_cpu structure, so it will
be possible to call it with irqs enabled. Just convert the spin_lock calls to
their irq saving/restoring variants to make it irq-safe.

Note we now have to use cmpxchg_double_slab() for irq-safe slab_lock(), because
in some situations we don't take the list_lock, which would disable irqs.
