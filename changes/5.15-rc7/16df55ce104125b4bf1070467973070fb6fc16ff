mips: clean up (remove) kernel-doc in cavium-octeon/executive/

Remove all kernel-doc notation in arch/mips/cavium-octeon/executive/.
This removes dozens of kernel-doc warnings.

Most of these functions are static and don't need to be documented
with kernel-doc.
The function comments are still present for anyone who wants to read them.
These files are part of the OCTEON SDK so presumably they are documented
there as well.
