perf evsel: Separate missing feature disabling from evsel__open_cpu

This is a preparatory patch for the patches in the workqueue series with
the goal to separate in evlist__open_cpu() the actual opening, which
could be performed in parallel, from the existing fallback mechanisms,
which should be handled sequentially.

This patch separates the disabling of missing features from
evlist__open_cpu() into a new function evsel__disable_missing_features(().
