mm, slub: remove redundant unfreeze_partials() from put_cpu_partial()

Commit d6e0b7fa1186 ("slub: make dead caches discard free slabs immediately")
introduced cpu partial flushing for kmemcg caches, based on setting the target
cpu_partial to 0 and adding a flushing check in put_cpu_partial().
This code that sets cpu_partial to 0 was later moved by c9fc586403e7 ("slab:
introduce __kmemcg_cache_deactivate()") and ultimately removed by 9855609bde03
("mm: memcg/slab: use a single set of kmem_caches for all accounted
allocations"). However the check and flush in put_cpu_partial() was never
removed, although it's effectively a dead code. So this patch removes it.

Note that d6e0b7fa1186 also added preempt_disable()/enable() to
unfreeze_partials() which could be thus also considered unnecessary. But
further patches will rely on it, so keep it.
