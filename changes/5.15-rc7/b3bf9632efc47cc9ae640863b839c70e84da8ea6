torture: Don't use "test" command's "-a" argument

There was a time long ago when the "test" command's documentation
claimed that the "-a" and "-o" arguments did something useful.
But this documentation now suggests letting the shell execute
these boolean operators, so this commit applies that suggestion to
kvm-test-1-run-qemu.sh.
