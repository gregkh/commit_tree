bpf, test, cgroup: Use sk_{alloc,free} for test cases

BPF test infra has some hacks in place which kzalloc() a socket and perform
minimum init via sock_net_set() and sock_init_data(). As a result, the sk's
skcd->cgroup is NULL since it didn't go through proper initialization as it
would have been the case from sk_alloc(). Rather than re-adding a NULL test
in sock_cgroup_ptr() just for this, use sk_{alloc,free}() pair for the test
socket. The latter also allows to get rid of the bpf_sk_storage_free() special
case.

Fixes: b7a1848e8398 ("bpf: add BPF_PROG_TEST_RUN support for flow dissector")
Fixes: 2cb494a36c98 ("bpf: add tests for direct packet access from CGROUP_SKB")
