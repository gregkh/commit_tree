eeprom: 93xx46: fix MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE

The newly added SPI device ID table does not work because the
entry is incorrectly copied from the OF device table.

During build testing, this shows as a compile failure when building
it as a loadable module:

drivers/misc/eeprom/eeprom_93xx46.c:424:1: error: redefinition of '__mod_of__eeprom_93xx46_of_table_device_table'
MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE(of, eeprom_93xx46_of_table);

Change the entry to refer to the correct symbol.
