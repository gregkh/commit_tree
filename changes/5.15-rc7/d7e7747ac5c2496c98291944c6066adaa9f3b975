netfilter: refuse insertion if chain has grown too large

Also add a stat counter for this that gets exported both via old /proc
interface and ctnetlink.

Assuming the old default size of 16536 buckets and max hash occupancy of
64k, this results in 128k insertions (origin+reply), so ~8 entries per
chain on average.

The revised settings in this series will result in about two entries per
bucket on average.

This allows a hard-limit ceiling of 64.

This is not tunable at the moment, but its possible to either increase
nf_conntrack_buckets or decrease nf_conntrack_max to reduce average
lengths.
