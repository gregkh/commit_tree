scripts/kernel-doc: Override -Werror from KCFLAGS with KDOC_WERROR

Since commit 2c12c8103d8f ("scripts/kernel-doc: optionally treat
warnings as errors"), the kernel-doc script will treat warnings as
errors when one of the following conditions is true:

- The KDOC_WERROR environment variable is non-zero
- The KCFLAGS environment variable contains -Werror
- The -Werror parameter is passed to kernel-doc

Checking KCFLAGS for -Werror allows piggy-backing on the C compiler
error handling. However, unlike the C compiler, kernel-doc has no
provision for -Wno-error. This makes compiling the kernel with -Werror
(to catch regressions) and W=1 (to enable more checks) always fail,
without the same possibility as offered by the C compiler to treating
some selected warnings as warnings despite the global -Werror setting.

To fix this, evaluate KDOC_WERROR after KCFLAGS, which allows disabling
the warnings-as-errors behaviour of kernel-doc selectively by setting
KDOC_WERROR=0.
