sched/scs: Reset the shadow stack when idle_task_exit

Commit f1a0a376ca0c ("sched/core: Initialize the idle task with
preemption disabled") removed the init_idle() call from
idle_thread_get(). This was the sole call-path on hotplug that resets
the Shadow Call Stack (scs) Stack Pointer (sp).

Not resetting the scs-sp leads to scs overflow after enough hotplug
cycles. Therefore add an explicit scs_task_reset() to the hotplug code
to make sure the scs-sp does get reset on hotplug.
