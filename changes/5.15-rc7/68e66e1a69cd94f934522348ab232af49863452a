net/mlx5e: Fix vlan data lost during suspend flow

During suspend flow the driver calls mlx5e_destroy_vlan_table() which
does not only delete the vlans steering flow rules, but also frees the
data on currently active vlans, thus it is not restored during resume
flow.

This fix keeps the vlan data on suspend flow and frees it only on driver
remove flow.
