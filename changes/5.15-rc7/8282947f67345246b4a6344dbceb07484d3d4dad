locking/rwlock: Provide RT variant

Similar to rw_semaphores, on RT the rwlock substitution is not writer fair,
because it's not feasible to have a writer inherit its priority to
multiple readers. Readers blocked on a writer follow the normal rules of
priority inheritance. Like RT spinlocks, RT rwlocks are state preserving
across the slow lock operations (contended case).
