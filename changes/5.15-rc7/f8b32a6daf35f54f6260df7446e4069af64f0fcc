ALSA: hda/sigmatel - Sink stac_shutup() into stac_suspend()

When CONFIG_PM is not set, there is an unused function warning:

sound/pci/hda/patch_sigmatel.c:4383:13: warning: unused function
'stac_shutup' [-Wunused-function]
static void stac_shutup(struct hda_codec *codec)
            ^
1 warning generated.

Sink the contents of stac_shutup() into stac_suspend() since
stac_shutup() is only called in that one location now.
