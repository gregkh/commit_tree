media: imx258: Limit the max analogue gain to 480

The range for analog gain mentioned in the datasheet is [0, 480].
The real gain formula mentioned in the datasheet is:

	Gain = 512 / (512 â€“ X)

Hence, values larger than 511 clearly makes no sense. The gain
register field is also documented to be of 9-bits in the datasheet.

Certainly, it is enough to infer that, the kernel driver currently
advertises an arbitrary analog gain max. Fix it by rectifying the
value as per the data sheet i.e. 480.
