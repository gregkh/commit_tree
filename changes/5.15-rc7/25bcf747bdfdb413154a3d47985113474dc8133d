staging: r8188eu: remove set but unused variable from rtl8188e_Add_RateATid

Remove set but unused variable init_rate from the rtl8188e_Add_RateATid
function in hal/rtl8188eu_cmd.c, as this fixes a kernel test robot
warning. Removing the call to get_highest_rate_idx has no side effects
here so is safe.
