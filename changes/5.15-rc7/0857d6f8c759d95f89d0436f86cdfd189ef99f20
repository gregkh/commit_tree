ipv6: When forwarding count rx stats on the orig netdev

Commit bdb7cc643fc9 ("ipv6: Count interface receive statistics on the
ingress netdev") does not work when ip6_forward() executes on the skbs
with vrf-enslaved netdev. Use IP6CB(skb)->iif to get to the right one.

Add a selftest script to verify.
