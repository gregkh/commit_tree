ocfs2: mount fails with buffer overflow in strlen

Starting with kernel 5.11 built with CONFIG_FORTIFY_SOURCE mouting an
ocfs2 filesystem with either o2cb or pcmk cluster stack fails with the
trace below.  Problem seems to be that strings for cluster stack and
cluster name are not guaranteed to be null terminated in the disk
representation, while strlcpy assumes that the source string is always
null terminated.  This causes a read outside of the source string
triggering the buffer overflow detection.
