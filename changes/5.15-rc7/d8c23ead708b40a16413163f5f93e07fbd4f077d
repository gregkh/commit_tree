kunit: tool: better handling of quasi-bool args (--json, --raw_output)

Problem:

What does this do?
$ kunit.py run --json
Well, it runs all the tests and prints test results out as JSON.

And next is
$ kunit.py run my-test-suite --json
This runs just `my-test-suite` and prints results out as JSON.

But what about?
$ kunit.py run --json my-test-suite
This runs all the tests and stores the json results in a "my-test-suite"
file.

Why:
--json, and now --raw_output are actually string flags. They just have a
default value. --json in particular takes the name of an output file.

It was intended that you'd do
$ kunit.py run --json=my_output_file my-test-suite
if you ever wanted to specify the value.

Workaround:
It doesn't seem like there's a way to make
https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html only accept arg values
after a '='.

I believe that `--json` should "just work" regardless of where it is.
So this patch automatically rewrites a bare `--json` to `--json=stdout`.

That makes the examples above work the same way.
Add a regression test that can catch this for --raw_output.
