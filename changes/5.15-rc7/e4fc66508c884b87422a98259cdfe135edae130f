vdpa/mlx5: Ensure valid indices are provided

Following patches add control virtuqeue and multiqueue support. We want
to verify that the index value to callbacks referencing a virtqueue is
valid.

The logic defining valid indices is as follows:
CVQ clear: 0 and 1.
CVQ set, MQ clear: 0, 1 and 2
CVQ set, MQ set: 0..nvq where nvq is whatever provided to
_vdpa_register_device()
