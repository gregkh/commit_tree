drm: correctly restore mappings if drm_open fails

If first drm_open fails, the error-handling path will
incorrectly restore inode's mapping to NULL. This can
cause the crash later on. Fix by separately storing
away mapping pointers that drm_open can touch and
restore each from its own respective variable if the
call fails.

(thanks to Michal Hocko for investigating investigating and
finding the root cause of the bug)

v2: Use one variable to store file and inode mapping
    since they are the same at the function entry.
    Fix spelling mistakes in commit message.

v3: Add reference to the original bug report.
