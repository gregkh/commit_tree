x86, efi: Make "noefi" really disable EFI runtime serivces

commit 1de63d60cd5b ("efi: Clear EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES rather than
EFI_BOOT by "noefi" boot parameter") attempted to make "noefi" true to
its documentation and disable EFI runtime services to prevent the
bricking bug described in commit e0094244e41c ("samsung-laptop:
Disable on EFI hardware"). However, it's not possible to clear
EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES from an early param function because
EFI_RUNTIME_SERVICES is set in efi_init() *after* parse_early_param().

This resulted in "noefi" effectively becoming a no-op and no longer
providing users with a way to disable EFI, which is bad for those
users that have buggy machines.
