macvlan: add a salt to mc_hash()

Some multicast addresses are common to all macvlans,
so if a multicast message has a hash value collision, we
have to deliver a copy to all macvlans, adding significant
latency and possible packet drops if netdev_max_backlog
limit is hit.

Having a per macvlan hash function permits to reduce the
impact of hash collisions.
