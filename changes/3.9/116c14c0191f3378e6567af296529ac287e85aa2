kvm: Fix memory slot generation updates

Previous patch "kvm: Minor memory slot optimization" (b7f69c555ca43)
overlooked the generation field of the memory slots.  Re-using the
original memory slots left us with with two slightly different memory
slots with the same generation.  To fix this, make update_memslots()
take a new parameter to specify the last generation.  This also makes
generation management more explicit to avoid such problems in the future.
