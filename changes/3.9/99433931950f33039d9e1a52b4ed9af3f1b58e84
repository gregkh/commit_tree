drm/i915: use gem_set_seqno() on hardware init

When machine was rebooted or module was reloaded,
gem_hw_init() set last_seqno to be identical to next_seqno.
This lead to situation that waits for first ever request
always passed immediately regardless if it was actually
executed.

Use gem_set_seqno() to be consistent how hw is
initialized on init, wrap and on resume.
