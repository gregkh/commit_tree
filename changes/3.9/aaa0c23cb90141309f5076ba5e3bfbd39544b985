Fix dst_neigh_lookup/dst_neigh_lookup_skb return value handling bug

When neighbour table is full, dst_neigh_lookup/dst_neigh_lookup_skb will return
-ENOBUFS which is absolutely non zero, while all the code in kernel which use
above functions assume failure only on zero return which will cause panic. (for
example: : https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=54731).

This patch corrects above error with smallest changes to kernel source code and
also correct two return value check missing bugs in drivers/infiniband/hw/cxgb4/cm.c

Tested on my x86_64 SMP machine
