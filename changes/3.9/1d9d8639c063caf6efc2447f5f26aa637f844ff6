perf,x86: fix kernel crash with PEBS/BTS after suspend/resume

This patch fixes a kernel crash when using precise sampling (PEBS)
after a suspend/resume. Turns out the CPU notifier code is not invoked
on CPU0 (BP). Therefore, the DS_AREA (used by PEBS) is not restored properly
by the kernel and keeps it power-on/resume value of 0 causing any PEBS
measurement to crash when running on CPU0.

The workaround is to add a hook in the actual resume code to restore
the DS Area MSR value. It is invoked for all CPUS. So for all but CPU0,
the DS_AREA will be restored twice but this is harmless.
