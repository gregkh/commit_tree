cpufreq: governors: Fix WARN_ON() for multi-policy platforms

On multi-policy systems there is a single instance of governor for both the
policies (if same governor is chosen for both policies). With the code update
from following patches:

8eeed09 cpufreq: governors: Get rid of dbs_data->enable field
b394058 cpufreq: governors: Reset tunables only for cpufreq_unregister_governor()

We are creating/removing sysfs directory of governor for for every call to
GOV_START and STOP. This would fail for multi-policy system as there is a
per-policy call to START/STOP.

This patch reuses the governor->initialized variable to detect total users of
governor.
