KVM: MMU: simplify folding of dirty bit into accessed_dirty

MMU code tries to avoid if()s HW is not able to predict reliably by using
bitwise operation to streamline code execution, but in case of a dirty bit
folding this gives us nothing since write_fault is checked right before
the folding code. Lets just piggyback onto the if() to make code more clear.
