    drm/i915: Turn off hsync and vsync on ADPA when disabling crt

properly disabled the hsync/vsync logic at disable time, but neglected
to re-enable them at enable time.

v2: In the enable hook, restore the connector's expected DPMS level
instead of forcing ON.  Do this by stashing a back pointer to the
connector in the crt (suggested by danvet) since otherwise it's awkward
to look up.

[danvet: Added more verbose commit citation and cc: stable tag. Also,
make it compile. Then self-lart and try to assign the right pointer.]
