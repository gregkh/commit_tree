brcmfmac: fix problem connecting to AP without security

The bcm43236 device showed having an issue connection to an AP without
security when auth_type was set to automatic. For this particular device
a workaround is made by selecting open-system. This problem does not
occur when using wpa_supplicant as it will not use auth type automatic.
