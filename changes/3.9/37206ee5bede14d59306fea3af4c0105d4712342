rbd: normalize dout() calls

Add dout() calls to facilitate tracing of image and object requests.
Change a few existing calls so they use __func__ rather than the
hard-coded function name.  Have calls always add ":" after the name
of the function, and prefix pointer values with a consistent tag
indicating what it represents.  (Note that there remain some older
dout() calls that are left untouched by this patch.)

Issue a warning if rbd_osd_write_callback() ever gets a short write.

This resolves:
