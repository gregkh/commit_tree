uprobes: Introduce uprobe_is_active()

The lifetime of uprobe->rb_node and uprobe->inode is not refcounted,
delete_uprobe() is called when we detect that uprobe has no consumers,
and it would be deadly wrong to do this twice.

Change delete_uprobe() to WARN() if it was already called. We use
RB_CLEAR_NODE() to mark uprobe "inactive", then RB_EMPTY_NODE() can
be used to detect this case.

RB_EMPTY_NODE() is not used directly, we add the trivial helper for
the next change.
