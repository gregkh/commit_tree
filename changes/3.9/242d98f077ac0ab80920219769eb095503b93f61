block,elevator: use new hashtable implementation

Switch elevator to use the new hashtable implementation. This reduces the
amount of generic unrelated code in the elevator.

This also removes the dymanic allocation of the hash table. The size of the table is
constant so there's no point in paying the price of an extra dereference when accessing
it.

This patch depends on d9b482c ("hashtable: introduce a small and naive
hashtable") which was merged in v3.6.
