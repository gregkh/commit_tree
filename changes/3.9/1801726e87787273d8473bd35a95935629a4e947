staging: comedi: quatech_daqp_cs: rename the private data struct

The private data in this driver is associated with the comedi_device
pointer not the pcmcia_device. For aesthetic reasons, rename the
private data struct from local_into_t to daqp_private.

Also, rename the local variables used for the private data from
local to devpriv as that is more common in the comedi drivers.
