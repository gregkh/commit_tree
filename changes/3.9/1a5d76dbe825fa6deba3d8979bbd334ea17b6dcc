drivers/base/core.c: Remove two unused variables and two useless calls to kfree

old_class_name, and new_class_name are never used. This patch remove the
declaration and calls to kfree.

The semantic match that finds this problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@r1 forall@
type T; identifier i;
@@
* T *i = NULL;
  ... when != i
* kfree(i);
// </smpl>
