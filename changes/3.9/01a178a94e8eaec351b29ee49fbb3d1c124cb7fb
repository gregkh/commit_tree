acpi, memory-hotplug: support getting hotplug info from SRAT

We now provide an option for users who don't want to specify physical
memory address in kernel commandline.

         /*
          * For movablemem_map=acpi:
          *
          * SRAT:                |_____| |_____| |_________| |_________| ......
          * node id:                0       1         1           2
          * hotpluggable:           n       y         y           n
          * movablemem_map:              |_____| |_________|
          *
          * Using movablemem_map, we can prevent memblock from allocating memory
          * on ZONE_MOVABLE at boot time.
          */

So user just specify movablemem_map=acpi, and the kernel will use
hotpluggable info in SRAT to determine which memory ranges should be set
as ZONE_MOVABLE.

If all the memory ranges in SRAT is hotpluggable, then no memory can be
used by kernel.  But before parsing SRAT, memblock has already reserve
some memory ranges for other purposes, such as for kernel image, and so
on.  We cannot prevent kernel from using these memory.  So we need to
exclude these ranges even if these memory is hotpluggable.

Furthermore, there could be several memory ranges in the single node
which the kernel resides in.  We may skip one range that have memory
reserved by memblock, but if the rest of memory is too small, then the
kernel will fail to boot.  So, make the whole node which the kernel
resides in un-hotpluggable.  Then the kernel has enough memory to use.

NOTE: Using this way will cause NUMA performance down because the
      whole node will be set as ZONE_MOVABLE, and kernel cannot use memory
      on it.  If users don't want to lose NUMA performance, just don't use
      it.
