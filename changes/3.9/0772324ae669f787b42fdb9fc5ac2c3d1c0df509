cpuset: remove fast exit path from remove_tasks_in_empty_cpuset()

The function isn't that hot, the overhead of missing the fast exit is
low, the test itself depends heavily on cgroup internals, and it's
gonna be a hindrance when trying to decouple cpuset locking from
cgroup core.  Remove the fast exit path.
