[media] omap3isp: Fix histogram regions

This patch fixes a bug which causes all histogram regions to start in the
top left corner of the image. The histogram region coordinates are 16 bit
values which share a 32 bit register. The bug is due to the region end
value assignments overwriting the region start values with zero.
