fs/binfmt_elf.c: fix hugetlb memory check in vma_dump_size()

Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt says about coredump_filter bitmask,

  Note bit 0-4 doesn't effect any hugetlb memory. hugetlb memory are only
  effected by bit 5-6.

However current code can go into the subsequent flag checks of bit 0-4
for vma(VM_HUGETLB). So this patch inserts 'return' and makes it work
as written in the document.
