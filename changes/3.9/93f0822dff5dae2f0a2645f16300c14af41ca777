cpufreq/x86: Add P-state driver for sandy bridge.

Add a P-state driver for the Intel Sandy bridge processor. In cpufreq
terminology this driver implements a  scaling driver with an internal
governor.

When built into the the kernel this driver will be the preferred
scaling driver for Sandy bridge processors.

In addition to the interfaces provided by the cpufreq subsystem for
controlling scaling drivers. The user may control the behavior of the
driver via three sysfs files located in
"/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate".

  max_perf_pct: limits the maximum P state that will be requested by
  the driver stated as a percentage of the avail performance.

  min_perf_pct: limits the minimum P state that will be  requested by
  the driver stated as a percentage of the avail performance.

  no_turbo: limits the driver to selecting P states below the turbo
  frequency range.
