ALSA: hda - Add Loopback Mixing control

For codecs that have individual routes going through a loopback mixer
(like VIA codecs), we need to provide an explicit switch to choose
whether the output goes through mixer or directly from DAC.

This patch adds the check for such paths and creates "Loopback Mixing"
enum control when available.

It won't influence on codecs like Realtek or others where the loopback
mixer is connected independently from the primary output routes.
