x86, 64bit, mm: Make pgd next calculation consistent with pud/pmd

Just like the way we calculate next for pud and pmd, aka round down and
add size.

Also, do not do boundary-checking with 'next', and just pass 'end' down
to phys_pud_init() instead. Because the loop in phys_pud_init() stops at
PTRS_PER_PUD and thus can handle a possibly bigger 'end' properly.
