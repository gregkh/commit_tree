ASoC: fsi: remove SH_FSI_xxx_INV flags

3449f5fab8c51e37a8a48bc2516588c615373191
(ASoC: fsi: add SND_SOC_DAIFMT_INV_xxx support)
added clock inversion support via snd_soc_dai_set_fmt().
Thus, this patch removed SH_FSI_xxx_INV and fsi_get_info()
from fsi driver, and modified platform settings to use new style.
Then, it cleaned up meaningless settings from platform.
