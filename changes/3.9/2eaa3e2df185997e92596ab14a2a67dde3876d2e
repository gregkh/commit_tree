cpufreq: Fix locking issues

cpufreq core uses two locks:
- cpufreq_driver_lock: General lock for driver and cpufreq_cpu_data array.
- cpu_policy_rwsemfix locking: per CPU reader-writer semaphore designed to cure
  all cpufreq/hotplug/workqueue/etc related lock issues.

These locks were not used properly and are placed against their principle
(present before their definition) at various places. This patch is an attempt to
fix their use.
