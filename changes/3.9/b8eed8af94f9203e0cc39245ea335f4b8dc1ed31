cpufreq: Simplify __cpufreq_remove_dev()

__cpufreq_remove_dev() is called on multiple occasions: cpufreq_driver
unregister and cpu removals.

Current implementation of this routine is overly complex without much need. If
the cpu to be removed is the policy->cpu, we remove the policy first and add all
other cpus again from policy->cpus and then finally call __cpufreq_remove_dev()
again to remove the cpu to be deleted. Haahhhh..

There exist a simple solution to removal of a cpu:
- Simply use the old policy structure
- update its fields like: policy->cpu, etc.
- notify any users of cpufreq, which depend on changing policy->cpu

Hence this patch, which tries to implement the above theory. It is tested well
by myself on ARM big.LITTLE TC2 SoC, which has 5 cores (2 A15 and 3 A7). Both
A15's share same struct policy and all A7's share same policy structure.
