quota: add missing use of dq_data_lock in __dquot_initialize

The bulk of __dquot_initialize runs under the dqptr_sem which
protects the inode->i_dquot pointers. It doesn't protect the
dereferenced contents, though. Those are protected by the
dq_data_lock, which is missing around the dquot_resv_space call.
