ixgbe: Add support for set_channels ethtool operation

This change adds support for the ethtool set_channels operation.

Since the ixgbe driver has to support DCB as well as the other modes the
assumption I made here is that the number of channels in DCB modes refers
to the number of queues per traffic class, not the number of queues total.
