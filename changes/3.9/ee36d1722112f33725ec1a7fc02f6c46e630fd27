ARC: [plat-arcfpga] Static platform device for CONFIG_SERIAL_ARC

N.B. This is old style of hardcoding platform device specific info
in code and it's instantiation thererof using platform_add_devices().
Subsequent patches replace this with DeviceTree based runtime probe.

This patch has been retained just as an example of "don't-do-this" for
newer kernel ports.
