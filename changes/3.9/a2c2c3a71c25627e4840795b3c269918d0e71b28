ima: "remove enforce checking duplication" merge fix

Commit "750943a ima: remove enforce checking duplication" combined
the 'in IMA policy' and 'enforcing file integrity' checks.  For
the non-file, kernel module verification, a specific check for
'enforcing file integrity' was not added.  This patch adds the
check.
