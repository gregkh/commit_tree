ARM: PXA3xx: program the CSMSADRCFG register

The Chip Select Configuration Register must be programmed to 0x2 in
order to achieve the correct behavior of the Static Memory Controller.

Without this patch devices wired to DFI and accessed through SMC cannot
be accessed after resume from S2.

Do not rely on the boot loader to program the CSMSADRCFG register by
programming it in the kernel smemc module.
