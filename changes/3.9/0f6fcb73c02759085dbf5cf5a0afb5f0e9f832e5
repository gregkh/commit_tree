ALSA: hda - Use standard fixup table for IDT92HD71Bxx

This time, the only intrusive changes are for HP machines.
As the mute LED fixup and the bass speaker switch are required only
for HP machines, we can move these checks into the fixup entries; the
former is applied generically to all HP machines while the latter for
only certain models.
