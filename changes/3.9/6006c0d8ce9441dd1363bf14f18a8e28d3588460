metag: Atomics, locks and bitops

Add header files to implement Meta hardware thread locks (used by some
other atomic operations), atomics, spinlocks, and bitops.

There are 2 main types of atomic primitives for metag (in addition to
IRQs off on UP):
 - LOCK instructions provide locking between hardware threads.
 - LNKGET/LNKSET instructions provide load-linked/store-conditional
   operations allowing for lighter weight atomics on Meta2

LOCK instructions allow for hardware threads to acquire voluntary or
exclusive hardware thread locks:
 - LOCK0 releases exclusive and voluntary lock from the running hardware
   thread.
 - LOCK1 acquires the voluntary hardware lock, blocking until it becomes
   available.
 - LOCK2 implies LOCK1, and additionally acquires the exclusive hardware
   lock, blocking all other hardware threads from executing.
