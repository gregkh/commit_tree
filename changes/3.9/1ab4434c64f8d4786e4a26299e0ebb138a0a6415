bnx2x: Support probing and removing of VF device

To support probing and removing of a bnx2x virtual function
the following were added:
1. add bnx2x_vfpf.h: defines the VF to PF channel
2. add bnx2x_sriov.h: header for bnx2x SR-IOV functionality
3. enumerate VF hw types (identify VFs)
4. if driving a VF, map VF bar
5. if driving a VF, allocate Vf to PF channel
6. refactor interrupt flows to include VF
