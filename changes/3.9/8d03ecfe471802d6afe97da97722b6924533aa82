workqueue: reimplement is_chained_work() using current_wq_worker()

is_chained_work() was added before current_wq_worker() and implemented
its own ham-fisted way of finding out whether %current is a workqueue
worker - it iterates through all possible workers.

Drop the custom implementation and reimplement using
current_wq_worker().
