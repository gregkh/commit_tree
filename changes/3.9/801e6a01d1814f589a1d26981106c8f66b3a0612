ARM: kirkwood: add missing include for nsa310

Patch 92cb7625 "ARM: kirkwood: nsa310: cleanup includes and
unneeded code" was a little too quick, since there is still
an I2C_BOARD_INFO left in this file at the moment. Once
that is gone and replaced by a DT description of the devices,
the inclusion can be removed again

Without this patch, building kirkwood_defconfig results in:

arch/arm/mach-kirkwood/board-nsa310.c:42:74: error: array type has incomplete element type
