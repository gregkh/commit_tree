MODSIGN: Add option to not sign modules during modules_install

To allow the builder to sign only a subset of modules, or to sign the
modules using a key that is not available on the build machine, add
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_ALL. If this option is unset, no modules will be
signed during build. The default is 'y', to preserve the current
behavior.
