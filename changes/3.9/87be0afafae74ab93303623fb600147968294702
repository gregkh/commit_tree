staging/xgifb: Remove unused values in XGI340_cr41 and XGI27_cr41

In the lookup tables XGI340_cr41 and XGI27_cr41 only the first three
values are used of each 'line', thus the remaining fields can be
removed.

Rationale:
- vb_init.c uses pVBInfo->ram_type for the 'column' index for
pVBInfo->CR40.

- pVBInfo->ram_type is assigned the return value of
  XGINew_GetXG20DRAMType which can only be 0, 1 or 2

- pVBInfo->CR40 is assigned to either XGI340_cr41 or XGI27_cr41 in
vb_setmode.c

-> only the first three values are used.
This becomes also evident as values 3-7 are all 0.
