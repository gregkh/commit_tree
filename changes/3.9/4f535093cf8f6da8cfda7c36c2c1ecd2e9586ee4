PCI: Put pci_dev in device tree as early as possible

We want to put pci_dev structs in the device tree as soon as possible so
for_each_pci_dev() iteration will not miss them, but driver attachment
needs to be delayed until after pci_assign_unassigned_resources() to make
sure all devices have resources assigned first.

This patch moves device registering from pci_bus_add_devices() to
pci_device_add(), which happens earlier, leaving driver attachment in
pci_bus_add_devices().

It also removes unattached child bus handling in pci_bus_add_devices().
That's not needed because child bus via pci_add_new_bus() is already
in parent bus children list.
