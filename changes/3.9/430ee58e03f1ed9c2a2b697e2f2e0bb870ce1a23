usb/core: update power budget for SuperSpeed

Sarah pointed out that the USB3.0 spec also updates the amount of power
that may be consumed by the device and quoted 9.2.5.1:

|"The amount of current draw for SuperSpeed devices are increased to 150
|mA for low-power devices and 900 mA for high-power"

This patch tries to update all users to use the larger values for
SuperSpeed devices and use the "old" ones for everything else.

While here, two other changes suggested by Alan:
- the comment referering to 7.2.1.1 has been updated to 7.2.1 which is
  the correct source of the action.
- the check for hubs with zero ports has been removed.
- compute bus power by full_load * num_ports on root hubs
