kgdb: remove #include <linux/serial_8250.h> from kgdb.h

There's no reason kgdb.h itself needs to include the 8250 serial port
header file.  So push it down to the _very_ limited number of individual
drivers that need the values in that file, and fix up the places where
people really wanted serial_core.h and platform_device.h.
