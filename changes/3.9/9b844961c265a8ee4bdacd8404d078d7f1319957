mmc: core: fix permanent sleep of mmcqd during card removal

This patch is derived from:
"mmc: fix async request mechanism for sequential read scenarios".

According as async transfer, a request is handled with twice mmc_start_req.
When the card is removed, the request is actually not issued in the first
mmc_start_req [__mmc_start_data_req]. And then mmc_wait_for_data_req_done
will come in the next mmc_start_req. But there is no event for completions.
wake_up_interruptible is needed in __mmc_start_data_req for the case of
removed card.
