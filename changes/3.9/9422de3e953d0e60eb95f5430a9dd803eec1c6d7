powerpc: Hardware breakpoints rewrite to handle non DABR breakpoint registers

This is a rewrite so that we don't assume we are using the DABR throughout the
code.  We now use the arch_hw_breakpoint to store the breakpoint in a generic
manner in the thread_struct, rather than storing the raw DABR value.

The ptrace GET/SET_DEBUGREG interface currently passes the raw DABR in from
userspace.  We keep this functionality, so that future changes (like the POWER8
DAWR), will still fake the DABR to userspace.
