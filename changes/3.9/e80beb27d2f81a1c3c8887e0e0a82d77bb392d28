gpio: Make of_count_named_gpios() use new of_count_phandle_with_args()

This patch replaces the horribly coded of_count_named_gpios() with a
call to of_count_phandle_with_args() which is far more efficient. This
also changes the return value of of_gpio_count() & of_gpio_named_count()
from 'unsigned int' to 'int' so that it can return an error code. All
the users of that function are fixed up to correctly handle a negative
return value.

v2: Split GPIO portion into a separate patch
