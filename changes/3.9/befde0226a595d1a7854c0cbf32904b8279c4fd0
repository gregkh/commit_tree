HID: uhid: make creating devices work on 64/32 systems

Unfortunately UHID interface, as it was introduced, is broken with 32 bit
userspace running on 64 bit kernels as it uses a pointer in its userspace
facing API.

Fix it by checking if we are executing compat task and munge the request
appropriately.
