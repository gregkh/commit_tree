staging/comedi: Fix undefined array subscript

In vmk80xx_do_insn_bits the local variable reg, which is used as an
index to the tx_buf array, can be used uninitialized if
- data[0] == 0
and
- devpriv->model != VMK8061_MODEL
-> we get into the else branch without having reg initialized.

Since the driver usually differentiates between VMK8061_MODEL and
VMK8055_MODEL it's safe to assume that VMK8055_DO_REG was meant as an
initial value.

And to avoid duplication we can move the assignments to the top.
