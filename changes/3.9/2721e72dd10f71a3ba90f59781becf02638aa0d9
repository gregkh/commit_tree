tracing: Fix race in snapshot swapping

Although the swap is wrapped with a spin_lock, the assignment
of the temp buffer used to swap is not within that lock.
It needs to be moved into that lock, otherwise two swaps
happening on two different CPUs, can end up using the wrong
temp buffer to assign in the swap.

Luckily, all current callers of the swap function appear to have
their own locks. But in case something is added that allows two
different callers to call the swap, then there's a chance that
this race can trigger and corrupt the buffers.

New code is coming soon that will allow for this race to trigger.

I've Cc'd stable, so this bug will not show up if someone backports
one of the changes that can trigger this bug.
