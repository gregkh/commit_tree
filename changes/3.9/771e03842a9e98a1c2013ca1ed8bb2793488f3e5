ring-buffer: Remove unnecessary recusive call in rb_advance_iter()

The original ring-buffer code had special checks at the start
of rb_advance_iter() and instead of repeating them again at the
end of the function if a certain condition existed, I just did
a recursive call to rb_advance_iter() because the special condition
would cause rb_advance_iter() to return early (after the checks).

But as things have changed, the special checks no longer exist
and the only thing done for the special_condition is to call
rb_inc_iter() and return. Instead of doing a confusing recursive call,
just call rb_inc_iter instead.
