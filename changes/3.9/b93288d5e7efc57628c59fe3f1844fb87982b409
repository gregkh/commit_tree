bnx2x: Support of PF driver of a VF init request

The VF driver will send an 'init' request as part of its nic load
flow. This message is used by the VF to publish the GPA's of its
status blocks, slow path ring and statistics buffer.
The PF driver notes all this down in the VF database, and also uses
this message to transfer the VF to VF_INIT state internally.
