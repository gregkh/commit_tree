x86: Add TS-5500 platform support

The Technologic Systems TS-5500 is an x86-based (AMD Elan SC520)
single board computer. This driver registers most of its devices
and exposes sysfs attributes for information such as jumpers'
state or presence of some of its options.

This driver currently registers the TS-5500 platform, its
on-board LED, 2 pin blocks (GPIO) and its analog/digital
converter. It can be extended to support other Technologic
Systems products, such as the TS-5600.
