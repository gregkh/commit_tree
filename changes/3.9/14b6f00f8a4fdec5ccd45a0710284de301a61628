pseries/iommu: Remove DDW on kexec

pseries/iommu: remove DDW on kexec

We currently insert a property in the device-tree when we successfully
configure DDW for a given slot. This was meant to be an optimization to
speed up kexec/kdump, so that we don't need to make the RTAS calls again
to re-configured DDW in the new kernel.

However, we end up tripping a plpar_tce_stuff failure on kexec/kdump
because we unconditionally parse the ibm,dma-window property for the
node at bus/dev setup time. This property contains the 32-bit DMA window
LIOBN, which is distinct from the DDW window's. We pass that LIOBN (via
iommu_table_init -> iommu_table_clear -> tce_free ->
tce_freemulti_pSeriesLP) to plpar_tce_stuff, which fails because that
32-bit window is no longer present after
25ebc45b93452d0bc60271f178237123c4b26808 ("powerpc/pseries/iommu: remove
default window before attempting DDW manipulation").

I believe the simplest, easiest-to-maintain fix is to just change our
initcall to, rather than detecting and updating the new kernel's DDW
knowledge, just remove all DDW configurations. When the drivers
re-initialize, we will set everything back up as it was before.
