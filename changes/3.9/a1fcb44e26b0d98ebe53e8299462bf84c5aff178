ARM: KVM: vgic: retire queued, disabled interrupts

An interrupt may have been disabled after being made pending on the
CPU interface (the classic case is a timer running while we're
rebooting the guest - the interrupt would kick as soon as the CPU
interface gets enabled, with deadly consequences).

The solution is to examine already active LRs, and check the
interrupt is still enabled. If not, just retire it.
