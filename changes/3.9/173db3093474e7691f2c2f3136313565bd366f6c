sunrpc: silence build warning in gss_fill_context

Since commit 620038f6d23, gcc is throwing the following warning:

  CC [M]  net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss.o
In file included from include/linux/sunrpc/types.h:14:0,
                 from include/linux/sunrpc/sched.h:14,
                 from include/linux/sunrpc/clnt.h:18,
                 from net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss.c:45:
net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss.c: In function ‘gss_pipe_downcall’:
include/linux/sunrpc/debug.h:45:10: warning: ‘timeout’ may be used
uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
    printk(KERN_DEFAULT args); \
          ^
net/sunrpc/auth_gss/auth_gss.c:194:15: note: ‘timeout’ was declared here
  unsigned int timeout;
               ^
If simple_get_bytes returns an error, then we'll end up calling printk
with an uninitialized timeout value. Reasonably harmless, but fairly
simple to fix by removing the printout of the uninitialised parameters.
