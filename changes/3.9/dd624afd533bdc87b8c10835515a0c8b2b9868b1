drm/i915: Add a debug interface to forcibly evict and shrink our object caches

As a means to investigate some bad system behaviour related to the
purging of the active, inactive and unbound lists, it is useful to be
able to manually control when those lists should be cleared.

v2: use _safe list iterators as we kick objects from the list as we
walk.

wait for gpu resets, acked by Chris on irc.]
