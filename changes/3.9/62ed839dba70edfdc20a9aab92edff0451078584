gianfar: fix compile fail for NET_POLL=y due to struct packing

Commit ee873fda3bec7c668407b837fc5519eb961fcd37 ("gianfar: Pack struct
gfar_priv_grp into three cachelines") moved the irq number and names
off into a separate struct and created accessors for them.  However
it was never tested with NET_POLL enabled, and so some conversions
that were simply overlooked went undetected until now.

Make the netpoll ones also use the gfar_irq() accessors.
