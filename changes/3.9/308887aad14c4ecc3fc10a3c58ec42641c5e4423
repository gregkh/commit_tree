drm/i915: fix reset handling in the throttle ioctl

While auditing the code I've noticed one place (the throttle ioctl)
which does not yet wait for the reset handler to complete and doesn't
properly decode the wedge state into -EAGAIN/-EIO. Fix this up by
calling the right helpers. This might explain the oddball "my
compositor just died in a successfull gpu reset" reports. Or maybe not, since
current mesa doesn't use this ioctl to throttle command submission.

The throttle ioctl doesn't take the struct_mutex, so to avoid busy-looping
with -EAGAIN while a reset is in process, check for errors first and wait
for the handler to complete if a reset is pending by calling
i915_gem_wait_for_error.
