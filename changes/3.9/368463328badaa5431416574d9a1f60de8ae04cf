staging: comedi: addi_apci_16xx: separate from addi_common.c

This driver is for two simple ttl digital output boards. One with
48 channels the other with 96. Using the addi-data "common" code
introduces a lot of bloat.

Copy the code in addi_common.c to this driver and remove the #include
that caused addi_common.c to be compiled with this driver. This will
allow removing the bloat.

Rename the auto_attach and detach functions so they have namespace
associated with this driver.
