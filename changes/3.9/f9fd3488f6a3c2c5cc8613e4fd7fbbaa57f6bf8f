sparc32: refactor smp boot

Introduce a common smp_callin() function to call
from trampoline_32.S.
Add platform specific functions to handle the
platform details.

This is in preparation for a patch that will
unify the smp boot stuff for all architectures.
sparc32 was significantly different to warrant
this patch in preparation.
