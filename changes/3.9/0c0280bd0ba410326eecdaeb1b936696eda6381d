wireless: make the reg_notifier() void

The reg_notifier()'s return value need not be checked
as it is only supposed to do post regulatory work and
that should never fail. Any behaviour to regulatory
that needs to be considered before cfg80211 does work
to a driver should be specified by using the already
existing flags, the reg_notifier() just does post
processing should it find it needs to.

Also make lbs_reg_notifier static.
