net: introduce skb_transport_header_was_set()

We have skb_mac_header_was_set() helper to tell if mac_header
was set on a skb. We would like the same for transport_header.

__netif_receive_skb() doesn't reset the transport header if already
set by GRO layer.

Note that network stacks usually reset the transport header anyway,
after pulling the network header, so this change only allows
a followup patch to have more precise qdisc pkt_len computation
for GSO packets at ingress side.
