metag: Memory management

Add memory management files for metag.

Meta's 32bit virtual address space is split into two halves:
 - local (0x08000000-0x7fffffff): traditionally local to a hardware
   thread and incoherent between hardware threads. Each hardware thread
   has it's own local MMU table. On Meta2 the local space can be
   globally coherent (GCOn) if the cache partitions coincide.
 - global (0x88000000-0xffff0000): coherent and traditionally global
   between hardware threads. On Meta2, each hardware thread has it's own
   global MMU table.

The low 128MiB of each half is non-MMUable and maps directly to the
physical address space:
 - 0x00010000-0x07ffffff: contains Meta core registers and maps SoC bus
 - 0x80000000-0x87ffffff: contains low latency global core memories

Linux usually further splits the local virtual address space like this:
 - 0x08000000-0x3fffffff: user mappings
 - 0x40000000-0x7fffffff: kernel mappings
