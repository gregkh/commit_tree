igb: increase timeout for ethtool offline self-test

On several machines with i350 adapters the ethtool offline self-test sometimes
fails. This happens because link auto negotiation may take longer than the
timeout of 4 seconds. Increasing the timeout by 1 seconds resolves the issue.

Output from a failing i350 offline self-test:
while [ 1 ]; do ethtool -t eth2 offline; done
The test result is PASS
The test extra info:
