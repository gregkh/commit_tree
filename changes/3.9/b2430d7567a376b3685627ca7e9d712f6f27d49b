fuse: add per-page descriptor <offset, length> to fuse_req

The ability to save page pointers along with lengths and offsets in fuse_req
will be useful to cover several iovec-s with a single fuse_req.

Per-request page_offset is removed because anybody who need it can use
req->page_descs[0].offset instead.
