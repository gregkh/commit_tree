ASoC: fsi: cleanup sh_fsi.h

FSI driver's flag usage was changed/removed by
3449f5fab8c51e37a8a48bc2516588c615373191
(ASoC: fsi: add SND_SOC_DAIFMT_INV_xxx support)
ab6f6d85210c4d0265cf48e9958c04e08595055a
(ASoC: fsi: add master clock control functions)

And unused flags had been removed on FSI driver,
but the definition had been kept to avoid compile error.

It is possible to cleanup sh_fsi.h now.
