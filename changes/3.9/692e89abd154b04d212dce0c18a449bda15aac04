memcg: increment static branch right after limit set

We were deferring the kmemcg static branch increment to a later time,
due to a nasty dependency between the cpu_hotplug lock, taken by the
jump label update, and the cgroup_lock.

Now we no longer take the cgroup lock, and we can save ourselves the
trouble.
