sunrpc: Update gss uid to security context mapping.

- Use from_kuid when generating the on the wire uid values.
- Use make_kuid when reading on the wire values.

In gss_encode_v0_msg, since the uid in gss_upcall_msg is now a kuid_t
generate the necessary uid_t value on the stack copy it into
gss_msg->databuf where it can safely live until the message is no
longer needed.
