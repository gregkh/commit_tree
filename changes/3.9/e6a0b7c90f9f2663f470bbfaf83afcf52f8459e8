s390/cio: skip broken paths

Omit known to be broken paths (those set in path_noirq_mask) for the
sense/set PGID and nop IO commands.

Note: path_noirq_mask will be reset in ccw_device_verify_start (the
paths could be healthy again). However if we restart a path
verification via verify_start this mask will not be reset (there is
no need to let the wait for an interrupt time out again - plus we
do not want to loop once we deal with the paths in unknown path group
state).
