gfs2: Remove improper checks in gfs2_set_dqblk.

In set_dqblk it is an error to look at fdq->d_id or fdq->d_flags.
Userspace quota applications do not set these fields when calling
quotactl(Q_XSETQLIM,...), and the kernel does not set those fields
when quota_setquota calls set_dqblk.

gfs2 never looks at fdq->d_id or fdq->d_flags after checking
to see if they match the id and type supplied to set_dqblk.

No other linux filesystem in set_dqblk looks at either fdq->d_id
or fdq->d_flags.

Therefore remove these bogus checks from gfs2 and allow normal
quota setting applications to work.
