power_supply: Add watchdog and safety timer expiries under PROP_HEALTH_*

As most of the charger chips come with two kinds of safety features
related to timing:

1. Watchdog Timer (interms of seconds/mins)
2. Safety Timer (interms of hours)

This patch adds these to fault causes in POWER_SUPPLY_PROP_HEALTH_* enums
so that whenever there is either watchdog timeout or safety timer timeout
driver could notify the user space accurately about the fault and will
also be helpful for debug.
