pkt_sched: sch_qfq: fix the update of eligible-group sets

Between two invocations of make_eligible, the system virtual time may
happen to grow enough that, in its binary representation, a bit with
higher order than 31 flips. This happens especially with
TSO/GSO. Before this fix, the mask used in make_eligible was computed
as (1UL<<index_of_last_flipped_bit)-1, whose value is well defined on
a 64-bit architecture, because index_of_flipped_bit <= 63, but is in
general undefined on a 32-bit architecture if index_of_flipped_bit > 31.
The fix just replaces 1UL with 1ULL.
