sanitize rt_sigaction() situation a bit

	Switch from __ARCH_WANT_SYS_RT_SIGACTION to opposite
(!CONFIG_ODD_RT_SIGACTION); the only two architectures that
need it are alpha and sparc.  The reason for use of CONFIG_...
instead of __ARCH_... is that it's needed only kernel-side
and doing it that way avoids a mess with include order on many
architectures.
