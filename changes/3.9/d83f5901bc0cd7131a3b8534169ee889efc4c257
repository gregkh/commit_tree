coda: Restrict coda messages to the initial user namespace

Remove the slight chance that uids and gids in coda messages will be
interpreted in the wrong user namespace.

- Only allow processes in the initial user namespace to open the coda
  character device to communicate with coda filesystems.
- Explicitly convert the uids in the coda header into the initial user
  namespace.
- In coda_vattr_to_attr make kuids and kgids from the initial user
  namespace uids and gids in struct coda_vattr that just came from
  userspace.
- In coda_iattr_to_vattr convert kuids and kgids into uids and gids
  in the intial user namespace and store them in struct coda_vattr for
  sending to coda userspace programs.

Nothing needs to be changed with mounts as coda does not support
being mounted in anything other than the initial user namespace.
