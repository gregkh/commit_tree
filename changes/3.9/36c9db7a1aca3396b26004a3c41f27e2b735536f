ALSA: hda - Use generic parser for STAC/IDT codec driver

Finally we reached here.  All codecs driver (except for CA0132, which
has really device-specific requirements) have been converted to use
the generic parser.

This patch appears bigger than others since it also involves with the
code shuffling, but mostly the cut-off of parser codes and adapt to
the generic parser flags.  Most of fixup codecs haven't been changed
but just removed a few unnecessary codes.

The only missing stuff is the SPDIF mux control.  It'll be added again
later.
