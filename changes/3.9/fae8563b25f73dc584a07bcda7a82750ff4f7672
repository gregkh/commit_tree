sfc: Only use TX push if a single descriptor is to be written

Using TX push when notifying the NIC of multiple new descriptors in
the ring will very occasionally cause the TX DMA engine to re-use an
old descriptor.  This can result in a duplicated or partly duplicated
packet (new headers with old data), or an IOMMU page fault.  This does
not happen when the pushed descriptor is the only one written.

TX push also provides little latency benefit when a packet requires
more than one descriptor.
