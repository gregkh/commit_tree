ARM: 7698/1: perf: fix group validation when using enable_on_exec

Events may be created with attr->disabled == 1 and attr->enable_on_exec
== 1, which confuses the group validation code because events with the
PERF_EVENT_STATE_OFF are not considered candidates for scheduling, which
may lead to failure at group scheduling time.

This patch fixes the validation check for ARM, so that events in the
OFF state are still considered when enable_on_exec is true.
