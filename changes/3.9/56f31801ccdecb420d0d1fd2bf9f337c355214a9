mm: cleanup "swapcache" in do_swap_page

I dislike the way in which "swapcache" gets used in do_swap_page():
there is always a page from swapcache there (even if maybe uncached by
the time we lock it), but tests are made according to "swapcache".
Rework that with "page != swapcache", as has been done in unuse_pte().
