powerpc: Fix setting FSCR for HV=0 and on secondary CPUs

Currently we only set the FSCR (Facility Status and Control Register) when HV=1
but this feature is available when HV=0 also.  This patch sets FSCR when HV=0.

Also, we currently only set the FSCR on the master CPU.  This patch also sets
the FSCR on secondary CPUs.
