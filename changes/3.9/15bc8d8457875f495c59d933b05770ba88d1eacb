s390/kvm: Fix store status for ACRS/FPRS

On store status we need to copy the current state of registers
into a save area. Currently we might save stale versions:
The sie state descriptor doesnt have fields for guest ACRS,FPRS,
those registers are simply stored in the host registers. The host
program must copy these away if needed. We do that in vcpu_put/load.

If we now do a store status in KVM code between vcpu_put/load, the
saved values are not up-to-date. Lets collect the ACRS/FPRS before
saving them.

This also fixes some strange problems with hotplug and virtio-ccw,
since the low level machine check handler (on hotplug a machine check
will happen) will revalidate all registers with the content of the
save area.
