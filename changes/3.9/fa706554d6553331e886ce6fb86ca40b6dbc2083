batman-adv: don't compile the BLA switch if not requested

When the Bridge Loop Avoidance component is not compiled-in, its boolean switch
should be not compiled as well. This patch surrounds the switch with a proper
ifdef.

This behaviour was introduced by 9fd6b0615b5499b270d39a92b8790e206cf75833
("batman-adv: add bridge loop avoidance compile option")
