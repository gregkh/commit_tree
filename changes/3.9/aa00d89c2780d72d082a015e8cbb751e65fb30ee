sched: do not use cpu_to_node() to find an offlined cpu's node.

If a cpu is offline, its nid will be set to -1, and cpu_to_node(cpu)
will return -1.  As a result, cpumask_of_node(nid) will return NULL.  In
this case, find_next_bit() in for_each_cpu will get a NULL pointer and
cause panic.

Here is a call trace:
  Call Trace:
   <IRQ>
    select_fallback_rq+0x71/0x190
    try_to_wake_up+0x2cb/0x2f0
    wake_up_process+0x15/0x20

    apic_timer_interrupt+0x6f/0x80

There is a hrtimer process sleeping, whose cpu has already been
offlined.  When it is waken up, it tries to find another cpu to run, and
get a -1 nid.  As a result, cpumask_of_node(-1) returns NULL, and causes
ernel panic.

This patch fixes this problem by judging if the nid is -1.  If nid is
not -1, a cpu on the same node will be picked.  Else, a online cpu on
another node will be picked.
