ARC: [Review] Multi-platform image #1: Kconfig enablement

This mini patchseries addresses the lack of multi-platform-image support
in ARC port.

Older build system only supported one platform(soc) to build at a time
and further only one board of that platform could be built. There was no
technical reason for that - we just didn't have the need.

So the first step towards multi-platform (and multi-board) builds it to
allow build system to do that.

So as applicable, <choice .. endchoice> => <menu .. endmenu>
