ARM: dove: update dove_defconfig with a few useful options

This refreshes the dove_defconfig, and adds:
PRINTK_TIME
DEVTMPFS
EXT4

They're quite useful, and allows booting a cubox ubuntu rootfs on SD card,
since that by default uses ext4.

The rest of the churn is due to options and defaults moving around, no
functional difference.
