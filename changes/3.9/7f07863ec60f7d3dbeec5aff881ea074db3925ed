ARM: OMAP: Consolidate OMAP USB-HS platform data (part 1/3)

Let's have a single platform data structure for the OMAP's High-Speed
USB host subsystem instead of having 3 separate ones i.e. one for
board data, one for USB Host (UHH) module and one for USB-TLL module.

This makes the code much simpler and avoids creating multiple copies of
platform data.

Part 1 touches platform headers
Part 2 touches drivers
Part 3 touches platform data
