staging: comedi: ni_daq_700: convert to auto attach

Convert this pcmcia driver to the comedi auto attach mechanism.

This allows getting rid of the "hack" needed to pass the pcmcia_device
pointer from the pcmcia_driver to the comedi_driver.

We can also get rid of the boardinfo since it was only used to
provide the "name" that was used with the manual attach.
