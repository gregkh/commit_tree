Revert "af_unix: dont send SCM_CREDENTIAL when dest socket is NULL"

This reverts commit 14134f6584212d585b310ce95428014b653dfaf6.

The problem that the above patch was meant to address is that af_unix
messages are not being coallesced because we are sending unnecesarry
credentials.  Not sending credentials in maybe_add_creds totally
breaks unconnected unix domain sockets that wish to send credentails
to other sockets.

In practice this break some versions of udev because they receive a
message and the sending uid is bogus so they drop the message.
