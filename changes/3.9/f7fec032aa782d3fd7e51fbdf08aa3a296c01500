ext4: track all extent status in extent status tree

By recording the phycisal block and status, extent status tree is able
to track the status of every extents.  When we call _map_blocks
functions to lookup an extent or create a new written/unwritten/delayed
extent, this extent will be inserted into extent status tree.

We don't load all extents from disk in alloc_inode() because it costs
too much memory, and if a file is opened and closed frequently it will
takes too much time to load all extent information.  So currently when
we create/lookup an extent, this extent will be inserted into extent
status tree.  Hence, the extent status tree may not comprehensively
contain all of the extents found in the file.

Here a condition we need to take care is that an extent might contains
unwritten and delayed status simultaneously because an extent is delayed
allocated and could be allocated by fallocate.  At this time we need to
keep delayed status because later we need to update delayed reservation
space using it.
