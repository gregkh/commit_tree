ARM: 7690/1: mm: fix CONFIG_LPAE typos

CONFIG_LPAE doesn't exist: the correct option is CONFIG_ARM_LPAE, so fix
up the two typos under arch/arm/.

The fix to head.S is slightly scary, but this is just for setting up
an early io-mapping for the serial port when running on a big-endian,
LPAE system. Since these systems don't exist in the wild (at least, I
have no access to one outside of kvmtool, which doesn't provide a serial
port suitable for earlyprintk), then we can revisit the code later if it
causes any problems.
