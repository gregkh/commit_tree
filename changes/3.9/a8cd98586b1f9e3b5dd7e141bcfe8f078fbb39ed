tty: metag_da: avoid getting tty kref in dashtty_timer()

Getting the tty kref in dashtty_timer() is no longer necessary since it
isn't needed in fetch_data() any longer (due to changes which make the
tty flip functions refer to tty_ports instead of tty_structs), so just
pass around a channel number instead.
