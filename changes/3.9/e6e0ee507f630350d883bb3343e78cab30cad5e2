ALSA: hda - Fix the silent speaker output on Fujitsu S7020 laptop

In the recent update, Fujitsu S7020 laptop with ALC260 codec lost the
speaker output, no matter how the amps and the pins are set.  After a
long debugging session, we found out that the default codec init code
is harmful for this machine, and we have to reset it to
ALC_INIT_NONE.
