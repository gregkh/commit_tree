async: keep pending tasks on async_domain and remove async_pending

Async kept single global pending list and per-domain running lists.
When an async item is queued, it's put on the global pending list.
The item is moved to the per-domain running list when its execution
starts.

At this point, this design complicates execution and synchronization
without bringing any benefit.  The list only matters for
synchronization which doesn't care whether a given async item is
pending or executing.  Also, global synchronization is done by
iterating through all active registered async_domains, so the global
async_pending list doesn't help anything either.

Rename async_domain->running to async_domain->pending and put async
items directly there and remove when execution completes.  This
simplifies lowest_in_progress() a lot - the first item on the pending
list is the one with the lowest cookie, and async_run_entry_fn()
doesn't have to mess with moving the item from pending to running.

After the change, whether a domain is empty or not can be trivially
determined by looking at async_domain->pending.  Remove
async_domain->count and use list_empty() on pending instead.
