Input: tegra-kbc - require CONFIG_OF, remove platform data

Tegra only supports, and always enables, device tree. Remove all ifdefs
and runtime checks for DT support from the driver. Platform data is
therefore no longer required. Delete the header that defines it, and
rework the driver to parse the device tree directly into struct
tegra_kbc.
