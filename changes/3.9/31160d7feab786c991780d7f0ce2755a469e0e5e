perf tools: Fix GNU make v3.80 compatibility issue

According to Documentation/Changes, the kernel should be buildable with
GNU make 3.80+. tools/perf/config/utilities.mak contains the "$(or"
construct, which requires make 3.81.  This causes "make" to fail on
systems with GNU make 3.80.

Replace "$(or" with an equivalent "$(if" expression, to restore backward
compatibility. Also fix an issue where _get_attempt was called with only
one argument. This prevented the error message from printing the name of
the variable that can be used to fix the problem.
