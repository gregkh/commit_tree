ceph: kill ceph_osdc_new_request() "num_reply" parameter

The "num_reply" parameter to ceph_osdc_new_request() is never
used inside that function, so get rid of it.

Note that ceph_sync_write() passes 2 for that argument, while all
other callers pass 1.  It doesn't matter, but perhaps someone should
verify this doesn't indicate a problem.
