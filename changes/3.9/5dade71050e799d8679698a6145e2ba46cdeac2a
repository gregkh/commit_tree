tcm_vhost: Avoid VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX feature bit

This patch adds a VHOST_SCSI_FEATURES mask minus VIRTIO_RING_F_EVENT_IDX
so that vhost-scsi-pci userspace will strip this feature bit once
GET_FEATURES reports it as being unsupported on the host.

This is to avoid a bug where ->handle_kicks() are missed when EVENT_IDX
is enabled by default in userspace code.

(mst: Rename to VHOST_SCSI_FEATURES + add comment)
