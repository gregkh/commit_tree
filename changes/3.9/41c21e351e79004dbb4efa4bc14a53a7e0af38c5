userns: Changing any namespace id mappings should require privileges

Changing uid/gid/projid mappings doesn't change your id within the
namespace; it reconfigures the namespace.  Unprivileged programs should
*not* be able to write these files.  (We're also checking the privileges
on the wrong task.)

Given the write-once nature of these files and the other security
checks, this is likely impossible to usefully exploit.
