drm/i915: Reduce memory pressure during shrinker by preallocating swizzle pages

On a machine with bit17 swizzling, we need to store the bit17 of the
physical page address in put-pages. This requires a memory allocation,
on average less than a page, which may be difficult to satisfy is the
request to put-pages is on behalf of the shrinker. We could allow that
allocation to pull from the reserved memory pools, but it seems much
safer to preallocate the array for tiled objects on affected machines.

v2: Export i915_gem_object_needs_bit17_swizzle() for reuse.
