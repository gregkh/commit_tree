perf sort: Drop ip_[lr] arguments from _sort__sym_cmp()

Current _sort__sym_cmp() function is used for comparing symbols between
two hist entries on symbol, symbol_from and symbol_to sort keys.  Those
functions pass addresses of symbols but it's meaningless since it gets
over-written inside of the _sort__sym_cmp function to a start address of
the symbol.  So just get rid of them.

This might cause a difference than prior output for branch stacks since
it seems not using start address of the symbol but branch address.
However AFAICS it'd be same as it gets overwritten anyway.

Also remove redundant part of code in sort__sym_cmp().
