net: calxedaxgmac: fix rx ring handling when OOM

If skb allocation for the rx ring fails repeatedly, we can reach a point
were the ring is empty. In this condition, the driver is out of sync with
the h/w. While this has always been possible, the removal of the skb
recycling seems to have made triggering this problem easier.
