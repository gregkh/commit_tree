perf tests: Check python path on attr and binding test

Current perf test code tries to execute python version 2 in order to
test attributes on perf_event_open syscall.  However it's not default
python version anymore a system can have python v3 only or v2 with a
different name (e.g. python2).  So if there's no such python interpreter
with the name 'python', the test would fail like this (yes, it's
happened on my new archlinux laptop :).

13: struct perf_event_attr setup                 :sh: python: command not found
 FAILED!

As we can pass name of the python interpreter on make, use it for
the attr test also.
