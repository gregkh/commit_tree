pinctrl: tegra: add support for rcv-sel and drive type

NVIDIA's Tegra114 added two more configuration parameter in pinmux i.e.
rcv-sel and drive type.

rcv-sel: Select between High and Normal VIL/VIH receivers.
	RCVR_SEL=1: High VIL/VIH
	RCVR_SEL=0: Normal VIL/VIH

drv_type: Ouptput drive type:
	33-50 ohm driver: 0x1
	66-100ohm driver: 0x0

Add support of these parameters to be configure from DTS file.

Tegra20 and Tegra30 does not support this configuration and hence initialize their
pinmux structure with reg = -1.

	- remove drvtype_width as it is always 2.
	- Better describe the change.
