ARM: S5PV210: Fix PL330 DMA controller clkdev entries

Since the DMA controller clocks are managed at amba bus level, the
PL330 device clocks handling has been removed from the driver in
commit 7c71b8eb("DMA: PL330: Remove redundant runtime_suspend/
resume functions")

However, this left the S5PV210 platform with only clkdev entries
linking "apb_pclk" clock conn_id to a dummy clock, rather than
to corresponding platform PL330 DMAC clock.
As a result the DMA controller is now attempted to be used on
S5PV210 with the clock disabled and the driver fails with an
error:

dma-pl330 dma-pl330.0: PERIPH_ID 0x0, PCELL_ID 0x0 !
dma-pl330: probe of dma-pl330.0 failed with error -22
dma-pl330 dma-pl330.1: PERIPH_ID 0x0, PCELL_ID 0x0 !
dma-pl330: probe of dma-pl330.1 failed with error -22

Fix this by adding "apb_pclk" clkdev entries for the Peripheral
DMA controllers 0/1 and removing the dummy apb_pclk clock.
