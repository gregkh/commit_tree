Introduce THERMAL_TREND_RAISE_FULL and THERMAL_TREND_DROP_FULL

These two new thermal_trend types are used to tell the governor
that the temeprature is raising/dropping quickly.

Thermal cooling governors should handle this situation and make
proper decisions, e.g. set cooling state to upper/lower limit directly
instead of one step each time.
