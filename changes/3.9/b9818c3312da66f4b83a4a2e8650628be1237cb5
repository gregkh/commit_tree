powerpc: Rename set_break to avoid naming conflict

With allmodconfig we are getting:
  drivers/tty/synclink_gt.c:160:12: error: conflicting types for 'set_break'
  arch/powerpc/include/asm/debug.h:49:5: note: previous declaration of 'set_break' was here

  drivers/tty/synclinkmp.c:526:12: error: conflicting types for 'set_break'
  arch/powerpc/include/asm/debug.h:49:5: note: previous declaration of 'set_break' was here

This renames set_break to set_breakpoint to avoid this naming conflict
