[media] fix compilation with both V4L2 and I2C as 'm'

When config options are:
	CONFIG_VIDEO_DEV=y
	CONFIG_VIDEO_V4L2=m
	CONFIG_I2C=m

Compilation breaks, as reported by:
	https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=55681

Before changeset 7b34be71db533f3e0cf93d53cf62d036cdb5418a,
no compilation errors occurred. However, the I2C code there at
v4l2-device was incorrectly disabled.
