wlcore: gather information about firmware stability

It's sometimes useful to gather information about the firmware
stability in long test runs, especially to see if problems are
recurring frequently or not.  With this commit we count the number of
times a hardware recovery was issued and print it out during recovery
and in the driver_state in debugfs.
