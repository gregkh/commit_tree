Bluetooth: Move non-critical sections outside of the dev lock

This patch fixes sections of code that do not need hci_lock_dev to be
outside of the lock. Such sections include code that do not touch the
hdev at all as well as sections which just read a single byte from the
supported_features value (i.e. all lmp_*_capable() macros).
