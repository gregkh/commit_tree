ARM: tegra20: flowctrl: add support for cpu_suspend_enter/exit

The flow controller can help CPU to go into suspend mode (powered-down
state). When CPU go into powered-down state, it needs some careful
settings before getting into and after leaving. The enter and exit
functions do that by configuring appropriate mode for flow controller.
