udp: add encap_destroy callback

Users of udp encapsulation currently have an encap_rcv callback which they can
use to hook into the udp receive path.

In situations where a encapsulation user allocates resources associated with a
udp encap socket, it may be convenient to be able to also hook the proto
.destroy operation.  For example, if an encap user holds a reference to the
udp socket, the destroy hook might be used to relinquish this reference.

This patch adds a socket destroy hook into udp, which is set and enabled
in the same way as the existing encap_rcv hook.
