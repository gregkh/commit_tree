ARM: 7680/1: Detect support for SDIV/UDIV from ISAR0 register

The ISAR0 register indicates support for the SDIV and UDIV
instructions in both the Thumb and ARM instruction set. Read the
register to detect the supported instructions and update the
elf_hwcap mask as appropriate. This is better than adding more
and more cpuid checks in proc-v7.S for each new cpu variant that
supports these instructions.
