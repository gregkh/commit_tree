rbd: define flags field, use it for exists flag

Define a new rbd device flags field, manipulated using bit
operations.  Replace the use of the current "exists" flag with a bit
in this new "flags" field.  Add a little commentary about the
"exists" flag, which does not need to be manipulated atomically.
