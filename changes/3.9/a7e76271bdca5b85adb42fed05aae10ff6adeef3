ALSA: hda/ca0132: Add DSP mixer controls and helpers

This patch adds the kcontrols for the DSP effects, playback and recording
source selection.
ca0132_is_vnode_effective() checks whether virtual node settings have
taken effect.
The control change helpers ca0132_pe_switch_set(), ca0132_voicefx_set()
and ca0132_cvoice_switch_set() are added to toggle playback / capture
DSP effects, ca0132_voicefx_info(), _get() and _put() are added for
input path DSP effect value access. The volume helpers are updated to
volume_info(), _get() and _set() to use the virtual nodes.
The redundant headphone and speaker switches and ct_extension function
are removed.
