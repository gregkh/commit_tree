libceph: kill ceph_osdc_wait_event()

There are no actual users of ceph_osdc_wait_event().  This would
have been one-shot events, but we no longer support those so just
get rid of this function.

Since this leaves nothing else that waits for the completion of an
event, we can get rid of the completion in a struct ceph_osd_event.
