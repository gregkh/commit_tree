net/ipv4: Ensure that location of timestamp option is stored

This is needed in order to detect if the timestamp option appears
more than once in a packet, to remove the option if the packet is
fragmented, etc. My previous change neglected to store the option
location when the router addresses were prespecified and Pointer >
Length. But now the option location is also stored when Flag is an
unrecognized value, to ensure these option handling behaviors are
still performed.
