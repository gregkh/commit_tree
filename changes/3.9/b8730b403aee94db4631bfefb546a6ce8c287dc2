iwlwifi: dvm: fix the passive-no-RX workaround

Alex Romosan reported that since the mac80211 changes in
"mac80211: start auth/assoc timeout on frame status" and
the subsequent fixes in "mac80211: fix auth/assoc timeout
handling" (commits 1672c0e31917 and 89afe614c0c) there's
sometimes an issue connecting to a 5 GHz network with the
iwlwifi DVM driver.

The reason appears to be that since these commits any bad
TX status makes mac80211 immediately try again, causing
all of the authentication attempts to be quickly rejected
by the firmware as it hasn't heard a beacon yet. Before,
it would wait for the timeout regardless of status.

To fix this, invoke the passive-no-RX workaround when not
associated yet as well. This will cause the first frame
to get lost, but then the driver will stop the queues and
the second attempt will only be transmitted after hearing
a beacon, thus delaying it appropriately to not make the
firmware reject it again.
