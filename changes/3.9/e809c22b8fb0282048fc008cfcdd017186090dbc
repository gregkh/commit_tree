goldfish: add the goldfish virtual bus

This imports the current Google code and cleans it up slightly to use pr_ and
to properly request its resources.

Goldfish is an emulator used for Android development. It has a virtual bus where
the emulator passes platform device information to the guest which then creates
the appropriate devices.

This part of the emulation is not architecture specific so should not be hiding
in architecture trees as it does in the Google Android tree. The constants it
uses do depend on the platform and the platform creates the bus device which then
talks to the emulator to ascertain the actual devices present.
