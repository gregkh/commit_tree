ALSA: usb-audio: fix endianness bug in snd_nativeinstruments_*

The usb_control_msg() function expects __u16 types and performs
the endianness conversions by itself.
However, in three places, a conversion is performed before it is
handed over to usb_control_msg(), which leads to a double conversion
(= no conversion):
* snd_usb_nativeinstruments_boot_quirk()
* snd_nativeinstruments_control_get()
* snd_nativeinstruments_control_put()
