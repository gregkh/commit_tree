clocksource: time-armada-370-xp: add local timer support

On the SOCs Armada 370 and Armada XP, each CPU comes with two private
timers. This patch use the timer 0 of each CPU as local timer for the
clockevent if CONFIG_LOCAL_TIMER is selected. In the other case, use
only the private Timer 0 of CPU 0.
