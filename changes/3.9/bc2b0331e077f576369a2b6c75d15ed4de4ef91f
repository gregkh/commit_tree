X86: Handle Hyper-V vmbus interrupts as special hypervisor interrupts

interrupts. I would like to thank Jan Beulich <JBeulich@suse.com> and
Thomas Gleixner <tglx@linutronix.de>, for their help.

In this version of the patch, based on the feedback, I have merged the IDT

based on Jan's feedback I have added the necessary compilation switches.
