dm kcopyd: introduce configurable throttling

This patch allows the administrator to reduce the rate at which kcopyd
issues I/O.

Each module that uses kcopyd acquires a throttle parameter that can be
set in /sys/module/*/parameters.

We maintain a history of kcopyd usage by each module in the variables
io_period and total_period in struct dm_kcopyd_throttle. The actual
kcopyd activity is calculated as a percentage of time equal to
"(100 * io_period / total_period)".  This is compared with the user-defined
throttle percentage threshold and if it is exceeded, we sleep.
