ioatdma: fix race between updating ioat->head and IOAT_COMPLETION_PENDING

There is a race that can hit during __cleanup() when the ioat->head pointer is
incremented during descriptor submission. The __cleanup() can clear the
PENDING flag when it does not see any active descriptors. This causes new
submitted descriptors to be ignored because the COMPLETION_PENDING flag is
cleared. This was introduced when code was adapted from ioatdma v1 to ioatdma
v2. For v2 and v3, IOAT_COMPLETION_PENDING flag will be abandoned and a new
flag IOAT_CHAN_ACTIVE will be utilized. This flag will also be protected under
the prep_lock when being modified in order to avoid the race.
