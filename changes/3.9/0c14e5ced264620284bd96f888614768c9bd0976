bnx2x: Fix status blocks configuration

This fixes 2 issues regarding bnx2x's status blocks:

   1. ethtool -c caused corruption of status blocks in FW RAM.

   2. when using multi-CoS, the configuration of the timeout values of
      status blocks is incorrect, harming the coalescing of interrupts
      for such CoSs.
