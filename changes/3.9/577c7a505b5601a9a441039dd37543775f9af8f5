drm/i915/dp: Log the DPCD only if we have successfully retrieved one

Moving the DPCD just after a successful read will allow to:
  - log all DPCD reads (eDP ones, changes signalled by HPD IRQ)
  - don't log it if we haven't been able to read it

v2: Be sure to log the DPCD when a downstream port does not have HPD
    support and the branch device asserts HPD (Jani Nikula)
