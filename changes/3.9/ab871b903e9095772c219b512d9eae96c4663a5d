ceph: Translate inode uid and gid attributes to/from kuids and kgids.

- In fill_inode() transate uids and gids in the initial user namespace
  into kuids and kgids stored in inode->i_uid and inode->i_gid.

- In ceph_setattr() if they have changed convert inode->i_uid and
  inode->i_gid into initial user namespace uids and gids for
  transmission.
