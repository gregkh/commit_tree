ath9k: fix column header comments for some initval arrays

Some 3-column initval arrays have wrong comments. The
column of these arrays is indexed by the 'freqIndex'
variable in 'ar5008_hw_process_ini' which only depends
on the actual band.

The 'initvals' tool from 'qca-swiss-army-knife' prints
the correct comment lines for these arrays, since commit
'atheros-initvals: fix comments for non-fastclock 3-column tables'
however the comments were not refreshed in ath9k.

The patch contains no functional changes.
