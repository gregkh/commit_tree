net: fix incorrect credentials passing

Commit 257b5358b32f ("scm: Capture the full credentials of the scm
sender") changed the credentials passing code to pass in the effective
uid/gid instead of the real uid/gid.

Obviously this doesn't matter most of the time (since normally they are
the same), but it results in differences for suid binaries when the wrong
uid/gid ends up being used.

This just undoes that (presumably unintentional) part of the commit.
