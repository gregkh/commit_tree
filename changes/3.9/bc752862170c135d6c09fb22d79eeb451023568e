drm/i915: Handle untiled planes when computing their offsets

We trim the fb to fit the CRTC by computing the offset of that CRTC to
its nearest tile_row origin. This allows us to use framebuffers that are
larger than the CRTC limits without additional work.

However, we failed to compute the offset for a linear framebuffer
correctly as we treated its x-advance in whole tiles (instead of the
linear increment expected), leaving the CRTC misaligned with its
contents.

Fixes regression from commit c2c75131244507c93f812862fdbd4f3a37139401
