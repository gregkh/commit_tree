ARM: KVM: Keep track of currently running vcpus

When an interrupt occurs for the guest, it is sometimes necessary
to find out which vcpu was running at that point.

Keep track of which vcpu is being run in kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run(),
and allow the data to be retrieved using either:
- kvm_arm_get_running_vcpu(): returns the vcpu running at this point
  on the current CPU. Can only be used in a non-preemptible context.
- kvm_arm_get_running_vcpus(): returns the per-CPU variable holding
  the running vcpus, usable for per-CPU interrupts.
