vfs: Revert spurious fix to spinning prevention in prune_icache_sb

Revert commit 62a3ddef6181 ("vfs: fix spinning prevention in prune_icache_sb").

This commit doesn't look right: since we are looking at the tail of the
list (sb->s_inode_lru.prev) if we want to skip an inode, we should put
it back at the head of the list instead of the tail, otherwise we will
keep spinning on it.

Discovered when investigating why prune_icache_sb came top in perf
reports of a swapping load.
