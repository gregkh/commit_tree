fuse: allow control of adaptive readdirplus use

For some filesystems (e.g. GlusterFS), the cost of performing a
normal readdir and readdirplus are identical.  Since adaptively
using readdirplus has no benefit for those systems, give
users/filesystems the option to control adaptive readdirplus use.

v2 of this patch incorporates Miklos's suggestion to simplify the code,
as well as improving consistency of macro names and documentation.
