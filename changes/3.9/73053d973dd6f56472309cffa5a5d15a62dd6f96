ARM: highbank: fix cache flush ordering for cpu hotplug

The L1 data cache flush needs to be after highbank_set_cpu_jump call which
pollutes the cache with the l2x0_lock. This causes other cores to deadlock
waiting for the l2x0_lock. Moving the flush of the entire data cache after
highbank_set_cpu_jump fixes the problem. Use flush_cache_louis instead of
flush_cache_all are that is sufficient to flush only the L1 data cache.
flush_cache_louis did not exist when highbank_cpu_die was originally
written.

With PL310 errata 769419 enabled, a wmb is inserted into idle which takes
the l2x0_lock. This makes the problem much more easily hit and causes
reset to hang.
