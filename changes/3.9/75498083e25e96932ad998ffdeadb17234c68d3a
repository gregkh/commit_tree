ARM: imx35 Bugfix admux clock

The admux clock seems to be the audmux clock as tests show. audmux does
not work without this clock enabled. Currently imx35 does not register a
clock device for audmux. This patch adds this registration. imx-audmux
driver already handles a clock device, so no changes are necessary
there.
