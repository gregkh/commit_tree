drm/i915: rip out pre-production ilk cpu edp w/a

While reading docs I've noticed that this special workaround to select
the 1.6 GHz DP clock only applies to pre-production ilk machines.
Since the registers we're touching here are rather undocumented and
might be harmful on later chips, rip it out.

For the Bspec reference of this w/a look in "vol4g CPU Display
Registers [DevILK]", Section 4.1.7.1 "DP_Aâ€”DisplayPort A
Control Register", "DP_PLL_Frequency_Select".

v2: Keep a debug message as a hint in case something regresses.
