mm: don't wait on congested zones in balance_pgdat()

From: Zlatko Calusic <zlatko.calusic@iskon.hr>

Commit 92df3a723f84 ("mm: vmscan: throttle reclaim if encountering too
many dirty pages under writeback") introduced waiting on congested zones
based on a sane algorithm in shrink_inactive_list().

What this means is that there's no more need for throttling and
additional heuristics in balance_pgdat().  So, let's remove it and tidy
up the code.
