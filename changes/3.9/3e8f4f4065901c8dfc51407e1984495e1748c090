[SCSI] storvsc: avoid usage of WRITE_SAME

Set scsi_device->no_write_same because the host does not support it.
Also blacklist WRITE_SAME to avoid (and log) accident usage.

If the guest uses the ext4 filesystem, storvsc hangs while it prints
these messages in an endless loop:
...
[  161.459523] hv_storvsc vmbus_0_1: cmd 0x41 scsi status 0x2 srb status 0x6
[  161.462157] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda]
[  161.463135] Sense Key : No Sense [current]
[  161.464983] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda]
[  161.465899] Add. Sense: No additional sense information
[  161.468211] hv_storvsc vmbus_0_1: cmd 0x41 scsi status 0x2 srb status 0x6
[  161.475766] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda]
[  161.476728] Sense Key : No Sense [current]
[  161.478284] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda]
[  161.479441] Add. Sense: No additional sense information
...

This happens with a guest running on Windows Server 2012, but happens to
work while running on Windows Server 2008. WRITE_SAME isnt really
supported by both versions, so disable the command usage globally.
