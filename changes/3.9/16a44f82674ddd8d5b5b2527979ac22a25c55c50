cpufreq: TEGRA: Set policy->cpus from driver->init()

For multicore SoC's, with cores sharing clock line, we are required to set
policy->cpus and policy->related_cpus with mask of cpus.

With following patch, we need to set policy->cpus with mask of all possible cpus
and policy->related_cpus would be filled automatically by the cpufreq core.

    cpufreq: Simplify cpufreq_add_dev()

Current Tegra driver fills only ->related_cpus and not ->cpus, which looks to be
incorrect. Lets fix it.
