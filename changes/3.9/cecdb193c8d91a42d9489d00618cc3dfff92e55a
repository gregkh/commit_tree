ACPI / scan: Change the implementation of acpi_bus_trim()

The current acpi_bus_trim() implementation is not really
straightforward and may be simplified significantly by using
acpi_walk_namespace() with acpi_bus_remove() as a post-order
callback.

Observe that acpi_bus_remove(), as called by acpi_bus_trim(), cannot
actually fail, because its first argument is guaranteed not to be
NULL thanks to the acpi_bus_get_device() check in acpi_bus_trim(),
so simply move the acpi_bus_get_device() check to acpi_bus_remove()
and use acpi_walk_namespace() to execute it for every device under
start->handle as a post-order callback.  The, run it directly for
start->handle itself.
