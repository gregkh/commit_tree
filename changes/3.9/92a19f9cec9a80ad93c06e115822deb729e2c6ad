TTY: switch tty_insert_flip_char

Now, we start converting tty buffer functions to actually use
tty_port. This will allow us to get rid of the need of tty in many
call sites. Only tty_port will needed and hence no more
tty_port_tty_get in those paths.

tty_insert_flip_char is the next one to proceed. This one is used all
over the code, so the patch is huge.
