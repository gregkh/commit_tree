x86, cpu, amd: Fix WC+ workaround for older virtual hosts

The WC+ workaround for F10h introduces a new MSR and kvm host #GPs
on accesses to unknown MSRs if paravirt is not compiled in. Use the
exception-handling MSR accessors so as not to break 3.8 and later guests
booting on older hosts.

Remove a redundant family check while at it.
