uprobes/tracing: Fully initialize uprobe_trace_consumer before uprobe_register()

probe_event_enable() does uprobe_register() and only after that sets
utc->tu and tu->consumer/flags. This can race with uprobe_dispatcher()
which can miss these assignments or see them out of order. Nothing
really bad can happen, but this doesn't look clean/safe.

And this does not allow to use uprobe_consumer->filter() we are going
to add, it is called by uprobe_register() and it needs utc->tu.

Change this code to initialize everything before uprobe_register(), and
reset tu->consumer/flags if it fails. We can't race with event_disable(),
the caller holds event_mutex, and if we could the code would be wrong
anyway.

In fact I think uprobe_trace_consumer should die, it buys nothing but
complicates the code. We can simply add uprobe_consumer into trace_uprobe.
