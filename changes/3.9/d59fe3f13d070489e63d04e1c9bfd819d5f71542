ix86: Tighten asmlinkage_protect() constraints

While the description of the commit that originally introduced
asmlinkage_protect() validly says that this doesn't guarantee
clobbering of the function arguments, using "m" constraints
rather than "g" ones reduces the risk (by making it less
attractive to the compiler to move those variables into
registers) and generally results in better code (because we know
the arguments are in memory anyway, and are frequently - if not
always - used just once, with the second [compiler visible] use
in asmlinkage_protect() itself being a fake one).
