ext4: start handle at the last possible moment when creating inodes

In ext4_{create,mknod,mkdir,symlink}(), don't start the journal handle
until the inode has been succesfully allocated.  In order to do this,
we need to start the handle in the ext4_new_inode().  So create a new
variant of this function, ext4_new_inode_start_handle(), so the handle
can be created at the last possible minute, before we need to modify
the inode allocation bitmap block.
