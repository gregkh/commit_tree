ALSA: hda - Manage current pinctl values in generic parser

Use the new pin target accessors for managing the current pinctl
values in the generic parser.  The pinctl values of all active pins
are once determined at the initialization phase, and stored via
snd_hda_codec_set_pin_target().  This will be referred again in the
codec init or resume phase to set the actual pinctl.

This value is kept while the auto-mute.  When a line-out or a speaker
pin is muted by auto-mute, the driver simply disables the pin, but it
doesn't touch the cached pinctl target value.  Upon unmute, this value
is used to restore the original pinctl in return.
