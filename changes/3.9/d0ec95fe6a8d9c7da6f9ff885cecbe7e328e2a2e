Commit 57e5c63007955838043e34c732d224b2cbbb128f "emu10k1: allow to
 disable the SRC" force hardware use only one rate (48000 hz).
EMU 0404/1010/1616 have support two hardware sampling rates (44100 and
48000 hz). This patch add check if we have EMU 0404/1010/1616 and
choose correct sample rate to restrict.
