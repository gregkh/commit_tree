cfg80211: disallow more station changes

The following changes are invalid and should be
disallowed when a station already exists:
 * supported rates changes, except for TDLS peers
 * listen interval changes
 * HT capability changes

Disallow them and also update a mac80211 comment
explaining how they would be racy.
