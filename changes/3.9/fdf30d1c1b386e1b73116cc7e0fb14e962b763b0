Btrfs: limit the global reserve to 512mb

A user reported a problem where he was getting early ENOSPC with hundreds of
gigs of free data space and 6 gigs of free metadata space.  This is because the
global block reserve was taking up the entire free metadata space.  This is
ridiculous, we have infrastructure in place to throttle if we start using too
much of the global reserve, so instead of letting it get this huge just limit it
to 512mb so that users can still get work done.  This allowed the user to
complete his rsync without issues.  Thanks
