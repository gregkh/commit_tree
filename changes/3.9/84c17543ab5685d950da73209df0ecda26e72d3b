ext4: move work from io_end to inode

It does not make much sense to have struct work in ext4_io_end_t
because we always use it for only one ext4_io_end_t per inode (the
first one in the i_completed_io list). So just move the structure to
inode itself.  This also allows for a small simplification in
processing io_end structures.
