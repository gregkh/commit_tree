workqueue: move global_cwq->cpu to worker_pool

Move gcwq->cpu to pool->cpu.  This introduces a couple places where
gcwq->pools[0].cpu is used.  These will soon go away as gcwq is
further reduced.

This is part of an effort to remove global_cwq and make worker_pool
the top level abstraction, which in turn will help implementing worker
pools with user-specified attributes.
