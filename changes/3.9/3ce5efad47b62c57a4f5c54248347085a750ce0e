netrom: fix info leak via msg_name in nr_recvmsg()

In case msg_name is set the sockaddr info gets filled out, as
requested, but the code fails to initialize the padding bytes of
struct sockaddr_ax25 inserted by the compiler for alignment. Also
the sax25_ndigis member does not get assigned, leaking four more
bytes.

Both issues lead to the fact that the code will leak uninitialized
kernel stack bytes in net/socket.c.

Fix both issues by initializing the memory with memset(0).
