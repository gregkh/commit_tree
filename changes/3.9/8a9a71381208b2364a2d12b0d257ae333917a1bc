libfc, fcoe, bnx2fc: Always use fcoe_disc_init for discovery layer initialization

Currently libfcoe is doing some libfc discovery layer initialization outside of
libfc. This patch moves this code into libfc and sets up a split in discovery
(one time) initialization code and (re-configurable) settings that will come in
the next patch.
