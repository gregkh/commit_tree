pwm: atmel: add Timer Counter Block PWM driver

This patch adds a PWM driver based on Atmel Timer Counter Block. The
Timer Counter Block is used in Waveform generator mode.

A Timer Counter Block provides up to 6 PWM devices grouped by 2:
* group 0 = PWM 0 and 1
* group 1 = PWM 2 and 3
* group 2 = PMW 4 and 5

PWM devices in a given group must be configured with the same period
value. If a PWM device in a group tries to change the period value and
the other device is already configured with a different value an error
will be returned.

This driver requires device tree support. The Timer Counter Block number
used to create a PWM chip is given by the tc-block field in an
"atmel,tcb-pwm" compatible node.

This patch was tested on kizbox board (at91sam9g20 SoC) with pwm-leds.
