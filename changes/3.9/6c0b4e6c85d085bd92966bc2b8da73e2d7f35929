gpiolib: let gpio_chip reference its descriptors

Add a pointer to the gpio_chip structure that references the array of
GPIO descriptors belonging to the chip, and update gpiolib code to use
this pointer instead of the global gpio_desc[] array. This is another
step towards the removal of the gpio_desc[] global array.
