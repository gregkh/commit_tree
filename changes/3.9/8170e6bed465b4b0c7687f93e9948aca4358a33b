x86, 64bit: Use a #PF handler to materialize early mappings on demand

Linear mode (CR0.PG = 0) is mutually exclusive with 64-bit mode; all
64-bit code has to use page tables.  This makes it awkward before we
have first set up properly all-covering page tables to access objects
that are outside the static kernel range.

So far we have dealt with that simply by mapping a fixed amount of
low memory, but that fails in at least two upcoming use cases:

1. We will support load and run kernel, struct boot_params, ramdisk,
   command line, etc. above the 4 GiB mark.
2. need to access ramdisk early to get microcode to update that as
   early possible.

We could use early_iomap to access them too, but it will make code to
messy and hard to be unified with 32 bit.

Hence, set up a #PF table and use a fixed number of buffers to set up
page tables on demand.  If the buffers fill up then we simply flush
them and start over.  These buffers are all in __initdata, so it does
not increase RAM usage at runtime.

Thus, with the help of the #PF handler, we can set the final kernel
mapping from blank, and switch to init_level4_pgt later.

During the switchover in head_64.S, before #PF handler is available,
we use three pages to handle kernel crossing 1G, 512G boundaries with
sharing page by playing games with page aliasing: the same page is
mapped twice in the higher-level tables with appropriate wraparound.
The kernel region itself will be properly mapped; other mappings may
be spurious.

early_make_pgtable is using kernel high mapping address to access pages
to set page table.

-v4: Add phys_base offset to make kexec happy, and add
	init_mapping_kernel()   - Yinghai
-v5: fix compiling with xen, and add back ident level3 and level2 for xen
     also move back init_level4_pgt from BSS to DATA again.
     because we have to clear it anyway.  - Yinghai
-v6: switch to init_level4_pgt in init_mem_mapping. - Yinghai
-v7: remove not needed clear_page for init_level4_page
     it is with fill 512,8,0 already in head_64.S  - Yinghai
-v8: we need to keep that handler alive until init_mem_mapping and don't
     let early_trap_init to trash that early #PF handler.
     So split early_trap_pf_init out and move it down. - Yinghai
-v9: switchover only cover kernel space instead of 1G so could avoid
     touch possible mem holes. - Yinghai
-v11: change far jmp back to far return to initial_code, that is needed
     to fix failure that is reported by Konrad on AMD systems.  - Yinghai
