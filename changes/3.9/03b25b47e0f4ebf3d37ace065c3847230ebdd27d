scripts/link-vmlinux.sh: source variables from KCONFIG_CONFIG

Its possible to superseed the config file with KCONFIG_CONFIG and have
completely no .config in the tree. The current script is sourcing
.config in every case, so the kernel will never build succesfully. This
patch fixes that issue by sourcing KCONFIG_CONFIG instead.
