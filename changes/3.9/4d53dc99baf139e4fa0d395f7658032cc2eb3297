fuse: rework fuse_retrieve()

The patch reworks fuse_retrieve() to allocate only so many page pointers
as needed. The core part of the patch is the following calculation:

	num_pages = (num + offset + PAGE_SIZE - 1) >> PAGE_SHIFT;

(thanks Miklos for formula). All other changes are mostly shuffling lines.
