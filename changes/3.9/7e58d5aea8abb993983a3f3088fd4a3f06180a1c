virtio-net: introduce a new control to set macaddr

Currently we write MAC address to pci config space byte by byte,
this means that we have an intermediate step where mac is wrong.
This patch introduced a new control command to set MAC address,
it's atomic.

VIRTIO_NET_F_CTRL_MAC_ADDR is a new feature bit for compatibility.
