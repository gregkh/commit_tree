uprobes: Do not allocate current->utask unnecessary

handle_swbp() does get_utask() before can_skip_sstep() for no reason,
we do not need ->utask if can_skip_sstep() succeeds.

Move get_utask() to pre_ssout() who actually starts to use it. Move
the initialization of utask->active_uprobe/state as well. This way
the whole initialization is consolidated in pre_ssout().
