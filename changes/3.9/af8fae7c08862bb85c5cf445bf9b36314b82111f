mm/memory-failure.c: clean up soft_offline_page()

Currently soft_offline_page() is hard to maintain because it has many
return points and goto statements.  All of this mess come from
get_any_page().

This function should only get page refcount as the name implies, but it
does some page isolating actions like SetPageHWPoison() and dequeuing
hugepage.  This patch corrects it and introduces some internal
subroutines to make soft offlining code more readable and maintainable.
