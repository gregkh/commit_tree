perf hists browser: Convert hpp helpers to a function

The hpp helpers do same job for each field so it was implemented as
macro in order to access those fields easily.  But it gets cumbersome
to maintain a large function in a macro as the function grows. Factor
it out to a function with a little helper macro to access field.
