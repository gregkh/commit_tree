powerpc/kvm/book3s_hv: Preserve guest CFAR register value

The CFAR (Come-From Address Register) is a useful debugging aid that
exists on POWER7 processors.  Currently HV KVM doesn't save or restore
the CFAR register for guest vcpus, making the CFAR of limited use in
guests.

This adds the necessary code to capture the CFAR value saved in the
early exception entry code (it has to be saved before any branch is
executed), save it in the vcpu.arch struct, and restore it on entry
to the guest.
