mm/rmap: rename anon_vma_unlock() => anon_vma_unlock_write()

The comment in commit 4fc3f1d66b1e ("mm/rmap, migration: Make
rmap_walk_anon() and try_to_unmap_anon() more scalable") says:

| Rename anon_vma_[un]lock() => anon_vma_[un]lock_write(),
| to make it clearer that it's an exclusive write-lock in
| that case - suggested by Rik van Riel.

But that commit renames only anon_vma_lock()
