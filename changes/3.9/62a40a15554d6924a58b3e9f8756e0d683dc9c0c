    mac80211: fix idle handling sequence

broke the wireless status LED. The reason is that
we now call ieee80211_idle_off() when the channel
context is assigned, and that doesn't recalculate
the LED state. Fix this by making that function a
wrapper around most of idle recalculation while
forcing active.
