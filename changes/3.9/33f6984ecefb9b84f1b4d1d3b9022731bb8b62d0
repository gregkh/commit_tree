[media] em28xx: fix analog streaming with USB bulk transfers

With the conversion to videobuf2, some unnecessary calls of
em28xx_set_alternate() have been removed. It is now called at analog streaming
start only.
This has unveiled a bug that causes USB bulk transfers to fail with all urbs
having status -EVOERFLOW.
The reason is, that for bulk transfers usb_set_interface() needs to be called
even if the previous alt setting was the same (side note: bulk transfers seem
to work only with alt=0).
While it seems to be NOT necessary for isoc transfers, it's reasonable to just
call usb_set_interface() unconditionally in em28xx_set_alternate().
Also add a comment that explains the issue to prevent regressions in the future.
