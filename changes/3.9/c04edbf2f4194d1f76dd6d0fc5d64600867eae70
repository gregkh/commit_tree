staging: comedi: quatech_daqp_cs: convert to auto attach

Convert this pcmcia driver to the comedi auto attach mechanism.

This allows getting rid of the static data that held "A list of
"instances" of the device" that was used to pass the pcmcia_device
pointer from the pcmcia_driver to the comedi_driver.

Also, remove the now unused variables in the private data that
were used to pass the pcmcia_device.

Remove the code that pulled the model number of the card out of
the PCMCIA CIS and stashed it in the private data since it is
not used in the driver.
