drm/exynos: hdmi: support extra resolutions using drm_display_mode timings

This patch programs the core and timing generator registers using the
timing data provided in drm_display_mode and not using hard-coded
configurations.

Additional PHY configs has been added. This allows us to support more
permissible resolutions and refresh rates.
