mac80211: restrict assoc request VHT capabilities

In interoperability testing some APs showed bad behaviour
if some of the VHT capabilities of the station are better
than their own. Restrict the assoc request parameters
 - beamformee capabable,
 - RX STBC and
 - RX MCS set
to the subset that the AP can support.
