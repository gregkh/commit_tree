xen/acpi: xen memory hotplug minor updates

Dan Carpenter found current xen memory hotplug logic
has potential issue: at func acpi_memory_get_device()
*mem_device = acpi_driver_data(device);
while the device may be NULL and then dereference.

At native side, Rafael recently updated acpi_memory_get_device(),
dropping acpi_bus_add, adding lock, and avoiding above issue.

This patch updates xen memory hotplug logic accordingly, removing
redundant logic, adding lock, and avoiding dereference.
