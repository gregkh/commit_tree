perf/x86: Add Intel IvyBridge event scheduling constraints

Intel IvyBridge processor has different constraints compared
to SandyBridge. Therefore it needs its own contraint table.
This patch adds the constraint table.

Without this patch, the events listed in the patch may not be
scheduled correctly and bogus counts may be collected.
