ath9k: add spectral scan feature

Adds the spectral scan feature for ath9k. AR92xx and AR93xx chips
are supported for now. The spectral scan is triggered by configuring
a mode through a debugfs control file. Samples can be gathered via
another relay debugfs file.

Essentially, to try it out:

echo chanscan > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/spectral_scan_ctl
iw dev wlan0 scan
cat /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/spectral_scan0 > samples
echo disable > /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/phy0/ath9k/spectral_scan_ctl

This feature is still experimental.

The special "chanscan" mode is used to perform spectral scan while
mac80211 is scanning for channels. To allow this,
sw_scan_start/complete() ops have been added.

The patch contains code snippets and information from Zefir Kurtisi and
information provided by Adrian Chadd and Felix Fietkau.
