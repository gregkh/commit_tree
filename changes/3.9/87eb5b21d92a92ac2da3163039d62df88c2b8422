dm: fix limits initialization when there are no data devices

dm_calculate_queue_limits will first reset the provided limits to
defaults using blk_set_stacking_limits; whereby defeating the purpose of
retaining the original live table's limits -- as was intended via commit
3ae706561637331aa578e52bb89ecbba5edcb7a9 ("dm: retain table limits when
swapping to new table with no devices").

Fix this improper limits initialization (in the no data devices case) by
avoiding the call to dm_calculate_queue_limits.
