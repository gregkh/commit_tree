[media] em28xx: rename function em28xx_dvb_isoc_copy and extend for USB bulk transfers

The URB data processing for DVB bulk transfers is very similar to
what is done with isoc transfers, so create a common function that
works with both transfer types based on the existing isoc function.
Tested with device Hauppauge HVR-930c.
