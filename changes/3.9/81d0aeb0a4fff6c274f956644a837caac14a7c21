qlcnic: flash template based firmware reset recovery

Flash template provides instructions to stop, restart and initalize the
firmware. These instructions are abstracted as a series of read, write and
poll operations on hardware registers. Register information and operation
specifics are not exposed to the driver. Driver reads the template from
flash and executes the instructions located at pre-defined offsets.

Template based firmware reset recovery and initialization mechanism minimize
driver changes as firmware evolves.
