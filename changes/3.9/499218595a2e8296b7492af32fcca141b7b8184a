mac80211: Fix crash due to un-canceled work-items

Some mlme work structs are not cancelled on disassociation
nor interface deletion, which leads to them running after
the memory has been freed

There is not a clean way to cancel these in the disassociation
logic because they must be canceled outside of the ifmgd->mtx
lock, so just cancel them in mgd_stop logic that tears down
the station.

This fixes the crashes we see in 3.7.9+.  The crash stack
trace itself isn't so helpful, but this warning gives
more useful info:
