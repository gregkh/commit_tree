drm/i915: Create a gtt structure

The purpose of the gtt structure is to help isolate our gtt specific
properties from the rest of the code (in doing so it help us finish the
isolation from the AGP connection).

The following members are pulled out (and renamed):
gtt_start
gtt_total
gtt_mappable_end
gtt_mappable
gtt_base_addr
gsm

The gtt structure will serve as a nice place to put gen specific gtt
routines in upcoming patches. As far as what else I feel belongs in this
structure: it is meant to encapsulate the GTT's physical properties.
This is why I've not added fields which track various drm_mm properties,
or things like gtt_mtrr (which is itself a pretty transient field).
