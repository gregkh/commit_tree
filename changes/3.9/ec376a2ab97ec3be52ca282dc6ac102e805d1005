cpufreq / intel_pstate: Set timer timeout correctly

The current calculation of the delay time is wrong and a cut and
paste error from a previous experimental driver.  This can result in
the timeout being set to jiffies + 1 which setup the driver to race
with itself if the APIC timer interrupt happens at just the right
time.
