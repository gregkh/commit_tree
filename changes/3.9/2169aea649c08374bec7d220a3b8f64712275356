libceph: calculate placement based on the internal data types

Instead of using the old ceph_object_layout struct, update our internal
ceph_calc_object_layout method to use the ceph_pg type.  This allows us to
pass the full 32-bit precision of the pgid.seed to the callers.  It also
allows some callers to avoid reaching into the request structures for the
struct ceph_object_layout fields.
