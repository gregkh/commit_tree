swap: add per-partition lock for swapfile

swap_lock is heavily contended when I test swap to 3 fast SSD (even
slightly slower than swap to 2 such SSD).  The main contention comes
from swap_info_get().  This patch tries to fix the gap with adding a new
per-partition lock.

Global data like nr_swapfiles, total_swap_pages, least_priority and
swap_list are still protected by swap_lock.

nr_swap_pages is an atomic now, it can be changed without swap_lock.  In
theory, it's possible get_swap_page() finds no swap pages but actually
there are free swap pages.  But sounds not a big problem.

Accessing partition specific data (like scan_swap_map and so on) is only
protected by swap_info_struct.lock.

Changing swap_info_struct.flags need hold swap_lock and
swap_info_struct.lock, because scan_scan_map() will check it.  read the
flags is ok with either the locks hold.

If both swap_lock and swap_info_struct.lock must be hold, we always hold
the former first to avoid deadlock.

swap_entry_free() can change swap_list.  To delete that code, we add a
new highest_priority_index.  Whenever get_swap_page() is called, we
check it.  If it's valid, we use it.

It's a pity get_swap_page() still holds swap_lock().  But in practice,
swap_lock() isn't heavily contended in my test with this patch (or I can
say there are other much more heavier bottlenecks like TLB flush).  And
BTW, looks get_swap_page() doesn't really need the lock.  We never free
swap_info[] and we check SWAP_WRITEOK flag.  The only risk without the
lock is we could swapout to some low priority swap, but we can quickly
recover after several rounds of swap, so sounds not a big deal to me.
But I'd prefer to fix this if it's a real problem.

"swap: make each swap partition have one address_space" improved the
swapout speed from 1.7G/s to 2G/s.  This patch further improves the
speed to 2.3G/s, so around 15% improvement.  It's a multi-process test,
so TLB flush isn't the biggest bottleneck before the patches.
