x86: Move some contents of page_64_types.h into pgtable_64.h and page_64.h

This patch is meant to clean-up the fact that we have several functions in
page_64_types.h which really don't belong there.  I found this issue when I
had tried to replace __phys_addr with an inline function.  It resulted in the
realmode bits generating compile warnings about types.  In order to resolve
that I am relocating the address translation to page_64.h since this is in
keeping with where these functions are located in 32 bit.

In addtion I have relocated several functions defined in init_64.c to
pgtable_64.h as this seems to be where most of the functions related to
memory initialization were already located.

[ hpa: added missing #include <asm/pgtable.h> to apic_numachip.c,
  as reported by Yinghai Lu. ]
