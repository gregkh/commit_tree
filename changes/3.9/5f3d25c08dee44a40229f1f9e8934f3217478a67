ASoC: wm8985: Refactor set_pll code to avoid gcc warnings

Refactor set_pll code to avoid the following warnings:

sound/soc/codecs/wm8985.c:852:50: warning: 'pll_div.k' may be used uninitialized in this function
sound/soc/codecs/wm8985.c:849:9: warning: 'pll_div.n' may be used uninitialized in this function
sound/soc/codecs/wm8985.c:848:23: warning: 'pll_div.div2' may be used uninitialized in this function

Do the same as in commit 86ce6c9a (ASoC: WM8804: Refactor set_pll code to avoid
GCC warnings).
