ACPI: Change the ordering of acpi_bus_check_add()

If acpi_bus_check_add() is called for a handle already having an
existing struct acpi_device object attached, it is not necessary to
check the type and status of the device correspondig to it, so
change the ordering of acpi_bus_check_add() to avoid that.
