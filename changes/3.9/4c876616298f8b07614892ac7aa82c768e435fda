be2net: fix re-loaded PF driver to re-gain control of its VFs

Currently, when the PF driver is unloaded and re-loaded while VFs are attached
to VMs, it loses control of its VFs.

The PF driver now uses the newly defined/created GET_IFACE_LIST cmd
(available in FW ver >= 4.6) to query the if_id of the VFs
(enabled in its previous life). The PF driver then uses the if_id for
further VF configuration.

The GET_IFACE_MAC_LIST cmd has also implemented in BE3 FW for PF to
query pmac-ids used by its VFs.
