drm/i915: Allow objects to be created with no backing pages, but stolen space

In order to accommodate objects that are not backed by struct pages, but
instead point into a contiguous region of stolen space, we need to make
various changes to avoid dereferencing obj->pages or obj->base.filp.

First introduce a marker for the stolen object, that specifies its
offset into the stolen region and implies that it has no backing pages.
