net/irda: Use barrier to set task state

Without a memory and compiler barrier, the task state change
can migrate relative to the condition testing in a blocking loop.
However, the task state change must be visible across all cpus
prior to testing those conditions. Failing to do this can result
in the familiar 'lost wakeup' and this task will hang until killed.
