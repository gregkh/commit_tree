usb: gadget: file_storage: remove its last pieces

This patch removes the last pieces of the file_storage gadget hidden in
storage_common behind __maybe_unused bars.
The CBI bits have no user on the gadget side. Only file_storage
implemented the obsolete protocol.
The additional USB3.0 descriptors were served by file_storage, the other
gadgets are using composite for this.
