Revert "lockdep: check that no locks held at freeze time"

This reverts commit 6aa9707099c4b25700940eb3d016f16c4434360d.

Commit 6aa9707099c4 ("lockdep: check that no locks held at freeze time")
causes problems with NFS root filesystems.  The failures were noticed on
OMAP2 and 3 boards during kernel init:

  [ BUG: swapper/0/1 still has locks held! ]
  3.9.0-rc3-00344-ga937536 #1 Not tainted
  -------------------------------------
  1 lock held by swapper/0/1:
   #0:  (&type->s_umount_key#13/1){+.+.+.}, at: [<c011e84c>] sget+0x248/0x574

  stack backtrace:
    rpc_wait_bit_killable
    __wait_on_bit
    out_of_line_wait_on_bit

    rpc_run_task

Although the rootfs mounts, the system is unstable.  Here's a transcript
from a PM test:

Here's what the test log should look like:

Mailing list discussion is here:

Deal with this for v3.9 by reverting the problem commit, until folks can
figure out the right long-term course of action.
