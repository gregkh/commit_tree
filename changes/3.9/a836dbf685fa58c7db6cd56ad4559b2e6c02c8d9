ALSA: hda - Fix missing call of cmd flush in capture volume put callback

The capture volume put callback may call the node selection change,
and its actual call won't be triggered unless flushed.  In general,
we always need to call both snd_hda_codec_flush_amp_cache() and
snd_hda_codec_flush_cmd_cache() at the same place...
