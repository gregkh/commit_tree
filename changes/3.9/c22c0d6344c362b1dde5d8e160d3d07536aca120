mm: remove flags argument to mmap_region

After the MAP_POPULATE handling has been moved to mmap_region() call
sites, the only remaining use of the flags argument is to pass the
MAP_NORESERVE flag.  This can be just as easily handled by
do_mmap_pgoff(), so do that and remove the mmap_region() flags
parameter.
