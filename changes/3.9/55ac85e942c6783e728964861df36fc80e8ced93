regmap: irq: enable wake support by default

regmap-irq framework is used vastly by mfd drivers and some of
devices like TPS65910, TPS80036 do not support the wake base
register to enable wake.

Currently wake in regmap-irq only supported if client driver
passes the wake base register.

As the regmap-irq is mostly used by mfd devices and it is require
to have wake support from these devices in most of use cases,
enabling wake support by default in regmap-irq.
