sfc: Fix efx_rx_buf_offset() in the presence of swiotlb

We assume that the mapping between DMA and virtual addresses is done
on whole pages, so we can find the page offset of an RX buffer using
the lower bits of the DMA address.  However, swiotlb maps in units of
2K, breaking this assumption.

Add an explicit page_offset field to struct efx_rx_buffer.
