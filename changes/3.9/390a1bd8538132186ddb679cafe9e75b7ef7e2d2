NFC: Initial Secure Element API

Each NFC adapter can have several links to different secure elements and
that property needs to be exported by the drivers.
A secure element link can be enabled and disabled, and card emulation will
be handled by the currently active one. Otherwise card emulation will be
host implemented.
