scripts/kernel-doc: handle struct member __aligned without numbers

Commit ef5da59f1260 ("scripts/kernel-doc: handle struct member
__aligned") permits "char something [123] __aligned(8);".

However, by using \d we constraint ourselves with integers.  This is not
always the case.  In fact, it might be better to do char something[123]
__aligned(sizeof(u16));

For example, With wireless_dev defining:

    u8 address[ETH_ALEN] __aligned(sizeof(u16));

With \d, scripts/kernel-doc erroneously says:

    Warning(include/net/cfg80211.h:2618): Excess struct/union/enum/typedef member 'address' description in 'wireless_dev'

This is because the regex __aligned\s*\(\d+\) fails match at \d as
sizeof is used.

So replace \d with .  to indicate "something" in kernel-doc to ignore
__aligned(SOMETHING) in structs.  With this change, we can use integers
OR sizeof() or macros as we please.
