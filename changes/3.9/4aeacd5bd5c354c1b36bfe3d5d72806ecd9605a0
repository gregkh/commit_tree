sh-pfc: Use sh_pfc_ namespace prefix through the whole driver

Most of the function and structure names are prefixed by sh_pfc_. Fix
the ones that are not to avoid namespace clashes (especially for
functions that start with gpio_).

Not included in this patch are the platform data structures, those will
be reworked later.
