[media] rc: Call rc_register_device before irq setup

This should fix a potential race condition, when the irq handler
triggers while rc_register_device is still setting up the rdev->raw
device.
This crash has not been observed in practice, but there should be a very
small window where it could occur. Since ir_raw_event_store_with_filter
checks if rdev->raw is not NULL before using it, this bug is not
triggered if the request_irq triggers a pending irq directly (since
rdev->raw will still be NULL then).
This commit was tested on nuvoton-cir only.
