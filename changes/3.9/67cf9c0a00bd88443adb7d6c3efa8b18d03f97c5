ARM: at91: fix LCD-wiring mode

Fix regression introduced by commit 787f9fd23283 ("atmel_lcdfb: support
16bit BGR:565 mode, remove unsupported 15bit modes") which broke 16-bpp
modes for older SOCs which use IBGR:555 (msb is intensity) rather than
BGR:565.

The above commit removes the RGB:555-wiring hack by
removing the no longer used ATMEL_LCDC_WIRING_RGB555 define.
