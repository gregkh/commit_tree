e1000e: cosmetic move of #defines and function prototypes to the new nvm.h

Move #defines and function prototypes which are applicable to all/most
devices supported by the driver and are specific to the NVM component of
each device to the new nvm.h header file.  These #defines and function
prototypes can be used by other files in the driver and moving them to the
NVM-specific file makes it clearer to which component they are applicable.
