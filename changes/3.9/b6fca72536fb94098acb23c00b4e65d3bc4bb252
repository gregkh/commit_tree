sysctl: Enable IA64 "ignore-unaligned-usertrap" to be used cross-arch

IA64 defines /proc/sys/kernel/ignore-unaligned-usertrap to control
verbose warnings on unaligned access emulation.

Although the exact mechanics of what to do with sysctl (ignore/shout)
are arch specific, this change enables the sysctl to be usable cross-arch.
