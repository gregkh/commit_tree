cpufreq / intel_pstate: Change to disallow module build

Load order is important in order for intel_pstate to take over as the
default scaling driver from acpi-cpufreq.

If both are built-in, acpi-cpufreq uses late_initcall() and
intel_pstate uses device_initcall() so it will be able to register as
the scaling before acpi-cpufreq for the processors supported by
intel_pstate.

If acpi-cpufreq is built as a module then intel_pstate still gets
first option to become the scaling driver.
