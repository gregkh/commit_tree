Input: ALPS - add "Dolphin V1" touchpad support

These touchpads use a different protocol; they have been seen on Dell
N5110, Dell 17R SE, and others.

The official ALPS driver identifies them by looking for an exact match
on the E7 report: 73 03 50.  Dolphin V1 returns an EC report of
73 01 xx (02 and 0d have been seen); Dolphin V2 returns an EC report of
73 02 xx (02 has been seen).

Dolphin V2 probably needs a different initialization sequence and/or
report parser, so it is left for a future commit.
