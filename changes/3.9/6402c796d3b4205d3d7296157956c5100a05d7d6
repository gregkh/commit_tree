USB: EHCI: work around silicon bug in Intel's EHCI controllers

This patch (as1660) works around a hardware problem present in some
(if not all) Intel EHCI controllers.  After a QH has been unlinked
from the async schedule and the corresponding IAA interrupt has
occurred, the controller is not supposed access the QH and its qTDs.
There certainly shouldn't be any more DMA writes to those structures.
Nevertheless, Intel's controllers have been observed to perform a
final writeback to the QH's overlay region and to the most recent qTD.
For more information and a test program to determine whether this
problem is present in a particular controller, see

This patch works around the problem by always waiting for two IAA
cycles when unlinking an async QH.  The extra IAA delay gives the
controller time to perform its final writeback.

Surprisingly enough, the effects of this silicon bug have gone
undetected until quite recently.  More through luck than anything
else, it hasn't caused any apparent problems.  However, it does
interact badly with the path that follows this one, so it needs to be
addressed.

This is the first part of a fix for the regression reported at:
