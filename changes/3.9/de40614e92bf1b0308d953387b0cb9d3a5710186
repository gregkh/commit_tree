ARM: 7694/1: ARM, TCM: initialize TCM in paging_init(), instead of setup_arch()

tcm_init() call iotable_init() and it use early_alloc variants which
do memblock allocation. Directly using memblock allocation after
initializing bootmem should not permitted, because bootmem can't know
where are additinally reserved.
So move tcm_init() to a safe place before initalizing bootmem.
