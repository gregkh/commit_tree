net: cacheline adjust struct inet_frags for better frag performance

The globally shared rwlock, of struct inet_frags, shares
cacheline with the 'rnd' number, which is used by the hash
calculations.  Fix this, as this obviously is a bad idea, as
unnecessary cache-misses will occur when accessing the 'rnd'
number.

Also small note that, moving function ptr (*match) up in struct,
is to avoid it lands on the next cacheline (on 64-bit).
