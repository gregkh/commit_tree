[media] davinci: do not include mach/hardware.h

It is now possible to build the davinci vpss code
on multiplatform kernels, which causes a problem
since the driver tries to incude the davinci
platform specific mach/hardware.h file. Fortunately
that file is not required at all in the driver,
so we can simply remove the #include statement.

Without this patch, building allyesconfig results in:

drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:28:27: fatal error: mach/hardware.h: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
