efivars: explicitly calculate length of VariableName

It's not wise to assume VariableNameSize represents the length of
VariableName, as not all firmware updates VariableNameSize in the same
way (some don't update it at all if EFI_SUCCESS is returned). There
are even implementations out there that update VariableNameSize with
values that are both larger than the string returned in VariableName
and smaller than the buffer passed to GetNextVariableName(), which
resulted in the following bug report from Michael Schroeder,

  > /sys/firmware/efi/vars/KEKDefault-pport8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c
  > /sys/firmware/efi/vars/SecureBoot-pport8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c
  > /sys/firmware/efi/vars/SetupMode-Information8be4df61-93ca-11d2-aa0d-00e098032b8c

The issue here is that because we blindly use VariableNameSize without
verifying its value, we can potentially read garbage values from the
buffer containing VariableName if VariableNameSize is larger than the
length of VariableName.

Since VariableName is a string, we can calculate its size by searching
for the terminating NULL character.
