userns: Don't allow CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_FS

Don't allowing sharing the root directory with processes in a
different user namespace.  There doesn't seem to be any point, and to
allow it would require the overhead of putting a user namespace
reference in fs_struct (for permission checks) and incrementing that
reference count on practically every call to fork.

So just perform the inexpensive test of forbidding sharing fs_struct
acrosss processes in different user namespaces.  We already disallow
other forms of threading when unsharing a user namespace so this
should be no real burden in practice.

This updates setns, clone, and unshare to disallow multiple user
namespaces sharing an fs_struct.
