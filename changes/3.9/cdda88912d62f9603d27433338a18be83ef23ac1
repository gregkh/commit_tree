net: avoid to hang up on sending due to sysctl configuration overflow.

    I found if we write a larger than 4GB value to some sysctl
variables, the sending syscall will hang up forever, because these
variables are 32 bits, such large values make them overflow to 0 or
negative.

    This patch try to fix overflow or prevent from zero value setup
of below sysctl variables:

net.core.wmem_default
net.core.rmem_default

net.core.rmem_max
net.core.wmem_max

net.ipv4.udp_rmem_min
net.ipv4.udp_wmem_min

net.ipv4.tcp_wmem
net.ipv4.tcp_rmem
