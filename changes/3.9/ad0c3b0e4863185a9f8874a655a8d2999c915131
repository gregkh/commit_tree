ACPI / PM: More visible function for retrieving device power states

The function used for retrieving ACPI device power states,
__acpi_bus_get_power(), is now static, because it is only used
internally in drivers/acpi/bus.c.  However, it will be used
outside of that file going forward, so rename it to
acpi_device_get_power(), in analogy with acpi_device_set_power(),
add a kerneldoc comment to it and add its header to acpi_bus.h.
