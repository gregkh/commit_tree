x86: Use __pa_symbol instead of __pa on C visible symbols

When I made an attempt at separating __pa_symbol and __pa I found that there
were a number of cases where __pa was used on an obvious symbol.

I also caught one non-obvious case as _brk_start and _brk_end are based on the
address of __brk_base which is a C visible symbol.

In mark_rodata_ro I was able to reduce the overhead of kernel symbol to
virtual memory translation by using a combination of __va(__pa_symbol())
instead of page_address(virt_to_page()).
