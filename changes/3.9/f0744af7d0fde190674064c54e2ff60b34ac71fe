uprobes: Kill the pointless inode/uc checks in register/unregister

register/unregister verifies that inode/uc != NULL. For what?
This really looks like "hide the potential problem", the caller
should pass the valid data.

register() also checks uc->next == NULL, probably to prevent the
double-register but the caller can do other stupid/wrong things.
If we do this check, then we should document that uc->next should
be cleared before register() and add BUG_ON().

Also add the small comment about the i_size_read() check.
