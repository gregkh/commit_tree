drm: refcounting for sprite framebuffers

Now plane->fb holds a reference onto it's framebuffer. Nothing too
fancy going on here:
- Extract __drm_framebuffer_unreference to be called when we know
  we're not dropping the last reference, e.g. useful in the fb cleanup
  code.
- Reduce the locked sections in the set_plane ioctl to only protect
  plane->fb/plane->crtc and the driver callback (i.e. hw state).
  Everything either doesn't disappear (crtc, plane) or is refcounted
  (fb), and all the data we check is invariant over the respective
  object's lifetimes.
