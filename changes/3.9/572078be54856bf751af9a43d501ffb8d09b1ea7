mac80211: fix harmless station flush warning

If an interface is set down while authenticating or
associating, there's a station entry that will be
removed by the flushing in do_stop() and that will
cause a warning. It's otherwise harmless, but avoid
the warning by calling ieee80211_mgd_stop() first.
