tty: Only wakeup the line discipline idle queue when queue is active

Before waking up the tty line discipline idle queue first check if the queue is
active (non empty). This prevents unnecessary entering the critical section in
the wake_up() function and therefore avoid needless scheduling overhead on a
PREEMPT_RT system caused by two processes being in the same critical section.
