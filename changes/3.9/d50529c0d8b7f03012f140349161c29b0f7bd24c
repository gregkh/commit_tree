wlcore: pass wmm configuration to the fw

New fields were added to start_role(ap) and
set_peer_state commands, so the fw will be
able to know whether the sta/ap supports
wmm (the fw uses it in order to choose the
AC for some of its internally-generated frames)

For sta, take this value right from bss_conf->qos.

For ap, check for wmm support by looking for the
WMM IE in the configured beacon.
