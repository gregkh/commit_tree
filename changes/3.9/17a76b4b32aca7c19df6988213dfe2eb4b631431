i2c-designware: always set the STOP bit after last byte

If IC_EMPTYFIFO_HOLD_MASTER_EN is set to one, the DesignWare I2C controller
doesn't generate STOP on the bus when the FIFO is empty. This violates the
rules of Linux I2C stack as it requires that the STOP is issued once the
i2c_transfer() is finished.

However, there is no way to detect this from the hardware registers, so we
must make sure that the STOP bit is always set once the last byte of the
last message is transferred.

This patch is based on the work of Dirk Brandewie.
