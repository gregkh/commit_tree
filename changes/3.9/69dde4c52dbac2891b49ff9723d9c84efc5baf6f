ARM: 7654/1: Preserve L_PTE_VALID in pte_modify()

Following commit 26ffd0d4 (ARM: mm: introduce present, faulting entries
for PAGE_NONE), if a page has been mapped as PROT_NONE, the L_PTE_VALID
bit is cleared by the set_pte_ext() code. With LPAE the software and
hardware pte share the same location and subsequent modifications of pte
range (change_protection()) will leave the L_PTE_VALID bit cleared.

This patch adds the L_PTE_VALID bit to the newprot mask in pte_modify().
