cfq-iosched: enable full blkcg hierarchy support

With the previous two patches, all cfqg scheduling decisions are based
on vfraction and ready for hierarchy support.  The only thing which
keeps the behavior flat is cfqg_flat_parent() which makes vfraction
calculation consider all non-root cfqgs children of the root cfqg.

Replace it with cfqg_parent() which returns the real parent.  This
enables full blkcg hierarchy support for cfq-iosched.  For example,
consider the following hierarchy.

        root
      /      \
   A:500      B:250
  /     \
 AA:500  AB:1000

For simplicity, let's say all the leaf nodes have active tasks and are
on service tree.  For each leaf node, vfraction would be

 AA: (500  / 1500) * (500 / 750) =~ 0.2222
 AB: (1000 / 1500) * (500 / 750) =~ 0.4444
  B:                 (250 / 750) =~ 0.3333

and vdisktime will be distributed accordingly.  For more detail,
please refer to Documentation/block/cfq-iosched.txt.

v2: cfq-iosched.txt updated to describe group scheduling as suggested
    by Vivek.

v3: blkio-controller.txt updated.
