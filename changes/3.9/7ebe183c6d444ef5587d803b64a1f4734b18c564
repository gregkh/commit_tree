tcp: undo spurious timeout after SACK reneging

On SACK reneging the sender immediately retransmits and forces a
timeout but disables Eifel (undo). If the (buggy) receiver does not
drop any packet this can trigger a false slow-start retransmit storm
driven by the ACKs of the original packets. This can be detected with
undo and TCP timestamps.
