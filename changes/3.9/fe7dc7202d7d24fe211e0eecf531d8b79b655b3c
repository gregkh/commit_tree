ARM: arch_timer: include linux/errno.h

Patch 8a4da6e "arm: arch_timer: move core to drivers/clocksource"
moved a lot of code out of arch_timer.c, but ended up deleting
too much, which broke some configurations.

Obviously, include linux/errno.h is required to return error
values.

Without this patch, building allmodconfig results in:

arch/arm/kernel/arch_timer.c: In function 'arch_timer_sched_clock_init':
arch/arm/kernel/arch_timer.c:55:11: error: 'ENXIO' undeclared (first use in this function)
arch/arm/kernel/arch_timer.c:55:11: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
