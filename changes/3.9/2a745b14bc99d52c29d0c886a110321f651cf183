Btrfs: fix crash in log replay with qgroups enabled

When replaying a log tree with qgroups enabled, tree_mod_log_rewind does a
sanity-check of the number of items against the maximum possible number.
It calculates that number with the nodesize of fs_root. Unfortunately
fs_root is not yet set at this stage. So instead use the nodesize from
tree_root, which is already initialized.
