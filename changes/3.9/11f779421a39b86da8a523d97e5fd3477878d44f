nfsd: containerize NFSd filesystem

This patch makes NFSD file system superblock to be created per net.
This makes possible to get proper network namespace from superblock instead of
using hard-coded "init_net".

Note: NFSd fs super-block holds network namespace. This garantees, that
network namespace won't disappear from underneath of it.
This, obviously, means, that in case of kill of a container's "init" (which is not a mount
namespace, but network namespace creator) netowrk namespace won't be
destroyed.
