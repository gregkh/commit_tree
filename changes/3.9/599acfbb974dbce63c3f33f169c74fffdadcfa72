staging:iio:adis16400: Add helper macros for channel declaration

Most of the channels declared in the adis16400 driver look quite similar. This
patch adds a bunch of helper macros to initialize the channel spec for this
driver. This allows us to drastically reduce the number of lines of code needed
for the channel spec declaration.
