ACPI / scan: Prevent device add uevents from racing with user space

ACPI core adds sysfs device files after the given devices have been
registered with device_register(), which is not appropriate, because
it may lead to race conditions with user space tools using those
files.

Fix the problem by delaying the KOBJ_ADD uevent for ACPI devices
until after all of the devices' sysfs files have been created.

This also fixes a use-after-free in acpi_device_unregister().
