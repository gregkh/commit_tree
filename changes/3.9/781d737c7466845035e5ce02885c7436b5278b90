ACPI: Drop power resources driver

The ACPI power resources driver is not very useful, because the only
thing it really does is to restore the state of the power resources
that were "on" before system suspend or hibernation, but that may be
achieved in a different way.

Drop the ACPI power resources driver entirely and add
acpi_resume_power_resources() that will walk the list of all
registered power resources during system resume and turn on the ones
that were "on" before the preceding system suspend or hibernation.
