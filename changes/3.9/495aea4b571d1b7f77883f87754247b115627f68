dw_dmac: make usage of dw_dma_slave optional

The driver requires a custom slave configuration to be present to be able to
make the slave transfers. Nevertheless, in some cases we need only the request
line as an additional information to the generic slave configuration.  The
request line is provided by slave_id parameter of the dma_slave_config
structure. That's why the custom slave configuration could be optional for such
cases.
