usb: cp210x new Vendor/Device IDs

This patch adds support for the Lake Shore Cryotronics devices to
the CP210x driver.

These lines are ported from cp210x driver distributed by Lake Shore web site:
   http://www.lakeshore.com/Documents/Lake%20Shore%20cp210x-3.0.0.tar.gz
and licensed under the terms of GPLv2.

Moreover, I've tested this changes with Lake Shore 335 in my labs.
