    [IPV4]: Unify access to the routing tables.

the defenition of FIB_HASH_TABLE size has obtained wrong dependency:
it should depend upon CONFIG_IP_MULTIPLE_TABLES (as was in the original
code) but it was depended from CONFIG_IP_ROUTE_MULTIPATH

This patch returns the situation to the original state.

The problem was spotted by Tingwei Liu.
