aerdrv: Trace Event for PCI Express Advanced Error Reporting

This header file will define a new trace event that will be triggered when
a AER event occurs.  The following data will be provided to the trace
event.

char * dev_name - The name of the slot where the device resides
                  ([domain:]bus:device.function).

u32 status - Either the correctable or uncorrectable register
             indicating what error or errors have been see.

u8 severity - error severity 0:NONFATAL 1:FATAL 2:CORRECTED

The trace event will also provide a trace string that may look like:

"0000:05:00.0 PCIe Bus Error:severity=Uncorrected (Non-Fatal), Poisoned
TLP"
