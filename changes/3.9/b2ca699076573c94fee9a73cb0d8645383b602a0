USB: serial: fix null-pointer dereferences on disconnect

Make sure serial-driver dtr_rts is called with disc_mutex held after
checking the disconnected flag.

Due to a bug in the tty layer, dtr_rts may get called after a device has
been disconnected and the tty-device unregistered. Some drivers have had
individual checks for disconnect to make sure the disconnected interface
was not accessed, but this should really be handled in usb-serial core
(at least until the long-standing tty-bug has been fixed).

Note that the problem has been made more acute with commit 0998d0631001
("device-core: Ensure drvdata = NULL when no driver is bound") as the
port data is now also NULL when dtr_rts is called resulting in further
oopses.
