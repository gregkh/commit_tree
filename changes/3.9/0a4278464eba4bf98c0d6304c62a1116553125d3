ALSA: hda - Use standard fixup table for STAC922x

Rather straightforward conversion, except for ones for Intel Mac.
As Intel Mac have only unique codec SSIDs, we need to remap the fixup
again for the codec SSID and call the new fixup there.

Also, we can reduce model enums like STAC_MACMINI, which are model
aliases for backward compatibility, since they can be pointed directly
via hda_model_fixup table.
