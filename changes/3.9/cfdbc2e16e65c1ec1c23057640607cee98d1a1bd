ARC: Build system: Makefiles, Kconfig, Linker script

Arnd in his review pointed out that arch Kconfig organisation has several
deficiencies:

* Build time entries for things which can be runtime extracted from DT
  (e.g. SDRAM size, core clk frequency..)
* Not multi-platform-image-build friendly (choice .. endchoice constructs)
* cpu variants support (750/770) is exclusive.

The first 2 have been fixed in subsequent patches.
Due to the nature of the 750 and 770, it is not possible to build for
both together, w/o special runtime glue code which would hurt
performance.
