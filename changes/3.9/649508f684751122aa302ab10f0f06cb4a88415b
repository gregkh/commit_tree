trace/ring_buffer: handle 64bit aligned structs

Some 32 bit architectures require 64 bit values to be aligned (for
example Meta which has 64 bit read/write instructions). These require 8
byte alignment of event data too, so use
!CONFIG_HAVE_64BIT_ALIGNED_ACCESS instead of !CONFIG_64BIT ||
CONFIG_HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS to decide alignment, and align
buffer_data_page::data accordingly.
