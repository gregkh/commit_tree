staging: comedi: check s->async for poll(), read() and write()

Some low-level comedi drivers (incorrectly) point `dev->read_subdev` or
`dev->write_subdev` to a subdevice that does not support asynchronous
commands.  Comedi's poll(), read() and write() file operation handlers
assume these subdevices do support asynchronous commands.  In
particular, they assume `s->async` is valid (where `s` points to the
read or write subdevice), which it won't be if it has been set
incorrectly.  This can lead to a NULL pointer dereference.

Check `s->async` is non-NULL in `comedi_poll()`, `comedi_read()` and
`comedi_write()` to avoid the bug.
