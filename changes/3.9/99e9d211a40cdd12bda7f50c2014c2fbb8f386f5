bnx2x: Support of PF driver of a VF close request

The 'close' command is the opposite of an init request. Here the
queues of the VF are closed (if any are opened) and released.
This flow applies the 'q_teardown' flow on all the queues.
The VF state is changed by this request.
Interrupts are disabled for the VF when closed.
