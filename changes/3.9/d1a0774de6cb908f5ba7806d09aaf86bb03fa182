nfsd: clean up and clarify the cache expiration code

Add a preprocessor constant for the expiry time of cache entries, and
move the test for an expired entry into a function. Note that the current
code does not test for RC_INPROG. It just assumes that it won't take more
than 2 minutes to fill out an in-progress entry.

I'm not sure how valid that assumption is though, so let's just ensure
that we never consider an RC_INPROG entry to be expired.
