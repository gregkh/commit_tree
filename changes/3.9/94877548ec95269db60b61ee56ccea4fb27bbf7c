MAINTAINERS: Remove Mark M. Hoffman

Mark M. Hoffman stopped working on the Linux kernel several years
ago, so he should no longer be listed as a driver maintainer. I'm not
even sure if his e-mail address still works.

I can take over 3 drivers he was responsible for, the 4th one will
fall down to the subsystem maintainer.

Also give Mark credit for all the good work he did.
