ALSA: hda - Simplify the multi-io assignment with multi speakers

When speakers are chosen as the the primary output during evaluation,
we did some tricks to assign the possible multi-io jacks with a
certain offset value to multi_out dacs.  This was a workaround for the
case with multiple speakers like Acer Aspire.  But this is quite ugly
at the same time and the resultant code is hard to understand.  More
badly, it works wrongly for 2.1 speakers like Apple iMac91.

In this patch, instead of fiddling with the offset to multi_out dacs,
simply add a certain badness number if headphone(s) + multi-ios are
possible.  This simplify the code a bit, and it's more robust.
