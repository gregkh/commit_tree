mmc: sdhci: query card presence from cd-gpio before asking SDHCI

Call mmc_gpio_get_cd() to query card presence from cd-gpio before
asking SDHCI.  The rationale behind this change is that flag
SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION is designed for SDHCI controller to
tell that SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE is broken, and it should be used for this
case only.  So when cd-gpio is being used, the controller should set
the flag to tell that SDHCI_PRESENT_STATE is not available.

However, the existing code will skip checking cd-gpio as long as flag
SDHCI_QUIRK_BROKEN_CARD_DETECTION is set.  Change the querying order
between cd-gpio and SDHCI to support the rationale above.
