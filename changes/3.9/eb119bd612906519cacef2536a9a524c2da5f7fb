drm/i915: Access to snooped system memory through the GTT is incoherent

We ignore all the user requests to handle flushing to the GTT domain if
the user requests such on a snoopable bo, and as such access through the
GTT to such pages remains incoherent. The specs even warn that such
behaviour is undefined - a strong reason never to do so.
