nfsd: Fix memleak in svc_export_put

In func svc_export_parse, the uuid which used kmemdup to alloc will be
changed in func export_update.So the later kfree don't free this memory.
And it can't be free in func svc_export_parse because other place still
used.So put this operation in func svc_export_put.
