workqueue: remove global_cwq

global_cwq is now nothing but a container for per-cpu standard
worker_pools.  Declare the worker pools directly as
cpu/unbound_std_worker_pools[] and remove global_cwq.

* ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp moved from global_cwq to worker_pool.
  This probably would have made sense even before this change as we
  want each pool to be aligned.

* get_gcwq() is replaced with std_worker_pools() which returns the
  pointer to the standard pool array for a given CPU.

* __alloc_workqueue_key() updated to use get_std_worker_pool() instead
  of open-coding pool determination.

This is part of an effort to remove global_cwq and make worker_pool
the top level abstraction, which in turn will help implementing worker
pools with user-specified attributes.

v2: Joonsoo pointed out that it'd better to align struct worker_pool
    rather than the array so that every pool is aligned.
