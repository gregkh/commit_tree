mtd: davinci_nand: fix modular build with CONFIG_OF=y

Commit cdeadd712f52b16a9285386d61ee26fd14eb4085 (mtd: nand: davinci: add OF
support for davinci nand controller) has never been really build tested with
the driver as a module.  When the driver is built-in, the missing semicolon
after structure initializer is "compensated" by MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() macro
being empty and so the initializer using the trailing semicolon on the next
line; when the driver is built as a module, compilation error ensues, and as
the 'davinci_all_defconfig' has the NAND driver modular, this error prevents
DaVinci family kernel from building...
