of: Create function for counting number of phandles in a property

This patch creates of_count_phandle_with_args(), a new function for
counting the number of phandle+argument tuples in a given property. This
is better than the existing method of parsing each phandle individually
until parsing fails which is a horribly slow way to do the count.

Tested on ARM using the selftest code.

v3: - Rebased on top of selftest code cleanup patch
v2: - fix bug where of_parse_phandle_with_args() could behave like _count_.
    - made of_gpio_named_count() into a static inline regardless of CONFIG_OF_GPIO
