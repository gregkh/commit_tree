ARM: Fix broken commit 0cc41e4a21d43 corrupting kernel messages

Commit 0cc41e4a21d43 (arch: remove direct definitions of KERN_<LEVEL>
uses) is broken - not enough thought was put into changing:

	.asciz	"string"

to

	.asciz	"string1" "string2"

The problem is that each string gets _separately_ NUL terminated, so
the result is a string containing:

	"string1\0string2\0"

rather than:

	"string1string2\0"

With our new printk levels, this ends up as - eg, KERN_DEBUG "string":

	0x01 0x00 0x07 0x00 "string" 0x00

which produces lots of \x01 in the kernel log.
