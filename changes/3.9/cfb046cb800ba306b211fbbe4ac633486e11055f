[media] cx18/ivtv: fix regression: remove __init from a non-init function

Commits 5e6e81b2890db3969527772a8350825a85c22d5c (cx18) and
2aebbf6737212265b917ed27c875c59d3037110a (ivtv) added an __init
annotation to the cx18-alsa-load and ivtv-alsa-load functions. However,
these functions are called *after* initialization by the main cx18/ivtv
driver. By that time the memory containing those functions is already
freed and your machine goes BOOM.
