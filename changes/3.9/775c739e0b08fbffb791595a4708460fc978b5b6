PCI: pciehp: Drop suspend/resume ENTRY messages

In each suspend and resume cycle my laptop prints these messages at
KERN_INFO level:
    pciehp 0000:00:1c.1:pcie04: pciehp_suspend ENTRY
    pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie04: pciehp_suspend ENTRY

and
    pciehp 0000:00:1c.0:pcie04: pciehp_resume ENTRY
    pciehp 0000:00:1c.1:pcie04: pciehp_resume ENTRY

Drop these messages, that were probably used to debug the suspend and
resume code, but now serve no purpose.
