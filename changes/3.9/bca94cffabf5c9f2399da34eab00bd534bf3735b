drivers/net: delete 8390 based EISA drivers.

The NS8390 chip was essentially the 1st widespread PC ethernet
chip, starting its life on 8 bit ISA cards in the late 1980s.
Even with better technologies available (bus mastering etc)
the 8390 managed to get used on a few rare EISA cards in the
early to mid 1990s.

The EISA bus in the x86 world was largely confined to systems
ranging from 486 to 586 (essentially 200MHz or lower, and less
than 100MB RAM) -- i.e. machines unlikely to be still in service,
and even less likely to be running a 3.9+ kernel.

On top of that, only one of the five really ever was considered
non-experimental; the smc-ultra32 was the one -- since it was
largely just an EISA version of the popular smc-ultra ISA card.
All the others had such a tiny user base that they simply never
could be considered anything more than experimental.
