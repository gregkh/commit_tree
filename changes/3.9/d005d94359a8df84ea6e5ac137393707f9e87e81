mmc: sdhci-pltfm: Add a common clk API implementation of get_timeout_clock

Quite a few drivers have a implementation of the get_timeout_clock
callback which simply returns the result of clk_get_rate on the device's
clock. This patch adds a common implementation of this to the sdhci-pltfm
module and replaces all custom implementations with the common one.
