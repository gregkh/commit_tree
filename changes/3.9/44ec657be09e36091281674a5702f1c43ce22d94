[SCSI] remove can_power_off flag from scsi_device

Commit 166a2967b45ede2e2e56f3ede3cd32053dc17812 "libata: tell scsi layer
device supports runtime power off" introduced the can_power_off flag for
scsi_device and is used to support ZPODD implementation in SCSI layer.
Since ZPODD is now implemented in ATA layer, that flag is no longer
needed, so remove it.
