mmc: support packed write command for eMMC4.5 devices

This patch supports packed write command of eMMC4.5 devices.  Several
writes can be grouped in packed command and all data of the individual
commands can be sent in a single transfer on the bus. Large amounts of
data in one transfer rather than several data of small size are
effective for eMMC write internally.  As a result, packed command help
write throughput be improved.  The following tables show the results
of packed write.

Type A:
test     none |  packed
iozone   25.8 |  31
tiotest  27.6 |  31.2
lmdd     31.2 |  35.4

Type B:
test     none |  packed
iozone   44.1 |  51.1
tiotest  47.9 |  52.5
lmdd     51.6 |  59.2

Type C:
test     none |  packed
iozone   19.5 |  32
tiotest  19.9 |  34.5
lmdd     22.8 |  40.7
