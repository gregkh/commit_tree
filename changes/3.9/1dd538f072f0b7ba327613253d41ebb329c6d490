cpufreq: add imx6q-cpufreq driver

Add an imx6q-cpufreq driver for Freescale i.MX6Q SoC to handle the
hardware specific frequency and voltage scaling requirements.

The driver supports module build and is instantiated by the platform
device/driver mechanism, so that it will not be instantiated on other
platforms, as IMX is built with multiplatform support.
