usb: dwc3: gadget: fix isoc END TRANSFER Condition

There were still some corner cases where isoc transfer was not able to
restart, specially when missed isoc does not happen , and in fact gadget does
not queue any new request during giveback.

Cleanup function calls giveback first, which provides a way to queue
another request to gadget. But gadget did not had any data. So , it did
not call ep_queue. To twist it further, gadget did not queue till
cleanup for last queued TRB is called. If we ever reach this scenario,
we must call END TRANSFER, so that we receive a new  xfernotready with
information about current microframe number.

Also insure that there is no request submitted to core when issuing END
TRANSFER.
