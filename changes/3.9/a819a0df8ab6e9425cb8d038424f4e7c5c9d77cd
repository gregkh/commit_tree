staging:iio:accel:lis3l02dq remove sw_ring support.

The sw_ring buffer is being removed in favour of the kfifo version.
This is one of only a couple of driver still supporting its use.

This driver will hopefully also be removed in favour of supporting the
part in the unified ST accelerometer driver.
