Btrfs: fix double free in the btrfs_qgroup_account_ref()

The function btrfs_find_all_roots is responsible to allocate
memory for 'roots' and free it if errors happen,so the caller should not
free it again since the work has been done.

Besides,'tmp' is allocated after the function btrfs_find_all_roots,
so we can return directly if btrfs_find_all_roots() fails.
