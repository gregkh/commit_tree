vfio-pci: Add support for VGA region access

PCI defines display class VGA regions at I/O port address 0x3b0, 0x3c0
and MMIO address 0xa0000.  As these are non-overlapping, we can ignore
the I/O port vs MMIO difference and expose them both in a single
region.  We make use of the VGA arbiter around each access to
configure chipset access as necessary.
