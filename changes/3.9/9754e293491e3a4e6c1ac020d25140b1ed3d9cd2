net: Don't write to current task flags on every packet received.

Even for non-pfmalloc SKBs, __netif_receive_skb() will do a
tsk_restore_flags() on current unconditionally.

Make __netif_receive_skb() a shim around the existing code, renamed to
__netif_receive_skb_core().  Let __netif_receive_skb() wrap the
__netif_receive_skb_core() call with the task flag modifications, if
necessary.
