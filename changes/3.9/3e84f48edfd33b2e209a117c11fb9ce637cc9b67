vfs/splice: Fix missed checks in new __kernel_write() helper

Commit 06ae43f34bcc ("Don't bother with redoing rw_verify_area() from
default_file_splice_from()") lost the checks to test existence of the
write/aio_write methods.  My apologies ;-/

Eventually, we want that in fs/splice.c side of things (no point
repeating it for every buffer, after all), but for now this is the
obvious minimal fix.
