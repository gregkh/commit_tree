hugetlbfs: stop setting VM_DONTDUMP in initializing vma(VM_HUGETLB)

Currently we fail to include any data on hugepages into coredump,
because VM_DONTDUMP is set on hugetlbfs's vma.  This behavior was
recently introduced by commit 314e51b9851b ("mm: kill vma flag
VM_RESERVED and mm->reserved_vm counter").

This looks to me a serious regression, so let's fix it.
