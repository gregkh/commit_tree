block: optionally snapshot page contents to provide stable pages during write

This provides a band-aid to provide stable page writes on jbd without
needing to backport the fixed locking and page writeback bit handling
schemes of jbd2.  The band-aid works by using bounce buffers to snapshot
page contents instead of waiting.

For those wondering about the ext3 bandage -- fixing the jbd locking
(which was done as part of ext4dev years ago) is a lot of surgery, and
setting PG_writeback on data pages when we actually hold the page lock
dropped ext3 performance by nearly an order of magnitude.  If we're
going to migrate iscsi and raid to use stable page writes, the
complaints about high latency will likely return.  We might as well
centralize their page snapshotting thing to one place.
