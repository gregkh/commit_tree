rbd: prevent open for image being removed

An open request for a mapped rbd image can arrive while removal of
that mapping is underway.  We need to prevent such an open request
from succeeding.  (It appears that Maciej Galkiewicz ran into this
problem.)

Define and use a "removing" flag to indicate a mapping is getting
removed.  Set it in the remove path after verifying nothing holds
the device open.  And check it in the open path before allowing the
open to proceed.  Acquire the rbd device's lock around each of these
spots to avoid any races accessing the flags and open_count fields.
