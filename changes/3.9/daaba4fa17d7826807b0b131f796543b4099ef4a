net neighbour, decnet: Ensure to align device private data on preferred alignment.

To allow both of protocol-specific data and device-specific data
attached with neighbour entry, and to eliminate size calculation
cost when allocating entry, sizeof protocol-speicic data must be
multiple of NEIGH_PRIV_ALIGN.  On 64bit archs,
sizeof(struct dn_neigh) is multiple of NEIGH_PRIV_ALIGN, but on
32bit archs, it was not.

Introduce NEIGH_ENTRY_SPACE() macro to ensure that protocol-specific
entry-size meets our requirement.
