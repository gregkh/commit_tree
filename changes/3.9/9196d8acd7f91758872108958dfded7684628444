TTY: 8250, revert module name change

In 3.7 the 8250 module name was changed unintentionally from 8250 to
8250_core by commit 835d844d1a28efba81d5aca7385e24c29d3a6db2
(8250_pnp: do pnp probe before legacy probe). We then had to
re-introduce the old module options to ensure the old good
8250.nr_uart & co. still work. This can be done only by a very dirty
hack and we did it in f2b8dfd9e480c3db3bad0c25c590a5d11b31f4ef
(serial: 8250: Keep 8250.<xxxx> module options functional after driver
rename).

That is so damn ugly so that I decided to revert to the old module
name and deprecate the new 8250_core options present in 3.7 and 3.8
only. The deprecation will happen in the following patch.

Note that this patch changes the hack above to support "8250_core.*",
because we now have "8250.*" natively.
