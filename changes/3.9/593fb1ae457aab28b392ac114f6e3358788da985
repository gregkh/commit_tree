pps: Move timestamp read into PPS code proper

The PPS (Pulse-Per-Second) line discipline has developed a number of
unhealthy attachments to core tty data and functions, ultimately leading
to its breakage.

The previous patches fixed the crashing.  This one reduces coupling further
by eliminating the timestamp parameter from the dcd_change ldisc method.
This reduces header file linkage and makes the extension more generic,
and the timestamp read is delayed only slightly, from just before the
ldisc->ops->dcd_change method call to just after.

Fix attendant build breakage in
    drivers/tty/n_tty.c
    drivers/tty/tty_buffer.c
    drivers/staging/speakup/selection.c
    drivers/staging/dgrp/dgrp_*.c
