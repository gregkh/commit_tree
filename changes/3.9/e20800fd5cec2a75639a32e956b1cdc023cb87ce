alpha: irq: run all handlers with interrupts disabled

Linux has expected that interrupt handlers are executed with local
interrupts disabled for a while now, so ensure that this is the case on
Alpha even for non-device interrupts such as IPIs.

Without this patch, secondary boot results in the following backtrace:

  warning: at kernel/softirq.c:139 __local_bh_enable+0xb8/0xd0()
  trace:

A similar dump occurs if you try to reboot using magic-sysrq.
