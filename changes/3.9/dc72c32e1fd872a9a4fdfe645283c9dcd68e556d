printk: Provide a wake_up_klogd() off-case

wake_up_klogd() is useless when CONFIG_PRINTK=n because neither printk()
nor printk_sched() are in use and there are actually no waiter on
log_wait waitqueue.  It should be a stub in this case for users like
bust_spinlocks().

Otherwise this results in this warning when CONFIG_PRINTK=n and
CONFIG_IRQ_WORK=n:

	kernel/built-in.o In function `wake_up_klogd':
	(.text.wake_up_klogd+0xb4): undefined reference to `irq_work_queue'

To fix this, provide an off-case for wake_up_klogd() when
CONFIG_PRINTK=n.

There is much more from console_unlock() and other console related code
in printk.c that should be moved under CONFIG_PRINTK.  But for now,
focus on a minimal fix as we passed the merged window already.
