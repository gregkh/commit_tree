block: account iowait time when waiting for completion of IO request

Using wait_for_completion() for waiting for a IO request to be executed
results in wrong iowait time accounting. For example, a system having
the only task doing write() and fdatasync() on a block device can be
reported being idle instead of iowaiting as it should because
blkdev_issue_flush() calls wait_for_completion() which in turn calls
schedule() that does not increment the iowait proc counter and thus does
not turn on iowait time accounting.

The patch makes block layer use wait_for_completion_io() instead of
wait_for_completion() where appropriate to account iowait time
correctly.
