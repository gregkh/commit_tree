pwm: vt8500: Register write busy test performed incorrectly

Correct operation for register writes is to perform a busy-wait
after writing the register. Currently the busy wait it performed
before, meaning subsequent register writes to bitfields may occur
before the previous field has been updated.

Also, all registers are defined as 32-bit read/write. Change
pwm_busy_wait() to use readl rather than readb.

Improve readability of code with defines for registers and bitfields.
