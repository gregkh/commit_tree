Bluetooth: Fix link security setting when powering on

If a controller is powered on while the HCI_AUTO_OFF flag is set the
link security setting (HCI_LINK_SECURITY) might not be in sync with the
actual state of the controller (HCI_AUTH). This patch fixes the issue by
checking for inequality between the intended and actual settings and
sends a HCI_Write_Auth_Enable command if necessary.
