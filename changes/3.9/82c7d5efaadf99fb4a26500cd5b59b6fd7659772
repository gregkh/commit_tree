ACPI / scan: Treat power resources in a special way

ACPI power resources need to be treated in a special way by the
namespace scanning code, because they need to be ready to use as
soon as they have been discovered (even before registering ACPI
device nodes using them for power management).

For this reason, it doesn't make sense to separate the preparation
of struct acpi_device objects representing them in the device
hierarchy from the creation of struct acpi_power_resource objects
actually used for power resource manipulation.  Accordingly, it
doesn't make sense to define non-empty .add() and .remove() callbacks
in the power resources "driver" (in fact, it is questionable whether
or not it is useful to register such a "driver" at all).

Rearrange the code in scan.c and power.c so that power resources are
initialized entirely by one routine, acpi_add_power_resource(), that
also prepares their struct acpi_device objects and registers them
with the driver core, telling it to use a special release routine,
acpi_release_power_resource(), for removing objects that represent
power resources from memory.  Make the ACPI namespace scanning code
in scan.c always use acpi_add_power_resource() for preparing and
registering objects that represent power resources.
