[media] ngene: fix commit 36a495a336c3fbbb2f4eeed2a94ab6d5be19d186

The above commit were applied only partially; it broke tuner and
demod attach, but the part that added it to ngene_info was missing.

Not sure what happened there, but, without this patch, a regression
would be happening.

Also, gcc complains about a defined but not used symbol.

So, apply manually the missing part.
