memcg: move mem_cgroup_soft_limit_tree_init to mem_cgroup_init

Per-node-zone soft limit tree is currently initialized when the root
cgroup is created which is OK but it pointlessly pollutes memcg
allocation code with something that can be called when the memcg
subsystem is initialized by mem_cgroup_init along with other controller
specific parts.

While we are at it let's make mem_cgroup_soft_limit_tree_init void
because it doesn't make much sense to report memory failure because if
we fail to allocate memory that early during the boot then we are
screwed anyway (this saves some code).
