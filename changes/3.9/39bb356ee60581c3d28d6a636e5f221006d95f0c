ARM: OMAP2+: mux: correct wrong error messages

This is needed because the omap_mux_get_by_name()
function calls the _omap_mux_get_by_name subfunction
for each mux partition until needed mux is not found.
As a result, we get messages like
"Could not find signal XXX" for each partition
where this mux name does not exist.

This patch fixes wrong error message in
the _omap_mux_get_by_name() function moving it
to the omap_mux_get_by_name() one and as result
reduces noise in the kernel log.
