hw_random: make buffer usable in scatterlist.

virtio_rng feeds the randomness buffer handed by the core directly
into the scatterlist, since commit bb347d98079a547e80bd4722dee1de61e4dca0e8.

However, if CONFIG_HW_RANDOM=m, the static buffer isn't a linear address
(at least on most archs).  We could fix this in virtio_rng, but it's actually
far easier to just do it in the core as virtio_rng would have to allocate
a buffer every time (it doesn't know how much the core will want to read).
