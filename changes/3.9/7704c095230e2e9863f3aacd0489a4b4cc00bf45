ARM: remove struct sys_timer suspend and resume fields

These fields duplicate e.g. struct clock_event_device's suspend and
resume fields, so remove them now that nothing is using them. The aim
is to remove all fields from struct sys_timer except .init, then replace
the ARM machine descriptor's .timer field with a .init_time function
instead, and delete struct sys_timer.
