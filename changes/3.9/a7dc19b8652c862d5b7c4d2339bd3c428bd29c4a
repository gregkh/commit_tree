clockevents: Don't allow dummy broadcast timers

Currently tick_check_broadcast_device doesn't reject clock_event_devices
with CLOCK_EVT_FEAT_DUMMY, and may select them in preference to real
hardware if they have a higher rating value. In this situation, the
dummy timer is responsible for broadcasting to itself, and the core
clockevents code may attempt to call non-existent callbacks for
programming the dummy, eventually leading to a panic.

This patch makes tick_check_broadcast_device always reject dummy timers,
preventing this problem.
