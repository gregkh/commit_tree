bnx2x: Support VF FLR

The FLR indication arrives as an attention from the management processor.
Upon VF flr all FLRed function in the indication have already been
released by Firmware and now we basically need to free the resources
allocated to those VFs, and clean any remainders from the device
(FLR final cleanup).
