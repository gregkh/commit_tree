ARC: Add support for ioremap_prot API

Implement ioremap_prot() to allow mapping IO memory with variable
protection
via TLB.

Implementing this allows the /dev/mem driver to use its generic access()
VMA callback, which in turn allows ptrace to examine data in memory
mapped regions mapped via /dev/mem, such as Arc DCCM.

The end result is that it is possible to examine values of variables
placed into DCCM in user space programs via GDB.
