ARM: dove: drop "select COMMON_CLK_DOVE"

Commit 5b03df9ace680d7cdd34a69dfd85ca5f74159d18 ("ARM: dove: switch to
DT clock providers") added "select COMMON_CLK_DOVE" to Marvell Dove's
Kconfig entry. But there's no Kconfig symbol COMMON_CLK_DOVE, which
makes this select statement a nop. It's probably a leftover of some
experimental code that never hit mainline. Drop it.
