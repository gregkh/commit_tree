sched/rt: Further simplify pick_rt_task()

Function next_prio() has been removed and pull_rt_task() is the
only user of pick_next_highest_task_rt() at the moment.

pull_rt_task is not interested in p->nr_cpus_allowed, its only
interest is the fact that cpu is allowed to execute p. If
nr_cpus_allowed == 1, cpu != task_cpu(p) and cpu is allowed then
it means that task p is in the middle of the migration
techniques; the task waits until it is moved by migration
thread. So, lets pull it earlier.
