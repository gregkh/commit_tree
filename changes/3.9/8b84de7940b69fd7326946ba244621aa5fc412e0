rbd: assign watch request more directly

Both rbd_req_sync_op() and rbd_do_request() have a "linger"
parameter, which is the address of a pointer that should refer to
the osd request structure used to issue a request to an osd.

Only one case ever supplies a non-null "linger" argument: an
CEPH_OSD_OP_WATCH start.  And in that one case it is assigned
&rbd_dev->watch_request.

Within rbd_do_request() (where the assignment ultimately gets made)
we know the rbd_dev and therefore its watch_request field.  We
also know whether the op being sent is CEPH_OSD_OP_WATCH start.

Stop opaquely passing down the "linger" pointer, and instead just
assign the value directly inside rbd_do_request() when it's needed.

This makes it unnecessary for rbd_req_sync_watch() to make
arrangements to hold a value that's not available until a
bit later.  This more clearly separates setting up a watch
request from submitting it.
