spi/ath79: add delay between SCK changes

The driver uses the "as fast as it can" approach
to drive the SCK signal. However this does not
work with certain low speed SPI chips (e.g. the
PCF2123 RTC chip).

The patch adds per-bit slowdowns in order to be
able to use the driver with such chips as well.
