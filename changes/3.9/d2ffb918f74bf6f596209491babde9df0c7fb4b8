ARM: tegra: Fix build error w/ ARCH_TEGRA_114_SOC w/o ARCH_TEGRA_3x_SOC

This patch fixes the build error when ARCH_TEGRA_114_SOC is enabled
and ARCH_TEGRA_3x_SOC is disabled.

This provides Tegra114 with its own tegra114_init_early() instead of
making use of tegra30_init_early() so that T114 build doesn't depend
on T3x anymore.
