Btrfs: wait on ordered extents at the last possible moment

Since we don't actually copy the extent information from the source tree in
the fast case we don't need to wait for ordered io to be completed in order
to fsync, we just need to wait for the io to be completed.  So when we're
logging our file just attach all of the ordered extents to the log, and then
when the log syncs just wait for IO_DONE on the ordered extents and then
write the super.  Thanks,
