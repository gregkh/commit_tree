usb: gadget: ffs: fix enable multiple instances

This patch fixes an "off-by-one" bug found in
581791f (FunctionFS: enable multiple functions).

During gfs_bind/gfs_unbind the functionfs_bind/functionfs_unbind should be
called for every functionfs instance. With the "i" pre-decremented they
were not called for the zeroth instance.
