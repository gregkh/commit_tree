hwspinlock: fix __hwspin_lock_request error path

Even in failed case of pm_runtime_get_sync, the usage_count
is incremented. In order to keep the usage_count with correct
value and runtime power management to behave correctly, call
pm_runtime_put_noidle in such case.

In __hwspin_lock_request, module_put is also called before
return in pm_runtime_get_sync failed case.
