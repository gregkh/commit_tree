ACPICA: Cleanup indentation to reduce differences between Linux and ACPICA.

This is a cosmetic patch only. Comparison of the resulting binary showed
only line number differences.

This patch does not affect the generation of the Linux binary.
This patch decreases 210 lines of 20121018 divergence.diff.

The ACPICA source codes uses a totally different indentation style from the
Linux to be compatible with other users (operating systems or BIOS).

Indentation differences are critical to the release automation. There are
two causes related to the "indentation" that are affecting the release
automation:
1. The ACPICA -> Linux release process is:
     ACPICA source -- acpisrc - hierarchy - indent ->
     linuxized ACPICA source -- diff ->
     linuxized ACPICA patch (x) -- human intervention ->
     linuxized ACPICA patch (o)
     Where
       'x' means "cannot be directly applied to the Linux"
       'o' means "can be directly applied to the Linux"
   Different "indent" version or "indent" options used in the "indent"
   step will lead to different divergences.
   The version of "indent" used for the current release process is:
     GNU indent 2.2.11
   The options of "indent" used for the current release process is:
     -npro -kr -i8 -ts8 -sob -l80 -ss -ncs
2. Manual indentation prettifying work in the Linux side will also harm the
   automatically generated linuxized ACPICA patches, making them impossible
   to apply directly.

This patch fixes source code differences caused by the two causes so that
the "human intervention" can be reduced in the future.
