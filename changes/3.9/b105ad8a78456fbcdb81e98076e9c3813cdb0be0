staging: comedi: vmk80xx: remove private data 'probed'

The 'probed' variable is used in the usb driver (*probe) to detect an
unused element in the static private data arry. This variable is then
set after the usb driver has completed its (*probe) before calling
comedi_usb_auto_config(). When the comedi core does the auto config
it will call the (*auto_attach) function, vmk80xx_auto_attach(), which
then locates the correct private data in the static array by checking
to see if it has been 'probed' and that the 'intf' variable matches
the usb_interface pointer for the usb device.

Now that the private data is clean after failed usb probes and disconnects
we don't have to worry about have a garbage 'intf' value in the private
data that might match.

Remove the 'probed' flag from the private data and just use the 'intf'
pointer to detect the match.
