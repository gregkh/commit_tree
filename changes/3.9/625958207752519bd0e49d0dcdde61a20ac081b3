[media] cx2341x: move from media/i2c to media/common

The cx2341x module is a helper module for conexant-based MPEG encoders.
It isn't an i2c module at all, instead it should be in common since it is
used by 7 pci and usb drivers to handle the MPEG setup.
It also shouldn't be visible in the config menu as it is always
selected automatically by those drivers that need it.
