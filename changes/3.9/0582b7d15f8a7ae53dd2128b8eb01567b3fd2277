sh_eth: fix bitbang memory leak

sh_mdio_init() allocates pointer to 'struct bb_info' but only stores it locally,
so that sh_mdio_release() can't free it on driver unload.  Add the pointer to
'struct bb_info' to 'struct sh_eth_private', so that sh_mdio_init() can save
'bitbang' variable for sh_mdio_release() to be able to free it later...
