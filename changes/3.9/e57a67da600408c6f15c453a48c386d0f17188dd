HID: hid-sony: fix troubles with Sony remote clones

There are some Sony clone gamepads that are incompatible
with PS3 since firmware 3.50, as they decided to prevent those
devices to work, without any good technical reason. I was one of those
'blessed' people affected by their niceness with their customers.

Marcelo also has another device with a similar problem.

Perhaps due to Sony's way to block the device, damaging the device's
eeprom, or perhaps because they just have a different, broken Report
descriptor, there are 3 buttons that don't work on both devices
(the ones equivalent to square, round and X).

What it happens is that the descriptor generate weird EV_ABS events
to those buttons, instead of EV_MSC/EV_KEY.

A fix that seems to be enough for them is to return the original
sixaxis table instead of the broken one. That's what this patch
does.

Yet, there are some missing entries at the used keytable. On my
tests, all keys are now producing the right events, but the reported
keycodes look weird:

"square" key: (Button.0010 = 1)

1355524363.460835: event type EV_MSC(0x04): scancode = 0x90010
1355524363.460835: event type EV_KEY(0x01) key_up: BTN_DEAD(0x0001)

"round" key: (Button.000e = 1)

1355524410.908705: event type EV_MSC(0x04): scancode = 0x9000e
1355524410.908705: event type EV_KEY(0x01) key_down: (0x0001)
1355524410.971788: event type EV_MSC(0x04): scancode = 0x9000e
1355524410.971788: event type EV_KEY(0x01) key_up: (0x0001)

"X" key: (Button.000f = 1)
1355524384.880813: event type EV_MSC(0x04): scancode = 0x9000f
1355524384.880813: event type EV_KEY(0x01) key_down: (0x0001)
1355524384.979815: event type EV_MSC(0x04): scancode = 0x9000f
1355524384.979815: event type EV_KEY(0x01) key_up: (0x0001)

The rationale is likely due to those entries at rdesc table, where the
Kernel were not likely able to parse:

Button.000d ---> Key.?
Button.000e ---> Key.?
Button.000f ---> Key.?
Button.0010 ---> Key.BtnDead
Button.0011 ---> Key.?
Button.0012 ---> Key.?
Button.0013 ---> Key.?

As a reference, this is the rdisc used on my clone (a Mad Catz
model 8846):

05 01 09 04 a1 01 a1 02 85 01 75 08 95 01 15 00 26 ff 00 81 03 75 01 95 0d 15 00 25 01 35 00 45 01 05 09 19 01 29 0d 81 02 75 01 95 03 06 00 ff 81 03 05 01 25 07 46 3b 01 75 04 95 01 65 14 09 39 81 42 65 00 75 01 95 0c 06 00 ff 81 03 15 00 26 ff 00 05 01 09 01 a1 00 75 08 95 04 15 00 15 00 15 00 35 00 35 00 46 ff 00 09 30 09 31 09 32 09 35 81 02 c0 05 01 75 08 95 27 09 01 81 02 75 08 95 30 09 01 91 02 75 08 95 30 09 01 b1 02 c0 a1 02 85 02 75 08 95 30 09 01 b1 02 c0 a1 02 85 ee 75 08 95 30 09 01 b1 02 c0 a1 02 85 ef 75 08 95 30 09 01 b1 02 c0 c0

This is what's returned on Marcelo's device (not sure what is
the brand name of his device):

05 01 09 04 a1 01 a1 02 85 01 75 08 95 01 15 00 26 ff 00 81 03 75 01 95 13 15 00 25 01 35 00 45 01 05 09 19 01 29 13 81 02 75 01 95 0d 06 00 ff 81 03 15 00 26 ff 00 05 01 09 01 a1 00 75 08 95 04 35 00 46 ff 00 09 30 09 31 09 32 09 35 81 02 c0 05 01 95 13 09 01 81 02 95 0c 81 01 75 10 95 04 26 ff 03 46 ff 03 09 01 81 02 c0 a1 02 85 02 75 08 95 30 09 01 b1 02 c0 a1 02 85 ee 75 08 95 30 09 01 b1 02 c0 a1 02 85 ef 75 08 95 30 09 01 b1 02 c0 c0
