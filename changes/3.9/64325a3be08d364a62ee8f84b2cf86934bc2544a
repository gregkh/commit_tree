tty: Correct tty buffer flush.

  The root of problem is carelessly zeroing pointer(in function __tty_buffer_flush()),
when another thread can use it. It can be cause of "NULL pointer dereference".
  Main idea of the patch, this is never free last (struct tty_buffer) in the active buffer.
Only flush the data for ldisc(buf->head->read = buf->head->commit).
At that moment driver can collect(write) data in buffer without conflict.
It is repeat behavior of flush_to_ldisc(), only without feeding data to ldisc.

Also revert:
  commit c56a00a165712fd73081f40044b1e64407bb1875
  tty: hold lock across tty buffer finding and buffer filling
In order to delete the unneeded locks any more.
