igbvf: be sane about random MAC addresses

Tighten up some of the code surrounding MAC addresses. Since the PF is
now giving all zeros instead of a random address, check for this case
and generate a random address. This ensures that we always know when we
have a random address and udev won't get upset about it.

Additionally, tighten up some of the log messages and clean up the
formatting.
