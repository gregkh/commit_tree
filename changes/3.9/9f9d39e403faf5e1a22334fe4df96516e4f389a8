x86, io-apic: Remove !irq_remapped() check from __target_IO_APIC_irq()

This function is only called from default_ioapic_set_affinity()
which is only used when interrupt remapping is disabled
since the introduction of the set_affinity function pointer.
So the check will always evaluate as true and can be
removed.
