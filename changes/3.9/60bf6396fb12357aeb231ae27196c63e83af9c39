mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: name esdhc specific definitions with ESDHC_ prefix

Rename esdhc local definitions with ESDHC_ rather than SDHCI_ prefix,
so that we can distinguish them from SDHCI core definitions from name.

A couple of bit fields are also changed use shift for consistency and
better readability.
