ARM: 7649/1: mm: mm->context.id fix for big-endian

Since the new ASID code in b5466f8728527a05a493cc4abe9e6f034a1bbaab
("ARM: mm: remove IPI broadcasting on ASID rollover") was changed to
use 64bit operations it has broken the BE operation due to an issue
with the MM code accessing sub-fields of mm->context.id.

When running in BE mode we see the values in mm->context.id are stored
with the highest value first, so the LDR in the arch/arm/mm/proc-macros.S
reads the wrong part of this field. To resolve this, change the LDR in
the mmid macro to load from +4.
