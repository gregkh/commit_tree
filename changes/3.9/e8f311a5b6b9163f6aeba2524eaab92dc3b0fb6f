staging: comedi: vmk80xx: simplify vmk80xx_reset_device()

vmk80xx_reset_device() is called during initialization of a Velleman
K8055 (aka VM110) to send a reset command to the hardware.  The current
function is a bit long-winded and doesn't set the TRANS_OUT_BUSY flag to
prevent re-use of the transmit buffer while the URB is in progress.

Rewrite the function to use vmk80xx_write_packet() to send the command.
