cpufreq: instantiate cpufreq-cpu0 as a platform_driver

As multiplatform build is being adopted by more and more ARM platforms,
initcall function should be used very carefully.  For example, when
GENERIC_CPUFREQ_CPU0 is built in the kernel, cpu0_cpufreq_driver_init()
will be called on all the platforms to initialize cpufreq-cpu0 driver.

To eliminate this undesired the effect, the patch changes cpufreq-cpu0
driver to have it instantiated as a platform_driver.  Then it will only
run on platforms that create the platform_device "cpufreq-cpu0".

Along with the change, it also changes cpu_dev to be &pdev->dev,
so that managed functions can start working, and module build gets
supported too.

The highbank-cpufreq driver is also updated accordingly to adapt the
changes on cpufreq-cpu0.
