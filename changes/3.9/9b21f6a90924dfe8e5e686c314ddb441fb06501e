netfilter: ctnetlink: allow userspace to modify labels

Add the ability to set/clear labels assigned to a conntrack
via ctnetlink.

To allow userspace to only alter specific bits, Pablo suggested to add
a new CTA_LABELS_MASK attribute:

The new set of active labels is then determined via

active = (active & ~mask) ^ changeset

i.e., the mask selects those bits in the existing set that should be
changed.

This follows the same method already used by MARK and CONNMARK targets.

Omitting CTA_LABELS_MASK is the same as setting all bits in CTA_LABELS_MASK
to 1: The existing set is replaced by the one from userspace.
