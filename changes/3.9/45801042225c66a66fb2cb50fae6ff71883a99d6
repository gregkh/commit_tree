arm: arch_timer: add isbs to register accessors

Without the isbs in arch_timer_get_cnt{p,v}ct the cpu may speculate
reads and return stale values. This could be bad for code sensitive to
changes in expected deltas between calls (e.g. the delay loop).

Without isbs in arch_timer_reg_write the processor may reorder
instructions around enabling/disabling of the timer or writing the
compare value, which we probably don't want.

This patch adds isbs to prevent those issues.
