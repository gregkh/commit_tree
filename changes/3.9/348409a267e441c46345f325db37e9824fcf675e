usb: gadget: at91_udc: don't use [delayed_]work_pending()

There's no need to test whether a (delayed) work item in pending
before queueing, flushing or cancelling it.  Most uses are unnecessary
and quite a few of them are buggy.

Remove unnecessary pending tests from at91_udc.  Only compile tested.
