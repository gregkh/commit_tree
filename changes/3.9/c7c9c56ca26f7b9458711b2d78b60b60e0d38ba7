x86, apicv: add virtual interrupt delivery support

Virtual interrupt delivery avoids KVM to inject vAPIC interrupts
manually, which is fully taken care of by the hardware. This needs
some special awareness into existing interrupr injection path:

- for pending interrupt, instead of direct injection, we may need
  update architecture specific indicators before resuming to guest.

- A pending interrupt, which is masked by ISR, should be also
  considered in above update action, since hardware will decide
  when to inject it at right time. Current has_interrupt and
  get_interrupt only returns a valid vector from injection p.o.v.
