ACPI / PM: Take order attribute of power resources into account

ACPI power resources have an order attribute that should be taken
into account when turning them on and off, but it is not used now.

Modify the power resources management code to preserve the
spec-compliant ordering of power resources that power states of
devices depend on (analogous changes will be done separately for
power resources used for wakeup).
