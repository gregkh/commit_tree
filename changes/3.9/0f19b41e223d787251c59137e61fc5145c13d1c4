mac80211: remove ARP filter enable/disable logic

Depending on the driver, having ARP filtering for
some addresses may be possible. Remove the logic
that tracks whether ARP filter is enabled or not
and give the driver the total number of addresses
instead of the length of the list so it can make
its own decision.
