KVM: Make kvm_mmu_change_mmu_pages() take mmu_lock by itself

No reason to make callers take mmu_lock since we do not need to protect
kvm_mmu_change_mmu_pages() and kvm_mmu_slot_remove_write_access()
together by mmu_lock in kvm_arch_commit_memory_region(): the former
calls kvm_mmu_commit_zap_page() and flushes TLBs by itself.

Note: we do not need to protect kvm->arch.n_requested_mmu_pages by
mmu_lock as can be seen from the fact that it is read locklessly.
