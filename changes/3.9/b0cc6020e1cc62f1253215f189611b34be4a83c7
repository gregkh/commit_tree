PCI: Enable ARI if dev and upstream bridge support it; disable otherwise

Currently, we enable ARI in a device's upstream bridge if the bridge and
the device support it.  But we never disable ARI, even if the device is
removed and replaced with a device that doesn't support ARI.

This means that if we hot-remove an ARI device and replace it with a
non-ARI multi-function device, we find only function 0 of the new device
because the upstream bridge still has ARI enabled, and next_ari_fn()
only returns function 0 for the new non-ARI device.

This patch disables ARI in the upstream bridge if the device doesn't
support ARI.  See the PCIe spec, r3.0, sec 6.13.
