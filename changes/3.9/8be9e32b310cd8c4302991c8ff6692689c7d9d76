dmatest: adjust invalid module parameters for number of source buffers

DMA Engine test module has module parameters to set the number of source
buffers for xor and pq operations.  We can set these values larger than the
maximum number of sources that the device can support.  These values are
not adjusted and the unsupported number of source buffers are passed to the
device.  But most drivers don't check it, so unexpected results will happen.

This makes an appropriate adjustment for these module parameters before use.
