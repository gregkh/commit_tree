mwifiex: store card specific data in PCI device table entry

This patch adds support for storing PCIe device specific data
into driver_data structure of pci_device_id. When a device with
known device_id is probed, we use this driver_data to populate
card specific structres in driver.
This enables to remove device specific defines for scratch
registers, firmware name, FW download block size, etc. from
source code.

This will make addition of support for new chipsets a lot easier.
