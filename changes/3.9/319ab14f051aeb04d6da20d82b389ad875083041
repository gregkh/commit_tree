ktest: Do not require CONSOLE for build or install bisects

If the user is doing a build or install bisect, there's no reason to
have them define CONSOLE, as the console does not need to be read. The
console only needs to be read for boot tests.

CONSOLE is not required for normal build or install tests, let's not
require it for bisect tests with BISECT_TYPE of build or install.
