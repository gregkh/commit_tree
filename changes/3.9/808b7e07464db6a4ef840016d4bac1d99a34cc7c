ARM: OMAP2+: Add multiplatform debug_ll support

Add multiplatform debug_ll support by stripping away
the custom hacks to detect the port from debug-macro.S.

Note that this now requires the specific debug_ll port to
be selected in the .config.

The old debug-macro.S will be removed a bit later
once we are sure things work properly with multiplatform
enabled.
