e1000e: fix ethtool offline register test for I217

The SHRAH[9] register on I217 has a different R/W bit-mask than RAR and
SHRAL/H registers.  Set R/W bit-mask appropriately for SHRAH[9] when
testing the R/W ability of the register.  Also, fix the error message log
format so that it does not provide misleading information (i.e. the logged
register address could be incorrect).
