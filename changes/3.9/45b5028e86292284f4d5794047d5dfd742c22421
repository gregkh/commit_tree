mac80211: fix mesh sta teardown

The patch "mac80211: clean up mesh sta allocation warning"
moved some mesh initialization into a path which is only
called when the kernel handles peering. This causes a hang
when mac80211 tries to clean up a userspace-allocated
station entry and delete a timer which has never been
initialized.

To avoid this, only do any mesh sta peering teardown if
the kernel is actually handling it.

The same is true when quiescing before suspend.
