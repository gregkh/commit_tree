fuse: fix type definitions in uapi header

Commit 7e98d53086d18c877cb44e9065219335184024de (Synchronize fuse header with
one used in library) added #ifdef __linux__ around defines if it is not set.
The kernel build is self-contained and can be built on non-Linux toolchains.
After the mentioned commit builds on non-Linux toolchains will try to include
stdint.h and fail due to -nostdinc, and then fail with a bunch of undefined type
errors.

Fix by checking for __KERNEL__ instead of __linux__ and using the standard int
types instead of the linux specific ones.
