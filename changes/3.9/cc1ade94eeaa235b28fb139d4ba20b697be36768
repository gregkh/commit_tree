mlx4_core: Disable memory windows for virtual functions

Do not enable memory windows allocation for virtual functions.

In addition, add a few safety checks, such as:

* Verifying the PD of a new MPT matches the VF.
* Making sure binding memory window isn't enabled for FMRs, and
  that new memory windows are not FMR themselves.
