idr: implement lookup hint

While idr lookup isn't a particularly heavy operation, it still is too
substantial to use in hot paths without worrying about the performance
implications.  With recent changes, each idr_layer covers 256 slots
which should be enough to cover most use cases with single idr_layer
making lookup hint very attractive.

This patch adds idr->hint which points to the idr_layer which
allocated an ID most recently and the fast path lookup becomes

	if (look up target's prefix matches that of the hinted layer)
		return hint->ary[ID's offset in the leaf layer];

which can be inlined.

idr->hint is set to the leaf node on idr_fill_slot() and cleared from
free_layer().
