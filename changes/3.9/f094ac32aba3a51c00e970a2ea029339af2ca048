Btrfs: fix NULL pointer after aborting a transaction

While doing cleanup work on an aborted transaction, we've set
the global running transaction pointer to NULL _before_ waiting all
other transaction handles to finish, so others'd hit NULL pointer
crash when referencing the global running transaction pointer.

This first sets a hint to avoid new transaction handle joining, then
waits other existing handles to abort or finish so that we can safely
set the above global pointer to NULL.
