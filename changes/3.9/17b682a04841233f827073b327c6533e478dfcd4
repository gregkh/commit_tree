openvswitch: Fix parsing invalid LLC/SNAP ethertypes

Before this patch, if an LLC/SNAP packet with OUI 00:00:00 had an
ethertype less than 1536 the flow key given to userspace in the upcall
would contain the invalid ethertype (for example, 3). If userspace
attempted to insert a kernel flow for this key it would be rejected
by ovs_flow_from_nlattrs.

This patch allows OVS to pass the OFTest pktact.DirectBadLlcPackets.
