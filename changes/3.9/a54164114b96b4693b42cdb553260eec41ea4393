tracing: Add checks if tr->buffer is NULL in tracing_reset{_online_cpus}

max_tr->buffer could be NULL in the tracing_reset{_online_cpus}. In this
case, a NULL pointer dereference happens, so we should return immediately
from these functions.

Note, the current code does not call tracing_reset*() with max_tr when
its buffer is NULL, but future code will. This patch is needed to prevent
the future code from crashing.
