tracing: Make a snapshot feature available from userspace

Ftrace has a snapshot feature available from kernel space and
latency tracers (e.g. irqsoff) are using it. This patch enables
user applictions to take a snapshot via debugfs.

Add "snapshot" debugfs file in "tracing" directory.

  snapshot:
    This is used to take a snapshot and to read the output of the
    snapshot.

     # echo 1 > snapshot

    This will allocate the spare buffer for snapshot (if it is
    not allocated), and take a snapshot.

     # cat snapshot

    This will show contents of the snapshot.

     # echo 0 > snapshot

    This will free the snapshot if it is allocated.

    Any other positive values will clear the snapshot contents if
    the snapshot is allocated, or return EINVAL if it is not allocated.
