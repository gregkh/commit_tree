ipc: set msg back to -EAGAIN if copy wasn't performed

Make sure that msg pointer is set back to error value in case of
MSG_COPY flag is set and desired message to copy wasn't found.  This
garantees that msg is either a error pointer or a copy address.

Otherwise the last message in queue will be freed without unlinking from
the queue (which leads to memory corruption) and the dummy allocated
copy won't be released.
