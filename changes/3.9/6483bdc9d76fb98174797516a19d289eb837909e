net: qmi_wwan: fixup destination address (firmware bug workaround)

Received packets are sometimes addressed to 00:a0:c6:00:00:00
instead of the address the device firmware should have learned
from the host:

The bogus address is always the same, and matches the address
suggested by many devices as a default address.  It is likely a
hardcoded firmware default.

The circumstances where this bug has been observed indicates that
the trigger is related to timing or some other factor the host
cannot control. Repeating the exact same configuration sequence
that caused it to trigger once, will not necessarily cause it to
trigger the next time. Reproducing the bug is therefore difficult.
This opens up a possibility that the bug is more common than we can
confirm, because affected devices often will work properly again
after a reset.  A procedure most users are likely to try out before
reporting a bug.

Unconditionally rewriting the destination address if the first digit
of the received packet is 0, is considered an acceptable compromise
since we already have to inspect this digit.  The simplification will
cause unnecessary rewrites if the real address starts with 0, but this
is still better than adding additional tests for this particular case.
