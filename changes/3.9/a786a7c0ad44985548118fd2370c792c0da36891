wanrouter: completely decouple obsolete code from kernel.

The original suggestion to delete wanrouter started earlier
with the mainline commit f0d1b3c2bcc5de8a17af5f2274f7fcde8292b5fc
("net/wanrouter: Deprecate and schedule for removal") in May 2012.

More importantly, Dan Carpenter found[1] that the driver had a
fundamental breakage introduced back in 2008, with commit
7be6065b39c3 ("netdevice wanrouter: Convert directly reference of
netdev->priv").  So we know with certainty that the code hasn't been
used by anyone willing to at least take the effort to send an e-mail
report of breakage for at least 4 years.

This commit does a decouple of the wanrouter subsystem, by going
after the Makefile/Kconfig and similar files, so that these mainline
files that we are keeping do not have the big wanrouter file/driver
deletion commit tied into their history.

Once this commit is in place, we then can remove the obsolete cyclomx
drivers and similar that have a dependency on CONFIG_WAN_ROUTER_DRIVERS.
