workqueue: move global_cwq->lock to worker_pool

Move gcwq->lock to pool->lock.  The conversion is mostly
straight-forward.  Things worth noting are

* In many places, this removes the need to use gcwq completely.  pool
  is used directly instead.  get_std_worker_pool() is added to help
  some of these conversions.  This also leaves get_work_gcwq() without
  any user.  Removed.

* In hotplug and freezer paths, the pools belonging to a CPU are often
  processed together.  This patch makes those paths hold locks of all
  pools, with highpri lock nested inside, to keep the conversion
  straight-forward.  These nested lockings will be removed by
  following patches.

This is part of an effort to remove global_cwq and make worker_pool
the top level abstraction, which in turn will help implementing worker
pools with user-specified attributes.
