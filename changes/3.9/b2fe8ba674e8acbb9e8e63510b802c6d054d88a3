uprobes/perf: Avoid uprobe_apply() whenever possible

uprobe_perf_open/close call the costly uprobe_apply() every time,
we can avoid it if:

	- "nr_systemwide != 0" is not changed.

	- There is another process/thread with the same ->mm.

	- copy_proccess() does inherit_event(). dup_mmap() preserves the
	  inserted breakpoints.

	- event->attr.enable_on_exec == T, we can rely on uprobe_mmap()
	  called by exec/mmap paths.

	- tp_target is exiting. Only _close() checks PF_EXITING, I don't
	  think TRACE_REG_PERF_OPEN can hit the dying task too often.
