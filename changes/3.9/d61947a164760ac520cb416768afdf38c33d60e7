ARM: 7657/1: head: fix swapper and idmap population with LPAE and big-endian

The LPAE page table format uses 64-bit descriptors, so we need to take
endianness into account when populating the swapper and idmap tables
during early initialisation.

This patch ensures that we store the two words making up each page table
entry in the correct order when running big-endian.
