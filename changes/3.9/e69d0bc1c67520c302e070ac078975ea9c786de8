drm/i915: extract common link_m_n helpers

Both the dp and fdi code use the exact same computations (ignore minor
differences in conversion between bits and bytes).

This makes it even more apparent that we have a _massive_ mess between
cpu transcoder/fdi link/pch transcoder and pch link settings. And also
that we have hilarious amounts of confusion between edp and dp
(despite that they're identical at a link level).
