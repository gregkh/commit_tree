iwlwifi: use threaded interrupt handler

With new transports coming up, move to threaded
interrupt handling now. This has the advantage
that we can use the same locking scheme with all
different transports we may need to implement.

Note that the TX path obviously still runs in a
tasklet, so some spin_lock() calls need to change
to spin_lock_bh() calls to properly lock out the
TX path.

In my test on a Calpella platform this has no
impact on throughput or latency.

Also add lockdep annotations to avoid lockups due
to catch sending synchronous commands or using
locks that connect with them from the irq thread.
