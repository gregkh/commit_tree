dm cache: reduce bio front_pad size in writeback mode

A recent patch to fix the dm cache target's writethrough mode extended
the bio's front_pad to include a 1056-byte struct dm_bio_details.
Writeback mode doesn't need this, so this patch reduces the
per_bio_data_size to 16 bytes in this case instead of 1096.

The dm_bio_details structure was added in "dm cache: fix writes to
cache device in writethrough mode" which fixed commit e2e74d617e ("dm
cache: fix race in writethrough implementation").  In writeback mode
we avoid allocating the writethrough-specific members of the
per_bio_data structure (the dm_bio_details structure included).
