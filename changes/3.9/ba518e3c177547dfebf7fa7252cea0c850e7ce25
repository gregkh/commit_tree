PCI: pciehp: Iterate over all devices in slot, not functions 0-7

Currently, we enumerate devices in a slot with pci_scan_slot(), then
iterate through all the devices we found by looking for functions 0-7.  But
that's wrong for ARI devices, which may have function numbers up to 255.

This means that when we hot-add an ARI device, pciehp only initializes
functions 0-7, and other functions don't work correctly.  Additionally, if
we hot-remove the device, pciehp only removes functions 0-7, leaving stale
pci_dev structures for any other functions.

This patch fixes the problem by iterating over devices in a slot by using
the upstream bridge's "bus->devices" list instead.
