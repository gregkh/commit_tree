perf tools: Fix TUI helpline output

In commit e2f4351 "perf ui/helpline: Introduce ui_helpline__vshow()" the
test for the browser used made ui_helpline__vshow() to be called only
for the GTK browser.

The TUI one then was not used and vfprintf(stderr, ...) was used
instead, making the TUI scroll the screen instead of just printing on
the last line.

Fix it by doing the proper check, that is to call ui_helpline__vshow to
be called for both the TUI and GTK browsers.
