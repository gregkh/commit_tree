async: initialise list heads to fix crash

9fdb04cdc55 ("async: replace list of active domains with global list
of pending items") added a struct list_head global_list in struct
async_entry, which isn't initialised.  This means that if
!domain->registered at __async_schedule(), then list_del_init() will
be called on the list head in async_run_entry_fn with both pointers
NULL, causing a crash.  This is fixed by initialising both the
global_list and domain_list list_heads after kzalloc'ing the entry.

This was noticed due to dapm_power_widgets() which uses
ASYNC_DOMAIN_EXCLUSIVE, which initialises the domain->registered to 0.
