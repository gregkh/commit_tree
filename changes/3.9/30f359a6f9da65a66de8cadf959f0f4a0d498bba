target: Fix incorrect fallthrough of ALUA Standby/Offline/Transition CDBs

This patch fixes a bug where a handful of informational / control CDBs
that should be allowed during ALUA access state Standby/Offline/Transition
where incorrectly returning CHECK_CONDITION + ASCQ_04H_ALUA_TG_PT_*.

This includes INQUIRY + REPORT_LUNS, which would end up preventing LUN
registration when LUN scanning occured during these ALUA access states.
