staging: comedi: simplify comedi_set_hw_dev()

Since `get_device()` and `put_device()` can take a NULL device
parameter, `comedi_set_hw_dev()` can be simplified to always call
`get_device()` for the new, possibly NULL hardware device, and
`put_device()` for the old, possibly NULL hardware device.  As long as
we do it in that order, there shouldn't be any problem with
`kref_release()` getting called unexpectedly when the new hardware
device is the old hardware device.

Simplify `comedi_set_hw_dev()` and update the comment because the
function is used for additional purposes since the old comment was
written.
