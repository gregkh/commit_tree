backlight: lp855x_bl: support new LP8557 device

LP8557 is one of LP855x family device, but it has different register map
and initialization process.  To support this device, device specific
configuration is done through the lp855x_device_config structure.

Few register definitions are fixed for better readability.
  BRIGHTNESS_CTRL -> LP855X_BRIGHTNESS_CTRL
  DEVICE_CTRL     -> LP855X_DEVICE_CTRL
  EEPROM_START    -> LP855X_EEPROM_START
  EEPROM_END      -> LP855X_EEPROM_END
  EPROM_START     -> LP8556_EPROM_START
  EPROM_END       -> LP8556_EPROM_END

And LP8557 register definitions are added.  New register function,
lp855x_update_bit() is added.
