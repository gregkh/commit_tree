Fixed dead ifdef block by adding missing Kconfig option.

Added missing Kconfig option KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC which lead to a dead
ifdef block in kernel/debug/kdb/kdb_main.c:73-75.

The code using KDB_CONTINUE_CATASTROPHIC was originally introduced in
commit '5d5314d6795f3c1c0f415348ff8c51f7de042b77' by Jason Wessel.
This patchset ("kdb: core for kgdb back end (1 of 2)")
added platform independent part of kdb to the linux kernel.

The Kernel option however, even though it had the same options and
behaviour on all supported architectures, was part of the x86 and
ia64 patchset of KDB and therefore not pulled into the mainline kernel tree.

I actually took the originally written Kconfig by
Keith Owens <kaos@sgi.com> (2003-06-20 according to KDB changelog)
and changed it to reflect the correct behaviour,
as the KDUMP patchset is not part of the kernel and the expected
functionality is missing from it.
