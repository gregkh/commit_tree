tools/power turbostat: display SMI count by default

The SMI counter is popular -- so display it by default
rather than requiring an option.  What the heck,
we've blown the 80 column budget on many systems already...

Note that the value displayed is the delta
during the measurement interval.
The absolute value of the counter can still be seen with
the generic 32-bit MSR option, ie.  -m 0x34
