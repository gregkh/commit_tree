[media] drivers/media/platform/soc_camera/pxa_camera.c: use devm_ functions

This patch uses various devm_ functions for data that is allocated in the
probe function of a platform driver and is only freed in the remove
function.
This also fixes a checkpatch warning, removing a space before a \n in a
string.
