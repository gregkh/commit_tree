clk: sunxi: remove stale Makefile entry

Patch 85a18198 "clk: sunxi: Use common of_clk_init() function"
removed the clk-sunxi.c file but left the Makefile entry, which
causes a build error in multi_v7_defconfig:

make[4]: *** No rule to make target `drivers/clk/clk-sunxi.o', needed by `drivers/clk/built-in.o'.

The obvious fix is to remove the extraneous line from the
Makefile.
