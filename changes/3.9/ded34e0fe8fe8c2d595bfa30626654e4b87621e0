unix: fix a race condition in unix_release()

As reported by Jan, and others over the past few years, there is a
race condition caused by unix_release setting the sock->sk pointer
to NULL before properly marking the socket as dead/orphaned.  This
can cause a problem with the LSM hook security_unix_may_send() if
there is another socket attempting to write to this partially
released socket in between when sock->sk is set to NULL and it is
marked as dead/orphaned.  This patch fixes this by only setting
sock->sk to NULL after the socket has been marked as dead; I also
take the opportunity to make unix_release_sock() a void function
as it only ever returned 0/success.

Dave, I think this one should go on the -stable pile.

Special thanks to Jan for coming up with a reproducer for this
problem.
