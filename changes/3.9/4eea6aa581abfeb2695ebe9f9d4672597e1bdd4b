x86, mm: if kernel .text .data .bss are not marked as E820_RAM, complain and fix

There could be cases where user supplied memmap=exactmap memory
mappings do not mark the region where the kernel .text .data and
.bss reside as E820_RAM, as reported here:

https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/8/14/86

Handle it by complaining, and adding the range back into the e820.
