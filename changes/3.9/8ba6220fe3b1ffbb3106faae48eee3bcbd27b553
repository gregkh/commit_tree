[media] cx25840: Replace memcpy with struct assignment

This kind of memcpy() is error-prone. Its replacement with a struct
assignment is prefered because it's type-safe and much easier to read.
Found by coccinelle. Hand patched and reviewed.
Tested by compilation only.
A simplified version of the semantic match that finds this problem is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)
// <smpl>
@@
identifier struct_name;
struct struct_name to;
struct struct_name from;
expression E;
@@
-memcpy(&(to), &(from), E);
+to = from;
// </smpl>
