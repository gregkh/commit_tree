Btrfs: return EIO if we have extent tree corruption

The callers of lookup_inline_extent_info all handle getting an error back
properly, so return an error if we have corruption instead of being a jerk and
panicing.  Still WARN_ON() since this is kind of crucial and I've been seeing it
a bit too much recently for my taste, I think we're doing something wrong
somewhere.  Thanks,
