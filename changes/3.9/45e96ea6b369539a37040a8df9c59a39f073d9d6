KVM: ARM: Handle I/O aborts

When the guest accesses I/O memory this will create data abort
exceptions and they are handled by decoding the HSR information
(physical address, read/write, length, register) and forwarding reads
and writes to QEMU which performs the device emulation.

Certain classes of load/store operations do not support the syndrome
information provided in the HSR.  We don't support decoding these (patches
are available elsewhere), so we report an error to user space in this case.

This requires changing the general flow somewhat since new calls to run
the VCPU must check if there's a pending MMIO load and perform the write
after userspace has made the data available.
