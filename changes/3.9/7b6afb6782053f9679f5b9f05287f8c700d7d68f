ACPICA: Fix broken call depth tracing logic.

This patch does not affect the generation of the Linux binary.
This patch decreases 26 lines of 20121018 divergence.diff.

The ACPICA uses a call depth tracing mechanism by wrapping the return
statements with return macros and marking the entrance with
ACPI_FUNCTION_TRACE_ macros. There are other ACPI_FUNCTION_ macros used
to mark the functions not using this tracing mechanism.

This patch fixes broken call depth tracing logic.
