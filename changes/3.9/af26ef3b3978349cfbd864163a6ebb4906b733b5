drm/<drivers>: Unified handling of unimplemented fb->create_handle

Some drivers don't have real ->create_handle callbacks.

- cirrus/ast/mga200: Returns either 0 or -EINVAL.

- udl: Didn't even bother with a callback, leading to a nice
  userspace-triggerable OOPS.

- vmwgfx: This driver bothered with an implementation to return 0 as
  the handle (which is the canonical no-obj gem handle).

All have in common that ->create_handle doesn't really make too much
sense for them - that ioctl is used only for seamless fb takeover in
the radeon/nouveau/i915 ddx drivers. So allow drivers to not implement
this and return a consistent -ENODEV.
