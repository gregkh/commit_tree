net: Rewrite netif_reset_xps_queue to allow for better code reuse

This patch does a minor refactor on netif_reset_xps_queue to address a few
items I noticed.

First is the fact that we are doing removal of queues in both
netif_reset_xps_queue and netif_set_xps_queue.  Since there is no need to
have the code in two places I am pushing it out into a separate function
and will come back in another patch and reuse the code in
netif_set_xps_queue.

The second item this change addresses is the fact that the Tx queues were
not getting their numa_node value cleared as a part of the XPS queue reset.
This patch resolves that by resetting the numa_node value if the dev_maps
value is set.
