x86: Add Crash kernel low reservation

During kdump kernel's booting stage, it need to find low ram for
swiotlb buffer when system does not support intel iommu/dmar remapping.

kexed-tools is appending memmap=exactmap and range from /proc/iomem
with "Crash kernel", and that range is above 4G for 64bit after boot
protocol 2.12.

We need to add another range in /proc/iomem like "Crash kernel low",
so kexec-tools could find that info and append to kdump kernel
command line.

Try to reserve some under 4G if the normal "Crash kernel" is above 4G.

User could specify the size with crashkernel_low=XX[KMG].

-v2: fix warning that is found by Fengguang's test robot.
-v3: move out get_mem_size change to another patch, to solve compiling
     warning that is found by Borislav Petkov <bp@alien8.de>
-v4: user must specify crashkernel_low if system does not support
     intel or amd iommu.
