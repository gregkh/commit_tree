PCI: Don't try to disable Bus Master on disconnected PCI devices

This is a fix for commit 7897e60227 ("PCI: Disable Bus Master
unconditionally in pci_device_shutdown()").  Vivek reported that
with this commit, kexec failed because none of his SATA disks
came up.

A ->shutdown() callback might put the device in D3cold, which means config
space is no longer available.
