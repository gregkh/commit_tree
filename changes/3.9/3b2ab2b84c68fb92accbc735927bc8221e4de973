Revert "usb: Register usb port's acpi power resources"

This reverts commit 88bb965ed711e8a5984e70208ebc901a6ff4141f.

The linux-next branch of linux-pm tree has replaced
acpi_power_resource_(un)register_device() with new routines.
Commit 88bb965 will cause conflict in the linux-next tree.
So revert it and this will not affect other functions. Will
send a new patch with new routines after 3.9 merge window.
