ACPI: Remove the arguments of acpi_bus_add() that are not used

Notice that acpi_bus_add() uses only 2 of its 4 arguments and
redefine its header to match the body.  Update all of its callers as
necessary and observe that this leads to quite a number of removed
lines of code (Linus will like that).

Add a kerneldoc comment documenting acpi_bus_add() and wonder how
its callers make wrong assumptions about the second argument (make
note to self to take care of that later).
