sunrpc: Simplify auth_unix now that everything is a kgid_t

In unx_create_cred directly assign gids from acred->group_info
to cred->uc_gids.

In unx_match directly compare uc_gids with group_info.

Now that both group_info and unx_cred gids are stored as kgids
this is valid and the extra layer of translation can be removed.
