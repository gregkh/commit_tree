gianfar: Optimize struct gfar_priv_tx_q for two cache lines

Resize and regroup structure members to eliminate memory holes and
to pack the structure into 2 cache lines (from 3).
tx_ring_size was resized from 4 to 2 bytes and few members were re-grouped
in order to eliminate byte holes and achieve compactness.
Where possible, few members were grouped according to their usage and access
order (i.e. start_xmit vs. clean_tx_ring members), less important members
were pushed at the end.
