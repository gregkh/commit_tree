drivers/net: delete old x86 variant of the seeq8005 driver

The last update to the Ethernet HowTo (over 10 years ago) listed this:

 ------------------------
   SEEQ 8005

   Status: Obsolete, Driver Name: seeq8005

   There is little information about the card included in the driver,
   and hence little information to be put here. If you have a question,
   you are probably best trying to e-mail the driver author as listed
   in the source.

   It was marked obsolete as of the 2.4 series kernels.
 ------------------------

If it was obsolete over a decade ago, the situation can not have
improved with the passage of time, so let us act on that.  Even with
today's improved search engines, I was unable to locate any real
meaningful information on the ISA implementation of this rare chip.

There are ARM and SGI variants of the driver in tree, but they do
not depend on the original x86 driver source or header file.  We
leave those non-x86 drivers to be deleted by the arch maintainers
when they decide to expire those legacy platforms as a whole.
