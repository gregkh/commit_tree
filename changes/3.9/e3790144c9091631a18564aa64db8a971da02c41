mm: refactor inactive_file_is_low() to use get_lru_size()

An inactive file list is considered low when its active counterpart is
bigger, regardless of whether it is a global zone LRU list or a memcg
zone LRU list.  The only difference is in how the LRU size is assessed.

get_lru_size() does the right thing for both global and memcg reclaim
situations.

Get rid of inactive_file_is_low_global() and
mem_cgroup_inactive_file_is_low() by using get_lru_size() and compare
the numbers in common code.
