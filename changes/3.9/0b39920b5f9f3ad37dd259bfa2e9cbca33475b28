cfq-iosched: collect stats from dead cfqgs

To support hierarchical stats, it's necessary to remember stats from
dead children.  Add cfqg->dead_stats and make a dying cfqg transfer
its stats to the parent's dead-stats.

The transfer happens form ->pd_offline_fn() and it is possible that
there are some residual IOs completing afterwards.  Currently, we lose
these stats.  Given that cgroup removal isn't a very high frequency
operation and the amount of residual IOs on offline are likely to be
nil or small, this shouldn't be a big deal and the complexity needed
to handle residual IOs - another callback and rather elaborate
synchronization to reach and lock the matching q - doesn't seem
justified.
