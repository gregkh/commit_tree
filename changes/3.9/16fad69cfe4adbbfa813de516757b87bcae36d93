tcp: fix skb_availroom()

Chrome OS team reported a crash on a Pixel ChromeBook in TCP stack :

https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=182056

commit a21d45726acac (tcp: avoid order-1 allocations on wifi and tx
path) did a poor choice adding an 'avail_size' field to skb, while
what we really needed was a 'reserved_tailroom' one.

It would have avoided commit 22b4a4f22da (tcp: fix retransmit of
partially acked frames) and this commit.

Crash occurs because skb_split() is not aware of the 'avail_size'
management (and should not be aware)
