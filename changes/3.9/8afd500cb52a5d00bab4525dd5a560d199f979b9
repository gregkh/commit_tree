UBIFS: fix double free of ubifs_orphan objects

The last orphan in the dnext list has its dnext set to NULL. Because
of that, ubifs_delete_orphan assumes that it is not on the dnext list
and frees it immediately instead ignoring it as a second delete. The
orphan is later freed again by erase_deleted.

This change adds an explicit flag to ubifs_orphan indicating whether
it is pending delete.
