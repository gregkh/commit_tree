mm/fremap.c: fix oops on error path

If find_vma() fails, sys_remap_file_pages() will dereference `vma', which
contains NULL.  Fix it by checking the pointer.

(We could alternatively check for err==0, but this seems more direct)

(The vm_flags change is to squish a bogus used-uninitialised warning
without adding extra code).
