HID: fix Masterkit MA901 hid quirks

This patch reverts commit 0322bd3980 ("usb hid quirks for Masterkit MA901 usb
radio") and adds checks in hid_ignore() for Masterkit MA901 usb radio device.
This usb radio device shares USB ID with many Atmel V-USB (and probably other)
devices so patch sorts things out by checking name, vendor, product of hid device.
