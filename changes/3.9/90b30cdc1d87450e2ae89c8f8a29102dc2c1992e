memory-hotplug: export the function try_offline_node()

try_offline_node() will be needed in the tristate
drivers/acpi/processor_driver.c.

The node will be offlined when all memory/cpu on the node have been
hotremoved.  So we need the function try_offline_node() in cpu-hotplug
path.

If the memory-hotplug is disabled, and cpu-hotplug is enabled

1. no memory no the node
   we don't online the node, and cpu's node is the nearest node.

2. the node contains some memory
   the node has been onlined, and cpu's node is still needed
   to migrate the sleep task on the cpu to the same node.

So we do nothing in try_offline_node() in this case.
