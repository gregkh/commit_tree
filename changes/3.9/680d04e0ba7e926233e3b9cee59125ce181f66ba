VSOCK: vmci - fix possible info leak in vmci_transport_dgram_dequeue()

In case we received no data on the call to skb_recv_datagram(), i.e.
skb->data is NULL, vmci_transport_dgram_dequeue() will return with 0
without updating msg_namelen leading to net/socket.c leaking the local,
uninitialized sockaddr_storage variable to userland -- 128 bytes of
kernel stack memory.

Fix this by moving the already existing msg_namelen assignment a few
lines above.
