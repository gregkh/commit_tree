spi/pxa2xx: add support for DMA engine

To be able to use DMA with this driver on non-PXA platforms we implement
support for the generic DMA engine API. This lets user to use different DMA
engines with little or no modification to the driver.

Request lines and channel numbers can be passed to the driver from the
platform specific data.

The DMA engine implementation will be selected by default even on PXA
platform. User can select the legacy DMA API by enabling Kconfig option
CONFIG_SPI_PXA2XX_PXADMA.
