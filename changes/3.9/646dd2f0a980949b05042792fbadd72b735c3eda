ARM: S3C24XX: Fix interrupt pending register offset of the EINT controller

The external pending interrupt register address (EINTPEND) offset is
0xa8, not 0x08. Without this patch the external interrupts are not
properly acknowledged, which may lead to an interrupt storm and the
system hang as soon as any external interrupt is requested.
