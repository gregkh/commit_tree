irq_work: Flush work on CPU_DYING

In order not to offline a CPU with pending irq works, flush the
queue from CPU_DYING. The notifier is called by stop_machine on
the CPU that is going down. The code will not be called from irq context
(so things like get_irq_regs() wont work) but I'm not sure what the
requirements are for irq_work in that regard (Peter?). But irqs are
disabled and the CPU is about to go offline. Might as well flush the work.
