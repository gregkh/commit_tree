e1000e: prevent hardware from automatically configuring PHY on I217/I218

As done with the previous generation managed 82579, prevent the PHY from
being put into an unknown state by blocking the hardware from automatically
configuring the PHY as done with the previous generation managed 82579.
Instead, the driver should configure the PHY with contents of the EEPROM
image.
