lockdep: check that no locks held at freeze time

We shouldn't try_to_freeze if locks are held.  Holding a lock can cause a
deadlock if the lock is later acquired in the suspend or hibernate path
(e.g.  by dpm).  Holding a lock can also cause a deadlock in the case of
cgroup_freezer if a lock is held inside a frozen cgroup that is later
acquired by a process outside that group.
