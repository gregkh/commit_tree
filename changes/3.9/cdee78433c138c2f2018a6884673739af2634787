ext4: fix wrong m_len value after unwritten extent conversion

The ext4_ext_handle_uninitialized_extents() function was assuming the
return value of ext4_ext_map_blocks() is equal to map->m_len.  This
incorrect assumption was harmless until we started use status tree as
a extent cache because we need to update status tree according to
'm_len' value.

Meanwhile this commit marks EXT4_MAP_MAPPED flag after unwritten extent
conversion.  It shouldn't cause a bug because we update status tree
according to checking EXT4_MAP_UNWRITTEN flag.  But it should be fixed.

After applied this commit, the following error message from self-testing
infrastructure disappears.

    ...
    kernel: ES len assertation failed for inode: 230 retval 1 !=
    map->m_len 3 in ext4_map_blocks (allocation)
    ...
