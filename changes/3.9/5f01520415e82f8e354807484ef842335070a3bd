dm: merge io_pool and tio_pool

This patch merges io_pool and tio_pool into io_pool and cleans up
related functions.

Though device-mapper used to have 2 pools of objects for each dm device,
the use of bioset frontbad for per-bio data has shrunk the number of
pools to 1 for both bio-based and request-based device types.
(See c0820cf5 "dm: introduce per_bio_data" and
 94818742 "dm: Use bioset's front_pad for dm_rq_clone_bio_info")

So dm no longer has to maintain 2 different pointers.

No functional changes.
