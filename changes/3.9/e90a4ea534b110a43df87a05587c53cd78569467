drm/udl: Inline memcmp() for RLE compression of xfer

As we use a variable length the compiler does not realise that it is a
fixed value of either 2 or 4 bytes. Instead of performing the inline
comparison itself, the compiler inserts a function call to the generic
memcmp routine which is optimised for long comparisons of variable
length. That turns out to be quite expensive...
