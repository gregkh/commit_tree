ARM: OMAP: AM33xx hwmod: Corrects PWM subsystem HWMOD entries

EQEP IP block integration data is not present in HWMOD data. Also
address ranges specified for EACP & EHRPWM are not correct & HWMOD
flags of ADDR_TYPE_RT are added to PWM subsystem register address
space. This patch:
1. Corrects register address mapping for ECAP & EHRPWM
2. Removes  HWMOD flags in PWM submodule register address space.
3. Adds EQEP HWMOD entries.
