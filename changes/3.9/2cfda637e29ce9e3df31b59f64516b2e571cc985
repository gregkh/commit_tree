EISA/PCI: Fix bus res reference

Matthew found that 3.8.3 is having problems with an old (ancient)
PCI-to-EISA bridge, the Intel 82375. It worked with the 3.2 kernel.
He identified the 82375, but doesn't assign the struct resource *res
pointer inside the struct eisa_root_device, and panics.

pci_eisa_init() was using bus->resource[] directly instead of
pci_bus_resource_n().  The bus->resource[] array is a PCI-internal
implementation detail, and after commit 45ca9e97 (PCI: add helpers for
building PCI bus resource lists) and commit 0efd5aab (PCI: add struct
pci_host_bridge_window with CPU/bus address offset), bus->resource[] is not
used for PCI root buses any more.

The 82375 is a subtractive-decode PCI device, so handle it the same
way we handle PCI-PCI bridges in subtractive-decode mode in
pci_read_bridge_bases().
