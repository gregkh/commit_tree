[SCSI] qla4xxx: Re-register IRQ handler while retrying initialize of adapter

Problem:
If initialization of adapter fails for some reason, then the interrupt handlers
are released. The interrupt handlers are not registered again when initialization
of adapter is retried.

Solution:
Re-register the interrupt handler when adapter initialization is retried.
