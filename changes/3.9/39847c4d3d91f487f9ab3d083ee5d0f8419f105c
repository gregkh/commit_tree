Btrfs: fix wrong reservation of csums

We reserve the space for csums only when we write data into a file, in
the other cases, such as tree log, log replay, we don't do reservation,
so we can use the reservation of the transaction handle just for the former.
And for the latter, we should use the tree's own reservation. But the
function - btrfs_csum_file_blocks() didn't differentiate between these
two types of the cases, fix it.
