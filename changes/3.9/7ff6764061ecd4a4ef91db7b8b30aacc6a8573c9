usermodehelper: cleanup/fix __orderly_poweroff() && argv_free()

__orderly_poweroff() does argv_free() if call_usermodehelper_fns()
returns -ENOMEM.  As Lucas pointed out, this can be wrong if -ENOMEM was
not triggered by the failing call_usermodehelper_setup(), in this case
both __orderly_poweroff() and argv_cleanup() can do kfree().

Kill argv_cleanup() and change __orderly_poweroff() to call argv_free()
unconditionally like do_coredump() does.  This info->cleanup() is not
needed (and wrong) since 6c0c0d4d "fix bug in orderly_poweroff() which
did the UMH_NO_WAIT => UMH_WAIT_EXEC change, we can rely on the fact
that CLONE_VFORK can't return until do_execve() succeeds/fails.
