uprobes: Kill uprobes_mutex[], separate alloc_uprobe() and __uprobe_register()

uprobe_register() and uprobe_unregister() are the only users of
mutex_lock(uprobes_hash(inode)), and the only reason why we can't
simply remove it is that we need to ensure that delete_uprobe() is
not possible after alloc_uprobe() and before consumer_add().

IOW, we need to ensure that when we take uprobe->register_rwsem
this uprobe is still valid and we didn't race with _unregister()
which called delete_uprobe() in between.

With this patch uprobe_register() simply checks uprobe_is_active()
and retries if it hits this very unlikely race. uprobes_mutex[] is
no longer needed and can be removed.

There is another reason for this change, prepare_uprobe() should be
folded into alloc_uprobe() and we do not want to hold the extra locks
around read_mapping_page/etc.
