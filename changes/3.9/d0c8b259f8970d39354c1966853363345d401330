target/iblock: Use backend REQ_FLUSH hint for WriteCacheEnabled status

This patch allows IBLOCK to check block hints in request_queue->flush_flags
when reporting current backend device WriteCacheEnabled status to a remote
SCSI initiator port.

This is done via a se_subsystem_api->get_write_cache() call instead of a
backend se_device creation time flag, as we expect REQ_FLUSH bits to possibly
change from an underlying blk_queue_flush() by the SCSI disk driver, or
internal raw struct block_device driver usage.

Also go ahead and update iblock_execute_rw() bio I/O path code to use
REQ_FLUSH + REQ_FUA hints when determining WRITE_FUA usage, and make SPC
emulation code use a spc_check_dev_wce() helper to handle both types of
cases for virtual backend subsystem drivers.

(asias: Drop unnecessary comparsion operators)
