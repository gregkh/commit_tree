nbd: fix sparse warning

I just fixed this in "drivers/block/rbd.c" and I noticed that
"drivers/block/nbd.c" has the same problem.  Fix a warning issued by
sparse by adding some lockdep annotations to indicate the queue lock gets
dropped (because it's held when do_nbd_request() is called) and
re-acquired within the function.
