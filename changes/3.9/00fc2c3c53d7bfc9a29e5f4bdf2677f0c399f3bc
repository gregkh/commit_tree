drm/i915: Remove gtt_mappable_total

With the assertion from the previous patch in place, it should be safe
to get rid gtt_mappable_total. Keeps things saner to not have to track
the same info in two places.

In order to keep the diff as simple as possible and keep with the
existing gtt_setup semantics we opt to keep gtt_mappable_end. It's not
as consistent with the 'total' used in the previous patch, but that can
be fixed later.
