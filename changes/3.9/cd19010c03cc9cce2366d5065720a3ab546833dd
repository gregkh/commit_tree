ARM: OMAP2+: PM: Fix the dt return condition in pm_late_init()

Commit 1416408d {ARM: OMAP2+: PM: share some suspend-related functions
across OMAP2, 3, 4} moved suspend code to common place but now with
that change, for DT build on OMAP4, suspend hooks are not getting
registered which results in no suspend support.

The DT return condition is limited to PMIC and smartreflex
initialization and hence restrict it so that suspend ops gets
registered.
