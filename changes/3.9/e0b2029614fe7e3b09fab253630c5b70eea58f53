sparc: delete "if !ULTRA_HAS_POPULATION_COUNT"

Commit 2d78d4beb64eb07d50665432867971c481192ebf ("[PATCH] bitops:
sparc64: use generic bitops") made the default of GENERIC_HWEIGHT depend
on !ULTRA_HAS_POPULATION_COUNT. But since there's no Kconfig symbol with
that name, this always evaluates to true. Delete this dependency.
