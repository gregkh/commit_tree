powerpc: Hook up doorbells on server

This patch actually hooks up doorbell interrupts on POWER8:

- Select the PPC_DOORBELL Kconfig option from PPC_PSERIES

- Add the doorbell CPU feature bit to POWER8

- We define a new pSeries_cause_ipi_mux() function that issues a
  doorbell interrupt if the recipient is another thread within the same
  core as the sender. If the recipient is in a different core it falls
  back to using XICS to deliver the IPI as before.

- During pSeries_smp_probe() at boot, we check if doorbell interrupts
  are supported. If they are we set the cause_ipi function pointer to
  the above mentioned function, otherwise we leave it as whichever XICS
  cause_ipi function was determined by xics_smp_probe().
