sched: Bail out of yield_to when source and target runqueue has one task

In case of undercomitted scenarios, especially in large guests
yield_to overhead is significantly high. when run queue length of
source and target is one, take an opportunity to bail out and return
-ESRCH. This return condition can be further exploited to quickly come
out of PLE handler.

(History: Raghavendra initially worked on break out of kvm ple handler upon
 seeing source runqueue length = 1, but it had to export rq length).
 Peter came up with the elegant idea of return -ESRCH in scheduler core.

Raghavendra, Checking the rq length of target vcpu condition added.(thanks Avi)
