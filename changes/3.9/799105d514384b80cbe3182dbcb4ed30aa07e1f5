cgroups: fix cgroup_event_listener error handling

The error handling in cgroup_event_listener.c did not correctly deal
with either an error opening either <control_file> or
cgroup.event_control.  Due to an uninitialized variable the program
exit code was undefined if either of these opens failed.

This patch simplifies and corrects cgroup_event_listener.c error
handling by:
1. using err*() rather than printf(),exit()
2. depending on process exit to close open files

With this patch failures always return non-zero error.
