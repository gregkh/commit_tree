mmc: core: Break out start_signal_voltage_switch

Allow callers to access the start_signal_voltage_switch host_ops
member without going through any cmd11 logic. This is mostly a
preparation for the following signal voltage switch patch.

Also, reset ios.signal_voltage to its original value if
start_signal_voltage_switch fails.
