ALSA: hda - Fix snd_hda_get_num_raw_conns() to return a correct value

In the connection list expansion in hda_codec.c and hda_proc.c, the
value returned from snd_hda_get_num_raw_conns() is used as the array
size to store the connection list.  However, the function returns
simply a raw value of the AC_PAR_CONNLIST_LEN parameter, and the
widget list with ranges isn't considered there.  Thus it may return a
smaller size than the actual list, which results in -ENOSPC in
snd_hda_get_raw_conections().

This patch fixes the bug by parsing the connection list correctly also
for snd_hda_get_num_raw_conns().
