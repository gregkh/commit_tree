arm: arch_timer: divorce from local_timer api

Currently, the arch_timer driver is tied to the arm port, as it relies
on code in arch/arm/smp.c to setup and teardown timers as cores are
hotplugged on and off. The timer is registered through an arm-specific
registration mechanism, preventing sharing the driver with the arm64
port.

This patch moves the driver to using a cpu notifier instead, making it
easier to port.
