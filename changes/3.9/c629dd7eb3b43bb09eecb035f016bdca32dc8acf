HID: multitouch: fix Win8 protocol for Sharp like devices

The Sharp LC-20FE1-W screen (04dd:9681) behaves like the Nexio 42".
It may report out of ranges values that are filtered out by relying
on the Contact Count HID field.
Adding the quirk MT_QUIRK_CONTACT_CNT_ACCURATE makes hid-multitouch
strongest against this kind of device, without breaking the current
devices.
