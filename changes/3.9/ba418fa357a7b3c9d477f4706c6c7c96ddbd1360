soreuseport: UDP/IPv4 implementation

Allow multiple UDP sockets to bind to the same port.

Motivation soreuseport would be something like a DNS server.  An
alternative would be to recv on the same socket from multiple threads.
As in the case of TCP, the load across these threads tends to be
disproportionate and we also see a lot of contection on the socketlock.
Note that SO_REUSEADDR already allows multiple UDP sockets to bind to
the same port, however there is no provision to prevent hijacking and
nothing to distribute packets across all the sockets sharing the same
bound port.  This patch does not change the semantics of SO_REUSEADDR,
but provides usable functionality of it for unicast.
