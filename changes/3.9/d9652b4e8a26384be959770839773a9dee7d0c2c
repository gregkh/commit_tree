ACPICA: iASL/Disassembler: Add option to ignore NOOP opcodes/operators

Implemented for both the compiler and the disassembler.  Often,
the NOOP opcode is used as padding for packages that are changed
dynamically by the BIOS. When disassembled, these NOOPs will
cause syntax errors. This option causes the disassembler to ignore
the NOOP opcode, and it also causes the compiler to ignore NOOP
statements as well.
