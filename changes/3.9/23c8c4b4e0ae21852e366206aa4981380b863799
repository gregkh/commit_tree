ARM: tegra: enable ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB for Tegra114

CONFIG_ARCH_TEGRA_114_SOC doesn't currently enable gpiolib, which causes
numerous build problems building a Tegra kernel with only Tegra114
enabled, and not Tegra20 or Tegra30. Enable ARCH_REQUIRE_GPIOLIB to
solve this. However, all Tegra will use gpiolib, so select this option
from ARCH_TEGRA rather than each individual ARCH_TEGRA_*_SOC, to
prevent this problem for any future chips.
