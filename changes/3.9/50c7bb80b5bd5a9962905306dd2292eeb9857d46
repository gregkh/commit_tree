KVM: PPC: Book3S: PR: Enable alternative instruction for SC 1

When running on top of pHyp, the hypercall instruction "sc 1" goes
straight into pHyp without trapping in supervisor mode.

So if we want to support PAPR guest in this configuration we need to
add a second way of accessing PAPR hypercalls, preferably with the
exact same semantics except for the instruction.

So let's overlay an officially reserved instruction and emulate PAPR
hypercalls whenever we hit that one.
