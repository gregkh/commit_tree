KMS: fix EDID detailed timing vsync parsing

EDID spreads some values across multiple bytes; bit-fiddling is needed
to retrieve these.  The current code to parse "detailed timings" has a
cut&paste error that results in a vsync offset of at most 15 lines
instead of 63.

See

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EDID

and in the "EDID Detailed Timing Descriptor" see bytes 10+11 show why
that needs to be a left shift.
