pwm: core: Rename of_pwm_request() to of_pwm_get() and export it

Allow client driver to use of_pwm_get() to get the PWM they need. This
is needed for drivers which handle more than one PWM separately, like
leds-pwm driver, which have:

pwmleds {
	compatible = "pwm-leds";
	kpad {
		label = "omap4::keypad";
		pwms = <&twl_pwm 0 7812500>;
		max-brightness = <127>;
	};

	charging {
		label = "omap4:green:chrg";
		pwms = <&twl_pwmled 0 7812500>;
		max-brightness = <255>;
	};
};

in the dts files.
