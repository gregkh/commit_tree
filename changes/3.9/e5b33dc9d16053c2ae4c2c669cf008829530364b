USB: serial: add modem-status-change wait queue

Add modem-status-change wait queue to struct usb_serial_port that
subdrivers can use to implement TIOCMIWAIT.

Currently subdrivers use a private wait queue which may have been
released when waking up after device disconnected.

Note that we're adding a new wait queue rather than reusing the tty-port
one as we do not want to get woken up at hangup (yet).
