parisc: fixes and cleanups in page cache flushing (1/4)

This is the first patch in a series of 4, with which the page cache flushing of
parisc will gets fixed and enhanced. This even fixes the nasty "minifail" bug
(http://wiki.parisc-linux.org/TestCases?highlight=%28minifail%29) which
prevented parisc to stay an official debian port.  Basically the flush in
copy_user_page together with the TLB patch from commit
7139bc1579901b53db7e898789e916ee2fb52d78 is what fixes the minifail bug.

This patch still uses the TMPALIAS approach.  The new copy_user_page
implementation calls flush_dcache_page_asm to flush the user dcache page
(crucial for minifail fix) via a kernel TMPALIAS mapping.  After that, it just
copies the page using the kernel mapping.  It does a final flush if needed.
Generally it is hard to avoid doing some cache flushes using the kernel mapping
(e.g., copy_to_user_page and copy_from_user_page).

This patch depends on a subsequent change to pacache.S implementing
clear_page_asm and copy_page_asm.  These are optimized routines to clear and
copy a page.  The calls in clear_user_page and copy_user_page could be replaced
by calls to memset and memcpy, respectively.  I tested prefetch optimizations
in clear_page_asm and copy_page_asm but didn't see any significant performance
improvement on rp3440.  I'm not sure if these are routines are significantly
faster than memset and/or memcpy, but they are there for further performance
evaluation.
