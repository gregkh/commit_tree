goldfish: NAND flash driver

Fold together the NAND driver for Goldfish from Arve with cleanups by
Jun Nakajima and a tidy up to 3.7 and checkpatch.

This provides a virtual flash driver for the Goldfish Android Virtual Platform,
and which is normally used as the root file system when testing emulated
devices.
