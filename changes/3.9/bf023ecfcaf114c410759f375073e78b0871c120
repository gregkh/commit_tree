Btrfs: eliminate a use-after-free in btrfs_balance()

Commit 5af3e8cc introduced a use-after-free at volumes.c:3139: bctl is freed
above in __cancel_balance() in all cases except for balance pause.  Fix this
by moving the offending check a couple statements above, the meaning of the
check is preserved.
