bnx2x: Support statistics collection for VFs by the PF

Statistics are collected by the PF driver. The collection is
performed via a query sent to the device which is basically an array
of 3-tuples of the form (statistics client, function, DMAE address).
In this patch the PF driver adds to the query, on top of the
statistics clients it is maintaining for itself (rss queues, storage,
etc), the 3-tuples for the VFs it is maintaining. The addresses used
are the GPAs of the statistics buffers supplied by the VF in the
init message on the VF <-> PF channel. The function parameter
ensures that the iommu will translate the GPA to the correct physical
address.
