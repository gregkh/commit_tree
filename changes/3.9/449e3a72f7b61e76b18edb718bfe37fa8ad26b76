Documentation: update top level 00-INDEX file with new additions

It seems there are about 80 new, but undocumented addtions at
the top level Documentation directory.  This fixes up the top
level 00-INDEX by adding new entries and deleting a couple orphans.
Some subdirs could probably still use a check/cleanup too though.
