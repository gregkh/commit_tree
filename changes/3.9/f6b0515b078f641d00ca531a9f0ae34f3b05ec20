cpufreq: Only call cpufreq_out_of_sync() for driver that implement cpufreq_driver.target()

Scaling drivers that implement cpufreq_driver.setpolicy() have
internal governors that do not signal changes via
cpufreq_notify_transition() so the frequncy in the policy will almost
certainly be different than the current frequncy.  Only call
cpufreq_out_of_sync() when the underlying driver implements
cpufreq_driver.target()
