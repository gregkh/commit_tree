[media] media: davinci: vpbe: enable building of vpbe driver for DM355 and DM365

This patch allows enabling building of VPBE display driver for DM365
and DM355. This also removes unnecessary entry VIDEO_DM644X_VPBE
in Kconfig, which could have been done with single entry, and
appropriate changes in Makefile for building.
