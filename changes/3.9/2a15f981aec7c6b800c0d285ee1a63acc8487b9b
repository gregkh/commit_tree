mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: Auto CMD23 support for usdhc

SDHCI core will try to use Auto CMD23 for mmc card.  Currently, we will
see the following message with mmc card on usdhc due to the lacking of
Auto CMD23 support in the driver.

$ mmc0: new high speed MMC card at address 0001
mmcblk1: mmc0:0001 MMC02G 1.87 GiB
mmcblk1: error -84 transferring data, sector 0, nr 8, cmd response 0x900, card status 0xb00
mmcblk1: retrying using single block read
 mmcblk1:

Enable Auto CMD23 support for usdhc so that mmc card can work in
multiple block mode.
