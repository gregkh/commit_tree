KVM: PPC: BookE: Allow irq deliveries to inject requests

When injecting an interrupt into guest context, we usually don't need
to check for requests anymore. At least not until today.

With the introduction of EPR, we will have to create a request when the
guest has successfully accepted an external interrupt though.

So we need to prepare the interrupt delivery to abort guest entry
gracefully. Otherwise we'd delay the EPR request.
