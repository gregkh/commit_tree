[media] s5p-fimc: fix s5pv210 build

56bc911 "[media] s5p-fimc: Redefine platform data structure for fimc-is"
changed the bus_type member of struct fimc_source_info treewide, but
got one instance wrong in mach-s5pv210, which was evidently not
even build tested.

This adds the missing change to get s5pv210_defconfig to build again.
Applies on the Mauro's media tree.
