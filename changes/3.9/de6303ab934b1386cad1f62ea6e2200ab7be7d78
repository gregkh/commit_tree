watchdog: add new driver for STMP3xxx and i.MX23/28

Replace the existing STMP3xxx driver because it has enough drawbacks
that a rewrite is apropriate. The new driver is designed to use the
watchdog framework which makes it a lot smaller and avoids open coding
the watchdog API again. It also uses now an explicitly exported function
from the RTC driver to set up its registers (the old driver silently
reused the hopefully(!) already remapped RTC registers). Also, this
driver is mach independent, while the old one depends on a mach replaced
by another one a year ago. Since the user interface is still the
standard watchdog API, users don't need to adapt.
