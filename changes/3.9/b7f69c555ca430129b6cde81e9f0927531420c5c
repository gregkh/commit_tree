KVM: Minor memory slot optimization

If a slot is removed or moved in the guest physical address space, we
first allocate and install a new slot array with the invalidated
entry.  The old array is then freed.  We then proceed to allocate yet
another slot array to install the permanent replacement.  Re-use the
original array when this occurs and avoid the extra kfree/kmalloc.
