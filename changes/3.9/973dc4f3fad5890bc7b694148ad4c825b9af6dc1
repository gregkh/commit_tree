x86, mm: Remove early_memremap workaround for page table accessing on 64bit

We try to put page table high to make room for kdump, and at that time
those ranges are not mapped yet, and have to use ioremap to access it.

Now after patch that pre-map page table top down.
	x86, mm: setup page table in top-down
We do not need that workaround anymore.

Just use __va to return directly mapping address.
