NTP: Add a CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC configuration

The purpose of this option is to allow ARM/etc systems that rely on the
class RTC subsystem to have the same kind of automatic NTP based
synchronization that we have on PC platforms. Today ARM does not
implement update_persistent_clock and makes extensive use of the class
RTC system.

When enabled CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC will provide a generic
rtc_update_persistent_clock that stores the current time in the RTC and
is intended complement the existing CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS option that loads
the RTC at boot.

Like with RTC_HCTOSYS the platform's update_persistent_clock is used
first, if it works. Platforms with mixed class RTC and non-RTC drivers
need to return ENODEV when class RTC should be used. Such an update for
PPC is included in this patch.

Long term, implementations of update_persistent_clock should migrate to
proper class RTC drivers and use CONFIG_RTC_SYSTOHC instead.

Tested on ARM kirkwood and PPC405
