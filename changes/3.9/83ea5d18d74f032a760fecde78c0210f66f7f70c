ALSA: snd-usb: mixer: ignore -EINVAL in snd_usb_mixer_controls()

Creation of individual mixer controls may fail, but that shouldn't cause
the entire mixer creation to fail. Even worse, if the mixer creation
fails, that will error out the entire device probing.

All the functions called by parse_audio_unit() should return -EINVAL if
they find descriptors that are unsupported or believed to be malformed,
so we can safely handle this error code as a non-fatal condition in
snd_usb_mixer_controls().

That fixes a long standing bug which is commonly worked around by
adding quirks which make the driver ignore entire interfaces. Some of
them might now be unnecessary.
