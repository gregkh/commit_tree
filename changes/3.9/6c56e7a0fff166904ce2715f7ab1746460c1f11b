mmc: provide a standard MMC device-tree binding parser centrally

MMC defines a number of standard DT bindings. Having each driver parse
them individually adds code redundancy and is error prone. Provide a
standard function to unify the parsing. After all drivers are converted
to using it instead of their own parsers, this function can be integrated
into mmc_alloc_host().
