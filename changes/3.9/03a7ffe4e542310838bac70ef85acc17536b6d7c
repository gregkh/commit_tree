pps: Use pps_lookup_dev to reduce ldisc coupling

Now that N_TTY uses tty->disc_data for its private data,
'subclass' ldiscs cannot use ->disc_data for their own private data.
(This is a regression is v3.8-rc1)

Use pps_lookup_dev to associate the tty with the pps source instead.

This fixes a crashing regression in 3.8-rc1.
