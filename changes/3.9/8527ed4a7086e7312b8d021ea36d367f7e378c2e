parisc: fix compile warnings triggered by atomic_sub(sizeof(),v)

This fixes compile warnings like this one:
net/ipv4/igmp.c: In function ‘ip_mc_leave_group’:
net/ipv4/igmp.c:1898:3: warning: overflow in implicit constant conversion [-Woverflow]

atomic_sub() is defined as __atomic_add_return(-(VAL),(v))))
and if VAL is of type unsigned int (as returned by sizeof()), negating
this value will overflow. Fix this by type-casting VAL to int type.
