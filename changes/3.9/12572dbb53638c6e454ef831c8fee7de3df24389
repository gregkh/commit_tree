clockevents: Add generic timer broadcast receiver

Currently the broadcast mechanism used for timers is abstracted by a
function pointer on struct clock_event_device. As the fundamental
mechanism for broadcast is architecture-specific, this ties each
clock_event_device driver to a single architecture, even where the
driver is otherwise generic.

This patch adds a standard path for the receipt of timer broadcasts, so
drivers and/or architecture backends need not manage redundant lists of
timers for the purpose of routing broadcast timer ticks.

[tglx: Made the implementation depend on the config switch as well ]
