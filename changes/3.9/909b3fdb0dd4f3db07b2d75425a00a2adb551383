xen-pciback: notify hypervisor about devices intended to be assigned to guests

For MSI-X capable devices the hypervisor wants to write protect the
MSI-X table and PBA, yet it can't assume that resources have been
assigned to their final values at device enumeration time. Thus have
pciback do that notification, as having the device controlled by it is
a prerequisite to assigning the device to guests anyway.

This is the kernel part of hypervisor side commit 4245d33 ("x86/MSI:
add mechanism to fully protect MSI-X table from PV guest accesses") on
the master branch of git://xenbits.xen.org/xen.git.
