OF: Fixup resursive locking code paths

There is no real reason to use a rwlock for devtree_lock. It even
could be a mutex, but unfortunately it's locked from cpu hotplug
paths which can't schedule :(

So it needs to become a raw lock on rt as well.  The devtree_lock would
be the only user of a raw_rw_lock, so we are better off cleaning up the
recursive locking paths which allows us to convert devtree_lock to a
read_lock.

Here we do the standard thing of introducing __foo() as the "raw"
version of foo(), so that we can take better control of the locking.
The "raw" versions are not exported and are for internal use within
the file itself.
