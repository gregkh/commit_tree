ACPICA: Cleanup ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT macros to fix potential build breakages.

Fix two issues with the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT macros.
1) Add the ACPI_DO_WHILE0 macro to the main DEBUG_PRINT helper macro.
2) Rename ACPI_DEBUG macro to ACPI_DO_DEBUG_PRINT since ACPI_DEBUG
   is already commonly used by the various hosts.
