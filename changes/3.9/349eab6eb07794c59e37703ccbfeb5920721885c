x86/process: Change %8s to %s for pr_warn() in release_thread()

the length of dead_task->comm[] is 16 (TASK_COMM_LEN)
on pr_warn(), it is not meaningful to use %8s for task->comm[].

So change it to %s, since the line is not solid anyway.

Additional information:

 %8s  limit the width, not for the original string output length
      if name length is more than 8, it still can be fully displayed.
      if name length is less than 8, the ' ' will be filled before name.

 %.8s truly limit the original string output length (precision)
