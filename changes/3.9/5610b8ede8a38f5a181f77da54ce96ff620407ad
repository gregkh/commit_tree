ARM: OMAP2+: AM33XX: omap2plus_defconfig: Add support for few drivers

Adds tps65910 PMIC, lis3lv02d accelerometer, tsl2550 ambient light sensor,
tmp275 temperature sensor, matrix keypad, gbio based leds and D_CAN drivers
support. These peripherals are present on AM33XX family of devices (EVM,
BeagleBone and EVMSK). One has to manually enable these support to use the
drivers, so this patch enables all the drivers in omap2plus_defconfig
