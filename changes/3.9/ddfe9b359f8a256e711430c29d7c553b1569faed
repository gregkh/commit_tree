cris: use "int" for ssize_t to match size_t

On cris-linux-gcc, __SIZE_TYPE__ expands to "unsigned int", as
gcc-4.6.3-nolibc/cris-linux/lib/gcc/cris-linux/4.6.3/plugin/include/config/cris/linux.h
has

    #define SIZE_TYPE "unsigned int"

Hence __kernel_size_t is also "unsigned int".  But __kernel_ssize_t is
"long", which has a different base type, causing compiler warnings like:

    fs/quota/quota_tree.c:372:4: warning: format '%zd' expects argument of type 'signed size_t', but argument 4 has type 'ssize_t' [-Wformat]

To fix this, __kernel_ssize_t should be changed to "int". Hence cris can
just use the generic 32-bit versions from include/asm-generic/posix_types.h
for all size-related types.
