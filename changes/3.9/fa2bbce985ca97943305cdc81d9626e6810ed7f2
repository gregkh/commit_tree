x86, 64bit: Copy struct boot_params early

We want to support struct boot_params (formerly known as the
zero-page, or real-mode data) above the 4 GiB mark.  We will have #PF
handler to set page table for not accessible ram early, but want to
limit it before x86_64_start_reservations to limit the code change to
native path only.

Also we will need the ramdisk info in struct boot_params to access the microcode
blob in ramdisk in x86_64_start_kernel, so copy struct boot_params early makes
it accessing ramdisk info simple.
