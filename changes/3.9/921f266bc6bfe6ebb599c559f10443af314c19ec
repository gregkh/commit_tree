ext4: add self-testing infrastructure to do a sanity check

This commit adds a self-testing infrastructure like extent tree does to
do a sanity check for extent status tree.  After status tree is as a
extent cache, we'd better to make sure that it caches right result.

After applied this commit, we will get a lot of messages when we run
xfstests as below.
