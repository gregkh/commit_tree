irda: buffer overflow in irnet_ctrl_read()

The comments here say that the /* Max event is 61 char */ but in 2003 we
changed the event format and now the max event size is 75.  The longest
event is:

	"Discovered %08x (%s) behind %08x {hints %02X-%02X}\n",
         12345678901    23  456789012    34567890    1    2 3
	            +8    +21        +8          +2   +2     +1
         = 75 characters.

There was a check to return -EOVERFLOW if the user gave us a "count"
value that was less than 64.  Raising it to 75 might break backwards
compatability.  Instead I removed the check and now it returns a
truncated string if "count" is too low.
