sched: Fix /proc/sched_debug failure on very very large systems

On systems with 4096 cores attemping to read /proc/sched_debug
fails because we are trying to push all the data into a single
kmalloc buffer.

The issue is on these very large machines all the data will not
fit in 4mb.

A better solution is to not us the single_open mechanism but to
provide our own seq_operations and treat each cpu as an
individual record.

The output should be identical to the previous version.
