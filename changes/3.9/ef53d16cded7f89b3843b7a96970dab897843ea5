ksm: allocate roots when needed

It is a pity to have MAX_NUMNODES+MAX_NUMNODES tree roots statically
allocated, particularly when very few users will ever actually tune
merge_across_nodes 0 to use more than 1+1 of those trees.  Not a big
deal (only 16kB wasted on each machine with CONFIG_MAXSMP), but a pity.

Start off with 1+1 statically allocated, then if merge_across_nodes is
ever tuned, allocate for nr_node_ids+nr_node_ids.  Do not attempt to
free up the extra if it's tuned back, that would be a waste of effort.
