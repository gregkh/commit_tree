mmc: dw_mmc: exynos: Remove code for wp-gpios

The exynos code claimed the write protect with devm_gpio_request() but
never did anything with it.  That meant that anyone using a write
protect GPIO would effectively be write protected all the time.

The handling for wp-gpios belongs in the main dw_mmc driver and has
been moved there.
