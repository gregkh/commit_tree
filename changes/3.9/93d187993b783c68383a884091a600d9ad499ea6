drm/i915: Remove use of gtt_mappable_entries

Mappable_end, ie. size is almost always what you want as opposed to the
number of entries. Since we already have that information, we can scrap
the number of entries and only calculate it when needed.

If gtt_start is !0, this will have slightly different behavior. This
difference can only occur in DRI1, and exists when we try to kick out
the firmware fb. The new code seems like a bugfix to me.

The other case where we've changed the behavior is during init we check
the mappable region against our current known upper and lower limits
(64MB, and 512MB). This now matches the comment, and makes things more
convenient after removing gtt_mappable_entries.

Also worth noting is the setting of mappable_end is taken out of setup
because we do it earlier now in the DRI2 case and therefore need to add
that tiny hunk to support the DRI1 IOCTL.

v2: Move up mappable end to before legacy AGP init

v3: Add the dev_priv inclusion here from previous rebase error in patch
