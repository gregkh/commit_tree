ARM: tegra: update the cache maintenance order for CPU shutdown

Updating the cache maintenance order before CPU shutdown when doing CPU
hotplug.
The old order:
* clean L1 by flush_cache_all
* exit SMP
* CPU shutdown
Adapt to:
* disable L1 data cache by clear C bit
* clean L1 by v7_flush_dcache_louis
* exit SMP
* CPU shutdown

For CPU hotplug case, it's no need to do "flush_cache_all". And we should
disable L1 data cache before clean L1 data cache. Then leaving the SMP
coherency.
