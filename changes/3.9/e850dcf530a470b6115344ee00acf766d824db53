ksm: trivial tidyups

Add NUMA() and DO_NUMA() macros to minimize blight of #ifdef
CONFIG_NUMAs (but indeed we don't want to expand struct rmap_item by nid
when not NUMA).  Add comment, remove "unsigned" from rmap_item->nid, as
"int nid" elsewhere.  Define ksm_merge_across_nodes 1U when #ifndef NUMA
to help optimizing out.  Use ?: in get_kpfn_nid().  Adjust a few
comments noticed in ongoing work.

Leave stable_tree_insert()'s rb_linkage until after the node has been
set up, as unstable_tree_search_insert() does: ksm_thread_mutex and page
lock make either way safe, but we're going to copy and I prefer this
precedent.
