pinctrl: skip deferral of hogs

Up until now, as hogs were always taken at the end of the
pin control device registration, it didn't cause any problem.
But when starting to hog pins from the device core it will
cause deferral of the pin controller device itself since the
default pin fetch is done *before* the device probes, so
let's fix this annoyance (which is also aesthetically ugly).

Also take some care to make sure that if any one map entry
results in a deferral rather than a failure, then that
deferral will take precedence.
