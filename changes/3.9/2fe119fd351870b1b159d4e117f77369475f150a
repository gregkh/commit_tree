Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _FLASH2X_VENDORSPECIFIC_INFO and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _FLASH2X_VENDORSPECIFIC_INFO,
and changes the name of the struct to bcm_flash2x_vendor_info.
In addition, any calls to typedefs FLASH2X_VENDORSPECIFIC_INFO,
or *PFLASH2X_VENDORSPECIFIC_INFO are changed to call the
struct directly.
