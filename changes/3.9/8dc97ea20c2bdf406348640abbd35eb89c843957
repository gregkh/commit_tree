[media] sta2x11_vip: convert to videobuf2, control framework, file handler

This patch re-write the driver and use the videobuf2
interface instead of the old videobuf. Moreover, it uses also
the control framework which allows the driver to inherit
controls from its subdevice (ADV7180). Finally the driver does not
implement custom file operation but it uses the generic ones from
videobuf2 and v4l2_fh
