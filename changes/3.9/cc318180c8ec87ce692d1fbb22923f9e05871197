[media] tveeprom: Fix lots of bad whitespace

While running checkpatch.pl after the last patch, I noticed
lots of those:
	WARNING: please, no space before tabs
	#151: FILE: drivers/media/common/tveeprom.c:99:
	+^I{ TUNER_ABSENT,        ^I^I"None" },$

(together with other checkpatch.pl errors/warnings)

While I won't be fixing everything, as I have already an
script to fix the above, let's do it, in order to clean it
a little bit.

While here, also drop cmacs-specific format text at the end.
