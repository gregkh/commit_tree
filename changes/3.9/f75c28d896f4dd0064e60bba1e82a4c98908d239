metag: hugetlb: convert to vm_unmapped_area()

Convert hugetlb_get_unmapped_area_new_pmd() to use vm_unmapped_area()
rather than searching the virtual address space itself. This fixes the
following errors in linux-next due to the specified members being
removed after other architectures have already been converted:

arch/metag/mm/hugetlbpage.c: In function 'hugetlb_get_unmapped_area_new_pmd':
arch/metag/mm/hugetlbpage.c:199: error: 'struct mm_struct' has no member named 'cached_hole_size'
arch/metag/mm/hugetlbpage.c:200: error: 'struct mm_struct' has no member named 'free_area_cache'
arch/metag/mm/hugetlbpage.c:215: error: 'struct mm_struct' has no member named 'cached_hole_size'
