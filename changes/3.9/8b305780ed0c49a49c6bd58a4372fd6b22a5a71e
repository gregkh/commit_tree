mac80211: fix virtual monitor interface locking

The virtual monitor interface has a locking issue, it calls
into the channel context code with the iflist mutex held
which isn't allowed since it is usually acquired the other
way around. The mutex is still required for the interface
iteration, but need not be held across the channel calls.
