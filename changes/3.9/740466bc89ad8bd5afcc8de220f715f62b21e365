tracing: Fix free of probe entry by calling call_rcu_sched()

Because function tracing is very invasive, and can even trace
calls to rcu_read_lock(), RCU access in function tracing is done
with preempt_disable_notrace(). This requires a synchronize_sched()
for updates and not a synchronize_rcu().

Function probes (traceon, traceoff, etc) must be freed after
a synchronize_sched() after its entry has been removed from the
hash. But call_rcu() is used. Fix this by using call_rcu_sched().

Also fix the usage to use hlist_del_rcu() instead of hlist_del().
