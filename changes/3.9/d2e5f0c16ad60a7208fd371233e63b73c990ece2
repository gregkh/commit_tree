ACPI / PCI: Rework the setup and cleanup of device wakeup

Currently, the ACPI wakeup capability of PCI devices is set up
in two different places, partially in acpi_pci_bind() where
runtime wakeup is initialized and partially in
platform_pci_wakeup_init(), where system wakeup is initialized.
The cleanup is only done in acpi_pci_unbind() and it only covers
runtime wakeup.

Use the new .setup() and .cleanup() callbacks in struct acpi_bus_type
to consolidate that code and do the setup and the cleanup each in one
place.
