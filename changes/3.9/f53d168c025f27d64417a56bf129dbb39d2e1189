perf/Power: PERF_EVENT_IOC_ENABLE does not reenable event

If we disable a perf event because we exceeded the specified ->event_limit,
power_pmu_stop() sets the PERF_HES_STOPPED flag on the event.

If the application then re-enables the event using PERF_EVENT_IOC_ENABLE
ioctl, we don't ever clear this STOPPED flag. Consequently, the user space
is never notified of the event.

Following message has more background and test case.

Used the following test cases to verify that this patch works on latest PAPI.

	$ papi.git/src/ctests/nonthread PAPI_TOT_CYC@5000000

	$ papi.git/src/ctests/overflow_single_event

Changelog[v2]:
	- [Paul Mackerras] Also clear PERF_HES_UPTODATE flag since we are
	  restarting the event; cleanup comments and patch description.
