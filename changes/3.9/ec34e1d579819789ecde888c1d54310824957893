[media] mt9t112: mt9t111 format set up differs from mt9t112

The original commit, adding the mt9t112 driver said, that mt9t111 and
mt9t112 had identical register layouts. This however doesn't seem to be
the case. At least pixel format selection in the mt9t111 datasheet is
different from the driver implementation. So far only the default YUYV
format has been verified to work with mt9t111. Limit the driver to only
report one supported format with mt9t111 until more formats are
implemented.
