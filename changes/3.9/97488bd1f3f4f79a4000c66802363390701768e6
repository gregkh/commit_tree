ixgbe: Update ixgbe driver to use __netdev_pick_tx in ixgbe_select_queue

This change updates the ixgbe driver to use __netdev_pick_tx instead of
the current logic it is using to select a queue.  The main result of this
change is that ixgbe can now fully support XPS, and in the case of non-FCoE
enabled configs it means we don't need to have our own ndo_select_queue.
