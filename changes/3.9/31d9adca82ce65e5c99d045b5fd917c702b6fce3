ARM: OMAP2+: Fix broken gpmc support

Commit 6797b4fe (ARM: OMAP2+: Prevent potential crash if GPMC probe fails)
added code to ensure that GPMC chip-selects could not be requested until the
device probe was successful. The chip-selects should have been
unreserved at the end of the probe function, but the code to unreserve
them appears to have ended up in the gpmc_calc_timings() function and
hence, this is causing problems requesting chip-selects. Fix this merge
error by unreserving the chip-selects at the end of the probe, but
before we call the gpmc child probe functions (for device-tree) which
request a chip-select.
