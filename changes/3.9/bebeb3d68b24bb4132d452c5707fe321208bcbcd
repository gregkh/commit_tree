mm: introduce mm_populate() for populating new vmas

When creating new mappings using the MAP_POPULATE / MAP_LOCKED flags (or
with MCL_FUTURE in effect), we want to populate the pages within the
newly created vmas.  This may take a while as we may have to read pages
from disk, so ideally we want to do this outside of the write-locked
mmap_sem region.

This change introduces mm_populate(), which is used to defer populating
such mappings until after the mmap_sem write lock has been released.
This is implemented as a generalization of the former do_mlock_pages(),
which accomplished the same task but was using during mlock() /
mlockall().
