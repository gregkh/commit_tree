regulator: Fix memory garbage dev_err printout.

commit dd8004af: 'regulator: core: Log when a device causes a voltage
constraint fail', tried to print out some information about the
check consumer min/max uV fixup, however, it uses a garbage pointer
left over from list_for_each_entry leading to boot messages in the
form:

'[    2.079890] <RANDOM ASCII>: Restricting voltage, 3735899821-4294967295uV'

Because it references regulator->dev, it could potentially read memory from
anywhere causing a panic.

This patch instead uses rdev and the updated min/max uV values.
