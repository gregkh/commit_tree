usb/acpi: binding xhci root hub usb port with ACPI

This patch is to bind xhci root hub usb port with its acpi node.
The port num in the acpi table matches with the sequence in the xhci
extended capabilities table. So call usb_hcd_find_raw_port_number() to
transfer hub port num into raw port number which associates with
the sequence in the xhci extended capabilities table before binding.
