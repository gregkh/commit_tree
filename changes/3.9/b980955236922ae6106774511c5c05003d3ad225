random: fix locking dependency with the tasklist_lock

Commit 6133705494bb introduced a circular lock dependency because
posix_cpu_timers_exit() is called by release_task(), which is holding
a writer lock on tasklist_lock, and this can cause a deadlock since
kill_fasync() gets called with nonblocking_pool.lock taken.

There's no reason why kill_fasync() needs to be taken while the random
pool is locked, so move it out to fix this locking dependency.
