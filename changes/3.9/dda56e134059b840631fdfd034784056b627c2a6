x86, mm: Fixup code testing if a pfn is direct mapped

Update code that previously assumed pfns [ 0 - max_low_pfn_mapped ) and
[ 4GB - max_pfn_mapped ) were always direct mapped, to now look up
pfn_mapped ranges instead.

-v2: change applying sequence to keep git bisecting working.
     so add dummy pfn_range_is_mapped(). - Yinghai Lu
