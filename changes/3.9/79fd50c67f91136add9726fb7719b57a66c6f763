KVM: s390: Fix handling of iscs.

There are two ways to express an interruption subclass:
- As a bitmask, as used in cr6.
- As a number, as used in the I/O interruption word.

Unfortunately, we have treated the I/O interruption word as if it
contained the bitmask as well, which went unnoticed so far as
- (not-yet-released) qemu made the same mistake, and
- Linux guest kernels don't check the isc value in the I/O interruption
  word for subchannel interrupts.

Make sure that we treat the I/O interruption word correctly.
