staging: zcache: rename ramster to zcache

[V2: no code changes, patchset now generated via git format-patch -M]

In staging, rename ramster to zcache

The original zcache in staging was a "demo" version, and this new zcache
is a significant rewrite.  While certain disagreements were being resolved,
both "old zcache" and "new zcache" needed to reside in the staging tree
simultaneously.  In order to minimize code change and churn, the newer
version of zcache was temporarily merged into the "ramster" staging driver
which, prior to that, had at one time heavily leveraged the older version
of zcache.  So, recently, "new zcache" resided in the ramster directory.

Got that? No? Sorry, temporary political compromises are rarely pretty.

The older version of zcache is no longer being maintained and has now
been removed from the staging tree.  So now the newer version of zcache
can rightfully reclaim sole possession of the name "zcache".

FYI, this [PATCH 2/5] is simply a "git mv" generated by "git format-patch -M".
