xen-blkback: fix dispatch_rw_block_io() error path

Commit 7708992 ("xen/blkback: Seperate the bio allocation and the bio
submission") consolidated the pendcnt updates to just a single write,
neglecting the fact that the error path relied on it getting set to 1
up front (such that the decrement in __end_block_io_op() would actually
drop the count to zero, triggering the necessary cleanup actions).

Also remove a misleading and a stale (after said commit) comment.
