memcg: move memcg_stock initialization to mem_cgroup_init

memcg_stock are currently initialized during the root cgroup allocation
which is OK but it pointlessly pollutes memcg allocation code with
something that can be called when the memcg subsystem is initialized by
mem_cgroup_init along with other controller specific parts.

This patch wraps the current memcg_stock initialization code into a
helper calls it from the controller subsystem initialization code.
