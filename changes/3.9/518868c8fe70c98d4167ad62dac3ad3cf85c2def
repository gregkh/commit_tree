usb: gadget: fix omap_udc build errors

1bf0cf6040 "usb: gadget: omap_udc: convert to udc_start/udc_stop"
made some trivial changes but was missing a ';' character.

8c4cc00552 "ARM: OMAP1: DMA: Moving OMAP1 DMA channel definitions
to mach-omap1" added a definition for OMAP_DMA_USB_W2FC_TX0 to
the driver while making the header file it was defined in
unavailable for drivers, but this driver actually needs
OMAP_DMA_USB_W2FC_RX0 as well.

Both changes appear trivial, so let's add the missing semicolon
and the macro definition.
