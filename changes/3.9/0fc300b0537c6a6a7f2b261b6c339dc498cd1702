ACPI: Make acpi_bus_add() and acpi_bus_start() visibly different

The current ACPI namespace scanning code suggests that acpi_bus_add()
and acpi_bus_start() share some code.  In fact, however, they are
completely different code paths (except for the initial checks), so
refactor the code to make that distinction visibly clear.
