perf: Generate EXIT event only once per task context

perf_event_task_event() iterates pmu list and generate events
for each eligible pmu context.  But if task_event has task_ctx
like in EXIT it'll generate events even though the pmu doesn't
have an eligible one. Fix it by moving the code to proper
places.

Before this patch:

  $ perf record -n true
  [ perf record: Woken up 1 times to write data ]
  [ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.006 MB perf.data (~248 samples) ]

  $ perf report -D | tail
  Aggregated stats:
             TOTAL events:         73
              MMAP events:         67
              COMM events:          2
              EXIT events:          4
  cycles stats:
             TOTAL events:         73
              MMAP events:         67
              COMM events:          2
              EXIT events:          4

After this patch:

  $ perf report -D | tail
  Aggregated stats:
             TOTAL events:         70
              MMAP events:         67
              COMM events:          2
              EXIT events:          1
  cycles stats:
             TOTAL events:         70
              MMAP events:         67
              COMM events:          2
              EXIT events:          1
