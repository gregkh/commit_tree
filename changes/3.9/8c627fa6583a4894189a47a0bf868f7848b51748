ARM: tegra: clean up the CPUINIT section

There are some redundant codes in the CPUINIT section that was caused by
some codes not be organized well in "headsmp.S". Currently all the codes
in "headsmp.S" were put into CPUINIT section. But actually it doesn't
need to be loacted in CPUINIT section. There is no fuction access them
in CPUINIT section and we will relocate them to IRAM.

These codes also caused some unnecessary functions that access these
codes been put into CPUINIT section too. This patch clean it up and put
them into normal text section.
