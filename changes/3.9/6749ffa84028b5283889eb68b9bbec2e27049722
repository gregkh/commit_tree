staging: comedi: ni_labpc_cs: move comedi_driver declaration

Move the comedi_driver declaration down in the file. This removes
the need for the forward declaration.

For aesthetic reasons, add some whitespace to the declaration and
remove the unnecessary '&' before the function names. They are
already addresses.
