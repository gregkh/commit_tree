sparc, mm: Remove calling of free_all_bootmem_node()

Now NO_BOOTMEM version free_all_bootmem_node() does not really
do free_bootmem at all, and it only call
register_page_bootmem_info_node instead.

That is confusing, try to kill that free_all_bootmem_node().

Before that, this patch will remove calling of free_all_bootmem_node()

We add register_page_bootmem_info() to call register_page_bootmem_info_node
directly.

Also could use free_all_bootmem() for numa case, and it is just
the same as free_low_memory_core_early().
