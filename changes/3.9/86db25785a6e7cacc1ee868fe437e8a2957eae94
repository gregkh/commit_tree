Btrfs: fix max chunk size on raid5/6

We try to limit the size of a chunk to 10GB, which keeps the unit of
work reasonable during balance and resize operations.  The limit checks
were taking into account the number of copies of the data we had but
what they really should be doing is comparing against the logical
size of the chunk we're creating.

This moves the code around a little to use the count of data stripes
from raid5/6.
