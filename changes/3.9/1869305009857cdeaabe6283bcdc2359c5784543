mm: introduce VM_POPULATE flag to better deal with racy userspace programs

The vm_populate() code populates user mappings without constantly
holding the mmap_sem.  This makes it susceptible to racy userspace
programs: the user mappings may change while vm_populate() is running,
and in this case vm_populate() may end up populating the new mapping
instead of the old one.

In order to reduce the possibility of userspace getting surprised by
this behavior, this change introduces the VM_POPULATE vma flag which
gets set on vmas we want vm_populate() to work on.  This way
vm_populate() may still end up populating the new mapping after such a
race, but only if the new mapping is also one that the user has
requested (using MAP_SHARED, MAP_LOCKED or mlock) to be populated.
