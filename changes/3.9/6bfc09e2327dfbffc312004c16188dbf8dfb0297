rcu: Provide RCU CPU stall warnings for tiny RCU

Tiny RCU has historically omitted RCU CPU stall warnings in order to
reduce memory requirements, however, lack of these warnings caused
Thomas Gleixner some debugging pain recently.  Therefore, this commit
adds RCU CPU stall warnings to tiny RCU if RCU_TRACE=y.  This keeps
the memory footprint small, while still enabling CPU stall warnings
in kernels built to enable them.

Updated to include Josh Triplett's suggested use of RCU_STALL_COMMON
config variable to simplify #if expressions.
