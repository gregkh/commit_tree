regulatory: remove handling of channel bandwidth

The channel bandwidth handling isn't really quite right,
it assumes that a 40 MHz channel is really two 20 MHz
channels, which isn't strictly true. This is the way the
regulatory database handling is defined right now though
so remove the logic to handle other channel widths.
