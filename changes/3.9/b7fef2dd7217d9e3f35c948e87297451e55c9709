s390/uaccess: fix clear_user_pt()

The page table walker variant of clear_user() is supposed to copy the
contents of the empty zero page to user space.
However since 238ec4ef "[S390] zero page cache synonyms" empty_zero_page
is not anymore the page itself but contains the pointer to the empty zero
pages. Therefore the page table walker variant of clear_user() copied
the address of the first empty zero page and afterwards more or less
random data to user space instead of clearing the given user space range.
