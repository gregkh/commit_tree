ALSA: hda/ca0132 - Check download state of DSP.

Instead of using the dspload_is_loaded() function, check the dsp_state
that is kept in the spec.  The dspload_is_loaded() function returns
true if the DSP transfer was never started.  This false-positive leads
to multiple second delays when ca0132_setup_efaults() times out on
each write.
