ARM: OMAP2+: fix some omap_device_build() calls that aren't compiled by default

Commit c1d1cd597fc77af3086470f8627d77f52f7f8b6c ("ARM: OMAP2+:
omap_device: remove obsolete pm_lats and early_device code") missed a
few omap_device_build() calls that aren't included as part of the default
OMAP2+ Kconfig, omap2plus_defconfig.

Ideally, all devices that are present on the SoC should be created by
default, and only the corresponding device driver should be configured
or deconfigured in Kconfig.  This allows drivers to be built as
modules and loaded later, even if they weren't part of the original
kernel build.  Unfortunately, we're not quite there yet.

Thanks to Tony Lindgren for reporting this, found during his
randconfig tests.
