mwifiex: use pci_alloc/free_consistent APIs for PCIe

This patch uses pci_alloc_consistent and pci_free_consistent
APIs for mwifiex_pcie driver. Consistent DMA memory is allocated
for TX, RX and event rings. Command buffer and command response
buffer also uses map/unmap memory APIs to download commands and
get command responses.
