efi: Pass boot services variable info to runtime code

EFI variables can be flagged as being accessible only within boot services.
This makes it awkward for us to figure out how much space they use at
runtime. In theory we could figure this out by simply comparing the results
from QueryVariableInfo() to the space used by all of our variables, but
that fails if the platform doesn't garbage collect on every boot. Thankfully,
calling QueryVariableInfo() while still inside boot services gives a more
reliable answer. This patch passes that information from the EFI boot stub
up to the efi platform code.
