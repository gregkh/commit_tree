drm: create drm_framebuffer_lookup

And replace all fb lookups with it. Also add a WARN to
drm_mode_object_find since that is now no longer the blessed interface
to look up an fb. And add kerneldoc to both functions.

This only updates all callsites, but immediately drops the acquired
refence again. Hence all callers still rely on the fact that a mode fb
can't disappear while they're holding the struct mutex. Subsequent
patches will instate proper use of refcounts, and then rework the rmfb
and unref code to no longer serialize fb destruction with the
mode_config lock. We don't want that since otherwise a compositor
might end up stalling for a few frames in rmfb.

v2: Don't use kref_get_unless_zero - Greg KH doesn't like that kind of
interface.
