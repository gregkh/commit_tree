ACPICA: Update compilation environment settings.

This patch does not affect the generation of the Linux binary.
This patch decreases 300 lines of 20121018 divergence.diff.

This patch updates architecture specific environment settings for compiling
ACPICA as such enhancement already has been done in ACPICA.

Note that the appended compiler default settings in the
<acpi/platform/acenv.h> will deprecate some of the macros defined in the
architecture specific <asm/acpi.h>. Thus two of the <asm/acpi.h> headers
have been cleaned up in this patch accordingly.
