Revert "PCI/ACPI: Request _OSC control before scanning PCI root bus"

This reverts commit 8c33f51df406e1a1f7fa4e9b244845b7ebd61fa6.

Conflicts:

This commit broke some pre-1.1 PCIe devices by leaving them with
ASPM enabled.  Previously, we had disabled ASPM on these devices
because many of them don't implement it correctly (per 149e1637).

Requesting _OSC control early means that aspm_disabled may be set
before we scan the PCI bus and configure link ASPM state.  But the
ASPM configuration currently skips the check for pre-PCIe 1.1 devices
when aspm_disabled is set, like this:

    acpi_pci_root_add
      acpi_pci_osc_support
        if (flags != base_flags)
          pcie_no_aspm
            aspm_disabled = 1
      pci_acpi_scan_root
        ...
          pcie_aspm_init_link_state
            pcie_aspm_sanity_check
              if (!aspm_disabled)
                /* check for pre-PCIe 1.1 device */

Therefore, setting aspm_disabled early means that we leave ASPM enabled
on these pre-PCIe 1.1 devices, which is a regression for some devices.

The best fix would be to clean up the ASPM init so we can evaluate
_OSC before scanning the bug (that way boot-time and hot-add discovery
will work the same), but that requires significant rework.

For now, we'll just revert the _OSC change as the lowest-risk fix.
