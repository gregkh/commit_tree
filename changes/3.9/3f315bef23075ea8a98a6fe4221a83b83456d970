netconsole: don't call __netpoll_cleanup() while atomic

__netpoll_cleanup() is called in netconsole_netdev_event() while holding a
spinlock. Release/acquire the spinlock before/after it and restart the
loop. Also, disable the netconsole completely, because we won't have chance
after the restart of the loop, and might end up in a situation where
nt->enabled == 1 and nt->np.dev == NULL.
