bridge: Add vlan filtering infrastructure

Adds an optional infrustructure component to bridge that would allow
native vlan filtering in the bridge.  Each bridge port (as well
as the bridge device) now get a VLAN bitmap.  Each bit in the bitmap
is associated with a vlan id.  This way if the bit corresponding to
the vid is set in the bitmap that the packet with vid is allowed to
enter and exit the port.

Write access the bitmap is protected by RTNL and read access
protected by RCU.

Vlan functionality is disabled by default.
