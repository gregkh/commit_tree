drm: refcounting for crtc framebuffers

With the prep patch to encapsulate ->set_crtc calls, this is now
rather easy. Hooray for inconsistent semantics between ->set_crtc and
->page_flip, where the driver callback is supposed to update the fb
pointer, and ->update_plane, where the drm core does the same.

Also, since the drm core functions check crtc->fb before calling into
driver callbacks, we can't really reduce the critical sections
protected by the mode_config locks.
