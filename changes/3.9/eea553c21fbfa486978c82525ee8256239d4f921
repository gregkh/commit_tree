ceph: Only allow mounts in the initial network namespace

Today ceph opens tcp sockets from a delayed work callback.  Delayed
work happens from kernel threads which are always in the initial
network namespace.   Therefore fail early if someone attempts
to mount a ceph filesystem from something other than the initial
network namespace.
