libfc: fix REC handling

Currently fc_fcp_timeout doesn't check FC_RP_FLAGS_REC_SUPPORTED
flag first, this prevents REC request ever going out at all
to the target having REC support. So this patches fixes the
fc_fcp_timeout by checking FC_RP_FLAGS_REC_SUPPORTED flag first.

The changed order won't cause any issue during clearing
FC_RP_FLAGS_REC_SUPPORTED on failed IO with target not supporting
FC_RP_FLAGS_REC_SUPPORTED, since retry on failed IO would succeed.
