ALSA: hda - Fix PCM name string for generic parser

When a PCM name string is generated from the chip name, it might
become strange like "CX20549 (Venice) Analog".  In this patch, the
parser tries to drop the invalid words like "(Venice)" in the PCM name
string.  Also, when the name string is given beforehand by the caller,
respect it and use it as is.
