pkt_sched: sch_qfq: do not allow virtual time to jump if an aggregate is in service

By definition of (the algorithm of) QFQ+, the system virtual time must
be pushed up only if there is no 'eligible' aggregate, i.e. no
aggregate that would have started to be served also in the ideal
system emulated by QFQ+.  QFQ+ serves only eligible aggregates, hence
the aggregate currently in service is eligible.  As a consequence, to
decide whether there is no eligible aggregate, QFQ+ must also check
whether there is no aggregate in service.
