leds-lp55xx: fix problem on removing LED attributes

 LP55XX common device attributes, 'led_current' and 'max_current' are created
 while loading the driver.
 Those are LED device attributes which are removed automatically on releasing
 led class devices - led_classdev_unregister().
 Therefore, this duplicate code should be removed.
