make CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL invisible and default

This config item has not carried much meaning for a while now and is
almost always enabled by default (especially in distro builds). As agreed
during the Linux kernel summit, it should be removed. As a first step,
remove it from being listed, and default it to on. Once it has been
removed from all subsystem Kconfigs, it will be dropped entirely.

For items that really are experimental, maintainers should use "default
n", optionally include "(EXPERIMENTAL)" in the title, and add language to
the help text indicating why the item should be considered experimental.

For items that are dangerously experimental, the maintainer is encouraged
to follow the above title recommendation, add stronger language to the
help text, and optionally use (depending on the extent of the danger,
from least to most dangerous): printk(), add_taint(TAINT_WARN),
add_taint(TAINT_CRAP), WARN_ON(1), and CONFIG_BROKEN.
