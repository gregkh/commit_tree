net: cacheline adjust struct inet_frag_queue

Fragmentation code cacheline adjusting of struct inet_frag_queue.

Take advantage of the size of struct timer_list, and move all but
spinlock_t lock, below the timer struct.  On 64-bit 'lru_list',
'list' and 'refcnt', fits exactly into the next cacheline, and a
new cacheline starts at 'fragments'.

The netns_frags *net pointer is moved to the end of the struct,
because its used in a compare, with "next/close-by" elements of
which this struct is embedded into.
