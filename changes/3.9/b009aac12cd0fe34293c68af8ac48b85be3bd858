bnx2x: fix occasional statistics off-by-4GB error

The UPDATE_QSTAT function introduced on February 15, 2012
in commit 1355b704b9ba "bnx2x: consistent statistics after
internal driver reload" incorrectly fails to handle overflow
during addition of the lower 32-bit field of a stat.

This bug is present since 3.4-rc1 and should thus be considered
a candidate for stable 3.4+ releases.
