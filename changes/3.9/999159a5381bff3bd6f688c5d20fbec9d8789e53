ARC: [DeviceTree] Basic support

This is minimal infrastructure needed for devicetree work.
It uses an a sample "skeleton" devicetree - embedded in kernel image -
to print the board, manufacturer by parsing the top-level "compatible"
string.

As of now we don't need any additional "board" specific "machine_desc".

TODO: support interpreting the command line as boot-loader passed dtb
