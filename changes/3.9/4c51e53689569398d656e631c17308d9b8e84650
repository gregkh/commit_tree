smsc75xx: fix jumbo frame support

This patch enables RX of jumbo frames for LAN7500.

Previously the driver would transmit jumbo frames succesfully but
would drop received jumbo frames (incrementing the interface errors
count).

With this patch applied the device can succesfully receive jumbo
frames up to MTU 9000 (9014 bytes on the wire including ethernet
header).
