[media] staging: go7007: fix test for V4L2_STD_SECAM

The current test doesn't make a lot of sense.  It's likely to be true,
which is what we would want in most cases.  From looking at how this is
handled in other drivers,  I think "&" was intended instead of "*".
It's an easy mistake to make because they are next to each other on the
keyboard.
