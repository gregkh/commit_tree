net/mlx4_en: Fix a race when closing TX queue

There is a possible race where the TX completion handler can clean the
entire TX queue between the decision that the queue is full and actually
closing it. To avoid this situation, check again if the queue is really
full, if not, reopen the transmit and continue with sending the packet.
