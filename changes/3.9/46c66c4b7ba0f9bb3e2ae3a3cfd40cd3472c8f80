memory-hotplug: remove /sys/firmware/memmap/X sysfs

When (hot)adding memory into system, /sys/firmware/memmap/X/{end, start,
type} sysfs files are created.  But there is no code to remove these
files.  This patch implements the function to remove them.

We cannot free firmware_map_entry which is allocated by bootmem because
there is no way to do so when the system is up.  But we can at least
remember the address of that memory and reuse the storage when the
memory is added next time.

This patch also introduces a new list map_entries_bootmem to link the
map entries allocated by bootmem when they are removed, and a lock to
protect it.  And these entries will be reused when the memory is
hot-added again.

The idea is suggestted by Andrew Morton.

NOTE: It is unsafe to return an entry pointer and release the
      map_entries_lock.  So we should not hold the map_entries_lock
      separately in firmware_map_find_entry() and
      firmware_map_remove_entry().  Hold the map_entries_lock across find
      and remove /sys/firmware/memmap/X operation.

       And also, users of these two functions need to be careful to
      hold the lock when using these two functions.
