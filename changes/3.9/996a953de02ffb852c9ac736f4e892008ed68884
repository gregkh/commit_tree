can: add tx/rx LED trigger support

This patch implements the functions to add two LED triggers, named
<ifname>-tx and <ifname>-rx, to a canbus device driver.

Triggers are called from specific handlers by each CAN device driver and
can be disabled altogether with a Kconfig option.

The implementation keeps the LED on when the interface is UP and blinks
the LED on network activity at a configurable rate.

This only supports can-dev based drivers, as it uses some support field
in the can_priv structure.

Supported drivers should call devm_can_led_init() and can_led_event() as
needed.

Cleanup is handled automatically by devres, so no *_exit function is
needed.

Supported events are:
- CAN_LED_EVENT_OPEN: turn on tx/rx LEDs
- CAN_LED_EVENT_STOP: turn off tx/rx LEDs
- CAN_LED_EVENT_TX: trigger tx LED blink
- CAN_LED_EVENT_RX: trigger tx LED blink
