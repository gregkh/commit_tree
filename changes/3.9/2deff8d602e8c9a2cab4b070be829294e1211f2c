spi: Remove erroneous __init, __exit and __exit_p() references in drivers

Some of the spi driver module remove hooks were annotated with __exit
and referenced with __exit_p(). Presumably these were supposed to be
__devinit, __devexit and __devexit_p() since __init/__exit for a
probe/remove hook has never been correct. They also got missed during
the big __devinit/__devexit purge since they didn't match the pattern.
Remove then now to be rid of it.

v2: purge __init also
