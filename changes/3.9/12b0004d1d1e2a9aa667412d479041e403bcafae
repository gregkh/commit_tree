net: adjust skb_gso_segment() for calling in rx path

skb_gso_segment() is almost always called in tx path,
except for openvswitch. It calls this function when
it receives the packet and tries to queue it to user-space.
In this special case, the ->ip_summed check inside
skb_gso_segment() is no longer true, as ->ip_summed value
has different meanings on rx path.

This patch adjusts skb_gso_segment() so that we can at least
avoid such warnings on checksum.
