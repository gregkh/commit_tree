xtensa: add support for TLS

The Xtensa architecture provides a global register called THREADPTR
for the purpose of Thread Local Storage (TLS) support. This allows us
to use a fairly simple implementation, keeping the thread pointer in
the regset and simply saving and restoring it upon entering/exiting
the from user space.
