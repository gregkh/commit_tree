mm: accelerate mm_populate() treatment of THP pages

This change adds a follow_page_mask function which is equivalent to
follow_page, but with an extra page_mask argument.

follow_page_mask sets *page_mask to HPAGE_PMD_NR - 1 when it encounters
a THP page, and to 0 in other cases.

__get_user_pages() makes use of this in order to accelerate populating
THP ranges - that is, when both the pages and vmas arrays are NULL, we
don't need to iterate HPAGE_PMD_NR times to cover a single THP page (and
we also avoid taking mm->page_table_lock that many times).
