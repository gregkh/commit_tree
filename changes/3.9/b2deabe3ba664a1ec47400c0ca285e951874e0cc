arm: arch_timer: add arch_counter_set_user_access

Several bits in CNTKCTL reset to 0, including PL0VTEN. For architectures
using the generic timer which wish to have a fast gettimeofday vDSO
implementation, these bits must be set to 1 by the kernel. For
architectures without a vDSO, it's best to leave the bits set to 0 for
now to ensure that if and when support is added, it's implemented sanely
architecture wide.

As the bootloader might set PL0VTEN to a value that doesn't correspond
to that which the kernel prefers, we must explicitly set it to the
architecture port's preferred value.

This patch adds arch_counter_set_user_access, which sets the PL0 access
permissions to that required by the architecture. For arch/arm, this
currently means disabling all userspace access.
