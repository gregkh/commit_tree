rbd: make exists flag atomic

The rbd_device->exists field can be updated asynchronously, changing
from set to clear if a mapped snapshot disappears from the base
image's snapshot context.

Currently, value of the "exists" flag is only read and modified
under protection of the header semaphore, but that will change with
the next patch.  Making it atomic ensures this won't be a problem
because the a the non-existence of device will be immediately known.
