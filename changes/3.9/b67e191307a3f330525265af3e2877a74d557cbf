e1000e: add support for hardware timestamping on some devices

On 82574, 82583, 82579, I217 and I218 add support for hardware time
stamping of all or no Rx packets and Tx packets which have the
SKBTX_HW_TSTAMP flag set.  Update the .get_ts_info ethtool operation to
report the supported time stamping modes, and enable and disable hardware
time stamping with the SIOCSHWTSTAMP ioctl.
