arm: Use generic timer broadcast receiver

Currently, the ARM backend must maintain a redundant list of timers for
the purpose of centralising timer broadcast functionality. This prevents
sharing timer drivers across architectures.

This patch moves the pain of dealing with timer broadcasts to the core
clockevents tick broadcast code, which already maintains its own list
of timers.
