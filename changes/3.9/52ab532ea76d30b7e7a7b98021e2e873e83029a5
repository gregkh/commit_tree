parisc: fix ptrace breakage

1) PTRACE_SYSCALL doesn't work for 64bit process on parisc64.
Compat syscall table is used instead of 64bit one.  IMO we should either
refuse to allow PTRACE_SYSCALL for 64bit processes or duplicate the
logics choosing the right syscall table into .Ltracesys.

	2) if you have let the tracee run with PTRACE_SYSCALL and
it had stopped, you can use PTRACE_POKEUSR to modify syscall number
(r20) and arguments 1--4 (r26--r23).  Modifications will have effect.
However, modifying arguments 5 and 6 (r22 and r21 resp.) works only
when process (32bit one) runs on 64bit host - on 32bit one it has no
effect.  AFAICS, the diff below should fix that one.
