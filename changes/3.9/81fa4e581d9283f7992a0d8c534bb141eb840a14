efivars: Disable external interrupt while holding efivars->lock

[Problem]
There is a scenario which efi_pstore fails to log messages in a panic case.

 - CPUA holds an efi_var->lock in either efivarfs parts
   or efi_pstore with interrupt enabled.
 - CPUB panics and sends IPI to CPUA in smp_send_stop().
 - CPUA stops with holding the lock.
 - CPUB kicks efi_pstore_write() via kmsg_dump(KSMG_DUMP_PANIC)
   but it returns without logging messages.

[Patch Description]
This patch disables an external interruption while holding efivars->lock
as follows.

In efi_pstore_write() and get_var_data(), spin_lock/spin_unlock is
replaced by spin_lock_irqsave/spin_unlock_irqrestore because they may
be called in an interrupt context.

In other functions, they are replaced by spin_lock_irq/spin_unlock_irq.
because they are all called from a process context.

By applying this patch, we can avoid the problem above with
a following senario.

 - CPUA holds an efi_var->lock with interrupt disabled.
 - CPUB panics and sends IPI to CPUA in smp_send_stop().
 - CPUA receives the IPI after releasing the lock because it is
   disabling interrupt while holding the lock.
 - CPUB waits for one sec until CPUA releases the lock.
 - CPUB kicks efi_pstore_write() via kmsg_dump(KSMG_DUMP_PANIC)
   And it can hold the lock successfully.
