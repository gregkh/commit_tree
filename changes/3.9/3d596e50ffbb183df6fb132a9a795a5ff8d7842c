staging: comedi: addi_apci_3501: board has a timer

The board supported by this driver has a timer device. Remove the
conditional and always init the subdevice.

Also, move the subdevice insn_* function pointers out of the
boardinfo and use them to initialize the subdevice directly.

Since devpriv->s_EeParameters.i_Timer is not longer being used,
remove its initialization also.
