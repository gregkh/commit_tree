ALSA: usb-audio: add a workaround for the NuForce UDH-100

The NuForce UDH-100 numbers its interfaces incorrectly, which makes the
interface associations come out wrong, which results in the driver
erroring out with the message "Audio class v2 interfaces need an
interface association".

Work around this by searching for the interface association descriptor
also in some other place where it might have ended up.
