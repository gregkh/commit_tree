usb: enable usb port device's async suspend.

This patch is to set power.async_suspend for usb port in order
to allow it to be suspended and resumed asynchronously during
system sleep transitions.

The power.async_suspend flag is also set for devices that don't have
suspend or resume callbacks, because otherwise they would make the
main suspend/resume thread wait for their "asynchronous" children
(during suspend) or parents (during resume), effectively negating the
possible gains from executing these devices' suspend and resume
callbacks asynchronously.
