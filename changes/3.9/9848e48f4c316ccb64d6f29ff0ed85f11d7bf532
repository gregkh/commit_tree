ARM: dma-mapping: add support for CMA regions placed in highmem zone

This patch adds missing pieces to correctly support memory pages served
from CMA regions placed in high memory zones. Please note that the default
global CMA area is still put into lowmem and is limited by optional
architecture specific DMA zone. One can however put device specific CMA
regions in high memory zone to reduce lowmem usage.
