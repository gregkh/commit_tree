x86, boot: Move lldt/ltr out of 64bit code section

commit 08da5a2ca

    x86_64: Early segment setup for VT

sets up LDT and TR into a valid state in order to speed up boot
decompression under VT.

Those code are put in code64, and it is using GDT that is only
loaded from code32 path.

That breaks booting with 64bit bootloader that does not go through
code32 path and jump to startup_64 directly, and it has different
GDT.

Move those lines into code32 after their GDT is loaded.
