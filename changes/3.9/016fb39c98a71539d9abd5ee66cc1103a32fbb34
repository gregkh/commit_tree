ASoC: palm27x: fix widgets and routes in dai_link init

ASoC core code now handles creation of controls and routing based on contents of
struct snd_soc_card, so remove calls to snd_soc_dapm_new_controls() and
snd_soc_dapm_add_routes() from the snd_soc_dai_link init function, and add
widget and route definitions to struct snd_soc_card.
