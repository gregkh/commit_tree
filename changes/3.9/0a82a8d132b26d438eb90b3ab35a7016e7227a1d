Revert "block: add missing block_bio_complete() tracepoint"

This reverts commit 3a366e614d0837d9fc23f78cdb1a1186ebc3387f.

Wanlong Gao reports that it causes a kernel panic on his machine several
minutes after boot. Reverting it removes the panic.

Jens says:
 "It's not quite clear why that is yet, so I think we should just revert
  the commit for 3.9 final (which I'm assuming is pretty close).

  The wifi is crap at the LSF hotel, so sending this email instead of
  queueing up a revert and pull request."
