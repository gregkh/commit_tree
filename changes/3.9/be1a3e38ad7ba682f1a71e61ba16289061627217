staging: alarm-dev: Drop pre Android 1.0 _OLD ioctls

Per Colin's comment:
"The "support old userspace code" comment for those two ioctls has
been there since pre-Android 1.0.  Those apis are not exposed to
Android apps, I don't see any problem deleting them."

Thus this patch removes the ANDROID_ALARM_SET_OLD and
ANDROID_ALARM_SET_AND_WAIT_OLD ioctl compatability
logic.
