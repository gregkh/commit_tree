netlabel: correctly list all the static label mappings

When we have a large number of static label mappings that spill across
the netlink message boundary we fail to properly save our state in the
netlink_callback struct which causes us to repeat the same listings.
This patch fixes this problem by saving the state correctly between
calls to the NetLabel static label netlink "dumpit" routines.
