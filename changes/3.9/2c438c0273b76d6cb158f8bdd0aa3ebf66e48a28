drm/i915: use gmbus irq to wait for gmbus idle

GMBUS_ACTIVE has inverted sense and so doesn't fit into the
wait_hw_status helper, hence create a new gmbus_wait_idle functions.
Also, we only care about the idle irq event and nothing else, which
allows us to use the wait_event_timeout helper directly without
jumping through hoops to catch NAKs.

Since gen2/3 don't have gmbus interrupts, handle them separately with
the old wait_for macro.

This shaves another few ms off reading EDID from a hdmi screen on my
testbox here. EDID reading with interrupt driven gmbus is now as fast
as with busy-looping gmbus at 28 ms here (with negligible cpu
overhead).
