KVM: x86: improve reexecute_instruction

The current reexecute_instruction can not well detect the failed instruction
emulation. It allows guest to retry all the instructions except it accesses
on error pfn

For example, some cases are nested-write-protect - if the page we want to
write is used as PDE but it chains to itself. Under this case, we should
stop the emulation and report the case to userspace
