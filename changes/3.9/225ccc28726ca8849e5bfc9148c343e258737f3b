drivers/rtc/rtc-tps65910.c: set irq flag to IRQF_EARLY_RESUME during irq request

All interrupt get disabled during system suspend and enabled during system
resume.  The enabling/disabling of interrupt happen in sequence of
interrupt registration with framework.

Therefore, in resume, the parent interrupt of this device enabled before
the RTC irq interrupt enabled.  If RTC is enabled for alarm wake and if
system wake by alarm then there is interrupt pending for RTC.  In resume,
the parent interrupt get enabled before the rtc interrupt and hence ISR
get served.  In ISR, it founds that rtc interrupt is disabled and so it
does not call the rtc isr handler and hence it misses the interrupt.

Setting flag for early resume so that rtc interrupt get enabled before
parent interrupt and so rtc interrupt get enabled when parent interrupt
handler check for interrupt of device and call the rtc handler if it is
there.  This way it will not miss the interrupt.
