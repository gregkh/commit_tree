x86, mm: Patch out arch_flush_lazy_mmu_mode() when running on bare metal

Invoking arch_flush_lazy_mmu_mode() results in calls to
preempt_enable()/disable() which may have performance impact.

Since lazy MMU is not used on bare metal we can patch away
arch_flush_lazy_mmu_mode() so that it is never called in such
environment.

[ hpa: the previous patch "Fix vmalloc_fault oops during lazy MMU
  updates" may cause a minor performance regression on
  bare metal.  This patch resolves that performance regression.  It is
  somewhat unclear to me if this is a good -stable candidate. ]
