tipc: eliminate duplicated discard_rx_queue routine

The tipc function discard_rx_queue() is just a duplicated
implementation of __skb_queue_purge().  Remove the former
and directly invoke __skb_queue_purge().

In doing so, the underscores convey to the code reader, more
information about the current locking state that is assumed.
