TTY: switch tty_buffer_request_room to tty_port

Now, we start converting tty buffer functions to actually use
tty_port. This will allow us to get rid of the need of tty pointer in
many call sites. Only tty_port will be needed and hence no more
tty_port_tty_get calls in those paths.

Here we start with tty_buffer_request_room.
