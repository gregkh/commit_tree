mm: vmscan: clean up get_scan_count()

Reclaim pressure balance between anon and file pages is calculated
through a tuple of numerators and a shared denominator.

Exceptional cases that want to force-scan anon or file pages configure
the numerators and denominator such that one list is preferred, which is
not necessarily the most obvious way:

    fraction[0] = 1;
    fraction[1] = 0;
    denominator = 1;
    goto out;

Make this easier by making the force-scan cases explicit and use the
fractionals only in case they are calculated from reclaim history.
