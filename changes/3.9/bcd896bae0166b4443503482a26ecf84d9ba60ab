sparc64: Handle hugepage TSB being NULL.

Accomodate the possibility that the TSB might be NULL at
the point that update_mmu_cache() is invoked.  This is
necessary because we will sometimes need to defer the TSB
allocation to the first fault that happens in the 'mm'.

Seperate out the hugepage PTE test into a seperate function
so that the logic is clearer.
