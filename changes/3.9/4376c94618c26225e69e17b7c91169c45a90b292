pnfs-block: removing DM device maybe cause oops when call dev_remove

when pnfs block using device mapper,if umounting later,it maybe
cause oops. we apply "1 + sizeof(bl_umount_request)" memory for
msg->data, the memory maybe overflow when we do "memcpy(&dataptr
[sizeof(bl_msg)], &bl_umount_request, sizeof(bl_umount_request))",
because the size of bl_msg is more than 1 byte.
