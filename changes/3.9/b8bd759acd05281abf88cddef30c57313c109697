ACPI / scan: Drop acpi_bus_add() and use acpi_bus_scan() instead

The only difference between acpi_bus_scan() and acpi_bus_add() is the
invocation of acpi_update_all_gpes() in the latter which in fact is
unnecessary, because acpi_update_all_gpes() has already been called
by acpi_scan_init() and the way it is implemented guarantees the next
invocations of it to do nothing.

For this reason, drop acpi_bus_add() and make all its callers use
acpi_bus_scan() directly instead of it.  Additionally, rearrange the
code in acpi_scan_init() slightly to improve the visibility of the
acpi_update_all_gpes() call in there.
