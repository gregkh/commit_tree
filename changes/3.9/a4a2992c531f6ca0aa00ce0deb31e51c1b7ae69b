ASoC: simple-card: add asoc_simple_dai for initializing

Current simple-card driver calls asoc_simple_card_dai_init()
if platform had a asoc_simple_card_dai_init pointer.
And, this initialization function works only
when platform has an applicable initial value for each dai settings.
And basically, almost all sound card requires certain initialization.
This means that almost all platform has initialization settings,
and driver do nothing if it doesn't have settings.

And additionally, current simple-card supports sysclk settings but it was
only for codec.  In order to abolish deviation between cpu and codec,
and in order to simplify processing,
this patch adds asoc_simple_dai, and removed pointless
struct asoc_simple_dai_init_info which was trigger of
calling asoc_simple_card_dai_init().
