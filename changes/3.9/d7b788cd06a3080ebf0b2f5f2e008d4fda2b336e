s390/uaccess: shorten strncpy_from_user/strnlen_user

Always stay within page boundaries when copying from user within
strlen_user_mvcos()/strncpy_from_user_mvcos(). This allows to
shorten the code a bit and may prevent unnecessary faults, since
we copy quite large amounts of memory to kernel space.

Also directly call the mvcos variants of copy_from_user() to
avoid indirect branches.
