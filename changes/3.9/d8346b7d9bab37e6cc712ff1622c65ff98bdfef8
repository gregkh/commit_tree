KVM: s390: Support for I/O interrupts.

Add support for handling I/O interrupts (standard, subchannel-related
ones and rudimentary adapter interrupts).

The subchannel-identifying parameters are encoded into the interrupt
type.

I/O interrupts are floating, so they can't be injected on a specific
vcpu.
