usb: gadget: consider link speed for bMaxPower

The USB 2.0 specification says that bMaxPower is the maximum power
consumption expressed in 2 mA units and the USB 3.0 specification says
that it is expressed in 8 mA units.

This patch renames bMaxPower to MaxPower and the various /2 and *2 are
removed. Before reporting the config descriptor, the proper value is
computer based on the speed, all in-tree users are updated. MaxPower is
also increased to u16 so we can store the nokia gadget value which is
larger than the max value allowed for u8.
