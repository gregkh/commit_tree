eCryptfs: allow userspace messaging to be disabled

When the userspace messaging (for the less common case of userspace key
wrap/unwrap via ecryptfsd) is not needed, allow eCryptfs to build with
it removed. This saves on kernel code size and reduces potential attack
surface by removing the /dev/ecryptfs node.
