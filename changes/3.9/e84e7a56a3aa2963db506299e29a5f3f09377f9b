virtio: rng: disallow multiple device registrations, fixes crashes

The code currently only supports one virtio-rng device at a time.
Invoking guests with multiple devices causes the guest to blow up.

Check if we've already registered and initialised the driver.  Also
cleanup in case of registration errors or hot-unplug so that a new
device can be used.
