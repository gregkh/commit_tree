sysfs: Functions for adding/removing symlinks to/from attribute groups

The most convenient way to expose ACPI power resources lists of a
device is to put symbolic links to sysfs directories representing
those resources into special attribute groups in the device's sysfs
directory.  For this purpose, it is necessary to be able to add
symbolic links to attribute groups.

For this reason, add sysfs helper functions for adding/removing
symbolic links to/from attribute groups, sysfs_add_link_to_group()
and sysfs_remove_link_from_group(), respectively.

This change set includes a build fix from David Rientjes.
