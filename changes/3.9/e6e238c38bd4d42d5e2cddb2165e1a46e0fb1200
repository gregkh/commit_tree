thermal: sysfs: Add a new sysfs node emul_temp for thermal emulation

This patch adds support to set the emulated temperature method in
thermal zone (sensor). After setting this feature thermal zone may
report this temperature and not the actual temperature. The emulation
implementation may be based on sensor capability through platform
specific handler or pure software emulation if no platform handler defined.

This is useful in debugging different temperature threshold and its
associated cooling action. Critical threshold's cannot be emulated.
Writing 0 on this node should disable emulation.
