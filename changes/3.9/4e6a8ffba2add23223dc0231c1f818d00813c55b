staging: line6: clean up line6_pod_process_message()

Previous versions of the line6 driver snooped MIDI traffic in order to
make device state accessible via sysfs attributes.  This involved a lot
of logic in line6_pod_process_message() that has since been removed.

Drop unused conditionals in line6_pod_process_message() and reduce the
levels of indentation.  Only two MIDI messages are still tracked: the
POD version message on startup and monitor level changes originating
from the device.
