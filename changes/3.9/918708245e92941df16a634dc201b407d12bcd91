x86: Fix rebuild with EFI_STUB enabled

eboot.o and efi_stub_$(BITS).o didn't get added to "targets", and hence
their .cmd files don't get included by the build machinery, leading to
the files always getting rebuilt.

Rather than adding the two files individually, take the opportunity and
add $(VMLINUX_OBJS) to "targets" instead, thus allowing the assignment
at the top of the file to be shrunk quite a bit.

At the same time, remove a pointless flags override line - the variable
assigned to was misspelled anyway, and the options added are
meaningless for assembly sources.

[ hpa: the patch is not minimal, but I am taking it for -urgent anyway
  since the excess impact of the patch seems to be small enough. ]
