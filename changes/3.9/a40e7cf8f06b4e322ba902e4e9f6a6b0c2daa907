dmi_scan: fix missing check for _DMI_ signature in smbios_present()

Commit 9f9c9cbb6057 ("drivers/firmware/dmi_scan.c: fetch dmi version
from SMBIOS if it exists") hoisted the check for "_DMI_" into
dmi_scan_machine(), which means that we don't bother to check for
"_DMI_" at offset 16 in an SMBIOS entry.  smbios_present() may also call
dmi_present() for an address where we found "_SM_", if it failed further
validation.

Check for "_DMI_" in smbios_present() before calling dmi_present().
