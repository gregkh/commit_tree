tracing: Verify target file before registering a uprobe event

Without this patch, we can register a uprobe event for a directory.
Enabling such a uprobe event would anyway fail.

Example:
$ echo 'p /bin:0x4245c0' > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/uprobe_events

However dirctories cannot be valid targets for uprobe.
Hence verify if the target is a regular file during the probe
registration.
