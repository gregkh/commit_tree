GFS2: Split glock lru processing into two parts

The intent here is to split the processing of the glock lru
list into two parts, so that the selection of glocks and the
disposal are separate functions. The plan is then, that further
updates can then be made to these functions in the future
to improve the selection of glocks and also the efficiency of
glock disposal.

The new feature which this patch brings is sorting the
glocks to be disposed of into glock number (and thus also
disk block number) order. Not all glocks will need i/o in
order to dispose of them, but some will, and at least we'll
generate mostly disk block order i/o now.
