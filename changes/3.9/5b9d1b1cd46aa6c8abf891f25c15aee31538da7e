libceph: kill op_needs_trail()

Since every osd message is now prepared to include trailing data,
there's no need to check ahead of time whether any operations will
make use of the trail portion of the message.

We can drop the second argument to get_num_ops(), and as a result we
can also get rid of op_needs_trail() which is no longer used.
