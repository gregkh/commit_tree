cpufreq: ondemand: Replace down_differential tuner with adj_up_threshold

In order to avoid the calculation of up_threshold - down_differential
every time that the frequency must be decreased, we replace the
down_differential tuner with the adj_up_threshold which keeps the
difference across multiple checks.

Update the adj_up_threshold only when the up_theshold is also updated.
