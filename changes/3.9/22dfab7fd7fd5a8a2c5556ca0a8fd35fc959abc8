Input: atmel_mxt_ts - Support for touchpad variant

This same driver can be used by atmel based touchscreens and touchpads
(buttonpads). Platform data may specify a device is a touchpad
using the is_tp flag.

This will cause the driver to perform some touchpad specific
initializations, such as:
  * register input device name "Atmel maXTouch Touchpad" instead of
  Touchscreen.
  * register BTN_LEFT & BTN_TOOL_* event types.
  * register axis resolution (as a fixed constant, for now)
  * register BUTTONPAD property
  * process GPIO buttons using reportid T19

Input event GPIO mapping is done by the platform data key_map array.

key_map[x] should contain the KEY or BTN code to send when processing
GPIOx from T19. To specify a GPIO as not an input source, populate
with KEY_RESERVED, or 0.
