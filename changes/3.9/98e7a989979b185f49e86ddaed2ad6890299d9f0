x86, mm: Make sure to find a 2M free block for the first mapped area

|    x86, mm: setup page table in top-down

It turns out that we do not calculate the real_end properly:
We try to get 2M size with 4K alignment, and later will round down
to 2M, so we will get less then 2M for first mapping, in extreme
case could be only 4K only. In Henrik's system it has (1M-32K) as
last usable rage is [mem 0x7f9db000-0x7fef8fff].

The problem is exposed when EFI booting have several holes and it
will force mapping to use PTE instead as we only map usable areas.

To fix it, just make it be 2M aligned, so we can be guaranteed to be
able to use large pages to map it.
