kcmp: make it depend on CHECKPOINT_RESTORE

Since kcmp syscall has been implemented (initially on x86 architecture) a
number of other archs wire it up as well: xtensa, sparc, sh, s390, mips,
microblaze, m68k (not taking into account those who uses
<asm-generic/unistd.h> for syscall numbers definitions).

But the Makefile, which turns kcmp.o generation on still depends on former
config-x86.  Thus get rid of this limitation and make kcmp.o depend on
CHECKPOINT_RESTORE option.
