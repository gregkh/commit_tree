thermal: check for invalid trip setup when registering thermal device

This patch adds an extra check in the data structure while registering
a thermal device. The check is to avoid registering zones with a number
of trips greater than zero, but with no .get_trip_temp nor .get_trip_type
callbacks. Receiving such data structure may end in wrong data access.
