pwm-backlight: handle BL_CORE_FBBLANK state

According to include/linux/backlight.h, the fb_blank field is to be
removed and blank status should preferably be set by setting the
BL_CORE_FBBLANK bit of the state field. This patch ensures this
condition is also taken into account when updating the backlight state.
