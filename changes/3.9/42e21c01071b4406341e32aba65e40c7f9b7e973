usbnet: smsc95xx: fix broken runtime suspend

Commit b2d4b150(smsc95xx: enable dynamic autosuspend) implements
autosuspend, but breaks current runtime suspend, such as:
when the interface becomes down, the usb device can't be put into
runtime suspend any more.

This patch fixes the broken runtime suspend.
