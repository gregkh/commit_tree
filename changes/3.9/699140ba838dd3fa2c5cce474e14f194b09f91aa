cpuset: drop async_rebuild_sched_domains()

In general, we want to make cgroup_mutex one of the outermost locks
and be able to use get_online_cpus() and friends from cgroup methods.
With cpuset hotplug made async, get_online_cpus() can now be nested
inside cgroup_mutex.

Currently, cpuset avoids nesting get_online_cpus() inside cgroup_mutex
by bouncing sched_domain rebuilding to a work item.  As such nesting
is allowed now, remove the workqueue bouncing code and always rebuild
sched_domains synchronously.  This also nests sched_domains_mutex
inside cgroup_mutex, which is intended and should be okay.
