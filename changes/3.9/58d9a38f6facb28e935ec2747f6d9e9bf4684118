PCI: Skip attaching driver in device_add()

We want to add PCI devices to the device tree as early as possible but
delay attaching drivers.

device_add() adds a device to the device hierarchy and (via
device_attach()) attaches a matching driver and calls its .probe() method.
We want to separate adding the device to the hierarchy from attaching the
driver.

This patch does that by adding "match_driver" in struct pci_dev.  When
false, we return failure from pci_bus_match(), which makes device_attach()
believe there's no matching driver.

Later, we set "match_driver = true" and call device_attach() again, which
now attaches the driver and calls its .probe() method.

fold device_attach() call into pci_bus_add_device()]
