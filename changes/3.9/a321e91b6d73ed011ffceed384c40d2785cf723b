lib/scatterlist: add simple page iterator

Add an iterator to walk through a scatter list a page at a time starting
at a specific page offset.  As opposed to the mapping iterator this is
meant to be small, performing well even in simple loops like collecting
all pages on the scatterlist into an array or setting up an iommu table
based on the pages' DMA address.
