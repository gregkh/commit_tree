iwlegacy: allow to enable PS

Power save support was removed from iwlegacy due to possible firmware
crashes problems it cause. I use to plan first inspect code to find
reason of problems, fix them and then allow to enable PS. But
realistically - code inspection will not happen, so let's do it, and
wait for eventual bug reports.
