Revert "loop: cleanup partitions when detaching loop device"

This reverts commit 8761a3dc1f07b163414e2215a2cadbb4cfe2a107.

There are situations where the destruction path is called
with the bdev->bd_mutex already held, which then deadlocks in
loop_clr_fd(). The normal partition cleanup does a trylock()
on the mutex, but it'd be nice to have a more bullet proof
method in loop. So punt this more involved fix to the next
merge window, and just back out this buggy fix for now.
