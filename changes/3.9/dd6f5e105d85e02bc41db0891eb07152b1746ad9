libceph: update ceph_fs.h

Update most of "include/linux/ceph/ceph_fs.h" to match its user
space counterpart in "src/include/ceph_fs.h" in the ceph tree.

Everything that has changed is either:
    - added definitions (therefore no real effect on existing code)
    - deleting unused symbols
    - added or revised comments

There were some differences between the struct definitions for
ceph_mon_subscribe_item and the open field of ceph_mds_request_args;
those differences remain.

This and the next commit resolve:
