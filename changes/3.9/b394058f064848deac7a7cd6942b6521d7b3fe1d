cpufreq: governors: Reset tunables only for cpufreq_unregister_governor()

Currently, whenever governor->governor() is called for CPUFRREQ_GOV_START event
we reset few tunables of governor. Which isn't correct, as this routine is
called for every cpu hot-[un]plugging event. We should actually be resetting
these only when the governor module is removed and re-installed.
