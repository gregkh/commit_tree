Revert "MIPS: BCM63XX: Call board_register_device from device_initcall()"

This commit causes a race between PCI scan and SSB fallback SPROM handler
registration, causing the wifi to not work on slower systems. The only
subsystem touched from board_register_devices is platform device
registration, which is safe as an arch init call.

This reverts commit d64ed7ada2f689d2c62af1892ca55e47d3653e36 [MIPS:
BCM63XX: Call board_register_device from device_initcall()].
