net/802/mrp: fix possible race condition when calling mrp_pdu_queue()

(Adapted from a very similar change to net/802/garp.c by Cong Wang.)

mrp_pdu_queue() should ways be called with the applicant spin lock.
mrp_uninit_applicant() only holds the rtnl lock which is not enough;
a race is possible because mrp_rcv() is called in BH context:

	mrp_rcv()
	  |->mrp_pdu_parse_msg()
	    |->mrp_pdu_parse_vecattr()
	      |->mrp_pdu_parse_vecattr_event()
	        |-> mrp_attr_event()
	          |-> mrp_pdu_append_vecattr_event()
	            |-> mrp_pdu_queue()
