ALSA: hda - Allow one chance for zero NID in connection list

The commit [2e9bf24: ALSA: hda_codec: Check for invalid zero
connections] trims the whole connection list when an invalid value is
reported by the hardware.  But some codecs (at least AD1986A) may give
a zero NID in the middle of the connection list, so dropping the whole
list isn't good for such cases.

In this patch, as a workaround, allow a single zero NID in the read
connection list.  If it hits zero twice, it's handled as an error, so
that we can avoid "too many connections" errors.
