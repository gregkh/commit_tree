Do not use RCU for current process credentials

Commit c69e8d9c0 added rcu lock to fuse/dir.c It was assuming
that 'task' is some other process but in fact this parameter always
equals to 'current'. Inline this parameter to make it more readable
and remove RCU lock as it is not needed when access current process
credentials.
