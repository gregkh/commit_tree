ARM: OMAP2+: AM33XX: hwmod: Fixup cpgmac0 hwmod entry

The current HWMOD code expects the memory region with
the IP's SYSCONFIG register to be marked with ADDR_TYPE_RT
flag.

CPGMAC0 hwmod entry specifies two memory regions and marks
both with the flag ADDR_TYPE_RT although only the 2nd region
has the SYSCONFIG register. This leads to the HWMOD code
accessing the wrong memory address for idle and standby
operations. Fix this by removing the ADDR_TYPE_RT flag from
the 1st memory region in CPGMAC0 hwmod entry.
