Revert "bonding: remove sysfs before removing devices"

This reverts commit 4de79c737b200492195ebc54a887075327e1ec1d.

This patch introduces a new bug which causes access to freed memory.
In bond_uninit: list_del(&bond->bond_list);
bond_list is linked in bond_net's dev_list which is freed by
unregister_pernet_subsys.
