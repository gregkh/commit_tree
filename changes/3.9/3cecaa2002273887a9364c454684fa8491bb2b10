perf tools: Do not include PERF-VERSION-FILE to Makefile

When make runs it tries to update the Makefile rules by reading all of
included Makefiles.  During the perf build it checks PERF-VERSION-FILE
to get the current version number.  But it triggers Makefile update so
that make runs again with the update Makefile and, in turn, users will
see duplicate CHK message on the second path.

Running make with -d option for debugging tells me this:

Actually PERF-VERSION-FILE is used only for perf.c to #define
PERF_VERSION macro.  So make it like a C header file and include it
during compiling the perf.c file will remove the need of being
included into Makefile.  Hench no need to update the Makefile and no
CHK lines anymore.
