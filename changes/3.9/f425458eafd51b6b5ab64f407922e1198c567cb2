HID: Use module_hid_driver macro

Use the new module_hid_driver macro in all HID drivers that have
a simple register/unregister init/exit.

This also converts the hid drivers that test for a failure of
hid_register_driver() and report the failure. Using module_hid_driver
in those drivers removes the failure message.
