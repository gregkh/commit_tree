kdb_main: fix help print

The help command was chopping all the usage instructions such that
they were not readable.

Example:

bta             [D|R|S|T|C|Z|E|U|I| Backtrace all processes matching state flag
per_cpu         <sym> [<bytes>] [<c Display per_cpu variables

Where as it should look like:

bta             [D|R|S|T|C|Z|E|U|I|M|A]
                                    Backtrace all processes matching state flag
per_cpu         <sym> [<bytes>] [<cpu>]
                                    Display per_cpu variables

All that is needed is to check the how long the cmd_usage is and jump
to the next line when appropriate.
