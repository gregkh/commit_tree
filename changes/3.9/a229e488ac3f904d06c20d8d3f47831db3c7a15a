net/mlx4_en: Disable RFS when running in SRIOV mode

Commit 37706996 "mlx4_en: fix allocation of CPU affinity reverse-map" fixed
a bug when mlx4_dev->caps.comp_pool is larger from the device rx rings, but
introduced a regression.

When the mlx4_core is activating its "legacy mode" (e.g when running in SRIOV
mode) w.r.t to EQs/IRQs usage, comp_pool becomes zero and we're crashing on
divide by zero alloc_cpu_rmap.

Fix that by enabling RFS only when running in non-legacy mode.
