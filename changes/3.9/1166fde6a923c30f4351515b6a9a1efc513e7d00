SUNRPC: Add barriers to ensure read ordering in rpc_wake_up_task_queue_locked

We need to be careful when testing task->tk_waitqueue in
rpc_wake_up_task_queue_locked, because it can be changed while we
are holding the queue->lock.
By adding appropriate memory barriers, we can ensure that it is safe to
test task->tk_waitqueue for equality if the RPC_TASK_QUEUED bit is set.
