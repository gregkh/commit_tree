ARC: Fix the typo in event identifier flags used by ptrace

orig_r8_IS_EXCPN and orig_r8_IS_BRKPT were same values due to a
copy/paste error. Although it looks bad and is wrong, it really doesn't
affect gdb working.

orig_r8_IS_BRKPT is the one relevant to debugging (breakpoints), since
it is used to provide EFA vs. ERET to a ptrace "stop_pc" request.

So when gdb has inserted a breakpoint, orig_r8_IS_BRKPT is already set,
and anything else (i.e. orig_r8_IS_EXCPN) becoming same as it, really
doesn't hurt gdb. The corollary case, could be nasty but nobody uses the
ptrace "stop_pc" request in that case
