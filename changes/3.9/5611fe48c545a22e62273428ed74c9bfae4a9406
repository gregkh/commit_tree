powerpc: Add support for CTS-1000 GPIO controlled system poweroff

CTS-1000 is based on P4080. GPIO 27 is used to signal the FPGA to
switch off power, and also associates IRQ 8 with front-panel button
press (which we use to call orderly_poweroff()).

The relevant device-tree looks like this:

	gpio0: gpio@130000 {
		compatible = "fsl,qoriq-gpio";
		reg = <0x130000 0x1000>;
		interrupts = <55 2 0 0>;
		#gpio-cells = <2>;
		gpio-controller;

		/* Allows powering off the system via GPIO signal. */
		gpio-halt@27 {
			compatible = "sgy,gpio-halt";
			gpios = <&gpio0 27 0>;
			interrupts = <8 1 0 0>;
		};
	};

Because the driver cannot match on sgy,gpio-halt (because the node is never
processed through of_platform), it matches on fsl,qoriq-gpio and then
checks child nodes for the matching sgy,gpio-halt. This also ensures that
the GPIO controller is detected prior to sgy_cts1000's probe callback,
since that node wont match via of_platform until the controller is
registered.

Also, because the GPIO handler for triggering system poweroff might sleep,
the IRQ uses a workqueue to call orderly_poweroff().

As a final note, this driver may be expanded for other features specific to
the CTS-1000.
