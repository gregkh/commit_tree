[media] davinci: vpbe: pass different platform names to handle different ip's

The vpbe driver can handle different platforms DM644X, DM36X and
DM355. To differentiate between this platforms venc_type/vpbe_type
was passed as part of platform data which was incorrect. The correct
way to differentiate to handle this case is by passing different
platform names.
This patch creates platform_device_id[] array supporting different
platforms and assigns id_table to the platform driver, and finally
in the probe gets the actual device by using platform_get_device_id()
and gets the appropriate driver data for that platform.
Taking this approach will also make the DT transition easier.
