batman-adv: remove useless assignment in tt_local_add()

The flag field of the tt_local_entry->common structure in
tt_local_add() is first assigned NO_FLAGS and then TT_CLIENT_NEW so
nullifying the first operation. For this reason it is safe to remove
the first assignment.

This was introuduced by ("batman-adv: keep local table consistency for
further TT_RESPONSE")
