input/joystick: use get_cycles on ARM

ARM normally has an accurate clock source, so
we can theoretically use analog joysticks more
accurately and at the same time avoid the
build warning

 #warning Precise timer not defined for this architecture.

from the joystick driver.

Now, why anybody would use that driver no ARM I have no
idea, but Ben Dooks enabled it in the s3c2410_defconfig
along with a bunch of other drivers, even though that
platform has neither ISA nor PCI support. It still
seems to be the right thing to fix this quirk.
