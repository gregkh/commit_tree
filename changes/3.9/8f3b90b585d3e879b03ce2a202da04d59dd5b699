ARM: perf: remove unnecessary checks for idx < 0

We currently check for hwx->idx < 0 in armpmu_read and armpmu_del
unnecessarily. The only case where hwc->idx < 0 is when armpmu_add
fails, in which case the event's state is set to
PERF_EVENT_STATE_INACTIVE.

The perf core will not attempt to read from an event in
PERF_EVENT_STATE_INACTIVE, and so the check in armpmu_read is
unnecessary. Similarly, if perf core cannot add an event it will not
attempt to delete it, so the WARN_ON in armpmu_del is unnecessary.

This patch removes these two redundant checks.
