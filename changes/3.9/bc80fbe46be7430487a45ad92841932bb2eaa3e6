tty: Remove ancient hardpps()

hardpps() functionality is provided through the N_PPS line
discipline now. The new function signature was added in commit
025b40ab (2011-01-12). There was no previous macro or
function hardpps(), at least since before the initial commit of
v2.6.12 in 2005. It's unlikely this code has been compiled since.
