charger_manager: Don't use [delayed_]work_pending()

There's no need to test whether a (delayed) work item in pending
before queueing, flushing or cancelling it.  Most uses are unnecessary
and quite a few of them are buggy.

Remove unnecessary pending tests and rewrite _setup_polling() so that
it uses mod_delayed_work() if the next polling interval is sooner than
currently scheduled.  queue_delayed_work() is used otherwise.

Only compile tested.  I noticed that two work items - setup_polling
and cm_monitor_work - schedule each other.  It's a very unusual
construct and I'm fairly sure it's racy.  You can't break such
circular dependency by calling cancel on each.  I strongly recommend
revising the mechanism.
