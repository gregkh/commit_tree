perf evlist: Fix set event list leader

The __perf_evlist__set_leader() was setting the leader for all events in
the list except the first. Which means it assumed the first event
already had event->leader = event.

Seems like this should be the role of the function to also do this. This
is a requirement for an upcoming patch set.
