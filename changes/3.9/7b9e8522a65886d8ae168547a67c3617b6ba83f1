nfsd: fix IPv6 address handling in the DRC

Currently, it only stores the first 16 bytes of any address. struct
sockaddr_in6 is 28 bytes however, so we're currently ignoring the last
12 bytes of the address.

Expand the c_addr field to a sockaddr_in6, and cast it to a sockaddr_in
as necessary. Also fix the comparitor to use the existing RPC
helpers for this.
