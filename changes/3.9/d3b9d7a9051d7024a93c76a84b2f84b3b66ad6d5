USB: Fix connected device switch to Inactive state.

A USB 3.0 device can transition to the Inactive state if a U1 or U2 exit
transition fails.  The current code in hub_events simply issues a warm
reset, but does not call any pre-reset or post-reset driver methods (or
unbind/rebind drivers without them).  Therefore the drivers won't know
their device has just been reset.

hub_events should instead call usb_reset_device.  This means
hub_port_reset now needs to figure out whether it should issue a warm
reset or a hot reset.

Remove the FIXME note about needing disconnect() for a NOTATTACHED
device.  This patch fixes that.
