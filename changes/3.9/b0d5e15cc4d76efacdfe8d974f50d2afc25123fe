[SCSI] bnx2fc: adjust duplicate test

Delete successive tests to the same location.  The code tested the result
of a previous allocation, that itself was already tested.  It is changed to
test the result of the most recent allocation.

A simplified version of the semantic match that finds this problem is as
follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@s exists@
local idexpression y;
expression x,e;
@@

*if ( \(x == NULL\|IS_ERR(x)\|y != 0\) )
 { ... when forall
   return ...; }
... when != \(y = e\|y += e\|y -= e\|y |= e\|y &= e\|y++\|y--\|&y\)
    when != \(XT_GETPAGE(...,y)\|WMI_CMD_BUF(...)\)
*if ( \(x == NULL\|IS_ERR(x)\|y != 0\) )
 { ... when forall
   return ...; }
// </smpl>
