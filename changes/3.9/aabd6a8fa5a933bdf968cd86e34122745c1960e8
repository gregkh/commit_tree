Revert "virtio_console: Initialize guest_connected=true for rproc_serial"

This reverts commit 8078db789a92b10ff6e2d713231b5367e014c53b, and
adds a lengthy comment explaining the problem area.

The reverted patch caused opening of ports to fail for rproc_serial.
In probe guest_connected was set to true, but port_fops_open()
fails with -EMFILE if guest_connected already is true.
