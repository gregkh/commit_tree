staging:iio: Remove noop call to __iio_update_buffer

__iio_update_buffer updates the buffer's bytes_per_datum and length fields.
But the only user of this function just passes in these exact fields, so the
call basically looks like this:

	buffer->bytes_per_datum = buffer->bytes_per_datum;
	buffer->length = buffer->length;

Which means it is a noop and can be removed. Also remove the function itself,
since it is now unused.
