kdb: Remove the ll command

Recently some code inspection was done after fixing a problem with
kmalloc used while in the kernel debugger context (which is not
legal), and it turned up the fact that kdb ll command will oops the
kernel.

Given that there have been zero bug reports on the command combined
with the fact it will oops the kernel it is clearly not being used.
Instead of fixing it, it will be removed.
