drm: review locking for drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode

... it's required. Fix up exynos and the cma helper, and add a
corresponding WARN_ON to drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode.

Note that tegra calls the fbdev cma helper restore function also from
it's driver-load callback. Which is a bit against current practice,
since usually the call is only from ->lastclose, and initial setup is
done by drm_fb_helper_initial_config.

Also add the relevant drm DocBook entry.

v2: Add promised WARN to restore_fbdev_mode.
