Btrfs: don't re-enter when allocating a chunk

If we start running low on metadata space we will try to allocate a chunk,
which could then try to allocate a chunk to add the device entry.  The thing
is we allocate a chunk before we try really hard to make the allocation, so
we should be able to find space for the device entry.  Add a flag to the
trans handle so we know we're currently allocating a chunk so we can just
bail out if we try to allocate another chunk.  Thanks,
