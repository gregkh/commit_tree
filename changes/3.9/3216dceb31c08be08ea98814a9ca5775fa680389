xen: introduce xen_remap, use it instead of ioremap

ioremap can't be used to map ring pages on ARM because it uses device
memory caching attributes (MT_DEVICE*).

Introduce a Xen specific abstraction to map ring pages, called
xen_remap, that is defined as ioremap on x86 (no behavioral changes).
On ARM it explicitly calls __arm_ioremap with the right caching
attributes: MT_MEMORY.
