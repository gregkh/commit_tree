net: Add functions netif_reset_xps_queue and netif_set_xps_queue

This patch adds two functions, netif_reset_xps_queue and
netif_set_xps_queue.  The main idea behind these two functions is to
provide a mechanism through which drivers can update their defaults in
regards to XPS.

Currently no such mechanism exists and as a result we cannot use XPS for
things such as ATR which would require a basic configuration to start in
which the Tx queues are mapped to CPUs via a 1:1 mapping.  With this change
I am making it possible for drivers such as ixgbe to be able to use the XPS
feature by controlling the default configuration.
