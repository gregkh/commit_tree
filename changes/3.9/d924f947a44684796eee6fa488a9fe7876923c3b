x86, uv, uv3: Trim MMR register definitions after code changes for SGI UV3

This patch trims the MMR register definitions after the updates for the
SGI UV3 system have been applied.  Note that because these definitions
are automatically generated from the RTL we cannot control the length
of the names.  Therefore there are lines that exceed 80 characters.
