PM: Introduce Intel PowerClamp Driver

Intel PowerClamp driver performs synchronized idle injection across
all online CPUs. The goal is to maintain a given package level C-state
ratio.

Compared to other throttling methods already exist in the kernel,
such as ACPI PAD (taking CPUs offline) and clock modulation, this is often
more efficient in terms of performance per watt.

Please refer to Documentation/thermal/intel_powerclamp.txt for more details.
