ACPICA: Update codes under disabled build options.

This is a cosmetic patch only. Comparison of the resulting binary showed
only line number differences.

This patch does not affect the generation of the Linux binary.
This patch decreases 170 lines of 20121018 divergence.diff.

This patch updates ACPICA codes surrounded by some disabled build options
so that the source code diff between Linux and ACPICA can be reduced.

Some of these build options may never be used in the kernel, so they may
be deleted entirely in future patches.
