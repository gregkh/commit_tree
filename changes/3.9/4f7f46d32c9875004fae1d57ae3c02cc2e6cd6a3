tcm_vhost: Use vq->private_data to indicate if the endpoint is setup

Currently, vs->vs_endpoint is used indicate if the endpoint is setup or
not. It is set or cleared in vhost_scsi_set_endpoint() or
vhost_scsi_clear_endpoint() under the vs->dev.mutex lock. However, when
we check it in vhost_scsi_handle_vq(), we ignored the lock.

Instead of using the vs->vs_endpoint and the vs->dev.mutex lock to
indicate the status of the endpoint, we use per virtqueue
vq->private_data to indicate it. In this way, we can only take the
vq->mutex lock which is per queue and make the concurrent multiqueue
process having less lock contention. Further, in the read side of
vq->private_data, we can even do not take the lock if it is accessed in
the vhost worker thread, because it is protected by "vhost rcu".
