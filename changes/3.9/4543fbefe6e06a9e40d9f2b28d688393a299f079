net: count hw_addr syncs so that unsync works properly.

A few drivers use dev_uc_sync/unsync to synchronize the
address lists from master down to slave/lower devices.  In
some cases (bond/team) a single address list is synched down
to multiple devices.  At the time of unsync, we have a leak
in these lower devices, because "synced" is treated as a
boolean and the address will not be unsynced for anything after
the first device/call.

Treat "synced" as a count (same as refcount) and allow all
unsync calls to work.
