mm: numa: take THP into account when migrating pages for NUMA balancing

Wanpeng Li pointed out that numamigrate_isolate_page() assumes that only
one base page is being migrated when in fact it can also be checking
THP.

The consequences are that a migration will be attempted when a target
node is nearly full and fail later.  It's unlikely to be user-visible
but it should be fixed.  While we are there, migrate_balanced_pgdat()
should treat nr_migrate_pages as an unsigned long as it is treated as a
watermark.
