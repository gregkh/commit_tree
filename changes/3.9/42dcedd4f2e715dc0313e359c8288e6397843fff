drm/i915: Use a slab for object allocation

The primary purpose of this was to debug some use-after-free memory
corruption that was causing an OOPS inside drm/i915. As it turned out
the corruption was being caused elsewhere and i915.ko as a major user of
many objects was being hit hardest.

Indeed as we do frequent the generic kmalloc caches, dedicating one to
ourselves (or at least naming one for us depending upon the core) aids
debugging our own slab usage.
