[media] s5p-fimc: Fix FIMC.n subdev set_selection ioctl handler

The V4L2_SEL_TGT_CROP_BOUNDS, V4L2_SEL_TGT_COMPOSE_BOUNDS selection
targets are not supposed to be handled in the set_selection ioctl.
Remove the code that doesn't do anything sensible now and make sure
ctx->state is modified with the spinlock held.
