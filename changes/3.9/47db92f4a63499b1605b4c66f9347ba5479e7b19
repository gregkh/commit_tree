dmaengine: ste_dma40: physical channels number correction

DMAC_ICFG[0:2]=SCHNB only allows to count 'multiple of 4' physical
channels so it was ok with platforms having 8 channels but cannot be
used for next versions (with 10 or 14 channels).  This patch allows to
provide the number of physical channels for a DMA device via
platform_data, or still rely on SCHNB if platform_data announces 0
channel.
