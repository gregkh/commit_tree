ALSA: hda - Improve naming rule for primary output

When the volume or mute control of the primary output is shared with
other (headphone or speaker) outputs, we shouldn't name it as a
specific output type but rather name it with the channel name or a
generic name like "PCM".

Also, this check should be performed individually for the volume and
the mute controls because some codecs may have shared volumes but
separate mute controls.
