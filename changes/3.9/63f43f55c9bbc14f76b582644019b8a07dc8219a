cpuset: fix cpuset_print_task_mems_allowed() vs rename() race

rename() will change dentry->d_name. The result of this race can
be worse than seeing partially rewritten name, but we might access
a stale pointer because rename() will re-allocate memory to hold
a longer name.

It's safe in the protection of dentry->d_lock.

v2: check NULL dentry before acquiring dentry lock.
