USB: storage: avoid scanning other targets for single target device

This patch sets scsi_host->max_id as 1 if the device's quirk
flag of US_FL_SCM_MULT_TARG isn't set, because there are only 6
mass storage devices marked as mutiple targets from unusual_devs.h.

This patch is a small optimization about scanning targets, and
avoid scanning other 7 non-existed targets for single target
device.
