net: fec: Fix division by zero

commit 7f7d6c282 (net: fec: Ensure that initialization is done prior to
request_irq()) placed fec_ptp_init() into a point that ptp clock was not
available, which causes a division by zero in fec_ptp_start_cyclecounter():

Fix this by rearraging the code so that fec_ptp_init() is called only after
the clocks have been properly acquired.

Tested on both mx53 and mx6 platforms.
