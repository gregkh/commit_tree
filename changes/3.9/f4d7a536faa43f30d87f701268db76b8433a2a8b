ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: make 'ocp2scp_usb_phy_phy_48m" as the main clock

Commit 92702df3570e ("ARM: OMAP4: PM: fix PM regression introduced by recent
clock cleanup") makes the 'ocp2scp_usb_phy_phy_48m' as optional
functional clock causing regression in MUSB. But this 48MHz clock is a
mandatory clock for usb phy attached to ocp2scp and hence made as the main
clock for ocp2scp.
