[media] fc0012: remove unused callback and correct one comment

There is no need to keep dummy sleep() callback implementation as
DVB-core checks existence of it before calls callback. Due to that
we can remove it.
FC0012 is based of direct-conversion receiver architecture
(aka Zero-IF) where is no IF used. Due to that IF is always 0 Hz.
Fix comment to point that.
