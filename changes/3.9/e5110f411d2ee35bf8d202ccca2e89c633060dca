sysfs: handle failure path correctly for readdir()

In case of 'if (filp->f_pos ==  0 or 1)' of sysfs_readdir(),
the failure from filldir() isn't handled, and the reference counter
of the sysfs_dirent object pointed by filp->private_data will be
released without clearing filp->private_data, so use after free
bug will be triggered later.

This patch returns immeadiately under the situation for fixing the bug,
and it is reasonable to return from readdir() when filldir() fails.
