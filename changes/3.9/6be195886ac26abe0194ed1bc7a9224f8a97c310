workqueue: replace WORK_CPU_NONE/LAST with WORK_CPU_END

Now that workqueue has moved away from gcwqs, workqueue no longer has
the need to have a CPU identifier indicating "no cpu associated" - we
now use WORK_OFFQ_POOL_NONE instead - and most uses of WORK_CPU_NONE
are gone.

The only left usage is as the end marker for for_each_*wq*()
iterators, where the name WORK_CPU_NONE is confusing w/o actual
WORK_CPU_NONE usages.  Similarly, WORK_CPU_LAST which equals
WORK_CPU_NONE no longer makes sense.

Replace both WORK_CPU_NONE and LAST with WORK_CPU_END.  This patch
doesn't introduce any functional difference.

tj: s/WORK_CPU_LAST/WORK_CPU_END/ and rewrote the description.
