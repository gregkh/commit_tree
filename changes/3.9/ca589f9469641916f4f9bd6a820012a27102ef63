ACPI / scan: Introduce struct acpi_scan_handler

Introduce struct acpi_scan_handler for representing objects that
will do configuration tasks depending on ACPI device nodes'
hardware IDs (HIDs).

Currently, those tasks are done either directly by the ACPI namespace
scanning code or by ACPI device drivers designed specifically for
this purpose.  None of the above is desirable, however, because
doing that directly in the namespace scanning code makes that code
overly complicated and difficult to follow and doing that in
"special" device drivers leads to a great deal of confusion about
their role and to confusing interactions with the driver core (for
example, sysfs directories are created for those drivers, but they
are completely unnecessary and only increase the kernel's memory
footprint in vain).
