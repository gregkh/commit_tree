efivars: Allow disabling use as a pstore backend

Add a new option, CONFIG_EFI_VARS_PSTORE, which can be set to N to
avoid using efivars as a backend to pstore, as some users may want to
compile out the code completely.

Set the default to Y to maintain backwards compatability, since this
feature has always been enabled until now.
