bridge: reserve space for IFLA_BRPORT_FAST_LEAVE

The bridge multicast fast leave feature was added sufficient space
was not reserved in the netlink message. This means the flag may be
lost in netlink events and results of queries.

Found by observation while looking up some netlink stuff for discussion with Vlad.
