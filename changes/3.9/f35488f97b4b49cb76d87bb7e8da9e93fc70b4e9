perf tools: Add support for wildcard in tracepoint system name

Adding support for wildcards '*?" in the tracepoint system part.

It's now possible to open all available tracepoints like:

  # perf stat -e '*:*' ls

You might need to increase limit for open files via ulimit.

If ftrace events tracepoints are configured in, the record command fails
on above event selection because of them.

The stat command disables counters that fails to open, the record
command fails completely. We probably want to be smarter here.
