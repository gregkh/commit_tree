KVM: Increase user memory slots on x86 to 125

With the 3 private slots, this gives us a nice round 128 slots total.
The primary motivation for this is to support more assigned devices.
Each assigned device can theoretically use up to 8 slots (6 MMIO BARs,
1 ROM BAR, 1 spare for a split MSI-X table mapping) though it's far
more typical for a device to use 3-4 slots.  If we assume a typical VM
uses a dozen slots for non-assigned devices purposes, we should always
be able to support 14 worst case assigned devices or 28 to 37 typical
devices.
