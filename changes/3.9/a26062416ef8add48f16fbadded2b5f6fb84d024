dm ioctl: allow message to return data

This patch introduces enhanced message support that allows the
device-mapper core to recognise messages that are common to all devices,
and for messages to return data to userspace.

Core messages are processed by the function "message_for_md".  If the
device mapper doesn't support the message, it is passed to the target
driver.

If the message returns data, the kernel sets the flag
DM_MESSAGE_OUT_FLAG.
