dmaengine: at_hdmac: fix race condition in atc_advance_work()

The BUG_ON() directive is triggered probably due to a latency
modification following inclusion of commit c10d73671ad3 ("softirq:
reduce latencies").  This condition has not been met before 3.9-rc1 and
doesn't trigger without this patch.

We now make sure that DMA channel is idle before calling
atc_complete_all() which makes the BUG_ON() "protection" useless.
