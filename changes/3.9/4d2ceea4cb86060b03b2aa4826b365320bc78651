cfq-iosched: More renaming to better represent wl_class and wl_type

Some more renaming. Again making the code uniform w.r.t use of
wl_class/class to represent IO class (RT, BE, IDLE) and using
wl_type/type to represent subclass (SYNC, SYNC-IDLE, ASYNC).

At places this patch shortens the string "workload" to "wl".
Renamed "saved_workload" to "saved_wl_type". Renamed
"saved_serving_class" to "saved_wl_class".

For uniformity with "saved_wl_*" variables, renamed "serving_class"
to "serving_wl_class" and renamed "serving_type" to "serving_wl_type".

Again, just trying to improve upon code uniformity and improve
readability. No functional change.

v2:
- Restored the usage of keyword "service" based on Jeff Moyer's feedback.
