goldfish: add QEMU pipe driver

A QEMU pipe is a very fast communication channel between the
guest system and the emulator. Usage from the guest is simply
something like;

  // connect to special device
  fd = open("/dev/qemu_pipe", O_RDWR);

  // tell which service we want to talk to (must be zero-terminated)
  write(fd, "pipeName", strlen("pipeName")+1);

  // do read()/write() through fd now
  ...

  // close channel
  close(fd);
