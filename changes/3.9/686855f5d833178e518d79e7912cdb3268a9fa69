sched: add wait_for_completion_io[_timeout]

The only difference between wait_for_completion[_timeout]() and
wait_for_completion_io[_timeout]() is that the latter calls
io_schedule_timeout() instead of schedule_timeout() so that the caller
is accounted as waiting for IO, not just sleeping.

These functions can be used for correct iowait time accounting when the
completion struct is actually used for waiting for IO (e.g. completion
of a bio request in the block layer).
