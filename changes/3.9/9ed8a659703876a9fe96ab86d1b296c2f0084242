cgroup: remove bogus comments in cgroup_diput()

Since commit 48ddbe194623ae089cc0576e60363f2d2e85662a
("cgroup: make css->refcnt clearing on cgroup removal optional"),
each css holds a ref on cgroup's dentry, so cgroup_diput() won't be
called until all css' refs go down to 0, which invalids the comments.
