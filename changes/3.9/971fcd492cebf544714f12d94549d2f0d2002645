usb: add runtime pm support for usb port device

This patch is to add runtime pm callback for usb port device.
Set/clear PORT_POWER feature in the resume/suspend callback.
Add portnum for struct usb_port to record port number. Do
pm_rumtime_get_sync/put(portdev) when a device is plugged/unplugged
to prevent it from being powered off when it is active.
