dmatest: Fix NULL pointer dereference on ioat

device_control is an optional and not implemented in all DMA drivers.
Any calls to these will result in a NULL pointer dereference.  dmatest
makes two of these calls when completing the kernel thread and removing
the module.  These are corrected by calling the dmaengine_device_control
wrapper and checking for a non-existant device_control function pointer
there.
