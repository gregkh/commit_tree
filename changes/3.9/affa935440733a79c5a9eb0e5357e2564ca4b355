drm/i915: add HAS_DDI check

And use it whenever we call code that uses the DDIs. We already have
intel_ddi.c and prefix every function with intel_ddi_something instead of
haswell_something, so I think replacing the checks with HAS_DDI makes more
sense. Just a cosmetical change, yes I know, but I have this OCD...
