ACPI / scan: Make namespace scanning and trimming mutually exclusive

There is no guarantee that acpi_bus_scan() and acpi_bus_trim() will
not be run in parallel for the same scope of the ACPI namespace,
which may lead to a great deal of confusion, so introduce a new mutex
to prevent that from happening.
