ext4: use percpu counter for extent cache count

Use a percpu counter rather than atomic types for shrinker accounting.
There's no need for ultimate accuracy in the shrinker, so this
should come a little more cheaply.  The percpu struct is somewhat
large, but there was a big gap before the cache-aligned
s_es_lru_lock anyway, and it fits nicely in there.
