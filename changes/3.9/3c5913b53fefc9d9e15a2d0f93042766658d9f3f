bonding: primary_slave & curr_active_slave are not cleaned on enslave failure

On enslave failure primary_slave can point to new_slave which is to be
freed, and the same applies to curr_active_slave. So check if this is
the case and clean up properly after err_detach because that's the first
error code path after they're set.
