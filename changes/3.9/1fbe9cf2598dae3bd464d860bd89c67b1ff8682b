powerpc: Build kernel with -mcmodel=medium

Finally remove the two level TOC and build with -mcmodel=medium.

Unfortunately we can't build modules with -mcmodel=medium due to
the tricks the kernel module loader plays with percpu data:

# -mcmodel=medium breaks modules because it uses 32bit offsets from
# the TOC pointer to create pointers where possible. Pointers into the
# percpu data area are created by this method.
#
# The kernel module loader relocates the percpu data section from the
# original location (starting with 0xd...) to somewhere in the base
# kernel percpu data space (starting with 0xc...). We need a full
# 64bit relocation for this to work, hence -mcmodel=large.

On older kernels we fall back to the two level TOC (-mminimal-toc)
