Btrfs: fix wrong reserved space in qgroup during snap/subv creation

There are two problems in the space reservation of the snapshot/
subvolume creation.
- don't reserve the space for the root item insertion
- the space which is reserved in the qgroup is different with
  the free space reservation. we need reserve free space for
  7 items, but in qgroup reservation, we need reserve space only
  for 3 items.

So we implement new metadata reservation functions for the
snapshot/subvolume creation.
