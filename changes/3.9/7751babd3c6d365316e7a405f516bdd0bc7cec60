KVM: MMU: fix infinite fault access retry

We have two issues in current code:
- if target gfn is used as its page table, guest will refault then kvm will use
  small page size to map it. We need two #PF to fix its shadow page table

- sometimes, say a exception is triggered during vm-exit caused by #PF
  (see handle_exception() in vmx.c), we remove all the shadow pages shadowed
  by the target gfn before go into page fault path, it will cause infinite
  loop:
  delete shadow pages shadowed by the gfn -> try to use large page size to map
  the gfn -> retry the access ->...

To fix these, we can adjust page size early if the target gfn is used as page
table
