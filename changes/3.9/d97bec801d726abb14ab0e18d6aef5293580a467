nfs: idr_destroy() no longer needs idr_remove_all()

idr_destroy() can destroy idr by itself and idr_remove_all() is being
deprecated.  Drop reference to idr_remove_all().  Note that the code
wasn't completely correct before because idr_remove() on all entries
doesn't necessarily release all idr_layers which could lead to memory
leak.
