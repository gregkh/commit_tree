regmap: Add "no-bus" option for regmap API

This commit adds provision for "no-bus" usage of the regmap API. In
this configuration user can provide API with two callbacks 'reg_read'
and 'reg_write' which are to be called when reads and writes to one of
device's registers is performed. This is useful for devices that
expose registers but whose register access sequence does not fit the 'bus'
abstraction.
