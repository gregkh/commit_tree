ARM: iWMMXt: always enable iWMMXt support with PJ4 CPUs

Jason Cooper reports these build errors:
arch/arm/kernel/built-in.o: In function `iwmmxt_do':
/.../arch/arm/kernel/pj4-cp0.c:36: undefined reference to `iwmmxt_task_release'
/.../arch/arm/kernel/pj4-cp0.c:40: undefined reference to `iwmmxt_task_switch'
make: *** [vmlinux] Error 1

This is caused because the PJ4 code explicitly references the iWMMXt
code, but doesn't require it to be built.  Fix this by ensuring that
iWMMXt is always enabled with PJ4.
