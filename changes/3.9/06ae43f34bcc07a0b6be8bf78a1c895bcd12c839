Don't bother with redoing rw_verify_area() from default_file_splice_from()

default_file_splice_from() ends up calling vfs_write() (via very convoluted
callchain).  It's an overkill, since we already have done rw_verify_area()
in the caller by the time we call vfs_write() we are under set_fs(KERNEL_DS),
so access_ok() is also pointless.  Add a new helper (__kernel_write()),
use it instead of kernel_write() in there.
