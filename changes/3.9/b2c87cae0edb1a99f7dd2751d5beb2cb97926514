GFS2: Issue discards in 512b sectors

This patch changes GFS2's discard issuing code so that it calls
function sb_issue_discard rather than blkdev_issue_discard. The
code was calling blkdev_issue_discard and specifying the correct
sector offset and sector size, but blkdev_issue_discard expects
these values to be in terms of 512 byte sectors, even if the native
sector size for the device is different. Calling sb_issue_discard
with the BLOCK size instead ensures the correct block-to-512b-sector
translation. I verified that "minlen" is specified in blocks, so
comparing it to a number of blocks is correct.
