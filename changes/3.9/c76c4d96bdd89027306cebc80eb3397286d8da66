GFS2: Merge gfs2_attach_bufdata() into trans.c

The locking in gfs2_attach_bufdata() was type specific (data/meta)
which made the function rather confusing. This patch moves the core
of gfs2_attach_bufdata() into trans.c renaming it gfs2_alloc_bufdata()
and moving the locking into gfs2_trans_add_data()/gfs2_trans_add_meta()

As a result all of the locking related to adding data and metadata to
the journal is now in these two functions. This should help to clarify
what is going on, and give us some opportunities to simplify in
some cases.
