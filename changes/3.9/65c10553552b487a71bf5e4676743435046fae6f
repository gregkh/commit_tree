kprobes: Make hash_64() as always inlined

Because hash_64() is called from the get_kprobe() inside
int3 handler, kernel causes int3 recursion and crashes if
kprobes user puts a probe on it.

Usually hash_64() is inlined into caller function, but in
some cases, it has instances by gcc's interprocedural
constant propagation.

This patch uses __always_inline instead of inline to
prevent gcc from doing such things.
