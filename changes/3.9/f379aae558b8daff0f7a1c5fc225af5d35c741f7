KVM: s390: In-kernel handling of I/O instructions.

Explicitely catch all channel I/O related instructions intercepts
in the kernel and set condition code 3 for them.

This paves the way for properly handling these instructions later
on.

Note: This is not architecture compliant (the previous code wasn't
either) since setting cc 3 is not the correct thing to do for some
of these instructions. For Linux guests, however, it still has the
intended effect of stopping css probing.
