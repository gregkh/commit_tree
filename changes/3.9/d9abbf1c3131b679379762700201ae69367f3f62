Btrfs: fix locking on ROOT_REPLACE operations in tree mod log

To resolve backrefs, ROOT_REPLACE operations in the tree mod log are
required to be tied to at least one KEY_REMOVE_WHILE_FREEING operation.
Therefore, those operations must be enclosed by tree_mod_log_write_lock()
and tree_mod_log_write_unlock() calls.

Those calls are private to the tree_mod_log_* functions, which means that
removal of the elements of an old root node must be logged from
tree_mod_log_insert_root. This partly reverts and corrects commit ba1bfbd5
(Btrfs: fix a tree mod logging issue for root replacement operations).

This fixes the brand-new version of xfstest 276 as of commit cfe73f71.
