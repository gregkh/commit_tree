acer-wmi: support Lenovo ideapad S205 1038DPG wifi switch

Found another Lenovo ideapad S205 the product name is 1038DPG, it has
a 0x78 EC register exposes the state of wifi hardware switch on the machine.

So, add this patch to support Lenovo ideapad S205-1038DPG wifi hardware
switch in acer-wmi driver.

Evidently the Ideapad S205 is just a model name on the market, but they have
totally different product name in DMI table.
