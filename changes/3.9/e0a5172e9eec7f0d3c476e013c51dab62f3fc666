thermal: rcar: add interrupt support

This patch adds interrupt support for R-Car thermal driver.

New generation R-Car thermal sensor interrupt controller was
different from old generation.
This patch supports new generation sensor only,
since the old generation interrupt controller had never been used before,
and will never be used in the future.
