pstore: Create a convenient mount point for pstore

Using /dev/pstore as a mount point for the pstore filesystem is slightly
awkward.  We don't normally mount filesystems in /dev/ and the /dev/pstore
file isn't created automatically by anything.  While this method will
still work, we can create a persistent mount point in sysfs.  This will
put pstore on par with things like cgroups and efivarfs.
