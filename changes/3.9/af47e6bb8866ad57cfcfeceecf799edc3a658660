ARM: davinci: psc: introduce reset API

Introduce an IP reset API for use on DaVinci SoC.

There is no existing "reset" framework support for SoC devices.
The remoteproc driver needs explicit control of the DSP's reset line.
To support this, a new DaVinci specific API is added.

This private API will disappear with DT migration.  Some discussion
regarding a proposed DT "reset" binding is here:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/1635051/

Modify davinci_clk_init() to set clk "reset" function for clocks
that indicate PSC_LRST support.  Also fix indentation issue with
function opening curly brace.
