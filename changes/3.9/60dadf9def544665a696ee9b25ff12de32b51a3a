Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _PHS_DEVICE_EXTENSION and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _PHS_DEVICE_EXTENSION, and
changes the name of the struct to bcm_phs_extension. In
addition, any calls to struct "PHS_DEVICE_EXTENSION, or
*PPHS_DEVICE_EXTENSION;" are changed to call directly.
