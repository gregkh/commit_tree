mm: make do_mmap_pgoff return populate as a size in bytes, not as a bool

do_mmap_pgoff() rounds up the desired size to the next PAGE_SIZE
multiple, however there was no equivalent code in mm_populate(), which
caused issues.

This could be fixed by introduced the same rounding in mm_populate(),
however I think it's preferable to make do_mmap_pgoff() return populate
as a size rather than as a boolean, so we don't have to duplicate the
size rounding logic in mm_populate().
