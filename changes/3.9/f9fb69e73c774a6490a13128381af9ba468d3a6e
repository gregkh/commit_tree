crypto: omap-aes - Add CTR algorithm Support

The OMAP3 and OMAP4/AM33xx versions of the AES crypto
module support the CTR algorithm in addition to ECB
and CBC that the OMAP2 version of the module supports.

So, OMAP2 and OMAP3 share a common register set but
OMAP3 supports CTR while OMAP2 doesn't.  OMAP4/AM33XX
uses a different register set from OMAP2/OMAP3 and
also supports CTR.

To add this support, use the platform_data introduced
in an ealier commit to hold the list of algorithms
supported by the current module.  The probe routine
will use that list to register the correct algorithms.

Note: The code being integrated is from the TI AM33xx SDK
and was written by Greg Turner <gkmturner@gmail.com> and
Herman Schuurman (current email unknown) while at TI.
