ACPI / I2C: Use parent's ACPI_HANDLE() in acpi_i2c_register_devices()

The ACPI handle of struct i2c_adapter's dev member should not be
set, because this causes that struct i2c_adapter to be associated
with the ACPI device node corresponding to its parent as the
second "physical_device", which is incorrect (this happens during
the registration of struct i2c_adapter).  Consequently,
acpi_i2c_register_devices() should use the ACPI handle of the
parent of the struct i2c_adapter it is called for rather than the
struct i2c_adapter's ACPI handle (which should be NULL).

Make that happen and modify the i2c-designware-platdrv driver,
which currently is the only driver for ACPI-enumerated I2C
controller chips, not to set the ACPI handle for the
struct i2c_adapter it creates.
