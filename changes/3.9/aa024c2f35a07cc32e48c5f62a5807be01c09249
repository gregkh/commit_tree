KVM: ARM: Power State Coordination Interface implementation

Implement the PSCI specification (ARM DEN 0022A) to control
virtual CPUs being "powered" on or off.

PSCI/KVM is detected using the KVM_CAP_ARM_PSCI capability.

A virtual CPU can now be initialized in a "powered off" state,
using the KVM_ARM_VCPU_POWER_OFF feature flag.

The guest can use either SMC or HVC to execute a PSCI function.
