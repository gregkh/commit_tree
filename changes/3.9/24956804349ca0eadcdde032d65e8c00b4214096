NFSv4.1: Always clear the NFS_INO_LAYOUTCOMMIT in layoutreturn

Note that clearing NFS_INO_LAYOUTCOMMIT is tricky, since it requires
you to also clear the NFS_LSEG_LAYOUTCOMMIT bits from the layout
segments.
The only two sites that need to do this are the ones that call
pnfs_return_layout() without first doing a layout commit.
