ext4: fix xattr block allocation/release with bigalloc

Currently when new xattr block is created or released we we would call
dquot_free_block() or dquot_alloc_block() respectively, among the else
decrementing or incrementing the number of blocks assigned to the
inode by one block.

This however does not work for bigalloc file system because we always
allocate/free the whole cluster so we have to count with that in
dquot_free_block() and dquot_alloc_block() as well.

Use the clusters-to-blocks conversion EXT4_C2B() when passing number of
blocks to the dquot_alloc/free functions to fix the problem.

The problem has been revealed by xfstests #117 (and possibly others).
