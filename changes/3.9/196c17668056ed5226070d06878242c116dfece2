ALSA: hda - Manage using output/loopback path indices

Instead of search for the path with the certain route at each time,
keep the path index for each output and loopback, and just use it when
referred.

In this implementation, the path index number begins with one, not
zero (although I've been writing in C over decades).  It's just to
make the check for uninitialized values easier.

So far, the input paths aren't handled with indices yet, but still
picked up via snd_hda_get_nid_path() at each time.
