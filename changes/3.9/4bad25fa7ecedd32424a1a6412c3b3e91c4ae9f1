vmxnet3: fix messages printed before registration

This messages that occur during boot time from this device
when netdev_err is called before calling register_netdevice().
Switch to using dev_XXX macros which correlate message with PCI info which
is available.

Rather than fixing the features message, just remove it since
the information is redundant and available through ethtool.
