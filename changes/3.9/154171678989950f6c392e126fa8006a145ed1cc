libceph: eliminate sparse warnings

Eliminate most of the problems in the libceph code that cause sparse
to issue warnings.
    - Convert functions that are never referenced externally to have
      static scope.
    - Pass NULL rather than 0 for a pointer argument in one spot in
      ceph_monc_delete_snapid()

This partially resolves:
