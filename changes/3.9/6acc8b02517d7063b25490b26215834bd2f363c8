memcg: clean up swap accounting initialization code

Memcg swap accounting is currently enabled by enable_swap_cgroup when
the root cgroup is created.  mem_cgroup_init acts as a memcg subsystem
initializer which sounds like a much better place for enable_swap_cgroup
as well.  We already register memsw files from there so it makes a lot
of sense to merge those two into a single enable_swap_cgroup function.

This patch doesn't introduce any semantic changes.
