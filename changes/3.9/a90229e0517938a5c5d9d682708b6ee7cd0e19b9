ALSA: hda - Consolidate cap_sync_hook and capture_switch_hook

Two hooks in hda_gen_spec, cap_sync_hook and capture_switch_hook, play
very similar roles.  The only differences are that the former is
called more often (e.g. at init or switching capsrc) while the latter
can take an on/off argument.

As a more generic implementation, consolidate these two hooks, and
pass snd_ctl_elem_value pointer as the second argument.  If the
secondary argument is non-NULL, it can take the on/off value, so the
caller handles it like the former capture_switch_hook.  If it's NULL,
it's called in the init or capsrc switch case.
