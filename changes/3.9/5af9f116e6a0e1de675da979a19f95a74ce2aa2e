drm/exynos: fix wrong pointer access at vm close.

This patch fixes wrong pointer access issue to filp->f_op and
filp->private_data.

The exynos_drm_gem_mmap_ioctl() changes filp->f_op and
filp->private_data temporarily and restore them to use
original ones in exynos_drm_gem_mmap_buffer() but there
was no lock between the changing and the restoring so
wrong pointer access to filp->f_op and filp->private_data
was induced by vm close callback.

So this patch uses mutex lock properly to resolve this issue.
