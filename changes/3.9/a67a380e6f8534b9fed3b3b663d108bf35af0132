dlm: don't use idr_remove_all()

idr_destroy() can destroy idr by itself and idr_remove_all() is being
deprecated.

The conversion isn't completely trivial for recover_idr_clear() as it's
the only place in kernel which makes legitimate use of idr_remove_all()
w/o idr_destroy().  Replace it with idr_remove() call inside
idr_for_each_entry() loop.  It goes on top so that it matches the
operation order in recover_idr_del().
