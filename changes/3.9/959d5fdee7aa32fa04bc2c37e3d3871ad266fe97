netpoll: fix smatch warnings in netpoll core code

Dan Carpenter contacted me with some notes regarding some smatch warnings in the
netpoll code, some of which I introduced with my recent netpoll locking fixes,
some which were there prior.   Specifically they were:

net-next/net/core/netpoll.c:243 netpoll_poll_dev() warn: inconsistent
  returns mutex:&ni->dev_lock: locked (213,217) unlocked (210,243)
net-next/net/core/netpoll.c:706 netpoll_neigh_reply() warn: potential
  pointer math issue ('skb_transport_header(send_skb)' is a 128 bit pointer)

This patch corrects the locking imbalance (the first error), and adds some
parenthesis to correct the second error.  Tested by myself. Applies to net-next
