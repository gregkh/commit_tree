x86, kdump: Change crashkernel_high/low= to crashkernel=,high/low

Per hpa, use crashkernel=X,high crashkernel=Y,low instead of
crashkernel_hign=X crashkernel_low=Y. As that could be extensible.

-v2: according to Vivek, change delimiter to ;
-v3: let hign and low only handle simple form and it conforms to
	description in kernel-parameters.txt
     still keep crashkernel=X override any crashkernel=X,high
        crashkernel=Y,low
-v4: update get_last_crashkernel returning and add more strict
     checking in parse_crashkernel_simple() found by HATAYAMA.
-v5: Change delimiter back to , according to HPA.
     also separate parse_suffix from parse_simper according to vivek.
	so we can avoid @pos in that path.
-v6: Tight the checking about crashkernel=X,highblahblah,high
     found by HTYAYAMA.
