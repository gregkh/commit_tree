ima: set appraise status in fix mode only when xattr is fixed

When a file system is mounted read-only, setting the xattr value in
fix mode fails with an error code -EROFS.  The xattr should be fixed
after the file system is remounted read-write.  This patch verifies
that the set xattr succeeds, before setting the appraise status value
to INTEGRITY_PASS.
