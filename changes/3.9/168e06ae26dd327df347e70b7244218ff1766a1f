drivers/net: delete old parallel port de600/de620 drivers

The parallel port is largely replaced by USB, and even in the
day where these drivers were current, the documented speed was
less than 100kB/s.  Let us not pretend that anyone cares about
these drivers anymore, or worse - pretend that anyone is using
them on a modern kernel.

As a side bonus, this is the end of legacy parallel port ethernet,
so we get to drop the whole chunk relating to that in the legacy
Space.c file containing the non-PCI unified probe dispatch.
