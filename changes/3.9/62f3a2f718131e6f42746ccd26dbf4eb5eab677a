ALSA: hda - More strict correction of invalid pinctl bits

Check more strictly about the validity of pinctl values in
snd_hda_set_pin_ctl() and correct the wrong bits automatically.
Also provide the helper function to correct pinctl bits to codec
drivers.

This automatically fixes the invalid pinctl writes that are found in
a few Realtek fixups for NID 0x0f amp like ASUS A6Rp.
