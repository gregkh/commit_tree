ALSA: hda - Remove speaker clicks on CX20549

This chip needs the speaker pin to go to D3 to avoid clicks,
so default_power_filter does not work here.

This was found on Thinkpad R61i/T61i but I guess it applies to
the entire chip. If not, quirks should be set for at least
PCI SSID 17aa:20ac.

Thanks to c4pp4 for testing.
