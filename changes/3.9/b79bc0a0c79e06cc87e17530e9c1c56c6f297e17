ksm: enable KSM page migration

Migration of KSM pages is now safe: remove the PageKsm restrictions from
mempolicy.c and migrate.c.

But keep PageKsm out of __unmap_and_move()'s anon_vma contortions, which
are irrelevant to KSM: it looks as if that code was preventing hotremove
migration of KSM pages, unless they happened to be in swapcache.

There is some question as to whether enforcing a NUMA mempolicy migration
ought to migrate KSM pages, mapped into entirely unrelated processes; but
moving page_mapcount > 1 is only permitted with MPOL_MF_MOVE_ALL anyway,
and it seems reasonable to assume that you wouldn't set MADV_MERGEABLE on
any area where this is a worry.
