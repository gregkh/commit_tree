tg3: Update link_up flag for phylib devices

Commit f4a46d1f46a8fece34edd2023e054072b02e110d introduced a bug where
the ifconfig stats would remain 0 for phylib devices. This is due to
tp->link_up flag never becoming true causing tg3_periodic_fetch_stats()
to return.

The link_up flag was being updated in tg3_test_and_report_link_chg()
after setting up the phy. This function however, is not called for
phylib devices since the driver does not do the phy setup.

This patch moves the link_up flag update into the common
tg3_link_report() function that gets called for phylib devices as well
for non phylib devices when the link state changes.

To avoid updating link_up twice, we replace tg3_carrier_...() calls that
are followed by tg3_link_report(), with netif_carrier_...(). We can then
remove the unused tg3_carrier_on() function.
