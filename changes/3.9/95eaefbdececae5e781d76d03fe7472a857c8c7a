ext4: fix the number of credits needed for acl ops with inline data

Operations which modify extended attributes may need extra journal
credits if inline data is used, since there is a chance that some
extended attributes may need to get pushed to an external attribute
block.

Changes to reflect this was made in xattr.c, but they were missed in
fs/ext4/acl.c.  To fix this, abstract the calculation of the number of
credits needed for xattr operations to an inline function defined in
ext4_jbd2.h, and use it in acl.c and xattr.c.

Also move the function declarations used in inline.c from xattr.h
(where they are non-obviously hidden, and caused problems since
ext4_jbd2.h needs to use the function ext4_has_inline_data), and move
them to ext4.h.
