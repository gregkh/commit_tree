ARC: make a copy of flat DT

The flat DT (currently embedded in vmlinux) is in .init section.
The unflattened/binary tree doesn't copy strings through and references
them from orig flat DT - which could cause catestrohpy if of_* APIs are
called post init, say from a driver which is a loadable module.
