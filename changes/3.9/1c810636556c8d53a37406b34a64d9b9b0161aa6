KVM: PPC: BookE: Implement EPR exit

The External Proxy Facility in FSL BookE chips allows the interrupt
controller to automatically acknowledge an interrupt as soon as a
core gets its pending external interrupt delivered.

Today, user space implements the interrupt controller, so we need to
check on it during such a cycle.

This patch implements logic for user space to enable EPR exiting,
disable EPR exiting and EPR exiting itself, so that user space can
acknowledge an interrupt when an external interrupt has successfully
been delivered into the guest vcpu.
