pseries/iommu: Ensure TCEs are cleared with non-huge DDW

There are now two kinds of DMA windows that might be presented by
PowerVM DDW support -- huge windows (that can map all of system memory
regardless of the LPAR configuration) and non-huge windows (which
can't). They are implemented slightly differently in PowerVM, and thus
have different characteristics. The most obvious is that slot isolate
doesn't clear the TCEs/window for us with non-huge windows. Thus, when a
DLPAR operation occurs on a slot using a non-huge window, TCEs are still
present (the notifier chain doesn't currently remove them explicitly)
and the DLPAR fails. Fix this by calling remove_ddw() first, which will
unmap the DDW TCEs.

Note: a corresponding change to drmgr is needed to actually successfully
DLPAR, such that the device-tree update (which causes the notifier chain
to fire) occurs before slot isolate.
