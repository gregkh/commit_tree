Btrfs: remove unnecessary dget_parent/dput when creating the pending snapshot

Since we have grabbed the parent inode at the beginning of the
snapshot creation, and both sync and async snapshot creation
release it after the pending snapshots are actually created,
it is safe to access the parent inode directly during the snapshot
creation, we needn't use dget_parent/dput to fix the parent dentry
and get the dir inode.
