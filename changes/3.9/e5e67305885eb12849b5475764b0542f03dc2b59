skbuff: Move definition of NETDEV_FRAG_PAGE_MAX_SIZE

In order to address the fact that some devices cannot support the full 32K
frag size we need to have the value accessible somewhere so that we can use it
to do comparisons against what the device can support.  As such I am moving
the values out of skbuff.c and into skbuff.h.
