spi/mpc512x-psc: optionally keep PSC SS asserted across xfer segmensts

Some SPI slave devices require asserted chip select signal across
multiple transfer segments of an SPI message. Currently the driver
always de-asserts the internal SS signal for every single transfer
segment of the message and ignores the 'cs_change' flag of the
transfer description. Disable the internal chip select (SS) only
if this is needed and indicated by the 'cs_change' flag.

Without this change, each partial transfer of a surrounding
multi-part SPI transaction might erroneously change the SS
signal, which might prevent slaves from answering the request
that was sent in a previous transfer segment because the
transaction could be considered aborted (SS was de-asserted
before reading the response).
