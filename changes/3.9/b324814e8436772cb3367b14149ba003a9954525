libceph: use void pointers in page vector functions

The functions used for working with ceph page vectors are defined
with char pointers, but they're really intended to operate on
untyped data.  Change the types of these function parameters
to (void *) to reflect this.

(Note that the functions now assume void pointer arithmetic works
like arithmetic on char pointers.)
