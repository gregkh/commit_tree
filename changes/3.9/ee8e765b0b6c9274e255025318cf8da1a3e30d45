ALSA: hda - Revive snd_hda_get_conn_list()

Manage the connection list cache using linked lists instead of
snd_array, and revive snd_hda_get_conn_list() again, so that we don't
have to keep the expanded values locally.
This will reduce the stack usage by recursive call of
snd_hda_get_conn_index() or parse_nid_path() of the generic parser.

The list management doesn't include any mutex protection, thus the
caller needs to take care of race appropriately.
