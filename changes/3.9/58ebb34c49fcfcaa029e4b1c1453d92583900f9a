md: raid0: fix error return from create_stripe_zones.

Create_stripe_zones returns an error slightly differently to
raid0_run and to raid0_takeover_*.

The error returned used by the second was wrong and an error would
result in mddev->private being set to NULL and sooner or later a
crash.

So never return NULL, return ERR_PTR(err), not NULL from
create_stripe_zones.

This bug has been present since 2.6.35 so the fix is suitable
for any kernel since then.
