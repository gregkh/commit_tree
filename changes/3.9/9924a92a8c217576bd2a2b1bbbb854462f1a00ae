ext4: pass context information to jbd2__journal_start()

So we can better understand what bits of ext4 are responsible for
long-running jbd2 handles, use jbd2__journal_start() so we can pass
context information for logging purposes.

The recommended way for finding the longer-running handles is:

   T=/sys/kernel/debug/tracing
   EVENT=$T/events/jbd2/jbd2_handle_stats
   echo "interval > 5" > $EVENT/filter
   echo 1 > $EVENT/enable

   ./run-my-fs-benchmark

   cat $T/trace > /tmp/problem-handles

This will list handles that were active for longer than 20ms.  Having
longer-running handles is bad, because a commit started at the wrong
time could stall for those 20+ milliseconds, which could delay an
fsync() or an O_SYNC operation.  Here is an example line from the
trace file describing a handle which lived on for 311 jiffies, or over
1.2 seconds:

postmark-2917  [000] ....   196.435786: jbd2_handle_stats: dev 254,32 
   tid 570 type 2 line_no 2541 interval 311 sync 0 requested_blocks 1
   dirtied_blocks 0
