ALSA: hda - Move the call of snd_hda_parse_pin_defcfg() from snd_hda_gen_parse_auto_config()

In some cases, we want to manipulate the auto_pin_cfg table before
passing to snd_hda_gen_parse_auto_config() (e.g. Realtek SSID check
code fiddles with the headphone pin).   Also passing ignore_pins just
for snd_hda_parse_pin_defcfg() isn't good.

In this patch, snd_hda_gen_parse_auto_config() is changed to receive
the auto_pin_cfg table to be parsed.  The passed auto_pin_cfg table
must have been initialized (typically by calling
snd_hda_gen_parse_auto_config()) beforehand by the caller.

Also together with this change, spec->parse_flags is also removed.
Since this was referred only at the place calling
snd_hda_parse_pin_defcfg(), no longer needed to be kept in spec.
