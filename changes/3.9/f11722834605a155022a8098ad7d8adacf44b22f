dlm: avoid scanning unchanged toss lists

Keep track of whether a toss list contains any
shrinkable rsbs.  If not, dlm_scand can avoid
scanning the list for rsbs to shrink.  Unnecessary
scanning can otherwise waste a lot of time because
the toss lists can contain a large number of rsbs
that are non-shrinkable (directory records).
