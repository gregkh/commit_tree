kexec: add the values related to buddy system for filtering free pages.

tAdd adds the values related to buddy system to vmcoreinfo data so that
makedumpfile (dump filtering command) can filter out all free pages with
the new logic.

It's faster than the current logic because it can distinguish free page
by analyzing page structure at the same time as filtering for other
unnecessary pages (e.g.  anonymous page).

OTOH, the current logic has to trace free_list to distinguish free pages
while analyzing page structure to filter out other unnecessary pages.

The new logic uses the fact that buddy page is marked by _mapcount ==
PAGE_BUDDY_MAPCOUNT_VALUE.  But, _mapcount shares its memory with other
fields for SLAB/SLUB when PG_slab is set, so we need to check if PG_slab
is set or not before looking up _mapcount value.  And we can get the
order of buddy system from private field.  To sum it up, the values
below are required for this logic.

Required values:
  - OFFSET(page._mapcount)
  - OFFSET(page.private)
  - NUMBER(PG_slab)
  - NUMBER(PAGE_BUDDY_MAPCOUNT_VALUE)

Changelog from v1 to v2:
1. remove SIZE(pageflags)
  The new logic was changed after I sent v1 patch.
  Accordingly, SIZE(pageflags) has been unnecessary for makedumpfile.

What's makedumpfile:
  makedumpfile creates a small dumpfile by excluding unnecessary pages
  for the analysis. To distinguish unnecessary pages, makedumpfile gets
  the vmcoreinfo data which has the minimum debugging information only
  for dump filtering.
