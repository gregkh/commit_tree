HID: Support Jess/Saitek Color Rumble Pad

Add support for another gamepad to the hid-pl driver.  The "color rumble pad
P580" marketed using the "Saitek" brand in Germany, and using a USB Vendor ID
attributed to "Jess" seems to be electronically identical to the 4-field
variant of the "Green Asia" gamepad.

The pad has been tested to support rumble strengths up to 255, not just 127.
