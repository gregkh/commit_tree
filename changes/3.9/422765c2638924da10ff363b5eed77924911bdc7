block: Remove should_sort judgement when flush blk_plug

In commit 975927b942c932,it add blk_rq_pos to sort rq when flushing.
Although this commit was used for the situation which blk_plug handled
multi devices on the same time like md device.
I think there must be some situations like this but only single
device.
So remove the should_sort judgement.
Because the parameter should_sort is only for this purpose,it can delete
should_sort from blk_plug.
