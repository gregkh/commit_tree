gpio/vt8500: memory cleanup missing

This driver is missing a .remove callback, and the fail path on
probe is incomplete.

If an error occurs in vt8500_add_chips, gpio_base is not unmapped.
The driver is also ignoring the return value from this function so
if a chip fails to register it completes as successful.

Replaced pr_err with dev_err in vt8500_add_chips since the device is
available.

There is also no .remove callback defined so the function is added.
