s390/3270: introduce device notifier

Add a notifier to create / destroy the device nodes for the tty view
and the fullscreen view. Only device nodes for online devices are
created and the device names will follow the convention as outlined
in Documentation/devices.txt: 3270/tty<x> for the tty nodes,
3270/tub<x> for hte fullscreen nodes and 3270/tub for the fullscreen
control node.
