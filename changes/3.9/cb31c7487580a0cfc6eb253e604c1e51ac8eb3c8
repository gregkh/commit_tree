[media] budget-av: only use t_state if initialized

Building budget-av.o triggers this GCC warning:
    In file included from drivers/media/pci/ttpci/budget-av.c:44:0:
    drivers/media/dvb-frontends/tda8261_cfg.h: In function ‘tda8261_get_bandwidth’:
    drivers/media/dvb-frontends/tda8261_cfg.h:68:21: warning: ‘t_state.bandwidth’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wuninitialized]
Move the printk() that uses t_state.bandwith to the location where it
should be initialized to fix this.
