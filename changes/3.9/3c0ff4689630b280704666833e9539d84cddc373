mm: numa: handle side-effects in count_vm_numa_events() for !CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING

The current definitions for count_vm_numa_events() is wrong for
!CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING as the following would miss the side-effect.

	count_vm_numa_events(NUMA_FOO, bar++);

There are no such users of count_vm_numa_events() but this patch fixes
it as it is a potential pitfall.  Ideally both would be converted to
static inline but NUMA_PTE_UPDATES is not defined if
!CONFIG_NUMA_BALANCING and creating dummy constants just to have a
static inline would be similarly clumsy.
