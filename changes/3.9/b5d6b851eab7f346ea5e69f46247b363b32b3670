Input: ALPS - rework detection sequence

If the E6 report test passes, get the E7 and EC reports right away and
then try to match an entry in the table.

Pass in the alps_data struct, so that the detection code will be able to
set operating parameters based on information found during detection.

Change the version (psmouse->model) to report the protocol version only,
in preparation for supporting models that do not show up in the ID table.
