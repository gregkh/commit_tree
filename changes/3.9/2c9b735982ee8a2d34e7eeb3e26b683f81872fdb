mac80211: add ieee80211_vif_change_bandwidth

For HT and VHT the current bandwidth can change,
add the function ieee80211_vif_change_bandwidth()
to take care of this. It returns a failure if the
new bandwidth isn't compatible with the existing
channel context, the caller has to handle that.
When it happens, also inform the driver that the
bandwidth changed for this virtual interface (no
drivers would actually care today though.)

Changing to/from HT/VHT isn't allowed though.
