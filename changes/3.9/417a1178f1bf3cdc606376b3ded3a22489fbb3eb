ASoC: dma-sh7760: Fix compile error

The dma-sh7760 currently fails with the following compile error:
	sound/soc/sh/dma-sh7760.c:346:2: error: unknown field 'pcm_ops' specified in initializer
	sound/soc/sh/dma-sh7760.c:346:2: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
	sound/soc/sh/dma-sh7760.c:347:2: error: unknown field 'pcm_new' specified in initializer
	sound/soc/sh/dma-sh7760.c:347:2: warning: initialization makes integer from pointer without a cast
	sound/soc/sh/dma-sh7760.c:348:2: error: unknown field 'pcm_free' specified in initializer
	sound/soc/sh/dma-sh7760.c:348:2: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type
	sound/soc/sh/dma-sh7760.c: In function 'sh7760_soc_platform_probe':
	sound/soc/sh/dma-sh7760.c:353:2: warning: passing argument 2 of 'snd_soc_register_platform' from incompatible pointer type
	include/sound/soc.h:368:5: note: expected 'struct snd_soc_platform_driver *' but argument is of type 'struct snd_soc_platform *'

This is due the misnaming of the snd_soc_platform_driver type name and 'ops'
field. The issue was introduced in commit f0fba2a("ASoC: multi-component - ASoC
Multi-Component Support").
