powerpc: Enable ARCH_USE_BUILTIN_BSWAP

By using the compiler intrinsics instead of hand-crafted opaque inline
assembler for byte-swapping, we let the compiler see what's actually
happening and it gets to use lwbrx/stwbrx instructions instead of a
normal load/store coupled with a sequence of rlwimi instructions to
move bits around.

Compiled-tested only. It gave a code size reduction of almost 4% for
ext2, and more like 2.5% for ext3/ext4.
