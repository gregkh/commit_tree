drm/i915: Kill i915_gem_execbuffer_wait_for_flips()

As per Chris Wilson's suggestion make
i915_gem_execbuffer_wait_for_flips() go away.

This was used to stall the GPU ring while there are pending
page flips involving the relevant BO. Ie. while the BO is still
being scanned out by the display controller.

The recommended alternative is to use the page flip events to
wait for the page flips to fully complete before reusing the BO
of the old front buffer. Or use more buffers.

reorder patches.]
