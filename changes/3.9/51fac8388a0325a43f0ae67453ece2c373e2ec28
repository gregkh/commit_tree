ACPI: Remove useless type argument of driver .remove() operation

The second argument of ACPI driver .remove() operation is only used
by the ACPI processor driver and the value passed to that driver
through it is always available from the given struct acpi_device
object's removal_type field.  For this reason, the second ACPI driver
.remove() argument is in fact useless, so drop it.
