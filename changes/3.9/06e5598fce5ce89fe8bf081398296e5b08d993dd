drm/i915: Move GSM mapping into dev_priv

This removes an unused field from the AGP structure and moves it into
the dev_priv structure (with a slightly better name). This builds upon
the kill-agp series already merged.

GSM is a well defined term in the bspec:
GSM: Graphics Stolen Memory

GTT stolen space is defined for storage of the GFX GTT entries in
physical memory. IA can not access GSM directly , it can only access via
GTTMMADR. GT can access GSM directly or through GTTMMADR.

This is not the entire stolen space.
