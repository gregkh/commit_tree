libata: identify and init ZPODD devices

The ODD can be enabled for ZPODD if the following three conditions are
satisfied:
1 The ODD supports device attention;
2 The platform can runtime power off the ODD through ACPI;
3 The ODD is either slot type or drawer type.
For such ODDs, zpodd_init is called and a new structure is allocated for
it to store ZPODD related stuffs.

And the zpodd_dev_enabled function is used to test if ZPODD is currently
enabled for this ODD.

A new config CONFIG_SATA_ZPODD is added to selectively build ZPODD code.
