userns: Allow any uid or gid mappings that don't overlap.

When I initially wrote the code for /proc/<pid>/uid_map.  I was lazy
and avoided duplicate mappings by the simple expedient of ensuring the
first number in a new extent was greater than any number in the
previous extent.

Unfortunately that precludes a number of valid mappings, and someone
noticed and complained.  So use a simple check to ensure that ranges
in the mapping extents don't overlap.
