hwmon: (pmbus) Use krealloc to allocate attribute memory

So far, attribute memory was allocated by pre-calculating the maximum possible
amount of attributes. Not only does this waste memory, it is also risky because
the calculation might be wrong. It also requires a lot of defines to specify
the maximum number of attributes per class.

Allocate attribute memory using krealloc() instead. That means we have to use
kfree(), since devm_krealloc() does not exist, but that is still less costly
and less risky than trying to predict the number of attributes at the beginning.
