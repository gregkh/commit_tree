async, kmod: warn on synchronous request_module() from async workers

Synchronous requet_module() from an async worker can lead to deadlock
because module init path may invoke async_synchronize_full().  The
async worker waits for request_module() to complete and the module
loading waits for the async task to finish.  This bug happened in the
block layer because of default elevator auto-loading.

Block layer has been updated not to do default elevator auto-loading
and it has been decided to disallow synchronous request_module() from
async workers.

Trigger WARN_ON_ONCE() on synchronous request_module() from async
workers.
