Btrfs: add a plugging callback to raid56 writes

Buffered writes and DIRECT_IO writes will often break up
big contiguous changes to the file into sub-stripe writes.

This adds a plugging callback to gather those smaller writes full stripe
writes.

Example on flash:

fio job to do 64K writes in batches of 3 (which makes a full stripe):

With plugging: 450MB/s
Without plugging: 220MB/s
