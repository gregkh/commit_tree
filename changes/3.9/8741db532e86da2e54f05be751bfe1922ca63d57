tracing/fgraph: Add max_graph_depth to limit function_graph depth

Add the file max_graph_depth to the debug tracing directory that lets
the user define the depth of the function graph.

A very useful operation is to set the depth to 1. Then it traces only
the first function that is called when entering the kernel. This can
be used to determine what system operations interrupt a process.

For example, to work on NOHZ processes (single tasks running without
a timer tick), if any interrupt goes off and preempts that task, this
code will show it happening.

  # cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
  # echo 1 > max_graph_depth
  # echo function_graph > current_tracer
  # cat per_cpu/cpu/<cpu-of-process>/trace
