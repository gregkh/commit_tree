uprobes/perf: Teach trace_uprobe/perf code to track the active perf_event's

Introduce "struct trace_uprobe_filter" which records the "active"
perf_event's attached to ftrace_event_call. For the start we simply
use list_head, we can optimize this later if needed. For example, we
do not really need to record an event with ->parent != NULL, we can
rely on parent->child_list. And we can certainly do some optimizations
for the case when 2 events have the same ->tp_target or tp_target->mm.

Change trace_uprobe_register() to process TRACE_REG_PERF_OPEN/CLOSE
and add/del this perf_event to the list.

We can probably avoid any locking, but lets start with the "obvioulsy
correct" trace_uprobe_filter->rwlock which protects everything.
