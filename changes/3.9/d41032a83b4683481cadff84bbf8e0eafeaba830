tracing: Fix unsigned int compare of zero in recursion check

Dan's smatch found a compare bug with the result of the
trace_test_and_set_recursion() and comparing to less than
zero. If the function fails, it returns -1, but was saved in
an unsigned int, which will never be less than zero and will
ignore the result of the test if a recursion did happen.

Luckily this is the last of the recursion tests, as the
infrastructure of ftrace would catch recursions before it
got here, except for some few exceptions.
