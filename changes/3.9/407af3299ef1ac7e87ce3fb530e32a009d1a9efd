bridge: Add netlink interface to configure vlans on bridge ports

Add a netlink interface to add and remove vlan configuration on bridge port.
The interface uses the RTM_SETLINK message and encodes the vlan
configuration inside the IFLA_AF_SPEC.  It is possble to include multiple
vlans to either add or remove in a single message.
