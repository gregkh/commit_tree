w1: Convert to devm_ioremap_resource()

Convert all uses of devm_request_and_ioremap() to the newly introduced
devm_ioremap_resource() which provides more consistent error handling.

devm_ioremap_resource() provides its own error messages so all explicit
error messages can be removed from the failure code paths.
