drm/i915: Preserve the FDI line reversal override bit on CPT

The FDI link has supported link reversal to make the PCB layout
engineer's life easier for quite a while and we have always presered
this bit as we programmed FDI_RX_CTL with a read/modify/write sequence.

We're trying to take a bit more control over what the BIOS leaves in
various register and with the introduction of DDI, started to program
FDI_RX_CTL fully.

There's a fused bit to indicate DMI link reversal and FDI defaults to
mirroring that configuration. We have a bit to override that behaviour
that we need to preserve from the BIOS.
