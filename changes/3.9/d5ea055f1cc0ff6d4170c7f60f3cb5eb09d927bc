ceph: Enable building when user namespaces are enabled.

Now that conversions happen from kuids and kgids when generating ceph
messages and conversion happen to kuids and kgids after receiving
celph messages, and all intermediate data structures store uids and
gids as type kuid_t and kgid_t it is safe to enable ceph with
user namespace support enabled.
