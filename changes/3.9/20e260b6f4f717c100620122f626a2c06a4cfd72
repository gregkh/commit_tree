ARM: 7632/1: spinlock: avoid exclusive accesses on unlock() path

When unlocking a spinlock, all we need to do is increment the owner
field of the lock. Since only one CPU can be performing an unlock()
operation for a given lock, this doesn't need to be exclusive.

This patch simplifies arch_spin_unlock to use non-exclusive accesses
when updating the owner field of the lock.
