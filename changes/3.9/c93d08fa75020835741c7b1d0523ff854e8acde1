leds-lp55xx: add new common driver for lp5521/5523

 This patch supports basic common driver code for LP5521, LP5523/55231 devices.

 ( Driver Structure Data )

 lp55xx_led and lp55xx_chip
 In lp55xx common driver, two different data structure is used.
 o lp55xx_led
   control multi output LED channels such as led current, channel index.
 o lp55xx_chip
   general chip control such like the I2C and platform data.

 For example, LP5521 has maximum 3 LED channels.
 LP5523/55231 has 9 output channels.

 lp55xx_chip for LP5521 ... lp55xx_led #1
                            lp55xx_led #2
                            lp55xx_led #3

 lp55xx_chip for LP5523 ... lp55xx_led #1
                            lp55xx_led #2
                            .
                            .
                            lp55xx_led #9

 ( Platform Data )

 LP5521 and LP5523/55231 have own specific platform data.
 However, this data can be handled with just one platform data structure.
 The lp55xx platform data is declared in the header.
 This structure is derived from leds-lp5521.h and leds-lp5523.h
