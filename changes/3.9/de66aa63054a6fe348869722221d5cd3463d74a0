Bluetooth: Store UUIDs in the same order that they were added

We should be encoding UUIDs to the EIR data in the same order that they
were added to the kernel, i.e. each UUID should be added to the end of
the UUIDs list. This patch fixes the issue by using list_add_tail
instead of list_add for storing the UUIDs.
