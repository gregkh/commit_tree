MD RAID5: Avoid accessing gendisk or queue structs when not available

MD RAID5:  Fix kernel oops when RAID4/5/6 is used via device-mapper

Commit a9add5d (v3.8-rc1) added blktrace calls to the RAID4/5/6 driver.
However, when device-mapper is used to create RAID4/5/6 arrays, the
mddev->gendisk and mddev->queue fields are not setup.  Therefore, calling
things like trace_block_bio_remap will cause a kernel oops.  This patch
conditionalizes those calls on whether the proper fields exist to make
the calls.  (Device-mapper will call trace_block_bio_remap on its own.)

This patch is suitable for the 3.8.y stable kernel.
