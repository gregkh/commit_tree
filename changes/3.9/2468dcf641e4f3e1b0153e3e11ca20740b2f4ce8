powerpc: Add support for context switching the TAR register

This patch adds support for enabling and context switching the Target
Address Register in Power8. The TAR is a new special purpose register
that can be used for computed branches with the bctar[l] (branch
conditional to TAR) instruction in the same manner as the count and link
registers.
