staging: comedi: addi_apci_3501: analog output resolution is fixed

The analog outputs of this board are always 14-bit. Remove this
information from the boardinfo and just set the 'maxdata' directly
in the subdevice init. Initialize with a hex value as that is more
standard in the comedi drivers.

Since devpriv->s_EeParameters.i_AoMaxdata is not longer being used,
don't bother initializing it.
