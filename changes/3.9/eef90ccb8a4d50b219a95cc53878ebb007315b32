drm/i915: Use the reloc.handle as an index into the execbuffer array

Using copywinwin10 as an example that is dependent upon emitting a lot
of relocations (2 per operation), we see improvements of:

c2d/gm45: 618000.0/sec to 623000.0/sec.
i3-330m: 748000.0/sec to 789000.0/sec.

(measured relative to a baseline with neither optimisations applied).
