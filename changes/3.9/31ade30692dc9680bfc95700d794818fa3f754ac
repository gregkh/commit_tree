timekeeping: Add persistent_clock_exist flag

In current kernel, there are several places which need to check
whether there is a persistent clock for the platform. Current check
is done by calling the read_persistent_clock() and validating its
return value.

So one optimization is to do the check only once in timekeeping_init(),
and use a flag persistent_clock_exist to record it.

v2: Add a has_persistent_clock() helper function, as suggested by John.
