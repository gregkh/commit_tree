ARM: nomadik: add FSMC NAND

This adds the FSMC NAND driver and flash partitions to the Nomadik
device tree.

The only compatible string accepted by this driver is currently
"st,spear600-fsmc-nand" which is inappropriate for this system, so
this patch adds the compatible value "stericsson,fsmc-nand" as
well.
