e1000e: Acquire/release semaphore when writing each EEPROM page

When data blocks are written to the EEPROM, the HW/SW/FW semaphore must be
held for the duration.  With large data blocks on 80003es2lan, 82571 and
82572, this can take too long and cause the firmware to take ownership of
the semaphore and consequently ownership of writes to the EEPROM.
Instead, acquire and release the semaphore for each page of the block
written.
