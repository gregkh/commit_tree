mtd: omap-nand: pass device_node in platform data

Pass an optional device_node pointer in the platform data, which in turn
will be put into a mtd_part_parser_data. This way, code that sets up the
platform devices can pass along the node from DT so that the partitions
can be parsed.

For non-DT boards, this change has no effect.
