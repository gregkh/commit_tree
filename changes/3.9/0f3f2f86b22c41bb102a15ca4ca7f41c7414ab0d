Drivers: hv: Bind all vmbbus interrupts to the boot CPU

The default interrupt delivery model in Linux does not support the Hyper-V
vmbus delivery model when the guest is configured with multiple VCPUs. I have
sent a patch to address this - delivering the vmbus interrupt on a separate
IDT vector. Until this patch is applied, bind all vmbus interrupts to the boot
CPU.
