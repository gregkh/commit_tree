ALSA: hda - Synchronize the power state at the end of codec init

Put the power state synchronization at the end of the parsing of
codec.  This is necessary when the power filter is changed during the
codec probe.  Since the first power-up sequence is performed without
the special filter, all widgets are supposed to be ON at this point.
