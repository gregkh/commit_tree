extcon: arizona: Support HPDET based accessory identification

The accessory detection functionality in Arizona devices is flexible and
supports several system designs in addition to the default one implemented
by the existing driver. One such design uses the HPDET feature to determine
what kind of accessory is present by comparing measurements taken with the
two headphone grounds available on the device, implement that if selected
by platform data.
