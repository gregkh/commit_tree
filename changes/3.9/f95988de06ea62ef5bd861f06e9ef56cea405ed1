ACPI / scan: Treat power resources in a special way

Commit 805d410 (ACPI: Separate adding ACPI device objects from
probing ACPI drivers) introduced an ACPI power resources management
regression, because it didn't ensure that the power resources
driver bind to the struct acpi_device objects corresponding
to power resources as soon as they were created.  As a result,
ACPI power management routines may attempt to access power resource
objects before they are ready to use.

To fix this problem, tell the acpi_add_single_object() in
acpi_bus_check_add() to probe the driver for objects of type
ACPI_BUS_TYPE_POWER.  This fix has been verified to work on
HP nx6325 where the problem was first observed.
