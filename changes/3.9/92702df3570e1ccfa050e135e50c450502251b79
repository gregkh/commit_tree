ARM: OMAP4: PM: fix PM regression introduced by recent clock cleanup

Commit 17b7e7d33530e2bbd3bdc90f4db09b91cfdde2bb ("ARM: OMAP4:
clock/hwmod data: start to remove some IP block control "clocks"")
introduced a regression preventing the L3INIT clockdomain of OMAP4
systems from entering idle.  This in turn prevented these systems from
entering full chip clock-stop.

The regression was caused by the incorrect removal of a so-called
"optional functional clock" from the OMAP4 clock data.  This wasn't
caught for two reasons.  First, I missed the retention entry failure
in the branch test logs:

Second, the integration data for the OCP2SCP PHY IP block, added by
commit 0c6688753f9912c6a7013549ec31c8844020bbc1 ("ARM: OMAP4: hwmod
data: add remaining USB-related IP blocks"), should have associated this
clock with the IP block, but did not.

Fix by adding back the so-called "optional" functional clock to the
clock data, and by linking that clock to the OCP2SCP PHY IP block
integration hwmod data.
