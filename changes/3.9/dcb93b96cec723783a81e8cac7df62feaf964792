xen/stub: driver for memory hotplug

This patch create a file (xen-stub.c) for Xen stub drivers.
Xen stub drivers are used to reserve space for Xen drivers, i.e.
memory hotplug and cpu hotplug, and to block native drivers loaded,
so that real Xen drivers can be modular and loaded on demand.

This patch is specific for Xen memory hotplug (other Xen logic
can add stub drivers on their own). The xen stub driver will
occupied earlier via subsys_initcall (than native memory hotplug
driver via module_init and so blocking native). Later real Xen
memory hotplug logic will unregister the stub driver and register
itself to take effect on demand.
