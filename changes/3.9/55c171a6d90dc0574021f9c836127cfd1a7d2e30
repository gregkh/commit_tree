KVM: s390: Handle hosts not supporting s390-virtio.

Running under a kvm host does not necessarily imply the presence of
a page mapped above the main memory with the virtio information;
however, the code includes a hard coded access to that page.

Instead, check for the presence of the page and exit gracefully
before we hit an addressing exception if it does not exist.
