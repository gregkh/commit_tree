drivers/tty/serial: extern function which for release resource, need check pointer, before free it

  for extern function uart_remove_one_port:
    need check pointer whether be NULL, before the main work.
    just like what the other extern function uart_add_one_port has done.
    uart_add_one_port and uart_remove_one_port are pair

  information:
    for the callers (such as drivers/tty/serial/jsm: jsm_tty.c, jsm_driver.c)
    they realy assume that:
      they still can call uart_remove_one_port, after uart_add_one_port failed
    we (as an extern function), have to understand it (just like kfree).
