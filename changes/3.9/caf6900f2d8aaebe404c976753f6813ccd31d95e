KVM: MMU: lazily drop large spte

Currently, kvm zaps the large spte if write-protected is needed, the later
read can fault on that spte. Actually, we can make the large spte readonly
instead of making them not present, the page fault caused by read access can
be avoided

The idea is from Avi:
| As I mentioned before, write-protecting a large spte is a good idea,
| since it moves some work from protect-time to fault-time, so it reduces
| jitter.  This removes the need for the return value.
