staging: comedi: addi_apci_3501: cleanup the digital output subdevice

The board supported by this driver has 2 digital outputs. Remove the
conditional and always init the subdevice.

Also, move the subdevice insn_bits function pointer as well as the
n_chan out of the boardinfo and use them to initialize the subdevice
directly.

Since devpriv->s_EeParameters for the digital output subdevice are no
longer being used, remove initialization of them also.

Copy the apci3501_do_insn_bits() function from hwrdv_apci3501.c into
the main driver file.

Fix the subdev_flags for the subdevice. The only required flag is
SDF_WRITEABLE. The SDF_GROUND and SDF_COMMON flags only have meaning
for analog subdevices and the SDF_READABLE flag is not required.

Fix the maxdata for the subdevice. Digital outputs can only be 1 or 0.

Remove the len_chanlist initialization, it only has meaning for subdevices
that support commands.

Remove the io_bits initialization, it only has meaning for digital i/o
subdevices that have configurable outputs.
