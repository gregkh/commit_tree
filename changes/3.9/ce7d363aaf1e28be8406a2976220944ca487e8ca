md/raid5: schedule_construction should abort if nothing to do.

Since commit 1ed850f356a0a422013846b5291acff08815008b
    md/raid5: make sure to_read and to_write never go negative.

It has been possible for handle_stripe_dirtying to be called
when there isn't actually any work to do.
It then calls schedule_reconstruction() which will set R5_LOCKED
on the parity block(s) even when nothing else is happening.
This then causes problems in do_release_stripe().

So add checks to schedule_reconstruction() so that if it doesn't
find anything to do, it just aborts.

This bug was introduced in v3.7, so the patch is suitable
for -stable kernels since then.
