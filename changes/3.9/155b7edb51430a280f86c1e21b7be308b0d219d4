xen-blkfront: switch from llist to list

The git commit f84adf4921ae3115502f44ff467b04bf2f88cf04
(xen-blkfront: drop the use of llist_for_each_entry_safe)

was a stop-gate to fix a GCC4.1 bug. The appropiate way
is to actually use an list instead of using an llist.

As such this patch replaces the usage of llist with an
list.

Since we always manipulate the list while holding the io_lock, there's
no need for additional locking (llist used previously is safe to use
concurrently without additional locking).
