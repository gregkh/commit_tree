ARM: 7653/2: do not scale loops_per_jiffy when using a constant delay clock

When udelay() is implemented using an architected timer, it is wrong
to scale loops_per_jiffy when changing the CPU clock frequency since
the timer clock remains constant.

The lpj should probably become an implementation detail relevant to
the CPU loop based delay routine only and more confined to it. In the
mean time this is the minimal fix needed to have expected delays with
the timer based implementation when cpufreq is also in use.
