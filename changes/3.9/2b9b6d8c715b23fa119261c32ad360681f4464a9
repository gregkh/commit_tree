x86: Require MOVBE feature in cpuid when we use it

Add MOVBE to asm/required-features.h so we check for it during startup
and don't bother checking for it later.

CONFIG_MATOM is used because it corresponds to -march=atom in the
Makefiles.  If the rules get more complicated it may be necessary to
make this an explicit Kconfig option which uses -mmovbe/-mno-movbe to
control the use of this instruction explicitly.
