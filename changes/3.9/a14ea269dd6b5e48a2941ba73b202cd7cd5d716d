rbd: turn off interrupts for open/remove locking

This commit:
    bc7a62ee5 rbd: prevent open for image being removed
added checking for removing rbd before allowing an open, and used
the same request spinlock for protecting that and updating the open
count as is used for the request queue.

However it used the non-irq protected version of the spinlocks.
Fix that.
