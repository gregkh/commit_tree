KVM: VMX: fix emulation of invalid guest state.

Currently when emulation of invalid guest state is enable
(emulate_invalid_guest_state=1) segment registers are still fixed for
entry to vm86 mode some times. Segment register fixing is avoided in
enter_rmode(), but vmx_set_segment() still does it unconditionally.
The patch fixes it.
