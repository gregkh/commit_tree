ACPI / platform: create LPSS clocks if Lynxpoint devices are found during scan

Intel Lynxpoint LPSS peripheral drivers depend on LPSS clock tree being
created in order to function properly. The clock tree is exposed as a
platform driver that binds to a device named 'clk-lpt'.

To support this we modify the acpi_create_platform_device() to take one
additional parameter called flags. This is passed from
acpi_platform_device_ids[] array when acpi_create_platform_device() is
called.

We then introduce a new flag ACPI_PLATFORM_CLK which is used to tell
acpi_create_platform_device() to create the platform clocks as well.

Finally we set the ACPI_PLATFORM_CLK flags for all the Lynxpoint LPSS
devices and make sure that when this flag is set we create the
corresponding clock tree platform device.
