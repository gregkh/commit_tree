efivarfs: Validate filenames much more aggressively

The only thing that efivarfs does to enforce a valid filename is
ensure that the name isn't too short. We need to strongly sanitise any
filenames, not least because variable creation is delayed until
efivarfs_file_write(), which means we can't rely on the firmware to
inform us of an invalid name, because if the file is never written to
we'll never know it's invalid.

Perform a couple of steps before agreeing to create a new file,

  * hex_to_bin() returns a value indicating whether or not it was able
    to convert its arguments to a binary representation - we should
    check it.

  * Ensure that the GUID portion of the filename is the correct length
    and format.

  * The variable name portion of the filename needs to be at least one
    character in size.
