    drm/i915/hdmi: Read the HPD status before trying to read the EDID

They reliably cause HDMI to not be detected on some systems (like my
ivb or the bug reporters gm45). To fix up the very slow unplug issues
we might want to fire up a 2nd detect cycle a few hundred ms after
each hotplug. But for now at least make displays work again.

I somewhat suspect that this is confined to HDMI connectors, since all
the machines I have with DP+ outputs work correctly.
