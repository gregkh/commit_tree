KVM: s390: Add support for channel I/O instructions.

Add a new capability, KVM_CAP_S390_CSS_SUPPORT, which will pass
intercepts for channel I/O instructions to userspace. Only I/O
instructions interacting with I/O interrupts need to be handled
in-kernel:

- TEST PENDING INTERRUPTION (tpi) dequeues and stores pending
  interrupts entirely in-kernel.
- TEST SUBCHANNEL (tsch) dequeues pending interrupts in-kernel
  and exits via KVM_EXIT_S390_TSCH to userspace for subchannel-
  related processing.
