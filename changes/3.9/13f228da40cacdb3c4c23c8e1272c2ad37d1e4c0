gianfar: Remove wrong buffer size conditioning to VLAN h/w offload

The controller's ref manual states clearly that when the hw Rx vlan
offload feature is enabled, meaning that the VLEX bit from RCTRL is
correctly enabled, then the hw performs automatic VLAN tag extraction
and deletion from the ethernet frames. So there's no point in trying to
increase the rx buff size when rxvlan is on, as the frame is actually
smaller.
And the Tx vlan hw accel feature (VLINS) has nothing to do with rx buff
size computation.
