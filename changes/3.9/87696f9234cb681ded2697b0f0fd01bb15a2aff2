net: Export __netdev_pick_tx so that it can be used in modules

When testing with FCoE enabled we discovered that I had not exported
__netdev_pick_tx.  As a result ixgbe doesn't build with the RFC patches
applied because ixgbe_select_queue was calling the function.  This change
corrects that build issue by correctly exporting __netdev_pick_tx so it
can be used by modules.
