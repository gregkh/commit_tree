extcon: arizona: Support direct microphone measurement via HPDET

With some GPIO control it is possible to detect microphones in a wider
range of configurations by directly measuring the microphone impedance
when the HPDET method cannot distinguish between the behaviour of the
two grounds. Allow a GPIO to be provided in platform data and use it to
implement this behaviour.
