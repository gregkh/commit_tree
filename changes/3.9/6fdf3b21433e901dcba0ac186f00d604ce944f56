Drivers: hv: Implement routines for read side signaling optimization

Implement functions that will support read-side signaling optimization.
By having the reader indicate the start of the "read" operation and the
"end" of the read operation we can more efficiently handle the signaling
protocol: while the read is in progress, there is no need for the "writer"
to signal the "reader" as new items are put on the read queue.
