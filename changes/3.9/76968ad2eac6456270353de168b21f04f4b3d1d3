sparc64: Fix huge PMD to PTE translation for sun4u in TLB miss handler.

When we set the sun4u version of the PTE execute bit, it's:

	or	REG, _PAGE_EXEC_4U, REG

_PAGE_EXEC_4U is 0x1000, unfortunately the immedate field of the
'or' instruction is a signed 13-bit value.  So the above actually
assembles into:

	or	REG, -4096, REG

completely corrupting the final PTE value.

Set it with a:

	sethi	%hi(_PAGE_EXEC_4U), TMP
	or	REG, TMP, REG

sequence instead.

This fixes "git gc" crashes on sun4u machines.
