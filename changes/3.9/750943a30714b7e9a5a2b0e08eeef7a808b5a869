ima: remove enforce checking duplication

Based on the IMA appraisal policy, files are appraised.  For those
files appraised, the IMA hooks return the integrity appraisal result,
assuming IMA-appraisal is in enforcing mode.  This patch combines
both of these criteria (in policy and enforcing file integrity),
removing the checking duplication.

Changelog v1:
- Update hook comments
