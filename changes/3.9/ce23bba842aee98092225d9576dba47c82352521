block: fix synchronization and limit check in blk_alloc_devt()

idr allocation in blk_alloc_devt() wasn't synchronized against lookup
and removal, and its limit check was off by one - 1 << MINORBITS is
the number of minors allowed, not the maximum allowed minor.

Add locking and rename MAX_EXT_DEVT to NR_EXT_DEVT and fix limit
checking.
