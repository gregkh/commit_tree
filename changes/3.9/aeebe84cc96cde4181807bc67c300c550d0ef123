x86, mm: Use big page size for small memory range

We could map small range in the middle of big range at first, so should use
big page size at first to avoid using small page size to break down page table.

Only can set big page bit when that range has ram area around it.

-v2: fix 32bit boundary checking. We can not count ram above max_low_pfn
	for 32 bit.
