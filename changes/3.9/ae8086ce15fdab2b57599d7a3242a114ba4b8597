cpuset: introduce cpuset_for_each_child()

Instead of iterating cgroup->children directly, introduce and use
cpuset_for_each_child() which wraps cgroup_for_each_child() and
performs online check.  As it uses the generic iterator, it requires
RCU read locking too.

As cpuset is currently protected by cgroup_mutex, non-online cpusets
aren't visible to all the iterations and this patch currently doesn't
make any functional difference.  This will be used to de-couple cpuset
locking from cgroup core.
