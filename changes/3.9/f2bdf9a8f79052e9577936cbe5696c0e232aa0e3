Btrfs: make sure NODATACOW also gets NODATASUM set

A user reported hitting the BUG_ON() in btrfs_finished_ordered_io() where we had
csums on a NOCOW extent.  This can happen if we have NODATACOW set but not
NODATASUM set, which can happen in two cases, either we mount with -o nodatacow
and then write into preallocated space, or chattr +C a directory and move a file
into that directory.  Liu has fixed the move case in a different place, but this
fixes the mount -o nodatacow case.  Thanks,
