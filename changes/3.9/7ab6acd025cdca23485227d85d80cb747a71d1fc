brcmfmac: Remove sleep on del_station.

Currently there is a sleep after disconnect on del_station. This
timeout is not needed (anymore) and is causing problems with p2p
setup, because remote side disconnects then supplicant will do
del_station and while it waits the 400ms remote side will already
reconnect and that is something supplicant cant handle.
