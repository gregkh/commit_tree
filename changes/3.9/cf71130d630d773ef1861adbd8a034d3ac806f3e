parisc: disable -mlong-calls compiler option for kernel modules

CONFIG_MLONGCALLS was introduced in commit
ec758f98328da3eb933a25dc7a2eed01ef44d849 to overcome linker issues when linking
huge linux kernels, e.g. with many modules linked in.

But in the kernel module loader there is no support yet for the new relocation
types, which is why modules built with -mlong-calls can't be loaded.
Furthermore, for modules long calls are not really necessary, since we already
use stub sections which resolve long distance calls.

So, let's just disable this compiler option when compiling kernel modules.
