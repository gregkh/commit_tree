x86, mm: Add global page_size_mask and probe one time only

Now we pass around use_gbpages and use_pse for calculating page table size,
Later we will need to call init_memory_mapping for every ram range one by one,
that mean those calculation will be done several times.

Those information are the same for all ram range and could be stored in
page_size_mask and could be probed it one time only.

Move that probing code out of init_memory_mapping into separated function
probe_page_size_mask(), and call it before all init_memory_mapping.
