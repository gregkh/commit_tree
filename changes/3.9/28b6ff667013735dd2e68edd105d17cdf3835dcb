|    x86: Fix S4 regression
|
|    Commit 4b239f458 ("x86-64, mm: Put early page table high") causes a S4
|    regression since 2.6.39, namely the machine reboots occasionally at S4
|    resume.  It doesn't happen always, overall rate is about 1/20.  But,
|    like other bugs, once when this happens, it continues to happen.
|
|    This patch fixes the problem by essentially reverting the memory
|    assignment in the older way.

Have some page table around 512M again, that will prevent kdump to find 512M
under 768M.

We need revert that reverting, so we could put page table high again for 64bit.

Takashi agreed that S4 regression could be something else.
