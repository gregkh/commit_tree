i915: intel_set_mode: Reduce stack allocation from 500 bytes to 2 pointers

smatch warning:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_display.c:7019 intel_set_mode() warn: function puts
500 bytes on stack

Refactor so that saved_mode and saved_hwmode are dynamically allocated as opposed
to being automatic variables. 500 bytes seems like it could run the potential for blowing
the kernel stack.
