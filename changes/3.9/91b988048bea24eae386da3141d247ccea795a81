perf tools: Fix calloc argument ordering

A sweep of the kernel for regex "kcalloc(sizeof" turned up 2 reversed
args, fixed in commit d3d09e18203dba16a9dbdb2b4cc673d90748cdd1 ("EDAC:
Fix kcalloc argument order") and also fixed in the networking commit
a1b1add07fa794974573d93483d68e373edfe7bd ("gro: Fix kcalloc argument
order").

I know that was the regex used, because on seeing the 1st of these
changes, I wondered "how many other instances of this are there" and I
happened to just use "calloc(sizeof" as a regex and it in turn found
these additional reversed args instances in the perf code.

In the kcalloc cases, the changes are cosmetic, since the numbers are
simply multiplied.  I had no desire to go data mining in userspace to
see if the same thing held true there, however.
