ASoC: Samsung: set drvdata before adding secondary device

Currently, a new platform device is created for secondary device
by calling platform_device_register_resndata and then the drvdata
is set for this device.

The following patch has been added to driver core:
"driver core: fix possible missing of device probe".

This results in the added device getting probed immediately but
the drvdata for the secondary device is not yet set.
This patch removes the platform_device_register_resndata call and
instead calls platform_device_alloc, platform_set_drvdata and
platform_device_add which fixes the above issue.
