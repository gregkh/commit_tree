mm/fremap.c: fix possible oops on error path

The vm_flags introduced in 6d7825b10dbe ("mm/fremap.c: fix oops on error
path") is supposed to avoid a compiler warning about unitialized
vm_flags without changing the generated code.

However I am concerned that this is going to be very brittle, and fail
with some compiler versions. The failure could be either of:

- compiler could actually load vma->vm_flags before checking for the
  !vma condition, thus reintroducing the oops

- compiler could optimize out the !vma check, since the pointer just got
  dereferenced shortly before (so the compiler knows it can't be NULL!)

I propose reversing this part of the change and initializing vm_flags to 0
just to avoid the bogus uninitialized use warning.
