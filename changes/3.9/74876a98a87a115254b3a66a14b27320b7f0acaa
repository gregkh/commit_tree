printk: Wake up klogd using irq_work

klogd is woken up asynchronously from the tick in order
to do it safely.

However if printk is called when the tick is stopped, the reader
won't be woken up until the next interrupt, which might not fire
for a while. As a result, the user may miss some message.

To fix this, lets implement the printk tick using a lazy irq work.
This subsystem takes care of the timer tick state and can
fix up accordingly.
