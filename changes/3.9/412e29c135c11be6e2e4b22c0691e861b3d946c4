hwmon: (sht15) check GPIO directions

Without this patch, the SHT15 driver may fail silently with a
non-bidirectional data line and/or an input-only clock line.

This patch checks the return value of gpio_direction_* function calls
and returns the error code (if any) to the caller. If an error occurs in
the read work function (work_funct_t), we wake the queue up directly
without updating the data->state flag, to notice the waiter of the I/O
error.

The patch also makes minor cleanups: s/error_ret/unlock for some labels
and uses devm_gpio_request_one() for the clock line.
