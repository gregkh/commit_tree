x86, kexec: Replace ident_mapping_init and init_level4_page

Now ident_mapping_init is checking if pgd/pud is present for every 2M,
so several 2Ms are in same PUD, it will keep checking if pud is there
with same pud.

init_level4_page just does not check existing pgd/pud.

We could use generic mapping_init with different settings in info to
replace those two local grown version functions.
