ARC: [Review] Prevent incorrect syscall restarts

Per Al Viro's "signals for dummies" https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/6/366
there are 3 golden rules for (not) restarting syscalls:

"	What we need to guarantee is
* restarts do not happen on signals caught in interrupts or exceptions
* restarts do not happen on signals caught in sigreturn()
* restart should happen only once, even if we get through do_signal()
  many times."

ARC Port already handled #1, this patch fixes #2 and #3.

We use the additional state in pt_regs->orig_r8 to ckh if restarting
has already been done once.

Thanks to Al Viro for spotting this.
