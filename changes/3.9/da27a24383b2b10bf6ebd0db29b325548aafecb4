efivarfs: guid part of filenames are case-insensitive

It makes no sense to treat the following filenames as unique,

	VarName-abcdefab-abcd-abcd-abcd-abcdefabcdef
	VarName-ABCDEFAB-ABCD-ABCD-ABCD-ABCDEFABCDEF
	VarName-ABcDEfAB-ABcD-ABcD-ABcD-ABcDEfABcDEf
	VarName-aBcDEfAB-aBcD-aBcD-aBcD-aBcDEfaBcDEf
	... etc ...

since the guid will be converted into a binary representation, which
has no case.

Roll our own dentry operations so that we can treat the variable name
part of filenames ("VarName" in the above example) as case-sensitive,
but the guid portion as case-insensitive. That way, efivarfs will
refuse to create the above files if any one already exists.
