aerdrv: Enhanced AER logging

This patch will provide a more reliable and easy way for user-space
applications to have access to AER logs rather than reading them from the
message buffer. It also provides a way to notify user-space when an AER
event occurs.

The aer driver is updated to generate a trace event of function 'aer_event'
when a PCIe error is reported over the AER interface.  The trace event was
added to both the interrupt based aer path and the firmware first path.
