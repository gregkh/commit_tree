drm/nouveau: try to protect nbo->pin_refcount

... by moving the bo_pin/bo_unpin manipulation of the pin_refcount
under the protection of the ttm reservation lock. pin/unpin seems
to get called from all over the place, so atm this is completely racy.

After this patch there are only a few places in cleanup functions
left which access ->pin_refcount without locking. But I'm hoping that
those are safe and some other code invariant guarantees that this
won't blow up.

In any case, I only need to fix up pin/unpin to make ->pageflip work
safely, so let's keep it at that.

Add a comment to the header to explain the new locking rule.
