s390/pci: fix hotplug module init

Loading the pci hotplug module when no devices are present will fail
but unfortunately some hotplug callbacks stay registered to the pci
bus level. Fix this by not letting module loading fail when no pci
devices are present and provide proper {de}registration functions
for these callbacks.
