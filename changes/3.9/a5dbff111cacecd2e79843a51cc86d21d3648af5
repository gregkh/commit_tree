dma: dw_dmac: clear suspend bit during termination

The DMA transfer could not be established if previously it was paused and
terminated. In that case the channel's suspend bit remains set that prevents to
transfer anything until channel is resumed.

The patch adds the dwc_chan_resume() call instead of a plain flag assignment.
That clears the DWC_CFGL_CH_SUSP bit as well during termination.
