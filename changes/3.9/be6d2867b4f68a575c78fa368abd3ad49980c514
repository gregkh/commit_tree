PCI: acpiphp: Remove dead code for PCI host bridge hotplug

Commit 668192b678201d2fff27c "PCI: acpiphp: Move host bridge hotplug
to pci_root.c" has moved PCI host bridge hotplug logic from acpiphp
to pci_root, but there is still PCI host bridge hotplug related
dead code left in acpiphp. So remove those dead code.

Now companion ACPI devices are always created before corresponding
PCI devices. And the ACPI event handle_hotplug_event_bridge() will be
installed only if it has associated PCI device. So remove dead code to
handle bridge hot-adding in function handle_hotplug_event_bridge().
