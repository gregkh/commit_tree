nfsd: use proper net while reading "exports" file

Functuon "exports_open" is used for both "/proc/fs/nfs/exports" and
"/proc/fs/nfsd/exports" files.
Now NFSd filesystem is containerised, so proper net can be taken from
superblock for "/proc/fs/nfsd/exports" reader.
But for "/proc/fs/nfsd/exports" only current->nsproxy->net_ns can be used.
