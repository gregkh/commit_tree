ab8500_bm: Recharge condition not optimal for battery

Today the battery recharge is determined with a voltage threshold. This
voltage threshold is only valid when the battery is relaxed. In charging
algorithm the voltage read is the loaded battery voltage and no
compensation is done to get the relaxed voltage. When maintenance
charging is not selected, this makes the recharging condition to almost
immediately activate when there is a discharge present on the battery.

Depending on which vendor the battery comes from this behavior can wear
out the battery much faster than normal.

The fuelgauge driver is responsible to monitor the actual battery
capacity and is able to estimate the remaining capacity. It is better to
use the remaining capacity as a limit to determine when battery should
be recharged.
