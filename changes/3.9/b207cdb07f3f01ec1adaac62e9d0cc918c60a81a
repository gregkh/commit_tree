mac80211: add vif debugfs driver callbacks

Add debugfs driver callbacks so drivers can add
debugfs entries for interfaces. Note that they
_must_ remove the entries again as add/remove in
the driver doesn't correspond to add/remove in
debugfs; the former is up/down while the latter
is netdev create/destroy.
