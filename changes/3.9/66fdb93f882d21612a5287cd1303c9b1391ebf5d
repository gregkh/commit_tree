afs: Remove unused structure afs_store_status

While looking for kuid_t and kgid_t conversions I found this
structure that has never been used since it was added to the
kernel in 2007.  The obvious for this structure to be used
is in xdr_encode_AFS_StoreStatus and that function uses a
small handful of local variables instead.

So remove the unnecessary structure to prevent confusion.
