target/rd: improve sg_table lookup scalability

Sequential scan of rd_dev->sg_table_array in rd_get_sg_table is
a serious I/O performance bottleneck for large rd LUNs. Fix this
by computing the sg_table index directly from page offset because
all sg_tables (except the last one) have the same number of pages.

Tested with 90 GiB rd_mcp LUN, where the patch improved maximal
random R/W IOPS by more than 100-150%, depending on actual
hardware and SAN setup.
