[media] em28xx: fix two severe bugs in function em2800_i2c_recv_bytes()

Function em2800_i2c_recv_bytes() has 2 severe bugs:
1) It does not wait for the i2c read to complete before reading the received message content from the bridge registers.
2) Reading more than 1 byte doesn't work
The former can result in data corruption, the latter always does.
The rewritten code also superseds the content of function
em2800_i2c_check_for_device().
Tested with device "Terratec Cinergy 200 USB".
