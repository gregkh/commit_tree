intel_idle: remove assumption of one C-state per MWAIT flag

Remove the assumption that cstate_tables are
indexed by MWAIT flag values.  Each entry
identifies itself via its own flags value.
This change is needed to support multiple states
that share the same MWAIT flags.

Note that this can have an effect on what state is described
by 'N' on cmdline intel_idle.max_cstate=N on some systems.

intel_idle.max_cstate=0 still disables the driver
intel_idle.max_cstate=1 still results in just C1(E)
However, "place holders" in the sparse C-state name-space
(eg. Atom) have been removed.
