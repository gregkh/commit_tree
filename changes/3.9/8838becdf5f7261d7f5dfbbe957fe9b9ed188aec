MIPS: ath79: fix GPIO function selection for AR934x SoCs

GPIO function selection is not working on the AR934x
SoCs because the offset of the function selection
register is different on those.

Add a helper routine which returns the correct
register address based on the SoC type, and use
that in the 'ath79_gpio_function_*' routines.
