ALSA: ASoC: cs4271: add optional soft reset workaround

The CS4271 requires its LRCLK and MCLK to be stable before its RESET
line is de-asserted. That also means that clocks cannot be changed
without putting the chip back into hardware reset, which also requires
a complete re-initialization of all registers.

One (undocumented) workaround is to assert and de-assert the PDN bit
in the MODE2 register.

This patch adds a new flag to both the DT bindings as well as to the
platform data to enable that workaround.
