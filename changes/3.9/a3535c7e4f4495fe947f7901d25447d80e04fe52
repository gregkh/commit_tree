module: clean up load_module a little more.

1fb9341ac34825aa40354e74d9a2c69df7d2c304 made our locking in
load_module more complicated: we grab the mutex once to insert the
module in the list, then again to upgrade it once it's formed.

Since the locking is self-contained, it's neater to do this in
separate functions.
