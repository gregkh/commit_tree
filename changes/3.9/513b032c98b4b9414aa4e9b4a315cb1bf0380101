pps: Add pps_lookup_dev() function

The PPS serial line discipline wants to attach a PPS device to a tty
without changing the tty code to add a struct pps_device * pointer.

Since the number of PPS devices in a typical system is generally very low
(n=1 is by far the most common), it's practical to search the entire list
of allocated pps devices.  (We capture the timestamp before the lookup,
so the timing isn't affected.)

It is a bit ugly that this function, which is part of the in-kernel
PPS API, has to be in pps.c as opposed to kapi,c, but that's not
something that affects users.
