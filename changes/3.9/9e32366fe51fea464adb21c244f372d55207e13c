ARM: tegra: make device can run on UP

The reset handler code is used for either UP or SMP. To make Tegra device
can compile for UP. It needs to be moved to another file that is not SMP
only. This is because the reset handler also be needed by CPU idle
"powered-down" mode. So we also need to put the reset handler init function
in non-SMP only and init them always.

And currently the implementation of the reset handler to know which CPU is
OK to bring up was identital with "cpu_present_mask". But the
"cpu_present_mask" did not initialize yet when the reset handler init
function was moved to init early function. We use the "cpu_possible_mask"
to replace "cpu_present_mask". Then it can work on both UP and SMP case.

[swarren: dropped the move of v7_invalidate_l1() from one file to another,
to avoid conflicts with Pavel's cleanup of this function, adjust Makefile
so each line only contains 1 file.]
