USB: usb-storage: unusual_devs update for Super TOP SATA bridge

The current entry in unusual_cypress.h for the Super TOP SATA bridge devices
seems to be causing corruption on newer revisions of this device.  This has
been reported in Arch Linux and Fedora.  The original patch was tested on
devices with bcdDevice of 1.60, whereas the newer devices report bcdDevice
as 2.20.  Limit the UNUSUAL_DEV entry to devices less than 2.20.
