NTB: Remove reads across NTB

CPU reads across NTB are slow(er) and can hang the local system if an
ECC error is encountered on the remote.  To work around the need for a
read, have the remote side write its current position in the rx buffer
to the local system's buffer and use that to see if there is room when
transmitting.
