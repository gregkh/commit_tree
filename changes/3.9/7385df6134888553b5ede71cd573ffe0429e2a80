ALSA: hda - Prefer binding the primary CLFE output

When 5.1 or more multiple speakers with found but not enough DACs are
available, it's better to bind such pins to the DACs of the primary
outputs with the same channels rather than binding to the first DAC
(i.e. the front channel).  For the cases with two speaker pins, it's
rather regarded as front + bass combination, thus it's more practical
to still bind to the front, though.
