tracing: Fix sparse warning with is_signed_type() macro

Sparse complains when is_signed_type() is used on a pointer.
This macro is needed for the format output used for ftrace
and perf, to know if a binary field is a signed type or not.
The is_signed_type() macro is used against all fields that are
recorded by events to automate the operation.

The problem sparse has is with the current way is_signed_type()
works:

  ((type)-1 < 0)

If "type" is a poiner, than sparse does not like it being compared
to an integer (zero). The simple fix is to just give zero the
same type. The runtime result stays the same.
