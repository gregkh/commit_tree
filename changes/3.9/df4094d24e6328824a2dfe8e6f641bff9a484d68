leds-lp5521/5523: use new lp55xx common header

 The LP55xx common driver provides a new header, leds-lp55xx.h.
 This driver enables removing duplicate code for both drivers and
 making coherent driver structure.
 LP5521 and LP5523/55231 platform data were merged into one common file.
 Therefore, the LP5521/5523 platform code need to be fixed.

 This patch has been already acked.
