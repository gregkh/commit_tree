ixgbe: Make ixgbe_setup_tc usable even when DCB is not enabled

The ixgbe_setup_tc code is essentially the same code we need any time we have
to update the number of queues.  As such I am making it available always and
just stripping the DCB specific bits out when DCB is disabled instead of
stripping the entire function.
