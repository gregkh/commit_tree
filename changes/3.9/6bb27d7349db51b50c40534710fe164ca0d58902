ARM: delete struct sys_timer

Now that the only field in struct sys_timer is .init, delete the struct,
and replace the machine descriptor .timer field with the initialization
function itself.

This will enable moving timer drivers into drivers/clocksource without
having to place a public prototype of each struct sys_timer object into
include/linux; the intent is to create a single of_clocksource_init()
function that determines which timer driver to initialize by scanning
the device dtree, much like the proposed irqchip_init() at:

Includes mach-omap2 fixes from Igor Grinberg.
