ARC: 64bit RTSC timestamp hardware issue

The 64bit RTSC is not reliable, causing spurious "jumps" in higher word,
making Linux timekeeping go bonkers. So as of now just use the lower
32bit timestamp.

A cleaner approach would have been removing RTSC support altogether as the
32bit RTSC is equivalent to old TIMER1 based solution, but some customers
can use the 32bit RTSC in SMP syn fashion (vs. TIMER1 which being incore
can't be done easily).

A fallout of this is sched_clock()'s hardware assisted version needs to
go away since it can't use 32bit wrapping counter - instead we use the
generic "weak" jiffies based version.
