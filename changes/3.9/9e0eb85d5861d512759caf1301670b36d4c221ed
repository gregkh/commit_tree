ceph: remove a few bogus declarations

There are three ceph page vector functions declared in
"fs/ceph/super.h" that don't belong there.  They're
probably left over from some long-ago code reorganization.

They're properly declared in "include/linux/ceph/libceph.h"
so just delete the ones in "super.h".

This and the next few commits resolve:
