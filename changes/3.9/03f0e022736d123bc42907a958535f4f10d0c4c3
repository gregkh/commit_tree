fs/9p: Don't use O_TRUNC flag in TOPEN and TLOPEN request

We do the truncate via setattr request, hence don't pass the O_TRUNC flag in
open request. Without this patch we end up sending zero sized write request
to server when we try to truncate. Some servers (VirtFS) were not handling that
properly.
