xfs: add a helper to figure out the space log reservation per item

Add a new helper xfs_calc_buf_res() to calcuate out the transaction space
reservations per item.  xfs_buf_log_overhead() is used to figure out the
extra space for struct xfs_buf_log_format that gets written into the log
for every buffer as well as a log opheader, i.e. struct xlog_op_header.
