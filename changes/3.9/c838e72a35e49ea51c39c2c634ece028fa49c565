metag: export clear_page and copy_page

Various file systems use clear_page() and copy_page(), so when they're
built as modules we get build errors like the following:

ERROR: "clear_page" [fs/ntfs/ntfs.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "copy_page" [fs/nilfs2/nilfs2.ko] undefined!

Therefore export these functions to modules from metag_ksyms.c to fix
the errors. This was hit by a randconfig build.
