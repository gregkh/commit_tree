debris left by "[SCSI] libfcoe: Remove mutex_trylock/restart_syscall checks"

	AFAICS, the situation for fcoe_transport_disable() seems to be
the same as for fcoe_transport_enable().  IOW, shouldn't it have
restart_syscall() removed as well?  I don't see any in-tree ->disable()
instances that could return -ERESTARTSYS, anyway...
