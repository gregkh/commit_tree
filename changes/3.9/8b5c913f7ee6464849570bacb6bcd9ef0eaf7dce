serial: 8250_pci: Add WCH CH352 quirk to avoid Xscale detection

The code in 8250.c for detecting ARM/XScale UARTs says:

  * Try writing and reading the UART_IER_UUE bit (b6).
  * If it works, this is probably one of the Xscale platform's
  * internal UARTs.

If the above passes, it then goes on to:

     * It's an Xscale.
     * We'll leave the UART_IER_UUE bit set to 1 (enabled).

However, the CH352 uses the UART_IER_UUE as the LOWPOWER function,
so it is readable and writable.  According to the datasheet:

    "LOWPOWER:When the bit is 1, close the internal benchmark
     clock of serial port to set into low-power status.

So it essentially gets mis-detected as Xscale, and gets
powered down in the process.  The device in question where
this was seen is listed by lspci as:

 Serial controller: Device 4348:3253 (rev 10) (prog-if 02 [16550])

Re-using the 353 quirk which just sets flags to fixed and type
to 16550 is suitable for fixing the 352 as well.
