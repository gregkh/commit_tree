staging: comedi: vmk80xx: make sure private data is clean when detached

Currently the private data used in this driver is stored in a static
array. During the usb (*probe) and empty location is found in this
array for use by the usb device. Some initialization of the private
data is then done before comedi_usb_auto_config() is called to allow
the comedi core to attach its comedi_device to the usb device.

The (*probe) can fail for various reasons. If it does, make sure that
the private data is clean before returning an error.

The usb (*disconnect) simply calls comedi_usb_auto_unconfig() to
allow the comedi core to disconnect its comedi_device from the usb
device. Since the private data points to the static array it cannot
be kfree'ed during the detach. Instead make sure it clean before
leaving the detach.
