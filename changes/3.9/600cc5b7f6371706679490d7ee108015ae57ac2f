mm: Kill NO_BOOTMEM version free_all_bootmem_node()

Now NO_BOOTMEM version free_all_bootmem_node() does not really
do free_bootmem at all, and it only call register_page_bootmem_info_node
for online nodes instead.

That is confusing.

We can kill that free_all_bootmem_node(), after we kill two callings
in x86 and sparc.
