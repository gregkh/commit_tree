ARM: sunxi: gpio: Add Allwinner SoCs GPIO drivers

The IP responsible for the muxing on the Allwinner SoCs are also
handling the GPIOs on the system. This patch adds the needed driver that
relies on the pinctrl driver for most of its operations.

The number of pins available for GPIOs operations are already declared
in the pinctrl driver, we only need to probe a generic driver to handle
the banks available for each SoC.

This driver has been tested on a A13-Olinuxino.
