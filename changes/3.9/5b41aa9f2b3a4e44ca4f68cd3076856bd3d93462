ab8500_btemp: Allign battery temperature resolution with the framework

The Linux Power Supply framework expects battery temperatures to have
a resolution of 0.1 degree Celsius; however, the AB8500 btemp driver
supplies a battery temperature resolution of 1 degree Celsius. We
therefore have to use a factor 10 on the measured values.
