libata: move acpi notification code to zpodd

Since the ata acpi notification code introduced in commit
3bd46600a7a7e938c54df8cdbac9910668c7dfb0 is solely for ZPODD, and we
now have a dedicated place for it, move these code there.

And the ata_acpi_add_pm_notifier code is changed a little bit in that it
is now invoked when scsi device is not bound with ACPI yet, so the way
to get the acpi handle is different with the previous version. And the
ata_acpi_add/remove_pm_notifier is also simplified a little bit in that
it doesn't check if the acpi_device for the handle exists or not as the
odd_can_poweroff function already checked that.
