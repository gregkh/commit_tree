x86: Merge early_reserve_initrd for 32bit and 64bit

They are the same, could move them out from head32/64.c to setup.c.

We are using memblock, and it could handle overlapping properly, so
we don't need to reserve some at first to hold the location, and just
need to make sure we reserve them before we are using memblock to find
free mem to use.
