wlcore: allow fw commands to fail

Currently, each fw command/acx that return a status code
different than CMD_STATUS_SUCCESS will trigger a recovery
in the driver.

However, it is a valid for some fw commands to fail (e.g.
due to temporary lack of resources), so add new functions
that allow passing bitmap of valid error return values.

(make the current wl1271_cmd_send/wl1271_cmd_configure
wrappers around the new functions, in order to avoid
changing the whole driver)
