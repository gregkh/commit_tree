MD: Prevent sysfs operations on uninitialized kobjects

MD: Prevent sysfs operations on uninitialized kobjects

Device-mapper does not use sysfs; but when device-mapper is leveraging
MD's RAID personalities, MD sometimes attempts to update sysfs.  This
patch adds checks for 'mddev-kobj.sd' in sysfs_[un]link_rdev to ensure
it is about to operate on something valid.  This patch also checks for
'mddev->kobj.sd' before calling 'sysfs_notify' in 'remove_and_add_spares'.
Although 'sysfs_notify' already makes this check, doing so in
'remove_and_add_spares' prevents an additional mutex operation.
