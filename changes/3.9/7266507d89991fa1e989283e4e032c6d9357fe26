netfilter: nf_ct_sip: support Cisco 7941/7945 IP phones

Most SIP devices use a source port of 5060/udp on SIP requests, so the
response automatically comes back to port 5060:

    phone_ip:5060 -> proxy_ip:5060   REGISTER
    proxy_ip:5060 -> phone_ip:5060   100 Trying

The newer Cisco IP phones, however, use a randomly chosen high source
port for the SIP request but expect the response on port 5060:

    phone_ip:49173 -> proxy_ip:5060  REGISTER
    proxy_ip:5060 -> phone_ip:5060   100 Trying

Standard Linux NAT, with or without nf_nat_sip, will send the reply back
to port 49173, not 5060:

    phone_ip:49173 -> proxy_ip:5060  REGISTER
    proxy_ip:5060 -> phone_ip:49173  100 Trying

But the phone is not listening on 49173, so it will never see the reply.

This patch modifies nf_*_sip to work around this quirk by extracting
the SIP response port from the Via: header, iff the source IP in the
packet header matches the source IP in the SIP request.
