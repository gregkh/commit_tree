ALSA: hda/realtek - Manage mixer controls in out_path list

As we parse the output paths more precisely now, we can use this path
list for parsing the widgets for volume and mute mixer controls.
The spec->vol_ctls[] and sw_ctls[] bitmasks are replaced with the
ctls[] in each output path instance.

Interestingly, this move alone automagically fixes some bugs that the
conflicting volume or mute NIDs weren't properly detected.
Also, by parsing the whole path, there are more chances to get a free
widget for volume/mute controls.
