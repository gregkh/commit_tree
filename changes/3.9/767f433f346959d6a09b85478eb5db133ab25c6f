GFS2: Copy gfs2_trans_add_bh into new data/meta functions

This patch copies the body of gfs2_trans_add_bh into the two newly
added gfs2_trans_add_data and gfs2_trans_add_meta functions. We can
then move the .lo_add functions from lops.c into trans.c and call
them directly.

As a result of this, we no longer need to use the .lo_add functions
at all, so that is removed from the log operations structure.
