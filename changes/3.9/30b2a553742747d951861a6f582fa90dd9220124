regmap: include linux/sched.h to fix build

This fixes:

drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c: In function 'regmap_async_complete_cb':
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:1656:3: error: 'TASK_NORMAL' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:1656:3: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c: In function 'regmap_async_complete':
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:1688:2: error: 'TASK_UNINTERRUPTIBLE' undeclared (first use in this function)
drivers/base/regmap/regmap.c:1688:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'schedule'

An alternative might be to adjust linux/wait.h to include linux/sched.h,
but since that hasn't been done before, I assume we're consciously
avoiding doing that.
