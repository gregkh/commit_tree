s390/uaccess: fix strncpy_from_user/strnlen_user zero maxlen case

If the maximum length specified for the to be accessed string for
strncpy_from_user() and strnlen_user() is zero the following incorrect
values would be returned or incorrect memory accesses would happen:

strnlen_user_std() and strnlen_user_pt() incorrectly return "1"
strncpy_from_user_pt() would incorrectly access "dst[maxlen - 1]"
strncpy_from_user_mvcos() would incorrectly return "-EFAULT"

Fix all these oddities by adding early checks.
