cfg80211: Pass TDLS peer's QoS/HT/VHT information during set_station

The information of the peer's capabilities is required for the driver
to perform TDLS Peer UAPSD operations. This information of the peer is
passed by the supplicant using NL80211_CMD_SET_STATION command. This
commit enhances the function nl80211_set_station to pass this
information of the peer to the driver in case this command is used
with the TDLS peer STA.

In addition, make the HT/VHT capability configuration handled more
consistently for other STA cases (reject both instead of just HT).
