powerpc/85xx: update sbc8548 flash information to match recent u-boot

The original memory map for the sbc8548 had the 64MB SODIMM flash
device misaligned by 8MB to allow a window of address space for
the soldered on 8MB device -- i.e.

 start           end             CS<n>   width   Desc.
 ----------------------------------------------------------
 fb80_0000       ff7f_ffff       CS6     32      SODIMM flash (64MB)
 ff80_0000       ffff_ffff       CS0     8       Boot flash (8MB)

However, if we want to change the configuration so that it boots
off the 64MB flash, it is in turn then aligned with a 64MB boundary,
starting at fc00_0000 (and the 8MB @ fb80_0000 -> fbff_ffff).

This makes for complicated updates, since what is the beginning
of the physical device is 8MB into its address space in the default
configuration shown above.

This issue was fixed as of u-boot commit 3fd673cf363bc86ed42eff713d4
("sbc8548: relocate 64MB user flash to sane boundary") -- in which
the SODIMM was mapped to ec00_0000 (natively aligned under efff_ffff)
and so when JP12/SW2.8 are switched, it will be a a simple 0xec --> 0xfc
mapping between the two instances.

Here we make the associated changes in the localbus flash memory
map in the dts file:  indicating the 64MB device starts at ec00_0000
and that the tail end of the 64MB device (last 2 sectors) can contain
a bootloader image.

The partitions for both flash devices get a clean-up; there were
non-meaningful assignments in there that probably originated from
the MPC8548CDS on which the file was based on.  Now there is just
the categorization of free space and bootloader images.
