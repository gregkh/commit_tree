serial: sirf: only use lookup table to set baudrate when ioclk=150MHz

The fast lookup table to set baudrate is only right when ioclk
is 150MHz. for most platforms, ioclk is 150MHz, but some boards
might set ioclk to other frequency.

so re-calc the clk_div_reg when ioclk is not 150MHz. this patch
also gets clk in probe and puts it in remove.
