[media] em28xx: move the em2710/em2750/em28xx specific frame data processing code to a separate function

em28xx_urb_data_copy() actually consists of two parts:
USB urb processing (checks, data extraction) and frame data packet processing.
Move the latter to a separate function and call it from em28xx_urb_data_copy()
for each data packet.
The em25xx, em2760, em2765 (and likely em277x) chip variants are using a
different frame data format, for which support will be added later with
another function.
This reduces the size of em28xx_urb_data_copy() and makes the code much more
readable. While we're at it, clean up the code a bit (rename some variables to
something more meaningful, improve some comments etc.)
