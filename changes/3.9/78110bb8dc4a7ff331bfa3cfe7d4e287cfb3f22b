staging: Remove unnecessary OOM messages

alloc failures already get standardized OOM
messages and a dump_stack.

For the affected mallocs around these OOM messages:

Converted kzallocs with multiplies to kcalloc.
Converted kmallocs with multiplies to kmalloc_array.
Converted a kmalloc/strlen/strncpy to kstrdup.
Moved a spin_lock below a removed OOM message and
removed a now unnecessary spin_unlock.
Neatened alignment and whitespace.
