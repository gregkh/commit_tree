kvm: fix i8254 counter 0 wraparound

The kvm i8254 emulation for counter 0 (but not for counters 1 and 2)
has at least two bugs in mode 0:

1. The OUT bit, computed by pit_get_out(), is never set high.

2. The counter value, computed by pit_get_count(), wraps back around to
   the initial counter value, rather than wrapping back to 0xFFFF
   (which is the behavior described in the comment in __kpit_elapsed,
   the behavior implemented by qemu, and the behavior observed on AMD
   hardware).

The bug stems from __kpit_elapsed computing the elapsed time mod the
initial counter value (stored as nanoseconds in ps->period).  This is both
unnecessary (none of the callers of kpit_elapsed expect the value to be
at most the initial counter value) and incorrect (it causes pit_get_count
to appear to wrap around to the initial counter value rather than 0xFFFF).
Removing this mod from __kpit_elapsed fixes both of the above bugs.
