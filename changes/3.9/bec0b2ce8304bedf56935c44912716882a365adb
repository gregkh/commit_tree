pcmcia: avoid static analysis complaint about use-after-free

Coverity complains about a use after free for 'res1' and 'res2' since
we use the value of the pointers in a 'dev_dbg()' after they have been
freed. That's not really a problem, but it still seems cleaner to
defer freeing until we are completely done with the pointers.
