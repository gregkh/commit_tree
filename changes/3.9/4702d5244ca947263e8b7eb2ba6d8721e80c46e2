dw_dmac: return proper residue value

Currently the driver returns full length of the active descriptor which is
wrong. We have to go throught the active descriptor and substract the length of
each sent children in the chain from the total length along with the actual
data in the DMA channel registers.

The cyclic case is not handled by this patch due to len field in the descriptor
structure is left untouched by the original code.
