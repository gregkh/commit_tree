usb: musb: omap2430: fix wrong devm_kzalloc() result check

Commit 00a0b1d58af873d842580dcac55f3b156c3a4077 (usb: musb: omap: Add device
tree support for omap musb glue) assigns result of devm_kzalloc() call to
the 'config' variable but then checks for NULL the 'data' variable (already

pointed by 'config' is written to by subsequent of_property_read_u32() calls
iff the allocation happens to fail...
