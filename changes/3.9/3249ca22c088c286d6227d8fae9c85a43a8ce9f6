usb: gadget: u_serial: convert into a module

Every user of u_serial has now to select the U_SERIAL symbol instead of
including the file.
There is one limition with this: ports and and gs_tty_driver are global
variables in u_serial. Since all users share them, there can be only one
user loaded at a time i.e. either g_serial or g_nokia.
