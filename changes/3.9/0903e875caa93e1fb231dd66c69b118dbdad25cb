rbd: use a common layout for each device

Each osd message includes a layout structure, and for rbd it is
always the same (at least for osd's in a given pool).

Initialize a layout structure when an rbd_dev gets created and just
copy that into osd requests for the rbd image.

Replace an assertion that was done when initializing the layout
structures with code that catches and handles anything that would
trigger the assertion as soon as it is identified.  This precludes
that (bad) condition from ever occurring.
