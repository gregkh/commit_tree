NFSv4.1: Add a helper pnfs_commit_and_return_layout

In order to be able to safely return the layout in nfs4_proc_setattr,
we need to block new uses of the layout, wait for all outstanding
users of the layout to complete, commit the layout and then return it.

This patch adds a helper in order to do all this safely.
