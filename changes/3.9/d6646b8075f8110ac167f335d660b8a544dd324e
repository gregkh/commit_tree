[media] sh-mobile-ceu-camera: fix SHARPNESS control default

The V4L2_CID_SHARPNESS control in the sh-mobile-ceu-camera driver, if off,
turns the CEU low-pass filter on. This is the opposite to the hardware
default and can degrade image quality. Switch default to on to restore the
default unfiltered mode.
