crypto: omap-aes - Add OMAP4/AM33XX AES Support

Add support for the OMAP4 version of the AES module
that is present on OMAP4 and AM33xx SoCs.

The modules have several differences including register
offsets and how DMA is triggered.  To handle these
differences, a platform_data structure is defined and
contains routine pointers, register offsets, and bit
offsets within registers.  OMAP2/OMAP3-specific routines
are suffixed with '_omap2' and OMAP4/AM33xx routines are
suffixed with '_omap4'.

Note: The code being integrated is from the TI AM33xx SDK
and was written by Greg Turner <gkmturner@gmail.com> and
Herman Schuurman (current email unknown) while at TI.
