dw_dmac: absence of pdata isn't critical when autocfg is set

The patch allows to probe the device when platform data is absent and hardware
auto configuration is enabled. In that case the default platform data is used
where the channel allocation order is set to ascending, channel priority is set
to ascending, and private property is set to true.
