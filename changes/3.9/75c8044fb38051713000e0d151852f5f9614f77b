ACPICA: Cleanup updated comments.

This is a cosmetic patch only. Comparison of the resulting binary showed
only line number differences.

This patch does not affect the generation of the Linux binary.
This patch decreases 558 lines of 20121018 divergence.diff.

This patch reduces the source code diff between Linux and ACPICA by
cleaning the comments that already have been updated in ACPICA.

There is no extra indentation done in this patch. Even the empty line
deletions and insertions are also splitted into another cleanup patch so
that this patch can be easily reviewed, and the binary differences can be
held to a lowest level.
