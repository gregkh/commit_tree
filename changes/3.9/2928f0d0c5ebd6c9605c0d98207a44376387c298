UBIFS: fix use of freed ubifs_orphan objects

The last orphan in the cnext list has its cnext set to NULL. Because
of that, ubifs_delete_orphan assumes that it is not on the cnext list
and frees it immediately instead of adding it to the dnext list. The
freed orphan is later modified by write_orph_node.

This can cause various inconsistencies including directory entries
that cannot be removed and this error:

UBIFS error (pid 20685): layout_cnodes: LPT out of space at LEB 14:129009 needing 17, done_ltab 1, done_lsave 1

This is a regression introduced by
"7074e5eb UBIFS: remove invalid reference to list iterator variable".

This change adds an explicit flag to ubifs_orphan indicating whether
it is pending commit.
