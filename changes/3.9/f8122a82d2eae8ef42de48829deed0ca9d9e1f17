dw_dmac: allocate dma descriptors from DMA_COHERENT memory

Currently descriptors are allocated from normal cacheable memory and that slows
down filling the descriptors, as we need to call cache_coherency routines
afterwards. It would be better to allocate memory for these descriptors from
DMA_COHERENT memory. This would make code much cleaner too.
