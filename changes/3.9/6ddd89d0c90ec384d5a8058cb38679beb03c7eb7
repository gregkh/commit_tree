[media] em28xx: create a common function for isoc and bulk URB allocation and setup

Rename the existing function for isoc transfers em28xx_init_isoc
to em28xx_init_usb_xfer and extend it.
URB allocation and setup is now done depending on the USB
transfer type, which is selected with a new function parameter.
