perf tools, powerpc: Fix compile warnings in tests/attr.c

We print several '__u64' quantities using '%llu'. On powerpc, we by
default include '<asm-generic/int-l64.h> which results in __u64 being an
unsigned long. This causes compile warnings which are treated as errors
due to '-Werror'.

By defining __SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__ we include <asm-generic/int-ll64.h>
and define __u64 as unsigned long long.

Changelog[v2]:
	[Michael Ellerman] Use __SANE_USERSPACE_TYPES__ and avoid PRIu64
	format specifier - which as Jiri Olsa pointed out, breaks on x86-64.
