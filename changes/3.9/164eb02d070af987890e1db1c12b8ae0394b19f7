mac80211: add radar detection command/event

Add command to trigger radar detection in the driver/FW.
Once radar detection is started it should continuously
monitor for radars as long as the channel active.
If radar is detected usermode notified with 'radar
detected' event.

Scanning and remain on channel functionality must be disabled
while doing radar detection/scanning, and vice versa.
