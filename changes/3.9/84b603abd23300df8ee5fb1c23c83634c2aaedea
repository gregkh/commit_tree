x86/intel/cacheinfo: Shut up annoying warning

I've been getting the following warning when doing randbuilds
since forever. Now it finally pissed me off just the perfect
amount so that I can fix it.

  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:489:27: warning: ‘cache_disable_0’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]
  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:491:27: warning: ‘cache_disable_1’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable] arch/x86/kernel/cpu/intel_cacheinfo.c:524:27: warning: ‘subcaches’ defined but not used [-Wunused-variable]

It happens because in randconfigs where CONFIG_SYSFS is not set,
the whole sysfs-interface to L3 cache index disabling is
remaining unused and gcc correctly warns about it. Make it
optional, depending on CONFIG_SYSFS too, as is the case with
other sysfs-related machinery in this file.
