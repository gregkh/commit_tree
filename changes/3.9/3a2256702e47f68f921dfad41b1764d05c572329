ext4: fix the wrong number of the allocated blocks in ext4_split_extent()

This commit fixes a wrong return value of the number of the allocated
blocks in ext4_split_extent.  When the length of blocks we want to
allocate is greater than the length of the current extent, we return a
wrong number.  Let's see what happens in the following case when we
call ext4_split_extent().

  map: [48, 72]
  ex:  [32, 64, u]

'ex' will be split into two parts:
  ex1: [32, 47, u]
  ex2: [48, 64, w]

'map->m_len' is returned from this function, and the value is 24.  But
the real length is 16.  So it should be fixed.

Meanwhile in this commit we use right length of the allocated blocks
when get_reserved_cluster_alloc in ext4_ext_handle_uninitialized_extents
is called.
