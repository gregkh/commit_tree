gpiolib: link all gpio_chips using a list

Add a list member to gpio_chip that allows all chips to be parsed
quickly. The current method requires parsing the entire GPIO integer
space, which is painfully slow. Using a list makes many chip operations
that involve lookup or parsing faster, and also simplifies the code. It
is also necessary to eventually get rid of the global gpio_desc[] array.

The list of gpio_chips is always ordered by base GPIO number to ensure
chips traversal is done in the right order.
