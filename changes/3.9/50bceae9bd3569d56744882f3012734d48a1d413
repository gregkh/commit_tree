tcp: Reallocate headroom if it would overflow csum_start

If a TCP retransmission gets partially ACKed and collapsed multiple
times it is possible for the headroom to grow beyond 64K which will
overflow the 16bit skb->csum_start which is based on the start of
the headroom. It has been observed rarely in the wild with IPoIB due
to the 64K MTU.

Verify if the acking and collapsing resulted in a headroom exceeding
what csum_start can cover and reallocate the headroom if so.

A big thank you to Jim Foraker <foraker1@llnl.gov> and the team at
LLNL for helping out with the investigation and testing.
