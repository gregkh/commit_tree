rbd: send notify ack asynchronously

When we receive notification of a change to an rbd image's header
object we need to refresh our information about the image (its
size and snapshot context).  Once we have refreshed our rbd image
we need to acknowledge the notification.

This acknowledgement was previously done synchronously, but there's
really no need to wait for it to complete.

Change it so the caller doesn't wait for the notify acknowledgement
request to complete.  And change the name to reflect it's no longer
synchronous.

This resolves:
