ext4: use atomic64_t for the per-flexbg free_clusters count

A user who was using a 8TB+ file system and with a very large flexbg
size (> 65536) could cause the atomic_t used in the struct flex_groups
to overflow.  This was detected by PaX security patchset:

This bug was introduced in commit 9f24e4208f7e, so it's been around
since 2.6.30.  :-(

Fix this by using an atomic64_t for struct orlav_stats's
free_clusters.
