ALSA: hda - Avoid auto-mute or auto-mic of retasked jacks

When a jack is retasked as a different direction (e.g. a mic jack is
used as a CLFE output), such a jack shouldn't be counted as the target
for the automatic jack switching.  Skip the automute or the autoswitch
when the current pinctl direction is different from what we suppose.
