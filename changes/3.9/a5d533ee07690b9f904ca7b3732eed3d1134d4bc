ARM: disable virt_to_bus/virt_to_bus almost everywhere

We are getting a number of warnings about the use of the deprecated
bus_to_virt function in drivers using the ARM ISA DMA API:

drivers/parport/parport_pc.c: In function 'parport_pc_fifo_write_block_dma':
drivers/parport/parport_pc.c:622:3: warning: 'bus_to_virt' is deprecated
(declared at arch/arm/include/asm/memory.h:253) [-Wdeprecated-declarations]

This is only because that function gets used by the inline
set_dma_addr() helper. We know that any driver for the ISA DMA API
is correctly using the DMA addresses, so we can change this
to use the __bus_to_virt() function instead, which does not warn.

After this, there are no remaining drivers that are used on
any defconfigs on ARM using virt_to_bus or bus_to_virt, with
the exception of the OSS sound driver. That driver is only used
on RiscPC, NetWinder and Shark, so we can set ARCH_NO_VIRT_TO_BUS
on all other platforms and hide the deprecated functions, which
is far more effective than marking them as deprecated, in order
to avoid any new users of that code.
