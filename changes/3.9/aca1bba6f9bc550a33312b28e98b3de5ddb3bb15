Btrfs: build up error handling for merge_reloc_roots

We first use btrfs_std_error hook to replace with BUG_ON, and we
also need to cleanup what is left, including reloc roots rbtree
and reloc roots list.
Here we use a helper function to cleanup both rbtree and list, and
since this function can also be used in the balance recover path,
we also make the change as well to keep code simple.
