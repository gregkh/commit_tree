x86/ftrace: Use __pa_symbol instead of __pa on C visible symbols

Instead of using __pa which is meant to be a general function for converting
virtual addresses to physical addresses we can use __pa_symbol which is the
preferred way of decoding kernel text virtual addresses to physical addresses.

In this case we are not directly converting C visible symbols however if we
know that the instruction pointer is somewhere between _text and _etext we
know that we are going to be translating an address form the kernel text
space.
