x86, kvm: Add MSR_AMD64_BU_CFG2 to the list of ignored MSRs

The "x86, AMD: Enable WC+ memory type on family 10 processors" patch
currently in -tip added a workaround for AMD F10h CPUs which #GPs my
guest when booted in kvm. This is because it accesses MSR_AMD64_BU_CFG2
which is not currently ignored by kvm. Do that because this MSR is only
baremetal-relevant anyway. While at it, move the ignored MSRs at the
beginning of kvm_set_msr_common so that we exit then and there.
