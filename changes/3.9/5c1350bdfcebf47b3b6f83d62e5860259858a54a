ARM: tegra20: cpuidle: add powered-down state for secondary CPU

The powered-down state of Tegra20 requires power gating both CPU cores.
When the secondary CPU requests to enter powered-down state, it saves
its own contexts and then enters WFI. The Tegra20 had a limition to
power down both CPU cores. The secondary CPU must waits for CPU0 in
powered-down state too. If the secondary CPU be woken up before CPU0
entering powered-down state, then it needs to restore its CPU states
and waits for next chance.

Be aware of that, you may see the legacy power state "LP2" in the code
which is exactly the same meaning of "CPU power down".
