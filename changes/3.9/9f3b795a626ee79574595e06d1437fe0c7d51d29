driver-core: constify data for class_find_device()

All in-kernel users of class_find_device() don't really need mutable
data for match callback.

In two places (kernel/power/suspend_test.c, drivers/scsi/osd/osd_uld.c)
this patch changes match callbacks to use const search data.

The const is propagated to rtc_class_open() and power_supply_get_by_name()
parameters.

Note that there's a dev reference leak in suspend_test.c that's not
touched in this patch.
