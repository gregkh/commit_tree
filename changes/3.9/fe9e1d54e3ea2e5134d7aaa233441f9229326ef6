powerpc: Add code to handle soft-disabled doorbells on server

This patch adds the logic to properly handle doorbells that come in when
interrupts have been soft disabled and to replay them when interrupts
are re-enabled:

- masked_##_H##interrupt is modified to leave interrupts enabled when a
  doorbell has come in since doorbells are edge sensitive and as such
  won't be automatically re-raised.

- __check_irq_replay now tests if a doorbell happened on book3s, and
  returns either 0xe80 or 0xa00 depending on whether we are the
  hypervisor or not.

- restore_check_irq_replay now tests for the two possible server
  doorbell vector numbers to replay.

- __replay_interrupt also adds tests for the two server doorbell vector
  numbers, and is modified to use a compare instruction rather than an
  andi. on the single bit difference between 0x500 and 0x900.

The last two use a CPU feature section to avoid needlessly testing
against the hypervisor vector if it is not the hypervisor, and vice
versa.
