bonding: Fix race condition between bond_enslave() and bond_3ad_update_lacp_rate()

port->slave can be NULL since it's being initialized in bond_enslave
thus dereferencing a NULL pointer in bond_3ad_update_lacp_rate()
Also fix a minor bug, which could cause a port not to have
AD_STATE_LACP_TIMEOUT since there's no sync between
bond_3ad_update_lacp_rate() and bond_3ad_bind_slave(), by changing
the read_lock to a write_lock_bh in bond_3ad_update_lacp_rate().
