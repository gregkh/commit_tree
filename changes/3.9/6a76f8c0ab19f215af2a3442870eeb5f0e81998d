tracing: Fix possible NULL pointer dereferences

Currently set_ftrace_pid and set_graph_function files use seq_lseek
for their fops.  However seq_open() is called only for FMODE_READ in
the fops->open() so that if an user tries to seek one of those file
when she open it for writing, it sees NULL seq_file and then panic.

It can be easily reproduced with following command:

  $ cd /sys/kernel/debug/tracing
  $ echo 1234 | sudo tee -a set_ftrace_pid

In this example, GNU coreutils' tee opens the file with fopen(, "a")
and then the fopen() internally calls lseek().
