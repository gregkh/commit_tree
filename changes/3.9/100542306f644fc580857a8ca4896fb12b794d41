x86, 64bit: Don't set max_pfn_mapped wrong value early on native path

We are not having max_pfn_mapped set correctly until init_memory_mapping.
So don't print its initial value for 64bit

Also need to use KERNEL_IMAGE_SIZE directly for highmap cleanup.

-v2: update comments about max_pfn_mapped according to Stefano Stabellini.
