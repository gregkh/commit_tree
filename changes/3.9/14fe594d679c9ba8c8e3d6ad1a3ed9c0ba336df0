dm: rename bio cloning functions

Rename functions involved in splitting and cloning bios.

The sequence of functions is now:
  (1) __split_and_process* - entry point that selects the processing strategy
  (2) __send* - prepare the details for each bio needed and loop through them
  (3) __clone_and_map* - creates a clone and maps it
