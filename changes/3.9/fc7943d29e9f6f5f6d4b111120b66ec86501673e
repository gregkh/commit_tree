ARC: [Review] Multi-platform image #6: cpu-to-dma-addr optional

All the current platforms can work with 0x8000_0000 based dma_addr_t
since the Bus Bridges typically ignore the top bit (the only excpetion
was Angel4 PCI-AHB bridge which we no longer care for).
That way we don't need plat-specific cpu-addr to bus-addr conversion.

Hooks still provided - just in case a platform has an obscure device
which say needs 0 based bus address.

That way <asm/dma_mapping.h> no longer needs to unconditinally include
<plat/dma_addr.h>

Also verfied that on Angel4 board, other peripherals (IDE-disk / EMAC)
work fine with 0x8000_0000 based dma addresses.
