usb: gadget: factor out two helper functions from composite_bind()

This patch factors out two helper functions from composite_bind()
that is composite_dev_prepare() and its counterpart
composite_dev_cleanup().

This will be used by the configfs which requries a slightly different
bind/setup code because part of its configurations (i.e. config
descripts, cdev, â€¦) are setup in advance and VID/PID and so one should
not be overwritten. Also the setup of ep0 endpoint can be delayed until
the UDC is assigned.
