ext4: fix smatch warning in move_extent.c's mext_replace_branches()

Commit 2147b1a6a48 resulted in a new smatch warning:

> fs/ext4/move_extent.c:693 mext_replace_branches()
> 	 warn: variable dereferenced before check 'dext' (see line 683)

Fix this by adding a check to make sure dext is non-NULL before we
derefrence it.
