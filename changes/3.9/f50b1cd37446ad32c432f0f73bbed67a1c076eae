ath9k: Re-enable interrupts after a channel change failure

ath_complete_reset will not be called if ath9k_hw_reset
is unsuccessful, so we need to re-enable intertupts to
balence the previous ath_prepare_reset call.  Also schedule a
reset as a best effort method to recover the chip from
whatever state caused the channel change failure.
