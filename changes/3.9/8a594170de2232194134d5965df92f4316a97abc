drivers/net: delete intel i825xx based znet notebook driver

This driver supported early to mid 1990's Zenith laptops, of the
2" thick variety.  The driver was already dead 10+ years ago, but
we see this in the source:

 ----------------
 /* 10/2002

 [...]

   Tested on a vintage Zenith Z-Note 433Lnp+. Probably broken on
   anything else. Testers (and detailed bug reports) are welcome :-).
 ----------------

To clarify, a 433 translates into a 486 at 33MHz, and a system with
a default of 4MB RAM.  I can't fault the noble effort to keep things
working a decade ago, but at this point in time, there is no valid
justification to continue carrying this driver along.

Note that there is no associated Space.c cleanup here since this
driver was using module_init to hook itself in.
