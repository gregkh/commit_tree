GFS2: Split gfs2_trans_add_bh() into two

There is little common content in gfs2_trans_add_bh() between the data
and meta classes by the time that the functions which it calls are
taken into account. The intent here is to split this into two
separate functions. Stage one is to introduce gfs2_trans_add_data()
and gfs2_trans_add_meta() and update the callers accordingly.

Later patches will then pull in the content of gfs2_trans_add_bh()
and its dependent functions in order to clean up the code in this
area.
