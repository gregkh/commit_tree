x86, uv, uv3: Update MMR register definitions for SGI Ultraviolet System 3 (UV3)

This patch updates the MMR register definitions for the SGI UV3 system.
Note that because these definitions are automatically generated from
the RTL we cannot control the length of the names.  Therefore there are
lines that exceed 80 characters.

All the new MMR definitions are added in this patch.  The patches that
follow then update the references. The last patch is a "trim" patch
which reduces the size of the MMR definitions file by about a third.
This keeps "bi-sectability" in place as the intermediate patches would
not compile correctly if the trimmed MMR defines were done first.
