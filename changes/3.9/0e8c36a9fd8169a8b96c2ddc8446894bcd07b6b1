Btrfs: fix lots of orphan inodes when the space is not enough

We're running into having 50-100 orphans left over with xfstests 83
because of ENOSPC when trying to start the transaction for the inode update.
But in fact, it makes no sense in updating the inode for the new size while
we're deleting the stupid thing. This patch fixes this problem.
