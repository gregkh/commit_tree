ALSA: hda/realtek - Generic mute LED implementation for HP laptops

As David Henningsson recently suggested, some HP laptops use an unused
mic pin for controlling a mute LED, and this information is provided
via DMI string "HP_Mute_LED_X_Y" string.  This patch adds the generic
support for such cases, as we've already done in patch_sigmatel.c.
This is applied generically to all devices with ID 0x103c.

But as we don't know whether the device 103c:1586 really contains
HP_Mute_LED_X_Y DMI string, still keep the static setup for this
device using the mic2 pin 0x19.
