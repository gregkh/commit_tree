drivers/net: delete orphaned MCA ibmlana driver content

In commit a5e371f61ad33c07b28e7c9b60c78d71fdd34e2a ("drivers/net: delete
all code/drivers depending on CONFIG_MCA") most of the MCA drivers went,
including the Kconfig/Makefile hooks for ibmlana, but it seems that I
missed the "git rm" on these actual driver files, and with the namespace
overlap with machine check architecture, it got missed by various git
grep type checking done at that time.
