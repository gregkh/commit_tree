[media] em28xx: move caching of pointer to vmalloc memory in videobuf to struct em28xx_buffer

In the current code em28xx_urb_data_copy() caches the pointer to the vmalloc
memory in videobuf locally.
The alternative would be to call videobuf_to_vmalloc() for each processed USB
data packet (isoc USB transfers => 64 times per URB) in the em28xx_copy_*()
functions.
With the next commits, the data processing code will be split into functions
for serveral reasons:
- em28xx_urb_data_copy() is generally way to long, making it less readable
- there is code duplication between VBI and video data processing
- support for em25xx data processing (uses a different header and frame
  end signaling mechanism) will be added
This would require extensive usage of pointer-pointers, which usually makes the
code less readable and prone to bugs.
The better solution is to cache the pointer in struct em28xx_buffer.
This also improves consistency, because we already track the buffer fill count there.
