ext4: optimize ext4_es_shrink()

When the system is under memory pressure, ext4_es_srhink() will get
called very often.  So optimize returning the number of items in the
file system's extent status cache by keeping a per-filesystem count,
instead of calculating it each time by scanning all of the inodes in
the extent status cache.

Also rename the slab used for the extent status cache to be
"ext4_extent_status" so it's obviousl the slab in question is created
by ext4.
