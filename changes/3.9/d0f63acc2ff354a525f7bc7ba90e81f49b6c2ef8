igb: Fix null pointer dereference

The max_vfs= option has always been self limiting to the number of VFs
supported by the device.  fa44f2f1 added SR-IOV configuration via
sysfs, but in the process broke this self correction factor.  The
failing path is:

igb_probe
  igb_sw_init
    if (max_vfs > 7) {
        adapter->vfs_allocated_count = 7;
    ...
    igb_probe_vfs
    igb_enable_sriov(, max_vfs)
      if (num_vfs > 7) {
        err = -EPERM;
        ...

This leaves vfs_allocated_count = 7 and vf_data = NULL, so we bomb out
when igb_probe finally calls igb_reset.  It seems like a really bad
idea, and somewhat pointless, to set vfs_allocated_count separate from
vf_data, but limiting max_vfs is enough to avoid the null pointer.
