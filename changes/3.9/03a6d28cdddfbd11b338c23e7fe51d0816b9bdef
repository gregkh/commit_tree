ARC: [Review] Multi-platform image #2: Board callback Infrastructure

The orig platform code orgnaization was singleton design pattern - only
one platform (and board thereof) would build at a time.

Thus any platform/board specific code (e.g. irq init, early init ...)
expected by ARC common code was exported as well defined set of APIs,
with only ONE instance building ever.

Now with multiple-platform build requirement, that design of code no
longer holds - multiple board specific calls need to build at the same
time - so ARC common code can't use the API approach, it needs a
callback based design where each board registers it's specific set of
functions, and at runtime, depending on board detection, the callbacks
are used from the registry.

This commit adds all the infrastructure, where board specific callbacks
are specified as a "maThine description".

All the hooks are placed in right spots, no board callbacks registered
yet (with MACHINE_STARt/END constructs) so the hooks will not run.

Next commit will actually convert the platform to this infrastructure.
