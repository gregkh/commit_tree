x86 idle: remove mwait_idle() and "idle=mwait" cmdline param

mwait_idle() is a C1-only idle loop intended to be more efficient
than HLT, starting on Pentium-4 HT-enabled processors.

But mwait_idle() has been replaced by the more general
mwait_idle_with_hints(), which handles both C1 and deeper C-states.
ACPI processor_idle and intel_idle use only mwait_idle_with_hints(),
and no longer use mwait_idle().

Here we simplify the x86 native idle code by removing mwait_idle(),
and the "idle=mwait" bootparam used to invoke it.

Since Linux 3.0 there has been a boot-time warning when "idle=mwait"
was invoked saying it would be removed in 2012.  This removal
was also noted in the (now removed:-) feature-removal-schedule.txt.

After this change, kernels configured with
(CONFIG_ACPI=n && CONFIG_INTEL_IDLE=n) when run on hardware
that supports MWAIT will simply use HLT.  If MWAIT is desired
on those systems, cpuidle and the cpuidle drivers above
can be enabled.
