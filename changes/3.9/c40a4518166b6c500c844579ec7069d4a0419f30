acpi-cpufreq: Do not load on K8

de3ed81d746d ("[CPUFREQ] Change link order of x86 cpufreq modules")
changed cpufreq drivers link order so that powernow-k8 gets loaded first
due to earlier K8s having BIOS bugs.

However, now that acpi-cpufreq supports both AMD and Intel CPUs with HW
P-states, we want to load it first, so that cases where acpi-cpufreq and
powernow-k8 are both built-in and powernow-k8 initializing first, can be
addressed.

So, make sure that even if acpi-cpufreq gets loaded first, it errors out
on K8s and powernow-k8 can be loaded then successfully.
