NFSv4.1: Fix bulk recall and destroy of layouts

The current code in pnfs_destroy_all_layouts() assumes that removing
the layout from the server->layouts list is sufficient to make it
invisible to other processes. This ignores the fact that most
users access the layout through the nfs_inode->layout...
There is further breakage due to lack of reference counting of the
layouts, meaning that the whole thing Oopses at the drop of a hat.

The code in initiate_bulk_draining() is almost correct, and can be
used as a model for pnfs_destroy_all_layouts(), so move that
code to pnfs.c, and refactor the code to allow us to choose between
a single filesystem bulk recall, and a recall of all layouts.
Also note that initiate_bulk_draining() currently calls iput() while
holding locks. Fix that too.
