KVM: ARM: Introduce KVM_ARM_SET_DEVICE_ADDR ioctl

On ARM some bits are specific to the model being emulated for the guest and
user space needs a way to tell the kernel about those bits.  An example is mmio
device base addresses, where KVM must know the base address for a given device
to properly emulate mmio accesses within a certain address range or directly
map a device with virtualiation extensions into the guest address space.

We make this API ARM-specific as we haven't yet reached a consensus for a
generic API for all KVM architectures that will allow us to do something like
this.
