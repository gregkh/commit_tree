genirq: Avoid deadlock in spurious handling

commit 52553ddf(genirq: fix regression in irqfixup, irqpoll)
introduced a potential deadlock by calling the action handler with the
irq descriptor lock held.

Remove the call and let the handling code run even for an interrupt
where only a single action is registered. That matches the goal of
the above commit and avoids the deadlock.

Document the confusing action = desc->action reload in the handling
loop while at it.
