Btrfs: use set_nlink if our i_nlink is 0

We need to inc the nlink of deleted entries when running replay so we can do the
unlink on the fs_root and get everything cleaned up and then have the orphan
cleanup do the right thing.  The problem is inc_nlink complains about this, even
thought it still does the right thing.  So use set_nlink() if our i_nlink is 0
to keep users from seeing the warnings during log replay.  Thanks,
