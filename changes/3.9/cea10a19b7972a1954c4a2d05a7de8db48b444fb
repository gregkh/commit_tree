mm: directly use __mlock_vma_pages_range() in find_extend_vma()

In find_extend_vma(), we don't need mlock_vma_pages_range() to verify
the vma type - we know we're working with a stack.  So, we can call
directly into __mlock_vma_pages_range(), and remove the last
make_pages_present() call site.

Note that we don't use mm_populate() here, so we can't release the
mmap_sem while allocating new stack pages.  This is deemed acceptable,
because the stack vmas grow by a bounded number of pages at a time, and
these are anon pages so we don't have to read from disk to populate
them.
