x86, realmode: Set real_mode permissions early

Trampoline code is executed by APs with kernel low mapping on 64bit.
We need to set trampoline code to EXEC early before we boot APs.

Found the problem after switching to #PF handler set page table,
and we do not set initial kernel low mapping with EXEC anymore in
arch/x86/kernel/head_64.S.

Change to use early_initcall instead that will make sure trampoline
will have EXEC set.
