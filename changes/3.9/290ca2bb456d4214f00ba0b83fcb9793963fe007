bnx2x: Allocate VF database in PF when VFs are present

When A PF determines that it may have to manage SRIOV VFs it
allocates a database for this purpose. The database is intended to
keep track of the VF state, the resources allocated for each VF
(queues, interrupt vectors, etc), the state of the VF's queues.
When the VF loads the database is updated accordingly.
When A VF closes the database is consulted to determine which
resources need to be released (close queues against device, reclaim
interrupt vectors, etc).
