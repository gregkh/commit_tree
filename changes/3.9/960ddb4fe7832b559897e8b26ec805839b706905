x86, mm: Align start address to correct big page size

We are going to use buffer in BRK to map small range just under memory top,
and use those new mapped ram to map ram range under it.

The ram range that will be mapped at first could be only page aligned,
but ranges around it are ram too, we could use bigger page to map it to
avoid small page size.

We will adjust page_size_mask in following patch:
	x86, mm: Use big page size for small memory range
to use big page size for small ram range.

Before that patch, this patch will make sure start address to be
aligned down according to bigger page size, otherwise entry in page
page will not have correct value.
