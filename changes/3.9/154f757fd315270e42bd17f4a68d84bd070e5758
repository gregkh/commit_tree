extcon: max77693: Remove duplicate code by making function

duplicate code because almost internal function need to read
adc/adc1k/adclow/chg_type value of MUIC register. Also, this patch
add description of internal function move field constant of muic device
from extcon-max77693 driver to max77693 header file because of it
is needed for masking some interrupt through platform data.
