cfg80211: expand per-station byte counters to 64bit

In per-station statistics, present 32bit counters are too small
for practical purposes - with gigabit speeds, it get overlapped
every few seconds.

Expand counters in the struct station_info to be 64-bit.
Driver can still fill only 32-bit and indicate in @filled
only bits like STATION_INFO_[TR]X_BYTES; in case driver provides
full 64-bit counter, it should also set in @filled
bit STATION_INFO_[TR]RX_BYTES64

Netlink sends both 32-bit and 64-bit counters, if present, to not
break userspace.

[change to also have 32-bit counters if driver advertises 64-bit]
