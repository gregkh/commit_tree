memcg,vmscan: do not break out targeted reclaim without reclaimed pages

Targeted (hard resp soft) reclaim has traditionally tried to scan one
group with decreasing priority until nr_to_reclaim (SWAP_CLUSTER_MAX
pages) is reclaimed or all priorities are exhausted.  The reclaim is
then retried until the limit is met.

This approach, however, doesn't work well with deeper hierarchies where
groups higher in the hierarchy do not have any or only very few pages
(this usually happens if those groups do not have any tasks and they
have only re-parented pages after some of their children is removed).
Those groups are reclaimed with decreasing priority pointlessly as there
is nothing to reclaim from them.

An easiest fix is to break out of the memcg iteration loop in
shrink_zone only if the whole hierarchy has been visited or sufficient
pages have been reclaimed.  This is also more natural because the
reclaimer expects that the hierarchy under the given root is reclaimed.
As a result we can simplify the soft limit reclaim which does its own
iteration.
