workqueue: rename cpu_workqueue to pool_workqueue

workqueue has moved away from global_cwqs to worker_pools and with the
scheduled custom worker pools, wforkqueues will be associated with
pools which don't have anything to do with CPUs.  The workqueue code
went through significant amount of changes recently and mass renaming
isn't likely to hurt much additionally.  Let's replace 'cpu' with
'pool' so that it reflects the current design.

* s/struct cpu_workqueue_struct/struct pool_workqueue/
* s/cpu_wq/pool_wq/
* s/cwq/pwq/

This patch is purely cosmetic.
