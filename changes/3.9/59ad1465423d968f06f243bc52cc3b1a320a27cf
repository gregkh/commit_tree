drm/nouveau: protect evo_wait/evo_kick sections with a channel mutex

With per-crtc locks modeset operations can run in parallel, and the
cursor code uses the device-global evo master channel for hw frobbing.
But the pageflip code can also sync with the master under some
circumstances. Hence just wrap things up in a mutex to ensure that
pushbuf access doesn't intermingle.

The approach here is a bit overkill since the per-crtc channels used
to schedule the pageflips could probably be used without this pushbuf
locking, but I'm not familiar enough with the nouveau codebase to be
sure of that.

v2: Add missing mutex_init to avoid angering lockdep.
