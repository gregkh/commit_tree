serial: rp2: New driver for Comtrol RocketPort 2 cards

This driver supports the RocketPort EXPRESS and RocketPort INFINITY
families of PCI/PCIe multiport serial adapters.  These adapters use a
"RocketPort 2" ASIC that is not compatible with the original RocketPort
driver (CONFIG_ROCKETPORT).

Tested with the RocketPort EXPRESS Octa DB9 and Quad DB9.  Also added an
old RocketPort 8J PCI card to the same system to verify that rocket.c and
rp2.c coexist peacefully.
