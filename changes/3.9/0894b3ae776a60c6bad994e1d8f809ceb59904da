s390/ipl: Implement diag308 loop for zfcpdump

When a zfcpdump is triggered and a second dump on the same CEC is
already in progress for another LPAR, diagnose 308 returns with
an error code until the first dump is finished. Currently the
second Linux stops with a disabled wait PSW in that case.

This is improved now by by triggering diag 308 in a loop until
it works.
