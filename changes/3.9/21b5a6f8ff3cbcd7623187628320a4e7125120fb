e1000e: cosmetic move of #defines to the new 80003es2lan.h

Move #defines specific to the ESB2/82563 family of devices to the new
80003es2lan.h header file.  These defines can be used by other files in the
driver and moving them to the 80003es2lan-family-specific file makes it
clearer to which devices they are applicable.
