x86, mm: kill numa_free_all_bootmem()

Now NO_BOOTMEM version free_all_bootmem_node() does not really
do free_bootmem at all, and it only call register_page_bootmem_info_node
instead.

That is confusing, try to kill that free_all_bootmem_node().

Before that, this patch will remove numa_free_all_bootmem().

That function could be replaced with register_page_bootmem_info() and
free_all_bootmem();
