tracing: Keep overwrite in sync between regular and snapshot buffers

Changing the overwrite mode for the ring buffer via the trace
option only sets the normal buffer. But the snapshot buffer could
swap with it, and then the snapshot would be in non overwrite mode
and the normal buffer would be in overwrite mode, even though the
option flag states otherwise.

Keep the two buffers overwrite modes in sync.
