mm: reduce rmap overhead for ex-KSM page copies created on swap faults

When ex-KSM pages are faulted from swap cache, the fault handler is not
capable of re-establishing anon_vma-spanning KSM pages.  In this case, a
copy of the page is created instead, just like during a COW break.

These freshly made copies are known to be exclusive to the faulting VMA
and there is no reason to go look for this page in parent and sibling
processes during rmap operations.

Use page_add_new_anon_rmap() for these copies.  This also puts them on
the proper LRU lists and marks them SwapBacked, so we can get rid of
doing this ad-hoc in the KSM copy code.
