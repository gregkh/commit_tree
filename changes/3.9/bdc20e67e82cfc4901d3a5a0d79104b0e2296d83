Btrfs: copy everything if we've created an inline extent

I noticed while looking into a tree logging bug that we aren't logging inline
extents properly.  Since this requires copying and it shouldn't happen too often
just force us to copy everything for the inode into the tree log when we have an
inline extent.  With this patch we have valid data after a crash when we write
an inline extent.  Thanks,
