serial/arc-uart: switch to devicetree based probing

* DT binding for arc-uart
* With alll the bits in place we can now use DT probing.

Note that there's a bit of kludge right now because earlyprintk portion
of driver can't use the DT infrastrcuture to get resoures/plat_data.
This requires some infrastructre changes to of_flat_ framework
