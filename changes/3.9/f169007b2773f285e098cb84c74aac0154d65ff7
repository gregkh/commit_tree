cgroup: fail if monitored file and event_control are in different cgroup

If we pass fd of memory.usage_in_bytes of cgroup A to cgroup.event_control
of cgroup B, then we won't get memory usage notification from A but B!

What's worse, if A and B are in different mount hierarchy, we'll end up
accessing NULL pointer!

Disallow this kind of invalid usage.
