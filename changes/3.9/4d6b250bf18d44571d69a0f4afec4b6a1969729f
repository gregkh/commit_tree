libceph: drop snapid in ceph_calc_raw_layout()

A snapshot id must be provided to ceph_calc_raw_layout() even though
it is not needed at all for calculating the layout.

Where the snapshot id *is* needed is when building the request
message for an osd operation.

Drop the snapid parameter from ceph_calc_raw_layout() and pass
that value instead in ceph_osdc_build_request().
