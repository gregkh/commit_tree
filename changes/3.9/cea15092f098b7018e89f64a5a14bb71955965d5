ARM: 7699/1: sched_clock: Add more notrace to prevent recursion

cyc_to_sched_clock() is called by sched_clock() and cyc_to_ns()
is called by cyc_to_sched_clock(). I suspect that some compilers
inline both of these functions into sched_clock() and so we've
been getting away without having a notrace marking. It seems that
my compiler isn't inlining cyc_to_sched_clock() though, so I'm
hitting a recursion bug when I enable the function graph tracer,
causing my system to crash. Marking these functions notrace fixes
it. Technically cyc_to_ns() doesn't need the notrace because it's
already marked inline, but let's just add it so that if we ever
remove inline from that function it doesn't blow up.
