gfs2: Report quotas in the caller's user namespace.

When a quota is queried return the uid or the gid in the mapped into
the caller's user namespace.  In addition perform the munged version
of the mapping so that instead of -1 a value that does not map is
reported as the overflowuid or the overflowgid.
