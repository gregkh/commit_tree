drm/radeon: refactor vline packet parsing function

vline packet parsing function for R600 and Evergreen+ are
the same, except that they use different registers. Factor
out the algorithm into a common function that uses register
table passed from ASIC-specific caller.

This reduces ASIC-specific function to (trivial) setup
of register table and call into the common function.
