uprobes: Change handle_swbp() to expose bp_vaddr to handler_chain()

Change handle_swbp() to set regs->ip = bp_vaddr in advance, this is
what consumer->handler() needs but uprobe_get_swbp_addr() is not
exported.

This also simplifies the code and makes it more consistent across
the supported architectures. handle_swbp() becomes the only caller
of uprobe_get_swbp_addr().
