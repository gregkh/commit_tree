ARM: 7660/1: tlb: add branch predictor maintenance operations

The ARM architecture requires explicit branch predictor maintenance
when updating an instruction stream for a given virtual address. In
reality, this isn't so much of a burden because the branch predictor
is flushed during the cache maintenance required to make the new
instructions visible to the I-side of the processor.

However, there are still some cases where explicit flushing is required,
so add a local_bp_flush_all operation to deal with this.
