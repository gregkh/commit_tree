lockd: nlmclnt_reclaim(): avoid stack overflow

Even though nlmclnt_reclaim() is only one call into the stack frame,
928 bytes on the stack seems like a lot. Recode to dynamically
allocate the request structure once from within the reclaimer task,
then pass this pointer into nlmclnt_reclaim() for reuse on
subsequent calls.

smatch analysis:

fs/lockd/clntproc.c:620 nlmclnt_reclaim() warn: 'reqst' puts
 928 bytes on stack

Also remove redundant assignment of 0 after memset.
