ipc: convert to idr_alloc()

Convert to the much saner new idr interface.

The new interface doesn't directly translate to the way idr_pre_get()
was used around ipc_addid() as preloading disables preemption.  From
my cursory reading, it seems like we should be able to do all
allocation from ipc_addid(), so I moved it there.  Can you please
check whether this would be okay?  If this is wrong and ipc_addid()
should be allowed to be called from non-sleepable context, I'd suggest
allocating id itself in the outer functions and later install the
pointer using idr_replace().
