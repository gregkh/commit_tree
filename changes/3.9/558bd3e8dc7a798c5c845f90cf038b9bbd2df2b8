PM idle: remove global declaration of pm_idle

pm_idle appears in no generic Linux code,
it appears only in architecture-specific code.

Thus, pm_idle should not be declared in pm.h.

Architectures that  use an idle function pointer
should delcare one local to their architecture,
and/or use cpuidle.
