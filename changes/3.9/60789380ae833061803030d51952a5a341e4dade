libdeph: don't export ceph_osdc_init() or ceph_osdc_stop()

The only callers of ceph_osdc_init() and ceph_osdc_stop()
ceph_create_client() and ceph_destroy_client() (respectively)
and they are in the same kernel module as those two functions.
There's therefore no need to export those interfaces, so don't.
