device_cgroup: don't grab mutex in rcu callback

Commit 103a197c0c4e ("security/device_cgroup: lock assert fails in
dev_exception_clean()") grabs devcgroup_mutex to fix assert failure, but
a mutex can't be grabbed in rcu callback.  Since there shouldn't be any
other references when css_free is called, mutex isn't needed for list
cleanup in devcgroup_css_free().
