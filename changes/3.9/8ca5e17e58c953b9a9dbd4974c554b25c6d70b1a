bnx2x: Support of PF driver of a VF acquire request

When a VF is probed by the VF driver, the VF driver sends an
'acquire' request over the VF <-> PF channel for the resources
it needs to operate (interrupts, queues, etc).
The PF driver either ratifies the request and allocates the resources,
responds with the maximum values it will allow the VF to acquire,
or fails the request entirely if there is a problem.
