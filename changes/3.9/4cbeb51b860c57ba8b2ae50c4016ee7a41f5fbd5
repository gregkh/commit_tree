x86, mm: Pagetable level size/shift/mask helpers

I plan to use lookup_address() to walk the kernel pagetables
in a later patch.  It returns a "pte" and the level in the
pagetables where the "pte" was found.  The level is just an
enum and needs to be converted to a useful value in order to
do address calculations with it.  These helpers will be used
in at least two places.

This also gives the anonymous enum a real name so that no one
gets confused about what they should be passing in to these
helpers.

"PTE_SHIFT" was chosen for naming consistency with the other
pagetable levels (PGD/PUD/PMD_SHIFT).
