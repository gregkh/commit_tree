wlcore: remove if_ops from platform_data

We can't pass pointers from the platform data to the modules, because
with DT it cannot be done.  Those pointers are not set by the board
files anyway.  It's the bus modules that set them, so they can be
safely removed from the platform data without changing any board
files.

Create a new structure that the bus modules pass to wlcore.  This
structure contains the if_ops pointers and a pointer to the actual
platform data.
