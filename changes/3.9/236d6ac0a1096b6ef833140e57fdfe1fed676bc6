ARM: mach-imx: Kconfig: Do not select Babbage for MACH_IMX51_DT

When mx51 dt support was added it was necessary to select MACH_MX51_BABBAGE in
order to get the mx51 dt built without errors.

At that time, there was no pinctrl support for mx51 yet.

Currently there is no need to select MACH_MX51_BABBAGE anymore.
