usb: gadget: f_acm: convert to new function interface with backwards compatibility

This patch converts f_acm into a module which uses the new function
interface. It also converts one of its users that is g_serial to make
use of it. The other users of it (g_nokia for instance) are still using
the old include file system and should not notice the change at all. So
they can be converter later independently.
