wl12xx: ignore some of the firmware version fields

The firmware type and the project number fields in the firmware
version number, cannot be checked as if they increase sequentially,
because the former is the firmware type and the latter is an internal
project number.  There's no guarantee that these numbers will remain
incremental, so use WLCORE_FW_VER_IGNORE.
