staging: slicoss: Fix space-related checkpatch.pl warnings

This fixes all instances of
	"Please, no spaces at start of a new line"
	"Please, no spaces before tabs"

Please note that I probably got the warning names wrong,
but they should be close enough for usage here :)

Additional post-commit note: There is one comment on line 230ish in slic.h
that appears to have lost it's formatting. It was fine when I was working
in Geany, but it caught my eye in the below diff. Sorry if it actually happened!
