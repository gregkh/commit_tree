gpiolib: use gpio_chips list in gpiochip_find_base

Re-implement gpiochip_find_base using the list of chips instead of the
global gpio_desc[] array. This makes it both simpler and more efficient,
and is needed to remove the global descriptors array.

The new code should preserve the exact same GPIO number assignment
policy as the code it is replacing. There shouldn't be any visible
change to the assigned GPIO numbers.
