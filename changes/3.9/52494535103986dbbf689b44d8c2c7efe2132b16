rcu: Reduce rcutorture tracing

Currently, rcutorture traces every read-side access.  This can be
problematic because even a two-minute rcutorture run on a two-CPU system
can generate 28,853,363 reads.  Normally, only a failing read is of
interest, so this commit traces adjusts rcutorture's tracing to only
trace failing reads.  The resulting event tracing records the time
and the ->completed value captured at the beginning of the RCU read-side
critical section, allowing correlation with other event-tracing messages.
