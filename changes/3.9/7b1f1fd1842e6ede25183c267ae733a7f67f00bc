NFSv4/4.1: Fix bugs in nfs4[01]_walk_client_list

It is unsafe to use list_for_each_entry_safe() here, because
when we drop the nn->nfs_client_lock, we pin the _current_ list
entry and ensure that it stays in the list, but we don't do the
same for the _next_ list entry. Use of list_for_each_entry() is
therefore the correct thing to do.

Also fix the refcounting in nfs41_walk_client_list().

Finally, ensure that the nfs_client has finished being initialised
and, in the case of NFSv4.1, that the session is set up.
