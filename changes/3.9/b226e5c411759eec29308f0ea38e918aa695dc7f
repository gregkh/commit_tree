cfq-iosched: Print sync-noidle information in blktrace messages

Currently we attach a character "S" or "A" to the cfqq<pid>, to represent
whether queues is sync or async. Add one more character "N" to represent
whether it is sync-noidle queue or sync queue. So now three different
type of queues will look as follows.

cfq1234S   --> sync queus
cfq1234SN  --> sync noidle queue
cfq1234A   --> Async queue

Previously S/A classification was being printed only if group scheduling
was enabled. This patch also makes sure that this classification is
displayed even if group idling is disabled.
