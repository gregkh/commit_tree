qlcnic: avoid mixed mode interrupts for some adapter types

o Some adapter types do not support co-existence of Legacy Interrupt with
  MSI-x or MSI among multiple functions. For those adapters, prevent attaching
  to a function during normal load, if MSI-x or MSI vectors are not available.
o Using module parameters use_msi=0 and use_msi_x=0, driver can be loaded in
  legacy mode for all functions in the adapter.
