KVM: Restrict non-existing slot state transitions

The API documentation states:

	When changing an existing slot, it may be moved in the guest
	physical memory space, or its flags may be modified.

An "existing slot" requires a non-zero npages (memory_size).  The only
transition we should therefore allow for a non-existing slot should be
to create the slot, which includes setting a non-zero memory_size.  We
currently allow calls to modify non-existing slots, which is pointless,
confusing, and possibly wrong.

With this we know that the invalidation path of __kvm_set_memory_region
is always for a delete or move and never for adding a zero size slot.
