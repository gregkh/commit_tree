fs: change return values from -EACCES to -EPERM

According to SUSv3:

[EACCES] Permission denied. An attempt was made to access a file in a way
forbidden by its file access permissions.

[EPERM] Operation not permitted. An attempt was made to perform an operation
limited to processes with appropriate privileges or to the owner of a file
or other resource.

So -EPERM should be returned if capability checks fails.

Strictly speaking this is an API change since the error code user sees is
altered.
