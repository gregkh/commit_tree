staging: comedi: addi_apci_3501: board has an eeprom

The board supported by this driver has an on-board eeprom. Since
we need to read it to get the number of analog output channels,
expose the eeprom as a readable subdevice to the user.

Rename the i_ADDIDATA_InsnReadEeprom() function to give it namespace
associated with the driver.
