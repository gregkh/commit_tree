[media] Move DV-class control IDs from videodev2.h to v4l2-controls.h

When the control IDs were split off from videodev2.h to v4l2-controls.h
these new Digital Video controls were forgotten (the two patches may
have crossed one another).
Move these controls to their proper place in v4l2-controls.h.
