x86, apicv: add virtual x2apic support

basically to benefit from apicv, we need to enable virtualized x2apic mode.
Currently, we only enable it when guest is really using x2apic.

Also, clear MSR bitmap for corresponding x2apic MSRs when guest enabled x2apic:
0x800 - 0x8ff: no read intercept for apicv register virtualization,
               except APIC ID and TMCCT which need software's assistance to
               get right value.
