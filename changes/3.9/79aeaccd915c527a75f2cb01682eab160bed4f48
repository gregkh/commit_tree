net/mlx4_en: Optimize loopback related checks in data path

Currently there are relatively complex conditional checks in the fast path,
for TX loopback enabling and resulting RX filter logic.
Move elaborate if's out of data path, replace them with a single flag
for each state and update that state from appropriate places.
Also, in native (non SRIOV) mode and not in loopback or in selftest,
there is no need to try and filter out packets that HW loopback-ed,
as in native mode we do not loopback packets anymore.
