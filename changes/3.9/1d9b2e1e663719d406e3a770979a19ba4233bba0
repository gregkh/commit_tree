idr: remove length restriction from idr_layer->bitmap

Currently, idr->bitmap is declared as an unsigned long which restricts
the number of bits an idr_layer can contain.  All bitops can handle
arbitrary positive integer bit number and there's no reason for this
restriction.

Declare idr_layer->bitmap using DECLARE_BITMAP() instead of a single
unsigned long.

* idr_layer->bitmap is now an array.  '&' dropped from params to
  bitops.

* Replaced "== IDR_FULL" tests with bitmap_full() and removed
  IDR_FULL.

* Replaced find_next_bit() on ~bitmap with find_next_zero_bit().

* Replaced "bitmap = 0" with bitmap_clear().

This patch doesn't (or at least shouldn't) introduce any behavior
changes.
