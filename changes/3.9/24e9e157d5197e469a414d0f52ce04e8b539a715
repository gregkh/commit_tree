i2c: nomadik: adopt pinctrl support

Amend the I2C nomadik pin controller to optionally take a pin control
handle and set the state of the pins to:

- "default" on boot, resume and before performing an i2c transfer
- "idle" after initial default, after resume default, and after each
   i2c xfer
- "sleep" on suspend()

This should make it possible to optimize energy usage for the pins
both for the suspend/resume cycle, and for runtime cases inbetween
I2C transfers.
