vfio: whitelist pcieport

pcieport does nice things like manage AER and we know it doesn't do
DMA or expose any user accessible devices on the host.  It also keeps
the Memory, I/O, and Busmaster bits enabled, which is pretty handy
when trying to use anyting below it.  Devices owned by pcieport cannot
be given to users via vfio, but we can tolerate them not being owned
by vfio-pci.
