PCI: acpiphp: Move host bridge hotplug to pci_root.c

The acpiphp driver is confusing because it contains partial support for PCI
host bridge hotplug as well as support for hotplug of PCI devices.

This patch moves the host bridge hot-add support to pci_root.c and adds
hot-remove support in pci_root.c.

How to test it: if sci_emu patch is applied, find out root bus number to
ACPI root name mapping from dmesg or /sys.  To remove root bus:

  echo "\_SB.PCIB 3" > /sys/kernel/debug/acpi/sci_notify

To add back root bus:

  echo "\_SB.PCIB 1" > /sys/kernel/debug/acpi/sci_notify
