dmaengine: dw_dmac: Enhance device tree support

dw_dmac driver already supports device tree but it used to have its platform
data passed the non-DT way.

This patch does following changes:
- pass platform data via DT, non-DT way still takes precedence if both are used.
- create generic filter routine
- Earlier slave information was made available by slave specific filter routines
  in chan->private field. Now, this information would be passed from within dmac
  DT node. Slave drivers would now be required to pass bus_id (a string) as
  parameter to this generic filter(), which would be compared against the slave
  data passed from DT, by the generic filter routine.
- Update binding document
