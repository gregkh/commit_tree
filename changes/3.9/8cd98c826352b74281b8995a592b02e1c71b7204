staging: comedi: das08_cs: convert to auto attach

Convert this pcmcia driver to the comedi auto attach mechanism.

This allows getting rid of the "hack" needed to pass the pcmcia_device
pointer from the pcmcia_driver to the comedi_driver.

We still need the boardinfo because the das08 driver uses it. But we
can get rid of the duplicate that allowed attaching with the driver
name.
