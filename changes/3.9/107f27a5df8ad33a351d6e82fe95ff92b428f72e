drm/i915: Open-code i915_gpu_idle() for handling seqno wrapping

The complication is that during seqno wrapping we must be extremely
careful not to write to any ring as that will require a new seqno, and
so would recurse back into the seqno wrap handler. So we cannot call
i915_gpu_idle() as that does additional work beyond simply retiring the
current set of requests, and instead must do the minimal work ourselves
during seqno wrapping.
