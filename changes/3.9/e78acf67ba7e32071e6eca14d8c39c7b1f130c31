kgdb/kgdbts: support ppc64

We can't look up the address of the entry point of the function simply
via that function symbol for all architectures.

For PPC64 ABI, actually there is a function descriptors structure.

A function descriptor is a three doubleword data structure that contains
the following values:
	* The first doubleword contains the address of the entry point of
		the function.
	* The second doubleword contains the TOC base address for
		the function.
	* The third doubleword contains the environment pointer for
		languages such as Pascal and PL/1.

So we should call a wapperred dereference_function_descriptor() to get
the address of the entry point of the function.

Note this is also safe for other architecture after refer to
"include/asm-generic/sections.h" since:

dereference_function_descriptor(p) always is (p) if without arched definition.
