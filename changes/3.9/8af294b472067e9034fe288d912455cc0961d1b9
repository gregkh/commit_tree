ASoC: dapm: Fix handling of loops

Currently if a path loops back on itself we correctly skip over it to
avoid going into an infinite loop but this causes us to ignore the need
to power up the path as we don't count the loop for the purposes of
counting inputs and outputs. This means that internal loopbacks within a
device that have powered devices on them won't be powered up.

Fix this by treating any path that is currently in the process of being
recursed as having a single input or output so that it is counted for
the purposes of power decisions.
