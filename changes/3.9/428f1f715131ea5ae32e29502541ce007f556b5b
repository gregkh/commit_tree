igb: Add timeout for PTP Tx work item

When transmitting a packet that must return a Tx timestamp, a work item
gets scheduled to poll for the Tx timestamp being completed in hardware.
Add a timeout on this work item of 15 seconds from when the driver gets the
skb, after which it will stop polling. Report via stats and system log if
this occurs.
