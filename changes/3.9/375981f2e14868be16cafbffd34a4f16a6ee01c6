spi/s3c64xx: modified error interrupt handling and init

The status of the interrupt is available in the status register,
so reading the clear pending register and writing back the same
value will not actually clear the pending interrupts. This patch
modifies the interrupt handler to read the status register and
clear the corresponding pending bit in the clear pending register.

Modified the hwInit function to clear all the pending interrupts.
