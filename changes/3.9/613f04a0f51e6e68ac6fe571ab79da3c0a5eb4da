tracing: Prevent buffer overwrite disabled for latency tracers

The latency tracers require the buffers to be in overwrite mode,
otherwise they get screwed up. Force the buffers to stay in overwrite
mode when latency tracers are enabled.

Added a flag_changed() method to the tracer structure to allow
the tracers to see what flags are being changed, and also be able
to prevent the change from happing.
