drm/fb-helper: unexport drm_fb_helper_single_fb_probe

Not called by anyone, and really, shouldn't be. Drivers are supposed
either drm_fb_helper_initial_config or drm_fb_helper_hotplug_event.
Originally this was done differently, but is now consolidated in the
helper functions and no longer done by drivers directly.
