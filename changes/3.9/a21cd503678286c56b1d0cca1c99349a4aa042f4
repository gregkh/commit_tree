xfs: refactor space log reservation for XFS_TRANS_ATTR_SET

Currently, we calculate the attribute set transaction
log space reservation at runtime in two parts:

1) XFS_ATTRSET_LOG_RES() which is calcuated out at mount time.

2) ((ext * (mp)->m_sb.sb_sectsize) + \
    (ext * XFS_FSB_TO_B((mp), XFS_BM_MAXLEVELS(mp, XFS_ATTR_FORK))) + \
    (128 * (ext + (ext * XFS_BM_MAXLEVELS(mp, XFS_ATTR_FORK))))))
which is calculated out at runtime since it depend on the given extent length in blocks.

This patch renamed XFS_ATTRSET_LOG_RES(mp) to XFS_ATTRSETM_LOG_RES(mp) to indicate
that it is figured out at mount time.  Introduce XFS_ATTRSETRT_LOG_RES(mp) which would
be used to calculate out the unit of the log space reservation for one block.

In this way, the total runtime space for the given extent length can be figured out by:
XFS_ATTRSETM_LOG_RES(mp) + XFS_ATTRSETRT_LOG_RES(mp) * ext
