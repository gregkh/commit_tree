uprobes: Introduce filter_chain()

Add the new helper filter_chain(). Currently it is only placeholder,
the comment explains what is should do. We will change it later to
consult every consumer to decide whether we need to install the swbp.
Until then it works as if any consumer returns true, this matches the
current behavior.

Change install_breakpoint() to call filter_chain() instead of checking
uprobe->consumers != NULL. We obviously need this, and this equally
closes the race with _unregister().

Change remove_breakpoint() to call this helper too. Currently this is
pointless because remove_breakpoint() is only called when the last
consumer goes away, but we will change this.
