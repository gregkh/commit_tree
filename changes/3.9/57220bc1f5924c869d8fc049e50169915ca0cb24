sound: sequencer: cap array index in seq_chn_common_event()

"chn" here is a number between 0 and 255, but ->chn_info[] only has
16 elements so there is a potential write beyond the end of the
array.

If the seq_mode isn't SEQ_2 then we let the individual drivers
(either opl3.c or midi_synth.c) handle it.  Those functions all
do a bounds check on "chn" so I haven't changed anything here.
The opl3.c driver has up to 18 channels and not 16.
