regulator: tps65090: Fix using wrong dev argument for calling of_regulator_match

The dev parameter is the device requesting the data.
In this case it should be &pdev->dev rather than pdev->dev.parent.

The dev parameter is used to call devm_kzalloc in of_get_regulator_init_data(),
which means this fixes a memory leak because the memory is allocated every time
probe() is called, thus it should be freed when this driver is unloaded.
