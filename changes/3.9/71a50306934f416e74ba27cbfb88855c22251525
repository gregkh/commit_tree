nfsd: disable usermode helper client tracker in container

This tracker uses khelper kthread to execute binaries.
Execution itself is done from kthread context - i.e. global root is used.
This is not suitable for containers with own root.
So, disable this tracker for a while.

Note: one of possible solutions can be pass "init" callback to khelper, which
will swap root to desired one.
