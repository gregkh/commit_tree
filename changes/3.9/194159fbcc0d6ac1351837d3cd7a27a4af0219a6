mm: remove MIGRATE_ISOLATE check in hotpath

Several functions test MIGRATE_ISOLATE and some of those are hotpath but
MIGRATE_ISOLATE is used only if we enable CONFIG_MEMORY_ISOLATION(ie,
CMA, memory-hotplug and memory-failure) which are not common config
option.  So let's not add unnecessary overhead and code when we don't
enable CONFIG_MEMORY_ISOLATION.
