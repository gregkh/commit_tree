Btrfs: fix a mismerge in btrfs_balance()

Raid56 merge (merge commit e942f88) had mistakenly removed a call to
__cancel_balance(), which resulted in balance not cleaning up after itself
after a successful finish.  (Cleanup includes switching the state, removing
the balance item and releasing mut_ex_op testnset lock.)  Bring it back.
