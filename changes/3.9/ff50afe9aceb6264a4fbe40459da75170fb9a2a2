drm/i915: WARN on !crtc in intel_dp_link_down

This could have happened with the old crtc helper based modeset code,
but can't happen any longer with the new code.

Hence put in a WARN and adjust the comment. If no one hits this, we
can eventually remove it (like a few other such cases across our
code).
