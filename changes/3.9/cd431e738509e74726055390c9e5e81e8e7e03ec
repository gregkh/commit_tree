macvlan: add multicast filter

Setting up IPv6 addresses on configurations with many macvlans
is not really working, as many multicast messages are dropped.

Add a multicast filter to macvlan to reduce the amount of cloned
skbs and overhead.

Successfully tested with 1024 macvlans on one ethernet device.
