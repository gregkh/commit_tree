NFC: llcp: integer underflow in nfc_llcp_set_remote_gb()

If gb_len is less than 3 it would cause an integer underflow and
possibly memory corruption in nfc_llcp_parse_gb_tlv().

I removed the old test for gb_len == 0.  I also removed the test for
->remote_gb == NULL.  It's not possible for ->remote_gb to be NULL and
we have already dereferenced ->remote_gb_len so it's too late to test.

The old test return -ENODEV but my test returns -EINVAL.
