tracing: Replace static old_tracer check of tracer name

Currently the trace buffer read functions use a static variable
"old_tracer" for detecting if the current tracer changes. This
was suitable for a single trace file ("trace"), but to add a
snapshot feature that will use the same function for its file,
a check against a static variable is not sufficient.

To use the output functions for two different files, instead of
storing the current tracer in a static variable, as the trace
iterator descriptor contains a pointer to the original current
tracer's name, that pointer can now be used to check if the
current tracer has changed between different reads of the trace
file.
