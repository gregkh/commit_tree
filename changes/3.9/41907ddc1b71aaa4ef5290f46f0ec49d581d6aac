drm/i915: Fix gen2 mappable calculations

When I refactored the code initially, I forgot that gen2 uses a
different bar for the CPU mappable aperture. The agp-less code knows
nothing of generations less than 5, so we have to expand the gtt_probe
function to include the mappable base and end.

It was originally broken by me:
