ext4: add physical block and status member into extent status tree

This commit adds two members in extent_status structure to let it record
physical block and extent status.  Here es_pblk is used to record both
of them because physical block only has 48 bits.  So extent status could
be stashed into it so that we can save some memory.  Now written,
unwritten, delayed and hole are defined as status.

Due to new member is added into extent status tree, all interfaces need
to be adjusted.
