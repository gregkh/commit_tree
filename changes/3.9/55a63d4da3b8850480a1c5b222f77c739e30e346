ALSA: hda - Fix DAC assignment for independent HP

The generic parser should evaluate the availability of the independent
HP when specified.  Otherwise a DAC without the direct connection to
the corresponding pin may be assigned for the HP, but the driver
doesn't check it at all.  The problem was actually seen on some
machines with VT1708s or equivalent codec, where DAC0 is assigned to
HP although it can be connected only via aamix.

This patch adds the badness evaluation for the independent HP to make
it working properly.
