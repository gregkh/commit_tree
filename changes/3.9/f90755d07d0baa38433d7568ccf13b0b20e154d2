ARM: mach-shmobile: armadillo: update defconfig

* Enable ARM_APPENDED_DTB

  Typically the bootloader of an armadillo board does not support DT
  so this option is useful.

* Do not disable SUSPEND

  Suspend seems to work fine on the armadillo

* Enable PM_RUNTIME

  This also seems to work fine.

* Move command line to dts

  This brings us one small step closer to sharing defconfig
  between armadillo and other boards
