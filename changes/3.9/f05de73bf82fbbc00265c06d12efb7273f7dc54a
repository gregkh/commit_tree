skbuff: create skb_panic() function and its wrappers

Create skb_panic() function in lieu of both skb_over_panic() and
skb_under_panic() so that code duplication would be avoided. Update type
and variable name where necessary.

Jiri Pirko suggested using wrappers so that we would be able to keep the
fruits of the original code.
