regmap: Back out work buffer fix

This reverts commit bc8ce4 (regmap: don't corrupt work buffer in
_regmap_raw_write()) since it turns out that it can cause issues when
taken in isolation from the other changes in -next that lead to its
discovery.  On the basis that nobody noticed the problems for quite some
time without that subsequent work let's drop it from v3.9.
