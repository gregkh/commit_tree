fuse: avoid out-of-scope stack access

The all pointers within fuse_req must point to valid memory once
fuse_force_forget() returns.

This bug appeared in "fuse: implement NFS-like readdirplus support"
and was never in any official Linux release.

I tested the fuse_force_forget() code path by injecting to fake -ENOMEM and
verified the FORGET operation was called properly in userspace.
