mmc: dw_mmc: Handle wp-gpios from device tree

On some SoCs (like exynos5250) you need to use an external GPIO for
write protect.  Add support for wp-gpios to the core dw_mmc driver
since it could be useful across multiple SoCs.

With this change I am able to make use of the write protect for the
external SD slot on exynos5250-snow.
