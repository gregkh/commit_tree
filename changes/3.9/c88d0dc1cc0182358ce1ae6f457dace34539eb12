rtlwifi: Initialize rate_init member of struct rate_control_ops

This partially reverts commit 44ba973699b831414c3f8eef68ee5a7fe1208a05.

rate_control_rate_init assumes the rate_init member of
struct rate_control_ops is not NULL therefore not initializing it leads to
an oops as soon the driver succesfully associates to an AP.

The removal of rate_update from 44ba973699b831414c3f8eef68ee5a7fe1208a05
is ok because rate_update is checked for NULL before being
called.
