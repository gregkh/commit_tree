x86, efivars: firmware bug workarounds should be in platform code

Let's not burden ia64 with checks in the common efivars code that we're not
writing too much data to the variable store. That kind of thing is an x86
firmware bug, plain and simple.

efi_query_variable_store() provides platforms with a wrapper in which they can
perform checks and workarounds for EFI variable storage bugs.
