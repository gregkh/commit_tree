proc: Use nd_jump_link in proc_ns_follow_link

Update proc_ns_follow_link to use nd_jump_link instead of just
manually updating nd.path.dentry.

This fixes the BUG_ON(nd->inode != parent->d_inode) reported by Dave
Jones and reproduced trivially with mkdir /proc/self/ns/uts/a.

Sigh it looks like the VFS change to require use of nd_jump_link
happend while proc_ns_follow_link was baking and since the common case
of proc_ns_follow_link continued to work without problems the need for
making this change was overlooked.
