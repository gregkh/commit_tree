rbd: don't retry setting up header watch

When an rbd image is initially mapped a watch event is registered so
we can do something if the header object changes.

The code that does this currently loops if initiating the watch
request results in an ERANGE error.  The osds will never return
ERANGE, so there's no reason to do this loop, so get rid of it.

This resolves:

Note that the problem this loop was intended to solve is a race
between collecting image header information and setting up the watch
on the header object.  The real fix for that problem is described
here:
