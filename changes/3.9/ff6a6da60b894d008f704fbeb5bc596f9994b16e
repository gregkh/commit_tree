mm: accelerate munlock() treatment of THP pages

munlock_vma_pages_range() was always incrementing addresses by PAGE_SIZE
at a time.  When munlocking THP pages (or the huge zero page), this
resulted in taking the mm->page_table_lock 512 times in a row.

We can do better by making use of the page_mask returned by
follow_page_mask (for the huge zero page case), or the size of the page
munlock_vma_page() operated on (for the true THP page case).
