ftrace: Update the kconfig for DYNAMIC_FTRACE

The prompt to enable DYNAMIC_FTRACE (the ability to nop and
enable function tracing at run time) had a confusing statement:

 "enable/disable ftrace tracepoints dynamically"

This was written before tracepoints were added to the kernel,
but now that tracepoints have been added, this is very confusing
and has confused people enough to give wrong information during
presentations.

Not only that, I looked at the help text, and it still references
that dreaded daemon that use to wake up once a second to update
the nop locations and brick NICs, that hasn't been around for over
five years.

Time to bring the text up to the current decade.
