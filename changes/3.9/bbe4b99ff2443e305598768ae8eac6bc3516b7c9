drm/vmwgfx: use drm_modeset_lock_all

Ok, this one here is a bit more complicated, and I can't really claim
to fully understand the locking and lifetime rules of the vmwgfx
driver. So just convert ever mutex_lock call, including the
interruptible one. Since other places (e.g. in the execbuf ioctl) take
the mode_config.mutex without bothering with interruptible handling,
I've figured I should be able to get away with this in a few more
places ...
