ext4: no need to remove extent if len is 0 in ext4_es_remove_extent()

len is 0 means no extent needs to be removed, so return immediately.
Otherwise it could trigger the following BUG_ON() in
ext4_es_remove_extent()

	end = lblk + len - 1;
	BUG_ON(end < lblk);

This could be reproduced by a simple truncate(1) command by an
unprivileged user

	truncate -s $(($((2**32 - 1)) * 4096)) /mnt/ext4/testfile

The same is true for __es_insert_extent().
