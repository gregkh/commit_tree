btrfs: Init io_lock after cloning btrfs device struct

__btrfs_close_devices() clones btrfs device structs with
memcpy(). Some of the fields in the clone are reinitialized, but it's
missing to init io_lock. In mainline this goes unnoticed, but on RT it
leaves the plist pointing to the original about to be freed lock
struct.

Initialize io_lock after cloning, so no references to the original
struct are left.
