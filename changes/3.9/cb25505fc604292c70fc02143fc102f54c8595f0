USB: cdc-acm: fix device unregistration

Unregister tty device in disconnect as is required by the USB stack.

By deferring unregistration to when the last tty reference is dropped,
the parent interface device can get unregistered before the child
resulting in broken hotplug events being generated when the tty is
finally closed:

KERNEL[2290.798128] remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb2/2-1/2-1:3.1 (usb)
KERNEL[2290.804589] remove   /devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7/usb2/2-1 (usb)
KERNEL[2294.554799] remove   /2-1:3.1/tty/ttyACM0 (tty)

The driver must deal with tty callbacks after disconnect by checking the
disconnected flag. Specifically, further opens must be prevented and
this is already implemented.
