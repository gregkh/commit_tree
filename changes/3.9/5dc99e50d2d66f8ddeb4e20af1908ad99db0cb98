ARC: gdbserver using regset interface possibly broken

ptrace regset interface relies on ELF_NGREG for ceiling the size of user
request. So any larger request (even if legit)  would be clipped.

The existing def of ELF_NGREG didn't use user_regs_struct and was
technically one placeholder short (stop_pc) - although the current code
would still work because pt_regs includes a bunch of extra fields,
making
      ELF_NGREG >= sizeof(struct user_regs_struct)/sizeof(long)

But we need to remove this ambiguity, specially since pt_regs should NOT
be directly associated with with anything userspace-ish.
