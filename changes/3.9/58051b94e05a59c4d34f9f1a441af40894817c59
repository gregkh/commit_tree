dm thin: fix non power of two discard granularity calc

Fix a discard granularity calculation to work for non power of 2 block sizes.

In order for thinp to passdown discard bios to the underlying data
device, the data device must have a discard granularity that is a
factor of the thinp block size.  Originally this check was done by
using bitops since the block_size was known to be a power of two.

Introduced by commit f13945d75730081830b6f3360266950e2b7c9067
("dm thin: support a non power of 2 discard_granularity").
