net: cacheline adjust struct netns_frags for better frag performance

This small cacheline adjustment of struct netns_frags improves
performance significantly for the fragmentation code.

Struct members 'lru_list' and 'mem' are both hot elements, and it
hurts performance, due to cacheline bouncing at every call point,
when they share a cacheline.  Also notice, how mem is placed
together with 'high_thresh' and 'low_thresh', as they are used in
the compare operations together.
