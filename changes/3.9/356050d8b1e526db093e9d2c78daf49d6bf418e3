USB: cypress_m8: fix use-after-free in TIOCMIWAIT

Use the port wait queue and make sure to check the serial disconnected
flag before accessing private port data after waking up.

This is is needed as the private port data (including the wait queue
itself) can be gone when waking up after a disconnect.

Also remove bogus test for private data pointer being NULL as it is
never assigned in the loop.
