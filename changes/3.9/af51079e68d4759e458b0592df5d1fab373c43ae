mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: support 8bit mode

The i.MX esdhc has a nonstandard bit layout for the SDHCI_HOST_CONTROL
register. To support 8bit bus width on i.MX populate the platform_bus_width
callback. This is tested on an i.MX25, but should according to the datasheets
work on the other i.MX using this hardware aswell. The i.MX6, while having
a SDHCI_SPEC_300 controller, still uses the same nonstandard register layout.
