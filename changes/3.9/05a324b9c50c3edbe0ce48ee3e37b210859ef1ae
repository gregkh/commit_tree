net: ipv4: reset check_lifetime_work after changing lifetime

This will result in calling check_lifetime in nearest opportunity and
that function will adjust next time to call check_lifetime correctly.
Without this, check_lifetime is called in time computed by previous run,
not affecting modified lifetime.
