dm thin: remove cells from stack

This patch takes advantage of the new bio-prison interface where the
memory is now passed in rather than using a mempool in bio-prison.
This allows the map function to avoid performing potentially-blocking
allocations that could lead to deadlocks: We want to avoid the cell
allocation that is done in bio_detain.

(The potential for mempool deadlocks still remains in other functions
that use bio_detain.)
