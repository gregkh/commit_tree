ALSA: usb-audio: support delay calculation on capture streams

Enable delay report on capture path. The delay is reset when an
URB is retired and increment at each call to .pointer based
on frame counter changes. The precision of the delay
information is limited to 1ms as in the playback case.

This reverts commit 3f94fad09538ec988919ec3f371841182df71d04.
