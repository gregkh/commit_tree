net: Split core bits of netdev_pick_tx into __netdev_pick_tx

This change splits the core bits of netdev_pick_tx into a separate function.
The main idea behind this is to make this code accessible to select queue
functions when they decide to process the standard path instead of their
own custom path in their select queue routine.
