[media] rc: Make probe cleanup goto labels more verbose

Before, labels were simply numbered. Now, the labels are named after the
cleanup action they'll perform (first), based on how the winbond-cir
driver does it. This makes the code a bit more clear and makes changes
in the ordering of labels easier to review.
This change is applied only to the rc drivers that do significant
cleanup in their probe functions: ati-remote, ene-ir, fintek-cir,
gpio-ir-recv, ite-cir, nuvoton-cir.
This commit should not change any code, it just renames goto labels.

[mchehab@redhat.com: removed changes at gpio-ir-recv.c, due to
 merge conflicts]
