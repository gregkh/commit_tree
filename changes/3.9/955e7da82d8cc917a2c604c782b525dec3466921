staging: ced1401: fix GFP_KERNEL in spinlock context

Allowi() calls usb_submit_urb(pdx->pUrbCharIn, bInCallback ? GFP_ATOMIC : GFP_KERNEL)
under spin_lock_irqsave(&pdx->charInLock, flags). That means it should use GFP_ATOMIC anyway.
As soon as it is the only usage of bInCallback argument, the patch removes it at all.
