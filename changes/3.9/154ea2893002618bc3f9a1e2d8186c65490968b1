Btrfs: enforce min_bytes parameter during extent allocation

Commit 24542bf7ea5e4fdfdb5157ff544c093fa4dcb536 changed preallocation of
extents to cap the max size we try to allocate.  It's a valid change,
but the extent reservation code is also used by balance, and that
can't tolerate a smaller extent being allocated.

__btrfs_prealloc_file_range already has a min_size parameter, which is
used by relocation to request a specific extent size.  This commit
adds an extra check to enforce that minimum extent size.
