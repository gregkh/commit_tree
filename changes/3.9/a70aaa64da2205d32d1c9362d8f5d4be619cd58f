mmc: dw_mmc: Add "disable-wp" device tree property

The "disable-wp" property is used to specify that a given SD card slot
doesn't have a concept of write protect.  This eliminates the need for
special case code for SD slots that should never be write protected
(like a micro SD slot or a dev board).

The dw_mmc driver is special in needing to specify "disable-wp"
because the lack of a "wp-gpios" property means to use the special
purpose write protect line.  On some other mmc devices the lack of
"wp-gpios" means that write protect should be disabled.
