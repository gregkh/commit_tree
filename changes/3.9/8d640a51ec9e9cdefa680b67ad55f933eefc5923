dma-debug: fix locking bug in check_unmap()

In check_unmap() it is possible to get into a dead-locked state if
dma_mapping_error is called.  The problem is that the bucket is locked in
check_unmap, and locked again by debug_dma_mapping_error which is called
by dma_mapping_error.  To resolve that we must release the lock on the
bucket before making the call to dma_mapping_error.
