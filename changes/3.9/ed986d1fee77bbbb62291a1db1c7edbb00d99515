[media] meye: convert to the control framework

Convert the meye driver to the control framework. Some private controls
have been replaced with standardized controls (SHARPNESS and JPEGQUAL).
The AGC control looks like it can be replaced by the AUTOGAIN control, but
it isn't a boolean so I do not know how to interpret it.
The FRAMERATE control looks like it can be replaced by S_PARM, but again,
without knowing how to interpret it I decided to leave it alone.
