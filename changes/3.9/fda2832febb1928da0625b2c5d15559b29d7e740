btrfs: cleanup for open-coded alignment

Though most of the btrfs codes are using ALIGN macro for page alignment,
there are still some codes using open-coded alignment like the
following:
------
        u64 mask = ((u64)root->stripesize - 1);
        u64 ret = (val + mask) & ~mask;
------
Or even hidden one:
------
        num_bytes = (end - start + blocksize) & ~(blocksize - 1);
------

Sometimes these open-coded alignment is not so easy to understand for
newbie like me.

This commit changes the open-coded alignment to the ALIGN macro for a
better readability.

Also there is a previous patch from David Sterba with similar changes,
but the patch is for 3.2 kernel and seems not merged.
