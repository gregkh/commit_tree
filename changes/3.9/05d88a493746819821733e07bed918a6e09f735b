asm-generic: uaccess: Allow arches to over-ride __{get,put}_user_fn()

As of now these default to calling the arch provided __copy_{to,from}_user()
routines which being general purpose (w.r.t buffer alignment and lengths)
would lead to alignment checks in generated code (for arches which don't
support unaligned load/stores).

Given that in this case we already know that data involved is "unit"
sized and aligned, using the vanilla copy backend is a bit wasteful.

This change thus allows arches to over-ride the aforementioned routines.
