net: phy: remove flags argument from phy_{attach, connect, connect_direct}

The flags argument of the phy_{attach,connect,connect_direct} functions
is then used to assign a struct phy_device dev_flags with its value.
All callers but the tg3 driver pass the flag 0, which results in the
underlying PHY drivers in drivers/net/phy/ not being able to actually
use any of the flags they would set in dev_flags. This patch gets rid of
the flags argument, and passes phydev->dev_flags to the internal PHY
library call phy_attach_direct() such that drivers which actually modify
a phy device dev_flags get the value preserved for use by the underlying
phy driver.
