staging: comedi: pcm_common: remove module

This module is built whenever CONFIG_COMEDI is enabled but it is
only used by the pcmmio and pcmuio drivers. The pcm_common module
consists of one exported function. Put a local copy of the function
in the pcmmio and pcmuio drivers.

This removes the need for the pcm_common module and the now unused
pcm_common.[ch] files can be deleted and removed from the Makefile.
