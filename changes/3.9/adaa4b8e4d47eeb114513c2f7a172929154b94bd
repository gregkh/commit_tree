Btrfs: fix EIO from btrfs send in is_extent_unchanged for punched holes

When you take a snapshot, punch a hole where there has been data, then take
another snapshot and try to send an incremental stream, btrfs send would
give you EIO. That is because is_extent_unchanged had no support for holes
being punched. With this patch, instead of returning EIO we just return
0 (== the extent is not unchanged) and we're good.
