irq_work: Warn if there's still work on cpu_down

If we are in nohz and there's still irq_work to be done when the idle
task is about to go offline, give a nasty warning. Everything should
have been flushed from the CPU_DYING notifier already. Further attempts
to enqueue an irq_work are buggy because irqs are disabled by
__cpu_disable(). The best we can do is to report the issue to the user.
