regmap: irq: Use a bulk read for interrupt status where possible

If the interrupt status registers are a single block of registers and the
chip supports bulk reads then do a single bulk read rather than pay the
extra I/O cost. This restores the original behaviour which was lost when
support for register striding was added.
