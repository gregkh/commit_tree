ARM: tegra: swap cache-/interrupt-ctrlr nodes in DT

This ensures nodes are sorted in order of reg address. This makes it
easier to compare against e.g. the U-Boot device trees, and is simply
consistent and clean.

While we're at it, remove the unit address from the cache-controller
node name, since it's unique without it.
