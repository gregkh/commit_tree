cfq-iosched: implement cfq_group->nr_active and ->children_weight

To prepare for blkcg hierarchy support, add cfqg->nr_active and
->children_weight.  cfqg->nr_active counts the number of active cfqgs
at the cfqg's level and ->children_weight is sum of weights of those
cfqgs.  The level covers itself (cfqg->leaf_weight) and immediate
children.

The two values are updated when a cfqg enters and leaves the group
service tree.  Unless the hierarchy is very deep, the added overhead
should be negligible.

Currently, the parent is determined using cfqg_flat_parent() which
makes the root cfqg the parent of all other cfqgs.  This is to make
the transition to hierarchy-aware scheduling gradual.  Scheduling
logic will be converted to use cfqg->children_weight without actually
changing the behavior.  When everything is ready,
blkcg_weight_parent() will be replaced with proper parent function.

This patch doesn't introduce any behavior chagne.

v2: s/cfqg->level_weight/cfqg->children_weight/ as per Vivek.
