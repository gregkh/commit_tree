MIPS: early_printk: drop __init annotations

We cannot use __init for earlyprintk code or data, since the kernel
parameter "keep_bootcon" allows leaving the boot console enabled.

Currently MIPS will crash/hang/die if you use keep_bootcon. The patch
fixes it at least on Lemote FuLoong mini-PC. Changes for other boards
were done based on what I could find with grep...
