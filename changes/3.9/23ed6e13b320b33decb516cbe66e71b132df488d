rbd: ignore result of ceph_copy_from_page_vector()

The result of ceph_copy_from_page_vector() is simply the length
argument it is provided.

This is called by rbd_obj_method_sync(), which returns the result if
it's non-negative.  But we always either ignore or overwrite that
return value.  So explicitly ignore what's returned by the copy
function, and have rbd_obj_method_sync() always return either a
negative errno or 0.

We also return the result of ceph_copy_from_page_vector() in
rbd_obj_read_sync().  There we still want to return the number of
bytes transferred, but we can use the value we already have in hand
rather than what ceph_copy_from_page_vector() provides.
