mfd: arizona: Disable interrupts during resume

Runtime power management does not function during system suspend but the
Arizona devices need to use runtime power management to power up the device
in order to handle interrupts. Try to avoid interrupts firing during
resume by disabling the primary IRQ before interrupts are reenabled on
resume and only reenabling it again during main resume.

The goal is to avoid issues in the situation where an interrupt is asserted
during resume (eg, due to it being the wake source) and the interrupt
handling gets scheduled prior to the device being able to handle runtime
PM.
