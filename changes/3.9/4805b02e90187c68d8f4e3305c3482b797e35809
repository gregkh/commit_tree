mm/mlock.c: document scary-looking stack expansion mlock chain

The fact that mlock calls get_user_pages, and get_user_pages might call
mlock when expanding a stack looks like a potential recursion.

However, mlock makes sure the requested range is already contained
within a vma, so no stack expansion will actually happen from mlock.

Should this ever change: the stack expansion mlocks only the newly
expanded range and so will not result in recursive expansion.
