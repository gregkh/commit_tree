x86: Do not try to sync identity map for non-mapped pages

kernel_map_sync_memtype() is called from a variety of contexts.  The
pat.c code that calls it seems to ensure that it is not called for
non-ram areas by checking via pat_pagerange_is_ram().  It is important
that it only be called on the actual identity map because there *IS*
no map to sync for highmem pages, or for memory holes.

The ioremap.c uses are not as careful as those from pat.c, and call
kernel_map_sync_memtype() on PCI space which is in the middle of the
kernel identity map _range_, but is not actually mapped.

This patch adds a check to kernel_map_sync_memtype() which probably
duplicates some of the checks already in pat.c.  But, it is necessary
for the ioremap.c uses and shouldn't hurt other callers.

I have reproduced this bug and this patch fixes it for me and the
original bug reporter:
