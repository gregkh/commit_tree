TPM: Issue TPM_STARTUP at driver load if the TPM has not been started

The TPM will respond to TPM_GET_CAP with TPM_ERR_INVALID_POSTINIT if
TPM_STARTUP has not been issued. Detect this and automatically
issue TPM_STARTUP.

This is for embedded applications where the kernel is the first thing
to touch the TPM.
