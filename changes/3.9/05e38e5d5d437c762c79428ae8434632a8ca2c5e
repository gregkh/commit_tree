Bisecting found the following patch caused it:

commit 44e9309f1f357794b7ae93d5f3e3e6f11d2b8a7f
Author: Haren Myneni <haren@linux.vnet.ibm.com>
powerpc: Implement PPR save/restore

It was found this patch corrupted r9 when calling
SET_DEFAULT_THREAD_PPR()

Using r10 as a scratch register instead of r9 solved the problem.
