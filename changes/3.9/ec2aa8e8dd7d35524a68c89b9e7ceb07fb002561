userns: Allow the userns root to mount of devpts

- The context in which devpts is mounted has no effect on the creation
  of ptys as the /dev/ptmx interface has been used by unprivileged
  users for many years.

- Only support unprivileged mounts in combination with the newinstance
  option to ensure that mounting of /dev/pts in a user namespace will
  not allow the options of an existing mount of devpts to be modified.

- Create /dev/pts/ptmx as the root user in the user namespace that
  mounts devpts so that it's permissions to be changed.
