mm: add & use zone_end_pfn() and zone_spans_pfn()

Add 2 helpers (zone_end_pfn() and zone_spans_pfn()) to reduce code
duplication.

This also switches to using them in compaction (where an additional
variable needed to be renamed), page_alloc, vmstat, memory_hotplug, and
kmemleak.

Note that in compaction.c I avoid calling zone_end_pfn() repeatedly
because I expect at some point the sycronization issues with start_pfn &
spanned_pages will need fixing, either by actually using the seqlock or
clever memory barrier usage.
