metag: copy devicetree to non-init memory

Make a copy of the device tree blob in non-init memory. It is required
when using built-in device tree files that the platform code copies the
blob to non-init memory prior to calling unflatten_device_tree(),
otherwise the strings that the device tree refer to will get poisoned
and potentially reused, breaking later reading of the device tree
post-init (such as compatible matching in modules, debugfs, and the
procfs interface).
