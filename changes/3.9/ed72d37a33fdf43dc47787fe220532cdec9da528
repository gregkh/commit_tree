[media] media: Add 0x3009 USB PID to ttusb2 driver (fixed diff)

The "Technisat SkyStar USB plus" is a TT-connect S-2400 clone, which the
V4L-DVB drivers already support. However, some of these devices (like
mine) come with a different USB PID 0x3009 instead of 0x3006.

There have already been patches simply overwriting the USB PID in
dvb-usb-ids.h. Of course these patches were rejected because they would
have disabled the 0x3006 PID.

This new patch adds the 0x3009 PID to dvb-usb-ids.h, and adds references
to it within the ttusb2.c driver. PID 0x3006 devices will continue to work.

The only difference between the two hardware models seems to be the
EEPROM chip. In fact, Windows BDA driver names the 0x3009 device with a
"(8 kB EEPROM)" suffix. In spite of that, the 0x3009 device works
absolutely flawlessly using the existing ttusb2 driver.
