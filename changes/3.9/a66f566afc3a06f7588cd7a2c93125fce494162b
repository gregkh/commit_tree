drivers/net: Clean up orphaned probes in Space.c

The removal of the 8390 EISA drivers actually comprises the
complete content of the EISA probe block, so we can now remove
that block, and its hook into the unified probe.  Note that
the deleted comment mentions PCI probes, but they long since
moved elsewhere, so no PCI probes are touched here.

We get rid of the orphaned EISA probe prototypes, and a couple
of left over MCA probe prototypes at the same time.
