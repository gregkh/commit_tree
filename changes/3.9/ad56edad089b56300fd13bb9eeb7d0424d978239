jbd2: fix use after free in jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata()

jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() didn't get a reference to journal_head it
was working with. This is OK in most of the cases since the journal head
should be attached to a transaction but in rare occasions when we are
journalling data, __ext4_journalled_writepage() can race with
jbd2_journal_invalidatepage() stripping buffers from a page and thus
journal head can be freed under hands of jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata().

Fix the problem by getting own journal head reference in
jbd2_journal_dirty_metadata() (and also in jbd2_journal_set_triggers()
which can possibly have the same issue).
