powerpc: Define differences between doorbells on book3e and book3s

There are a few key differences between doorbells on server compared
with embedded that we care about on Linux, namely:

- We have a new msgsndp instruction for directed privileged doorbells.
  msgsnd is used for directed hypervisor doorbells.
- The tag we use in the instruction is the Thread Identification
  Register of the recipient thread (since server doorbells can only
  occur between threads within a single core), and is only 7 bits wide.
- A new message type is introduced for server doorbells (none of the
  existing book3e message types are currently supported on book3s).
