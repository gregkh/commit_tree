NFC: Changed event_received hci ops result semantic

Some chips use a standard HCI event code, destined to a proprietary
gate, with a different meaning. Therefore, the HCI driver must always
have a chance to intercept the event before standard processing is
attempted.
The new semantic specifies that the result value "1" means that the
driver doesn't especially handle the event. result <= 0 means it was
handled.
