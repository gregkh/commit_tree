ALSA: core: don't return uninitialized snd_compr_tstamp

The snd_compr_update_tstamp() can only fill in the snd_compr_tstamp
if the codec implements the pointer() function. If that happened
the code was previously returning uninitialized garbage in the
tstamp because it wasn't initialized anywhere.

This change zero-fills the tstamp in the two places it is used
before calling snd_compr_update_tstamp(), and also has
snd_compr_update_tstamp() return an error indication if it
can't provide a tstamp. For the case of snd_compr_calc_avail()
it ignores this error because we still need to return info on
the available buffer space even if we can't provide tstamp
info - when the tstamp is not valid all fields are now
guaranteed to be zero.
