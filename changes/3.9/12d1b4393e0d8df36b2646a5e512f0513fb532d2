idr: remove _idr_rc_to_errno() hack

idr uses -1, IDR_NEED_TO_GROW and IDR_NOMORE_SPACE to communicate
exception conditions internally.  The return value is later translated
to errno values using _idr_rc_to_errno().

This is confusing.  Drop the custom ones and consistently use -EAGAIN
for "tree needs to grow", -ENOMEM for "need more memory" and -ENOSPC for
"ran out of ID space".

Due to the weird memory preloading mechanism, [ra]_get_new*() return
-EAGAIN on memory shortage, so we need to substitute -ENOMEM w/
-EAGAIN on those interface functions.  They'll eventually be cleaned
up and the translations will go away.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
