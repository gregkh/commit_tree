x86, mm: Move init_memory_mapping calling out of setup.c

Now init_memory_mapping is called two times, later will be called for every
ram ranges.

Could put all related init_mem calling together and out of setup.c.

Actually, it reverts commit 1bbbbe7
    x86: Exclude E820_RESERVED regions and memory holes above 4 GB from direct mapping.
will address that later with complete solution include handling hole under 4g.
