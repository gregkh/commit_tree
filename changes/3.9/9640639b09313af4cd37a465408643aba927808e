mmc: dw_mmc: Remove DW_MCI_QUIRK_NO_WRITE_PROTECT

The original quirk was added in the change 'mmc: dw_mmc: add quirk to
indicate missing write protect line'.  The original quirk was added at
a controller level even though each slot has its own write protect (so
the quirk should be at the slot level).  A recent change (mmc: dw_mmc:
Add "disable-wp" device tree property) added a slot-level quirk and
support for the quirk directly to dw_mmc.
