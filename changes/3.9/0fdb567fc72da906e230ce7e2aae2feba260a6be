dw_dmac: store direction in the custom channel structure

Currently the direction value comes from the generic slave configuration
structure and explicitly as a preparation function parameter. The first one is
kinda obsoleted. Thus, we have to store the value passed to the preparation
function somewhere in our structures to be able to use it later. The best
candidate to provide the storage is a custom channel structure. Until now we
still keep and check the direction field of the slave config structure as well.
