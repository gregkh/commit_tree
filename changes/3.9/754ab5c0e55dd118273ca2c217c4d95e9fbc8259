staging: comedi: disallow COMEDI_DEVCONFIG on non-board minors

Comedi has two sorts of minor devices:
(a) normal board minor devices in the range 0 to
COMEDI_NUM_BOARD_MINORS-1 inclusive; and
(b) special subdevice minor devices in the range COMEDI_NUM_BOARD_MINORS
upwards that are used to open the same underlying comedi device as the
normal board minor devices, but with non-default read and write
subdevices for asynchronous commands.

The special subdevice minor devices get created when a board supporting
asynchronous commands is attached to a normal board minor device, and
destroyed when the board is detached from the normal board minor device.
One way to attach or detach a board is by using the COMEDI_DEVCONFIG
ioctl.  This should only be used on normal board minors as the special
subdevice minors are too ephemeral.  In particular, the change
introduced in commit 7d3135af399e92cf4c9bbc5f86b6c140aab3b88c ("staging:
comedi: prevent auto-unconfig of manually configured devices") breaks
horribly for special subdevice minor devices.

Since there's no legitimate use for the COMEDI_DEVCONFIG ioctl on a
special subdevice minor device node, disallow it and return -ENOTTY.
