Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _VENDOR_SECTION_INFO and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _VENDOR_SECTION_INFO, and
changes the name of the struct to bcm_vendor_section_info.
In addition, any calls to typedefs VENDOR_SECTION_INFO, or
*PVENDOR_SECTION_INFO are changed to call the struct
directly.
