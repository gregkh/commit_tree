rcu: Allow TREE_PREEMPT_RCU on UP systems

The TINY_PREEMPT_RCU is complex, does not provide that much memory
savings, and therefore TREE_PREEMPT_RCU should be used instead.  The
systems where the difference between TINY_PREEMPT_RCU and TREE_PREEMPT_RCU
are quite small compared to the memory footprint of CONFIG_PREEMPT.

This commit therefore takes a first step towards eliminating
TINY_PREEMPT_RCU by allowing TREE_PREEMPT_RCU to be configured on !SMP
systems.
