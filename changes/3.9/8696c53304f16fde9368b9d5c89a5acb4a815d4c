Btrfs: fix memory leak of pending_snapshot->inherit

The argument "inherit" of btrfs_ioctl_snap_create_transid() was assigned
to NULL during we created the snapshots, so we didn't free it though we
called kfree() in the caller.

But since we are sure the snapshot creation is done after the function -
btrfs_ioctl_snap_create_transid() - completes, it is safe that we don't
assign the pointer "inherit" to NULL, and just free it in the caller of
btrfs_ioctl_snap_create_transid(). In this way, the code can become more
readable.
