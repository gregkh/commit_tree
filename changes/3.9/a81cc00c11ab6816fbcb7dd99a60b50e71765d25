drm/i915: Cut out the infamous ILK w/a from AGP layer

And, move it to where the rest of the logic is.

There is some slight functionality changes. There was extra paranoid
checks in AGP code making sure we never do idle maps on gen2 parts. That
was not duplicated as the simple PCI id check should do the right thing.

v2: use IS_GEN5 && IS_MOBILE check instead. For now, this is the same as
IS_IRONLAKE_M but is more future proof. The workaround docs hint that
more than one platform may be effected, but we've never seen such a
platform in the wild. (Rodrigo, Daniel)
