dm bio prison: pass cell memory in

Change the dm_bio_prison interface so that instead of allocating memory
internally, dm_bio_detain is supplied with a pre-allocated cell each
time it is called.

This enables a subsequent patch to move the allocation of the struct
dm_bio_prison_cell outside the thin target's mapping function so it can
no longer block there.
