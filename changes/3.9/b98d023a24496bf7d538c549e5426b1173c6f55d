fuse: pass iov[] to fuse_get_user_pages()

The patch makes preliminary work for the next patch optimizing scatter-gather
direct IO. The idea is to allow fuse_get_user_pages() to pack as many iov-s
to each fuse request as possible. So, here we only rework all related
call-paths to carry iov[] from fuse_direct_IO() to fuse_get_user_pages().
