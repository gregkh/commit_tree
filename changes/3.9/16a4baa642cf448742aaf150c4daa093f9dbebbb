x86, boot: Move checking of cmd_line_ptr out of common path

cmdline.c::__cmdline_find_option... are shared between 16-bit setup code
and 32/64 bit decompressor code.

for 32/64 only path via kexec, we should not check if ptr is less 1M.
as those cmdline could be put above 1M, or even 4G.

Move out accessible checking out of __cmdline_find_option()
So decompressor in misc.c can parse cmdline correctly.
