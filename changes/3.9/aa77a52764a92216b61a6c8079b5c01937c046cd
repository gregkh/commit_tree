cpufreq: acpi-cpufreq: Don't set policy->related_cpus from .init()

With the addition of following patch:

fcf8058 cpufreq: Simplify cpufreq_add_dev()

cpufreq driver's .init() routine must initialize policy->cpus with
mask of all possible CPUs (Online + Offline) that share the clock.
Then the core would copy this mask onto policy->related_cpus and will
reset policy->cpus to carry only online cpus.

acpi-cpufreq driver wasn't updated with this assumption and so
sometimes when we try to hot[un]plug CPUs at run time, sysfs
directories get corrupted.

This patch fixes acpi-cpufreq driver against this corruption.
