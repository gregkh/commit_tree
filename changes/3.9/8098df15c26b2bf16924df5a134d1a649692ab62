ARM: mach-shmobile: kzm9d: update defconfig

* Do not disable SUSPEND

  Suspend seems to work fine on the kzm9d.

  This is part of an effort reduce differences between mach-shmobile
  defconfigs with a view to using a common defconfig.

* Enable PM_RUNTIME

  This also seems to work fine on the kzm9d.

  This is part of an effort reduce differences between mach-shmobile
  defconfigs with a view to using a common defconfig.

* Move kernel command line from defconfig to dts.

  This brings us one small step closer to sharing defconfig
  between kzm9d and other boards.
