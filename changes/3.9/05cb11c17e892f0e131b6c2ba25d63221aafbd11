ceph: Translate between uid and gids in cap messages and kuids and kgids

- Make the uid and gid arguments of send_cap_msg() used to compose
  ceph_mds_caps messages of type kuid_t and kgid_t.

- Pass inode->i_uid and inode->i_gid in __send_cap to send_cap_msg()
  through variables of type kuid_t and kgid_t.

- Modify struct ceph_cap_snap to store uids and gids in types kuid_t
  and kgid_t.  This allows capturing inode->i_uid and inode->i_gid in
  ceph_queue_cap_snap() without loss and pssing them to
  __ceph_flush_snaps() where they are removed from struct
  ceph_cap_snap and passed to send_cap_msg().

- In handle_cap_grant translate uid and gids in the initial user
  namespace stored in struct ceph_mds_cap into kuids and kgids
  before setting inode->i_uid and inode->i_gid.
