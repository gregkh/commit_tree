EISA/PCI: Init EISA early, before PNP

Matthew reported kernels fail the pci_eisa probe and are later successful
with the virtual_eisa_root_init force probe without slot0.

The reason for that is: PNP probing is before pci_eisa_init gets called
as pci_eisa_init is called via pci_driver.

pnp 00:0f has 0xc80 - 0xc84 reserved.
[    9.700409] pnp 00:0f: [io  0x0c80-0x0c84]

so eisa_probe will fail from pci_eisa_init
				==>eisa_root_register
					==>eisa_probe path.
as force_probe is not set in pci_eisa_root, it will bail early when
slot0 is not probed and initialized.

Try to use subsys_initcall_sync instead, and will keep following sequence:
	pci_subsys_init
	pci_eisa_init_early
	pnpacpi_init/isapnp_init

After this patch EISA can be initialized properly, and PNP overlapping
resource will not be reserved.
[   10.104434] system 00:0f: [io  0x0c80-0x0c84] could not be reserved
