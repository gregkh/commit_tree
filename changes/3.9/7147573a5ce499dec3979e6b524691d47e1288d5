drm/gma500: move fbcon restore to lastclose

Doing this within the fb->destroy callback leads to a locking
nightmare. And all other drm drivers that restore the fbcon do
it in lastclose, too.

With this adjustments all fb->destroy callbacks optionally drop
references to any gem objects used as backing storage, call
drm_framebuffer_cleanup and then kfree the struct. Which nicely
simplifies the locking for framebuffer unreferencing and freeing,
since this doesn't require that we hold the mode_config lock. A
slight exception is the vmwgfx surface backed framebuffer, it also
calls drm_master_put and removes the object from a device-private
framebuffer list. Both seem to have solid locking in place already.

Conclusion is that now it is no longer required to hold the
mode_config lock while freeing a framebuffer.

v2: Drop the corresponding mutex_lock WARN check from
drm_framebuffer_unreference.

v3: Use just the mode_config lock not modeset_lock_all, due to patch
reordering.
