drm/nouveau: fix regression in vblanking

nv50_vblank_enable/disable got switched from NV50_PDISPLAY_INTR_EN_1_VBLANK_CRTC_0 (4) << head to 1 << head, which is wrong.

4 << head is the correct value.

Fixes regression with vblanking since 1d7c71a3e2f77 "drm/nouveau/disp: port vblank handling to event interface"
