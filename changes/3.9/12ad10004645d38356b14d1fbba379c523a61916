clockevents: Add generic timer broadcast function

Currently, the timer broadcast mechanism is defined by a function
pointer on struct clock_event_device. As the fundamental mechanism for
broadcast is architecture-specific, this means that clock_event_device
drivers cannot be shared across multiple architectures.

This patch adds an (optional) architecture-specific function for timer
tick broadcast, allowing drivers which may require broadcast
functionality to be shared across multiple architectures.
