ARM: mach-shmobile: kzm9g: defconfig update

* Enable ARM_APPENDED_DTB

  Typically the bootloader of a kzm9g board does not support DT
  so this option is useful.

* Use voltage regulators by default

* Move command line to dts

  This brings us one small step closer to sharing defconfig
  between kzm9g and other boards
