rbd: don't leak rbd_req for rbd_req_sync_notify_ack()

When rbd_req_sync_notify_ack() calls rbd_do_request() it supplies
rbd_simple_req_cb() as its callback function.  Because the callback
is supplied, an rbd_req structure gets allocated and populated so it
can be used by the callback.  However rbd_simple_req_cb() is not
freeing (or even using) the rbd_req structure, so it's getting
leaked.

Since rbd_simple_req_cb() has no need for the rbd_req structure,
just avoid allocating one for this case.  Of the three calls to
rbd_do_request(), only the one from rbd_do_op() needs the rbd_req
structure, and that call can be distinguished from the other two
because it supplies a non-null rbd_collection pointer.

So fix this leak by only allocating the rbd_req structure if a
non-null "coll" value is provided to rbd_do_request().
