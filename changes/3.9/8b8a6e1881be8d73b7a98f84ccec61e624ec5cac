block/partitions/efi.c: ensure that the GPT header is at least the size of the structure.

UEFI 2.3.1D will include a change to the spec language mandating that a
GPT header must be greater than *or equal to* the size of the defined
structure.  While verifying that this would work on Linux, I discovered
that we're not actually checking the minimum bound at all.

The result of this is that when we verify the checksum, it's possible that
on a malformed header (with header_size of 0), we won't actually verify
any data.
