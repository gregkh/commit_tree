memory-failure: fix an error of mce_bad_pages statistics

When doing

    $ echo paddr > /sys/devices/system/memory/soft_offline_page

to offline a *free* page, the value of mce_bad_pages will be added, and
the page is set HWPoison flag, but it is still managed by page buddy
alocator.

   $ cat /proc/meminfo | grep HardwareCorrupted

shows the value.

If we offline the same page, the value of mce_bad_pages will be added
*again*, this means the value is incorrect now.  Assume the page is
still free during this short time.

  soft_offline_page()
    get_any_page()
      "else if (is_free_buddy_page(p))" branch return 0
        "goto done";
           "atomic_long_add(1, &mce_bad_pages);"

This patch:

Move poisoned page check at the beginning of the function in order to
fix the error.
