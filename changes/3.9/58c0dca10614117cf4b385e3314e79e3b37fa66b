drm: don't take modeset locks in getfb ioctl

We only need to push the fb unreference a bit down. While at it,
properly pass the return value from ->create_handle back to userspace.

Most drivers either return -ENODEV if they don't have a concept of
buffer objects (ast, cirrus, ...) or just install a handle for the
underlying gem object (which is ok since we hold a reference on that
through the framebuffer).

v2: Split out the ->create_handle rework in the individual drivers.
