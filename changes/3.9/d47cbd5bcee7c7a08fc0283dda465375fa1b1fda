crypto: ux500 - add missing comma

Commit 4f31f5b19eb0418a847b989abc9ac22af1991fe2
"PM / crypto / ux500: Use struct dev_pm_ops for power management"
add a new line to the driver struct but missed to add a
trailing comma, causing build errors when crypto is
selected. This adds the missing comma.

This was not noticed until now because the crypto block
is not in the ux500 defconfig. A separate patch will
be submitted to fix this.
