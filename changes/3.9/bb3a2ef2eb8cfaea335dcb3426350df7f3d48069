usb: musb: set TXMAXP and AUTOSET for full speed bulk in device mode

The TXMAXP register is not set correctly for full speed bulk case
when the can_bulk_split() is used. Without this PIO transfers will
not take place correctly

The "mult" factor needs to be updated correctly for the
can_bulk_split() case

The AUTOSET bit in the TXCSR is not being set if the "mult"
factor is greater than 0 for the High Bandwidth ISO case.
But the "mult" factor is also greater than 0 in case of Full speed
bulk transfers with the packet splitting in TXMAXP register

Without the AUTOSET the DMA transfers will not progress in mode1
