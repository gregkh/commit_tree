kdb: A fix for kdb command table expansion

When locally adding in some additional kdb commands, I stumbled
across an issue with the dynamic expansion of the kdb command table.
When the number of kdb commands exceeds the size of the statically
allocated kdb_base_commands[] array, additional space is allocated in
the kdb_register_repeat() routine.

The unused portion of the newly allocated array was not being initialized
to zero properly and this would result in segfaults when help '?' was
executed or when a search for a non-existing command would traverse the
command table beyond the end of valid command entries and then attempt
to use the non-zeroed area as actual command entries.
