Btrfs: fix warning when creating snapshots

Creating snapshot passes extent_root to commit its transaction,
but it can lead to the warning of checking root for quota in
the __btrfs_end_transaction() when someone else is committing
the current transaction.  Since we've recorded the needed root
in trans_handle, just use it to get rid of the warning.
