drm/i915: Don't wait for page flips if there was GPU reset

If a GPU reset occurs while a page flip has been submitted to the ring,
the flip will never complete once the ring has been reset.

The GPU reset can be detected by sampling the reset_counter before the
flip is submitted, and then while waiting for the flip, the sampled
counter is compared with the current reset_counter value.

common code as discussed on the mailing list.]
