[SCSI] fnic: Fnic Trace Utility

Fnic Trace utility is a tracing functionality built directly into fnic driver
to trace events. The benefit that trace buffer brings to fnic driver is the
ability to see what it happening inside the fnic driver. It also provides the
capability to trace every IO event inside fnic driver to debug panics, hangs
and potentially IO corruption issues. This feature makes it easy to find
problems in fnic driver and it also helps in tracking down strange bugs in a
more manageable way. Trace buffer is shared across all fnic instances for
this implementation.
