watchdog: sp5100_tco: Fix wrong indirect I/O access for getting value of reserved bits

In case of SB800 or later chipset and re-programming MMIO address(*),
sp5100_tco module may read incorrect value of reserved bit, because the module
reads a value from an incorrect I/O address. However, this bug doesn't cause
a problem, because when re-programming MMIO address, by chance the module
writes zero (this is BIOS's default value) to the low three bits of register.
* In most cases, PC with SB8x0 or later chipset doesn't need to re-programming
  MMIO address, because such PC can enable AcpiMmio and can use 0xfed80b00 for
  watchdog register base address.

This patch fixes this bug.
