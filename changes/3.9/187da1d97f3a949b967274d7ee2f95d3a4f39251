cpufreq: stats: do cpufreq_cpu_put() corresponding to cpufreq_cpu_get()

In cpufreq_stats_free_sysfs() we aren't balancing calls to
cpufreq_cpu_get() with cpufreq_cpu_put(). This will never let us have
ref count to policy->kobj as zero.

We will get a hang if somehow cpufreq_driver_unregister() is called.
And that can happen when we compile our driver as module and
insmod/rmmod it.
