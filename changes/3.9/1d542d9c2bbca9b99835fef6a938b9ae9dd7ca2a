KVM: PPC: booke: Allow multiple exception types

Current kvmppc_booke_handlers uses the same macro (KVM_HANDLER) and
all handlers are considered to be the same size. This will not be
the case if we want to use different macros for different handlers.

This patch improves the kvmppc_booke_handler so that it can
support different macros for different handlers.
