[SCSI] qla2xxx: Extra loopback error handling for ISP83xx.

Add the following error handling for loopback diagnostic mode with ISP83xx:

1. If we do not receive an MBA_DCBX_COMPLETE after our initial set port
configuration command, try to reset the port back into normal operation.
If that fails, take a FCoE dump and then reset the chip.
2. After completing the loopback diagnostic operation, if the reset of the port
back into normal operation fails then reset the port so we take a FCoE dump
and then reset the chip.
3. When we receive an IDC notification and the requested operation is loopback
extend the loop down timer so the link does not appear to down for an
extended period of time.
