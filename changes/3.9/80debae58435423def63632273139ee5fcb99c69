ARM: imx: fix imx31-dt.c time-related warning

Commit 6bb27d7 "ARM: delete struct sys_timer" caused the following:

arch/arm/mach-imx/imx31-dt.c:56:2: warning: initialization from incompatible pointer type [enabled by default]
arch/arm/mach-imx/imx31-dt.c:56:2: warning: (near initialization for ‘__mach_desc_IMX31_DT.init_time’) [enabled by default]

This is because mx31_clocks_init_dt() returns int, whereas the .init_time
field prototype expects a function returning void. Implement a wrapper so
that the prototypes match.
