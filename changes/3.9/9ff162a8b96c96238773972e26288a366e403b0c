net: introduce upper device lists

This lists are supposed to serve for storing pointers to all upper devices.
Eventually it will replace dev->master pointer which is used for
bonding, bridge, team but it cannot be used for vlan, macvlan where
there might be multiple upper present. In case the upper link is
replacement for dev->master, it is marked with "master" flag.

New upper device list resolves this limitation. Also, the information
stored in lists is used for preventing looping setups like
"bond->somethingelse->samebond"
