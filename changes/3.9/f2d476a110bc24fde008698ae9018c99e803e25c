drm/ttm: use ttm_bo_reserve_slowpath_nolru in ttm_eu_reserve_buffers, v2

This requires re-use of the seqno, which increases fairness slightly.
Instead of spinning with a new seqno every time we keep the current one,
but still drop all other reservations we hold. Only when we succeed,
we try to get back our other reservations again.

This should increase fairness slightly as well.

Changes since v1:
 - Increase val_seq before calling ttm_bo_reserve_slowpath_nolru and
   retrying to take all entries to prevent a race.
