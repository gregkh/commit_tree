ext4: simplify list handling in ext4_do_flush_completed_IO()

The function splices i_completed_io_list to its private list
first.  From that moment on we don't need any lock for working with
io_end structures because all io_end structure on the list are only
our own. So we can remove the other two lists in the function and free
io_end immediately after we are done with it.
