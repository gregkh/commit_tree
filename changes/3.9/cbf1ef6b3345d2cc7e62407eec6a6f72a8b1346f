sparc: use asm-generic version of types.h

In sparc headers we use the following pattern:

    #if defined(__sparc__) && defined(__arch64__)

    sparc64 specific stuff

    #else

    sparc32 specific stuff

    #endif

In types.h this pattern was not followed and here
we only checked for __sparc__ for no good reason.
It was a left-over from long time ago.

I checked other architectures - and most of them
do not have any such checks. And all the recently
merged versions uses the asm-generic version.
