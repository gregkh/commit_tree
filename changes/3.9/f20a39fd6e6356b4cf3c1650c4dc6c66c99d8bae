libceph: encapsulate connection backoff

Collect the code that tests for and implements a backoff delay for a
ceph connection into a new function, ceph_backoff().

Make the debug output messages in that part of the code report
things consistently by reporting a message in the socket closed
case, and by making the one for PREOPEN state report the connection
pointer like the rest.
