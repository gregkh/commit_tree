timekeeping: Add CONFIG_HAS_PERSISTENT_CLOCK option

Make the persistent clock check a kernel config option, so that some
platform can explicitely select it, also make CONFIG_RTC_HCTOSYS and
RTC_SYSTOHC depend on its non-existence, which could prevent the
persistent clock and RTC code from doing similar thing twice during
system's init/suspend/resume phases.

If the CONFIG_HAS_PERSISTENT_CLOCK=n, then no change happens for kernel
which still does the persistent clock check in timekeeping_init().
