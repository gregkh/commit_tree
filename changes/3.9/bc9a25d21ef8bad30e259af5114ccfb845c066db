bridge: Add vlan support for local fdb entries

When VLAN is added to the port, a local fdb entry for that port
(the entry with the mac address of the port) is added for that
VLAN.  This way we can correctly determine if the traffic
is for the bridge itself.  If the address of the port changes,
we try to change all the local fdb entries we have for that port.
