cpufreq_stats: do not remove sysfs files if frequency table is not present

The sysfs files for cpufreq_stats are created in cpufreq_stats_create_table()
called from cpufreq_stat_notifier_policy() when a policy is added to
the cpu. cpufreq_stats_create_table() will not be called if the
scaling driver does not export a frequency table to cpufreq.  Use the
same fence on tear down.
