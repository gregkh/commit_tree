fuse: implement NFS-like readdirplus support

This patch implements readdirplus support in FUSE, similar to NFS.
The payload returned in the readdirplus call contains
'fuse_entry_out' structure thereby providing all the necessary inputs
for 'faking' a lookup() operation on the spot.

If the dentry and inode already existed (for e.g. in a re-run of ls -l)
then just the inode attributes timeout and dentry timeout are refreshed.

With a simple client->network->server implementation of a FUSE based
filesystem, the following performance observations were made:

Test: Performing a filesystem crawl over 20,000 files with

sh# time ls -lR /mnt

Without readdirplus:
Run 1: 18.1s
Run 2: 16.0s
Run 3: 16.2s

With readdirplus:
Run 1: 4.1s
Run 2: 3.8s
Run 3: 3.8s

The performance improvement is significant as it avoided 20,000 upcalls
calls (lookup). Cache consistency is no worse than what already is.
