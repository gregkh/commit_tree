netfilter: ctnetlink: don't permit ct creation with random tuple

Userspace can cause kernel panic by not specifying orig/reply
tuple: kernel will create a tuple with random stack values.

Problem is that tuple.dst.dir will be random, too, which
causes nf_ct_tuplehash_to_ctrack() to return garbage.
