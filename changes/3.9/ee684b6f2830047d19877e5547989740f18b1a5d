tcp: send packets with a socket timestamp

A socket timestamp is a sum of the global tcp_time_stamp and
a per-socket offset.

A socket offset is added in places where externally visible
tcp timestamp option is parsed/initialized.

Connections in the SYN_RECV state are not supported, global
tcp_time_stamp is used for them, because repair mode doesn't support
this state. In a future it can be implemented by the similar way
as for TIME_WAIT sockets.
