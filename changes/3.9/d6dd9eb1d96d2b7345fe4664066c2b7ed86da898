drm/i915: dynamic Haswell display power well support

We can disable (almost) all the display hw if we only use pipe A, with
the integrated edp transcoder on port A. Because we don't set the cpu
transcoder that early (yet), we need to help us with a trick to simply
check for any edp encoders.

v2: Paulo Zanoni pointed out that we also need to configure the eDP
cpu transcoder correctly.

v3: Made by Paulo Zanoni
  - Rebase patch to be on top of "fix intel_init_power_wells" patch
  - Fix typos
  - Fix a small bug by adding a "connectors_active" check
  - Restore the initial code that unconditionally enables the power
    well when taking over from the BIOS

v4: Made by Paulo Zanoni
  - One more typo spotted by Jani Nikula

v5: Made by Paulo Zanoni
  - Rebase
