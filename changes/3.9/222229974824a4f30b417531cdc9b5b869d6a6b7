net: sctp: add build check for sctp_sf_eat_sack_6_2/jsctp_sf_eat_sack

In order to avoid any future surprises of kernel panics due to jprobes
function mismatches (as e.g. fixed in 4cb9d6eaf85ecd: sctp: jsctp_sf_eat_sack:
fix jprobes function signature mismatch), we should check both function
types during build and scream loudly if they do not match. __same_type
resolves to __builtin_types_compatible_p, which is 1 in case both types
are the same and 0 otherwise, qualifiers are ignored. Tested by myself.
