mtd: uclinux: support ROM and allow passing the base address

This allows to put the filesystem at a defined address in ROM allowing
to save more precious RAM.

I think it's safe to default to ROM because the intention of using the
uclinux map is to use a romfs and so mtd-ram doesn't give you anything
that mtd-rom doesn't.
