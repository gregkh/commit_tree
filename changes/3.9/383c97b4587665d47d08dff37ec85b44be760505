MIPS: Add dependencies for HAVE_ARCH_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE

The MIPS implementation of transparent huge-pages (THP) is 64-bit only,
and of course also requires that the CPU supports huge-pages.

Currently it's entirely possible to enable THP in other configurations,
which then fail to build due to pfn_pmd() not being defined.
