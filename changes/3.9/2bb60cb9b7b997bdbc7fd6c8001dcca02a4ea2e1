net: Fix locking bug in netif_set_xps_queue

Smatch found a locking bug in netif_set_xps_queue in which we were not
releasing the lock in the case of an allocation failure.

This change corrects that so that we release the xps_map_mutex before
returning -ENOMEM in the case of an allocation failure.
