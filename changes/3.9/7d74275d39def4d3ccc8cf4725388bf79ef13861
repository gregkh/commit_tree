x86: Make it so that __pa_symbol can only process kernel symbols on x86_64

I submitted an earlier patch that make __phys_addr an inline.  This obviously
results in an increase in the code size.  One step I can take to reduce that
is to make it so that the __pa_symbol call does a direct translation for
kernel addresses instead of covering all of virtual memory.

On my system this reduced the size for __pa_symbol from 5 instructions
totalling 30 bytes to 3 instructions totalling 16 bytes.
