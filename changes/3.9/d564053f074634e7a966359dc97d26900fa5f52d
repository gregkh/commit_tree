GFS2: Clean up freeze code

The freeze code has not been looked at a lot recently. Upstream has
moved on, and this is an attempt to catch us back up again. There
is a vfs level interface for the freeze code which can be called
from our (obsolete, but kept for backward compatibility purposes)
sysfs freeze interface. This means freezing this way vs. doing it
from the ioctl should now work in identical fashion.

As a result of this, the freeze function is only called once
and we can drop our own special purpose code for counting the
number of freezes.
