x86: Fix warning about cast from pointer to integer of different size

This patch fixes a warning reported by the kbuild test robot where we were
casting a pointer to a physical address which represents an integer of a
different size.  Per the suggestion of Peter Anvin I am replacing it and one
other spot where I made a similar cast with an unsigned long.
