i2c: Adding support for Intel iSMT SMBus 2.0 host controller

The iSMT (Intel SMBus Message Transport) supports multi-master I2C/SMBus,
as well as IPMI.  It's operation is DMA-based and utilizes descriptors to
initiate transactions on the bus.

The iSMT hardware can act as both a master and a target, although this
driver only supports being a master.
