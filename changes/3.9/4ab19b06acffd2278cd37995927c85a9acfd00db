edac: initialize the core earlier

In order for it to work with it builtin, the EDAC core should
be initialized earlier, otherwise the ghes_edac driver initializes
before edac_mc_sysfs_init() being called:

...
[    4.998373] EDAC MC0: Giving out device to 'ghes_edac.c' 'ghes_edac': DEV ghes
...
[    4.998373] EDAC MC1: Giving out device to 'ghes_edac.c' 'ghes_edac': DEV ghes
[    6.519495] EDAC MC: Ver: 3.0.0
[    6.523749] EDAC DEBUG: edac_mc_sysfs_init: device mc created

The net result is that no EDAC sysfs nodes will appear.
