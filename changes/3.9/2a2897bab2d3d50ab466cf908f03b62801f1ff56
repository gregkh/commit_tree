i2c: tegra: add support for Tegra114 SoC

NVIDIA's Tegra114 has following enhanced feature in i2c controller:
- Enable/disable control for per packet transfer complete interrupt.
  Earlier SoCs could not disable this.
- Single clock source for standard/fast and HS mode clock speed.
  The clock divisor for fast/standard mode is added into the i2c
  controller to meet the HS and standard/fast mode of clock speed
  from single source.

Add support for the above feature to make it functional on T114 SOCs.
