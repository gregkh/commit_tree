regmap: debugfs: Add a `max_reg' member in struct regmap_debugfs_off_cache

We are keeping track of the maximum register as well, this will make
things easier for us in sharing this code with the code implementing
the register ranges functionality.  It also simplifies a bit the
calculations when looking for the relevant block:offset from within
the cache.
