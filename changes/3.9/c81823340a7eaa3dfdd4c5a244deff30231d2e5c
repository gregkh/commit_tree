Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for _TARGET_PARAMS and call directly.

This patch removes typedef for _TARGET_PARAMS, and changes
the name of the struct to bcm_target_params. In addition,
any calls to struct "stTargetParams, TARGET_PARAMS,
*PTARGET_PARAMS, STARGETPARAMS,  or *PSTARGETPARAMS are
changed to call directly.
