ARC: [plat-arcfpga]: Enabling DeviceTree for Angel4 board

* arc-uart platform device now populated dynamically, using
  of_platform_populate() - applies to any other device whatsoever.

* uart in turn requires incore arc-intc to be also present in DT

* A irq-domain needs to be instantiated for IRQ requests by DT probed
  device (e.g. arc-uart)

TODO: switch over to linear irq domain once all devs have been
      transitioned to DT
