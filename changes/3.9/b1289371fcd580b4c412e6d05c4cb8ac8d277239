Revert "drm/i915: write backlight harder"

This reverts commit cf0a6584aa6d382f802f2c3cacac23ccbccde0cd.

Turns out that cargo-culting breaks systems. Note that we can't revert
further, since

    drm/i915: Fix blank panel at reopening lid

fixed a regression in 3.6-rc kernels for which we've never figured out
the exact root cause. But some further inspection of the backlight
code reveals that it's seriously lacking locking. And especially the
asle backlight update is know to get fired (through some smm magic)
when writing specific backlight control registers. So the possibility
of suffering from races is rather real.

Until those races are fixed I don't think it makes sense to try
further hacks. Which sucks a bit, but sometimes that's how it is :(
