staging: comedi: quatech_daqp_cs: store private data in the comedi_device

All the comedi_subdevices in this driver use the same 'local' private data.
Instead of storing the pointer to the private data in each subdevice, just
store it in the comedi_device.

Also, instead of passing the private data pointer to pcmcia_request_irq()
in link->priv, pass the comedi_device pointer. This allows removing the
comedi_device and comedi_subdevice pointers from the private data. We can
get them as needed from the void * in the interrupt function.

Fix the pcmcia suspend/resume functions so they use the comedi_device
pointer stored in link->priv to then get the private data pointer.
