ARM: tegra30: fix power up sequence for boot_secondary

The power up sequence is different on the cold boot CPU and the CPU
that resumed from the hotplug. For the cold boot CPU, it was been power
gated as default. To power up the cold boot CPU, the power should be
un-gated by un toggling the power gate register manually.

For the CPU that resumed from the hotplug, after un-halted the CPU. The
flow controller will un-gate the power of the CPU. No need to manually
control, just wait the power be resumed and continue the power up
sequence after the CPU power is ready.
