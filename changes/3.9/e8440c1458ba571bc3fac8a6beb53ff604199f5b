uprobes: Add exports for module use

The original pull message for uprobes (commit 654443e2) noted:

  This tree includes uprobes support in 'perf probe' - but SystemTap
  (and other tools) can take advantage of user probe points as well.

In order to actually be usable in module-based tools like SystemTap, the
interface needs to be exported.  This patch first adds the obvious
exports for uprobe_register and uprobe_unregister.  Then it also adds
one for task_user_regset_view, which is necessary to get the correct
state of userspace registers.
