drm/fb-helper: don't disable everything in initial_config

This should be done in the drivers for two reasons:
- it gets in the way of fastboot efforts
- it links the fb helpers with the crtc helpers instead of going
  through the real interface vfuncs, forcing i915 to fake all the
  ->disable callbacks used by the crtc helper to avoid ugly Oopsen

v2: Resolve conflicts since drivers still call
drm_fb_helper_single_add_all_connectors.
