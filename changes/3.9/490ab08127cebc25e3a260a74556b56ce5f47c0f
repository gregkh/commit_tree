IP_GRE: Fix IP-Identification.

GRE-GSO generates ip fragments with id 0,2,3,4... for every
GSO packet, which is not correct. Following patch fixes it
by setting ip-header id unique id of fragments are allowed.
As Eric Dumazet suggested it is optimized by using inner ip-header
whenever inner packet is ipv4.
