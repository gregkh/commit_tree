mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: fix host version read

When commit 95a2482 (mmc: sdhci-esdhc-imx: add basic imx6q usdhc
support) works around host version issue on imx6q, it gets the
register address fixup "reg ^= 2" lost for imx25/35/51/53 esdhc.
Thus, the controller version on these SoCs is wrongly identified
as v1 while it's actually v2.

Add the address fixup back and take a different approach to correct
imx6q host version, so that the host version read gets back to work
for all SoCs.
