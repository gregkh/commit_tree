ACPI: Rework acpi_get_child() to be more efficient

Observe that acpi_get_child() doesn't need to use the helper
struct acpi_find_child structure and change it to work without it.
Also, using acpi_get_object_info() to get the output of _ADR for the
given device is overkill, because that function does much more than
just evaluating _ADR (let alone the additional memory allocation
done by it).

Moreover, acpi_get_child() doesn't need to loop any more once it has
found a matching handle, so make it stop in that case.  To prevent
the results from changing, make it use do_acpi_find_child() as
a post-order callback.
