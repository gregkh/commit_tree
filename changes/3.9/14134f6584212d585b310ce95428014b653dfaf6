af_unix: dont send SCM_CREDENTIAL when dest socket is NULL

SCM_SCREDENTIALS should apply to write() syscalls only either source or destination
socket asserted SOCK_PASSCRED. The original implememtation in maybe_add_creds is wrong,
and breaks several LSB testcases ( i.e. /tset/LSB.os/netowkr/recvfrom/T.recvfrom).
