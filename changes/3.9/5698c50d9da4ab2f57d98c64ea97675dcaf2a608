metag: Internal and external irqchips

Meta core internal interrupts (from HWSTATMETA and friends) are vectored
onto the TR1 core trigger for the current thread. This is demultiplexed
in irq-metag.c to individual Linux IRQs for each internal interrupt.

External SoC interrupts (from HWSTATEXT and friends) are vectored onto
the TR2 core trigger for the current thread. This is demultiplexed in
irq-metag-ext.c to individual Linux IRQs for each external SoC interrupt.
The external irqchip has devicetree bindings for configuring the number
of irq banks and the type of masking available.
