x86, boot: Move verify_cpu.S and no_longmode down

We need to move some code to 32bit section in following patch:

   x86, boot: Move lldt/ltr out of 64bit code section

but that will push startup_64 down from 0x200.

According to hpa, we can not change startup_64 position and that
is an ABI.

We could move function verify_cpu and no_longmode down, because
verify_cpu is used via function call and no_longmode will not
return, then we don't need to add extra code for jumping back.
