ext4: remove __ext4_journalled_writepage() from mpage_da_submit_io()

We don't support delayed allocation in data=journal mode. So checking for it in
mpage_da_submit_io() doesn't make really sence. If we ever decide to extend
delayed allocation support to data=journal mode, adding
__ext4_journalled_writepage() call will be the least of problems we have to
solve. Most likely we'd have to implement separate writepages call anyways
because we don't have transaction credits for writing more than a single page
so mapping of page buffers would have to be done differently.
