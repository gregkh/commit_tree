m68k: drop "select EMAC_INC"

Somehow this select statement managed to squeeze itself between commit
0e152d80507b75c00aac60f2ffc586360687cd52 ("m68k: reorganize Kconfig
options to improve mmu/non-mmu selections") and commit
95e82747d6e2abc513bfae416e6009968985d05b ("m68k: drop unused Kconfig
symbols"). Whatever happened, there is no Kconfig symbol named EMAC_INC.
The select statement for that symbol is a nop. Drop it.
