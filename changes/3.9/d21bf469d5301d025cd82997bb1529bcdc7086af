drm/fb-helper: kill drm_fb_helper_restore

It's only used internally for the sysrq and panic handlers provided by
the drm fb helper implementation. Hence just inline it, kill the
export and remove the confusing kerneldoc. Driver's are supposed to
call drm_fb_helper_restore_fbdev_mode on lastclose.

Note that locking is totally fubar - the sysrq case doesn't take any
locks at all. The panic handler probably shouldn't take any locks
since it'll only make things worse. Otoh it's probably better to
switch things over to the atomic modeset callbacks (and disable the
panic handler for those drivers which don't implement it).

But that's both better done in separate patches.
