ARM: ux500: Apply the TCPM and TCDM locations and sizes to dbx5x0 DT

This fixes a regression introduced by commit:
  05ec260 mfd:db8500-prcmu: update resource passing

All DBx5x0 based SoCs have access to two Tightly Coupled Memory
(TCM) locations based on the PRCMU itself. One area from program
memory (TCPM) and one for data memory (TCDM). The PRCMU needs to
know where these are in order to function correctly. However,
these are currently passed though platform device resources, which
can only be obtained if Device Tree booting isn't in use. Thus we
must also support them in DT by supplying them through the PRCMU
node.
