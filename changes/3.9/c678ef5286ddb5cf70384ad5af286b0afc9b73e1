block: avoid using uninitialized value in from queue_var_store

As found by gcc-4.8, the QUEUE_SYSFS_BIT_FNS macro creates functions
that use a value generated by queue_var_store independent of whether
that value was set or not.

block/blk-sysfs.c: In function 'queue_store_nonrot':
block/blk-sysfs.c:244:385: warning: 'val' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

Unlike most other such warnings, this one is not a false positive,
writing any non-number string into the sysfs files indeed has
an undefined result, rather than returning an error.
