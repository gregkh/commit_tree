9p: Modify the stat structures to use kuid_t and kgid_t

9p has thre strucrtures that can encode inode stat information.  Modify
all of those structures to contain kuid_t and kgid_t values.  Modify
he wire encoders and decoders of those structures to use 'u' and 'g' instead of
'd' in the format string where uids and gids are present.

This results in all kuid and kgid conversion to and from on the wire values
being performed by the same code in protocol.c where the client is known
at the time of the conversion.
