mfd: omap-usb-tll: Clean up clock handling

Every channel has a functional clock that is similarly named.
It makes sense to use a for loop to manage these clocks as OMAPs
can come with up to 3 channels.

Dynamically allocate and get channel clocks depending on the
number of clocks avaiable on the platform.
