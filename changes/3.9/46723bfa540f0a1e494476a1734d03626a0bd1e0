memory-hotplug: implement register_page_bootmem_info_section of sparse-vmemmap

For removing memmap region of sparse-vmemmap which is allocated bootmem,
memmap region of sparse-vmemmap needs to be registered by
get_page_bootmem().  So the patch searches pages of virtual mapping and
registers the pages by get_page_bootmem().

NOTE: register_page_bootmem_memmap() is not implemented for ia64,
      ppc, s390, and sparc.  So introduce CONFIG_HAVE_BOOTMEM_INFO_NODE
      and revert register_page_bootmem_info_node() when platform doesn't
      support it.

      It's implemented by adding a new Kconfig option named
      CONFIG_HAVE_BOOTMEM_INFO_NODE, which will be automatically selected
      by memory-hotplug feature fully supported archs(currently only on
      x86_64).

      Since we have 2 config options called MEMORY_HOTPLUG and
      MEMORY_HOTREMOVE used for memory hot-add and hot-remove separately,
      and codes in function register_page_bootmem_info_node() are only
      used for collecting infomation for hot-remove, so reside it under
      MEMORY_HOTREMOVE.

      Besides page_isolation.c selected by MEMORY_ISOLATION under
      MEMORY_HOTPLUG is also such case, move it too.
