brcmfmac: use brcmf_if::bssidx as index in interface list

Upon receiving an IF event from the firmware the interface
was created and stored on a list using the interface index.
With upcoming P2P feature the firmware will send a IF event
in which two interfaces have the same interface index. To
uniquely locate them on the list the bss index is now used.
