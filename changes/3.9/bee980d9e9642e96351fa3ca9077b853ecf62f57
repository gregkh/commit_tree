xen/events: Handle VIRQ_TIMER before any other hardirq in event loop.

This avoids any other hardirq handler seeing a very stale jiffies
value immediately after wakeup from a long idle period. The one
observable symptom of this was a USB keyboard, with software keyboard
repeat, which would always repeat a key immediately that it was
pressed. This is due to the key press waking the guest, the key
handler immediately runs, sees an old jiffies value, and then that
jiffies value significantly updated, before the key is unpressed.
