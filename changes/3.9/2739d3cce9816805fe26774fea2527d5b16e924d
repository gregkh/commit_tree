cgroup: fix bogus kernel warnings when cgroup_create() failed

If cgroup_create() failed and cgroup_destroy_locked() is called to
do cleanup, we'll see a bunch of warnings:

cgroup_addrm_files: failed to remove 2MB.limit_in_bytes, err=-2
cgroup_addrm_files: failed to remove 2MB.usage_in_bytes, err=-2
cgroup_addrm_files: failed to remove 2MB.max_usage_in_bytes, err=-2
cgroup_addrm_files: failed to remove 2MB.failcnt, err=-2
cgroup_addrm_files: failed to remove prioidx, err=-2
cgroup_addrm_files: failed to remove ifpriomap, err=-2
...

We failed to remove those files, because cgroup_create() has failed
before creating those cgroup files.

To fix this, we simply don't warn if cgroup_rm_file() can't find the
cft entry.
