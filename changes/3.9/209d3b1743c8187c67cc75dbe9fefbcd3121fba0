ACPI: Replace ACPI device add_type field with a match_driver flag

After the removal of the second argument of acpi_bus_scan() there is
no difference between the ACPI_BUS_ADD_MATCH and ACPI_BUS_ADD_START
add types, so the add_type field in struct acpi_device may be
replaced with a single flag.  Do that calling the flag match_driver.
