ALSA: hda - Workaround for silent output on Sony Vaio VGC-LN51JGB with ALC889

Some Vaio all-in-one desktop PCs (for example VGC-LN51JGB) are affected by
the same issue that caused Vaio Z laptops to become silent: the speaker pin
must be connected to the first DAC even though the codec itself advertises
flexible routing through any of the DACs.

Use the no-primary-hp fixup for choosing the speaker pin as the primary so
that the right DAC is assigned on this device.
