net: splice: fix __splice_segment()

commit 9ca1b22d6d2 (net: splice: avoid high order page splitting)
forgot that skb->head could need a copy into several page frags.

This could be the case for loopback traffic mostly.

Also remove now useless skb argument from linear_to_page()
and __splice_segment() prototypes.
