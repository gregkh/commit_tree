Btrfs: remove extent mapping if we fail to add chunk

I got a double free error when unmounting a file system that failed to add a
chunk during its operation.  This is because we will kfree the mapping that
we created but leave the extent_map in the em_tree for chunks.  So to fix
this just remove the extent_map when we error out so we don't run into this
problem.  Thanks,
