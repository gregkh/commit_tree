xen/smp: Move the common CPU init code a bit to prep for PVH patch.

The PV and PVH code CPU init code share some functionality. The
PVH code ("xen/pvh: Extend vcpu_guest_context, p2m, event, and XenBus")
sets some of these up, but not all. To make it easier to read, this
patch removes the PV specific out of the generic way.

No functional change - just code movement.
