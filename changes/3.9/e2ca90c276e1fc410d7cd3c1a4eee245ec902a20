ax88179_178a: ASIX AX88179_178A USB 3.0/2.0 to gigabit ethernet adapter driver

This is a resubmission.
Added kfree() in ax88179_get_eeprom to prevent memory leakage.
Modified "__le16 rxctl" to "u16 rxctl" in "struct ax88179_data" and removed pointless casts.
Removed asix_init and asix_exit functions and added "module_usb_driver(ax88179_178a_driver)".
Fixed endianness issue on big endian systems and verified this driver on iBook G4.
Removed steps that change net->features in ax88179_set_features function.
Added "const" to ethtool_ops structure and fixed the coding style of AX88179_BULKIN_SIZE array.
Fixed the issue that the default MTU is not 1500.
Added ax88179_change_mtu function and enabled the hardware jumbo frame function to support an
MTU higher than 1500.
Fixed indentation and empty line coding style errors.
The _nopm version usb functions were added to access register in suspend and resume functions.
Serveral variables allocted dynamically were removed and replaced by stack variables.
ax88179_get_eeprom were modified from asix_get_eeprom in asix_common.

This patch adds a driver for ASIX's AX88179 family of USB 3.0/2.0
to gigabit ethernet adapters. It's based on the AX88xxx driver but
the usb commands used to access registers for AX88179 are completely different.
This driver had been verified on x86 system with AX88179/AX88178A and
Sitcomm LN-032 USB dongles.
