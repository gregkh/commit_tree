ACPI: add support for CSRT table

Core System Resources Table (CSRT) is a proprietary ACPI table that
contains resources for certain devices that are not found in the DSDT
table. Typically a shared DMA controller might be found here.

This patch adds support for this table. We go through all entries in the
table and make platform devices of them. The resources from the table are
passed with the platform device.

There is one special resource in the table and it is the DMA request line
base and number of request lines. This information might be needed by the
DMA controller driver as it needs to map the ACPI DMA request line number
to the actual request line understood by the hardware. This range is passed
as IORESOURCE_DMA resource.
