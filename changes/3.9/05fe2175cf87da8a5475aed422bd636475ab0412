[media] em28xx: refactor the code in em28xx_usb_disconnect()

The main purpose of this patch is to move the call of em28xx_release_resources()
after the call of em28xx_close_extension().
This is necessary, because some resources might be needed/used by the extensions
fini() functions when they get closed.
Also mark the device as disconnected earlier in this function and unify the
em28xx_uninit_usb_xfer() calls for analog and digital mode.
