tipc: fix missing spinlock init in broadcast code

After commit 3c294cb3 "tipc: remove the bearer congestion mechanism",
we try to grab the broadcast bearer lock when sending multicast
messages over the broadcast link. This will cause an oops because
the lock is never initialized. This is an old bug, but the lock
was never actually used before commit 3c294cb3, so that why it was
not visible until now.  The oops will look something like:

	BUG: spinlock bad magic on CPU#2, daemon/147
	lock: bcast_bearer+0x48/0xffffffffffffd19a [tipc],
	.magic: 00000000, .owner: <none>/-1, .owner_cpu: 0
	Pid: 147, comm: daemon Not tainted 3.8.0-rc3+ #206
	Call Trace:

The above can be triggered by running the multicast demo program.
