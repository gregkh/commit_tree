memcg: stop warning on memcg_propagate_kmem

Whilst I run the risk of a flogging for disloyalty to the Lord of Sealand,
I do have CONFIG_MEMCG=y CONFIG_MEMCG_KMEM not set, and grow tired of the
"mm/memcontrol.c:4972:12: warning: `memcg_propagate_kmem' defined but not
used [-Wunused-function]" seen in 3.8-rc: move the #ifdef outwards.
