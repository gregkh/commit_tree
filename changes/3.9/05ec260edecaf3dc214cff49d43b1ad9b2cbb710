mfd: db8500-prcmu: update resource passing

When trying to get rid of the cross-includes of <mach/id.h>
from different drivers, so we can localize ASIC/CPU detection
to the mach-ux500 folder, we run into the way the PRCMU
handles base addresses and firmware detection.

This patch updates the firmware version detection to pass
the required information as platform data instead of
relying on cpu_is_* macros.

Now the PRCMU base address, the secondary TCDM area, the
TCPM area and the IRQ are passed as resources instead of
being grabbed from <mach/*> files. Incidentally this also
removes part of the reliance on <mach/irqs.h>.

Further it updates the firmware version detection, since the
location of the firmware ID bytes in the designated memory
are is now passed from the platform data instead. There is
no reason not to include the nice split-off of a struct to
hold the firmware information and a separate function to
populate it.

The patch actually rids the need to use the external
db8500_prcmu_early_init call at all, but I'm keepin back
that removal as I don't want the patch to be too big.
