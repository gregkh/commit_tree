ASoC: spear_pcm: Update to new pcm_new() API

Commit 552d1ef6 ("ASoC: core - Optimise and refactor pcm_new() to pass only
rtd") updated the pcm_new() callback to take the rtd as the only parameter. The
spear PCM driver (which was merged much later) still uses the old API. This
patch updates the driver to the new API.
