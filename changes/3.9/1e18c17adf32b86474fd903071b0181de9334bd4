powerpc: Enable the Watchdog vector for 405

The watchdog and FIT code has been #if 0'd for ever, if the CPU takes
an exception to either of those vectors it will jump into the middle
of the PIT or Data TLB code and surely crash.

At least some (all?) 405 cores have both the WDT and FIT
vectors defined, so lets have proper entry points for them.

Tested that the WDT vector works on a 405F6 core.
