USB / PM: Don't try to hide PM QoS flags from usb_port_device_release()

Remove the call to dev_pm_qos_hide_flags(), added by commit 6e30d7cb
"usb: Add driver/usb/core/(port.c,hub.h) files", from
usb_port_device_release(), because (1) it is completely unnecessary
(the flags have been removed already by the PM core during the
unregistration of the device object) and (2) it triggers a NULL
pointer dereference in sysfs_find_dirent() (dev->kobj.sd is NULL at
this point).
