net: fec: fix missing napi_disable call

Commit dc975382d2ef36be7e78fac3717927de1a5abcd8 introduces napi support
but never calls napi_disable. This will generate a kernel oops
(kernel BUG at include/linux/netdevice.h:473!) every time, when
ndo_stop is called followed by ndo_start.
Add the missing napi_diable call.
