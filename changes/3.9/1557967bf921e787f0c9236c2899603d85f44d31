RDMA/cxgb4: Display streaming mode error only if detected in RTS

With later firmware, the chances of getting streaming mode data after
we exit RTS is likely, so we don't need to warn for it.  The only real
case where we don't expect it is when the QP is in RTS.

Move QP to ERROR when streaming mode data received.
