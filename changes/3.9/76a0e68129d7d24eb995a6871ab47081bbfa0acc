pch_gbe: fix ip_summed checksum reporting on rx

skb->ip_summed should be CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY when the driver reports that
checksums were correct and CHECKSUM_NONE in any other case. They're
currently placed vice versa, which breaks the forwarding scenario. Fix it
by placing them as described above.
