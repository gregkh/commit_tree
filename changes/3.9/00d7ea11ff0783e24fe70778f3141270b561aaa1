mwifiex: fix race when queuing commands

Running the following script repeatedly on XO-4 with SD8787
produces command timeout and system lockup.

insmod mwifiex_sdio.ko
sleep 1
ifconfig eth0 up
iwlist eth0 scan &
sleep 0.5
rmmod mwifiex_sdio

mwifiex_send_cmd_async() is called for sync as well as async
commands. (mwifiex_send_cmd_sync() internally calls it for
sync command.)

"adapter->cmd_queued" gets filled inside mwifiex_send_cmd_async()
routine for both types of commands. But it is used only for sync
commands in mwifiex_wait_queue_complete(). This could lead to a
race when two threads try to queue a sync command with another
sync/async command simultaneously.

Get rid of global variable and pass command node as a parameter
to mwifiex_wait_queue_complete() to fix the problem.
