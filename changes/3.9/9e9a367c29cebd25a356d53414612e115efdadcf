ARM: Section based HYP idmap

Add a method (hyp_idmap_setup) to populate a hyp pgd with an
identity mapping of the code contained in the .hyp.idmap.text
section.

Offer a method to drop this identity mapping through
hyp_idmap_teardown.

Make all the above depend on CONFIG_ARM_VIRT_EXT and CONFIG_ARM_LPAE.
