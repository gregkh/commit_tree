[SCSI] sr: support runtime pm

This patch adds runtime pm support for sr.

It did this by increasing the runtime usage_count of the device when
its block device is accessed. And decreasing the runtime usage_count
of the device when the access is done.

If there is media inside, runtime suspend is not allowed as we don't
always know if the ODD is being used or not.

The idea is discussed here:
http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.acpi.devel/55243/focus=52703
and the restriction to check media inside is discussed here:
