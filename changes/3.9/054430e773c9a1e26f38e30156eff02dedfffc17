fbcon: fix locking harder

Okay so Alan's patch handled the case where there was no registered fbcon,
however the other path entered in set_con2fb_map pit.

In there we called fbcon_takeover, but we also took the console lock in a couple
of places. So push the console lock out to the callers of set_con2fb_map,

this means fbmem and switcheroo needed to take the lock around the fb notifier
entry points that lead to this.

This should fix the efifb regression seen by Maarten.
