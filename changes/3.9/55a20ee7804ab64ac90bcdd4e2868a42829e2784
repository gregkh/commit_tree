x86, kdump: Retore crashkernel= to allocate under 896M

Vivek found old kexec-tools does not work new kernel anymore.

So change back crashkernel= back to old behavoir, and add crashkernel_high=
to let user decide if buffer could be above 4G, and also new kexec-tools will
be needed.

-v2: let crashkernel=X override crashkernel_high=
    update description about _high will be ignored by crashkernel=X
-v3: update description about kernel-parameters.txt according to Vivek.
