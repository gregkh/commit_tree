NFSv4.1: Fix a race in pNFS layoutcommit

We need to clear the NFS_LSEG_LAYOUTCOMMIT bits atomically with the
NFS_INO_LAYOUTCOMMIT bit, otherwise we may end up with situations
where the two are out of sync.
The first half of the problem is to ensure that pnfs_layoutcommit_inode
clears the NFS_LSEG_LAYOUTCOMMIT bit through pnfs_list_write_lseg.
We still need to keep the reference to those segments until the RPC call
is finished, so in order to make it clear _where_ those references come
from, we add a helper pnfs_list_write_lseg_done() that cleans up after
pnfs_list_write_lseg.
