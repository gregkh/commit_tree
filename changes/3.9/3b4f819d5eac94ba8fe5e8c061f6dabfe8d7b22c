Revert "drm/i915: try to train DP even harder"

This reverts commit 0d71068835e2610576d369d6d4cbf90e0f802a71.

Not only that the commit introduces a bogus check (voltage_tries == 5
will never meet at the inserted code path), it brings the i915 driver
into an endless dp-train loop on HP Z1 desktop machine with IVY+eDP.

At least reverting this commit recovers the framebuffer (but X is
still broken by other reasons...)
