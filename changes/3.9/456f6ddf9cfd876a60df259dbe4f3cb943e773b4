iwlwifi: mvm: Change the Time Event type used for ROC

The TE_P2P_DEVICE_DISCOVERABLE time event type used for ROC is
assigned low priority in the FW, and thus has low chance of
being scheduled when there are active BSS or GO VMACs (even if
fragmentation is allowed). This is mainly problematic in for
cases where ROC is requested for sending action frames.

To overcome this, use a time event type that has priority equal
to that ot the time event type used by the FW to action scan.
