Revert "crypto: talitos - add IPsec ESN support"

This reverts commit e763eb699be723fb41af818118068c6b3afdaf8d.

Current IPsec ESN implementation for authencesn(cbc(aes), hmac(sha))
(separate encryption and integrity algorithms) does not conform
to RFC4303.

ICV is generated by hashing the sequence
SPI, SeqNum-High, SeqNum-Low, IV, Payload
instead of
SPI, SeqNum-Low, IV, Payload, SeqNum-High.
