lmo commit c17a6554 (MIPS: page.h: Provide more readable definition for
PAGE_MASK) apparently breaks ioremap of 36-bit addresses on my Alchemy
systems (PCI and PCMCIA) The reason is that in arch/mips/mm/ioremap.c
line 157  (phys_addr &= PAGE_MASK) bits 32-35 are cut off.  Seems the
new PAGE_MASK is explicitly 32bit, or one could make it signed instead
of unsigned long.
