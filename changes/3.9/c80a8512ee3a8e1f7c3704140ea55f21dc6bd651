net/core: move vlan_depth out of while loop in skb_network_protocol()

[ Bug added added in commit 05e8ef4ab2d8087d (net: factor out
  skb_mac_gso_segment() from skb_gso_segment() ) ]

move vlan_depth out of while loop, or else vlan_depth always is ETH_HLEN,
can not be increased, and lead to infinite loop when frame has two vlan headers.
