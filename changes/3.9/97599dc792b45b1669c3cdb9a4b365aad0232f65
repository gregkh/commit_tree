net: drop dst before queueing fragments

Commit 4a94445c9a5c (net: Use ip_route_input_noref() in input path)
added a bug in IP defragmentation handling, as non refcounted
dst could escape an RCU protected section.

Commit 64f3b9e203bd068 (net: ip_expire() must revalidate route) fixed
the case of timeouts, but not the general problem.

Tom Parkin noticed crashes in UDP stack and provided a patch,
but further analysis permitted us to pinpoint the root cause.

Before queueing a packet into a frag list, we must drop its dst,
as this dst has limited lifetime (RCU protected)

When/if a packet is finally reassembled, we use the dst of the very
last skb, still protected by RCU and valid, as the dst of the
reassembled packet.

Use same logic in IPv6, as there is no need to hold dst references.
