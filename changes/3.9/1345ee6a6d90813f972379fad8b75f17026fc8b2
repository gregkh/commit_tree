cfg80211: fix potential BSS memory leak and update

In the odd case that while updating information from a beacon,
a BSS was found that is part of a hidden group, we drop the
new information. In this case, however, we leak the IE buffer
from the update, and erroneously update the entry's timestamp
so it will never time out. Fix both these issues.
