mac80211: split TX aggregation stop action

When TX aggregation is stopped, there are a few
different cases:
 - connection with the peer was dropped
 - session stop was requested locally
 - session stop was requested by the peer
 - connection was dropped while a session is stopping

The behaviour in these cases should be different, if
the connection is dropped then the driver should drop
all frames, otherwise the frames may continue to be
transmitted, aggregated in the case of a locally
requested session stop or unaggregated in the case of
the peer requesting session stop.

Split these different cases so that the driver can
act accordingly; however, treat local and remote stop
the same way and ask the driver to not send frames as
aggregated packets any more.

In the case of connection drop, the stop callback the
driver is otherwise supposed to call is no longer
required.
