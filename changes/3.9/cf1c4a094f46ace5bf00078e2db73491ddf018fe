netfilter: ipset: timeout values corrupted on set resize

If a resize is triggered on a set with timeouts enabled, the timeout
values will get corrupted when copying them to the new set. This occured
b/c the wrong timeout value is supplied to type_pf_elem_tadd().

This also adds simple debug statement similar to the one in type_pf_resize().
