powerpc: pSeries_lpar_hpte_remove fails from Adjunct partition being performed before the ANDCOND test

Some versions of pHyp will perform the adjunct partition test before the
ANDCOND test.  The result of this is that H_RESOURCE can be returned and
cause the BUG_ON condition to occur. The HPTE is not removed.  So add a
check for H_RESOURCE, it is ok if this HPTE is not removed as
pSeries_lpar_hpte_remove is looking for an HPTE to remove and not a
specific HPTE to remove.  So it is ok to just move on to the next slot
and try again.
