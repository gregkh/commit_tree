Btrfs: don't drop path when printing out tree errors in scrub

A user reported a panic where we were panicing somewhere in
tree_backref_for_extent from scrub_print_warning.  He only captured the trace
but looking at scrub_print_warning we drop the path right before we mess with
the extent buffer to print out a bunch of stuff, which isn't right.  So fix this
by dropping the path after we use the eb if we need to.  Thanks,
