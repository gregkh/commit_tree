ARM: 7630/1: mmc: mmci: Fixup and cleanup code for DMA handling

The cookie is now used to indicate if dma_unmap_sg shall be
done in post_request. At DMA errors, the DMA job is immediately
not only terminated but also unmapped. To indicate that this
has been done the cookie is reset to zero. post_request will
thus only do dma_umap_sg for requests which has a cookie not set
to zero.

Some corresponding duplicated code could then be removed and
moreover some corrections at DMA errors for terminating the same
DMA job twice has also been fixed.
