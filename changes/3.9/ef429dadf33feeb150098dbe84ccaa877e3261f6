mac80211: introduce beacon-only timing data

In order to be able to predict the next DTIM TBTT
in the driver, add the ability to use timing data
from beacons only with the new hardware flag
IEEE80211_HW_TIMING_BEACON_ONLY and the BSS info
value sync_dtim_count which is only valid if the
timing data came from a beacon. The data can only
come from a beacon, and if no beacon was received
before association it is updated later together
with the DTIM count notification.
