mac80211: properly track HT/VHT operation changes

A while ago, I made the mac80211 station code never change
the channel type after association. This solved a number of
issues but is ultimately wrong, we should react if the AP
changes the HT operation IE and switches bandwidth. One of
the issues is that we associate as HT40 capable, but if the
AP ever switches to 40 MHz we won't be able to receive such
frames because we never set our channel to 40 MHz.

This addresses this and VHT operation changes. If there's a
change that is incompatible with our setup, e.g. if the AP
decides to change the channel entirely (and for some reason
we still hear the beacon) we'll just disconnect.
