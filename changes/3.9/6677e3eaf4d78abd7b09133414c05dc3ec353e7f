memory-hotplug: check whether all memory blocks are offlined or not when removing memory

We remove the memory like this:

 1. lock memory hotplug
 2. offline a memory block
 3. unlock memory hotplug
 4. repeat 1-3 to offline all memory blocks
 5. lock memory hotplug
 6. remove memory(TODO)
 7. unlock memory hotplug

All memory blocks must be offlined before removing memory.  But we don't
hold the lock in the whole operation.  So we should check whether all
memory blocks are offlined before step6.  Otherwise, kernel maybe
panicked.

Offlining a memory block and removing a memory device can be two
different operations.  Users can just offline some memory blocks without
removing the memory device.  For this purpose, the kernel has held
lock_memory_hotplug() in __offline_pages().  To reuse the code for
memory hot-remove, we repeat step 1-3 to offline all the memory blocks,
repeatedly lock and unlock memory hotplug, but not hold the memory
hotplug lock in the whole operation.
