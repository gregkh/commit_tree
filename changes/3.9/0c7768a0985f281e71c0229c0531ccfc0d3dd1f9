net: fec: Remove 'inline' declarations

Fix the following warning when building with W=1 option:

drivers/net/ethernet/freescale/fec.c:810:1: warning: '__inline__' is not at beginning of declaration [-Wold-style-declaration]

The inline declaration is pointless in this function, so just remove it.

While at it, also remove the other 'inline' declarations.
