eCryptfs: initialize payload_len in keystore.c

This is meant to remove a compiler warning.  It should not make any
functional change.

payload_len should be initialized when it is passed to
write_tag_64_packet() as a pointer.  If that call fails, this function
should return early, and payload_len won't be used.
