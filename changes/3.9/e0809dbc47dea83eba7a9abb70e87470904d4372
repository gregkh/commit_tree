bonding: Fix initialize after use for 3ad machine state spinlock

The 3ad machine state spinlock can be used before it is inititialized
while doing bond_enslave() (and the port is being initialized) since
port->slave is set before the lock is prepared, thus causing soft
lock-ups and a multitude of other nasty bugs.

[ Rename __initialize_port_locks() variable name to 'slave' -DaveM ]
