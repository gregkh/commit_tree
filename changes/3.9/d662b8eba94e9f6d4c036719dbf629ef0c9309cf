staging: zsmalloc: make CLASS_DELTA relative to PAGE_SIZE

Right now ZS_SIZE_CLASS_DELTA is hardcoded to be 16.  This
creates 254 classes for systems with 4k pages. However, on
PPC64 with 64k pages, it creates 4095 classes which is far
too many.

This patch makes ZS_SIZE_CLASS_DELTA relative to PAGE_SIZE
so that regardless of the page size, there will be the same
number of classes.
