staging: android: Add some Kconfig help entries

This commit adds Kconfig entries for the following:

	1: ANDROID_BINDER_IPC
	2: ASHMEM (additional text)
	3: ANDROID_LOGGER

It also changes "Register" to "Registers" in
ANDROID_LOW_MEMORY_KILLER

Finally, all "help" instances are changed to "---help---",
as recommended by kconfig-language.txt in order to visually
aid developers.
