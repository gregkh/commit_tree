bnx2fc: Make the fcoe_cltr the SCSI host parent

The fcoemon userspace daemon is searching for the a hostX
under the the /sys/bus/fcoe/devices/ctlrX/ entries. When
interfaces created using fcoe_sysfs and fcoe.ko this linkage
is setup correctly, but bnx2fc is not doing the same thing
and therefore fcoemon does not create the fcoe interface
for bnx2fc.

This patch sets up the correct linkage for bnx2fc such that
fcoemon will work correctly with fcoe_sysfs and bnx2fc.
