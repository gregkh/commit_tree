tty: Use raw spin lock to protect the TTY read section

The "normal" spin lock that guards the N_TTY line discipline read section
is replaced by a raw spin lock.

On a PREEMP_RT system this prevents unwanted scheduling overhead when data is
read at the same time as data is being received: while RX IRQ threaded handling
is busy a TTY read call is performed from a RT priority > threaded IRQ priority.
The read call tries to take the read section spin lock (held by the threaded
IRQ) which blocks and causes a context switch to/from the threaded IRQ handler
until the spin lock is unlocked.
