ARC: SMP support

ARC common code to enable a SMP system + ISS provided SMP extensions.

ARC700 natively lacks SMP support, hence some of the core features are
are only enabled if SoCs have the necessary h/w pixie-dust. This
includes:
-Inter Processor Interrupts (IPI)
-Cache coherency
-load-locked/store-conditional
...

The low level exception handling would be completely broken in SMP
because we don't have hardware assisted stack switching. Thus a fair bit
of this code is repurposing the MMU_SCRATCH reg for event handler
prologues to keep them re-entrant.

Many thanks to Rajeshwar Ranga for his initial "major" contributions to
SMP Port (back in 2008), and to Noam Camus and Gilad Ben-Yossef for help
with resurrecting that in 3.2 kernel (2012).

Note that this platform code is again singleton design pattern - so
multiple SMP platforms won't build at the moment - this deficiency is
addressed in subsequent patches within this series.
