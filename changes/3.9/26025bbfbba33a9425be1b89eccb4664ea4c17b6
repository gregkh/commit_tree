metag: System Calls

Add metag system call and gateway page interfaces. The metag
architecture port uses the generic system call numbers from
asm-generic/unistd.h, as well as a user gateway page mapped at
0x6ffff000 which contains fast atomic primitives (depending on SMP) and
a fast method of accessing TLS data.

System calls use the SWITCH instruction with the immediate 0x440001 to
signal a system call.
