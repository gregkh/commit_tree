serial: pch_uart: fix sysrq handling for pch_uart

When PCH_UART_CONSOLE and SERIAL_CORE_CONSOLE is not set neither, the
uart_port will have no 'sysrq' member hence their will need a '#ifdef'
in pch_uart.c to handle the case, otherwise we'll see compile error
like this:

  CC [M]  drivers/tty/serial/pch_uart.o
drivers/tty/serial/pch_uart.c: In function 'pch_uart_hal_read':
drivers/tty/serial/pch_uart.c:572:11: error: 'struct uart_port' has no member named 'sysrq'
make[4]: *** [drivers/tty/serial/pch_uart.o] Error 1
