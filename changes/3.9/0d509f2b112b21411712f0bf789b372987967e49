regmap: Add asynchronous I/O support

Some use cases like firmware download can transfer a lot of data in quick
succession. With high speed buses these use cases can benefit from having
multiple transfers scheduled at once since this allows the bus to minimise
the delay between transfers.

Support this by adding regmap_raw_write_async(), allowing raw transfers to
be scheduled, and regmap_async_complete() to wait for them to finish.
