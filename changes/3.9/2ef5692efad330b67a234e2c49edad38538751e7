ALSA: hda - bug fix on return value when getting HDMI ELD info

In function snd_hdmi_get_eld(), the variable 'ret' should be initialized to 0.
Otherwise it will be returned uninitialized as non-zero after ELD info is got
successfully. Thus hdmi_present_sense() will always assume ELD info is invalid
by mistake, and /proc file system cannot show the proper ELD info.
