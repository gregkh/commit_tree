xen/blkback: Don't trust the handle from the frontend.

The 'handle' is the device that the request is from. For the life-time
of the ring we copy it from a request to a response so that the frontend
is not surprised by it. But we do not need it - when we start processing
I/Os we have our own 'struct phys_req' which has only most essential
information about the request. In fact the 'vbd_translate' ends up
over-writing the preq.dev with a value from the backend.

This assignment of preq.dev with the 'handle' value is superfluous
so lets not do it.
