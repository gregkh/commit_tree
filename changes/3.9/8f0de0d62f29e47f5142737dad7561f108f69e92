ARM: OMAP2+: Get rid of custom OMAP_32K_TIMER_HZ

The timekeeping doesn't depend on HZ value in presence of fine grained
clocksource and hence there should not be any time drift because of HZ
value which was chosen to be divisor of 32768.

OMAP has been using HZ = 128 value to avoid any time drift issues
because of 32768 HZ clock. But with various measurements performed
with HZ = 100, no time drift is observed and it also proves the
point about HZ not having impact on time keeping on OMAP.

Very informative thread on this topic is here:
