NFSv4: Fix another open/open_recovery deadlock

If we don't release the open seqid before we wait for state recovery,
then we may end up deadlocking the state recovery thread.
This patch addresses a new deadlock that was introduced by
commit c21443c2c792cd9b463646d982b0fe48aa6feb0f (NFSv4: Fix a reboot
recovery race when opening a file)
