sfc: Properly sync RX DMA buffer when it is not the last in the page

We may currently allocate two RX DMA buffers to a page, and only unmap
the page when the second is completed.  We do not sync the first RX
buffer to be completed; this can result in packet loss or corruption
if the last RX buffer completed in a NAPI poll is the first in a page
and is not DMA-coherent.  (In the middle of a NAPI poll, we will
handle the following RX completion and unmap the page *before* looking
at the content of the first buffer.)
