perf test: Add a test case for hists__{match,link}

As they are used from diff and event group report, add a test case to
verify their behaviors.

In this test I made a fake machine and two evsel.  Each evsel got 10
samples (so hist entries) - 5 are common and the rests are not.  So
after hists__match() both of them will have 5 entries with pair set.

And the second evsel has a collapsed entry so that the total number is 9
- I made it in order to simulate more realistic case.  Thus after
hists__link the first entry will have 14 entries - 5 are common (w/
pair), 5 are unmatch (w/o pair) and 4 are dummy (w/ pair).  And the
second entry will have 9 entries all have its pair.
