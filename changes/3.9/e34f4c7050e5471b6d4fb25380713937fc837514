l2tp: export l2tp_tunnel_closeall

l2tp_core internally uses l2tp_tunnel_closeall to close all sessions in a
tunnel when a UDP-encapsulation socket is destroyed.  We need to do something
similar for IP-encapsulation sockets.

Export l2tp_tunnel_closeall as a GPL symbol to enable l2tp_ip and l2tp_ip6 to
call it from their .destroy handlers.
