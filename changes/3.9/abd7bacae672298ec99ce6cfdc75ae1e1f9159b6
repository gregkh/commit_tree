serial/8250: Add suport for later SUNIX (TIMEDIA) boards.

Add support for later SUNIX (TIMEDIA) Universal PCI Single and Multi-Port
Communications Boards.

These boards have PCI Vendor ID 1fd4 with device ID 1999 but otherwise
appear to be the same as the TIMEDIA boards already supported by 8250_pci
and parport_serial.

Tested with:

	a. the two port serial board part number SER5037A,
	b. the two port serial and one port parallel board part number
	   MIO5079A.
