tcp: adding a per-socket timestamp offset

This functionality is used for restoring tcp sockets. A tcp timestamp
depends on how long a system has been running, so it's differ for each
host. The solution is to set a per-socket offset.

A per-socket offset for a TIME_WAIT socket is inherited from a proper
tcp socket.

tcp_request_sock doesn't have a timestamp offset, because the repair
mode for them are not implemented.
