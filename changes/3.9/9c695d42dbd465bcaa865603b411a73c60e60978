KVM: Check userspace_addr when modifying a memory slot

The API documents that only flags and guest physical memory space can
be modified on an existing slot, but we don't enforce that the
userspace address cannot be modified.  Instead we just ignore it.
This means that a user may think they've successfully moved both the
guest and user addresses, when in fact only the guest address changed.
Check and error instead.
