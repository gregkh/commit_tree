drm/i915: Always clear semaphore mboxes on seqno wrap

In preparation for setting the seqno to arbitrary value on init or
through debugfs. We need to always clear the semaphores and set the
hws page seqno index by calling intel_ring_init_seqno().

v2: rewrote the commit message as suggested by Chris Wilson.
