mac80211/minstrel_ht: add support for using CCK rates

When MCS rates start to get bad in 2.4 GHz because of long range or
strong interference, CCK rates can be a lot more robust.

This patch adds a pseudo MCS group containing CCK rates (long preamble
in the lower 4 slots, short preamble in the upper slots).
