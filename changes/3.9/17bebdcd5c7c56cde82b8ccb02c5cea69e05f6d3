crypto: bfin_crc - reposition free_irq to avoid access to invalid data

The data referenced by an interrupt handler should not be freed before the
interrupt is ended.  The handler is bfin_crypto_crc_handler.  It may refer
to crc->regs, which is released by the iounmap.

Furthermore, the second argument to all calls to free_irq is incorrect.  It
should be the same as the last argument of request_irq, which is crc,
rather than crc->dev.

The semantic match that finds the first problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@fn exists@
expression list es;
expression a,b;
identifier f;
@@

if (...) {
  ... when any
  free_irq(a,b);
  ... when any
  f(es);
  ... when any
  return ...;
}

@@
expression list fn.es;
expression fn.a,fn.b;
identifier fn.f;
@@

*f(es);
... when any
*free_irq(a,b);
// </smpl>
