ethernet/tulip: DE4x5 needs VIRT_TO_BUS

The automated ARM build tests have shown that the tulip de4x5 driver
uses the old-style virt_to_bus() interface on some architectures.

Alpha, Sparc and PowerPC did not hit this problem, because they
use a different code path, and most other architectures actually
do provide VIRT_TO_BUS.
