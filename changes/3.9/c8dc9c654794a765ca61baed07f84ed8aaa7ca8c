md: raid1,10: Handle REQ_WRITE_SAME flag in write bios

Set mddev queue's max_write_same_sectors to its chunk_sector value (before
disk_stack_limits merges the underlying disk limits.)  With that in place,
be sure to handle writes coming down from the block layer that have the
REQ_WRITE_SAME flag set.  That flag needs to be copied into any newly cloned
write bio.
