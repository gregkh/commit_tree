pcmcia: i82092: fix i82092aa_pci_remove()

Smatch complains because the call to
	pci_set_drvdata(dev, &sockets[i].socket);
is reading one step beyond the end of the sockets[] array.  It will
crash when we use it later.

The only place which uses pci_get_drvdata() is i82092aa_pci_remove().
That function should loop through all the sockets and unregister them.
