x86, mm: Let "memmap=" take more entries one time

Current "memmap=" only can take one entry every time.
when we have more entries, we have to use memmap= for each of them.

For pxe booting, we have command line length limitation, those extra
"memmap=" would waste too much space.

This patch make memmap= could take several entries one time,
and those entries will be split with ','
