fuse: optimize __fuse_direct_io()

__fuse_direct_io() allocates fuse-requests by calling fuse_get_req(fc, n). The
patch calculates 'n' based on iov[] array. This is useful because allocating
FUSE_MAX_PAGES_PER_REQ page pointers and descriptors for each fuse request
would be waste of memory in case of iov-s of smaller size.
