ALSA: hda - Add a new fixup type to override pinctl values

Add a new fixup type, HDA_FIXUP_PINCTLS, for overriding the pinctl
values of the given pins.  It takes the same array of struct pintbl
like HDA_FIXUP_PINS, but each entry contains the pinctl value instead
of the pin default config value.

This patch also replaces the corresponding codes in patch_realtek.c.
Without this change, the direct call of verbs may be overridden again
by the later call of pinctl restoration by the driver.
