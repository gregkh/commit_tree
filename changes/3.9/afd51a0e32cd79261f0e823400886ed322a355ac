x86/acpi: Use __pa_symbol instead of __pa on C visible symbols

This change just updates one spot where __pa was being used when __pa_symbol
should have been used.  By using __pa_symbol we are able to drop a few extra
lines of code as we don't have to test to see if the virtual pointer is a
part of the kernel text or just standard virtual memory.
