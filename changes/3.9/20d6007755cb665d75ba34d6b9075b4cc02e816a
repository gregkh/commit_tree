staging: comedi: vmk80xx: move boardinfo into a const array

The normal way of presenting the board specific information in comedi
drivers is store the data in a static const array. This data is then
accessed using a pointer, normally the comedi_device 'board_ptr',

Move the boardinfo for the two boards supported by this driver from
the vmk80xx_usb_probe() function into a static const array.

Change the access of this information so a pointer is used.
