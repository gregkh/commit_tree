drm/i915: Only apply the mb() when flushing the GTT domain during a finish

Now that we seem to have brought order to the GTT barriers, the last one
to review is the terminal barrier before we unbind the buffer from the
GTT. This needs to only be performed if the buffer still resides in the
GTT domain, and so we can skip some needless barriers otherwise.
