TTY: synclink: Convert + to | for bit operations

Dan Carpenter noticed a missing set of parentheses
around a multiple field addition.

https://lkml.org/lkml/2013/1/27/166

His original commit message:

There is a kind of precedence problem here, but it doesn't affect how
the code works because ->serial_signals is unsigned char.  We want to
clear two flags here.

#define SerialSignal_RTS            0x20     /* Request to Send */
#define SerialSignal_DTR            0x80     /* Data Terminal Ready */

Without the parenthesis then it does:

	info->serial_signals &= 0x5f;

With the parenthesis it does:

	info->serial_signals &= 0xffffff5f;

info->serial_signals is an unsigned char so the two statements are
equivalent, but it's cleaner to add the parenthesis.  In other dtr_rts()
functions the parenthesis are there so this makes it more consistent.

Other changes:

Convert all + uses to | for these bit operations.

Reorder the multiple fields for consistency.
Update the comments too.
