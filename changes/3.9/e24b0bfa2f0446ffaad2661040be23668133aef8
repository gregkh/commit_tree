Revert "drivers/rtc/rtc-at91rm9200.c: use a variable for storing IMR"

This reverts commit 0ef1594c017521ea89278e80fe3f80dafb17abde.

This patch introduced a few races which cannot be easily fixed with a
small follow-up patch. Furthermore, the SoC with the broken hardware
register, which this patch intended to add support for, can only be used
with device trees, which this driver currently does not support.
