x86, mm: Remove parameter in alloc_low_page for 64bit

Now all page table buf are pre-mapped, and could use virtual address directly.
So don't need to remember physical address anymore.

Remove that phys pointer in alloc_low_page(), and that will allow us to merge
alloc_low_page between 64bit and 32bit.
