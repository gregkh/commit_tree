arm: arch_timer: move core to drivers/clocksource

The core functionality of the arch_timer driver is not directly tied to
anything under arch/arm, and can be split out.

This patch factors out the core of the arch_timer driver, so it can be
shared with other architectures. A couple of functions are added so
that architecture-specific code can interact with the driver without
needing to touch its internals.

The ARM_ARCH_TIMER config variable is moved out to
drivers/clocksource/Kconfig, existing uses in arch/arm are replaced with
HAVE_ARM_ARCH_TIMER, which selects it.
