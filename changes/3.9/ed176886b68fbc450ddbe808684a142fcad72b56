ia64 idle: delete stale (*idle)() function pointer

Commit 3e7fc708eb41 ("ia64 idle: delete pm_idle") in 3.9-rc1 didn't
finish the job, leaving an un-initialized reference to (*idle)().

[ Haven't seen a crash from this - but seems like we are just being
  lucky that "idle" is zero so it does get initialized before we jump to
  randomland  - Len ]
