powerpc/mm: Eliminate unneeded for_each_memblock

The only persistent change made by this loop is calling
memblock_set_node() once for each memblock, which is not useful (and has
no effect) as memblock_set_node() is not called with any
memblock-specific parameters.

Subsistute a single memblock_set_node().
