kexec: export PG_hwpoison flag into vmcoreinfo

This patch exports a PG_hwpoison into vmcoreinfo when
CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE is defined.  "makedumpfile" needs to read
information of memory, such as 'mem_section', 'zone', 'pageflags' from
vmcore.

We introduce a function into "makedumpfile" to exclude hwpoison page from
vmcore dump.  In order to introduce this function, PG_hwpoison flag have
to export into vmcoreinfo.
