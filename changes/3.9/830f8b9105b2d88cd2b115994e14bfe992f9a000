arm: plat-orion: fix printing of "MPP config unavailable on this hardware"

refactored printing of the kernel warning:

"orion_mpp_conf: requested MPP%u config unavailable on this hardware\n"

which is not to be printed in case of variant_mask = 0 (unknown variant).
This check should be performed using a logical AND (&&) as opposed
to a bitwise AND (&).

Otherwise, test would fail (and message would not be printed) if
variant_mask != 1
