leds: leds-pwm: Add device tree bindings

The DT binding for the pwm-leds devices are similar to the gpio-leds type.
LEDs are represented as sub-nodes of the pwm-leds device.
The code for handling the DT boot is based on the code found in the
leds-gpio driver and adapted to use PWMs instead of GPIOs.
To avoid having custom cleanup code in case of DT boot the newly created
devm_of_pwm_get() API is used to get the correct PWM instance.

For usage see:
