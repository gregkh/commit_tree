perf tests: Adjust some message log levels to help diagnosing problems in attr tests

Now we'll see the command being run and if it fails, the fields that had
unexpected values and the expected values, example testing a problem in the
next patch:

  # perf test -v 13
  13: struct perf_event_attr setup                           :
  --- start ---
  SNIP
    running 'PERF_TEST_ATTR=/tmp/tmpDNIE6M /home/acme/bin/perf record -o /tmp/tmpDNIE6M/perf.data --group -e cycles,instructions kill >/dev/null 2>&1' ret 0
    running 'PERF_TEST_ATTR=/tmp/tmpV5lKro /home/acme/bin/perf stat -o /tmp/tmpV5lKro/perf.data -dd kill >/dev/null 2>&1' ret 1
  expected config=3, got 65540
  expected exclude_guest=1, got 0
  FAILED '/home/acme/libexec/perf-core/tests/attr/test-stat-detailed-2' - match failure
  ---- end ----
  struct perf_event_attr setup: FAILED!
  #

While in the past we would see at the '-v' level many more messages for the
fields that matched, something we may want to see only in the '-vv' log level.

Keeping the 'running' messages so that we can see the tools tests that
succeeded so that we can compare it to the one that failed, helping pinpointing
the command line switch combo that leads to the problem.
