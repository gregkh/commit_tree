cpufreq: Notify governors when cpus are hot-[un]plugged

Because cpufreq core and governors worry only about the online cpus, if a cpu is
hot [un]plugged, we must notify governors about it, otherwise be ready to expect
something unexpected.

We already have notifiers in the form of CPUFREQ_GOV_START/CPUFREQ_GOV_STOP, we
just need to call them now.
