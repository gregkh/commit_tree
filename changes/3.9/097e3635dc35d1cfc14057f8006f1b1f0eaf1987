iommu: moving initialization earlier

The iommu_init() initializes IOMMU internal structures and data
required for the IOMMU API as iommu_group_alloc().
It is registered as a subsys_initcall now.

One of the IOMMU users is going to be a PCI subsystem on POWER.
It discovers new IOMMU tables during the PCI scan so the logical
place to call iommu_group_alloc() is the moment when a new group
is discovered. However PCI scan is done from subsys_initcall hook
as IOMMU does so PCI hook can be (and is) called before the IOMMU one.

The patch moves IOMMU subsystem initialization one step earlier
to make sure that IOMMU is initialized before PCI scan begins.
