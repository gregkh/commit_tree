staging: comedi: vmk80xx: remove common and unused boardinfo

Some of the information in the boardinfo is common for both boards
supported by this driver. Remove that information from the boardinfo
and just initialize the subdevice values directly.

Also, remove any information in the boardinfo that is not used in
the driver.
