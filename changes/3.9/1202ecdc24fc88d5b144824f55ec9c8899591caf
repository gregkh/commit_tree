[media] v4l: Define video buffer flags for timestamp types

Define video buffer flags for different timestamp types. Everything up to
now have used either realtime clock or monotonic clock, without a way to
tell which clock the timestamp was taken from.
Also document that the clock source of the timestamp in the timestamp field
depends on buffer flags.
