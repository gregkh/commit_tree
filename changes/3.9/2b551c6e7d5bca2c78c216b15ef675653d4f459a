l2tp: close sessions before initiating tunnel delete

When a user deletes a tunnel using netlink, all the sessions in the tunnel
should also be deleted.  Since running sessions will pin the tunnel socket
with the references they hold, have the l2tp_tunnel_delete close all sessions
in a tunnel before finally closing the tunnel socket.
