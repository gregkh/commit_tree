vm: add no-mmu vm_iomap_memory() stub

I think we could just move the full vm_iomap_memory() function into
util.h or similar, but I didn't get any reply from anybody actually
using nommu even to this trivial patch, so I'm not going to touch it any
more than required.

Here's the fairly minimal stub to make the nommu case at least
potentially work.  It doesn't seem like anybody cares, though.
