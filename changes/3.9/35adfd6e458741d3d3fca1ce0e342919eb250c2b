iwlwifi: mvm: Update quota settings for all bindings

The FW scheduler, schedules the bindings over a session of 128
fragments (each is 4 TU long). The quota command should allocate
all the session fragments between all the bindings that require quota
allocation. Currently, use static allocation, where the fragments
are equally distributed between all data bindings.

Note, that not allocating all the session's fragments might cause
the FW scheduler to leave the medium unused.
