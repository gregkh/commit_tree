regulatory: simplify freq_reg_info_regd

The function itself has dual-purpose: it can
retrieve from a given regdomain or from the
globally installed one. Change it to have a
single purpose only: to look up from a given
regdomain. Pass the correct regdomain in the
freq_reg_info() function instead.

This also changes the locking rules for it,
no locking is required any more.
