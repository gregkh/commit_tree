ARM: KVM: VGIC accept vcpu and dist base addresses from user space

User space defines the model to emulate to a guest and should therefore
decide which addresses are used for both the virtual CPU interface
directly mapped in the guest physical address space and for the emulated
distributor interface, which is mapped in software by the in-kernel VGIC
support.
