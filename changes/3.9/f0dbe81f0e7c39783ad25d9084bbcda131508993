posix-timers: Fix clock_adjtime to always return timex data on success

The clock_adj call returns the clock state on success, which may be a
non-zero value (e.g. TIME_INS), but the modified timex data is copied
back to the user only when zero value (TIME_OK) was returned. Fix the
condition to copy the data also with positive return values.
