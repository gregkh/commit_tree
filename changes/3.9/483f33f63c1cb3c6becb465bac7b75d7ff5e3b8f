pinctrl: add pinconf-generic defines for output

This adds a definition of a generic output configuration
for a certain pin when using the generic pin configuration
library. Whereas driving pins low/high is usually a GPIO
business, you may want to set up pins into a default state
using hogs, and never touch them again. This helps out
with that scenario.

Based on a patch from Patrice Chotard.
