md: expedite metadata update when switching  read-auto -> active

If something has failed while the array was read-auto,
then when we switch to 'active' we need to update the metadata.
This will happen anyway but it is good to expedite it, and
also to ensure any failed device has been released by the
underlying device before we try to action the ioctl which
caused us to switch to 'active' mode.
