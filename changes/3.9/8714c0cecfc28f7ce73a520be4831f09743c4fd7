video: add display_timing and videomode

Add display_timing structure and the according helper functions. This allows
the description of a display via its supported timing parameters.

Also, add helper functions to convert from display timings to a generic videomode
structure.

The struct display_timing specifies all needed parameters to describe the signal
properties of a display in one mode. This includes
    - ranges for signals that may have min-, max- and typical values
    - single integers for signals that can be on, off or are ignored
    - booleans for signals that are either on or off

As a display may support multiple modes like this, a struct display_timings is
added, that holds all given struct display_timing pointers and declares the
native mode of the display.

Although a display may state that a signal can be in a range, it is driven with
fixed values that indicate a videomode. Therefore graphic drivers don't need all
the information of struct display_timing, but would generate a videomode from
the given set of supported signal timings and work with that.

The video subsystems all define their own structs that describe a mode and work
with that (e.g. fb_videomode or drm_display_mode). To slowly replace all those
various structures and allow code reuse across those subsystems, add struct
videomode as a generic description.

This patch only includes the most basic fields in struct videomode. All missing
fields that are needed to have a really generic video mode description can be
added at a later stage.
