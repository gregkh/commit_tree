memory-hotplug: do not allocate pgdat if it was not freed when offline.

Since there is no way to guarentee the address of pgdat/zone is not on
stack of any kernel threads or used by other kernel objects without
reference counting or other symchronizing method, we cannot reset
node_data and free pgdat when offlining a node.  Just reset pgdat to 0
and reuse the memory when the node is online again.

The problem is suggested by Kamezawa Hiroyuki.  The idea is from Wen
Congyang.

NOTE: If we don't reset pgdat to 0, the WARN_ON in free_area_init_node()
      will be triggered.
