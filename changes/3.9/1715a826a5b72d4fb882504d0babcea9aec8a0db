powerpc: Add DSCR support to ptrace

The DSCR (aka Data Stream Control Register) is supported on some
server PowerPC chips and allow some control over the prefetch
of data streams.

The kernel already supports DSCR value per thread but there is also
a need in a ability to change it from an external process for
the specific pid.

The patch adds new register index PT_DSCR (index=44) which can be
set/get by:
  ptrace(PTRACE_POKEUSER, traced_process, PT_DSCR << 3, dscr);
  dscr = ptrace(PTRACE_PEEKUSER, traced_process, PT_DSCR << 3, NULL);

The patch does not increase PT_REGS_COUNT as the pt_regs struct has not
been changed.
