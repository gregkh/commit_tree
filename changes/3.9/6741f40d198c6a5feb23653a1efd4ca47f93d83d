DM9000B: driver initialization upgrade

Fix bug for DM9000 revision B which contain a DSP PHY

DM9000B use DSP PHY instead previouse DM9000 revisions' analog PHY,
So need extra change in initialization, For
explicity PHY Reset and PHY init parameter, and
first DM9000_NCR reset need NCR_MAC_LBK bit by dm9000_probe().

Following DM9000_NCR reset cause by dm9000_open() clear the
NCR_MAC_LBK bit.

Without this fix, Power-up FIFO pointers error happen around 2%
rate among Davicom's customers' boards. With this fix, All above
cases can be solved.
