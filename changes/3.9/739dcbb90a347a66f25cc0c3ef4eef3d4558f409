ACPICA: Cleanup source to reduce differences between Linux and ACPICA.

This is a cosmetic patch only. Comparison of the resulting binary showed
only line number differences.

This patch does not affect the generation of the Linux binary.
This patch decreases 389 lines of 20121018 divergence.diff.

This patch reduces source code diff caused by the simple code maintenance
work:
1. Deletion of the unused include files.
2. Deletion of the deprecated codes blocks.
3. Repositioning of the code blocks.
4. Replacing the values with the well defined macros.
5. Replacing the types with the equivalent types.
