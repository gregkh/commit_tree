xen-netback: cancel the credit timer when taking the vif down

If the credit timer is left armed after calling
xen_netbk_remove_xenvif(), then it may fire and attempt to schedule
the vif which will then oops as vif->netbk == NULL.

This may happen both in the fatal error path and during normal
disconnection from the front end.

The sequencing during shutdown is critical to ensure that: a)
vif->netbk doesn't become unexpectedly NULL; and b) the net device/vif
is not freed.

1. Mark as unschedulable (netif_carrier_off()).
2. Synchronously cancel the timer.
3. Remove the vif from the schedule list.
4. Remove it from it netback thread group.
5. Wait for vif->refcnt to become 0.
