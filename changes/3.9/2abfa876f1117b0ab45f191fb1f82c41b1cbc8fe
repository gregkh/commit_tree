cpufreq: handle SW coordinated CPUs

This patch fixes a bug that occurred when we had load on a secondary CPU
and the primary CPU was sleeping. Only one sampling timer was spawned
and it was spawned as a deferred timer on the primary CPU, so when a
secondary CPU had a change in load this was not detected by the cpufreq
governor (both ondemand and conservative).

This patch make sure that deferred timers are run on all CPUs in the
case of software controlled CPUs that run on the same frequency.
