cpufreq: Retrieve current frequency from scaling drivers with internal governors

Scaling drivers that implement the cpufreq_driver.setpolicy() versus
the cpufreq_driver.target() interface do not set policy->cur.

Normally policy->cur is set during the call to cpufreq_driver.target()
when the frequnecy request is made by the governor.

If the scaling driver implements cpufreq_driver.setpolicy() and
cpufreq_driver.get() interfaces use cpufreq_driver.get() to retrieve
the current frequency.
