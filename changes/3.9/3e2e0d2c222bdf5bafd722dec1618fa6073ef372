tile: comment assumption about __insn_mtspr for <asm/irqflags.h>

The arch_local_irq_save(), etc., routines are required to function
as compiler barriers.  They do, but it's subtle and requires knowing
that the gcc builtin __insn_mtspr() is marked as a memory clobber.
Provide a comment explaining the assumption.
