workqueue: make GCWQ_FREEZING a pool flag

Make GCWQ_FREEZING a pool flag POOL_FREEZING.  This patch doesn't
change locking - FREEZING on both pools of a CPU are set or clear
together while holding gcwq->lock.  It shouldn't cause any functional
difference.

This leaves gcwq->flags w/o any flags.  Removed.

While at it, convert BUG_ON()s in freeze_workqueue_begin() and
thaw_workqueues() to WARN_ON_ONCE().

This is part of an effort to remove global_cwq and make worker_pool
the top level abstraction, which in turn will help implementing worker
pools with user-specified attributes.
