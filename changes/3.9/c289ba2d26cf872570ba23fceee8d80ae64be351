goldfish: framebuffer driver

Framebuffer support for the Goldfish emulator.  This takes the Google
emulator and applies the x86 cleanups as well as moving the blank
methods to the usual Linux place and dropping the Android early suspend
logic (for now at least, that can be looked at as Android and upstream
converge).  Dropped various oddities like setting MTRRs on a virtual
frame buffer emulation...

With the drivers so far you can now boot a Linux initrd and have fun.

[sheng@linux.intel.com: cleaned up to handle x86]
[thomas.keel@intel.com: ported to 3.4]
[alan@linux.intel.com: cleaned up for style and 3.7, moved blank methods]
[akpm@linux-foundation.org: fix (silly) sparse warnings]
