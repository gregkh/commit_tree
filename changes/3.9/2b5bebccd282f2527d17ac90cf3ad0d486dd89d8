[SCSI] st: Take additional queue ref in st_probe

This patch fixes a reference count bug in the SCSI tape driver which can be
reproduced with the following:

* Boot with slub_debug=FZPU, tape drive attached
* echo 1 > /sys/devices/... tape device pci path .../remove
* Wait for device removal
* echo 1 > /sys/kernel/slab/blkdev_queue/validate
* Slub debug complains about corrupted poison pattern

In commit 523e1d39 (block: make gendisk hold a reference to its queue)
add_disk() and disk_release() were modified to get/put an additional
reference on a disk queue to fix a reference counting discrepency
between bdev release and SCSI device removal.  The ST driver never
calls add_disk(), so this commit introduced an extra kref put when the
ST driver frees its struct gendisk.

Attempts were made to fix this bug at the block level [1] but later
abandoned due to floppy driver issues [2].
