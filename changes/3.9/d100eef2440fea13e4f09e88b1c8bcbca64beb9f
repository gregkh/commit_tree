ext4: lookup block mapping in extent status tree

After tracking all extent status, we already have a extent cache in
memory.  Every time we want to lookup a block mapping, we can first
try to lookup it in extent status tree to avoid a potential disk I/O.

A new function called ext4_es_lookup_extent is defined to finish this
work.  When we try to lookup a block mapping, we always call
ext4_map_blocks and/or ext4_da_map_blocks.  So in these functions we
first try to lookup a block mapping in extent status tree.

A new flag EXT4_GET_BLOCKS_NO_PUT_HOLE is used in ext4_da_map_blocks
in order not to put a hole into extent status tree because this hole
will be converted to delayed extent in the tree immediately.
