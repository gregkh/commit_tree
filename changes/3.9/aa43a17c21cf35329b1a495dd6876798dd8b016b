btrfs: handle null fs_info in btrfs_panic()

At least backref_tree_panic() can apparently pass
in a null fs_info, so handle that in __btrfs_panic
to get the message out on the console.

The btrfs_panic macro also uses fs_info, but that's
largely pointless; it's testing to see if
BTRFS_MOUNT_PANIC_ON_FATAL_ERROR is not set.
But if it *were* set, __btrfs_panic() would have,
well, paniced and we wouldn't be here, testing it!
So just BUG() at this point.

And since we only use fs_info once now, just use it
directly.
