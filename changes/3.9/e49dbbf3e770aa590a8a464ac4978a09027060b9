nfsd: fix bad offset use

vfs_writev() updates the offset argument - but the code then passes the
offset to vfs_fsync_range(). Since offset now points to the offset after
what was just written, this is probably not what was intended

Introduced by face15025ffdf664de95e86ae831544154d26c9c "nfsd: use
vfs_fsync_range(), not O_SYNC, for stable writes".
