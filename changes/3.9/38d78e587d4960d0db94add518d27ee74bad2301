mqueue: sys_mq_open: do not call mnt_drop_write() if read-only

mnt_drop_write() must be called only if mnt_want_write() succeeded,
otherwise the mnt_writers counter will diverge.

mnt_writers counters are used to check if remounting FS as read-only is
OK, so after an extra mnt_drop_write() call, it would be impossible to
remount mqueue FS as read-only.  Besides, on umount a warning would be
printed like this one:

  =====================================
  [ BUG: bad unlock balance detected! ]
  3.9.0-rc3 #5 Not tainted
  -------------------------------------
  a.out/12486 is trying to release lock (sb_writers) at:
  mnt_drop_write+0x1f/0x30
  but there are no more locks to release!
