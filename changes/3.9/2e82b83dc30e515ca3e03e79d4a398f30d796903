goldfish: audio support

(remove change to another file that escaped into the patch set)

From: Mike Lockwood <lockwood@google.com>

Provide a simple audio channel between the kernel and the emulator that host
sit. Queued for staging right now as this ought to be an ALSA driver not
just a dumb device of its own making.
