xen-blkback: don't store dev_bus_addr

dev_bus_addr returned in the grant ref map operation is the mfn of the
passed page, there's no need to store it in the persistent grant
entry, since we can always get it provided that we have the page.

This reduces the memory overhead of persistent grants in blkback.

While at it, rename the 'seg[i].buf' to be 'seg[i].offset' as
it makes much more sense - as we use that value in bio_add_page
which as the fourth argument expects the offset.

We hadn't used the physical address as part of this at all.
