cfg80211: fix station change if TDLS isn't supported

Larry noticed (and bisected) that commit df881293c6ba9a12868491a717b25
"cfg80211: Pass TDLS peer's QoS/HT/VHT information during set_station"
broke secure connections. This is is the case only for drivers that
don't support TDLS, where any kind of change, even just the change of
authorized flag that is required for normal operation, was rejected
now. To fix this, remove the checks. I have some patches that will add
proper verification for all the different cases later.
