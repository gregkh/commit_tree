net: cdc_ncm, cdc_mbim: allow user to prefer NCM for backwards compatibility

commit bd329e1 ("net: cdc_ncm: do not bind to NCM compatible MBIM devices")
introduced a new policy, preferring MBIM for dual NCM/MBIM functions if
the cdc_mbim driver was enabled.  This caused a regression for users
wanting to use NCM.

Devices implementing NCM backwards compatibility according to section
3.2 of the MBIM v1.0 specification allow either NCM or MBIM on a single
USB function, using different altsettings.  The cdc_ncm and cdc_mbim
drivers will both probe such functions, and must agree on a common
policy for selecting either MBIM or NCM.  Until now, this policy has
been set at build time based on CONFIG_USB_NET_CDC_MBIM.

Use a module parameter to set the system policy at runtime, allowing the
user to prefer NCM on systems with the cdc_mbim driver.
