s390/virtio-ccw: Fix setup_vq error handling.

virtio_ccw_setup_vq() failed to unwind correctly on errors. In
particular, it failed to delete the virtqueue on errors, leading to
list corruption when virtio_ccw_del_vqs() iterated over a virtqueue
that had not been added to the vcdev's list.

Fix this with redoing the error unwinding in virtio_ccw_setup_vq(),
using a single path for all errors.
