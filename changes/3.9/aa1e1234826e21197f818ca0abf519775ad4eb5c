staging/vt6656: Fix too large integer constant warning on 32-bit

drivers/staging/vt6656/card.c: In function ‘CARDqGetNextTBTT’:
drivers/staging/vt6656/card.c:793: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘unsigned long’ type

Commit c7b7cad0d8df823ea063c86a54316bbcbfa04a7c ("staging/vt6656: Fix
sparse warning constant 0xffffffff00000000U is so big it is unsigned long")
changed the constant to "0xffffffff00000000UL", but that only works on
64-bit.  Change it "0xffffffff00000000ULL" to fix it for 32-bit, too.
