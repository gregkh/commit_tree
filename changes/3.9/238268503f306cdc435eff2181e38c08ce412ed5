bnx2x: align define usage to satisfy static checkers

Static checkers complained that the E1H_FUNC_MAX define is used
incorrectly in bnx2x_pretend_func(). The complaint was justified,
although its not a real bug, as the first part of the conditional
protects us in this case (a real bug would happen if a VF tried to
use the pretend func, but there are no VFs in E1H chips).
