f2fs: clarify and enhance the f2fs_gc flow

This patch makes clearer the ambiguous f2fs_gc flow as follows.

1. Remove intermediate checkpoint condition during f2fs_gc
 (i.e., should_do_checkpoint() and GC_BLOCKED)

2. Remove unnecessary return values of f2fs_gc because of #1.
 (i.e., GC_NODE, GC_OK, etc)

3. Simplify write_checkpoint() because of #2.

4. Clarify the main f2fs_gc flow.
 o monitor how many freed sections during one iteration of do_garbage_collect().
 o do GC more without checkpoints if we can't get enough free sections.
 o do checkpoint once we've got enough free sections through forground GCs.

5. Adopt thread-logging (Slack-Space-Recycle) scheme more aggressively on data
  log types. See. get_ssr_segement()
