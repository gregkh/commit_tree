libata: handle power transition of ODD

When ata port is runtime suspended, it will check if the ODD attched to
it is a zero power(ZP) capable ODD and if the ZP capable ODD is in zero
power ready state. And if this is not the case, the highest acpi state
will be limited to ACPI_STATE_D3_HOT to avoid powering off the ODD. And
if the ODD can be powered off, runtime wake capability needs to be
enabled and powered_off flag will be set to let resume code knows that
the ODD was in powered off state.

And on resume, before it is powered on, if it was powered off during
suspend, runtime wake capability needs to be disabled. After it is
recovered, the ODD is considered functional, post power on processing
like eject tray if the ODD is drawer type is done, and several ZPODD
related fields will also be reset.
