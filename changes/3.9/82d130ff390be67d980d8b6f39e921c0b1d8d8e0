Btrfs: fix wrong return value of btrfs_lookup_csum()

If we don't find the expected csum item, but find a csum item which is
adjacent to the specified extent, we should return -EFBIG, or we should
return -ENOENT. But btrfs_lookup_csum() return -EFBIG even the csum item
is not adjacent to the specified extent. Fix it.
