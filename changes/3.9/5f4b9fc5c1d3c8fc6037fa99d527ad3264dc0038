HWPOISON: change order of error_states[]'s elements

error_states[] has two separate states "unevictable LRU page" and
"mlocked LRU page", and the former one has the higher priority now.  But
because of that the latter one is rarely chosen because pages with
PageMlocked highly likely have PG_unevictable set.  On the other hand,
PG_unevictable without PageMlocked is common for ramfs or SHM_LOCKed
shared memory, so reversing the priority of these two states helps us
clearly distinguish them.
