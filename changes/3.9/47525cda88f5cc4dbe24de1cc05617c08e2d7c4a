ACPI / PCI: Fold acpi_pci_root_start() into acpi_pci_root_add()

Move the code from the ACPI PCI root bridge's .start() callback
routine, acpi_pci_root_start(), directly into acpi_pci_root_add()
and drop acpi_pci_root_start().

It is safe to do that, because it is now always guaranteed that
when struct pci_dev objects are created, their companion struct
acpi_device objects are already present, so it is not necessary to
wait for them to be created before calling pci_bus_add_devices().

This change was previously proposed in a different form by
Yinghai Lu.
