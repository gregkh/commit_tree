libceph: kill ceph_osdc_create_event() "one_shot" parameter

There is only one caller of ceph_osdc_create_event(), and it
provides 0 as its "one_shot" argument.  Get rid of that argument and
just use 0 in its place.

Replace the code in handle_watch_notify() that executes if one_shot
is nonzero in the event with a BUG_ON() call.

While modifying "osd_client.c", give handle_watch_notify() static
scope.
