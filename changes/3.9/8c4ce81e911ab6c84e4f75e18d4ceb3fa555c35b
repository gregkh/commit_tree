Btrfs: do not change inode flags in rename

Before we forced to change a file's NOCOW and COMPRESS flag due to
the parent directory's, but this ends up a bad idea, because it
confuses end users a lot about file's NOCOW status, eg. if someone
change a file to NOCOW via 'chattr' and then rename it in the current
directory which is without NOCOW attribute, the file will lose the
NOCOW flag silently.

This diables 'change flags in rename', so from now on we'll only
inherit flags from the parent directory on creation stage while in
other places we can use 'chattr' to set NOCOW or COMPRESS flags.
