tracing: Remove tracepoint sample code

The tracepoint sample code was used to teach developers how to
create their own tracepoints. But now the trace_events have been
added as a higher level that is used directly by developers today.

Only the trace_event code should use the tracepoint interface
directly and no new tracepoints should be added.

Besides, the example had a race condition with the use of the
 ->d_name.name dentry field, as pointed out by Al Viro.

Best just to remove the code so it wont be used by other developers.
