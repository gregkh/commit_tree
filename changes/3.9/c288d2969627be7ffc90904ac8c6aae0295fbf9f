ext2: Fix BUG_ON in evict() on inode deletion

Commit 8e3dffc6 introduced a regression where deleting inode with
large extended attributes leads to triggering
  BUG_ON(inode->i_state != (I_FREEING | I_CLEAR))
in fs/inode.c:evict(). That happens because freeing of xattr block
dirtied the inode and it happened after clear_inode() has been called.

Fix the issue by moving removal of xattr block into ext2_evict_inode()
before clear_inode() call close to a place where data blocks are
truncated. That is also more logical place and removes surprising
requirement that ext2_free_blocks() mustn't dirty the inode.
