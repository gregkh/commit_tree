ktest: Remove indexes from warnings check

The index of a line where a warning is tested can be returned
differently on different versions of gcc (or same version compiled
differently). That is, a tab + space can give different results. This
causes the warning check to produce a false positive. Removing the
index from the check fixes this issue.
