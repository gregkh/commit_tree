ext4: use module parameters instead of debugfs for mballoc_debug

There are multiple reasons to move away from debugfs.  First of all,
we are only using it for a single parameter, and it is much more
complicated to set up (some 30 lines of code compared to 3), and one
more thing that might fail while loading the ext4 module.

Secondly, as a module paramter it can be specified as a boot option if
ext4 is built into the kernel, or as a parameter when the module is
loaded, and it can also be manipulated dynamically under
/sys/module/ext4/parameters/mballoc_debug.  So it is more flexible.

Ultimately we want to move away from using mb_debug() towards
tracepoints, but for now this is still a useful simplification of the
code base.
