tty: serial: fix typo "SERIAL_S3C2412"

The Kconfig symbol SERIAL_S3C2412 got removed in commit
da121506eb03ee5daea55404709110b798bd61d9 ("serial: samsung: merge
probe() function from all SoC specific extensions"). But it also added a
last reference to that symbol. The commit and the tree make clear that
CPU_S3C2412 should have been used instead.
