usb: musb: set AUTOSET for full speed bulk DMA transfer in host mode

The "mult" factor is not updated properly for the can_bulk_split()
case.

The AUTOSET bit in the TXCSR is not being set if the "mult"
factor is greater than 1 for the High Bandwidth ISO case.
But the "mult" factor is also greater than 1 in case of Full speed
bulk transfers with the packet splitting in TXMAXP register
enabled with can_bulk_split().

Without the AUTOSET the DMA transfers will not progress in mode1
