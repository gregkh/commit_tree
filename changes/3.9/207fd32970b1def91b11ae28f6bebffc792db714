drm/fb-helper: improve kerneldoc

Now that the fbdev helper interface for drivers is trimmed down,
update the kerneldoc for all the remaining exported functions.

I've tried to beat the DocBook a bit by reordering the function
references a bit into a more sensible ordering. But that didn't work
out at all. Hence just extend the in-code DOC: section a bit.

Also remove the LOCKING: sections - especially for the setup functions
they're totally bogus. But that's not a documentation problem, but
simply an artifact of the current rather hazardous locking around drm
init and even more so around fbdev setup ...

v2: Some further improvements:
- Also add documentation for drm_fb_helper_single_add_all_connectors,
  Dave Airlie didn't want me to kill this one from the fb helper
  interface.
- Update docs for drm_fb_helper_fill_var/fix - they should be used
  from the driver's ->fb_probe callback to setup the fbdev info
  structure.
- Clarify what the ->fb_probe callback should all do - it needs to
  setup both the fbdev info and allocate the drm framebuffer used as
  backing storage.
- Add basic documentaation for the drm_fb_helper_funcs driver callback
  vfunc.

v3: Implement clarifications Laurent Pinchart suggested in his review.

v4: Fix another mispelling Laurent spotted.
