Input: sysrq - allow specifying alternate reset sequence

This patch adds keyreset functionality to the sysrq driver. It allows
certain button/key combinations to be used in order to trigger emergency
reboots.

Redefining the '__weak platform_sysrq_reset_seq' variable is required
to trigger the feature.  Alternatively keys can be passed to the driver
via a module parameter.

This functionality comes from the keyreset driver submitted by
Arve Hjønnevåg in the Android kernel.
