x86-32: Add support for 64bit get_user()

Implement __get_user_8() for x86-32. It will return the
64-bit result in edx:eax register pair, and ecx is used
to pass in the address and return the error value.

For consistency, change the register assignment for all
other __get_user_x() variants, so that address is passed in
ecx/rcx, the error value is returned in ecx/rcx, and eax/rax
contains the actual value.

[ hpa: I modified the patch so that it does NOT change the calling
  conventions for the existing callsites, this also means that the code
  is completely unchanged for 64 bits.

  Instead, continue to use eax for address input/error output and use
  the ecx:edx register pair for the output. ]

This is a partial refresh of a patch [1] by Jamie Lokier from
2004. Only the minimal changes to implement 64bit get_user()
were picked from the original patch.
