ARM: 7685/1: delay: use private ticks_per_jiffy field for timer-based delay ops

Commit 70264367a243 ("ARM: 7653/2: do not scale loops_per_jiffy when
using a constant delay clock") fixed a problem with our timer-based
delay loop, where loops_per_jiffy is scaled by cpufreq yet used directly
by the timer delay ops.

This patch fixes the problem in a more elegant way by keeping a private
ticks_per_jiffy field in the delay ops, independent of loops_per_jiffy
and therefore not subject to scaling. The loop-based delay continues to
use loops_per_jiffy directly, as it should.
