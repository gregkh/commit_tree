ipack/devices/ipoctal: fix kernel bug when using pppd

Trying to setup the pppd server to use ipoctal's serial ports, it says the ports
are busy the first time. If the operation is repeated, a kernel bug due to a
dereference of a NULL pointer appears.

Removing the one-access-only setup from the driver, removes this kernel bug.
