ARM: 7661/1: mm: perform explicit branch predictor maintenance when required

The ARM ARM requires branch predictor maintenance if, for a given ASID,
the instructions at a specific virtual address appear to change.

From the kernel's point of view, that means:

	- Changing the kernel's view of memory (e.g. switching to the
	  identity map)
	- ASID rollover (since ASIDs will be re-allocated to new tasks)

This patch adds explicit branch predictor maintenance when either of the
two conditions above are met.
