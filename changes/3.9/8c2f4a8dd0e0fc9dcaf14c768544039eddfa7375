ARC: UAPI Disintegrate arch/arc/include/asm

1. ./genfilelist.pl arch/arc/include/asm/

2. Create arch/arc/include/uapi/asm/Kbuild as follows

	+# UAPI Header export list
	+include include/uapi/asm-generic/Kbuild.asm

3. ./disintegrate-one.pl arch/arc/include/{,uapi/}asm/<above-list>

4. Edit arch/arc/include/asm/Kbuild to remove ref to
	asm-generic/Kbuild.asm

- To work around empty uapi/asm/setup.h added a placholder comment.
- Also a manual #ifdef __ASSEMBLY__ for a late ptrace change
