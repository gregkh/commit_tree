KVM: Write protect the updated slot only when dirty logging is enabled

Calling kvm_mmu_slot_remove_write_access() for a deleted slot does
nothing but search for non-existent mmu pages which have mappings to
that deleted memory; this is safe but a waste of time.

Since we want to make the function rmap based in a later patch, in a
manner which makes it unsafe to be called for a deleted slot, we makes
the caller see if the slot is non-zero and being dirty logged.
