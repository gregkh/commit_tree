HID: LG: Add support for Logitech Momo Force (Red) Wheel

This patch provides a modified report descriptor to split accelerator
and brake, and adds the 'NO_GET' flag to prevent it hanging on
connection.

Note: for convience this patch is against the follow patch which was applied
earlier this week.
