cfg80211: advertise extended capabilities to userspace

In many cases, userspace may need to know which of the
802.11 extended capabilities ("Extended Capabilities
element") are implemented in the driver or device, to
include them e.g. in beacons, assoc request/response
or other frames. Add a new nl80211 attribute to hold
the extended capabilities bitmap for this.
