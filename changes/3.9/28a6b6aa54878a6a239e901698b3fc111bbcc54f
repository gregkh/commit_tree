perf session: There is no need for a per session hists instance

It was being used just for its stats member, so ditch session->hists and
use just what is needed, session->stats.

This completes the move support multiple events in the hists layer, the
last user of session->hists was 'perf diff' but Jiri Olsa has fixed that
some time ago.
