perf record: Don't pass host machine to guest synthesizer

We were calling perf_session__process_machines(), that would first pass
the struct machine associated with the host to the provided callback,
perf_event__synthesize_guest_os() that would test if it was the host and
if so wouldn't do anything.

Ditch this contraption, just call directly machines__process with the
list of guests.
