sctp: Use correct sideffect command in duplicate cookie handling

When SCTP is done processing a duplicate cookie chunk, it tries
to delete a newly created association.  For that, it has to set
the right association for the side-effect processing to work.
However, when it uses the SCTP_CMD_NEW_ASOC command, that performs
more work then really needed (like hashing the associationa and
assigning it an id) and there is no point to do that only to
delete the association as a next step.  In fact, it also creates
an impossible condition where an association may be found by
the getsockopt() call, and that association is empty.  This
causes a crash in some sctp getsockopts.

The solution is rather simple.  We simply use SCTP_CMD_SET_ASOC
command that doesn't have all the overhead and does exactly
what we need.
