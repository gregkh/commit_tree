mac80211: stop toggling IEEE80211_HT_CAP_SUP_WIDTH_20_40

For VHT, many more bandwidth changes are possible. As a first
step, stop toggling the IEEE80211_HT_CAP_SUP_WIDTH_20_40 flag
in the HT capabilities and instead introduce a bandwidth field
indicating the currently usable bandwidth to transmit to the
station. Of course, make all drivers use it.

To achieve this, make ieee80211_ht_cap_ie_to_sta_ht_cap() get
the station as an argument, rather than the new capabilities,
so it can set up the new bandwidth field.

If the station is a VHT station and VHT bandwidth is in use,
also set the bandwidth accordingly.

Doing this allows us to get rid of the supports_40mhz flag as
the HT capabilities now reflect the true capability instead of
the current setting.

While at it, also fix ieee80211_ht_cap_ie_to_sta_ht_cap() to not
ignore HT cap overrides when MCS TX isn't supported (not that it
really happens...)
