iio:max1363 remove some functions left after merge

merge commit 17cb3be61b45d716f6b21a9380925493413ce0ed
seems to have resulted in two functions that were removed in
4389fbec5b8fd0577c1e854ff5d7139329558c20 reappearing.

Spotted due to a build kicking out

drivers/iio/adc/max1363.c:1486:12: warning: 'max1363_register_buffered_funcs_and_init' defined but not used
drivers/iio/adc/max1363.c:1521:13: warning: 'max1363_buffer_cleanup' defined but not used

This patch just removes them again.
