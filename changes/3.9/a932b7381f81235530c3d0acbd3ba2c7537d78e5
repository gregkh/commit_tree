uprobes/tracing: Kill uprobe_trace_consumer, embed uprobe_consumer into trace_uprobe

trace_uprobe->consumer and "struct uprobe_trace_consumer" add the
unnecessary indirection and complicate the code for no reason.

This patch simply embeds uprobe_consumer into "struct trace_uprobe",
all other changes only fix the compilation errors.
