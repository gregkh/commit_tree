ax25: fix info leak via msg_name in ax25_recvmsg()

When msg_namelen is non-zero the sockaddr info gets filled out, as
requested, but the code fails to initialize the padding bytes of struct
sockaddr_ax25 inserted by the compiler for alignment. Additionally the
msg_namelen value is updated to sizeof(struct full_sockaddr_ax25) but is
not always filled up to this size.

Both issues lead to the fact that the code will leak uninitialized
kernel stack bytes in net/socket.c.

Fix both issues by initializing the memory with memset(0).
