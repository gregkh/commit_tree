irq: Remove IRQ_EXIT_OFFSET workaround

The IRQ_EXIT_OFFSET trick was used to make sure the irq
doesn't get preempted after we substract the HARDIRQ_OFFSET
until we are entirely done with any code in irq_exit().

This workaround was necessary because some archs may call
irq_exit() with irqs enabled and there is still some code
in the end of this function that is not covered by the
HARDIRQ_OFFSET but want to stay non-preemptible.

Now that irq are always disabled in irq_exit(), the whole code
is guaranteed not to be preempted. We can thus remove this hack.
