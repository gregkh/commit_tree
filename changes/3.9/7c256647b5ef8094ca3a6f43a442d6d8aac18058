staging: tidspbridge: fix potential array out of bounds write

The name of the firmware (drv_datap->base_img) could potentially
become equal to 255 valid characters (size of exec_file), this
will result in an out of bounds write, given that the 255 chars
along with a '\0' terminator will be copied into an array of
255 chars.

Produce an error on this cases, because the driver expects the NULL
ending to be among the 255 char limit.
