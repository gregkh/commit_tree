drm/i915: Add "Automatic" mode for the "Broadcast RGB" property

Add a new "Automatic" mode to the "Broadcast RGB" range property.
When selected the driver automagically selects between full range and
limited range output.

Based on CEA-861 [1] guidelines, limited range output is selected if the
mode is a CEA mode, except 640x480. Otherwise full range output is used.
Additionally DVI monitors should most likely default to full range
always.

As per DP1.2a [2] DisplayPort should always use full range for 18bpp, and
otherwise will follow CEA-861 rules.

NOTE: The default value for the property will now be "Automatic"
so some people may be affected in case they're relying on the
current full range default.
