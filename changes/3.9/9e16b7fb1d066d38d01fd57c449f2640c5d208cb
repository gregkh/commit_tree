mm,ksm: swapoff might need to copy

Before establishing that KSM page migration was the cause of my
WARN_ON_ONCE(page_mapped(page))s, I suspected that they came from the
lack of a ksm_might_need_to_copy() in swapoff's unuse_pte() - which in
many respects is equivalent to faulting in a page.

In fact I've never caught that as the cause: but in theory it does at
least need the KSM_RUN_UNMERGE check in ksm_might_need_to_copy(), to
avoid bringing a KSM page back in when it's not supposed to be.

I intended to copy how it's done in do_swap_page(), but have a strong
aversion to how "swapcache" ends up being used there: rework it with
"page != swapcache".
