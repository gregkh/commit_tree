w1_therm: Retries: remove old code add CRC

w1_therm includes some obsolete code to detect bad_roms, this is no
longer relevant.
The retry code is only used for this bad_rom test, however there is a
CRC check that detects a bad read, but does not trigger a retry. This
patch removes all the bad_rom code and uses the CRC check to trigger
retries.
