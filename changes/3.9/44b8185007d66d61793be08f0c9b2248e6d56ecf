staging/xgifb: Remove unused entries in XGI340New_MCLKData and XGI27New_MCLKData

In the lookup tables XGI340New_MCLKData and XGI27New_MCLKData only the
first three 'lines' are used, thus the remaining fields can be removed.

Rationale:
- vb_init.c uses pVBInfo->ram_type as the index for pVBInfo->MCLKData

- pVBInfo->ram_type is assigned the return value of
XGINew_GetXG20DRAMType which can only be 0, 1 or 2

- pVBInfo->MCLKData is assigned to either XGI340New_MCLKData or
XGI27New_MCLKData in vb_setmode.c

-> only the first three values are used, the rest can be removed.
