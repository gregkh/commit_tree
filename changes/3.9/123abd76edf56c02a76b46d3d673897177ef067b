efivars: efivarfs_valid_name() should handle pstore syntax

Stricter validation was introduced with commit da27a24383b2b
("efivarfs: guid part of filenames are case-insensitive") and commit
47f531e8ba3b ("efivarfs: Validate filenames much more aggressively"),
which is necessary for the guid portion of efivarfs filenames, but we
don't need to be so strict with the first part, the variable name. The
UEFI specification doesn't impose any constraints on variable names
other than they be a NULL-terminated string.

The above commits caused a regression that resulted in users seeing
the following message,

  $ sudo mount -v /sys/firmware/efi/efivars mount: Cannot allocate memory

whenever pstore EFI variables were present in the variable store,
since their variable names failed to pass the following check,

    /* GUID should be right after the first '-' */
    if (s - 1 != strchr(str, '-'))

as a typical pstore filename is of the form, dump-type0-10-1-<guid>.
The fix is trivial since the guid portion of the filename is GUID_LEN
bytes, we can use (len - GUID_LEN) to ensure the '-' character is
where we expect it to be.

(The bogus ENOMEM error value will be fixed in a separate patch.)
