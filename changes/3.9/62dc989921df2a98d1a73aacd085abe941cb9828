kbuild: Fix missing '\n' for NEW symbols in yes "" | make oldconfig >conf.new

According to Documentation/kbuild/kconfig.txt, the commands:

    yes "" | make oldconfig >conf.new
    grep "(NEW)" conf.new

should list the new config symbols with their default values.
However, currently there is no line break after each new symbol.  When
kconfig is interactive the user will type a new-line at this point,
but when non-interactive kconfig must print it.
