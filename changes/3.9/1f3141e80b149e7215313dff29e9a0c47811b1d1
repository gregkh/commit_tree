KVM: VMX: remove special CPL cache access during transition to real mode.

Since vmx_get_cpl() always returns 0 when VCPU is in real mode it is no
longer needed. Also reset CPL cache to zero during transaction to
protected mode since transaction may happen while CS.selectors & 3 != 0,
but in reality CPL is 0.
