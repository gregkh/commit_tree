ARM: 7677/1: LPAE: Fix mapping in alloc_init_section for unaligned addresses

With LPAE enabled, alloc_init_section() does not map the entire
address space for unaligned addresses.

The issue also reproduced with CMA + LPAE. CMA tries to map 16MB
with page granularity mappings during boot. alloc_init_pte()
is called and out of 16MB, only 2MB gets mapped and rest remains
unaccessible.

Because of this OMAP5 boot is broken with CMA + LPAE enabled.
Fix the issue by ensuring that the entire addresses are
mapped.
