irq: Don't re-enable interrupts at the end of irq_exit

Commit 74eed0163d0def3fce27228d9ccf3d36e207b286
"irq: Ensure irq_exit() code runs with interrupts disabled"
restore interrupts flags in the end of irq_exit() for archs
that don't define __ARCH_IRQ_EXIT_IRQS_DISABLED.

However always returning from irq_exit() with interrupts
disabled should not be a problem for these archs. Prior to
this commit this was already happening anytime we processed
pending softirqs anyway.
