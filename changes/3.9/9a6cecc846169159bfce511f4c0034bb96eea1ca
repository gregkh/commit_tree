dmaengine: add helper function to request a slave DMA channel

Currently slave DMA channels are requested by calling dma_request_channel()
and requires DMA clients to pass various filter parameters to obtain the
appropriate channel.

With device-tree being used by architectures such as arm and the addition of
device-tree helper functions to extract the relevant DMA client information
from device-tree, add a new function to request a slave DMA channel using
device-tree. This function is currently a simple wrapper that calls the
device-tree of_dma_request_slave_channel() function.
