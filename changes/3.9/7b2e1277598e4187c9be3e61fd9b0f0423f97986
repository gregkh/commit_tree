ARM: OMAP3: clock: Back-propagate rate change from cam_mclk to dpll4_m5

The cam_mclk clock is generated through the following clocks chain:

dpll4 -> dpll4_m5 -> dpll4_m5x2 -> cam_mclk

As dpll4_m5 and dpll4_m5x2 do not driver any clock other than cam_mclk,
back-propagate the cam_clk rate changes up to dpll4_m5.
