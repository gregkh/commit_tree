KVM: s390: Add support for machine checks.

Add support for injecting machine checks (only repressible
conditions for now).

This is a bit more involved than I/O interrupts, for these reasons:

- Machine checks come in both floating and cpu varieties.
- We don't have a bit for machine checks enabling, but have to use
  a roundabout approach with trapping PSW changing instructions and
  watching for opened machine checks.
