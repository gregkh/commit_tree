drm/i915: don't disable the power well yet

We're still not 100% ready to disable the power well, so don't disable
it for now. When we disable it we break the audio driver (because some
of the audio registers are on the power well) and machines with eDP on
port D (because it doesn't use TRANSCODER_EDP).

Also, instead of just reverting the code, add a Kernel option to let
us disable it if we want. This will allow us to keep developing and
testing the feature while it's not enabled.

This fixes problems caused by the following commit:
