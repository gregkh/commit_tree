ceph: update support for PGID64, PGPOOL3, OSDENC protocol features

Support (and require) the PGID64, PGPOOL3, and OSDENC protocol features.
These have been present in ceph.git since v0.42, Feb 2012.  Require these
features to simplify support; nobody is running older userspace.

Note that the new request and reply encoding is still not in place, so the new
code is not yet functional.
