userns: Allow the userns root to mount ramfs.

There is no backing store to ramfs and file creation
rules are the same as for any other filesystem so
it is semantically safe to allow unprivileged users
to mount it.

The memory control group successfully limits how much
memory ramfs can consume on any system that cares about
a user namespace root using ramfs to exhaust memory
the memory control group can be deployed.
