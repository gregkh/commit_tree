[media] stk-webcam: Add an upside down dmi table, and add the Asus G1 to it

The stk-webcam module is inserted upside-down in some webcams, so we
need to de hflip and vflip by default on some models.
Note that this patch inverts the value of the controls as reported by
the control API in this case so that for the user they still make sense
(iow not doing any flipping from the ctrl API pov results in an upright
image).
