neigh: Keep neighbour cache entries if number of them is small enough.

Since we have removed NCE (Neighbour Cache Entry) reference from
routing entries, the only refcnt holders of an NCE are its timer
(if running) and its owner table, in usual cases.  As a result,
neigh_periodic_work() purges NCEs over and over again even for
gateways.

It does not make sense to purge entries, if number of them is
very small, so keep them.  The minimum number of entries to keep
is specified by gc_thresh1.
