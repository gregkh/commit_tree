fs: Readd the fs module aliases.

I had assumed that the only use of module aliases for filesystems
prior to "fs: Limit sys_mount to only request filesystem modules."
was in request_module.  It turns out I was wrong.  At least mkinitcpio
in Arch linux uses these aliases.

So readd the preexising aliases, to keep from breaking userspace.

Userspace eventually will have to follow and use the same aliases the
kernel does.  So at some point we may be delete these aliases without
problems.  However that day is not today.
