mfd: twl4030-madc: Remove __exit_p annotation

4740f73fe5 "mfd: remove use of __devexit" removed the __devexit annotation
on the twl4030_madc_remove function, but left an __exit_p() present on the
pointer to this function. Using __exit_p was as wrong with the devexit in
place as it is now, but now we get a gcc warning about an unused function.

In order for the twl4030_madc_remove to work correctly in built-in code, we
have to remove the __exit_p.
