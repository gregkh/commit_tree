PM / tracing: remove deprecated power trace API

The text in Documentation said it would be removed in 2.6.41;
the text in the Kconfig said removal in the 3.1 release.  Either
way you look at it, we are well past both, so push it off a cliff.

Note that the POWER_CSTATE and the POWER_PSTATE are part of the
legacy tracing API.  Remove all tracepoints which use these flags.
As can be seen from context, most already have a trace entry via
trace_cpu_idle anyways.

Also, the cpufreq/cpufreq.c PSTATE one is actually unpaired, as
compared to the CSTATE ones which all have a clear start/stop.
As part of this, the trace_power_frequency also becomes orphaned,
so it too is deleted.
