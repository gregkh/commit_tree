f2fs: fix calculation of max. gc cost in the SSR case

In the SSR case, the max gc cost should be the number of pages in a segment.
Otherwise, f2fs is able to fail getting dirty segments frequently for SSR.

In get_victim_by_default() previously,

while(1) {
   ...
   cost = get_gc_cost(); <- cost is between 0 ~ 512.
   ...
   if (cost == get_max_cost(sbi, &p)) <- max cost is UINT_MAX due to GC_CB type
	continue;

   if (nsearched++ >= MAX_VICTIM_SEARCH)
	break;
}

So, if there are a number of fully valid segments in series, f2fs cannot skip
those segments by comparing the cost and max cost of each segment.

Note that, the cost is the number of valid blocks at the time of the last
checkpoint.
