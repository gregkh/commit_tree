drm/i915: Initialize hardware semaphore state on ring init

Hardware status page needs to have proper seqno set
as our initial seqno can be arbitrary. If initial seqno is close
to wrap boundary on init and i915_seqno_passed() (31bit space)
refers to hw status page which contains zero, errorneous result
will be returned.

v2: clear mboxes and set hws page directly instead of going
through rings. Suggested by Chris Wilson.

v3: hws needs to be updated for all gens. Noticed by Chris
Wilson.
