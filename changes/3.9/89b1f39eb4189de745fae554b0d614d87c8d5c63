udf: Fix bitmap overflow on large filesystems with small block size

For large UDF filesystems with 512-byte blocks the number of necessary
bitmap blocks is larger than 2^16 so s_nr_groups in udf_bitmap overflows
(the number will overflow for filesystems larger than 128 GB with
512-byte blocks). That results in ENOSPC errors despite the filesystem
has plenty of free space.

Fix the problem by changing s_nr_groups' type to 'int'. That is enough
even for filesystems 2^32 blocks (UDF maximum) and 512-byte blocksize.
