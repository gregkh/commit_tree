[media] [REGRESSION] bt8xx: Fix too large height in cropcap

Since commit a1fd287780c8e91fed4957b30c757b0c93021162:
"[media] bttv-driver: fix two warnings"
cropcap.defrect.height and cropcap.bounds.height for the PAL entry are 32
resp 30 pixels too large, if a userspace app (ie xawtv) actually tries to use
the full advertised height, the resulting image is broken in ways only a
screenshot can describe.
The cause of this is the fix for this warning:
drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/bttv-driver.c:308:3: warning: initialized field overwritten [-Woverride-init]

                .name           = "NTSC",
Which replaces the overriding of cropcap.bounds.height initialization outside
of the CROPCAP macro (which also initializes it), with passing a
different sheight value to the CROPCAP macro.
There are 2 problems with this warning fix:
1) The sheight value is used twice in the CROPCAP macro, and the old code
   only changed one resulting value.
2) The old code increased the .cropcap.bounds.height value (and did not
   touch the .cropcap.defrect.height value at all) by 2, where as the fixed
   code increases it by 32, as the fixed code passes (576 + 2) + 0x20 - 2
   to the CROPCAP macro, but the + 0x20 - 2 is already done by the macro so
   now is done twice for .cropcap.bounds.height, and also is applied to
   .cropcap.defrect.height where it should not be applied at all.
This patch fixes this by adding an extraheight parameter to the CROPCAP entry
and using it for the PAL entry.
