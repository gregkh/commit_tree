drm/i915: Only run idle processing from i915_gem_retire_requests_worker

When adding the fb idle detection to mark-inactive, it was forgotten
that userspace can drive the processing of retire-requests. We assumed
that it would be principally driven by the retire requests worker,
running once every second whilst active and so we would get the deferred
timer for free. Instead we spend too many CPU cycles reclocking the LVDS
preventing real work from being done.
