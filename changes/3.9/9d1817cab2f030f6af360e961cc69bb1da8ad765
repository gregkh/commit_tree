Good job. I was too lazy to bisect for bad commit;)

Reading the code I found problematic kthread_should_stop call from netlink
connector which causes the oops. After applying a patch, I've been testing
owfs+w1 setup for nearly two days and it seems to work very reliable (no
hangs, no memleaks etc).
More detailed description and possible fix is given below:

Function w1_search can be called from either kthread or netlink callback.
While the former works fine, the latter causes oops due to kthread_should_stop
invocation.

This patch adds a check if w1_search is serving netlink command, skipping
kthread_should_stop invocation if so.
