ring-buffer: Remove trace.h from ring_buffer.c

ring_buffer.c use to require declarations from trace.h, but
these have moved to the generic header files. There's nothing
in trace.h that ring_buffer.c requires.

There's some headers that trace.h included that ring_buffer.c
needs, but it's best that it includes them directly, and not
include trace.h.

Also, some things may use ring_buffer.c without having tracing
configured. This removes the dependency that may come in the
future.
