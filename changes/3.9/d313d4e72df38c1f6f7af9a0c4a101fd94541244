parisc: remove unused compat_rt_sigframe.h header

Nothing uses compat_rt_sigframe.h anymore. Commit
f671c45df23005692daa200aba768c642fb14ef2 ("[PARISC] Arch-specific compat
signals") removed all includes of that header. It also basically copied
that entire header verbatim into signal32.h. It seems it was just
forgotten to also remove compat_rt_sigframe.h from the tree. Remove that
header now.
