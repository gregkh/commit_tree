powerpc: Add book3s privileged doorbell exception vectors

Directed Privileged Doorbell Interrupts come in at 0xa00 (or
0xc000000000004a00 if relocation on exception is enabled), so add
exception vectors at these locations.

If doorbell support is not compiled in we handle it as an
unknown_exception.
