mac80211: fix auth/assoc timeout handling

In my commit 1672c0e31917f49d31d30d79067103432bc20cc7
("mac80211: start auth/assoc timeout on frame status")
I broke auth/assoc timeout handling: in case we wait
for the TX status, it now leaves the timeout field set
to 0, which is a valid time and can compare as being
before now ("jiffies"). Thus, if the work struct runs
for some other reason, the auth/assoc is treated as
having timed out.

Fix this by introducing a separate "timeout_started"
variable that tracks whether the timeout has started
and is checked before timing out.

Additionally, for proper TX status handling the change
requires that the skb->dev pointer is set up for all
the frames, so set it up for all frames in mac80211.
