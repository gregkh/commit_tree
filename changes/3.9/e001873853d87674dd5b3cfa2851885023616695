xfs: ensure we capture IO errors correctly

Failed buffer readahead can leave the buffer in the cache marked
with an error. Most callers that then issue a subsequent read on the
buffer do not zero the b_error field out, and so we may incorectly
detect an error during IO completion due to the stale error value
left on the buffer.

Avoid this problem by zeroing the error before IO submission. This
ensures that the only IO errors that are detected those captured
from are those captured from bio submission or completion.
