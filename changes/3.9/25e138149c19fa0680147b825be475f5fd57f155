powerpc: Apply early paca fixups to boot_paca and the boot cpu's paca

In commit 466921c we added a hack to set the paca data_offset to zero so
that per-cpu accesses would work on the boot cpu prior to per-cpu areas
being setup. This fixed a problem with lockdep touching per-cpu areas
very early in boot.

However if we combine CONFIG_LOCK_STAT=y with any of the PPC_EARLY_DEBUG
options, we can hit the same problem in udbg_early_init(). To avoid that
we need to set the data_offset of the boot_paca also. So factor out the
fixup logic and call it for both the boot_paca, and "the paca of the
boot cpu".
