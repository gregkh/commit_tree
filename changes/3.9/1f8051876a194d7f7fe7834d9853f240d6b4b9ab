virtio_console: Let unconnected rproc device receive data.

Allow rproc serial ports to receive data before the port
is connected.

Rproc serial ports usually talk to very simple remote devices
with no control queue managing open/close events. So we must
let remote devices write to the virtio ring even if the device
is not yet fully initialized.
