cifs: Check server capability before attempting silly rename

cifs_rename_pending_delete() attempts to silly rename file using
CIFSSMBRenameOpenFile(). This uses the SET_FILE_INFORMATION TRANS2
command with information level set to the passthru info-level
SMB_SET_FILE_RENAME_INFORMATION.

We need to check to make sure that the server support passthru
info-levels before attempting the silly rename or else we will fail to
rename the file.
