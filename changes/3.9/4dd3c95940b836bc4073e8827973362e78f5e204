asm-generic/unistd.h: handle symbol prefixes in cond_syscall

Some architectures have symbol prefixes and set CONFIG_SYMBOL_PREFIX,
but this wasn't taken into account by the generic cond_syscall. It's
easy enough to fix in a generic fashion, so add the symbol prefix to
symbol names in cond_syscall when CONFIG_SYMBOL_PREFIX is set.
