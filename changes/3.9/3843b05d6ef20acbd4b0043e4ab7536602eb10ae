perf symbols: Ignore ABS symbols when loading data maps

When loading symbols in a data mapping, ABS symbols (which has a value
of SHN_ABS in its st_shndx) failed at elf_getscn().  And it marks the
loading as a failure so already loaded symbols cannot be fixed up.

I'm not sure what should be done. Just ignore them for now. :)
