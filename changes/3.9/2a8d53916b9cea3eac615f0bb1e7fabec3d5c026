ALSA: hda - Fix the wrong adc_idx for capture source

The patch "ALSA: hda - fix wrong adc_idx in generic parser" fixed the
adc_idx for the capture volume and capture switch controls.  But also
modified the adc_idx retrieval for the capture source controls
wrongly.  As multiple capture source controls are created in a single
shot with counts > 1, the id.index doesn't contain the real value.
The real index has to be taken via snd_ctl_get_ioffidx() as in the
original code.

This patch reverts the fixes partially to recover from the
regression.
