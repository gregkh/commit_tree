ACPI: Remove acpi_start_single_object() and acpi_bus_start()

The ACPI PCI root bridge driver was the only ACPI driver implementing
the .start() callback, which isn't used by any ACPI drivers any more
now.

For this reason, acpi_start_single_object() has no purpose any more,
so remove it and all references to it.  Also remove
acpi_bus_start_device(), whose only purpose was to call
acpi_start_single_object().

Moreover, since after the removal of acpi_bus_start_device() the
only purpose of acpi_bus_start() remains to call
acpi_update_all_gpes(), move that into acpi_bus_add() and drop
acpi_bus_start() too, remove its header from acpi_bus.h and
update all of its former users accordingly.

This change was previously proposed in a different from by
Yinghai Lu.
