ALSA: hda - Increase badness for missing multi-io

The current badness value used for the missing multi-io seems too
weak, and the multi-io tends to be skipped for desktop configurations
when no enough DACs are available.  It's because the total badness of
the multi-io becomes often larger than the badness with assigning an
individual DAC to a headphone jack.  This is good for one side, but it
seems that the surround outputs are more demanded by that.

This patch increases the badness value for the missing multi-io
slightly so that the multi-io would be preferred than the individual
headphone DAC if they conflict.  Through the tests with hda-emu,
mostly only desktop configurations with ALC662/663 and CMI codecs are
affected by this change, and all look reasonable.
