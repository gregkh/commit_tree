tty: Added a CONFIG_TTY option to allow removal of TTY

The option allows you to remove TTY and compile without errors. This
saves space on systems that won't support TTY interfaces anyway.
bloat-o-meter output is below.

The bulk of this patch consists of Kconfig changes adding "depends on
TTY" to various serial devices and similar drivers that require the TTY
layer.  Ideally, these dependencies would occur on a common intermediate
symbol such as SERIO, but most drivers "select SERIO" rather than
"depends on SERIO", and "select" does not respect dependencies.

bloat-o-meter output comparing our previous minimal to new minimal by
removing TTY.  The list is filtered to not show removed entries with awk
'$3 != "-"' as the list was very long.
