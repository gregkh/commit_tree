workqueue: fix is_chained_work() regression

c9e7cf273f ("workqueue: move busy_hash from global_cwq to
worker_pool") incorrectly converted is_chained_work() to use
get_gcwq() inside for_each_gcwq_cpu() while removing get_gcwq().

As cwq might not exist for all possible workqueue CPUs, @cwq can be
NULL and the following cwq deferences can lead to oops.

Fix it by using for_each_cwq_cpu() instead, which is the better one to
use anyway as we only need to check pools that the wq is associated
with.
