ipv4: Disallow non-namespace aware protocols to register.

All in-tree ipv4 protocol implementations are now namespace
aware.  Therefore all the run-time checks are superfluous.

Reject registry of any non-namespace aware ipv4 protocol.
Eventually we'll remove prot->netns_ok and this registry
time check as well.
