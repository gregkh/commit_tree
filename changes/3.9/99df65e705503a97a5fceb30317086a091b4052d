Input: ALPS - copy "model" info into alps_data struct

Not every type of ALPS touchpad is well-suited to table-based detection.
Start moving the various alps_model_data attributes into the alps_data
struct so that we don't need a unique table entry for every possible
permutation of protocol version, flags, byte0/mask0, etc.
