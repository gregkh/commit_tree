workqueue: use std_ prefix for the standard per-cpu pools

There are currently two worker pools per cpu (including the unbound
cpu) and they are the only pools in use.  New class of pools are
scheduled to be added and some pool related APIs will be added
inbetween.  Call the existing pools the standard pools and prefix them
with std_.  Do this early so that new APIs can use std_ prefix from
the beginning.

This patch doesn't introduce any functional difference.
