ixgbe: add missing supported filters to get_ts_info

This patch updates the filters for ethtool's get_ts_info to return support for
all filters which can be supported by upscaling to ptp_v2_event. The intent
behind this change is due to reasoning that we do in fact support the
filters. (hwtstamp_ioctl returns success after setting the filter to the
upscaled version). In this way we can remain consistent over which filters are
supported via the get_ts_info ioctl and which filters are in practice actually
supported.
