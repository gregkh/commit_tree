netpoll: cleanup sparse warnings

With my recent commit I introduced two sparse warnings.  Looking closer there
were a few more in the same file, so I fixed them all up.  Basic rcu pointer
dereferencing suff.

I've validated these changes using CONFIG_PROVE_RCU while starting and stopping
netconsole repeatedly in bonded and non-bonded configurations
