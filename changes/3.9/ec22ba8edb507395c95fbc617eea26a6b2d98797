ext4: disable merging of uninitialized extents

Derived from Jan's patch:http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.file-systems.ext4/36470

Merging of uninitialized extents creates all sorts of interesting race
possibilities when writeback / DIO races with fallocate. Thus
ext4_convert_unwritten_extents_endio() has to deal with a case where
extent to be converted needs to be split out first. That isn't nice
for two reasons:

1) It may need allocation of extent tree block so ENOSPC is possible.
2) It complicates end_io handling code

So we disable merging of uninitialized extents which allows us to simplify
the code. Extents will get merged after they are converted to initialized
ones.
