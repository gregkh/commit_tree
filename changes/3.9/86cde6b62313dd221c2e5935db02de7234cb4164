blkcg: reorganize blkg_lookup_create() and friends

Reorganize such that

* __blkg_lookup() takes bool param @update_hint to determine whether
  to update hint.

* __blkg_lookup_create() no longer performs lookup before trying to
  create.  Renamed to blkg_create().

* blkg_lookup_create() now performs lookup and then invokes
  blkg_create() if lookup fails.

* root_blkg creation in blkcg_activate_policy() updated accordingly.
  Note that blkcg_activate_policy() no longer updates lookup hint if
  root_blkg already exists.

Except for the last lookup hint bit which is immaterial, this is pure
reorganization and doesn't introduce any visible behavior change.
This is to prepare for proper hierarchy support.
