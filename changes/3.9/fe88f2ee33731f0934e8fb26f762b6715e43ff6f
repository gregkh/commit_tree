kexec: prevent double free on image allocation failure

If kimage_normal_alloc() fails to initialize an allocated kimage, it will
free the image but would still set 'rimage', as a result kexec_load will
try to free it again.

This would explode as part of the freeing process is accessing internal
members which point to uninitialized memory.
