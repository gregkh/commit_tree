mm: rename page struct field helpers

The function names page_xchg_last_nid(), page_last_nid() and
reset_page_last_nid() were judged to be inconsistent so rename them to a
struct_field_op style pattern.  As it looked jarring to have
reset_page_mapcount() and page_nid_reset_last() beside each other in
memmap_init_zone(), this patch also renames reset_page_mapcount() to
page_mapcount_reset().  There are others like init_page_count() but as
it is used throughout the arch code a rename would likely cause more
conflicts than it is worth.
