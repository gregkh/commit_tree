[media] uvcvideo: Fix race of open and suspend in error case

Ming Lei reported:
IMO, there is a minor fault in the error handling path of
uvc_status_start() inside uvc_v4l2_open(), and the 'users' count should
have been decreased before usb_autopm_put_interface(). In theory, a [URB
resubmission] warning can be triggered when the device is opened just
between usb_autopm_put_interface() and atomic_dec(&stream->dev->users).
The fix is trivial.
