arm: arch_timer: factor out register accessors

Currently the arch_timer register accessors are thrown together with
the main driver, preventing us from porting the driver to other
architectures.

This patch moves the register accessors into a header file, as with
the arm64 version. Constants required by the accessors are also moved.
