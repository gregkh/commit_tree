pch_uart: fix a deadlock when pch_uart as console

When we use pch_uart as system console like 'console=ttyPCH0,115200',
then 'send break' to it. We'll encounter the deadlock on a cpu/core,
with interrupts disabled on the core. When we happen to have all irqs
affinity to cpu0 then the deadlock on cpu0 actually deadlock whole
system.

In pch_uart_interrupt, we have spin_lock_irqsave(&priv->lock, flags)
then call pch_uart_err_ir when break is received. Then the call to
dev_err would actually call to pch_console_write then we'll run into
another spin_lock(&priv->lock), with interrupts disabled.

So in the call sequence lead by pch_uart_interrupt, we should be
carefully to call functions that will 'print message to console' only
in case the uart port is not being used as serial console.
