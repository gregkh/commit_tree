spi/pxa2xx: break out the private DMA API usage into a separate file

The PXA SPI driver uses PXA platform specific private DMA implementation
which does not work on non-PXA platforms. In order to use this driver on
other platforms we break out the private DMA implementation into a separate
file that gets compiled only when CONFIG_SPI_PXA2XX_PXADMA is set. The DMA
functions are stubbed out if there is no DMA implementation selected (i.e
we are building on non-PXA platform).

While we are there we can kill the dummy DMA bits in pxa2xx_spi.h as they
are not needed anymore for CE4100.

Once this is done we can add the generic DMA engine support to the driver
that allows usage of any DMA controller that implements DMA engine API.
