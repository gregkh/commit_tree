openrisc: really pass correct arg to schedule_tail

Commit 287ad220cd8b5a9d29f71c78f6e4051093f051fc tried to set up the argument
to schedule_tail, but ended up using TI_STACK which isn't a defined symbol.
Sadly, the old openrisc compiler silently ignores this fact and it was first
discovered now when building with an updated toolchain.
