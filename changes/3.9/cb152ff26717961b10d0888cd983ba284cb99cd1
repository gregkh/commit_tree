sched: Fix /proc/sched_stat failure on very very large systems

On systems with 4096 cores doing a cat /proc/sched_stat fails,
because we are trying to push all the data into a single kmalloc
buffer.

The issue is on these very large machines all the data will not
fit in 4mb.

A better solution is to not use the single_open() mechanism but
to provide our own seq_operations.

The output should be identical to previous version and thus not
need the version number.
