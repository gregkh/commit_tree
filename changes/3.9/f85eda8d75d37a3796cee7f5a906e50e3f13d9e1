target: Fix RESERVATION_CONFLICT status regression for iscsi-target special case

This patch fixes a regression introduced in v3.8-rc1 code where a failed
target_check_reservation() check in target_setup_cmd_from_cdb() was causing
an incorrect SAM_STAT_GOOD status to be returned during a WRITE operation
performed by an unregistered / unreserved iscsi initiator port.

This regression is only effecting iscsi-target due to a special case check
for TCM_RESERVATION_CONFLICT within iscsi_target_erl1.c:iscsit_execute_cmd(),
and was still correctly disallowing WRITE commands from backend submission
for unregistered / unreserved initiator ports, while returning the incorrect
SAM_STAT_GOOD status due to the missing SAM_STAT_RESERVATION_CONFLICT
assignment.

This regression was first introduced with:

    target: pass sense_reason as a return value

Go ahead and re-add the missing SAM_STAT_RESERVATION_CONFLICT assignment
during a target_check_reservation() failure, so that iscsi-target code
sends the correct SCSI status.

All other fabrics using target_submit_cmd_*() with a RESERVATION_CONFLICT
call to transport_generic_request_failure() are not effected by this bug.
