ALSA: hda - Correct more array rooms in hda_gen_spec

Looking through the whole definitions, some fields have inappropriate
array sizes, especially about the capture.  The array assigned to each
input (pin) should have HDA_MAX_NUM_INPUTS entries while the array
assigned to each ADC should have AUTO_CFG_MAX_INS entries.
