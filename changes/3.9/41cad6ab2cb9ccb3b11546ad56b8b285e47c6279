cfq-iosched: convert cfq_group_slice() to use cfqg->vfraction

cfq_group_slice() calculates slice by taking a fraction of
cfq_target_latency according to the ratio of cfqg->weight against
service_tree->total_weight.  This currently works only because all
cfqgs are treated to be at the same level.

To prepare for proper hierarchy support, convert cfq_group_slice() to
base the calculation on cfqg->vfraction.  As cfqg->vfraction is always
a fraction of 1 and represents the fraction allocated to the cfqg with
hierarchy considered, the slice can be simply calculated by
multiplying cfqg->vfraction to cfq_target_latency (with fixed point
shift factored in).

As vfraction calculation currently treats all non-root cfqgs as
children of the root cfqg, this patch doesn't introduce noticeable
behavior difference.
