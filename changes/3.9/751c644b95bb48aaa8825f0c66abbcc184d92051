pid: Handle the exit of a multi-threaded init.

When a multi-threaded init exits and the initial thread is not the
last thread to exit the initial thread hangs around as a zombie
until the last thread exits.  In that case zap_pid_ns_processes
needs to wait until there are only 2 hashed pids in the pid
namespace not one.

v2. Replace thread_pid_vnr(me) == 1 with the test thread_group_leader(me)
    as suggested by Oleg.
