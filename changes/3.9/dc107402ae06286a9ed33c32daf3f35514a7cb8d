SUNRPC: make AF_LOCAL connect synchronous

It doesn't appear that anyone actually needs to connect asynchronously.

Also, using a workqueue for the connect means we lose the namespace
information from the original process.  This is a problem since there's
no way to explicitly pass in a filesystem namespace for resolution of an
AF_LOCAL address.
