ARM: OMAP4: hwmod data: Update AESS data with memory bank area

Add AESS memory bank data in hwmod in order to provide memory address
information to the driver.

This version also changes the AESS main clock to use a
non-CLKCTRL-based functional clock.  These are being removed from the
clock data, since they should be handled by the IP block integration
code.  Without this change, the kernel crashes during boot.  Thanks to
Tony Lindgren for reporting this during a test merge.
