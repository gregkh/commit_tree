ext4: don't allow quota mount options when quota feature enabled

So far we silently ignored when quota mount options were set while quota
feature was enabled.  But this can create confusion in userspace when
mount options are set but silently ignored and also creates opportunities
for bugs when we don't properly test all quota types.  Actually
ext4_mark_dquot_dirty() forgets to test for quota feature so it was
dependent on journaled quota options being set.  OTOH ext4_orphan_cleanup()
tries to enable journaled quota when quota options are specified which is
wrong when quota feature is enabled.
