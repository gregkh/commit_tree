nl80211/cfg80211: add radar detection command/event

Add new NL80211_CMD_RADAR_DETECT, which starts the Channel
Availability Check (CAC). This command will also notify the
usermode about events (CAC finished, CAC aborted, radar
detected, NOP finished).
Once radar detection has started it should continuously
monitor for radars as long as the channel is active.

This patch enables DFS for AP mode in nl80211/cfg80211.
