ARM: imx: return zero in case next event gets a large increment

The return of v2_set_next_event() will lead to an infinite loop in
tick_handle_oneshot_broadcast() - "goto again;" with imx6q WAIT mode
(to be enabled).  This happens because when global event did not expire
any CPU local events, the broadcast device will be rearmed to a CPU
local next_event, which could be far away from now and result in a
max_delta_tick programming in set_next_event().

Fix the problem by detecting those next events with increments larger
than 0x7fffffff, and simply return zero in that case.

It leaves mx1_2_set_next_event() unchanged since only v2_set_next_event()
will be running with imx6q WAIT mode support.

Thanks Russell King for helping understand the problem.
