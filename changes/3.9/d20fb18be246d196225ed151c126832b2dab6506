crypto: omap-sham - Add SHA224 and SHA256 Support

The OMAP4/AM33xx version of the SHAM crypto module
supports SHA224 and SHA256 in addition to MD5 and
SHA1 that the OMAP2 version of the module supports.

To add this support, use the platform_data introduced
in an ealier commit to hold the list of algorithms
supported by the current module.  The probe routine
will use that list to register the correct algorithms.

Note: The code being integrated is from the TI AM33xx SDK
and was written by Greg Turner <gkmturner@gmail.com> and
Herman Schuurman (current email unknown) while at TI.
