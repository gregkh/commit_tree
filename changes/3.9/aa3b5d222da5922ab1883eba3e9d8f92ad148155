Thermal: kirkwood: Convert to devm_ioremap_resource()

Use the newly introduced devm_ioremap_resource() instead of
devm_request_and_ioremap() which provides more consistent error handling.

devm_ioremap_resource() provides its own error messages; so all explicit
error messages can be removed from the failure code paths.
