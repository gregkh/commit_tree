ALSA: hda - Add input jack mode enum controls to generic parser

Just like the jack mode enum ctls for output jacks, add the support
for similar enum ctls for input pins to control the bias Vref.
The new controls will be added when spec->add_in_jack_modes is set
either by the codec driver or by a hint string.

Note that ground and 100% vrefs are excluded from the list for
simplicity, currently.  We may add a new flag to allow them, too.
But I guess it's easier to put a value override in the pinfix in such
a case.
