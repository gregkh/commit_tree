dmaengine: dw_dmac: move to generic DMA binding

The original device tree binding for this driver, from Viresh Kumar
unfortunately conflicted with the generic DMA binding, and did not allow
to completely seperate slave device configuration from the controller.

This is an attempt to replace it with an implementation of the generic
binding, but it is currently completely untested, because I do not have
any hardware with this particular controller.

The patch applies on top of the slave-dma tree, which contains both the base
support for the generic DMA binding, as well as the earlier attempt from
Viresh. Both of these are currently not merged upstream however.

This version incorporates feedback from Viresh Kumar, Andy Shevchenko
and Russell King.
