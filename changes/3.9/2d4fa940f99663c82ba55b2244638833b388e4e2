USB: Prepare for refactoring by adding extra udev checks.

The next patch will refactor the hub port code to rip out the recursive
call to hub_port_reset on a failed hot reset.  In preparation for that,
make sure all code paths can deal with being called with a NULL udev.
The usb_device will not be valid if warm reset was issued because a port
transitioned to the Inactive or Compliance Mode on a device connect.

This patch should have no effect on current behavior.
