memcg: replace cgroup_lock with memcg specific memcg_lock

After the preparation work done in earlier patches, the cgroup_lock can
be trivially replaced with a memcg-specific lock.  This is an automatic
translation at every site where the values involved were queried.

The sites where values are written, however, used to be naturally called
under cgroup_lock.  This is the case for instance in the css_online
callback.  For those, we now need to explicitly add the memcg lock.

With this, all the calls to cgroup_lock outside cgroup core are gone.
