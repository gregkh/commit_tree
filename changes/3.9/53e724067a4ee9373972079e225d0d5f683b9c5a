ARM: KVM: arch_timers: Add guest timer core support

Add some the architected timer related infrastructure, and support timer
interrupt injection, which can happen as a resultof three possible
events:

- The virtual timer interrupt has fired while we were still
  executing the guest
- The timer interrupt hasn't fired, but it expired while we
  were doing the world switch
- A hrtimer we programmed earlier has fired
