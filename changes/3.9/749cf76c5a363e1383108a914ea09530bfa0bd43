KVM: ARM: Initial skeleton to compile KVM support

Targets KVM support for Cortex A-15 processors.

Contains all the framework components, make files, header files, some
tracing functionality, and basic user space API.

Only supported core is Cortex-A15 for now.

Most functionality is in arch/arm/kvm/* or arch/arm/include/asm/kvm_*.h.
