ARM: OMAP4: clock/hwmod data: start to remove some IP block control "clocks"

Remove some leaf "clocks" that are actually IP block idle control
points, since these should now be handled by the hwmod code.

There are still a few types of MODULEMODE clocks that need to be
cleaned up:

- those still in use by driver or integration code

- those in DEFINE_CLK_OMAP_MUX_GATE() blocks; the gate portion of
  these should be removed

A similar process may also be possible on OMAP2/3.
