ipv6: don't accept node local multicast traffic from the wire

Erik Hugne's errata proposal (Errata ID: 3480) to RFC4291 has been
verified: http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?eid=3480

We have to check for pkt_type and loopback flag because either the
packets are allowed to travel over the loopback interface (in which case
pkt_type is PACKET_HOST and IFF_LOOPBACK flag is set) or they travel
over a non-loopback interface back to us (in which case PACKET_TYPE is
PACKET_LOOPBACK and IFF_LOOPBACK flag is not set).
