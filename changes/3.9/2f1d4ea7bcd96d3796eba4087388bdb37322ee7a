powerpc/pseries: Allow firmware features to match partial strings

This allows firmware_features_table names to add a '*' at the end so that only
partial strings are matched.

When a '*' is added, only upto the '*' is matched when setting firmware feature
bits.

This is useful for the matching best energy feature.
