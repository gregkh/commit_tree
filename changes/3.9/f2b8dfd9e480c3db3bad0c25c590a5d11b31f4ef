serial: 8250: Keep 8250.<xxxx> module options functional after driver rename

With commit 835d844d1 (8250_pnp: do pnp probe before legacy probe), the
8250 driver was renamed to 8250_core.  This means any existing usage of
the 8259.<xxxx> module parameters or as a kernel command line switch is
now broken, as the 8250_core driver doesn't parse options belonging to
something called "8250".

To solve this, we redefine the module options in a dummy function using
a redefined MODULE_PARAM_PREFX when built into the kernel.  In the case
where we're building as a module, we provide an alias to the old 8250
name.  The dummy function prevents compiler errors due to global variable
redefinitions that happen as part of the module_param_ macro expansions.
