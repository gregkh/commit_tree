x86/mce: don't use [delayed_]work_pending()

There's no need to test whether a (delayed) work item in pending
before queueing, flushing or cancelling it.  Most uses are unnecessary
and quite a few of them are buggy.

Remove unnecessary pending tests from x86/mce.  Only compile tested.

v2: Local var work removed from mce_schedule_work() as suggested by
    Borislav.
