dm: add cache target

Add a target that allows a fast device such as an SSD to be used as a
cache for a slower device such as a disk.

A plug-in architecture was chosen so that the decisions about which data
to migrate and when are delegated to interchangeable tunable policy
modules.  The first general purpose module we have developed, called
"mq" (multiqueue), follows in the next patch.  Other modules are
under development.
