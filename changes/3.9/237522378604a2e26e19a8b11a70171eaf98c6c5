perf gtk/annotate: Show source lines with gray color

In order to differentiate source lines from asm line, print them with
gray color.  To do this, it needs to be escaped since sometimes it
contains "<" and/or ">" characters so that it should not be considered
as a markup tags.  Use glib's g_markup_escape_text() for this.
