drm/i915: Introduce i915_gem_object_create_stolen()

Allow for the creation of GEM objects backed by stolen memory. As these
are not backed by ordinary pages, we create a fake dma mapping and store
the address in the scatterlist rather than obj->pages.

v2: Mark _i915_gem_object_create_stolen() as static, as noticed by Jesse
Barnes.
