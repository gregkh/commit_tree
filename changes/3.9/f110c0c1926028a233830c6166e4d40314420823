powerpc: fix compiling CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM when CONFIG_ALTIVEC=n

We can't compile a kernel with CONFIG_ALTIVEC=n when
CONFIG_PPC_TRANSACTIONAL_MEM=y.  We currently get:

arch/powerpc/kernel/tm.S:320: Error: unsupported relocation against THREAD_VSCR
arch/powerpc/kernel/tm.S:323: Error: unsupported relocation against THREAD_VR0
arch/powerpc/kernel/tm.S:323: Error: unsupported relocation against THREAD_VR0
etc.

The below fixes this with a sprinkling of #ifdefs.
