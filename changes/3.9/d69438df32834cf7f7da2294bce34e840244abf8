Staging: bcm: Remove typedef for IPV6DestOptionsHeaderFormatTag and call directly.

This patch removes typedef IPV6DestOptionsHeaderFormatTag,
and changes the name of the struct to bcm_ipv6_dest_options_hdr.
In addition, any calls to typedef IPV6DestOptionsHeader
are changed to call the struct directly.
