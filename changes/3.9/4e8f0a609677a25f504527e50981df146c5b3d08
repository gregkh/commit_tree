workqueue: remove worker_pool->gcwq

The only remaining user of pool->gcwq is std_worker_pool_pri().
Reimplement it using get_gcwq() and remove worker_pool->gcwq.

This is part of an effort to remove global_cwq and make worker_pool
the top level abstraction, which in turn will help implementing worker
pools with user-specified attributes.
