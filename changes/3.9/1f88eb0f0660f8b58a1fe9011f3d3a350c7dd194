ASoC: soc-compress: Add support for not memory mapped DSPs

The ASoC compressed API did not implement the copy callback in its
compressed ops which is required for DSPs that are not memory mapped.

This patch creates a local copy of the compress ops for each runtime and
modifies them with a copy callback as appropriate.
