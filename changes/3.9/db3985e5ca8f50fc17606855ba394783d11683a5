Revert "drm: Add EDID_QUIRK_FORCE_REDUCED_BLANKING for ASUS VW222S"

This reverts commit 6f33814bd4d9cfe76033a31b1c0c76c960cd8e4b.

The quirk cause a regression, and it looks like the original bug was
simply a lack of FIFO bandwidth on the i915G of the reporter. Which
should eventually be fixed as soon as we get around to implemented
DSPARB FIFO reassignment on gen 3.
