pinctrl: tegra114: add pinctrl driver for NVIDIA's Tegra114 SoC

This adds a driver for the Tegra114 pinmux, and required
parameterization data for Tegra114.

The driver uses the common Tegra pincontrol driver utility
functions to implement the majority of the driver.

This driver is not compatible with the earlier NVIDIA's SoCs,
hence add new compatibile as "nvidia,tegra114-pinmux".

	- cleanup the patches,
	- remove non-require tables.
	- Use module_platform_driver() for driver registartion.
