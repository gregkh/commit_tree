mempolicy: fix is_valid_nodemask()

is_valid_nodemask() was introduced by commit 19770b32609b ("mm: filter
based on a nodemask as well as a gfp_mask").  but it does not match its
comments, because it does not check the zone which > policy_zone.

Also in commit b377fd3982ad ("Apply memory policies to top two highest
zones when highest zone is ZONE_MOVABLE"), this commits told us, if
highest zone is ZONE_MOVABLE, we should also apply memory policies to
it.  so ZONE_MOVABLE should be valid zone for policies.
is_valid_nodemask() need to be changed to match it.

Fix: check all zones, even its zoneid > policy_zone.  Use
nodes_intersects() instead open code to check it.
