drm/i915: move set_pll_edp to intel_dp.c

Now that we enable the cpu edp pll in intel_dp->pre_enable and no
longer in crtc_mode_set, we can also move the modeset part to the
intel_dp->mode_set callback. Previously this was not possible because
the encoder ->mode_set callbacks are called after the crtc mode set
callback.

v2: Rebase on top of copy&pasted hsw crtc_mode_set.
