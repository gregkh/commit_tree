Driver core: treat unregistered bus_types as having no devices

A bus_type has a list of devices (klist_devices), but the list and the
subsys_private structure that contains it are not initialized until the
bus_type is registered with bus_register().

The panic/reboot path has fixups that look up devices in pci_bus_type.  If
we panic before registering pci_bus_type, the bus_type exists but the list
does not, so mach_reboot_fixups() trips over a null pointer and panics
again:

    mach_reboot_fixups
      pci_get_device
        ..
          bus_find_device(&pci_bus_type, ...)
            bus->p is NULL

Joonsoo reported a problem when panicking before PCI was initialized.
I think this patch should be sufficient to replace the patch he posted
here: https://lkml.org/lkml/2012/12/28/75 ("[PATCH] x86, reboot: skip
reboot_fixups in early boot phase")
