ARM: davinci: da850 DT: add support for machine reboot

Update the da8xx_restart() function to support machine reboot
when booting using DT. Have the function search for the watchdog
platform device instead of always using "da8xx_wdt_device" which
is never registered in DT case.

While at it, also make da8xx_wdt_device static since there is no need
for it to be globally visible.

Tested machine reboot with both DT and non-DT boot on DA850 EVM.
