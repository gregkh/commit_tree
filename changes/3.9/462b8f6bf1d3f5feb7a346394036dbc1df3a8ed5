NFS: simplify and clean cache library

This is a cleanup patch.
Such helpers like nfs_cache_init() and nfs_cache_destroy() are redundant,
because they are just a wrappers around sunrpc_init_cache_detail() and
sunrpc_destroy_cache_detail() respectively.
So let's remove them completely and move corresponding logic to
nfs_cache_register_net() and nfs_cache_unregister_net() respectively (since
they are called together anyway).
