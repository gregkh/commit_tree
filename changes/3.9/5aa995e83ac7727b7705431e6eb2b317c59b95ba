ASoC: tegra: Don't claim to support PCM pause and resume

The tegra dmaengine driver does not support pausing and resuming a DMA stream.
The tegra PCM driver still claims to support pause and resume though and
implements them by stopping and restarting the stream. This is not what an
application using pause/resume would expect. Usually applications have support
for working around PCMs which do not support suspend and resume, so don't set
the SNDRV_PCM_INFO_PAUSE and SNDRV_PCM_INFO_RESUME flags for the tegra PCM and
use the default snd_dmaengine_pcm_trigger callback.
