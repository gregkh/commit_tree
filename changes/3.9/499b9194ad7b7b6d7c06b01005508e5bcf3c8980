i2c: sis630: fix behavior after collision

Datasheet on collision:
	SMBus Collision (SMBCOL_STS)
	This bit is set when a SMBus Collision condition occurs and
	SMBus Host loses in the bus arbitration. The software should
	clear this bit and re-start SMBus operation.

As the status will be cleared in transaction_end, we can remove the
sis630_write and prepare to return -EAGAIN to retry.
