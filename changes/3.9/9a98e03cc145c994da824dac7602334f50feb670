uprobes: _register() should always do register_for_each_vma(true)

To support the filtering uprobe_register() should do
register_for_each_vma(true) every time the new consumer comes,
we need to install the previously nacked breakpoints.

Note:
	- uprobes_mutex[] should die, what it actually protects is
	  alloc_uprobe().

	- UPROBE_RUN_HANDLER should die too, obviously it can't work
	  unless uprobe has a single consumer. The consumer should
	  serialize with _register/_unregister itself. Or this flag
	  should live in uprobe_consumer->state.

	- Perhaps we can do some optimizations later. For example, if
	  filter_chain() never returns false uprobe can record this
	  fact and avoid the unnecessary register_for_each_vma().
