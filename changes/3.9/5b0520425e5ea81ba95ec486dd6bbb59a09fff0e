ipv4: fix error handling in icmp_protocol.

Now we handle icmp errors in each transport protocol's err_handler,
for icmp protocols, that is ping_err. Since this handler only care
of those icmp errors triggered by echo request, errors triggered
by echo reply(which sent by kernel) are sliently ignored.

So wrap ping_err() with icmp_err() to deal with those icmp errors.
