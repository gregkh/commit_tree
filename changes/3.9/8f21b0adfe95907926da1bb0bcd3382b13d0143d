mac80211: call restart complete at wowlan resume time

When the driver's resume function can't completely
restore the configuration in the device, it returns
1 from the callback which will be treated like a HW
restart request, but done directly.

In this case, also call the driver's restart_complete()
function so it can finish the reconfiguration there.
