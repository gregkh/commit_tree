ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: add enable_preprogram hook

After setup/enable, some IP blocks need some additional setting to
indicate the PRCM that they are inactive until they are configured.
Some examples on OMAP4 include the AESS and FSUSB IP blocks.

To fix this cleanly, this patch adds another optional function
pointer, enable_preprogram, to the IP block's hwmod data.  The function
that is pointed to is called by the hwmod code immediately after the
IP block is reset.

This version of the patch includes a patch description fix from Felipe.
