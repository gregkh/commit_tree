ipack/devices/ipoctal: Fix race condition during Tx

In order to transmit data, the driver enables Tx and sleeps until
*board_write is set to 1 by the interrupt handler.

It can happen, though, that the data is sent even before the process
is asleep. In this case *board_write must be set to 1 anyway,
otherwise we will be waiting for a condition that will never be true.
