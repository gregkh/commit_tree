s390/modules: add relocation overflow checking

Given enough debug options some modules can grow large enough
that the GOT table gets bigger than 4K. On s390 the modules
are compiled with -fpic which limits the GOT to 4K. The end
result is a module that is loaded but won't work.

Add a sanity check to apply_rela and return with an error if
a relocation error is detected for a module.
