[media] bttv: avoid flooding the kernel log when i2c debugging is disabled

When the bttv driver is running without i2c_debug being set, the kernel
log is being flooded with the string ">". This string is really a part of
a debug message that is logged using several substrings protected by a
conditional check.
This patch adds the same conditional check to the leaked substring.
