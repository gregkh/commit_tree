mac82011: use frame control to differentiate probe resp/beacon

The probe response/beacon management frame RX code passes a
bool parameter to differentiate beacons and probe responses.
This is useless since we have the frame and can thus use its
frame control field. Moreover it is buggy since there is one
call to ieee80211_rx_bss_info with a beacon frame that is
indicated as a probe response, which is also fixed by using
the frame control field, so do that.
