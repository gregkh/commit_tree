drivers/net: delete the really obsolete 8390 based 10Mbit ISA drivers

This is an area I know all too well, after being author of several 8390
drivers, and maintainer of all 8390 drivers during a large part of their
active lifecycle.

To that end, I can say this with a reasonable degree of confidence.
The drivers deleted here represent the earliest (as in early 1990)
hardware and/or rare hardware.  The remaining hardware not deleted
here is the more modern/sane of the lot, with ISA-PnP and jumperless
"soft configuration" like the wd and smc cards had.

The original ne2000 driver (ne.c) gets a pass at this time since
AT/LANTIC based cards that could be both ne2000 or wd-like (with
shared memory) and with jumperless configuration were made in the
mid to late 1990's, and performed reasonably well for their era.
