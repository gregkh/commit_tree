afs: Support interacting with multiple user namespaces

Modify struct afs_file_status to store owner as a kuid_t and group as
a kgid_t.

In xdr_decode_AFSFetchStatus as owner is now a kuid_t and group is now
a kgid_t don't use the EXTRACT macro.  Instead perform the work of
the extract macro explicitly.  Read the value with ntohl and
convert it to the appropriate type with make_kuid or make_kgid.
Test if the value is different from what is stored in status and
update changed.   Update the value in status.

In xdr_encode_AFS_StoreStatus call from_kuid or from_kgid as
we are computing the on the wire encoding.

Initialize uids with GLOBAL_ROOT_UID instead of 0.
Initialize gids with GLOBAL_ROOT_GID instead of 0.
