ixgbe: Define FCoE and Flow director limits much sooner to allow for changes

Instead of adjusting the FCoE and Flow director limits based on the number
of CPUs we can define them much sooner.  This allows the user to come
through later and adjust them once we have updated the code to support the
set_channels ethtool operation.

I am still allowing for FCoE and RSS queues to be separated if the number
queues is less than the number of CPUs.  This essentially treats the two
groupings like they are two separate traffic classes.

In addition I am changing the initialization to use the MAX_TX/RX_QUEUES
defines instead of trying to compute the value as it will be possible in
upcoming patches for the user to request the maximum number of queues.

I have also updated things so that the upper limit on queues is exactly 63
instead of allowing it to go up to 64.  The reason for this change is to
address the fact thqt the driver only supports up to 63 queue vectors since
the hardware supports 64 MSI-X vectors, but one must be reserved for "other"
causes.
