arm64: Do not select GENERIC_HARDIRQS_NO_DEPRECATED

Config option GENERIC_HARDIRQS_NO_DEPRECATED was removed in commit
78c89825649a9a5ed526c507603196f467d781a5 ("genirq: Remove the now obsolete
config options and select statements"), but the select was accidentally
reintroduced in commit 8c2c3df31e3b87cb5348e48776c366ebd1dc5a7a ("arm64:
Build infrastructure").
