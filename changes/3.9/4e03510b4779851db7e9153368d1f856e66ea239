e1000e: fix PHY init workarounds for i217/i218

Toggling the LANPHYPC Value bit cycles the power on the PHY and sets it
back to power-on defaults.  This includes setting it's MAC-PHY messaging
mode to use the PCIe-like interconnect, so the MAC must also be set back
from SMBus mode to PCIe mode otherwise the PHY can be inaccessible.
