ipv[4|6]: correct dropwatch false positive in local_deliver_finish

I had a report recently of a user trying to use dropwatch to localise some frame
loss, and they were getting false positives.  Turned out they were using a user
space SCTP stack that used raw sockets to grab frames.  When we don't have a
registered protocol for a given packet, we record it as a drop, even if a raw
socket receieves the frame.  We should only record the drop in the event a raw
socket doesnt exist to receive the frames
