swap: make each swap partition have one address_space

When I use several fast SSD to do swap, swapper_space.tree_lock is
heavily contended.  This makes each swap partition have one
address_space to reduce the lock contention.  There is an array of
address_space for swap.  The swap entry type is the index to the array.

In my test with 3 SSD, this increases the swapout throughput 20%.
