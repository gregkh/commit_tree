ipv6: use a stronger hash for tcp

It looks like its possible to open thousands of TCP IPv6
sessions on a server, all landing in a single slot of TCP hash
table. Incoming packets have to lookup sockets in a very
long list.

We should hash all bits from foreign IPv6 addresses, using
a salt and hash mix, not a simple XOR.

inet6_ehashfn() can also separately use the ports, instead
of xoring them.
