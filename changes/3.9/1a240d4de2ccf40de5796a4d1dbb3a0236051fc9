drm/i915: fixup sparse warnings

- __iomem where there is none (I love how we mix these things up).
- Use gfp_t instead of an other plain type.
- Unconfuse one place about enum pipe vs enum transcoder - for the pch
  transcoder we actually use the pipe enum. Fixup the other cases
  where we assign the pipe to the cpu transcoder with explicit casts.
- Declare the mch_lock properly in a header.

There is still a decent mess in intel_bios.c about __iomem, but heck,
this is x86 and we're allowed to do that.

[danvet: Use a space after the cast consistently and fix up the
newly-added cast in i915_irq.c to properly use __iomem.]
