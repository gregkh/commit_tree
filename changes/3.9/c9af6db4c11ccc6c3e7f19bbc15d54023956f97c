net: Fix possible wrong checksum generation.

Patch cef401de7be8c4e (net: fix possible wrong checksum
generation) fixed wrong checksum calculation but it broke TSO by
defining new GSO type but not a netdev feature for that type.
net_gso_ok() would not allow hardware checksum/segmentation
offload of such packets without the feature.

Following patch fixes TSO and wrong checksum. This patch uses
same logic that Eric Dumazet used. Patch introduces new flag
SKBTX_SHARED_FRAG if at least one frag can be modified by
the user. but SKBTX_SHARED_FRAG flag is kept in skb shared
info tx_flags rather than gso_type.

tx_flags is better compared to gso_type since we can have skb with
shared frag without gso packet. It does not link SHARED_FRAG to
GSO, So there is no need to define netdev feature for this.
