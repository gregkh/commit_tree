ALSA: hda - Add fixup for Haswell to enable all pin and convertor widgets

Some Haswell machines support more than one display outputs (HDMI or DP),
but its BIOS may not enable the codec's 2nd and 3rd pin and output cvt widgets.

This patch implements a board-specific fixup for Intel Haswell Machines:
If the hidden pins are not enabled by BIOS, the driver will enable them
and call common code to update the codec tree.
