PCI: acpiphp: Keep driver loaded even if no slots found

Could have root bus hot-added later and there may be slots that need
acpiphp.

The result returned by acpiphp_get_num_slots() is meaningless, because
the bridge the slots are under may be added after this function has been
called, so drop acpiphp_get_num_slots() and the code using it.
