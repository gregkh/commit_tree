Revert "ALSA: hda - Allow power_save_controller option override DCAPS"

This reverts commit 6ab317419c62850a71e2adfd1573e5ee87d8774f.

The commit [6ab317419c: ALSA: hda - Allow power_save_controller option
override DCAPS] changed the behavior of power_save_controller so that
it can override the driver capability.  This assumed that this option
is rarely changed dynamically unlike power_save option.  Too naive.

It turned out that the user-space power-management tool tries to set
power_save_controller option to 1 together with power_save option
without knowing what's actually doing.  This enabled forcibly the
runtime PM of the controller,  which is known to be broken om many
chips thus disabled as default.

So, the only sane fix is to revert this commit again.  It was intended
to ease debugging/testing for runtime PM enablement, but obviously we
need another way for it.
