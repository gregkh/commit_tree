staging: comedi: addi_apci_3501: simplify eeprom read

This driver needs to read the on-board eeprom to determine the
number of analog output channels (4 or 8) on the board. But,
sinde we know the board has an eeprom and the PCI controller
chip is an AMCC S5933, we can simplify the code and remove the
code that sets the extra wait state neede for the AMCC S5920.
