drm: Introduce an iterator over holes in the drm_mm range manager

This will be used i915 in forthcoming patches in order to measure the
largest contiguous chunk of memory available for enabling chipset
features.

v2: Try to make the macro marginally safer and more readable by not
depending upon the drm_mm_hole_node_end() being non-zero. Note that we
need to open code list_for_each() in order to update the hole_start,
hole_end variable on each iteration and keep the macro sane.

v3: Tidy up few BUG_ONs that fell foul of adding additional tests to
drm_mm_hole_node_start().
