ARM: OMAP4: clock data: Add missing clkdm association for dpll_usb

dpll_usb needs the clkdm association so the clkdm can be
turned on before a relock. All other dplls for omap4 belong
to the ALWON (always on) domain.

The association was present as part of the older data file
(clock44xx_data.c) but looks like got accidently dropped with
the common clk convertion.

More details of the patch which fixed this up in the older
data file can be dound here..

Adding the .clkdm_name as part of the clk_hw_omap struct also
means a new .init needs to be part of the clk_ops for dpll_usb
to initialise the clkdm.
