s390/pci: cleanup clp page allocation

Use the __get_free_pages wrapper in clp_alloc_block. Also change the
allocation to use one page only. This page is used as CLP response
block e.g. to list available pci functions. Using one page we can
list > 250 pci functions at once and we have code to loop around this
CLP command (if not all functions fit into to the CLP block) already
in place.
