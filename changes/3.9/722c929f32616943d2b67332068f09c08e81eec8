ACPI: Do not use device power states of power resources

ACPI power resource objects have struct acpi_device components, but
they are only used for registering those resources in the device
hierarchy.  In particular, power state information stored in them is
completely useless (amnong other things, because the power resources
"devices" are not power manageable), so there is no reason for the
power resources management code to keep it up to date.

Remove the code updating device power states of power resources from
drivers/acpi/power.c.
