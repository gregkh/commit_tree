x86: Hyper-V: register clocksource only if its advertised

Enable hyperv_clocksource only if its advertised as a feature.
XenServer 6 returns the signature which is checked in
ms_hyperv_platform(), but it does not offer all features. Currently the
clocksource is enabled unconditionally in ms_hyperv_init_platform(), and
the result is a hanging guest.

Hyper-V spec Bit 1 indicates the availability of Partition Reference
Counter.  Register the clocksource only if this bit is set.

The guest in question prints this in dmesg:
 [    0.000000] Hypervisor detected: Microsoft HyperV
 [    0.000000] HyperV: features 0x70, hints 0x0

This bug can be reproduced easily be setting 'viridian=1' in a HVM domU
.cfg file. A workaround without this patch is to boot the HVM guest with
'clocksource=jiffies'.
