[media] dvb_frontend: fix ioctls failing if frontend open/closed too fast

That likely fixes this MythTV ticket:
	http://code.mythtv.org/trac/ticket/10830
(which btw affects all usb tuners I tested as well, pctv452e,
dib0700, af9015)  pctv452e is still possibly broken with MythTV
even after this fix; it does work with VDR here tho despite I2C
errors.
Reduced testcase:

Thanx to devinheitmueller and crope from #linuxtv for helping with
this fix! :)
