x86,efi: Implement efi_no_storage_paranoia parameter

Using this parameter one can disable the storage_size/2 check if
he is really sure that the UEFI does sane gc and fulfills the spec.

This parameter is useful if a devices uses more than 50% of the
storage by default.
The Intel DQSW67 desktop board is such a sucker for exmaple.
