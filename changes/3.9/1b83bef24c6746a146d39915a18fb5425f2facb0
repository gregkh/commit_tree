libceph: update osd request/reply encoding

Use the new version of the encoding for osd requests and replies.  In the
process, update the way we are tracking request ops and reply lengths and
results in the struct ceph_osd_request.  Update the rbd and fs/ceph users
appropriately.

The main changes are:
 - we keep pointers into the request memory for fields we need to update
   each time the request is sent out over the wire
 - we keep information about the result in an array in the request struct
   where the users can easily get at it.
