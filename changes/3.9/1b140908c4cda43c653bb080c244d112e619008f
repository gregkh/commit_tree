dma: tegra: add support for channel wise pause

NVIDIA's some SoCs like Tegra114 support the channel wise pause control
inplace of global pause which pauses all DMA channels. When SoCs support
the channel wise pause control then it uses the global pause for clock
gating for register access as well as all DMA channel pause. Hence DMA
registers are not accessible if DMAs are globally paused on these new SoCs.

Add support for channel wise pause feature if SoCs support it.
