ext4: fix big-endian bugs which could cause fs corruptions

When an extent was zeroed out, we forgot to do convert from cpu to le16.
It could make us hit a BUG_ON when we try to write dirty pages out.  So
fix it.

[ Also fix a bug found by Dmitry Monakhov where we were missing
  le32_to_cpu() calls in the new indirect punch hole code.

  There are a number of other big endian warnings found by static code
  analyzers, but we'll wait for the next merge window to fix them all
  up.  These fixes are designed to be Obviously Correct by code
  inspection, and easy to demonstrate that it won't make any
  difference (and hence, won't introduce any bugs) on little endian
  architectures such as x86.  --tytso ]
