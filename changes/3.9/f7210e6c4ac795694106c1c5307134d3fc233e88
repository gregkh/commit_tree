mm/memblock.c: use CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP to protect movablecore_map in memblock_overlaps_region().

The definition of struct movablecore_map is protected by
CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP but its use in memblock_overlaps_region()
is not.  So add CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP to protect the use of
movablecore_map in memblock_overlaps_region().
