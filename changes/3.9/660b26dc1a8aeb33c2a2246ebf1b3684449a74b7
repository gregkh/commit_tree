mcast: add multicast proxy support (IPv4 and IPv6)

This patch add the support of proxy multicast, ie being able to build a static
multicast tree. It adds the support of (*,*) and (*,G) entries.

The user should define an (*,*) entry which is not used for real forwarding.
This entry defines the upstream in iif and contains all interfaces from the
static tree in its oifs. It will be used to forward packet upstream when they
come from an interface belonging to the static tree.
Hence, the user should define (*,G) entries to build its static tree. Note that
upstream interface must be part of oifs: packets are sent to all oifs
interfaces except the input interface. This ensures to always join the whole
static tree, even if the packet is not coming from the upstream interface.
