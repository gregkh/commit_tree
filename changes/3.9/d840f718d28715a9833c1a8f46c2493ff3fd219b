tracing: Init current_trace to nop_trace and remove NULL checks

On early boot up, when the ftrace ring buffer is initialized, the
static variable current_trace is initialized to &nop_trace.
Before this initialization, current_trace is NULL and will never
become NULL again. It is always reassigned to a ftrace tracer.

Several places check if current_trace is NULL before it uses
it, and this check is frivolous, because at the point in time
when the checks are made the only way current_trace could be
NULL is if ftrace failed its allocations at boot up, and the
paths to these locations would probably not be possible.

By initializing current_trace to &nop_trace where it is declared,
current_trace will never be NULL, and we can remove all these
checks of current_trace being NULL which never needed to be
checked in the first place.
