KVM: SVM: Unconditionally invoke sev_hardware_teardown()

Remove the redundant svm_sev_enabled() check when calling
sev_hardware_teardown(), the teardown helper itself does the check.
Removing the check from svm.c will eventually allow dropping
svm_sev_enabled() entirely.

No functional change intended.
