spi: spi-zynqmp-gqspi: fix incorrect operating mode in zynqmp_qspi_read_op

When starting a read operation, we should call zynqmp_qspi_setuprxdma
first to set xqspi->mode according to xqspi->bytes_to_receive and
to calculate correct xqspi->dma_rx_bytes. Then in the function
zynqmp_qspi_fillgenfifo, generate the appropriate command with
operating mode and bytes to transfer, and fill the GENFIFO with
the command to perform the read operation.

Calling zynqmp_qspi_fillgenfifo before zynqmp_qspi_setuprxdma will
result in incorrect transfer length and operating mode. So change
the calling order to fix this issue.
