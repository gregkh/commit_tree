arm64: dts: ti: j7200-main: Mark Main NAVSS as dma-coherent

Traffic through main NAVSS interconnect is coherent wrt ARM caches on
J7200 SoC.  Add missing dma-coherent property to main_navss node.

Also add dma-ranges to be consistent with mcu_navss node
and with AM65/J721e main_navss and mcu_navss nodes.
