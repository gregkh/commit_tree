crypto: s5p-sss - initialize APB clock after the AXI bus clock for SlimSSS

The driver for Slim Security Subsystem (SlimSSS) on Exynos5433 takes two
clocks - aclk (AXI/AHB clock) and pclk (APB/Advanced Peripheral Bus
clock).  The "aclk", as main high speed bus clock, is enabled first.  Then
the "pclk" is enabled.

However the driver assigned reversed names for lookup of these clocks
from devicetree, so effectively the "pclk" was enabled first.

Although it might not matter in reality, the correct order is to enable
first main/high speed bus clock - "aclk".  Also this was the intention
of the actual code.
