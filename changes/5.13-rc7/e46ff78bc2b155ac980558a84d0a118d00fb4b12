staging: rtl8188eu: remove the last urb callback macros

Both usb_read_port_complete and usb_write_port_complete have a regs
parameter that is not used.

When this parameter is removed, the functions can be used as urb
completion callbacks directly. There's no need for the macros that
strip the second parameter.
