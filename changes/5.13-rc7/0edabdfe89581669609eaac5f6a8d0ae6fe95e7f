ALSA: bebob/oxfw: fix Kconfig entry for Mackie d.2 Pro

Mackie d.2 has an extension card for IEEE 1394 communication, which uses
BridgeCo DM1000 ASIC. On the other hand, Mackie d.4 Pro has built-in
function for IEEE 1394 communication by Oxford Semiconductor OXFW971,
according to schematic diagram available in Mackie website. Although I
misunderstood that Mackie d.2 Pro would be also a model with OXFW971,
it's wrong. Mackie d.2 Pro is a model which includes the extension card
as factory settings.

This commit fixes entries in Kconfig and comment in ALSA OXFW driver.
