usb: dwc2: Clear GINTSTS_RESTOREDONE bit after restore is generated.

When hibernation exit is performed the dwc2_hib_restore_common()
function is called. In that function we wait until GINTSTS_RESTOREDONE
bit is set. However, after the setting of that bit we get a lot of
(dwc2_hsotg_irq:) interrupts which indicates that (GINTSTS.RstrDoneInt)
restore done interrupt is asserted.

To avoid restore done interrupt storm after restore is generated
clear GINTSTS_RESTOREDONE bit in GINTSTS register.
