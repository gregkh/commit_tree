btrfs: zoned: move log tree node allocation out of log_root_tree->log_mutex

Commit 6e37d2459941 ("btrfs: zoned: fix deadlock on log sync") pointed out
a deadlock warning and removed mutex_{lock,unlock} of fs_info::tree_root->log_mutex.
While it looks like it always cause a deadlock, we didn't see actual
deadlock in fstests runs. The reason is log_root_tree->log_mutex !=
fs_info->tree_root->log_mutex, not taking the same lock. So, the warning
was actually a false-positive.

Since btrfs_alloc_log_tree_node() is protected only by
fs_info->tree_root->log_mutex, we can (and should) move the code out of
the lock scope of log_root_tree->log_mutex and silence the warning.
