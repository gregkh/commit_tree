btrfs: zoned: fix zone number to sector/physical calculation

In btrfs_get_dev_zone_info(), we have "u32 sb_zone" and calculate "sector_t
sector" by shifting it. But, this "sector" is calculated in 32bit, leading
it to be 0 for the 2nd superblock copy.

Since zone number is u32, shifting it to sector (sector_t) or physical
address (u64) can easily trigger a missing cast bug like this.

This commit introduces helpers to convert zone number to sector/LBA, so we
won't fall into the same pitfall again.
