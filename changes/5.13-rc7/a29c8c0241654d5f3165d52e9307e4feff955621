drm/msm/disp/dpu1: fix display underruns during modeset.

During crtc disable, display perf structures are reset to 0
which includes state varibles which are immutable. On crtc
enable, we use the same structures and they don't refelect
the actual values

1) Fix is to avoid updating the state structures during disable.
2) Reset the perf structures during atomic check when there is no
modeset enable.
