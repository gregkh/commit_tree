net/sched: fq_pie: re-factor fix for fq_pie endless loop

the patch that fixed an endless loop in_fq_pie_init() was not considering
that 65535 is a valid class id. The correct bugfix for this infinite loop
is to change 'idx' to become an u32, like Colin proposed in the past [1].

Fix this as follows:
 - restore 65536 as maximum possible values of 'flows_cnt'
 - use u32 'idx' when iterating on 'q->flows'
 - fix the TDC selftest

This reverts commit bb2f930d6dd708469a587dc9ed1efe1ef969c0bf.
