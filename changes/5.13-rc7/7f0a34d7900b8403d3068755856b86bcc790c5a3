thunderbolt: Decrease control channel timeout for software connection manager

When the firmware connection manager is not proxying between the
software and the hardware we can decrease the timeout for control
packets significantly. The USB4 spec recommends 10 ms +- 1 ms but we use
slightly larger value (100 ms) which is recommendation from Intel
Thunderbolt firmware folks. When firmware connection manager is running
then we keep using the existing 5000 ms.

To implement this we move the control channel allocation to
tb_domain_alloc(), and pass the timeout from that function to the
tb_ctl_alloc(). Then make both connection manager implementations pass
the timeout when they alloc the domain structure.

While there update kernel-doc of struct tb_ctl to match the reality.
