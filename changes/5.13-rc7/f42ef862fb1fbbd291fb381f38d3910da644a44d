drm/amd/display: Add dynamic link encoder selection.

[Why]
Some display endpoints may be programmably mapped to compatible link
encoders. The assignment of link encoders to links has to be dynamic to
accommodate the increased flexibility in comparison to conventional
display endpoints.

[How]
- Add link encoder assignment tracking variables.
- Execute link encoder assignment algorithm before enabling link and
release link encoders from links once they are disabled.
