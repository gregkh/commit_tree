KVM: x86: dump_vmcs should not assume GUEST_IA32_EFER is valid

If the VM entry/exit controls for loading/saving MSR_EFER are either
not available (an older processor or explicitly disabled) or not
used (host and guest values are the same), reading GUEST_IA32_EFER
from the VMCS returns an inaccurate value.

Because of this, in dump_vmcs() don't use GUEST_IA32_EFER to decide
whether to print the PDPTRs - always do so if the fields exist.
