nfsd: report client confirmation status in "info" file

mountd can now monitor clients appearing and disappearing in
/proc/fs/nfsd/clients, and will log these events, in liu of the logging
of mount/unmount events for NFSv3.

Currently it cannot distinguish between unconfirmed clients (which might
be transient and totally uninteresting) and confirmed clients.

So add a "status: " line which reports either "confirmed" or
"unconfirmed", and use fsnotify to report that the info file
has been modified.

This requires a bit of infrastructure to keep the dentry for the "info"
file.  There is no need to take a counted reference as the dentry must
remain around until the client is removed.
