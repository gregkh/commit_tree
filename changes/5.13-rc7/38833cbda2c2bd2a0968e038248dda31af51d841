usb: misc: usbsevseg: update to use usb_control_msg_send()

The newer usb_control_msg_{send|recv}() API ensures that a short read is
treated as an error, data can be used off the stack, and raw usb pipes
need not be created in the calling functions.
For this reason, instances of usb_control_msg() have been replaced with
usb_control_msg_send() appropriately.
