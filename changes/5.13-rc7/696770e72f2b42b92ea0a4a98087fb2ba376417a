scsi: lpfc: Fix failure to transmit ABTS on FC link

The abort_cmd_ia flag in an abort wqe describes whether an ABTS basic link
service should be transmitted on the FC link or not.  Code added in
lpfc_sli4_issue_abort_iotag() set the abort_cmd_ia flag incorrectly,
surpressing ABTS transmission.

A previous LPFC change to build an abort wqe inverted prior logic that
determined whether an ABTS was to be issued on the FC link.

Revert this logic to its proper state.
