bpf, devmap: Move drop error path to devmap for XDP_REDIRECT

We want to change the current ndo_xdp_xmit drop semantics because it will
allow us to implement better queue overflow handling. This is working
towards the larger goal of a XDP TX queue-hook. Move XDP_REDIRECT error
path handling from each XDP ethernet driver to devmap code. According to
the new APIs, the driver running the ndo_xdp_xmit pointer, will break tx
loop whenever the hw reports a tx error and it will just return to devmap
caller the number of successfully transmitted frames. It will be devmap
responsibility to free dropped frames.

Move each XDP ndo_xdp_xmit capable driver to the new APIs:

- veth
- virtio-net
- mvneta
- mvpp2
- socionext
- amazon ena
- bnxt
- freescale (dpaa2, dpaa)
- xen-frontend
- qede
- ice
- igb
- ixgbe
- i40e
- mlx5
- ti (cpsw, cpsw-new)
- tun
- sfc
