libbpf: Mark BPF subprogs with hidden visibility as static for BPF verifier

Define __hidden helper macro in bpf_helpers.h, which is a short-hand for
__attribute__((visibility("hidden"))). Add libbpf support to mark BPF
subprograms marked with __hidden as static in BTF information to enforce BPF
verifier's static function validation algorithm, which takes more information
(caller's context) into account during a subprogram validation.
