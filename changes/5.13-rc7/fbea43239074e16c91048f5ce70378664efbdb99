vfio/mdev: Remove duplicate storage of parent in mdev_device

mdev_device->type->parent is the same thing.

The struct mdev_device was relying on the kref on the mdev_parent to also
indirectly hold a kref on the mdev_type pointer. Now that the type holds a
kref on the parent we can directly kref the mdev_type and remove this
implicit relationship.
