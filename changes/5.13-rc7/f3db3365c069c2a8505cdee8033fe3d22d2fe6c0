x86/sev-es: Remove subtraction of res variable

vc_decode_insn() calls copy_from_kernel_nofault() by way of
vc_fetch_insn_kernel() to fetch 15 bytes max of opcodes to decode.

copy_from_kernel_nofault() returns negative on error and 0 on success.
The error case is handled by returning ES_EXCEPTION.

In the success case, the ret variable which contains the return value is
0 so there's no need to subtract it from MAX_INSN_SIZE when initializing
the insn buffer for further decoding. Remove it.

No functional changes.
