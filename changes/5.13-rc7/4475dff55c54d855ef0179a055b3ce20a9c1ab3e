kbuild: fix false-positive modpost warning when all symbols are trimmed

Nathan reports that the mips defconfig emits the following warning:

  WARNING: modpost: Symbol info of vmlinux is missing. Unresolved symbol check will be entirely skipped.

This false-positive happens when CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS is enabled,
but no CONFIG option is set to 'm'.

Commit a0590473c5e6 ("nfs: fix PNFS_FLEXFILE_LAYOUT Kconfig default")
turned the last 'm' into 'y' for the mips defconfig, and uncovered
this issue.

In this case, the module feature itself is enabled, but we have no
module to build. As a result, CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS drops all the
instances of EXPORT_SYMBOL. Then, modpost wrongly assumes vmlinux is
missing because vmlinux.symvers is empty. (As another false-positive
case, you can create a module that does not use any symbol of vmlinux).

The current behavior is to entirely suppress the unresolved symbol
warnings when vmlinux is missing just because there are too many.
I found the origin of this code in the historical git tree. [1]

If this is a matter of noisiness, I think modpost can display the
first 10 warnings, and the number of suppressed warnings at the end.

You will get a bit noisier logs when you run 'make modules' without
vmlinux, but such warnings are better to show because you never know
the resulting modules are actually loadable or not.

This commit changes the following:

 - If any of input *.symver files is missing, pass -w option to let
   the module build keep going with warnings instead of errors.

 - If there are too many (10+) unresolved symbol warnings, show only
   the first 10, and also the number of suppressed warnings.
