perf metricgroup: Return error code from metricgroup__add_metric_sys_event_iter()

The error code is not set at all in the sys event iter function.

This may lead to an uninitialized value of "ret" in
metricgroup__add_metric() when no CPU metric is added.

Fix by properly setting the error code.

It is not necessary to init "ret" to 0 in metricgroup__add_metric(), as
if we have no CPU or sys event metric matching, then "has_match" should
be 0 and "ret" is set to -EINVAL.

However gcc cannot detect that it may not have been set after the
map_for_each_metric() loop for CPU metrics, which is strange.
