btrfs: fix comment for btrfs ordered extent flag bits

There is small error in comment about BTRFS_ORDERED_* flags, added in
commit 3c198fe06449 ("btrfs: rework the order of
btrfs_ordered_extent::flags") but the fixup did not get merged in time.

The 4 types are for ordered extent itself, not for direct io.
Only 3 types support direct io, REGULAR/NOCOW/PREALLOC.

Fix the comment to reflect that.
