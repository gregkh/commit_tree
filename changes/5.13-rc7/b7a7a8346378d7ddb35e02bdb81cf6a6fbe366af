btrfs: make reflinks respect O_SYNC O_DSYNC and S_SYNC flags

If we reflink to or from a file opened with O_SYNC/O_DSYNC or to/from a
file that has the S_SYNC attribute set, we totally ignore that and do not
durably persist the reflink changes. Since a reflink can change the data
readable from a file (and mtime/ctime, or a file size), it makes sense to
durably persist (fsync) the source and destination files/ranges.

This was previously discussed at:

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-btrfs/20200903035225.GJ6090@magnolia/

The recently introduced test case generic/628, from fstests, exercises
these scenarios and currently fails without this change.

So make sure we fsync the source and destination files/ranges when either
of them was opened with O_SYNC/O_DSYNC or has the S_SYNC attribute set,
just like XFS already does.
