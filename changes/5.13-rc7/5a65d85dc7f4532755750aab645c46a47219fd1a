net/mlx5e: Register nic devlink port with switch id

We will re-use the native NIC port net device instance for the Uplink
representor. Since the netdev will be kept registered while we engage
switchdev mode also the devlink will be kept registered.
Register the nic devlink port with switch id so it will be available
when changing profiles.
