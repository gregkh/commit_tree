tty: serial: ucc_uart: replace qe_io{read,write}* wrappers by generic io{read,write}*

Commit 6ac9b61786cc ("soc: fsl: qe: introduce qe_io{read,write}*
wrappers") added specific I/O accessors for qe because at that
time ioread/iowrite functions were sub-optimal on powerpc/32
compared to the architecture specific in_/out_ IO accessors.

But as ioread/iowrite accessors are now equivalent since
commit 894fa235eb4c ("powerpc: inline iomap accessors"),
use them in order to allow removal of the qe specific ones.
