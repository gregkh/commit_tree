iio: core: wrap iio device & buffer into struct for character devices

In order to keep backwards compatibility with the current chardev
mechanism, and in order to add support for multiple buffers per IIO device,
we need to pass both the IIO device & IIO buffer to the chardev.

This is particularly needed for the iio_buffer_read_outer() function, where
we need to pass another buffer object than 'indio_dev->buffer'.

Since we'll also open some chardevs via anon inodes, we can pass extra
buffers in that function by assigning another object to the
iio_dev_buffer_pair object.
