io_uring: fix race around poll update and poll triggering

Joakim reports that in some conditions he sees a multishot poll request
being canceled, and that it coincides with getting -EALREADY on
modification. As part of the poll update procedure, there's a small window
where the request is marked as canceled, and if this coincides with the
event actually triggering, then we can get a spurious -ECANCELED and
termination of the multishot request.

Don't mark the poll request as being canceled for update. We also don't
care if we race on removal unless it's a one-shot request, we can safely
updated for either case.
