x86/sev: Check SME/SEV support in CPUID first

The first two bits of the CPUID leaf 0x8000001F EAX indicate whether SEV
or SME is supported, respectively. It's better to check whether SEV or
SME is actually supported before accessing the MSR_AMD64_SEV to check
whether SEV or SME is enabled.

This is both a bare-metal issue and a guest/VM issue. Since the first
generation Hygon Dhyana CPU doesn't support the MSR_AMD64_SEV, reading that
MSR results in a #GP - either directly from hardware in the bare-metal
case or via the hypervisor (because the RDMSR is actually intercepted)
in the guest/VM case, resulting in a failed boot. And since this is very
early in the boot phase, rdmsrl_safe()/native_read_msr_safe() can't be
used.

So check the CPUID bits first, before accessing the MSR.
