x86/alternative: Support ALTERNATIVE_TERNARY

Add ALTERNATIVE_TERNARY support for replacing an initial instruction
with either of two instructions depending on a feature:

  ALTERNATIVE_TERNARY "default_instr", FEATURE_NR,
                      "feature_on_instr", "feature_off_instr"

which will start with "default_instr" and at patch time will,
depending on FEATURE_NR being set or not, patch that with either
"feature_on_instr" or "feature_off_instr".
