hwmon: (scpi-hwmon) shows the negative temperature properly

The scpi hwmon shows the sub-zero temperature in an unsigned integer,
which would confuse the users when the machine works in low temperature
environment. This shows the sub-zero temperature in an signed value and
users can get it properly from sensors.
