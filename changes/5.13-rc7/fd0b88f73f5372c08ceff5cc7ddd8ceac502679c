bpf: Refine retval for bpf_get_task_stack helper

Verifier can constrain the min/max bounds of bpf_get_task_stack's return
value more tightly than the default tnum_unknown. Like bpf_get_stack,
return value is num bytes written into a caller-supplied buf, or error,
so do_refine_retval_range will work.
