ALSA: HDA - remove the custom implementation for the audio LED trigger

With the new snd-ctl-led module, we have a generic way
to trigger audio LEDs based on the sound control changes.

Remove the custom implementation from the HDA driver.

Move the LED initialization before snd_hda_gen_parse_auto_config()
call in all drivers to create marked controls there.
