drm/i915: Convert i915_gem_object_attach_phys() to ww locking, v2.

Simple adding of i915_gem_object_lock, we may start to pass ww to
get_pages() in the future, but that won't be the case here;
We override shmem's get_pages() handling by calling
i915_gem_object_get_pages_phys(), no ww is needed.

Changes since v1:
- Call shmem put pages directly, the callback would
  go down the phys free path.
