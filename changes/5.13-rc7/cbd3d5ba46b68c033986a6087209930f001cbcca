powerpc/fadump: Fix compile error since trap type change

sfr reports that the allyesconfig build fails with:

  arch/powerpc/kernel/fadump.c: In function 'crash_fadump':
  arch/powerpc/kernel/fadump.c:731:28: error: 'INTERRUPT_SYSTEM_RESET' undeclared
    731 |  if (TRAP(&(fdh->regs)) == INTERRUPT_SYSTEM_RESET) {

Add an include of interrupt.h to fix it.
