mmc: core: Let eMMC sanitize not retry in case of timeout/failure

Not all commands need to be retried in case of a timeout/failure. This is
the case for the eMMC sanitize command, for example, which is issued
through the ioctl interface. More precisely, in case of timeout, retrying
could make the user wait for a very long time as each retry loop could last
for a couple of minutes.

Therefore, let's not use retries for the eMMC sanitize command.
