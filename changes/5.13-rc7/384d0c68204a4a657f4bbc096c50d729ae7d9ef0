PCI/VPD: Remove pci_set_vpd_size()

24a1720a0841 ("cxgb4: collect serial config version from register") removed
the only usage of pci_set_vpd_size(). If a device needs to override the
auto-detected VPD size, then this can be done with a PCI quirk, as is done
for Chelsio devices. There's no need to allow drivers to change the VPD
size.

Remove pci_set_vpd_size().
