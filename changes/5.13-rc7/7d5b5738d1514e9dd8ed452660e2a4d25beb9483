dma-mapping: add a dma_alloc_noncontiguous API

Add a new API that returns a potentiall virtually non-contigous sg_table
and a DMA address.  This API is only properly implemented for dma-iommu
and will simply return a contigious chunk as a fallback.

The intent is that drivers can use this API if either:

 - no kernel mapping or only temporary kernel mappings are required.
   That is as a better replacement for DMA_ATTR_NO_KERNEL_MAPPING
 - a kernel mapping is required for cached and DMA mapped pages, but
   the driver also needs the pages to e.g. map them to userspace.
   In that sense it is a replacement for some aspects of the recently
   removed and never fully implemented DMA_ATTR_NON_CONSISTENT
