net: ieee802154: mrf24j40: Drop unneeded of_match_ptr()

Driver can be used in different environments and moreover, when compiled
with !OF, the compiler may issue a warning due to unused mrf24j40_of_match
variable. Hence drop unneeded of_match_ptr() call.

While at it, update headers block to reflect above changes.
