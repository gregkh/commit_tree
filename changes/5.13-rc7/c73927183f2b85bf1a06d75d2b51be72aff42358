drm/i915/tgl+: Sanitize the DDI LANES/IO and AUX power domain names

In Bspec the TGL TypeC ports are TC1-6, the AUX power well request flags
are USBC1-6/TBT1-6, so for clarity use these names in the port power
domain names instead of the D-I terminology (which Bspec uses only for
the ICL TypeC ports).

A domain name should follow the <domain>_<pipe/transcoder/port/aux_ch>
format. Add the new aliases based on this, leaving a change to rename
all the rest accordingly for a follow-up.

No functional change.

v2: Add comment to commit log about unifying domain names. (Jose)
