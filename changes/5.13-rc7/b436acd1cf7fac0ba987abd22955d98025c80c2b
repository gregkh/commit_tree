drm: Fix use-after-free read in drm_getunique()

There is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm_getunique() due
to retrieving file_priv->master prior to locking the device's master
mutex.

An example can be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error
found by Syzbot:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803

In the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This is
because another process had acquired the device's master mutex in
drm_setmaster_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv->master in
drm_new_set_master(). The old value of fpriv->master was subsequently
freed before the mutex was unlocked.

To fix this, we lock the device's master mutex before retrieving the
pointer from from fpriv->master. This patch passes the Syzbot
reproducer test.
