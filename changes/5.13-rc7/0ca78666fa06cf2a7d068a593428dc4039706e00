vfio/fsl-mc: Use vfio_init/register/unregister_group_dev

fsl-mc already allocates a struct vfio_fsl_mc_device with exactly the same
lifetime as vfio_device, switch to the new API and embed vfio_device in
vfio_fsl_mc_device. While here remove the devm usage for the vdev, this
code is clean and doesn't need devm.
