f2fs: do not use AT_SSR mode in FG_GC & high urgent BG_GC

AT_SSR mode is introduced by age threshold based GC for better
hot/cold data seperation and avoiding free segment cost. However,
LFS write mode is preferred in the scenario of foreground or high
urgent GC, which should be finished ASAP. Let's only use AT_SSR
in background GC and not high urgent GC modes.
