drm/msm/dpu: fill missing details in hw catalog for sdm845 and sm8[12]50

Fill clk_inefficiency_factor, bw_inefficiency_factor and
min_prefill_lines in hw catalog data for sdm845 and sm8[12]50.

Efficiency factors are blindly copied from sc7180 data, while
min_prefill_lines is based on downstream display driver.
