backlight: qcom-wled: Fix FSC update issue for WLED5

Currently, for WLED5, the FSC (Full scale current) setting is not
updated properly due to driver toggling the wrong register after
an FSC update.

On WLED5 we should only toggle the MOD_SYNC bit after a brightness
update. For an FSC update we need to toggle the SYNC bits instead.

Fix it by adopting the common wled3_sync_toggle() for WLED5 and
introducing new code to the brightness update path to compensate.
