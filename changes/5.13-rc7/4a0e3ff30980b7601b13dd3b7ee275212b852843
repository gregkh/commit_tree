perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix a kernel WARNING triggered by maxcpus=1

A kernel WARNING may be triggered when setting maxcpus=1.

The uncore counters are Die-scope. When probing a PCI device, only the
BUS information can be retrieved. The uncore driver has to maintain a
mapping table used to calculate the logical Die ID from a given BUS#.

Before the patch ba9506be4e40, the mapping table stores the mapping
information from the BUS# -> a Physical Socket ID. To calculate the
logical die ID, perf does,
- In snbep_pci2phy_map_init(), retrieve the BUS# -> a Physical Socket ID
  from the UBOX PCI configure space.
- Calculate the mapping information (a BUS# -> a Physical Socket ID) for
  the other PCI BUS.
- In the uncore_pci_probe(), get the physical Socket ID from a given BUS
  and the mapping table.
- Calculate the logical Die ID

Since only the logical Die ID is required, with the patch ba9506be4e40,
the mapping table stores the mapping information from the BUS# -> a
logical Die ID. Now perf does,
- In snbep_pci2phy_map_init(), retrieve the BUS# -> a Physical Socket ID
  from the UBOX PCI configure space.
- Calculate the logical Die ID
- Calculate the mapping information (a BUS# -> a logical Die ID) for the
  other PCI BUS.
- In the uncore_pci_probe(), get the logical die ID from a given BUS and
  the mapping table.

When calculating the logical Die ID, -1 may be returned, especially when
maxcpus=1. Here, -1 means the logical Die ID is not found. But when
calculating the mapping information for the other PCI BUS, -1 indicates
that it's the other PCI BUS that requires the calculation of the
mapping. The driver will mistakenly do the calculation.

Uses the -ENODEV to indicate the case which the logical Die ID is not
found. The driver will not mess up the mapping table anymore.

Fixes: ba9506be4e40 ("perf/x86/intel/uncore: Store the logical die id instead of the physical die id.")
