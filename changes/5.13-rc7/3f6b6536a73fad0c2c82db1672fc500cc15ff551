software node: Free resources explicitly when swnode_register() fails

Currently we have a slightly twisted logic in swnode_register().
It frees resources that it doesn't allocate on error path and
in once case it relies on the ->release() implementation.

Untwist the logic by freeing resources explicitly when swnode_register()
fails. Currently it happens only in fwnode_create_software_node().
