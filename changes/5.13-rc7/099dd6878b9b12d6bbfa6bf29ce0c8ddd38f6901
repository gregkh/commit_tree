mm/swap: fix pte_same_as_swp() not removing uffd-wp bit when compare

I found it by pure code review, that pte_same_as_swp() of unuse_vma()
didn't take uffd-wp bit into account when comparing ptes.
pte_same_as_swp() returning false negative could cause failure to
swapoff swap ptes that was wr-protected by userfaultfd.
