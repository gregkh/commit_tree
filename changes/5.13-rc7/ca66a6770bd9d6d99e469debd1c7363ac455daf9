HID: i2c-hid: Skip ELAN power-on command after reset

For ELAN touchscreen, we found our boot code of IC was not flexible enough
to receive and handle this command.
Once the FW main code of our controller is crashed for some reason,
the controller could not be enumerated successfully to be recognized
by the system host. therefore, it lost touch functionality.

Add quirk for skip send power-on command after reset.
It will impact to ELAN touchscreen and touchpad on HID over I2C projects.
