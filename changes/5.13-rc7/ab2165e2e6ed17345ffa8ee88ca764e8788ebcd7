ALSA: usb-audio: Add dB range mapping for Sennheiser Communications Headset PC 8

The decibel volume range contains a negative maximum value resulting in
pipewire complaining about the device and effectivly having no sound
output. The wrong values also resulted in the headset sounding muted
already at a mixer level of about ~25%.
