drm/dp: Fixup kernel docs for struct drm_dp_aux

* Make sure that struct members are referred to using @, otherwise they
  won't be formatted as such
* Make sure to refer to other struct types using & so they link back to
  each struct's definition
* Make sure to precede constant values with % so they're formatted
  correctly
