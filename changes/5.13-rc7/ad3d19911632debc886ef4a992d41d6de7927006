um: Disable CONFIG_GCOV with MODULES

CONFIG_GCOV doesn't work with modules, and for various reasons
it cannot work, see also
https://lore.kernel.org/r/d36ea54d8c0a8dd706826ba844a6f27691f45d55.camel@sipsolutions.net

Make CONFIG_GCOV depend on !MODULES to avoid anyone
running into issues there. This also means we need
not export the gcov symbols.
