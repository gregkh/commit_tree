libbpf: Extract internal set-of-strings datastructure APIs

Extract BTF logic for maintaining a set of strings data structure, used for
BTF strings section construction in writable mode, into separate re-usable
API. This data structure is going to be used by bpf_linker to maintains ELF
STRTAB section, which has the same layout as BTF strings section.
