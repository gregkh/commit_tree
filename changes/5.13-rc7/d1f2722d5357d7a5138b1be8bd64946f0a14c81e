docs: hwmon: tmp103.rst: fix bad usage of UTF-8 chars

While UTF-8 characters can be used at the Linux documentation,
the best is to use them only when ASCII doesn't offer a good replacement.
So, replace the occurences of the following UTF-8 characters:

	- U+2013 ('â€“'): EN DASH

In this specific case, EN DASH was used instead of a minus
sign. So, replace it by a single hyphen.
