bus: mhi: pci_generic: Introduce quectel EM1XXGR-L support

Add support for EM1XXGR-L modems, this modem series is based on SDX24
qcom chip. The modem is mainly based on MBIM protocol for both the
data and control path. The drivers for these channels (mhi-net-mbim and
mhi_uci) are not yet part of the kernel but will be integrated by
different series.
