vfio/mdev: Reorganize mdev_device_create()

Once the memory for the struct mdev_device is allocated it should
immediately be device_initialize()'d and filled in so that put_device()
can always be used to undo the allocation.

Place the mdev_get/put_parent() so that they are clearly protecting the
mdev->parent pointer. Move the final put to the release function so that
the lifetime rules are trivial to understand. Update the goto labels to
follow the normal convention.

Remove mdev_device_free() as the release function via device_put() is now
usable in all cases.
