powerpc/perf: Infrastructure to support checking of attr.config*

Introduce code to support the checking of attr.config* for
values which are reserved for a given platform.
Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) configuration registers
have fields that are reserved and some specific values for
bit fields are reserved. For ex., MMCRA[61:62] is
Random Sampling Mode (SM) and value of 0b11 for this field
is reserved.

Writing non-zero or invalid values in these fields will
have unknown behaviours.

Patch adds a generic call-back function "check_attr_config"
in "struct power_pmu", to be called in event_init to
check for attr.config* values for a given platform.
