KVM: VMX: Truncate GPR value for DR and CR reads in !64-bit mode

Drop bits 63:32 when storing a DR/CR to a GPR when the vCPU is not in
64-bit mode.  Per the SDM:

  The operand size for these instructions is always 32 bits in non-64-bit
  modes, regardless of the operand-size attribute.

CR8 technically isn't affected as CR8 isn't accessible outside of 64-bit
mode, but fix it up for consistency and to allow for future cleanup.
