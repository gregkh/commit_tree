ext4: add ability to return parsed options from parse_options

Before this patch, the function parse_options() was returning
journal_devnum and journal_ioprio variables to the caller. This patch
generalizes that interface to allow parse_options to return any parsed
options to return back to the caller. In this patch series, it gets
used to capture the value of "mb_optimize_scan=%u" mount option.
