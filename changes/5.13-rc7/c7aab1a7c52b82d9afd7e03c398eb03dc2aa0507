task_work: add helper for more targeted task_work canceling

The only exported helper we have right now is task_work_cancel(), which
cancels any task_work from a given task where func matches the queued
work item. This is a bit too coarse for some use cases. Add a
task_work_cancel_match() that allows to more specifically target
individual work items outside of purely the callback function used.

task_work_cancel() can be trivially implemented on top of that, hence do
so.
