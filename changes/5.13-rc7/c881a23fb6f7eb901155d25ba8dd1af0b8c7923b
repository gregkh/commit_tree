nvme: disallow passthru cmd from targeting a nsid != nsid of the block dev

When a passthru command targets a specific namespace, the ns parameter to
nvme_user_cmd()/nvme_user_cmd64() is set. However, there is currently no
validation that the nsid specified in the passthru command targets the
namespace/nsid represented by the block device that the ioctl was
performed on.

Add a check that validates that the nsid in the passthru command matches
that of the supplied namespace.
