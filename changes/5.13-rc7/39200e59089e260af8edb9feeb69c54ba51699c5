btrfs: validate root::reloc_root after recording root in trans

If we fail to setup a root->reloc_root in a different thread that path
will error out, however it still leaves root->reloc_root NULL but would
still appear set up in the transaction.  Subsequent calls to
btrfs_record_root_in_transaction would succeed without attempting to
create the reloc root, as the transid has already been updated.

Handle this case by making sure we have a root->reloc_root set after a
btrfs_record_root_in_transaction call so we don't end up dereferencing a
NULL pointer.
