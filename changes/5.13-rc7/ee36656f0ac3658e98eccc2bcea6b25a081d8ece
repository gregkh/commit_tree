KVM: VMX: Define Hyper-V paravirt TLB flush fields iff Hyper-V is enabled

Ifdef away the Hyper-V specific fields in structs kvm_vmx and vcpu_vmx
as each field has only a single reference outside of the struct itself
that isn't already wrapped in ifdeffery (and both are initialization).

vcpu_vmx.ept_pointer in particular should be wrapped as it is valid if
and only if Hyper-v is active, i.e. non-Hyper-V code cannot rely on it
to actually track the current EPTP (without additional code changes).
