selftests: mptcp: enable syncookie only in absence of reorders

Syncookie validation may fail for OoO packets, causing spurious
resets and self-tests failures, so let's force syncookie only
for tests iteration with no OoO.

Fixes: fed61c4b584c ("selftests: mptcp: make 2nd net namespace use tcp syn cookies unconditionally")
