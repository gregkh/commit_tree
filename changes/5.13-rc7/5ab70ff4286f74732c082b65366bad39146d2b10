kbuild: do not set -w for vmlinux.o modpost

The -w option is meaningless for the first pass of modpost (vmlinux.o).

We know there are unresolved symbols in vmlinux.o, hence we skip
check_exports() and other checks when mod->is_vmlinux is set.

See the following part in the for-loop.

    if (mod->is_vmlinux || mod->from_dump)
            continue;
