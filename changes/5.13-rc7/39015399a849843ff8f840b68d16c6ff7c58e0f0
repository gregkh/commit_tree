fs: turn some comments into kernel-doc

While reviewing ./include/linux/fs.h, I noticed that three comments can
actually be turned into kernel-doc comments. This allows to check the
consistency between the descriptions and the functions' signatures in
case they may change in the future.

A quick validation with the consistency check:

  ./scripts/kernel-doc -none include/linux/fs.h

currently reports no issues in this file.
