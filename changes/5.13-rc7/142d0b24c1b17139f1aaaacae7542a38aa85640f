usb: typec: mux: Fix copy-paste mistake in typec_mux_match

Fix the copy-paste mistake in the return path of typec_mux_match(),
where dev is considered a member of struct typec_switch rather than
struct typec_mux.

The two structs are identical in regards to having the struct device as
the first entry, so this provides no functional change.
