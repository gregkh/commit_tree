libperf xyarray: Add bounds checks to xyarray__entry()

xyarray__entry() is missing any bounds checking yet often the x and y
parameters come from external callers. Add bounds checks and an
unchecked __xyarray__entry().

Committer notes:

Make the 'x' and 'y' arguments to the new xyarray__entry() that does
bounds check to be of type 'size_t', so that we cover also the case
where 'x' and 'y' could be negative, which is needed anyway as having
them as 'int' breaks the build with:

  /home/acme/git/perf/tools/lib/perf/include/internal/xyarray.h: In function ‘xyarray__entry’:

     28 |  if (x >= xy->max_x || y >= xy->max_y)
