netfilter: allow to turn off xtables compat layer

The compat layer needs to parse untrusted input (the ruleset)
to translate it to a 64bit compatible format.

We had a number of bugs in this department in the past, so allow users
to turn this feature off.

Add CONFIG_NETFILTER_XTABLES_COMPAT kconfig knob and make it default to y
to keep existing behaviour.
