iio: make use of devm_iio_kfifo_buffer_setup() helper

All drivers that already call devm_iio_kfifo_allocate() &
iio_device_attach_buffer() are simple to convert to
iio_device_attach_kfifo_buffer() in a single go.

This change does that; the unwind order is preserved.
What is important, is that the devm_iio_kfifo_buffer_setup() be called
after the indio_dev->modes is assigned, to make sure that
INDIO_BUFFER_SOFTWARE flag is set and not overridden by the assignment to
indio_dev->modes.

Also, the INDIO_BUFFER_SOFTWARE has been removed from the assignments of
'indio_dev->modes' because it is set by devm_iio_kfifo_buffer_setup().
