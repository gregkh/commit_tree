ext4: add mballoc stats proc file

Add new stats for measuring the performance of mballoc. This patch is
forked from Artem Blagodarenko's work that can be found here:

https://github.com/lustre/lustre-release/blob/master/ldiskfs/kernel_patches/patches/rhel8/ext4-simple-blockalloc.patch

This patch reorganizes the stats by cr level. This is how the output
looks like:

	cr2_stats:
		hits: 0
		groups_considered: 0
		useless_loops: 0
	cr3_stats:

	extents_scanned: 0
