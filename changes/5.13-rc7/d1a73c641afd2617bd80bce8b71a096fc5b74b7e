drm/vmwgfx: Make sure we unpin no longer needed buffers

We were not correctly unpinning no longer needed buffers. In particular
vmw_buffer_object, which is internally often pinned on creation wasn't
unpinned on destruction and none of the internal MOB buffers were
unpinned before being put back. Technically this existed for a
long time but commit 57fcd550eb15 ("drm/ttm: Warn on pinning without
holding a reference") introduced a WARN_ON which was filling up the
kernel logs rather quickly.

Quite frankly internal usage of vmw_buffer_object and in general
pinning needs to be refactored in vmwgfx but for now this makes
it work.
