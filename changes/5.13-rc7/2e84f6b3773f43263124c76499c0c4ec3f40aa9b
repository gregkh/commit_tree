ice: parameterize functions responsible for Tx ring management

Commit ae15e0ba1b33 ("ice: Change number of XDP Tx queues to match
number of Rx queues") tried to address the incorrect setting of XDP
queue count that was based on the Tx queue count, whereas in theory we
should provide the XDP queue per Rx queue. However, the routines that
setup and destroy the set of Tx resources are still based on the
vsi->num_txq.

Ice supports the asynchronous Tx/Rx queue count, so for a setup where
vsi->num_txq > vsi->num_rxq, ice_vsi_stop_tx_rings and ice_vsi_cfg_txqs
will be accessing the vsi->xdp_rings out of the bounds.

Parameterize two mentioned functions so they get the size of Tx resources
array as the input.
