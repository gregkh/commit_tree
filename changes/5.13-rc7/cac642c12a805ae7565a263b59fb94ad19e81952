arm64: cpufeature: Allow early filtering of feature override

Some CPUs are broken enough that some overrides need to be rejected
at the earliest opportunity. In some cases, that's right at cpu
feature override time.

Provide the necessary infrastructure to filter out overrides,
and to report such filtered out overrides to the core cpufeature code.
