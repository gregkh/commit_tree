powerpc/32: Refactor booke critical registers saving

Refactor booke critical registers saving into a few macros
and move it into the exception prolog directly.

Keep the dedicated transfert_to_handler entry point for the
moment allthough they are empty. They will be removed in a
later patch to reduce churn.
