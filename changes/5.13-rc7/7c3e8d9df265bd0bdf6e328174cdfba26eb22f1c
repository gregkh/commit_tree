serial: 8250_exar: Avoid NULL pointer dereference at ->exit()

It's possible that during ->exit() the private_data is NULL,
for instance when there was no GPIO device instantiated.
Due to this we may not dereference it. Add a respective check.

Note, for now ->exit() only makes sense when GPIO device
was instantiated, that's why we may use the check for entire
function.
