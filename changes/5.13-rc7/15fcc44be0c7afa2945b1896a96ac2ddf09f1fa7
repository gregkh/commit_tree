vfio/mdev: Add mdev/mtype_get_type_group_id()

This returns the index in the supported_type_groups array that is
associated with the mdev_type attached to the struct mdev_device or its
containing struct kobject.

Each mdev_device can be spawned from exactly one mdev_type, which in turn
originates from exactly one supported_type_group.

Drivers are using weird string calculations to try and get back to this
index, providing a direct access to the index removes a bunch of wonky
driver code.

mdev_type->group can be deleted as the group is obtained using the
type_group_id.
