tracing: Define static void trace_print_time()

The part of the code that prints the time of the trace record in
"int trace_print_context()" gets extracted in a static function. This
is done as a preparation for a following patch, in which we will define
a new ftrace event called "func_repeats". The new static method,
defined here, will be used by this new event to print the time of the
last repeat of a function that is consecutively called number of times.
