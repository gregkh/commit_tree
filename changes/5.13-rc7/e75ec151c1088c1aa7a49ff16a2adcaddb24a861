gro: make net/gro.h self-contained

If some source file includes <net/gro.h>, but doesn't include
<linux/indirect_call_wrapper.h>:

In file included from net/8021q/vlan_core.c:7:
./include/net/gro.h:6:1: warning: data definition has no type or storage class
    6 | INDIRECT_CALLABLE_DECLARE(struct sk_buff *ipv6_gro_receive(struct list_head *,
      | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
./include/net/gro.h:6:1: error: type defaults to ‘int’ in declaration of ‘INDIRECT_CALLABLE_DECLARE’ [-Werror=implicit-int]

[...]

Include <linux/indirect_call_wrapper.h> directly. It's small and
won't pull lots of dependencies.
Also add some incomplete struct declarations to be fully stacked.

Fixes: 04f00ab2275f ("net/core: move gro function declarations to separate header ")
