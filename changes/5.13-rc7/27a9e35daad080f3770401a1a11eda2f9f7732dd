habanalabs: ignore f/w status error

In case firmware has a bug and erroneously reports a status error
(e.g. device unusable) during boot, allow the user to tell the driver
to continue the boot regardless of the error status.

This will be done via kernel parameter which exposes a mask. The
user that loads the driver can decide exactly which status error to
ignore and which to take into account. The bitmask is according to
defines in hl_boot_if.h
