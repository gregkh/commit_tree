KVM: x86/mmu: Rename and document A/D scheme for TDP SPTEs

Rename the various A/D status defines to explicitly associated them with
TDP.  There is a subtle dependency on the bits in question never being
set when using PAE paging, as those bits are reserved, not available.
I.e. using these bits outside of TDP (technically EPT) would cause
explosions.

No functional change intended.
