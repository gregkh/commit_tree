kselftest/arm64: mte: Fix compilation with native compiler

The mte selftest Makefile contains a check for GCC, to add the memtag
-march flag to the compiler options. This check fails if the compiler
is not explicitly specified, so reverts to the standard "cc", in which
case --version doesn't mention the "gcc" string we match against:
$ cc --version | head -n 1
cc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0

This will not add the -march switch to the command line, so compilation
fails:
mte_helper.S: Assembler messages:
mte_helper.S:25: Error: selected processor does not support `irg x0,x0,xzr'
mte_helper.S:38: Error: selected processor does not support `gmi x1,x0,xzr'
...

Actually clang accepts the same -march option as well, so we can just
drop this check and add this unconditionally to the command line, to avoid
any future issues with this check altogether (gcc actually prints
basename(argv[0]) when called with --version).
