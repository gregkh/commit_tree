mm/hugeltb: simplify the return code of __vma_reservation_common()

It's guaranteed that the vma is associated with a resv_map, i.e.  either
VM_MAYSHARE or HPAGE_RESV_OWNER, when the code reaches here or we would
have returned via !resv check above.  So it's unneeded to check whether
HPAGE_RESV_OWNER is set here.  Simplify the return code to make it more
clear.
