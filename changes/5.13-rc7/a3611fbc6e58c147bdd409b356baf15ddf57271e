selftests/resctrl: Check for resctrl mount point only if resctrl FS is supported

check_resctrlfs_support() does the following
1. Checks if the platform supports resctrl file system or not by looking
   for resctrl in /proc/filesystems
2. Calls opendir() on default resctrl file system path
   (i.e. /sys/fs/resctrl)
3. Checks if resctrl file system is mounted or not by looking at
   /proc/mounts

Steps 2 and 3 will fail if the platform does not support resctrl file
system. So, there is no need to check for them if step 1 fails.

Fix this by returning immediately if the platform does not support
resctrl file system.
