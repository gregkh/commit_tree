ARM: 9075/1: kernel: Fix interrupted SMC calls

On Qualcomm ARM32 platforms, the SMC call can return before it has
completed. If this occurs, the call can be restarted, but it requires
using the returned session ID value from the interrupted SMC call.

The ARM32 SMCC code already has the provision to add platform specific
quirks for things like this. So let's make use of it and add the
Qualcomm specific quirk (ARM_SMCCC_QUIRK_QCOM_A6) used by the QCOM_SCM
driver.

This change is similar to the below one added for ARM64 a while ago:
commit 82bcd087029f ("firmware: qcom: scm: Fix interrupted SCM calls")

Without this change, the Qualcomm ARM32 platforms like SDX55 will return
-EINVAL for SMC calls used for modem firmware loading and validation.
