mlxsw: spectrum_router: Pass payload pointer to nexthop update function

Have the caller pass a pointer to the payload of the RATR register to
the function updating a single nexthop / adjacency entry.

In a subsequent patch, this will allow the caller to make sure
replacement was successful by querying the state of the adjacency entry
after replacement and comparing with the initial request.
