drm/amd/display: Report Proper Quantization Range in AVI Infoframe

[Why?]
When a monitor does not set both QS and QY bits, DC does not
set Q0, Q1, QY0 and QY1 bits in AVI infoframe. Setting RGB bits
should be separate from setting YCC bits.

[How?]
Separate logic for setting RGB and YCC quantization range bits
in the AVI infoframe.
