PCI: thunder: Fix compile testing

Compile-testing these drivers is currently broken. Enabling it causes a
couple of build failures though:

  drivers/pci/controller/pci-thunder-ecam.c:119:30: error: shift count >= width of type [-Werror,-Wshift-count-overflow]
  drivers/pci/controller/pci-thunder-pem.c:54:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'writeq' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  drivers/pci/controller/pci-thunder-pem.c:392:8: error: implicit declaration of function 'acpi_get_rc_resources' [-Werror,-Wimplicit-function-declaration]

Fix them with the obvious one-line changes.
