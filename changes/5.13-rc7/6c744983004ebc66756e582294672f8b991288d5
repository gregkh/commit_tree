drm/bridge: anx7625: disable regulators when power off

When suspending the driver, anx7625_power_standby() will be called to
turn off reset-gpios and enable-gpios. However, power supplies are not
disabled. To save power, the driver can get the power supply regulators
and turn off them in anx7625_power_standby().
