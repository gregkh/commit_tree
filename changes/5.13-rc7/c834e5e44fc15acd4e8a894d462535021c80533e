KVM: x86/mmu: Use '0' as the one and only value for an invalid PAE root

Use '0' to denote an invalid pae_root instead of '0' or INVALID_PAGE.
Unlike root_hpa, the pae_roots hold permission bits and thus are
guaranteed to be non-zero.  Having to deal with both values leads to
bugs, e.g. failing to set back to INVALID_PAGE, warning on the wrong
value, etc...
