usb: core: hub: Disable autosuspend for Cypress CY7C65632

The Cypress CY7C65632 appears to have an issue with auto suspend and
detecting devices, not too dissimilar to the SMSC 5534B hub. It is
easiest to reproduce by connecting multiple mass storage devices to
the hub at the same time. On a Lenovo Yoga, around 1 in 3 attempts
result in the devices not being detected. It is however possible to
make them appear using lsusb -v.

Disabling autosuspend for this hub resolves the issue.
