tpm: vtpm_proxy: Avoid reading host log when using a virtual device

Avoid allocating memory and reading the host log when a virtual device
is used since this log is of no use to that driver. A virtual
device can be identified through the flag TPM_CHIP_FLAG_VIRTUAL, which
is only set for the tpm_vtpm_proxy driver.
