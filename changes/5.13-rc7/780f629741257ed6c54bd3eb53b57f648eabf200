i2c: omap: fix reference leak when pm_runtime_get_sync fails

The PM reference count is not expected to be incremented on
return in omap_i2c_probe() and omap_i2c_remove().

However, pm_runtime_get_sync will increment the PM reference
count even failed. Forgetting to putting operation will result
in a reference leak here. I Replace it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get
to keep usage counter balanced.

What's more, error path 'err_free_mem' seems not like a proper
name any more. So I change the name to err_disable_pm and move
pm_runtime_disable below, for pm_runtime of 'pdev->dev' should
be disabled when pm_runtime_resume_and_get fails.
