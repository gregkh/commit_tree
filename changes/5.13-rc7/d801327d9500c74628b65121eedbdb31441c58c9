ceph: convert ceph_write_begin to netfs_write_begin

Convert ceph_write_begin to use the netfs_write_begin helper. Most of
the ops we need for it are already in place from the readpage conversion
but we do add a new check_write_begin op since ceph needs to be able to
vet whether there is an incompatible writeback already in flight before
reading in the page.

With this, we can also remove the old ceph_do_readpage helper.
