ASoC: SOF: reset enabled_cores state at suspend

The recent changes to use common code to power up/down DSP cores also
removed the reset of the core state at suspend. It turns out this is
still needed. When the firmware state is reset to
SOF_FW_BOOT_NOT_STARTED, also enabled_cores should be reset, and
existing DSP drivers depend on this.
