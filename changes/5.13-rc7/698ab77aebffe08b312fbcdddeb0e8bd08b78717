dax: Add an enum for specifying dax wakup mode

Dan mentioned that he is not very fond of passing around a boolean true/false
to specify if only next waiter should be woken up or all waiters should be
woken up. He instead prefers that we introduce an enum and make it very
explicity at the callsite itself. Easier to read code.

This patch should not introduce any change of behavior.
