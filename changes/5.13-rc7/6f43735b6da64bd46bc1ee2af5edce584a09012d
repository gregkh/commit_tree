dt-bindings: net: renesas,etheravb: Add additional clocks

The AVB driver assumes there is an external crystal, but it could
be clocked by other means.  In order to enable a programmable
clock, it needs to be added to the clocks list and enabled in the
driver.  Since there currently only one clock, there is no
clock-names list either.

Update bindings to add the additional optional clock, and explicitly
name both of them.
