kbuild: Add generic rule to apply fdtoverlay

Add a generic rule to apply fdtoverlay in Makefile.lib, so every
platform doesn't need to carry the complex rule. This also automatically
adds "DTC_FLAGS_foo_base += -@" for all base files.

The platform's Makefile only needs to have this now:

 foo-dtbs := foo_base.dtb foo_overlay1.dtbo foo_overlay2.dtbo
 dtb-y := foo.dtb

We don't want to run schema checks on foo.dtb (as foo.dts doesn't exist)
and the Makefile is updated accordingly.
