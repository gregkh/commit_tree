sched/pelt: Ensure that *_sum is always synced with *_avg

Rounding in PELT calculation happening when entities are attached/detached
of a cfs_rq can result into situations where util/runnable_avg is not null
but util/runnable_sum is. This is normally not possible so we need to
ensure that util/runnable_sum stays synced with util/runnable_avg.

detach_entity_load_avg() is the last place where we don't sync
util/runnable_sum with util/runnbale_avg when moving some sched_entities
