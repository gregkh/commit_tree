selftests/bpf: Omit skeleton generation for multi-linked BPF object files

Skip generating individual BPF skeletons for files that are supposed to be
linked together to form the final BPF object file. Very often such files are
"incomplete" BPF object files, which will fail libbpf bpf_object__open() step,
if used individually, thus failing BPF skeleton generation. This is by design,
so skip individual BPF skeletons and only validate them as part of their
linked final BPF object file and skeleton.
