kernel.h: drop inclusion in bitmap.h

The bitmap.h header is used in a lot of code around the kernel.  Besides
that it includes kernel.h which sometimes makes a loop.

The problem here is many unneeded loops that make header hell
dependencies.  For example, how may you move bitmap_zalloc() from C-file
to the header?  Currently it's impossible.  And bitmap.h here is only the
tip of an iceberg.

kerne.h is a dump of everything that even has nothing in common at all.
We may still have it, but in my new code I prefer to include only the
headers that I want to use, without the bulk of unneeded kernel code.

Break the loop by introducing align.h, including it in kernel.h and
bitmap.h followed by replacing kernel.h with limits.h.
