cpufreq: armada-37xx: Fix determining base CPU frequency

When current CPU load is not L0 then loading armada-37xx-cpufreq.ko driver
fails with following error:

    # modprobe armada-37xx-cpufreq
    [  502.702097] Unsupported CPU frequency 250 MHz

This issue was partially fixed by commit 8db82563451f ("cpufreq:
armada-37xx: fix frequency calculation for opp"), but only for calculating
CPU frequency for opp.

Fix this also for determination of base CPU frequency.
