arm64: Relax booting requirements for configuration of traps

Currently we require that a number of system registers be configured to
disable traps when starting the kernel. Add an explicit note that the
requirement is that the system behave as if the traps are disabled so
transparent handling of the traps is fine, this should be implicit for
people familiar with working with standards documents but it doesn't hurt
to be explicit.
