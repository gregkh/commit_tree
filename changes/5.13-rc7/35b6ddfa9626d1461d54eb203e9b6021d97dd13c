btrfs: introduce write_one_subpage_eb() function

The new function, write_one_subpage_eb(), as a subroutine for subpage
metadata write, will handle the extent buffer bio submission.

The major differences between the new write_one_subpage_eb() and
write_one_eb() is:

- No page locking
  When entering write_one_subpage_eb() the page is no longer locked.
  We only lock the page for its status update, and unlock immediately.
  Now we completely rely on extent io tree locking.

- Extra bitmap update along with page status update
  Now page dirty and writeback is controlled by
  btrfs_subpage::dirty_bitmap and btrfs_subpage::writeback_bitmap.
  They both follow the schema that any sector is dirty/writeback, then
  the full page gets dirty/writeback.

- When to update the nr_written number
  Now we take a shortcut, if we have cleared the last dirty bit of the
  page, we update nr_written.
  This is not completely perfect, but should emulate the old behavior
  well enough.
