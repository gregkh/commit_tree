net: stmmac: disable clocks in stmmac_remove_config_dt()

Platform drivers may call stmmac_probe_config_dt() to parse dt, could
call stmmac_remove_config_dt() in error handing after dt parsed, so need
disable clocks in stmmac_remove_config_dt().

Go through all platforms drivers which use stmmac_probe_config_dt(),
none of them disable clocks manually, so it's safe to disable them in
stmmac_remove_config_dt().
