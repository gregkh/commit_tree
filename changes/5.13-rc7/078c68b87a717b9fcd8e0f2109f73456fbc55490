scsi: lpfc: Fix rmmod crash due to bad ring pointers to abort_iotag

Rmmod on SLI-4 adapters is sometimes hitting a bad ptr dereference in
lpfc_els_free_iocb().

A prior patch refactored the lpfc_sli_abort_iocb() routine. One of the
changes was to convert from building/sending an abort within the routine to
using a common routine. The reworked routine passes, without modification,
the pring ptr to the new common routine. The older routine had logic to
check SLI-3 vs SLI-4 and adapt the pring ptr if necessary as callers were
passing SLI-3 pointers even when not on an SLI-4 adapter. The new routine
is missing this check and adapt, so the SLI-3 ring pointers are being used
in SLI-4 paths.

Fix by cleaning up the calling routines. In review, there is no need to
pass the ring ptr argument to abort_iocb at all. The routine can look at
the adapter type itself and reference the proper ring.
