mac80211: move interface shutdown out of wiphy lock

When reconfiguration fails, we shut down everything, but we
cannot call cfg80211_shutdown_all_interfaces() with the wiphy
mutex held. Since cfg80211 now calls it on resume errors, we
only need to do likewise for where we call reconfig (whether
directly or indirectly), but not under the wiphy lock.
