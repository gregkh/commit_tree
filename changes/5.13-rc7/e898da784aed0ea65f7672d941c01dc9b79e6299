KVM: LAPIC: Write 0 to TMICT should also cancel vmx-preemption timer

According to the SDM 10.5.4.1:

  A write of 0 to the initial-count register effectively stops the local
  APIC timer, in both one-shot and periodic mode.

However, the lapic timer oneshot/periodic mode which is emulated by vmx-preemption
timer doesn't stop by writing 0 to TMICT since vmx->hv_deadline_tsc is still
programmed and the guest will receive the spurious timer interrupt later. This
patch fixes it by also cancelling the vmx-preemption timer when writing 0 to
the initial-count register.
