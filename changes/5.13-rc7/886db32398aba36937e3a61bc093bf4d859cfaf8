powerpc/kexec_file: Restore FDT size estimation for kdump kernel

kexec_fdt_totalsize_ppc64() includes the base FDT size in its size
calculation, but commit 3c985d31ad66 ("powerpc: Use common
of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt()") changed the kexec code to use the
generic function of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt() which already includes
the base FDT size. That change made the code overestimate the size a bit
by counting twice the space required for the kernel command line and
/chosen properties.

Therefore change kexec_fdt_totalsize_ppc64() to calculate just the extra
space needed by the kdump kernel, and change the function name so that it
better reflects what the function is now doing.
