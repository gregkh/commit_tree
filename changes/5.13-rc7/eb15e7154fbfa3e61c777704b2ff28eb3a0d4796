dmaengine: idxd: add interrupt handle request and release support

DSA spec states that when Request Interrupt Handle and Release Interrupt
Handle command bits are set in the CMDCAP register, these device commands
must be supported by the driver.

The interrupt handle is programmed in a descriptor. When Request Interrupt
Handle is not supported, the interrupt handle is the index of the desired
entry in the MSI-X table. When the command is supported, driver must use
the command to obtain a handle to be programmed in the submitted
descriptor.

A requested handle may be revoked. After the handle is revoked, any use of
the handle will result in Invalid Interrupt Handle error.
