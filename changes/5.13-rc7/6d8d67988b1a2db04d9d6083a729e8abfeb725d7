pinctrl: qcom: sc8180x: add ACPI probe support

It adds ACPI probe support for pinctrl-sc8180x driver.  We have one
problem with ACPI table, i.e. GIO0 (TLMM) block has one single memory
resource to cover 3 tiles defined by SC8180X.  To follow the hardware
layout of 3 tiles which is already supported DT probe, it adds one
function to replace the original single memory resource with 3 named
ones for tiles.  With that, We can map memory for ACPI in the same way
as DT.
