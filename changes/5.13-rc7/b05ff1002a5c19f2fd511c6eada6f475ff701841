HID: Add support for Surface Aggregator Module HID transport

Add a HID transport driver to support integrated HID devices on newer
Microsoft Surface models (specifically 7th-generation, i.e. Surface
Laptop 3, Surface Book 3, and later).

On those models, the internal keyboard and touchpad (as well as some
other HID devices with currently unknown function) are connected via the
generic HID subsystem (TC=0x15) of the Surface System Aggregator Module
(SSAM). This subsystem provides a generic HID transport layer, support
for which is implemented by this driver.
