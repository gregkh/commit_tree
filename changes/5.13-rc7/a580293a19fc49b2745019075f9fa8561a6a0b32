mtd: spi-nor: Get rid of duplicated argument in spi_nor_parse_sfdp()

spi_nor_parse_sfdp(nor, nor->params);
passes for the second argument a member within the first argument.
Drop the second argument and obtain it directly from the first,
and do it across all the children functions. This is a follow up for
'commit 69a8eed58cc0 ("mtd: spi-nor: Don't copy self-pointing struct around")'
