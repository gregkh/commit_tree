scsi: lpfc: Fix pt2pt connection does not recover after LOGO

On a pt2pt setup, between 2 initiators, if one side issues a a LOGO, there
is no relogin attempt. The FC specs are grey in this area on which port
(higher wwn or not) is to re-login.

As there is no spec guidance, unconditionally re-PLOGI after the logout to
ensure a login is re-established.
