ASoC: soc-pcm: ignore dummy-DAI at soc_pcm_params_symmetry()

soc_pcm_params_symmetry() checks CPU / Codec symmetry.
Unfortunately there was bug on it (= A) which didn't check Codec.
But is back by (B).

	A: v5.7:  commit c840f7698d26 ("ASoC: soc-pcm: Merge for_each_rtd_cpu/codec_dais()")
	B: v5.12: commit 3a9067211122 ("ASoC: soc-pcm: cleanup soc_pcm_params_symmetry()")

In total,
old - v5.6 (= Generation-1):

	symmetric_rate		: DAI_Link / CPU / Codec
	symmetric_channels	: DAI_Link / CPU / Codec
	symmetric_sample_bits	: DAI_Link / CPU / Codec

v5.7 - v5.11 (= Generation-2): (= because of bug by (A))

	symmetric_rate		: DAI_Link / CPU
	symmetric_channels	: DAI_Link / CPU / Codec
	symmetric_sample_bits	: DAI_Link / CPU / Codec

v5.12 - (= Generation-3): (= back by (B))

	symmetric_rate		: DAI_Link / CPU / Codec
	symmetric_channels	: DAI_Link / CPU / Codec
	symmetric_sample_bits	: DAI_Link / CPU / Codec

OTOH, we can use DPCM which is configured by FE / BE.
Both FE / BE uses dummy-DAI.

	FE: CPU       <-> dummy-DAI
	BE: dummy-DAI <-> Codec

One note is that we can use .be_hw_params_fixup in DPCM case.
This means BE settings might be fixuped/updated by FE.
This feature is used for example on MIXer case.
It can be happen not only for rate, but for channels/sample_bits too.

Because of these reasons, below issue happen on
Generation-1 / Generation-3, if...

	1) Sound Card used DPCM
	2) It exchanges rate to 48kHz by using .be_hw_params_fixup()
	3) Codec had symmetric_rate = 1

I didn't confirm, but maybe same things happen
if it exchanged channels/sample_bits at Generation-1/2/3 too.

soc_pcm_params_symmetry() checks by below

	if (symmetry)
		for_each_rtd_cpu_dais(rtd, i, cpu_dai)
			if (cpu_dai->xxx && cpu_dai->xxx != d.xxx) {
				dev_err(rtd->dev, "...");
				return -EINVAL;
			}

Because of above reason 3) (= Codec had symmetric_rate = 1)
BE can't ignore "if (symmetric)".

At 1st aplay, soc_pcm_params_symmetry() ignores it,
because dummy-DAI->rate is 0.
After this check, each DAI sets/keep settings.

In above sample case, BE gets 48000 and FE gets 44100,
and it happen BE -> FE order.
Because DPCM is sharing *same* dummy-DAI,
dummy-DAI sets as 48000 by BE, and is overwrote by 44100 by FE.

This settings never be cleaned (= a) after 1st aplay,
because dummy-DAI is used from FE/BE, never be last user (b).

	static int soc_pcm_hw_clean(...)
	{
		...
		for_each_rtd_dais(rtd, i, dai) {
			...
(b)			if (snd_soc_dai_active(dai) == 1)
(a)				soc_pcm_set_dai_params(dai, NULL);
			...
		}
		...
	}

At 2nd aplay, BE gets 48000 but dummy-DAI is keeping 44100,
soc_pcm_params_symmetry() checks will fail.

To solve this issue, this patch ignores dummy-DAI
at soc_pcm_params_symmetry()
