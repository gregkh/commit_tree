x86/msr: Fix wr/rdmsr_safe_regs_on_cpu() prototypes

gcc-11 warns about mismatched prototypes here:

  arch/x86/lib/msr-smp.c:255:51: error: argument 2 of type ‘u32 *’ {aka ‘unsigned int *’} declared as a pointer [-Werror=array-parameter=]
    255 | int rdmsr_safe_regs_on_cpu(unsigned int cpu, u32 *regs)
        |                                              ~~~~~^~~~
  arch/x86/include/asm/msr.h:347:50: note: previously declared as an array ‘u32[8]’ {aka ‘unsigned int[8]’}

GCC is right here - fix up the types.
