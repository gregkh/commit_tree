PCI: dwc: Move dw_pcie_msi_init() to dw_pcie_setup_rc()

If the host which makes use of IP's integrated MSI Receiver losts
power during suspend, we need to reinit the RC and MSI Receiver in
resume. But after we move dw_pcie_msi_init() into the core, we have no
API to do so. Usually the dwc users need to call dw_pcie_setup_rc() to
reinit the RC, we can solve this problem by moving dw_pcie_msi_init()
to dw_pcie_setup_rc().
