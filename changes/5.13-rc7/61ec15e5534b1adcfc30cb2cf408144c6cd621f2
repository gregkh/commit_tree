thunderbolt: Disable retry logic for intra-domain control packets

In most cases the response packet is lost because the router in question
was disconnected by the user. Resending the control packet in that case
just adds unnecessary delays, so disable that for intra-domain control
packets. For inter-domain (XDomain) packets we continue retrying.

This also aligns the driver better what the Intel connection manager
firmware is doing.
