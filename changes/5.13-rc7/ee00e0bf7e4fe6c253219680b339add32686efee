ASoC: wm8524: Do not print probe defer error

On an imx8mq-evk the following error is seen:

[    1.375809] wm8524-codec audio-codec: Failed to get mute line: -517

It happens because the codec driver may probe prior to the imx gpio
driver, which causes a probe defer.

Change to dev_err_probe() to avoid printing this error.
