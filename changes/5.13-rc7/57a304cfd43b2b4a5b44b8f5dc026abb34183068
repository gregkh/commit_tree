btrfs: do not panic in __add_reloc_root

If we have a duplicate entry for a reloc root then we could have fs
corruption that resulted in a double allocation.  Since this shouldn't
happen unless there is corruption, add an ASSERT(ret != -EEXIST) to all
of the callers of __add_reloc_root() to catch any logic mistakes for
developers, otherwise normal error handling will happen for normal
users.
