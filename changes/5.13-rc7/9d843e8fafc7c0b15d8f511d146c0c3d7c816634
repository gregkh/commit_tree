pstore: Add mem_type property DT parsing support

There could be a scenario where we define some region
in normal memory and use them store to logs which is later
retrieved by bootloader during warm reset.

In this scenario, we wanted to treat this memory as normal
cacheable memory instead of default behaviour which
is an overhead. Making it cacheable could improve
performance.

This commit gives control to change mem_type from Device
tree, and also documents the value for normal memory.
