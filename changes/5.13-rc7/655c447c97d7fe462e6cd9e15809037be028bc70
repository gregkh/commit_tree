iommu/arm-smmu-v3: add bit field SFM into GERROR_ERR_MASK

In arm_smmu_gerror_handler(), the value of the SMMU_GERROR register is
filtered by GERROR_ERR_MASK. However, the GERROR_ERR_MASK does not contain
the SFM bit. As a result, the subsequent error processing is not performed
when only the SFM error occurs.
