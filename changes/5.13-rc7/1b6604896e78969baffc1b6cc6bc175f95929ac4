ALSA: dice: fix stream format at middle sampling rate for Alesis iO 26

Alesis iO 26 FireWire has two pairs of digital optical interface. It
delivers PCM frames from the interfaces by second isochronous packet
streaming. Although both of the interfaces are available at 44.1/48.0
kHz, first one of them is only available at 88.2/96.0 kHz. It reduces
the number of PCM samples to 4 in Multi Bit Linear Audio data channel
of data blocks on the second isochronous packet streaming.

This commit fixes hardcoded stream formats.
