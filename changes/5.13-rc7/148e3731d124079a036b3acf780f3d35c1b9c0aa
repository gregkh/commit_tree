kvfree_rcu: Directly allocate page for single-argument case

Single-argument kvfree_rcu() must be invoked from sleepable contexts,
so we can directly allocate pages.  Furthermmore, the fallback in case
of page-allocation failure is the high-latency synchronize_rcu(), so it
makes sense to do these page allocations from the fastpath, and even to
permit limited sleeping within the allocator.

This commit therefore allocates if needed on the fastpath using
GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL.  This also has the beneficial effect
of leaving kvfree_rcu()'s per-CPU caches to the double-argument variant
of kvfree_rcu(), given that the double-argument variant cannot directly
invoke the allocator.
