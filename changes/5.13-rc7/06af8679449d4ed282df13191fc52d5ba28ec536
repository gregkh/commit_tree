coredump: Limit what can interrupt coredumps

Olivier Langlois has been struggling with coredumps being incompletely written in
processes using io_uring.

The coredump code deliberately supports being interrupted by SIGKILL,
and depends upon prepare_signal to filter out all other signals.   Now
that signal_pending includes wake ups for TIF_NOTIFY_SIGNAL this hack
in dump_emitted by the coredump code no longer works.

Make the coredump code more robust by explicitly testing for all of
the wakeup conditions the coredump code supports.  This prevents
new wakeup conditions from breaking the coredump code, as well
as fixing the current issue.

The filesystem code that the coredump code uses already limits
itself to only aborting on fatal_signal_pending.  So it should
not develop surprising wake-up reasons either.

v2: Don't remove the now unnecessary code in prepare_signal.
