lib/vdso: Add vdso_data pointer as input to __arch_get_timens_vdso_data()

For the same reason as commit e876f0b69dc9 ("lib/vdso: Allow
architectures to provide the vdso data pointer"), powerpc wants to
avoid calculation of relative position to code.

As the timens_vdso_data is next page to vdso_data, provide
vdso_data pointer to __arch_get_timens_vdso_data() in order
to ease the calculation on powerpc in following patches.
