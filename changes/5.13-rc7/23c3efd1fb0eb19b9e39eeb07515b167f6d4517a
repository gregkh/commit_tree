habanalabs: fail reset if device is not idle

After any reset (soft or hard) the device (the engines/QMANs) should
be idle. If they are not idle, fail the reset. If it is soft-reset,
the driver will try to do hard-reset automatically. If it is hard-reset,
the driver will make the device non-operational.
