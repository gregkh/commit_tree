net: qed: Fix memcpy() overflow of qed_dcbx_params()

The source (&dcbx_info->operational.params) and dest
(&p_hwfn->p_dcbx_info->set.config.params) are both struct qed_dcbx_params
(560 bytes), not struct qed_dcbx_admin_params (564 bytes), which is used
as the memcpy() size.

However it seems that struct qed_dcbx_operational_params
(dcbx_info->operational)'s layout matches struct qed_dcbx_admin_params
(p_hwfn->p_dcbx_info->set.config)'s 4 byte difference (3 padding, 1 byte
for "valid").

On the assumption that the size is wrong (rather than the source structure
type), adjust the memcpy() size argument to be 4 bytes smaller and add
a BUILD_BUG_ON() to validate any changes to the structure sizes.
