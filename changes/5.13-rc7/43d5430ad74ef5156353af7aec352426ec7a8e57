objtool: Keep track of retpoline call sites

Provide infrastructure for architectures to rewrite/augment compiler
generated retpoline calls. Similar to what we do for static_call()s,
keep track of the instructions that are retpoline calls.

Use the same list_head, since a retpoline call cannot also be a
static_call.
