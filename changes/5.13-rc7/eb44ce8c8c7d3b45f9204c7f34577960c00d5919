scsi: target: core: Add workqueue based cmd submission

loop and vhost/scsi do their target cmd submission from driver
workqueues. This allows them to avoid an issue where the backend may block
waiting for resources like tags/requests, mem/locks, etc and that ends up
blocking their entire submission path and for the case of vhost-scsi both
the submission and completion path.

This patch adds a helper drivers can use to submit from a LIO workqueue.
This code will then be extended in the next patches to fix the plugging of
backend devices.

We are only converting vhost/loop initially, but the workqueue based
submission will work for other drivers and have similar benefits where the
main target loops will not end up blocking one some backend resource.
