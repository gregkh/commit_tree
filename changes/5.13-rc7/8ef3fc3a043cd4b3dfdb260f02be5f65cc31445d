block, bfq: make shared queues inherit wakers

Consider a bfq_queue bfqq that is about to be merged with another
bfq_queue new_bfqq. The processes associated with bfqq are cooperators
of the processes associated with new_bfqq. So, if bfqq has a waker,
then it is reasonable (and beneficial for throughput) to assume that
all these processes will be happy to let bfqq's waker freely inject
I/O when they have no I/O. So this commit makes new_bfqq inherit
bfqq's waker.
