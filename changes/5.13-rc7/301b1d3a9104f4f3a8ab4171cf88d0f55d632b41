tools/power/turbostat: Fix turbostat for AMD Zen CPUs

It was reported that on Zen+ system turbostat started exiting,
which was tracked down to the MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STAT read failing because
offset_to_idx wasn't returning a non-negative index.

This patch combined the modification from Bingsong Si and
Bas Nieuwenhuizen and addd the MSR to the index system as alternative for
MSR_PKG_ENERGY_STATUS.
