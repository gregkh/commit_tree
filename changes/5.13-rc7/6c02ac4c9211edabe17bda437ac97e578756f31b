vfio-ccw: Reset FSM state to IDLE inside FSM

When an I/O request is made, the fsm_io_request() routine
moves the FSM state from IDLE to CP_PROCESSING, and then
fsm_io_helper() moves it to CP_PENDING if the START SUBCHANNEL
received a cc0. Yet, the error case to go from CP_PROCESSING
back to IDLE is done after the FSM call returns.

Let's move this up into the FSM proper, to provide some
better symmetry when unwinding in this case.
