mm/thp: fix page_address_in_vma() on file THP tails

Anon THP tails were already supported, but memory-failure may need to
use page_address_in_vma() on file THP tails, which its page->mapping
check did not permit: fix it.

hughd adds: no current usage is known to hit the issue, but this does
fix a subtle trap in a general helper: best fixed in stable sooner than
later.
