usb: xhci-mtk: fix oops when unbind driver

The oops happens when unbind driver through sysfs as following,
because xhci_mtk_drop_ep() try to drop the endpoint of root hub
which is not added by xhci_add_endpoint() and the virtual device
is not allocated, in fact also needn't drop it, so should skip it.
