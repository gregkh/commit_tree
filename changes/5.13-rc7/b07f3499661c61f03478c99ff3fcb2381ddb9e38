arm64: stacktrace: Move start_backtrace() out of the header

Currently start_backtrace() is a static inline function in the header.
Since it really shouldn't be sufficiently performance critical that we
actually need to have it inlined move it into a C file, this will save
anyone else scratching their head about why it is defined in the header.
As far as I can see it's only there because it was factored out of the
various callers.
