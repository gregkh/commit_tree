powerpc: Free fdt on error in elf64_load()

There are a few "goto out;" statements before the local variable "fdt"
is initialized through the call to of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt() in
elf64_load().  This will result in an uninitialized "fdt" being passed
to kvfree() in this function if there is an error before the call to
of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt().

If there is any error after fdt is allocated, but before it is
saved in the arch specific kimage struct, free the fdt.

Fixes: 3c985d31ad66 ("powerpc: Use common of_kexec_alloc_and_setup_fdt()")
