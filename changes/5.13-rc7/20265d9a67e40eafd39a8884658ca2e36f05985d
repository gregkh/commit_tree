gfs2: fix scheduling while atomic bug in glocks

Before this patch, in the unlikely event that gfs2_glock_dq encountered
a withdraw, it would do a wait_on_bit to wait for its journal to be
recovered, but it never released the glock's spin_lock, which caused a
scheduling-while-atomic error.

This patch unlocks the lockref spin_lock before waiting for recovery.
