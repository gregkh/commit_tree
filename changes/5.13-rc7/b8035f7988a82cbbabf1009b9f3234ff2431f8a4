media: Add parsing for APP14 data segment in jpeg helpers

According to Rec. ITU-T T.872 (06/2012) 6.5.3
APP14 segment is for color encoding, it contains a transform flag, which
may have values of 0, 1 and 2 and are interpreted as follows:
0 - CMYK for images that are encoded with four components
  - RGB for images that are encoded with three components
1 - An image encoded with three components using YCbCr colour encoding.
2 - An image encoded with four components using YCCK colour encoding.

This is used in imx-jpeg decoder, to distinguish between
YUV444 and RGB24.
