locking/locktorture: Pass thread id to lock/unlock functions

To allow the lock and unlock functions in locktorture to access
per-thread information, we need to pass some hint on how to locate
those information. One way to do this is to pass in a unique thread
id which can then be used to access a global array for thread specific
information.

Change the lock and unlock method to add a thread id parameter which
can be determined by the offset of the lwsp/lrsp pointer from the global
lwsa/lrsa array.

There is no other functional change in this patch.
