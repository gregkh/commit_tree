mfd: stmpe: Revert "Constify static struct resource"

In stmpe_devices_init(), the start and end field of these structs are
modified, so they can not be const. Add a comment to those structs that
lacked it to reduce the risk that this happens again.

This reverts commit 8d7b3a6dac4eae22c58b0853696cbd256966741b.
