perf pmu: Save detected hybrid pmus to a global pmu list

We identify the cpu_core pmu and cpu_atom pmu by explicitly
checking following files:

For cpu_core, checks:
"/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu_core/cpus"

For cpu_atom, checks:
"/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu_atom/cpus"

If the 'cpus' file exists and it has data, the pmu exists.

But in order not to hardcode the "cpu_core" and "cpu_atom",
and make the code in a generic way.

So if the path "/sys/bus/event_source/devices/cpu_xxx/cpus" exists, the
hybrid pmu exists. All the detected hybrid pmus are linked to a global
list 'perf_pmu__hybrid_pmus' and then next we just need to iterate the
list to get all hybrid pmu by using perf_pmu__for_each_hybrid_pmu.
