KVM: X86: Bail out of direct yield in case of under-committed scenarios

In case of under-committed scenarios, vCPUs can be scheduled easily;
kvm_vcpu_yield_to adds extra overhead, and it is also common to see
when vcpu->ready is true but yield later failing due to p->state is
TASK_RUNNING.

Let's bail out in such scenarios by checking the length of current cpu
runqueue, which can be treated as a hint of under-committed instead of
guarantee of accuracy. 30%+ of directed-yield attempts can now avoid
the expensive lookups in kvm_sched_yield() in an under-committed scenario.
