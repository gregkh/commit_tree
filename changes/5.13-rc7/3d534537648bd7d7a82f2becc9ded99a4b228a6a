ASoC: rt5670: Add a rt5670_components() helper

The rt5670 codec driver uses DMI quirks to configure the DMIC data-pins,
which means that it knows which DMIC interface is used on a specific
device.

ATM we duplicate this DMI matching inside the UCM profiles to select
the right DMIC interface. Add a rt5670_components() helper which the
machine-driver can use to set the components string of the card so
that UCM can get the info from the components string.

This way we only need to add new DMI quirks in one place.
