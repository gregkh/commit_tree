perf metricgroup: Fix find_evsel_group() event selector

The following command segfaults on my x86 broadwell:

  $ ./perf stat  -M frontend_bound,retiring,backend_bound,bad_speculation sleep 1
  WARNING: grouped events cpus do not match, disabling group:
    anon group { raw 0x10e }
    anon group { raw 0x10e }
  perf: util/evsel.c:1596: get_group_fd: Assertion `!(!leader->core.fd)' failed.
  Aborted (core dumped)

The issue shows itself as a use-after-free in evlist__check_cpu_maps(),
whereby the leader of an event selector (evsel) has been deleted (yet we
still attempt to verify for an evsel).

Fundamentally the problem comes from metricgroup__setup_events() ->
find_evsel_group(), and has developed from the previous fix attempt in
commit 9c880c24cb0d ("perf metricgroup: Fix for metrics containing
duration_time").

The problem now is that the logic in checking if an evsel is in the same
group is subtly broken for the "cycles" event. For the "cycles" event,
the pmu_name is NULL; however the logic in find_evsel_group() may set an
event matched against "cycles" as used, when it should not be.

This leads to a condition where an evsel is set, yet its leader is not.

Fix the check for evsel pmu_name by not matching evsels when either has a
NULL pmu_name.

There is still a pre-existing metric issue whereby the ordering of the
metrics may break the 'stat' function, as discussed at:
