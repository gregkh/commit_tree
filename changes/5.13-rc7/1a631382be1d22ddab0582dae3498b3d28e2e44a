remoteproc: Add new get_loaded_rsc_table() to rproc_ops

Add a new get_loaded_rsc_table() operation in order to support
scenarios where the remoteproc core has booted a remote processor
and detaches from it.  When re-attaching to the remote processor,
the core needs to know where the resource table has been placed
in memory.
