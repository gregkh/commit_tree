tools arch x86: Sync the msr-index.h copy with the kernel sources

To pick up the changes from these csets:

  d0946a882e622022 ("perf/x86/intel: Hybrid PMU support for perf capabilities")

That cause no changes to tooling as it isn't adding any new MSR, just
some capabilities for a pre-existing one:

  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/tracepoints/x86_msr.sh > before
  $ cp arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h tools/arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h
  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/tracepoints/x86_msr.sh > after
  $ diff -u before after
  $

Just silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h arch/x86/include/asm/msr-index.h
