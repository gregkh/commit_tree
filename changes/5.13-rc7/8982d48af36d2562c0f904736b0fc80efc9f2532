dmaengine: zynqmp_dma: Fix PM reference leak in zynqmp_dma_alloc_chan_resourc()

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it failed.
Forgetting to putting operation will result in reference leak here.
Fix it by replacing it with pm_runtime_resume_and_get to keep usage
counter balanced.
