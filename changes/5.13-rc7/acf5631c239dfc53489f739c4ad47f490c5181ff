usb: typec: mux: Fix matching with typec_altmode_desc

In typec_mux_match() "nval" is assigned the number of elements in the
"svid" fwnode property, then the variable is used to store the success
of the read and finally attempts to loop between 0 and "success" - i.e.
not at all - and the code returns indicating that no match was found.

Fix this by using a separate variable to track the success of the read,
to allow the loop to get a change to find a match.
