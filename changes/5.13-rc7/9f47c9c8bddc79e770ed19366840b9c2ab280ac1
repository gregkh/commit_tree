ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5640: Add used AIF to the components string

Depending on which AIF is used the UCM profile needs to setup
a different path through the rt5640's "Digital Mixer Path" graph.

ATM the UCM profiles solve this by just enabling paths to the outputs /
from the input from both AIF1 and AIF2 and then relying on the DAPM
framework to power-down the parts of the graph connected to the
unused AIF.

But in order to be able to use hardware-volumecontrol and to use
the hardware mute controls, which are necessary for mute LED control,
the UCM profiles need to know which AIF is actually being used.

Add a new "aif:1" or "aif:2" part to the component string to provide
info about the used AIF to userspace / to the UCM profiles.

Note the size of byt_rt5640_components is not increased because the
size of 32 chars already is big enough.
