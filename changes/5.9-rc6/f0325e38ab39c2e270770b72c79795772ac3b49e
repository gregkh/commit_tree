wlcore: Use spin_trylock in wlcore_irq_locked() for running the queue

We currently have a collection of flags and locking between the
threaded irq and tx work:

- wl->flags bitops
- wl->mutex
- wl->wl_lock spinlock

The bitops flags do not need a spinlock around them, and
wlcore_irq() already holds the mutex calling wlcore_irq_locked().
And we only need the spinlock to see if we need to run the queue
or not.

To simplify the locking, we can use spin_trylock and always run the
tx queue unless we know there's nothing to do.
