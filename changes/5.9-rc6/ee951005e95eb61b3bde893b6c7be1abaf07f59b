net: phy: clean up get_phy_c22_id() invalid ID handling

Move the ID check from get_phy_device() into get_phy_c22_id(), which
simplifies get_phy_device(). The ID reading functions are now
responsible for indicating whether they found a PHY or not via their
return code - they must return -ENODEV when a PHY is not present.
