drm/i915/gt: Always report the sample time for busy-stats

Return the monotonic timestamp (ktime_get()) at the time of sampling the
busy-time. This is used in preference to taking ktime_get() separately
before or after the read seqlock as there can be some large variance in
reported timestamps. For selftests trying to ascertain that we are
reporting accurate to within a few microseconds, even a small delay
leads to the test failing.
