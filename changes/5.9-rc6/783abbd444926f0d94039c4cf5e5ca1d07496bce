perf symbols: Add mwait_idle_with_hints.constprop.0 to the list of idle symbols

The "mwait_idle_with_hints" one was already there, some compiler
artifact now adds this ".constprop.0" suffix, cover that one too.

At some point we need to put these in a special bucket and show it
somewhere on the screen.

Noticed building the kernel on a fedora:32 system using:

  gcc version 10.2.1 20200723 (Red Hat 10.2.1-1) (GCC)
