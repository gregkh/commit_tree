HID: quirks: Always poll three more Lenovo PixArt mice

The PixArt OEM mice are known for disconnecting every minute in
runlevel 1 or 3 if they are not always polled. One Lenovo PixArt
mouse is already fixed. Got two references for 17ef:602e and three
references for 17ef:6019 misbehaving like this. Got one direct bug
report for 17ef:6093 from Wyatt Ward (wyatt8740). So add
HID_QUIRK_ALWAYS_POLL for all of them.
