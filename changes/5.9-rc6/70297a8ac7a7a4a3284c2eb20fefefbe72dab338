scsi: ufs: UFS crypto API

Introduce functions to manipulate UFS inline encryption hardware in line
with the JEDEC UFSHCI v2.1 specification and to work with the block keyslot
manager.

The UFS crypto API will assume by default that a vendor driver doesn't
support UFS crypto, even if the hardware advertises the capability, because
a lot of hardware requires some special handling that's not specified in
the aforementioned JEDEC spec. Each vendor driver must explicitly set
hba->caps |= UFSHCD_CAP_CRYPTO before ufshcd_hba_init_crypto_capabilities()
is called to opt-in to UFS crypto support.
