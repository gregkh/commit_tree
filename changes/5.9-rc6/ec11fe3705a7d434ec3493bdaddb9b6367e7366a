drm/amd/display: OLED panel backlight adjust not work with external display connected

[Why]
amdgpu_dm->backlight_caps is for single eDP only. the caps are upddated
for very connector. Real eDP caps will be overwritten by other external
display. For OLED panel, caps->aux_support is set to 1 for OLED pnael.
after external connected, caps+.aux_support is set to 0. This causes
OLED backlight adjustment not work.

[How]
within update_conector_ext_caps, backlight caps will be updated only for
eDP connector.
