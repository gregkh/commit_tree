vgacon: remove software scrollback support

Yunhai Zhang recently fixed a VGA software scrollback bug in commit
ebfdfeeae8c0 ("vgacon: Fix for missing check in scrollback handling"),
but that then made people look more closely at some of this code, and
there were more problems on the vgacon side, but also the fbcon software
scrollback.

We don't really have anybody who maintains this code - probably because
nobody actually _uses_ it any more.  Sure, people still use both VGA and
the framebuffer consoles, but they are no longer the main user
interfaces to the kernel, and haven't been for decades, so these kinds
of extra features end up bitrotting and not really being used.

So rather than try to maintain a likely unused set of code, I'll just
aggressively remove it, and see if anybody even notices.  Maybe there
are people who haven't jumped on the whole GUI badnwagon yet, and think
it's just a fad.  And maybe those people use the scrollback code.

If that turns out to be the case, we can resurrect this again, once
we've found the sucker^Wmaintainer for it who actually uses it.
