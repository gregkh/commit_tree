media: docs: dev-decoder: Add one more reason for dynamic change

Add bit-depth change as one more reason which could change in the
middle of the stream. For the worst case the stream is 8bit at the
beginning but later in the bit-stream it changes to 10bit. That
change should be propagated to the client so that it can take the
appropriate action. In that case it has to stop the streaming on
the capture queue, re-negotiate the pixel format, allocate new
buffers and start the streaming again.
