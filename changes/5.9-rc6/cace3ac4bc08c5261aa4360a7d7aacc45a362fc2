drm/msm/dpu: don't use INTF_INPUT_CTRL feature on sdm845

The INTF_INPUT_CTRL feature is not available on sdm845, so don't set it.

This also adds separate feature bits for INTF (based on downstream) instead
of using CTL feature bit for it, and removes the unnecessary NULL check in
the added bind_pingpong_blk function.

Fixes: 73bfb790ac786ca55fa2786a06f59 ("msm:disp:dpu1: setup display datapath for SC7180 target")
