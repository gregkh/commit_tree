thunderbolt: Add DP IN resources for all routers

USB4 spec allows DP tunneling from any router that has DP IN adapter,
not just from host router. The driver currently only added the DP IN
resources for the host router because Thunderbolt 1, 2 and 3 devices do
not have DP IN adapters. However, USB4 allows device routers to have DP
IN adapter as well so update the driver to add DP IN resources for each
device that has one. One example would be an eGPU enclosure where the
eGPU output is forwarded to DP IN port and then tunneled over the USB4
fabric.

Only limitation we add now is that the DP IN and DP OUT that gets paired
for tunnel creation should both be under the same topology starting from
host router downstream port. In other words we do not create DP tunnels
across host router at this time even though that is possible as well but
it complicates the bandwidth management and there is no real use-case
for this anyway.
