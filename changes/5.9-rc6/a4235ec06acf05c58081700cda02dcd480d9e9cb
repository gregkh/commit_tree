virtio: allow __virtioXX, __leXX in config space

Currently all config space fields are of the type __uXX.
This confuses people and some drivers (notably vdpa)
access them using CPU endian-ness - which only
works well for legacy or LE platforms.

Update virtio_cread/virtio_cwrite macros to allow __virtioXX
and __leXX field types. Follow-up patches will convert
config space to use these types.
