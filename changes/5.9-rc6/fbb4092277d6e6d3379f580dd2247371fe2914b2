ARM: multi_v7_defconfig: Enable additional support for Renesas platforms

Increase build and test coverage by enabling support for more hardware
present on Renesas SoCs and boards:
  - Dialog DA9063 PMIC "ONKEY", as used on the Stout and Silk boards,
  - Renesas RZ/A watchdog timer, as used on RZ/A1H and RZ/A2M boards,
  - Renesas RZ/A1H Capture Engine Unit, as used on the GR-Peach
    audiocamera shield expansion board,
  - Analog Devices ADV7612 HDMI receiver (incl. CEC), as used on the
    Koelsch and Lager boards,
  - Renesas RZ/A1H Realtime Clock, as used on the Genmai and RSK+RZA1
    boards.

All of the above are modular (CEC support is an optional feature of the
modular ADV7604 driver).
