habanalabs: check for DMA errors when clearing memory

In GAUDI we use QMAN0 DMA for clearing the MMU memory region
at initialization. if this operation fails it places the DMA in an error
state and then when trying to initialize QMAN0 we fail and erroneously
assume its the QMAN that failed.

This commit adds a check and clear of such DMA errors at initialization so
we will have a better understanding of what went wrong.
