time/sched_clock: Use raw_read_seqcount_latch()

sched_clock uses seqcount_t latching to switch between two storage
places protected by the sequence counter. This allows it to have
interruptible, NMI-safe, seqcount_t write side critical sections.

Since 7fc26327b756 ("seqlock: Introduce raw_read_seqcount_latch()"),
raw_read_seqcount_latch() became the standardized way for seqcount_t
latch read paths. Due to the dependent load, it also has one read
memory barrier less than the currently used raw_read_seqcount() API.

Use raw_read_seqcount_latch() for the seqcount_t latch read path.
