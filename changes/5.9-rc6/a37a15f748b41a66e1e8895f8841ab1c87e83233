dt-bindings: nvmem: Add properties needed for blowing fuses

On some systems it's possible to actually blow the fuses in the qfprom
from the kernel.  Add properties to support that.

NOTE: Whether this is possible depends on the BIOS settings and
whether the kernel has permissions here, so not all boards will be
able to blow fuses in the kernel.
