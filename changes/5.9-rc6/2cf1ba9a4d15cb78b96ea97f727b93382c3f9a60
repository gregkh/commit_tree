vhost_vdpa: implement IRQ offloading in vhost_vdpa

This patch introduce a set of functions for setup/unsetup
and update irq offloading respectively by register/unregister
and re-register the irq_bypass_producer.

With these functions, this commit can setup/unsetup
irq offloading through setting DRIVER_OK/!DRIVER_OK, and
update irq offloading through SET_VRING_CALL.
