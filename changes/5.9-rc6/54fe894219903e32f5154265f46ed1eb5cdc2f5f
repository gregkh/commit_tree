drm/ingenic: Rename ingenic-drm.c to ingenic-drm-drv.c

Full rename without any modification, except to the Makefile.

Renaming ingenic-drm.c to ingenic-drm-drv.c allow to decouple the module
name from the source file name in the Makefile. This will be useful
later when more source files are added.

v2: New patch
v3: No change
