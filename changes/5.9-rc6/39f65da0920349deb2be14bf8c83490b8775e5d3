Documentation: kunit: Remove references to --defconfig

The --defconfig option in kunit_tool was removed in [1], but the getting
started and kunit_tool documentation still encouraged its use. Update
those documents to reflect that it's no-longer required, and is the
default behaviour if no .kunitconfig is found.

Also update a couple of places where .kunitconfig is still referred to
as kunitconfig (this was changed in [2]).
