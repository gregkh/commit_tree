rtc: ds1307: provide an indication that the watchdog has fired

There's not much feedback when the ds1388 watchdog fires. Generally it
yanks on the reset line and the board reboots. Capture the fact that the
watchdog has fired in the past so that userspace can retrieve it via
WDIOC_GETBOOTSTATUS. This should help distinguish a watchdog triggered
reset from a power interruption.
