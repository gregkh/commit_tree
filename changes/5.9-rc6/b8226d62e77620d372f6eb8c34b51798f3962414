drm/i915/rkl: Handle comp master/slave relationships for PHYs

Certain combo PHYs act as a compensation master to other PHYs and need
to be initialized with a special irefgen bit in the PORT_COMP_DW8
register.  Previously PHY A was the only compensation master (for PHYs
B & C), but RKL adds a fourth PHY which is slaved to PHY C instead.
