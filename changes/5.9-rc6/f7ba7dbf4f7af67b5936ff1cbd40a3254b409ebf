net: macb: Properly handle phylink on at91sam9x

I just recently noticed that ethernet does not work anymore since v5.5
on the GARDENA smart Gateway, which is based on the AT91SAM9G25.
Debugging showed that the "GEM bits" in the NCFGR register are now
unconditionally accessed, which is incorrect for the !macb_is_gem()
case.

This patch adds the macb_is_gem() checks back to the code
(in macb_mac_config() & macb_mac_link_up()), so that the GEM register
bits are not accessed in this case any more.
