USB: UAS: fix disconnect by unplugging a hub

The SCSI layer can go into an ugly loop if you ignore that a device is
gone. You need to report an error in the command rather than in the
return value of the queue method.

We need to specifically check for ENODEV. The issue goes back to the
introduction of the driver.
