selftests/powerpc: Add test for pkey siginfo verification

Commit c46241a370a61 ("powerpc/pkeys: Check vma before
returning key fault error to the user") fixes a bug which
causes the kernel to set the wrong pkey in siginfo when a
pkey fault occurs after two competing threads that have
allocated different pkeys, one fully permissive and the
other restrictive, attempt to protect a common page at the
same time. This adds a test to detect the bug.
