ALSA: hda/realtek: Fix pin default on Intel NUC 8 Rugged

The jack on Intel NUC 8 Rugged rear panel doesn't work.

The spec [1] states that the jack supports both headphone and
microphone, so override a Pin Complex which has both Amp-In and Amp-Out
to make the jack work.

Node 0x1b fits the requirement, and user confirmed the jack now works
with new pin config.
