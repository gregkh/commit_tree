ASoC: topology: use break on errors, not continue

Since the beginning of the topology, the code continues to the next
object even when an error is detected.

The topology should be handled with an all-or-nothing design, loading
a partially valid topology is a sure way to get bug reports that are
difficult to deal with.

Changing the behavior may break previous solutions and expose problems
in topology files delivered in the past, so it's probably not wise to
add this patch to stable branches without revalidation.
