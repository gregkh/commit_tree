tools headers UAPI: update linux/in.h copy

To get the changes from:

  eba75c587e81 ("icmp: support rfc 4884")

That don't cause any changes in tooling, as we still don't have a
[gs]etsockopt 'level' beautifier, will try and have one soon.

This silences this tools/perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/uapi/linux/in.h' differs from latest version at 'include/uapi/linux/in.h'
  diff -u tools/include/uapi/linux/in.h include/uapi/linux/in.h
