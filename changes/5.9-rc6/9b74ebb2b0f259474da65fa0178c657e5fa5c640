cpumap: Use non-locked version __ptr_ring_consume_batched

Commit 77361825bb01 ("bpf: cpumap use ptr_ring_consume_batched") changed
away from using single frame ptr_ring dequeue (__ptr_ring_consume) to
consume a batched, but it uses a locked version, which as the comment
explain isn't needed.

Change to use the non-locked version __ptr_ring_consume_batched.
