mm/migrate: add a flags parameter to migrate_vma

The src_owner field in struct migrate_vma is being used for two purposes,
it acts as a selection filter for which types of pages are to be migrated
and it identifies device private pages owned by the caller.

Split this into separate parameters so the src_owner field can be used
just to identify device private pages owned by the caller of
migrate_vma_setup().

Rename the src_owner field to pgmap_owner to reflect it is now used only
to identify which device private pages to migrate.
