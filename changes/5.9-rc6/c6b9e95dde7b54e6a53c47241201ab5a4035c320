serial: 8250_exar: Fix number of ports for Commtech PCIe cards

The following in 8250_exar.c line 589 is used to determine the number
of ports for each Exar board:

nr_ports = board->num_ports ? board->num_ports : pcidev->device & 0x0f;

If the number of ports a card has is not explicitly specified, it defaults
to the rightmost 4 bits of the PCI device ID. This is prone to error since
not all PCI device IDs contain a number which corresponds to the number of
ports that card provides.

This particular case involves COMMTECH_4222PCIE, COMMTECH_4224PCIE and
COMMTECH_4228PCIE cards with device IDs 0x0022, 0x0020 and 0x0021.
Currently the multiport cards receive 2, 0 and 1 port instead of 2, 4 and
8 ports respectively.

To fix this, each Commtech Fastcom PCIe card is given a struct where the
number of ports is explicitly specified. This ensures 'board->num_ports'
is used instead of the default 'pcidev->device & 0x0f'.
