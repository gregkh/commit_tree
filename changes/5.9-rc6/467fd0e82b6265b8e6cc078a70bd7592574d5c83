ALSA: pcm: Fix build error on m68k and others

The commit 3ad796cbc36a ("ALSA: pcm: Use SG-buffer only when direct
DMA is available") introduced a check of the DMA type and this caused
a build error on m68k (and possibly some others) due to the lack of
dma_is_direct() definition.  Since the check is needed only for
CONFIG_SND_DMA_SGBUF enablement (i.e. solely x86), use #ifdef instead
of IS_ENABLED() for avoiding such a build error.
