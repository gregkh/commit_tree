bcache: allocate meta data pages as compound pages

There are some meta data of bcache are allocated by multiple pages,
and they are used as bio bv_page for I/Os to the cache device. for
example cache_set->uuids, cache->disk_buckets, journal_write->data,
bset_tree->data.

For such meta data memory, all the allocated pages should be treated
as a single memory block. Then the memory management and underlying I/O
code can treat them more clearly.

This patch adds __GFP_COMP flag to all the location allocating >0 order
pages for the above mentioned meta data. Then their pages are treated
as compound pages now.
