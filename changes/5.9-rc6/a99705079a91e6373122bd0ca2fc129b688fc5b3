mtd: spi-nor: cadence-quadspi: Provide a way to disable DAC mode

Currently direct access mode is used on platforms that have AHB window
(memory mapped window) larger than flash size. This feature is limited
to TI platforms as non TI platforms have < 1MB of AHB window.
Therefore introduce a driver quirk to disable DAC mode and set it for
non TI compatibles. This is in preparation to move to spi-mem framework
where flash geometry cannot be known.
