cifs: fix DFS mount with cifsacl/modefromsid

RHBZ: 1871246

If during cifs_lookup()/get_inode_info() we encounter a DFS link
and we use the cifsacl or modefromsid mount options we must suppress
any -EREMOTE errors that triggers or else we will not be able to follow
the DFS link and automount the target.

This fixes an issue with modefromsid/cifsacl where these mountoptions
would break DFS and we would no longer be able to access the share.
