scsi: ufs-mediatek: Prevent LPM operation on undeclared VCC

In some platforms, VCC regulator may not be declared in device tree to keep
itself "always-on". In this case, hba->vreg_info.vcc is NULL and shall not
be operated during any flow.

Prevent possible NULL hba->vreg_info.vcc access in LPM mode by checking
if it is valid first.
