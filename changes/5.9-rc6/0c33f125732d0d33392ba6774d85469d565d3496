kbuild: run the checker after the compiler

Since the pre-git time the checker is run first, before the compiler.
But if the source file contains some syntax error, the warnings from
the compiler are more useful than those from sparse (and other
checker most probably too).

So move the 'check' command to run after the compiler.
