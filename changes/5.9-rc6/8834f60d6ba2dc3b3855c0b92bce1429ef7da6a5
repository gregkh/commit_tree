usb: gadget: udc: mv_u3d_core: Remove unused static const 'driver_desc'

Looks like it's never been used.  Driver was mainlined in 2014.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/usb/gadget/udc/mv_u3d_core.c:35:19: warning: ‘driver_desc’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
 35 | static const char driver_desc[] = DRIVER_DESC;
 | ^~~~~~~~~~~
