ipmr: Copy option to correct variable

Cited commit mistakenly copied provided option to 'val' instead of to
'mfc':

```
-               if (copy_from_user(&mfc, optval, sizeof(mfc))) {
+               if (copy_from_sockptr(&val, optval, sizeof(val))) {
```

Fix this by copying the option to 'mfc'.
