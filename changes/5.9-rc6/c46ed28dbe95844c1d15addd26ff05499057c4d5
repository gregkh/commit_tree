dt-bindings: pwm: samsung: Do not require interrupts on Exynos SoCs

The bindings required interrupts for all SoCs but actually only the PWM
timer clocksource (for S3C/S5P SoCs) was using them.  This PWM timer
clocksource driver is not used on Exynos SoCs thus the interrupts can be
marked as optional.
