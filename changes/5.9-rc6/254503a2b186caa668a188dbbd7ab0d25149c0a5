omapfb: dss: Fix max fclk divider for omap36xx

The drm/omap driver was fixed to correct an issue where using a
divider of 32 breaks the DSS despite the TRM stating 32 is a valid
number.  Through experimentation, it appears that 31 works, and
it is consistent with the value used by the drm/omap driver.

This patch fixes the divider for fbdev driver instead of the drm.
