PCI: vmd: Use Shadow MEMBAR registers for QEMU/KVM guests

VMD device 28C0 natively assists guest passthrough of the VMD endpoint
through the use of shadow registers that provide Host Physical Addresses
to correctly assign bridge windows. These shadow registers are only
available if VMD config space register 0x70, bit 1 is set.

In order to support this mode in existing VMD devices which don't
natively support the shadow register, it was decided that the hypervisor
could offer the shadow registers in a vendor-specific PCI capability.

QEMU has been modified to create this vendor-specific capability and
supply the shadow membar registers for VMDs which don't natively support
this feature. This patch adds this mode and updates the supported device
list to allow this feature to be used on these VMDs.
