drm/dp_mst: Fix flushing the delayed port/mstb destroy work

Atm, a pending delayed destroy work during module removal will be
canceled, leaving behind MST ports, mstbs. Fix this by using a dedicated
workqueue which will be drained of requeued items as well when
destroying it.

v2:
- Check if wq is NULL before calling destroy_workqueue().
