nvme-core: replace ctrl page size with a macro

Saving the nvme controller's page size was from a time when the driver
tried to use different sized pages, but this value is always set to
a constant, and has been this way for some time. Remove the 'page_size'
field and replace its usage with the constant value.

This also lets the compiler make some micro-optimizations in the io
path, and that's always a good thing.
