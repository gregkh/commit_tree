scsi: fdomain: Mark 'fdomain_pm_ops' as __maybe_unused

Not all source files which include 'fdomain.h' make use of 'fdomain_pm_ops'
leaving them defined but unused.  Mark it as __maybe_unused to tell the
compiler this is not only acceptable, but expected.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 In file included from drivers/scsi/pcmcia/fdomain_cs.c:16:
 drivers/scsi/fdomain.h:106:32: warning: ‘fdomain_pm_ops’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
 106 | static const struct dev_pm_ops fdomain_pm_ops;
 | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
