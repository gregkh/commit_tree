drm/i915/tgl: Implement WAs 18011464164 and 22010931296

As today those 2 WAs have different implementation between TGL and DG1
WA pages but checking the HSD it is clear that DG1 implementation
should be used for both, also to do so is easier as we just need to
extend WA 1407928979 to B* stepping.

Both WAs are need to fix some possible render corruptions.

DG1 initial patches were not merged yet, as soon it is this WAs should
be applied to DG1 as well.
