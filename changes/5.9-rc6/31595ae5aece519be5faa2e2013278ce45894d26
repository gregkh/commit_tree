powerpc/eeh: Drop pdn use in eeh_pe_tree_insert()

This is mostly just to make the subsequent diffs less noisy. No functional
changes.

One thing that needs calling out is the removal of the "config_addr"
variable and replacing it with edev->bdfn. The contents of edev->bdfn are
the same, however it's worth pointing out that what RTAS calls a
"config_addr" isn't the same as the bdfn. The config_addr is supposed to
be: <bus><devfn><reg> with each field being an 8 bit number. Various parts
of the EEH code use BDFN and "config_addr" as interchangeable quantities
even though they aren't really.
