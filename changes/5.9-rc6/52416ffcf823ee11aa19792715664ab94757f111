x86/purgatory: Don't generate debug info for purgatory.ro

Purgatory.ro is a standalone binary that is not linked against the rest of
the kernel.  Its image is copied into an array that is linked to the
kernel, and from there kexec relocates it wherever it desires.

Unlike the debug info for vmlinux, which can be used for analyzing crash
such info is useless in purgatory.ro. And discarding them can save about
200K space.

 Original:
   259080  kexec-purgatory.o
 Stripped debug info:
    29152  kexec-purgatory.o
