ASoC: img-parallel-out: Fix a reference count leak

pm_runtime_get_sync() increments the runtime PM usage counter even
when it returns an error code, causing incorrect ref count if
pm_runtime_put_noidle() is not called in error handling paths.
Thus call pm_runtime_put_noidle() if pm_runtime_get_sync() fails.
