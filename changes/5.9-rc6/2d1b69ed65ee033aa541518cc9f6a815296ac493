net/mlx5: kTLS, Improve TLS params layout structures

Add explicit WQE segment structures for the TLS static and progress
params.
According to the HW spec, TISN is not part of the progress params context,
take it out of it.
Rename the control segment tisn field as it could hold either a TIS or
a TIR number.
