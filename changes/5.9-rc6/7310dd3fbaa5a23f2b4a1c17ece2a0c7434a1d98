Bluetooth: hci_qca: Simplify determination of serial clock on/off state from votes

The serial clocks should be on when there is a vote for at least one
of the clocks (RX or TX), and off when there is no 'on' vote. The
current logic to determine the combined state is a bit redundant
in the code paths for different types of votes, use a single
statement in the common path instead.
