drm/i915/rkl: Don't try to access transcoder D

There are a couple places in our driver that loop over transcoders A..D
for gen11+; since RKL only has three pipes/transcoders, this can lead to
unclaimed register reads/writes.  We should add checks for transcoder
existence where appropriate.

v2: Move one transcoder check that wound up in the wrong function after
    conflict resolution.  It belongs in bdw_get_trans_port_sync_config
    rather than bxt_get_dsi_transcoder_state.

v3: Switch loops to use for_each_cpu_transcoder_masked() since this
    iterator already checks the platform's transcoder mask for us.
