KVM: nSVM: more strict SMM checks when returning to nested guest

* check that guest is 64 bit guest, otherwise the SVM related fields
  in the smm state area are not defined

* If the SMM area indicates that SMM interrupted a running guest,
  check that EFER.SVME which is also saved in this area is set, otherwise
  the guest might have tampered with SMM save area, and so indicate
  emulation failure which should triple fault the guest.

* Check that that guest CPUID supports SVM (due to the same issue as above)
