docs: path-lookup: more markup fixes

"xxx``at``" makes the `` appear verbatim in the HTML output. I've opted
for changing this into ``*at()`` to harmonise this with the use of * seen
later in the same document (and add the parentheses to clarify that this
is a system/function call).

``path_``* also makes `` appear in the HTML output, but we can fix it by
moving the * into the ``. Also add the parantheses here.
