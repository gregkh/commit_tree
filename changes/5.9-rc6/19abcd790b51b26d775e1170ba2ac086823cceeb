PCI: cadence: Fix cdns_pcie_{host|ep}_setup() error path

commit bd22885aa188 ("PCI: cadence: Refactor driver to use as a core
library") while refactoring the Cadence PCIe driver to be used as
library, removed pm_runtime_get_sync() from cdns_pcie_ep_setup()
and cdns_pcie_host_setup() but missed to remove the corresponding
pm_runtime_put_sync() in the error path. Fix it here.
