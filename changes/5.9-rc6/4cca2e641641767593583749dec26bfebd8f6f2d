dma-buf: fix dma-fence-chain out of order test

There was probably a misunderstand on how the dma-fence-chain is
supposed to work or what dma_fence_chain_find_seqno() is supposed to
return.

dma_fence_chain_find_seqno() is here to give us the fence to wait upon
for a particular point in the timeline. The timeline progresses only
when all the points prior to a given number have completed.
