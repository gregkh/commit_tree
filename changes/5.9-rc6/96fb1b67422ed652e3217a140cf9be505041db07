iio: core: move debugfs data on the private iio dev info

This change moves all iio_dev debugfs fields to the iio_dev_priv object.
It's not the biggest advantage yet (to the whole thing of abstractization)
but it's a start.

The iio_get_debugfs_dentry() function (which is moved in
industrialio-core.c) needs to also be guarded against the CONFIG_DEBUG_FS
symbol, when it isn't defined. We do want to keep the inline definition in
the iio.h header, so that the compiler can better infer when to compile out
debugfs code that is related to the IIO debugfs directory.
