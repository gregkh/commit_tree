kbuild: Documentation: clean up makefiles.rst

This is a general cleanup of kbuild/makefiles.rst:

* Use "Chapter" for major heading references and use "section" for
  the next-level heading references, for consistency.
* Section 3.8 was deleted long ago.
* Drop the ending ':' in section names in the contents list.
* Correct some section numbering references.
* Correct verb agreement typo.
* Fix run-on sentence punctuation.
