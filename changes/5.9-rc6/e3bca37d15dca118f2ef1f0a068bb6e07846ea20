PCI: cadence: Fix updating Vendor ID and Subsystem Vendor ID register

Commit 1b79c5284439 ("PCI: cadence: Add host driver for Cadence PCIe
controller") in order to update Vendor ID, directly wrote to
PCI_VENDOR_ID register. However PCI_VENDOR_ID in root port configuration
space is read-only register and writing to it will have no effect.
Use local management register to configure Vendor ID and Subsystem Vendor
ID.
