thunderbolt: Retry DROM read once if parsing fails

Kai-Heng reported that sometimes DROM parsing of ASUS PA27AC Thunderbolt 3
monitor fails. This makes the driver to fail to add the device so only
DisplayPort tunneling is functional.

It is not clear what exactly happens but waiting for 100 ms and retrying
the read seems to work this around so we do that here.
