bpf, netns: Handle multiple link attachments

Extend the BPF netns link callbacks to rebuild (grow/shrink) or update the
prog_array at given position when link gets attached/updated/released.

This let's us lift the limit of having just one link attached for the new
attach type introduced by subsequent patch.

No functional changes intended.
