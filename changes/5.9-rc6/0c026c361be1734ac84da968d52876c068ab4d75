platform/x86: dell-wmi: add new keymap type 0x0012

These are events with extended data. The extended data is
currently ignored as userspace does not have a way to deal
it.

Ignore event with a type of 0x0012 and a code of 0xe035, as
the keyboard controller takes care of Fn lock events by itself.
This silences the following messages being logged when
pressing the Fn-lock key on a Dell Inspiron 5593:

dell_wmi: Unknown WMI event type 0x12
dell_wmi: Unknown key with type 0x0012 and code 0xe035 pressed

This is consistent with the behavior for the Fn-lock key
elsewhere in this file.
