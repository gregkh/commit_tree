kcsan: Remove existing special atomic rules

Remove existing special atomic rules from kcsan_is_atomic_special()
because they are no longer needed. Since we rely on the compiler
emitting instrumentation distinguishing volatile accesses, the rules
have become redundant.

Let's keep kcsan_is_atomic_special() around, so that we have an obvious
place to add special rules should the need arise in future.
