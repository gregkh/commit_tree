fbcon: Use array3_size() helper in scr_memcpyw()

Use array3_size() helper instead of the open-coded version in scr_memcpyw()
and scr_memsetw(). These sorts of multiplication factors need to be wrapped
in array3_size().

This issue was found with the help of Coccinelle and, audited and fixed
manually.
