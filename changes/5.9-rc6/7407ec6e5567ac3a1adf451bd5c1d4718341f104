drm/i915/sdvo: Make .get_modes() return the number of modes

.get_modes() is supposed to return the number of modes added to the
probed_modes list (not that anyone actually checks for anything
except zero vs. not zero). Let's do that. Also switch over to using
intel_connector_update_modes() instead of hand rolling it.
