audit: do not set FS_EVENT_ON_CHILD in audit marks mask

The audit group marks mask does not contain any events possible on
a child so setting the flag FS_EVENT_ON_CHILD in the mask is counter
productive.

It may lead to the undesired outcome of setting the dentry flag
DCACHE_FSNOTIFY_PARENT_WATCHED on a directory inode even though it is
not watching children, because the audit mark contribute the flag
FS_EVENT_ON_CHILD to the inode's fsnotify_mask and another mark could
be contributing an event that is possible on child to the inode's mask.

Furthermore in the following patches we want to use FS_EVENT_ON_CHILD
for non-dir inodes for other purposes so stop using the flag.
