vt: separate unicode handling into vc_translate_unicode

do_con_write is complicated enough. Extract unicode handling to a
separate function. For do_con_write, 249 LOCs lowered to 183 lines.

Use diff -w -b to see the difference is neligible -- mostly whitespace
and use of 'return's instead of 'continue's.
