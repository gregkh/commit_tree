ASoC: wm8994: Ensure the device is resumed in wm89xx_mic_detect functions

When the wm8958_mic_detect, wm8994_mic_detect functions get called from
the machine driver, e.g. from the card's late_probe() callback, the CODEC
device may be PM runtime suspended and any regmap writes have no effect.
Add PM runtime calls to these functions to ensure the device registers
are updated as expected.
This suppresses an error during boot
"wm8994-codec: ASoC: error at snd_soc_component_update_bits on wm8994-codec"
caused by the regmap access error due to the cache_only flag being set.
