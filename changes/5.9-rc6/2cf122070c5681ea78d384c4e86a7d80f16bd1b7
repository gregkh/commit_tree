drm/i915/rkl: Update TGP's pin mapping when paired with RKL

HPD pin handling for RKL+TGP is a special case; we effectively select
the HPD pin based on the DDI (A,B,D,E) rather than the PHY (A,B,C,D).
This differs from the regular behavior of RKL+CMP (and also TGL+TGP).

v2:
 - Rather than providing a custom hpd_pin mapping table, just assign
   encoder->hpd_pin in a custom manner for this setup.  (Ville)
