KVM: x86/mmu: Add sptep_to_sp() helper to wrap shadow page lookup

Introduce sptep_to_sp() to reduce the boilerplate code needed to get the
shadow page associated with a spte pointer, and to improve readability
as it's not immediately obvious that "page_header" is a KVM-specific
accessor for retrieving a shadow page.
