btrfs: file: reserve qgroup space after the hole punch range is locked

The incoming qgroup reserved space timing will move the data reservation
to ordered extent completely.

However in btrfs_punch_hole_lock_range() will call
btrfs_invalidate_page(), which will clear QGROUP_RESERVED bit for the
range.

In current stage it's OK, but if we're making ordered extents handle the
reserved space, then btrfs_punch_hole_lock_range() can clear the
QGROUP_RESERVED bit before we submit ordered extent, leading to qgroup
reserved space leakage.

So here change the timing to make reserve data space after
btrfs_punch_hole_lock_range().
The new timing is fine for either current code or the new code.
