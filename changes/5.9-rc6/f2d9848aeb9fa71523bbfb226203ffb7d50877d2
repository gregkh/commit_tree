iommu/arm-smmu: Workaround for Marvell Armada-AP806 SoC erratum #582743

Due to erratum #582743, the Marvell Armada-AP806 can't access 64bit to
ARM SMMUv2 registers.

Provide implementation relevant hooks:
- split the writeq/readq to two accesses of writel/readl.
- mask the MMU_IDR2.PTFSv8 fields to not use AArch64 format (but
only AARCH32_L) since with AArch64 format 32 bits access is not supported.

Note that most 64-bit registers like TTBRn can be accessed as two 32-bit
halves without issue, and AArch32 format ensures that the register writes
which must be atomic (for TLBI etc.) need only be 32-bit.
