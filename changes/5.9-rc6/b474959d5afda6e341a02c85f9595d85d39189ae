bpf: Fix a buffer out-of-bound access when filling raw_tp link_info

Commit f2e10bff16a0 ("bpf: Add support for BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD for bpf_link")
added link query for raw_tp. One of fields in link_info is to
fill a user buffer with tp_name. The Scurrent checking only
declares "ulen && !ubuf" as invalid. So "!ulen && ubuf" will be
valid. Later on, we do "copy_to_user(ubuf, tp_name, ulen - 1)" which
may overwrite user memory incorrectly.

This patch fixed the problem by disallowing "!ulen && ubuf" case as well.
