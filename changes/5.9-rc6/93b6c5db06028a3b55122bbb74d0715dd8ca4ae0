scsi: ufs: Fix possible infinite loop in ufshcd_hold

In ufshcd_suspend(), after clk-gating is suspended and link is set
as Hibern8 state, ufshcd_hold() is still possibly invoked before
ufshcd_suspend() returns. For example, MediaTek's suspend vops may
issue UIC commands which would call ufshcd_hold() during the command
issuing flow.

Now if UFSHCD_CAP_HIBERN8_WITH_CLK_GATING capability is enabled,
then ufshcd_hold() may enter infinite loops because there is no
clk-ungating work scheduled or pending. In this case, ufshcd_hold()
shall just bypass, and keep the link as Hibern8 state.
