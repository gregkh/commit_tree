iio:proximity:mb1232: Fix timestamp alignment and prevent data leak.

One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
this driver which uses a 16 byte s16 array on the stack   As Lars also noted
this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to userspace and that
indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by moving to
a suitable structure in the iio_priv() data with alignment
ensured by use of an explicit c structure.  This data is allocated
with kzalloc so no data can leak appart from previous readings.

In this case the forced alignment of the ts is necessary to ensure
correct padding on x86_32 where the s64 would only be 4 byte aligned.
