ice: Clear and free XLT entries on reset

This fix has been added to address memory leak issues resulting from
triggering a sudden driver reset which does not allow us to follow our
normal removal flows for SW XLT entries for advanced features.

- Adding call to destroy flow profile locks when clearing SW XLT tables.

- Extraction sequence entries were not correctly cleared previously
which could cause ownership conflicts for repeated reset-replay calls.
