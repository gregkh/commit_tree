raid5: remove the meaningless check in raid5_make_request

We can't guarntee the batched stripe to be set with STRIPE_HANDLE since
there are lots of functions could set the flag, such as sync_request,
ops_complete_* and end_{read,write}_request etc.

Also clear_batch_ready called in handle_stripe ensures the batched list
can't continue to be handled by handle_stripe.
