scsi: scsi_transport_fc: Match HBA Attribute Length with HBAAPI V2.0 definitions

According to 'include/scsi/scsi_transport_fc.h':

 "Attributes are based on HBAAPI V2.0 definitions"

... so it seems sane to match the 'HBA Attribute Length' to them.

If we don't, the compiler complains that the copied data will be truncated.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):
