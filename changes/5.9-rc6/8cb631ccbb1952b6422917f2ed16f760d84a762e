iio: Remove superfluous of_node assignments

If a driver does not assign an of_node to a IIO device to IIO core will
automatically assign the of_node of the parent device. This automatic
assignment is done in the iio_device_register() function.

There is a fair amount of drivers that currently manually assign the
of_node of the IIO device. All but 4 of them can make use of the automatic
assignment though.

The exceptions are:
 * mxs-lradc-adc: Which uses the of_node of the parent of the parent.
 * stm32-dfsdm-adc, stm32-adc and stm32-dac: Which reference the of_node
   assigned to the IIO device before iio_device_register() is called.

All other drivers are updated to use automatic assignment. This reduces
the amount of boilerplate code involved in setting up the IIO device.

The patch has mostly been auto-generated with the following semantic patch

// <smpl>

indio_dev = \(devm_iio_device_alloc\|iio_device_alloc\)(&parent, ...)
