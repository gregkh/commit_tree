RDMA/qedr: Add EDPM max size to alloc ucontext response

User space should receive the maximum edpm size from kernel driver,
similar to other edpm/ldpm related limits.  Add an additional parameter to
the alloc_ucontext_resp structure for the edpm maximum size.

In addition, pass an indication from user-space to kernel
(and not just kernel to user) that the DPM sizes are supported.

This is for supporting backward-forward compatibility between driver and
lib for everything related to DPM transaction and limit sizes.

This should have been part of commit mentioned in Fixes tag.
