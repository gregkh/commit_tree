switchdev: mrp: Extend switchdev API for MRP Interconnect

Extend switchdev API to add support for MRP interconnect. The HW is
notified in the following cases:

SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_IN_ROLE_MRP: This is used when the interconnect role
  of the node changes. The supported roles are MIM and MIC.

SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_IN_STATE_MRP: This is used when the interconnect ring
  changes it states to open or closed.

SWITCHDEV_OBJ_ID_IN_TEST_MRP: This is used to start/stop sending
  MRP_InTest frames on all MRP ports. This is called only on nodes that
  have the interconnect role MIM.
