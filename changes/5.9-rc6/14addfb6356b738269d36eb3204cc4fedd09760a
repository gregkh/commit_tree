net: mscc: ocelot: rename MSCC_OCELOT_SWITCH_OCELOT to MSCC_OCELOT_SWITCH

Putting 'ocelot' in the config's name twice just to say that 'it's the
ocelot driver running on the ocelot SoC' is a bit confusing. Instead,
it's just the ocelot driver. Now that we've renamed the previous symbol
that was holding the MSCC_OCELOT_SWITCH_OCELOT into *_LIB (because
that's what it is), we're free to use this name for the driver.
