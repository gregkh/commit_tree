locking, arch/ia64: Reduce <asm/smp.h> header dependencies by moving XTP bits into the new <asm/xtp.h> header

We want to remove the #include <asm/io.h> from <asm/smp.h>, but for this
we have to move the XTP bits into a separate header first (as these bits
rely on <asm/io.h> definitions), and include them in the .c files that rely
on those APIs.
