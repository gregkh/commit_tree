iio:light:max44000 Fix timestamp alignment and prevent data leak.

One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
this driver which uses a 16 byte array of smaller elements on the stack.
As Lars also noted this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to
userspace and that indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by
moving to a suitable structure in the iio_priv().
This data is allocated with kzalloc so no data can leak appart
from previous readings.

It is necessary to force the alignment of ts to avoid the padding
on x86_32 being different from 64 bit platorms (it alows for
4 bytes aligned 8 byte types.
