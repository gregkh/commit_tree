spi: spi-cadence-quadspi: Populate get_name() interface

Implement get_name() interface of spi_controller_mem_ops so as to avoid
changing of mtd->name due to driver being moved over to spi-mem
framework from SPI NOR. This avoids breaking of MTD cmdline args being
passed by bootloaders which maybe using old driver name.
