regulator: cpcap-regulator: Remove declared and set, but never used variable 'ignore'

It's okay to not check the return value that you're not conserned
about, however it is not okay to assign a variable and not check or
use the result.

Fixes W=1 warnings(s):

 drivers/regulator/cpcap-regulator.c:172:13: warning: variable ‘ignore’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 172 | int error, ignore;
 | ^~~~~~
