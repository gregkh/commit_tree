mptcp: avoid data corruption on reinsert

When updating a partially acked data fragment, we
actually corrupt it. This is irrelevant till we send
data on a single subflow, as retransmitted data, if
any are discarded by the peer as duplicate, but it
will cause data corruption as soon as we will start
creating non backup subflows.
