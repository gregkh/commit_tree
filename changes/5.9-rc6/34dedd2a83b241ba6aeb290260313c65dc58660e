ALSA: usb-audio: Disable Lenovo P620 Rear line-in volume control

The USB device (0x17aa:0x1046) that support Lenovo P620 rear panel
line-in claim to support volume control, but it doens't seem to have an
AMP, so when line-in volume lowers below 80, nothing gets recorded
anymore.

Disable the volume control to workaround the issue.
