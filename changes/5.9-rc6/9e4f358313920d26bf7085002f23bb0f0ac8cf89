drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Don't compile GPIO bits if not CONFIG_OF_GPIO

The kernel test robot noted that if "OF" is defined (which is needed
to select DRM_TI_SN65DSI86 at all) but not OF_GPIO that we'd get
compile failures because some of the members that we access in "struct
gpio_chip" are only defined "#if defined(CONFIG_OF_GPIO)".

All the GPIO bits in the driver are all nicely separated out.  We'll
guard them with the same "#if defined" that the header has and add a
little stub function if OF_GPIO is not defined.
