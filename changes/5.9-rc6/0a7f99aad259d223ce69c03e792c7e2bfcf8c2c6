clk: rockchip: use separate compatibles for rk3288w-cru

Commit 1627f683636d ("clk: rockchip: Handle clock tree for rk3288w variant")
added the check for rk3288w-specific clock-tree changes but in turn would
require a double-compatible due to re-using the main rockchip,rk3288-cru
compatible as entry point.

The binding change actually describes the compatibles as one or the other
so adapt the code accordingly and add a real second entry-point for the
clock controller.
