perf sched: Prefer sched_waking event when it exists

Commit fbd705a0c618 ("sched: Introduce the 'trace_sched_waking'
tracepoint") added sched_waking tracepoint which should be preferred
over sched_wakeup when analyzing scheduling delays.

Update 'perf sched record' to collect sched_waking events if it exists
and fallback to sched_wakeup if it does not. Similarly, update timehist
command to skip sched_wakeup events if the session includes sched_waking
(ie., sched_waking is preferred over sched_wakeup).
