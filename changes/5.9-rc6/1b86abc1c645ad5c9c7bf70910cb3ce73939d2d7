sched_clock: Expose struct clock_read_data

In order to support perf_event_mmap_page::cap_time features, an
architecture needs, aside from a userspace readable counter register,
to expose the exact clock data so that userspace can convert the
counter register into a correct timestamp.

Provide struct clock_read_data and two (seqcount) helpers so that
architectures (arm64 in specific) can expose the numbers to userspace.
