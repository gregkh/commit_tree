net/scm: Regularize compat handling of scm_detach_fds()

Duplicate the cleanups from commit 2618d530dd8b ("net/scm: cleanup
scm_detach_fds") into the compat code.

Replace open-coded __receive_sock() with a call to the helper.

Move the check added in commit 1f466e1f15cf ("net: cleanly handle kernel
vs user buffers for ->msg_control") to before the compat call, even
though it should be impossible for an in-kernel call to also be compat.

Correct the int "flags" argument to unsigned int to match fd_install()
and similar APIs.

Regularize any remaining differences, including a whitespace issue,
a checkpatch warning, and add the check from commit 6900317f5eff ("net,
scm: fix PaX detected msg_controllen overflow in scm_detach_fds") which
fixed an overflow unique to 64-bit. To avoid confusion when comparing
the compat handler to the native handler, just include the same check
in the compat handler.
