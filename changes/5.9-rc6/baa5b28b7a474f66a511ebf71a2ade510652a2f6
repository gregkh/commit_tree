RDMA/rtrs-srv: Replace device_register with device_initialize and device_add

There are error cases when we will call free_srv before device kobject is
initialized; in such cases calling put_device generates the following
warning:

 kobject: '(null)' (000000009f5445ed): is not initialized, yet
 kobject_put() is being called.

So call device_initialize() only once when the server is allocated. If we
end up calling put_srv() and subsequently free_srv(), our call to
put_device() would result in deletion of the obj. Call device_add() later
when we actually have a connection. Correspondingly, call device_del()
instead of device_unregister() when srv->dev_ref falls to 0.
