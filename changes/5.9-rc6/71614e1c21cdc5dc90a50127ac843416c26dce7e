Revert "serial: sh-sci: Initialize spinlock for uart console"

This reverts commit f38278e9b810b06aff2981d505267be984423ba3.

There has been a quick fix against uninitialised lock revealed by
the commit f743061a85f5 ("serial: core: Initialise spin lock before use
in uart_configure_port()"). Since we have now better fix in serial core,
this may be safely reverted.
