openrisc: Reserve memblock for initrd

Recently OpenRISC added support for external initrd images, but I found
some instability when using larger buildroot initrd images. It turned
out that I forgot to reserve the memblock space for the initrd image.

This patch fixes the instability issue by reserving memblock space.
