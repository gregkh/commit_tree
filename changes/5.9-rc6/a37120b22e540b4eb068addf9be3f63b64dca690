bnxt_en: Allocate additional memory for all statistics blocks.

Some of these DMAed hardware counters are not full 64-bit counters and
so we need to accumulate them as they overflow.  Allocate copies of these
DMA statistics memory blocks with the same size for accumulation.  The
hardware counter widths are also counter specific so we allocate
memory for masks that correspond to each counter.
