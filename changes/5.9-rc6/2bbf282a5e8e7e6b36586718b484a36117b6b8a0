s390/qdio: allow to scan all 128 Input SBALs

The comment is inaccurate, qdio_inbound_q_moved() and/or its callers no
longer get confused by a count of 128 completed SBALs.

Scanning all 128 SBALs at once can improve IRQ reduction (as we now
place the ACK at the right spot), and reduce the amount of processing
needed to handle all completed SBALs.
