iio: buffer: fix attach/detach pollfunc order

The original patch was error-ed by the submitter (me) and not by the author
(Lars).
After looking through the discussion logs (on email), it seems that this
order was wrong for the start, even though the order implemented in the
drivers was correct.

The last one was applied.

The idea is that pollfunc should be attached before calling the
'indio_dev->setup_ops->postenable' hook and should be detached after
calling the 'indio_dev->setup_ops->predisable' hook.

While the drivers were updated to take this into account, the change to the
IIO core was somehow omitted and was made wrong.

This change fixes the order to the proper form.
