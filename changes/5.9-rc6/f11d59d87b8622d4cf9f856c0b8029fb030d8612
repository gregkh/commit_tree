iio: Move attach/detach of the poll func to the core

All devices using a triggered buffer need to attach and detach the trigger
to the device in order to properly work. Instead of doing this in each and
every driver by hand move this into the core.

At this point in time, all drivers should have been resolved to
attach/detach the poll-function in the same order.

This patch removes all explicit calls of iio_triggered_buffer_postenable()
& iio_triggered_buffer_predisable() in all drivers, since the core handles
now the pollfunc attach/detach.

The more peculiar change is for the 'at91-sama5d2_adc' driver, since it's
not immediately obvious that removing the hooks doesn't break anything.
Eugen was able to test on at91-sama5d2-adc driver, sama5d2-xplained board.
All seems to be fine.
