staging: dpaa2-ethsw: setup MAC address of switch netdevices

At probe time, retrieve the MAC addresses of the switch ports using a
firmware call and use that to setup the switch interface net_device
instead of relying entirely on the user to configure a MAC address on
the interface. In case a switch interface is not connected to a MAC,
thus the dpsw_if_get_port_mac_addr() will return all zeroes, generate a
random MAC address and use that.

This new functionality is dependent on a firmware call which is
available only on newer versions, so depending on the running DPSW
object version skip this step.
