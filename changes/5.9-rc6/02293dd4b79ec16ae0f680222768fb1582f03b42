enetc: Refine buffer descriptor ring sizes

It's time to differentiate between Rx and Tx ring sizes.
Not only Tx rings are processed differently than Rx rings,
but their default number also differs - i.e. up to 8 Tx rings
per device (8 traffic classes) vs. 2 Rx rings (one per CPU).
So let's set Tx rings sizes to half the size of the Rx rings
for now, to be conservative.
The default ring sizes were decreased as well (to the next
lower power of 2), to reduce the memory footprint, buffering
etc., since the measurements I've made so far show that the
rings are very unlikely to get full.
This change also anticipates the introduction of the
dynamic interrupt moderation (dim) algorithm which operates
on maximum packet thresholds of 256 packets for Rx and 128
packets for Tx.
