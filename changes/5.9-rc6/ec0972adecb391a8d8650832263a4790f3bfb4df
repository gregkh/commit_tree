fbcon: Fix user font detection test at fbcon_resize().

syzbot is reporting OOB read at fbcon_resize() [1], for
commit 39b3cffb8cf31117 ("fbcon: prevent user font height or width change
 from causing potential out-of-bounds access") is by error using
registered_fb[con2fb_map[vc->vc_num]]->fbcon_par->p->userfont (which was
set to non-zero) instead of fb_display[vc->vc_num].userfont (which remains
zero for that display).

We could remove tricky userfont flag [2], for we can determine it by
comparing address of the font data and addresses of built-in font data.
But since that commit is failing to fix the original OOB read [3], this
patch keeps the change minimal in case we decide to revert altogether.
