rcu: Add comment documenting rcu_callback_map's purpose

The rcu_callback_map lockdep_map structure was added back in 2013, but
its purpose has become obscure.  This commit therefore documments that the
purpose of rcu_callback map is, in the words of commit 24ef659a857 ("rcu:
Provide better diagnostics for blocking in RCU callback functions"),
to help lockdep to tie an "inappropriate voluntary context switch back
to the fact that the function is being invoked from within a callback."
