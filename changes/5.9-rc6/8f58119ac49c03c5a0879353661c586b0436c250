mm, slub: make reclaim_account attribute read-only

The attribute reflects the SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT cache flag.  It's not
clear why this attribute was writable in the first place, as it's tied to
how the cache is used by its creator, it's not a user tunable.
Furthermore:

- it affects slab merging, but that's not being checked while toggled
- if affects whether __GFP_RECLAIMABLE flag is used to allocate page, but
  the runtime toggle doesn't update allocflags
- it affects cache_vmstat_idx() so runtime toggling might lead to incosistency
  of NR_SLAB_RECLAIMABLE and NR_SLAB_UNRECLAIMABLE

Thus make it read-only.
