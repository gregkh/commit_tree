drm/i915/gem: Delay tracking the GEM context until it is registered

Avoid exposing a partially constructed context by deferring the
list_add() from the initial construction to the end of registration.
Otherwise, if we peek into the list of contexts from inside debugfs, we
may see the partially constructed context and chase down some dangling
incomplete pointers.
