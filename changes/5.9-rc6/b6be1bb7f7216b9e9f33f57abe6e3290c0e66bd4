powerpc/32: Set user/kernel boundary at TASK_SIZE instead of PAGE_OFFSET

User space stops at TASK_SIZE. At the moment, kernel space starts
at PAGE_OFFSET.

In order to use space between TASK_SIZE and PAGE_OFFSET for modules,
make TASK_SIZE the limit between user and kernel space.

Note that fault.c already considers TASK_SIZE as the boundary between
user and kernel space.
