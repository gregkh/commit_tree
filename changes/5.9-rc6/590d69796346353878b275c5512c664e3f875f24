sched: Force the address order of each sched class descriptor

In order to make a micro optimization in pick_next_task(), the order of the
sched class descriptor address must be in the same order as their priority
to each other. That is:

 &idle_sched_class < &fair_sched_class < &rt_sched_class <
 &dl_sched_class < &stop_sched_class

In order to guarantee this order of the sched class descriptors, add each
one into their own data section and force the order in the linker script.
