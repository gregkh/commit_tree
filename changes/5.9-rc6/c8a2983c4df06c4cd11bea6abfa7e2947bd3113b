udp: Don't discard reuseport selection when group has connections

When BPF socket lookup prog selects a socket that belongs to a reuseport
group, and the reuseport group has connected sockets in it, the socket
selected by reuseport will be discarded, and socket returned by BPF socket
lookup will be used instead.

Modify this behavior so that the socket selected by reuseport running after
BPF socket lookup always gets used. Ignore the fact that the reuseport
group might have connections because it is only relevant when scoring
sockets during regular hashtable-based lookup.
