selftests: bpf: Switch off timeout

Several bpf tests are interrupted by the default timeout of 45 seconds added
by commit 852c8cbf34d3 ("selftests/kselftest/runner.sh: Add 45 second
timeout per test"). In my case it was test_progs, test_tunnel.sh,
test_lwt_ip_encap.sh and test_xdping.sh.

There's not much value in having a timeout for bpf tests, switch it off.
