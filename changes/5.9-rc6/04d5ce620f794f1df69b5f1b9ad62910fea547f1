Input: elan_i2c - add support for high resolution reports

Newer controllers (identified as "pattern" version 2) send higher
resolution reports, with 16-bit X and Y coordinates (previous generations
used 12-bit values). These new high resolution reports use report ID of
0x60.

SMbus controllers use the same buffer size for both the new and old
reports, and because of that high resolution reports no longer carry
area of contact data with SMbus.
