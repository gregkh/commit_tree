KVM: PPC: Fix typo on H_DISABLE_AND_GET hcall

On PAPR+ the hcall() on 0x1B0 is called H_DISABLE_AND_GET, but got
defined as H_DISABLE_AND_GETC instead.

This define was introduced with a typo in commit <b13a96cfb055>
("[PATCH] powerpc: Extends HCALL interface for InfiniBand usage"), and was
later used without having the typo noticed.
