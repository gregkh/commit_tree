KVM: SVM: avoid emulation with stale next_rip

svm->next_rip is reset in svm_vcpu_run() only after calling
svm_exit_handlers_fastpath(), which will cause SVM's
skip_emulated_instruction() to write a stale RIP.

We can move svm_exit_handlers_fastpath towards the end of
svm_vcpu_run().  To align VMX with SVM, keep svm_complete_interrupts()
close as well.

[Also move vmcb_mark_all_clean before any possible write to the VMCB.
