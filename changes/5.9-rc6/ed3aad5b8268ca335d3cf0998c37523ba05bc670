arm64: dts: ti: j721e-common-proc-board: Analog audio support

The codec is wired in multi DIN/DOUT setup (DIN1/2/3/4/DOUT1/2/3 is
connected to McASP serializer).

To support wide range of audio features a generic sound card can not be
used since we need to use different reference clock source for 44.1 and
48 KHz family of sampling rates.
Depending on the sample size we also need to use different slot width to
be able to support 16 and 24 bits.

There are couple of notable difference compared to DIN1/DOUT1 mode:
the channel mapping is 'random' for first look compared to the single
serializer setup:
        _      _      _
       |o|c1  |o|p1  |o|p3
 _     | |    | |    | |
|o|c3  |o|c2  |o|p4  |o|p2
------------------------

c1/2/3 - capture jacks (3rd is line)
p1/2/3/4 - playback jacks (4th is line)

2 channel audio (stereo):
0 (left):  p1/c1 left
1 (right): p1/c1 right

4 channel audio:
0: p1/c1 left
1: p2/c2 left
2: p1/c1 right
3: p2/c2 right

6 channel audio
0: p1/c1 left
1: p2/c2 left
2: p3/c3 left
3: p1/c1 right
4: p2/c2 right
5: p3/c3 right

8 channel audio
0: p1/c1 left
1: p2/c2 left
2: p3/c3 left
3: p4 left
4: p1/c1 right
5: p2/c2 right
