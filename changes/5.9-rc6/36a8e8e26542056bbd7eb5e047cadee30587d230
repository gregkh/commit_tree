bridge: Extend br_fill_ifinfo to return MPR status

This patch extends the function br_fill_ifinfo to return also the MRP
status for each instance on a bridge. It also adds a new filter
RTEXT_FILTER_MRP to return the MRP status only when this is set, not to
interfer with the vlans. The MRP status is return only on the bridge
interfaces.
