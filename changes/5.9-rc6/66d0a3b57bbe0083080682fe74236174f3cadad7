iwlwifi: Don't IWL_WARN on FW reconfiguration

IWL_WARN seems excessive here since this can happen during normal
operation. Every time I connect to a new network with 8086:24fd I get
this as KERN_WARNING on the console, which mildly distracts from other
more pressing messages. For example:

    % sudo journalctl _TRANSPORT=kernel | grep -c 'FW already configured'
    403
