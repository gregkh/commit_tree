brcmfmac: reduce maximum station interface from 2 to 1 in RSDB mode

The firmware state machines are not fully suitable for concurrent
station interface support, it may hit unexpected error if we have 2
different SSIDs and the roaming scenarios concurrently.
To avoid the bad user-experience if this is not fully validated, we
dis-allow user to create two concurrent station interfaces.
