perf evlist: Fix cpu/thread map leak

Asan reported leak of cpu and thread maps as they have one more refcount
than released.  I found that after setting evlist maps it should release
it's refcount.

It seems to be broken from the beginning so I chose the original commit
as the culprit.  But not sure how it's applied to stable trees since
there are many changes in the code after that.

Fixes: 7e2ed097538c5 ("perf evlist: Store pointer to the cpu and thread maps")
Fixes: 4112eb1899c0e ("perf evlist: Default to syswide target when no thread/cpu maps set")
