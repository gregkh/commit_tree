mptcp: __mptcp_tcp_fallback() returns a struct sock

Currently __mptcp_tcp_fallback() always return NULL
on incoming connections, because MPTCP does not create
the additional socket for the first subflow.
Since the previous commit no __mptcp_tcp_fallback()
caller needs a struct socket, so let __mptcp_tcp_fallback()
return the first subflow sock and cope correctly even with
incoming connections.
