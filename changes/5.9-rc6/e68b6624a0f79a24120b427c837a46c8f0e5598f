spi: spi-geni-qcom: Combine the clock setting code

There is code for adjusting the clock both in setup_fifo_params()
(called from prepare_message()) and in setup_fifo_xfer() (called from
transfer_one()).  The code is the same.  Abstract it out to a shared
function.

This is a no-op cleanup patch.  The only change is to the error string
if we fail to set the clock.  Since the two paths has marginally
different error messages I picked the clean one.
