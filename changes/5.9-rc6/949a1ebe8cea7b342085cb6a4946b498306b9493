ALSA: pcm: oss: Remove superfluous WARN_ON() for mulaw sanity check

The PCM OSS mulaw plugin has a check of the format of the counter part
whether it's a linear format.  The check is with snd_BUG_ON() that
emits WARN_ON() when the debug config is set, and it confuses
syzkaller as if it were a serious issue.  Let's drop snd_BUG_ON() for
avoiding that.

While we're at it, correct the error code to a more suitable, EINVAL.
