RDMA/bnxt_re: Fix the qp table indexing

qp->id can be a value outside the max number of qp. Indexing the qp table
with the id can cause out of bounds crash. So changing the qp table
indexing by (qp->id % max_qp -1).

Allocating one extra entry for QP1. Some adapters create one more than the
max_qp requested to accommodate QP1.  If the qp->id is 1, store the
inforamtion in the last entry of the qp table.
