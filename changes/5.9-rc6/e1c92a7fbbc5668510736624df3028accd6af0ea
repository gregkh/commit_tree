perf tests: Add another metric parsing test

The test goes through all metrics compiled for arch within pmu events
and try to parse them.

This test is different from 'test_parsing' in that we go through all the
events in the current arch, not just one defined for current CPU model.
Using 'fake_pmu' to parse events which do not have PMUs defined in the
system.

Say there's bad change in ivybridge metrics file, like:

  - a/tools/perf/pmu-events/arch/x86/ivybridge/ivb-metrics.json
  + b/tools/perf/pmu-events/arch/x86/ivybridge/ivb-metrics.json
  @@ -8,7 +8,7 @@
  -        "MetricExpr": "IDQ_UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED.CORE / (4 * ((
  +        "MetricExpr": "IDQ_UOPS_NOT_DELIVERED.CORE / / (4 *

the test fails with (on my kabylake laptop):

  $ perf test 'Parsing of PMU event table metrics with fake PMUs' -v
  parsing 'idq_uops_not_delivered.core / / (4 * (( ( cpu_clk_unh...
  syntax error, line 1
  expr__parse failed
  test child finished with -1
  ...

The test also defines its own list of metrics and tries to parse them.
It's handy for developing.

Committer notes:

Testing it:

  $ perf test fake
  10: PMU events                                            :
  10.4: Parsing of PMU event table metrics with fake PMUs   : FAILED!
  $ perf test -v fake |& tail
  parsing '(unc_p_freq_trans_cycles / unc_p_clockticks) * 100.'
  parsing '(unc_m_power_channel_ppd / unc_m_clockticks) * 100.'
  parsing '(unc_m_power_critical_throttle_cycles / unc_m_clockticks) * 100.'
  parsing '(unc_m_power_self_refresh / unc_m_clockticks) * 100.'
  parsing 'idq_uops_not_delivered.core / * (4 * cycles)'
  syntax error
  expr__parse failed
  test child finished with -1
  ---- end ----
  PMU events subtest 4: FAILED!
  $

And fix this error:

  tests/pmu-events.c:437:40: error: missing field 'idx' initializer [-Werror,-Wmissing-field-initializers]
        struct parse_events_error error = { 0 };
