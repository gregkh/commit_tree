objtool: Do not assume order of parent/child functions

If a .cold function is examined prior to it's parent, the link
to the parent/child function can be overwritten when the parent
is examined. Only update pfunc and cfunc if they were previously
nil to prevent this from happening.

This fixes an issue seen when compiling with -ffunction-sections.
