nvme: multipath: round-robin: fix single non-optimized path case

If there's only one usable, non-optimized path, nvme_round_robin_path()
returns NULL, which is wrong. Fix it by falling back to "old", like in
the single optimized path case. Also, if the active path isn't changed,
there's no need to re-assign the pointer.
