media: venus: fix multiple encoder crash

Currently we are considering the instances which are available
in core->inst list for load calculation in min_loaded_core()
function, but this is incorrect because by the time we call
decide_core() for second instance, the third instance not
filled yet codec_freq_data pointer.

Solve this by considering the instances whose session has started.
