MAINTAINERS: rectify entry in ARM SMC WATCHDOG DRIVER

Commit 5c24a28b4eb8 ("dt-bindings: watchdog: Add ARM smc wdt for mt8173
watchdog") added the new ARM SMC WATCHDOG DRIVER entry in MAINTAINERS, but
slipped in a minor mistake.

Luckily, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains:

  warning: no file matches F: devicetree/bindings/watchdog/arm-smc-wdt.yaml

Update file entry to intended file location.
