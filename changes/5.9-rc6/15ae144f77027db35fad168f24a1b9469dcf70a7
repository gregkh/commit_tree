mm/vmalloc: switch to "propagate()" callback

An augment_tree_propagate_from() function uses its own implementation that
populates a tree from the specified node toward a root node.

On the other hand the RB_DECLARE_CALLBACKS_MAX macro provides the
"propagate()" callback that does exactly the same.  Having two similar
functions does not make sense and is redundant.

Reuse "built in" functionality to the macros.  So the code size gets
reduced.
