ALSA: hda/conexant: Use the new vmaster mute LED helper

Convert the mute LED handling in Conexant codec to the new vmaster
mute helper.  A point to be cautiously handled is that the value
passed to the callback is inverted; the vmaster passes "enabled"
(0 = mute), while LED classdev passes "brightness" (1 = mute).

Also the assignment of the default vmaster hook is moved at a later
point after the mute hook is set up.  This assures no nested hook.

Finally, since we enable the mute-LED kcontrols always in the helper
side, the extra vmaster_mute_enum flag set up is dropped.
