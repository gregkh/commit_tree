seccomp: don't leave dangling ->notif if file allocation fails

Christian and Kees both pointed out that this is a bit sloppy to open-code
both places, and Christian points out that we leave a dangling pointer to
->notif if file allocation fails. Since we check ->notif for null in order
to determine if it's ok to install a filter, this means people won't be
able to install a filter if the file allocation fails for some reason, even
if they subsequently should be able to.

To fix this, let's hoist this free+null into its own little helper and use
it.
