scsi: libsas: Fix error path in sas_notify_lldd_dev_found()

In sas_notify_lldd_dev_found(), if we can't allocate the necessary
resources, then it seems like the wrong thing to mark the device as found
and to increment the reference count.  None of the callers ever drop the
reference in that situation.
