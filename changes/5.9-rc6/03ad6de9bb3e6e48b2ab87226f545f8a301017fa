staging: dpaa2-ethsw: disable switch ports are probe time

The MC firmware will enable the switch interfaces at DPSW creation
without waiting for an 'ifconfig up' on the switch interfaces. When this
happens, the states held by the Linux software vs the firmware are not
in sync. Make sure to disable the switch ports at probe time to not
encounter this issue.
