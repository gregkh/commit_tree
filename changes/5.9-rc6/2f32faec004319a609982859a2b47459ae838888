drm/amd/powerplay: skip invalid msg when smu set mp1 state

Some asic may not support for some message of set mp1 state.
If the return value of smu_send_smc_msg is -EINVAL, that means it failed
to send msg to smc as it can not map an valid message for the ASIC. And
with that case, smu_set_mp1_state should be skipped as those ASIC was in
fact do not support for that.
