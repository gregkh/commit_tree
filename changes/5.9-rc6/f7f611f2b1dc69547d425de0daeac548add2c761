ARM: s3c24xx: leds: Convert to use GPIO descriptors

This converts the s3c24xx LED driver to use GPIO descriptors
and also modify all board files to account for these changes
by registering the appropriate GPIO tables for each board.

The driver was using a custom flag to indicate open drain
(tristate) but this can be handled by standard descriptor
machine tables.

The driver was setting non-pull-up for the pin using the custom
S3C24xx GPIO API, but this is a custom pin control system used
by the S3C24xx and no generic GPIO function, so this has simply
been pushed back into the respective board files.
