[ia64] access_uarea(): stop bothering with gpregs_[gs]et()

We know this won't be called for child == current, so we don't need
to bother with callbacks, etc. - just do unw_init_from_blocked_task(),
unw_unwind_to_user() and do the payload of gpregs_[gs]et().  For
one register.  Which is to say, access_elf_reg().
