KVM: X86: Move kvm_apic_set_version() to kvm_update_cpuid()

There is no dependencies between kvm_apic_set_version() and
kvm_update_cpuid() because kvm_apic_set_version() queries X2APIC CPUID bit,
which is not touched/changed by kvm_update_cpuid().

Obviously, kvm_apic_set_version() belongs to the category of updating
vcpu model.
