kconfig: qconf: revive help message in the info view

Since commit 68fd110b3e7e ("kconfig: qconf: remove redundant help in
the info view"), the help message is no longer displayed.

I intended to drop duplicated "Symbol:", "Type:", but precious info
about help and reverse dependencies was lost too.

Revive it now.

"defined at" is contained in menu_get_ext_help(), so I made sure
to not display it twice.
