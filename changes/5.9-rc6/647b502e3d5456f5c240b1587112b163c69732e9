selftests/bpf: Refactor some net macros to bpf_tracing_net.h

Refactor bpf_iter_ipv6_route.c and bpf_iter_netlink.c
so net macros, originally from various include/linux header
files, are moved to a new header file
bpf_tracing_net.h. The goal is to improve reuse so
networking tracing programs do not need to
copy these macros every time they use them.
