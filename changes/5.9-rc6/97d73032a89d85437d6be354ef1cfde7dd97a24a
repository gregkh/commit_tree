ASoC: sti: uniperif: fix 'defined by not used' warning

Fix W=1 warning. The table uni_tdm_hw is declared in a header included
by multiple C file. This isn't really a good practice but for now
using __maybe_unused makes the following warning go away.

sound/soc/sti/sti_uniperif.c:12:
sound/soc/sti/uniperif.h:1351:38: warning: ‘uni_tdm_hw’ defined but
not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
 1351 | static const struct snd_pcm_hardware uni_tdm_hw = {
      |                                      ^~~~~~~~~~
