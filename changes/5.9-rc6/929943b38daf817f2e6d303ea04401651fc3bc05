fanotify: add support for FAN_REPORT_NAME

Introduce a new fanotify_init() flag FAN_REPORT_NAME.  It requires the
flag FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID and there is a constant for setting both flags
named FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME.

For a group with flag FAN_REPORT_NAME, the parent fid and name are
reported for directory entry modification events (create/detete/move)
and for events on non-directory objects.

Events on directories themselves are reported with their own fid and
"." as the name.

The parent fid and name are reported with an info record of type
FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME, similar to the way that parent fid is
reported with into type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID, but with an appended
null terminated name string.
