drm/amd/powerplay: enable thermal throttling logging support V2

Currently this feature is supported on Arcturus only. PMFW will
interrupt driver the first time when thermal throttling happened
and every one second afterwards if the throttling continuing. On
receiving the 1st interrupt, driver logs it the first time. However,
if the throttling continues, the logging will be performed every
minute to avoid log flooding.

V2: simplify the implemention by ratelimited printk
