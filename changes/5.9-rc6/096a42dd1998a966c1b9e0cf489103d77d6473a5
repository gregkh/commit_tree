drm/i915/gem: Move obj->lut_list under its own lock

The obj->lut_list is traversed when the object is closed as the file
table is destroyed during process termination. As this occurs before we
kill any outstanding context if, due to some bug or another, the closure
is blocked, then we fail to shootdown any inflight operations
potentially leaving the GPU spinning forever. As we only need to guard
the list against concurrent closures and insertions, the hold is short
and merits being treated as a simple spinlock.
