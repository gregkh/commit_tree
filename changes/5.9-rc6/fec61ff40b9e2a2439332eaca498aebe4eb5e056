clk: spear: Remove uninitialized_var() usage

Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
(or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings (e.g.
"unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized, either
simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes. As a precursor
to removing[2] this[3] macro[4], initialize "i" to zero. The compiler
warning was not a false positive, since clk_pll_set_rate()'s call to
clk_pll_round_rate_index() will always fail (since "prate" is NULL), so
"i" was never being initialized.
