libbpf: Add btf__set_fd() for more control over loaded BTF FD

Add setter for BTF FD to allow application more fine-grained control in more
advanced scenarios. Storing BTF FD inside `struct btf` provides little benefit
and probably would be better done differently (e.g., btf__load() could just
return FD on success), but we are stuck with this due to backwards
compatibility. The main problem is that it's impossible to load BTF and than
free user-space memory, but keep FD intact, because `struct btf` assumes
ownership of that FD upon successful load and will attempt to close it during
btf__free(). To allow callers (e.g., libbpf itself for BTF sanitization) to
have more control over this, add btf__set_fd() to allow to reset FD
arbitrarily, if necessary.
