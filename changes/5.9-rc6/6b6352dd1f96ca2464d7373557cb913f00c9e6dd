drm/amd/display: Disable idle optimizations before programming DCN

[Why]
Programming DCN is explicitly forbidden during idle optimzations allowed
state. Existing implemenation relies on OS/DM, which is not robust. Instead
DC should sequence this.

Note that DC will not re-enter idle optimized state on its own, it is only
responsible for catching out of sequence calls. It is still DM
responsibility to sequence appropriate for optimized power, but this change
removes the requirement for DM to cover the .1% case.

[How]
 - elevate updates during idle optimized state to full updates
 - disable idle power optimizations prior to programming
