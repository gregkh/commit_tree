ice: Allow all VLANs in safe mode

Currently the PF VSI's context parameters are left in a bad state when
going into safe mode. This is causing VLAN traffic to not pass. Fix this
by configuring the PF VSI to allow all VLAN tagged traffic.

Also, remove redundant comment explaining the safe mode flow in
ice_probe().
