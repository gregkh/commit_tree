exfat: remove EXFAT_SB_DIRTY flag

This flag is set/reset in exfat_put_super()/exfat_sync_fs()
to avoid sync_blockdev().
- exfat_put_super():
Before calling this, the VFS has already called sync_filesystem(),
so sync is never performed here.
- exfat_sync_fs():
After calling this, the VFS calls sync_blockdev(), so, it is meaningless
to check EXFAT_SB_DIRTY or to bypass sync_blockdev() here.

Remove the EXFAT_SB_DIRTY check to ensure synchronization.
And remove the code related to the flag.
