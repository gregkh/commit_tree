PCI: dwc: hisi: Remove non-ECAM HiSilicon hip05/hip06 driver

The HiSilicon non-ECAM PCIe has been broken since March 2016 commit
7e57fd1444bf ("PCI: designware: Move Root Complex setup code to
dw_pcie_setup_rc()"). The reason is this commit moved the iATU setup code
from dw_pcie_host_init() to dw_pcie_setup_rc(), but the hisi driver never
calls dw_pcie_setup_rc(). The result is the PCI memory space is never
configured and the driver can't work. It's also clear it has an iATU as
the config space accesses use it.

There's also no dts file using either "hisilicon,hip05-pcie" or
"hisilicon,hip06-pcie".
