NFS: Zero-stateid SETATTR should first return delegation

If a write delegation isn't available, the Linux NFS client uses
a zero-stateid when performing a SETATTR.

NFSv4.0 provides no mechanism for an NFS server to match such a
request to a particular client. It recalls all delegations for that
file, even delegations held by the client issuing the request. If
that client happens to hold a read delegation, the server will
recall it immediately, resulting in an NFS4ERR_DELAY/CB_RECALL/
DELEGRETURN sequence.

Optimize out this pipeline bubble by having the client return any
delegations it may hold on a file before it issues a
SETATTR(zero-stateid) on that file.
