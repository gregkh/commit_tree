thermal: core: Fix use-after-free in thermal_zone_device_unregister()

The user-after-free bug in thermal_zone_device_unregister() is reported by
KASAN. It happens because struct thermal_zone_device is released during of
device_unregister() invocation, and hence the "tz" variable shouldn't be
touched by thermal_notify_tz_delete(tz->id).
