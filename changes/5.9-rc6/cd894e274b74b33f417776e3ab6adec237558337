arm64: dts: mt8183: Add krane-sku176 board

Also known as the Lenovo IdeaPad Duet Chromebook.

There are different krane boards with shared resources, hence a
mt8183-kukui-krane.dtsi was created for easily introduce future new
boards. The same happens with the baseboard codenamed kukui where
different variants, apart from kukui variant can take advantage of the
shared resources.
