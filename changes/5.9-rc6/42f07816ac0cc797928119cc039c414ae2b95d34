dyndbg: fix problem parsing format="foo bar"

commit 14775b049642 ("dyndbg: accept query terms like file=bar and
module=foo") added the combined keyword=value parsing poorly; revert
most of it, keeping the keyword & arg change.

Instead, fix the tokenizer for the new input, by terminating the
keyword (an unquoted word) on '=' as well as space, thus letting the
tokenizer work on the quoted argument, like it would have previously.

Also add a few debug-prints to show more parsing context, into
tokenizer and parse-query, and use "keyword, value" in others.
