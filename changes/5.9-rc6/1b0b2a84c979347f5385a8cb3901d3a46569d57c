iommu: Make some functions static

The sparse tool complains as follows:

drivers/iommu/iommu.c:386:5: warning:
 symbol 'iommu_insert_resv_region' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/iommu/iommu.c:2182:5: warning:
 symbol '__iommu_map' was not declared. Should it be static?

Those functions are not used outside of iommu.c, so mark them static.
