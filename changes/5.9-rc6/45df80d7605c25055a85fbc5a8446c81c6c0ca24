misc: eeprom: at24: register nvmem only after eeprom is ready to use

During nvmem_register() the nvmem core sends notifications when:

    - cell added
    - nvmem added

and during these notifications some callback func may access the nvmem
device, which will fail in case of at24 eeprom because regulator and pm
are enabled after nvmem_register().

Fixes: b20eb4c1f026 ("eeprom: at24: drop unnecessary label")
