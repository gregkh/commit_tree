scsi: lpfc: Fix language in 0373 message to reflect non-error message

Change vocabulary of 0373 log msg from "error" to "cmpl" The current
language of the 0373 message contains the word "error" which caused a
number of customers to inquire about the "error" and if it should be a
concern. It isn't an error, it's simply an io completion status.

Revise the message to replace the word "error" with "cmpl" for completion.
