scsi: aic7xxx: Fix 'amount_xferred' set but not used issue

'amount_xferred' is used, but only in certain circumstances.  Place the
same stipulations on the defining/allocating of 'amount_xferred' as is
placed when using it.

We've been careful not to change any of the ordering semantics here.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c: In function ‘ahc_done’:
 drivers/scsi/aic7xxx/aic7xxx_osm.c:1725:12: warning: variable ‘amount_xferred’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 1725 | uint32_t amount_xferred;
 | ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~
