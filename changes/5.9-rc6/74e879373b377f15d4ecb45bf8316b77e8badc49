ring-buffer: Move the add_timestamp into its own function

Make a helper function rb_add_timestamp() that moves the adding of the
extended time stamps into its own function. Also, remove the noinline and
inline for the functions it calls, as recent benchmarks appear they do not
make a difference (just let gcc decide).
