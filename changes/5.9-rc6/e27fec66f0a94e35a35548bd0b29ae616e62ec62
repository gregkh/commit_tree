dm integrity: fix error reporting in bitmap mode after creation

The dm-integrity target did not report errors in bitmap mode just after
creation. The reason is that the function integrity_recalc didn't clean up
ic->recalc_bitmap as it proceeded with recalculation.

Fix this by updating the bitmap accordingly -- the double shift serves
to rounddown.
