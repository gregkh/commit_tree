ASoC: tegra: Add Tegra186 based DSPK driver

The Digital Speaker Controller (DSPK) converts the multi-bit Pulse Code
Modulation (PCM) audio input to oversampled 1-bit Pulse Density Modulation
(PDM) output. From the signal flow perpsective, the DSPK can be viewed as
a PDM transmitter that up-samples the input to the desired sampling rate
by interpolation then converts the oversampled PCM input to the desired
1-bit output via Delta Sigma Modulation (DSM).

This patch registers DSPK component with ASoC framework. The component
driver exposes DAPM widgets, routes and kcontrols for the device. The DAI
driver exposes DSPK interfaces, which can be used to connect different
components in the ASoC layer. Makefile and Kconfig support is added to
allow to build the driver. The DSPK devices can be enabled in the DT via
"nvidia,tegra186-dspk" compatible binding. This driver can be used
on Tegra194 chip as well.
