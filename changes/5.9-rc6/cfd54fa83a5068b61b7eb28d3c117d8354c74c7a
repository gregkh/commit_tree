usb: Fix out of sync data toggle if a configured device is reconfigured

Userspace drivers that use a SetConfiguration() request to "lightweight"
reset an already configured usb device might cause data toggles to get out
of sync between the device and host, and the device becomes unusable.

The xHCI host requires endpoints to be dropped and added back to reset the
toggle. If USB core notices the new configuration is the same as the
current active configuration it will avoid these extra steps by calling
usb_reset_configuration() instead of usb_set_configuration().

A SetConfiguration() request will reset the device side data toggles.
Make sure usb_reset_configuration() function also drops and adds back the
endpoints to ensure data toggles are in sync.

To avoid code duplication split the current usb_disable_device() function
and reuse the endpoint specific part.
