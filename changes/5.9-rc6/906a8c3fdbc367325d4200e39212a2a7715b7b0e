io_uring: fix punting req w/o grabbed env

It's not enough to check for REQ_F_WORK_INITIALIZED and punt async
assuming that io_req_work_grab_env() was called, it may not have been.
E.g. io_close_prep() and personality path set the flag without further
async init.

As a quick fix, always pass next work through io_req_task_queue().
