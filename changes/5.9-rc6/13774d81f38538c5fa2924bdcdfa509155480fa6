ALSA: hda: fix a runtime pm issue in SOF when integrated GPU is disabled

In snd_hdac_device_init pm_runtime_set_active is called to
increase child_count in parent device. But when it is failed
to build connection with GPU for one case that integrated
graphic gpu is disabled, snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_exit will be
invoked to clean up a HD-audio extended codec base device. At
this time the child_count of parent is not decreased, which
makes parent device can't get suspended.

This patch calls pm_runtime_set_suspended to decrease child_count
in parent device in snd_hdac_device_exit to match with
snd_hdac_device_init. pm_runtime_set_suspended can make sure that
it will not decrease child_count if the device is already suspended.
