fanotify: report events with parent dir fid to sb/mount/non-dir marks

In a group with flag FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID, when adding an inode mark with
FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD, events on non-directory children are reported with
the fid of the parent.

When adding a filesystem or mount mark or mark on a non-dir inode, we
want to report events that are "possible on child" (e.g. open/close)
also with fid of the parent, as if the victim inode's parent is
interested in events "on child".

Some events, currently only FAN_MOVE_SELF, should be reported to a
sb/mount/non-dir mark with parent fid even though they are not
reported to a watching parent.

To get the desired behavior we set the flag FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD on
all the sb/mount/non-dir mark masks in a group with FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID.
