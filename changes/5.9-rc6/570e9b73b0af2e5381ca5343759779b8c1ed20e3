blk-mq: move blk_mq_get_driver_tag into blk-mq.c

blk_mq_get_driver_tag() is only used by blk-mq.c and is supposed to
stay in blk-mq.c, so move it and preparing for cleanup code of
get/put driver tag.

Meantime hctx_may_queue() is moved to header file and it is fine
since it is defined as inline always.

No functional change.
