ACPI: tables: Remove the duplicated checks for acpi_parse_entries_array()

acpi_disabled, pointer id and table_header are checked in
acpi_table_parse_entries_array(), and acpi_parse_entries_array() is
only called by acpi_table_parse_entries_array(), so those checks in
acpi_parse_entries_array() are duplicate.

Remove those duplicated checks and move the table_size check to
acpi_table_parse_entries_array() as well.
