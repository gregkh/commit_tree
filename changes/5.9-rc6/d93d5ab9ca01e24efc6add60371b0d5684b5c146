mm/page_alloc.c: simplify pageblock bitmap access

Due to commit e58469bafd05 ("mm: page_alloc: use word-based accesses for
get/set pageblock bitmaps"), pageblock bitmap is accessed with word-based
access.  This operation could be simplified a little.

Intuitively, if we want to get a bit range [start_idx, end_idx] in a word,
we can do like this:

    mask = (1 << (end_bitidx - start_bitidx + 1)) - 1;
    ret = (word >> start_idx) & mask;

And also if we want to set a bit range [start_idx, end_idx] with flags, we
can do the same by just shift start_bitidx.

By doing so we reduce some instructions for these two helper functions:

                                Before   Patched
    set_pfnblock_flags_mask     209      198(-5%)
    get_pfnblock_flags_mask     101      87(-13%)

Since the syntax is changed a little, we need to check the whole 4-bit
migrate_type instead of part of it.
