drm/amd/display: Check lane status again after link training done

[Why]
Some monitors could suffer symbol unlock but cannot send HPD IRQ to
notic source device to handle link loss. This makes monitor stuck in
abnormal status and causes black screen.

[How]
According to the suggestion from scalar vendor, to check lane status
again after link training done. That can improve the comaptibility
from current production monitors.
