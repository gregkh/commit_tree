usb: typec: intel_pmc_mux: Do not configure SBU and HSL Orientation in Alternate modes

According to the PMC Type C Subsystem (TCSS) Mux programming guide rev
0.7, bits 4 and 5 are reserved in Alternate modes.
SBU Orientation and HSL Orientation needs to be configured only during
initial cable detection in USB connect flow based on device property of
"sbu-orientation" and "hsl-orientation".
Configuring these reserved bits in the Alternate modes may result in delay
in display link training or some unexpected behaviour.
So do not configure them while issuing Alternate Mode requests.
