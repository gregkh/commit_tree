drm/amd/display: Send VSIF on unsupported modes on DAL

[Why]
Current DAL behaviour is to not send VSIF if mode does not support VRR
(ie. FS range is < 10Hz). However, we should still set FS Native Color
Active bit in some unsupported mode cases.

[How]
Remove check for if VRR is supported before building infopacket.
