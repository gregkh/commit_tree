arm64: tegra: Populate VBUS for USB3 on Jetson TX2

The VBUS for USB3 connector on the Jetson TX2 is connected to the
vdd_usb1 supply and although this is populated for the USB2 port
on the USB3 connector it is not populated for the USB3 port and
causes the following warning to be seen on boot ...

 usb3-0: supply vbus not found, using dummy regulator

Fix this by also adding the VBUS supply to the USB3 port.
