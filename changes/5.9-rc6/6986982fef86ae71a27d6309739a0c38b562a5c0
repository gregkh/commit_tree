KVM: x86: rename update_bp_intercept to update_exception_bitmap

We would like to introduce a callback to update the #PF intercept
when CPUID changes.  Just reuse update_bp_intercept since VMX is
already using update_exception_bitmap instead of a bespoke function.

While at it, remove an unnecessary assignment in the SVM version,
which is already done in the caller (kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_set_guest_debug)
and has nothing to do with the exception bitmap.
