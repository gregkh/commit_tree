net: dsa: felix: move probing to felix_vsc9959.c

Felix is not actually meant to be a DSA driver only for the switch
inside NXP LS1028A, but an umbrella for all Vitesse / Microsemi /
Microchip switches that are register-compatible with Ocelot and that are
using in DSA mode (with an NPI Ethernet port).

For the dsa_switch_ops exported by the felix driver to be generic enough
to be used by other non-PCI switches, we need to move the PCI-specific
probing to the low-level translation module felix_vsc9959.c. This way,
other switches can have their own probing functions, as platform devices
or otherwise.

This patch also removes the "Felix instance table", which did not stand
the test of time and is unnecessary at this point.
