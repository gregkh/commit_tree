x86: Expose SERIALIZE for supported cpuid

The SERIALIZE instruction is supported by Tntel processors, like
Sapphire Rapids.  SERIALIZE is a faster serializing instruction which
does not modify registers, arithmetic flags or memory, will not cause VM
exit. It's availability is indicated by CPUID.(EAX=7,ECX=0):ECX[bit 14].

Expose it in KVM supported CPUID.  This way, KVM could pass this
information to guests and they can make use of these features accordingly.
