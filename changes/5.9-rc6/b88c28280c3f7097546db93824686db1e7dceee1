firmware: qcom_scm: Fix legacy convention SCM accessors

The move to a combined driver for the QCOM SCM hardware changed the
io_writel and io_readl helpers to use non-atomic calls, despite the
commit message saying that atomic was a better option. This breaks these
helpers on hardware that uses the old legacy convention (access fails
with a -95 return code). Switch back to using the atomic calls.

Observed as a failure routing GPIO interrupts to the Apps processor on
an IPQ8064; fix is confirmed as correctly allowing the interrupts to be
routed and observed.
