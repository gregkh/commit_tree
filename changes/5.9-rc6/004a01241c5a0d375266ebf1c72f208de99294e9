arm64/x86: KVM: Introduce steal-time cap

arm64 requires a vcpu fd (KVM_HAS_DEVICE_ATTR vcpu ioctl) to probe
support for steal-time. However this is unnecessary, as only a KVM
fd is required, and it complicates userspace (userspace may prefer
delaying vcpu creation until after feature probing). Introduce a cap
that can be checked instead. While x86 can already probe steal-time
support with a kvm fd (KVM_GET_SUPPORTED_CPUID), we add the cap there
too for consistency.
