dnotify: report both events on parent and child with single callback

For some events (e.g. DN_ATTRIB on sub-directory) fsnotify may call
dnotify_handle_event() once for watching parent and once again for
the watching sub-directory.

Do the same thing with a single callback instead of two callbacks when
marks iterator contains both inode and child entries.
