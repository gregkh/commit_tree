mac80211: Handle special status codes in SAE commit

SAE authentication has been extended with H2E (IEEE 802.11 REVmd) and PK
(WFA) options. Those extensions use special status code values in the
SAE commit messages (Authentication frame with transaction sequence
number 1) to identify which extension is in use. mac80211 was
interpreting those new values as the AP denying authentication and that
resulted in failure to complete SAE authentication in some cases.

Fix this by adding exceptions for the new status code values 126 and
127.
