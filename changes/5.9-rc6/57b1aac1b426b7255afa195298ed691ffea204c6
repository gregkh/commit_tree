crypto: hisilicon - update SEC driver module parameter

As stress-ng running SEC engine on the Ubuntu OS,
we found that SEC only supports two threads each with one TFM
based on the default module parameter 'ctx_q_num'.
If running more threads, stress-ng will fail since it cannot
get more TFMs.

In order to fix this, we adjusted the default values
of the module parameters to support more TFMs.
