x86/msr: Move the F15h MSRs where they belong

1068ed4547ad ("x86/msr: Lift AMD family 0x15 power-specific MSRs")

moved the three F15h power MSRs to the architectural list but that was
wrong as they belong in the family 0x15 list. That also caused:

  In file included from trace/beauty/tracepoints/x86_msr.c:10:
  perf/trace/beauty/generated/x86_arch_MSRs_array.c:292:45: error: initialized field overwritten [-Werror=override-init]
    292 |  [0xc0010280 - x86_AMD_V_KVM_MSRs_offset] = "F15H_PTSC",
        |                                             ^~~~~~~~~~~
  perf/trace/beauty/generated/x86_arch_MSRs_array.c:292:45: note: (near initialization for 'x86_AMD_V_KVM_MSRs[640]')

due to MSR_F15H_PTSC ending up being defined twice. Move them where they
belong and drop the duplicate.

Also, drop the respective tools/ changes of the msr-index.h copy the
above commit added because perf tool developers prefer to go through
those changes themselves in order to figure out whether changes to the
kernel headers would need additional handling in perf.
