ARM: dts: stm32: configure i2c5 support on stm32mp15xx-dkx

Configure I2C5 on stm32mp15 DK boards. It's available and can be used on:
- Arduino connector
- GPIO expansion connector
Keep it disabled by default, so the pins are kept in their initial state to
lower power consumption. This way they can also be used as GPIO.
