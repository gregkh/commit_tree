btrfs: qgroup: free per-trans reserved space when a subvolume gets dropped

[BUG]
Sometime fsstress could lead to qgroup warning for case like
generic/013:

  BTRFS warning (device dm-3): qgroup 0/259 has unreleased space, type 1 rsv 81920
  ------------[ cut here ]------------

  BTRFS error (device dm-3): qgroup reserved space leaked

While that subvolume 259 is no longer in that filesystem.

[CAUSE]
Normally per-trans qgroup reserved space is freed when a transaction is
committed, in commit_fs_roots().

However for completely dropped subvolume, that subvolume is completely
gone, thus is no longer in the fs_roots_radix, and its per-trans
reserved qgroup will never be freed.

Since the subvolume is already gone, leaked per-trans space won't cause
any trouble for end users.

[FIX]
Just call btrfs_qgroup_free_meta_all_pertrans() before a subvolume is
completely dropped.
