dmaengine: Introduce DMA-device device_caps callback

There are DMA devices (like ours version of Synopsys DW DMAC) which have
DMA capabilities non-uniformly redistributed between the device channels.
In order to provide a way of exposing the channel-specific parameters to
the DMA engine consumers, we introduce a new DMA-device callback. In case
if provided it gets called from the dma_get_slave_caps() method and is
able to override the generic DMA-device capabilities.
