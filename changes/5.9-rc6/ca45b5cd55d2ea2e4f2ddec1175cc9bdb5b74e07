serial: msm_serial: add sparse context annotation

Add sparse context annotation to the receive handlers, which release and
reacquire the port lock, to silence sparse warnings:

	drivers/tty/serial/msm_serial.c:748:25: warning: context imbalance in 'msm_handle_rx_dm' - unexpected unlock
	drivers/tty/serial/msm_serial.c:814:28: warning: context imbalance in 'msm_handle_rx' - unexpected unlock
