usb: typec: intel_pmc_mux: Do not configure Altmode HPD High

According to the PMC Type C Subsystem (TCSS) Mux programming guide rev
0.7, bit 14 is reserved in Alternate mode.
In DP Alternate Mode state, if the HPD_STATE (bit 7) field in the
status update command VDO is set to HPD_HIGH, HPD is configured via
separate HPD mode request after configuring DP Alternate mode request.
Configuring reserved bit may show unexpected behaviour.
So do not configure them while issuing the Alternate Mode request.
