pinctrl: stm32: use the hwspin_lock_timeout_in_atomic() API

Use the hwspin_lock_timeout_in_atomic() API which is the most appropriated
here. Indeed:
- hwspin_lock_() is called after spin_lock_irqsave()
- the hwspin_lock_timeout() API relies on jiffies count which won't work
  if IRQs are disabled which is the case here.
