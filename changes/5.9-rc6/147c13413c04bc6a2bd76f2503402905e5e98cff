powerpc/64: Fix an out of date comment about MMIO ordering

This primitive has been renamed, but because it was spelled incorrectly in the
first place it must have escaped the fixup patch.  As far as I can tell this
logic is still correct: smp_mb__after_spinlock() uses the default smp_mb()
implementation, which is "sync" rather than "hwsync" but those are the same
(though I'm not that familiar with PowerPC).
