perf tools: Rename 'enum dso_kernel_type' to 'enum dso_space_type'

Rename enum dso_kernel_type to enum dso_space_type, which seems like
better fit.

Committer notes:

This is used with 'struct dso'->kernel, which once was a boolean, so
DSO_SPACE__USER is zero, !zero means some sort of kernel space, be it
the host kernel space or a guest kernel space.
