powerpc/powernv/pci: Initialise M64 for IODA1 as a 1-1 window

We pre-configure the m64 window for IODA1 as a 1-1 segment-PE mapping,
similar to PHB3. Currently the actual mapping of segments occurs in
pnv_ioda_pick_m64_pe(), but we can move it into pnv_ioda1_init_m64() and
drop the IODA1 specific code paths in the PE setup / teardown.
