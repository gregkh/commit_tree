ASoC: Intel: skl_hda_dsp_generic: Fix NULLptr dereference in autosuspend delay

Different modules for HDMI codec are used depending on the
"hda_codec_use_common_hdmi" option being enabled or not. Driver private
context for both of them is different.
This leads to null-pointer dereference error when driver tries to set
autosuspend delay for HDMI codec while the option is off (hdac_hdmi
module is used for HDMI).

Change the string in conditional statement to "ehdaudio0D0" to ensure
that only the HDAudio codec is handled by this function.
