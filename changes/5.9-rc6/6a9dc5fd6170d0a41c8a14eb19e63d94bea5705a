lib: Revert use of fallthrough pseudo-keyword in lib/

The following build error for powerpc64 was reported by Nathan Chancellor:

  "$ scripts/config --file arch/powerpc/configs/powernv_defconfig -e KERNEL_XZ

   $ make -skj"$(nproc)" ARCH=powerpc CROSS_COMPILE=powerpc64le-linux- distclean powernv_defconfig zImage
   ...
   In file included from arch/powerpc/boot/../../../lib/decompress_unxz.c:234,
                    from arch/powerpc/boot/decompress.c:38:
   arch/powerpc/boot/../../../lib/xz/xz_dec_stream.c: In function 'dec_main':
   arch/powerpc/boot/../../../lib/xz/xz_dec_stream.c:586:4: error: 'fallthrough' undeclared (first use in this function)
     586 |    fallthrough;
         |    ^~~~~~~~~~~

   This will end up affecting distribution configurations such as Debian
   and OpenSUSE according to my testing. I am not sure what the solution
   is, the PowerPC wrapper does not set -D__KERNEL__ so I am not sure
   that compiler_attributes.h can be safely included."

In order to avoid these sort of problems, it seems that the best
solution is to use /* fall through */ comments instead of the
fallthrough pseudo-keyword macro in lib/, for now.
