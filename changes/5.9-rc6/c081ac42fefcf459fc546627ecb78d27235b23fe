usb: typec: tcpci: Support BIST test data mode for compliance.

Quoting from TCPCI spec:
"Setting this bit to 1 is intended to be used only when a USB compliance
tester is using USB BIST Test Data to test the PHY layer of the TCPC. The
TCPM should clear this bit when a disconnect is detected.
0: Normal Operation. Incoming messages enabled by RECEIVE_DETECT
passed to TCPM via Alert.
1: BIST Test Mode. Incoming messages enabled by RECEIVE_DETECT
result in GoodCRC response but may not be passed to the TCPM via
Alert."
