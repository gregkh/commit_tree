fs/minix: remove expected error message in block_to_path()

When truncating a file to a size within the last allowed logical block,
block_to_path() is called with the *next* block.  This exceeds the limit,
causing the "block %ld too big" error message to be printed.

This case isn't actually an error; there are just no more blocks past that
point.  So, remove this error message.
