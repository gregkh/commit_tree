thermal: Rename set_mode() to change_mode()

set_mode() is only called when tzd's mode is about to change. Actual
setting is performed in thermal_core, in thermal_zone_device_set_mode().
The meaning of set_mode() callback is actually to notify the driver about
the mode being changed and giving the driver a chance to oppose such
change.

To better reflect the purpose of the method rename it to change_mode()
