tmpfs: restore functionality of nr_inodes=0

Commit e809d5f0b5c9 ("tmpfs: per-superblock i_ino support") made changes
to shmem_reserve_inode() in mm/shmem.c, however the original test for
(sbinfo->max_inodes) got dropped.  This causes mounting tmpfs with option
nr_inodes=0 to fail:

  # mount -ttmpfs -onr_inodes=0 none /ext0
  mount: /ext0: mount(2) system call failed: Cannot allocate memory.

This patch restores the nr_inodes=0 functionality.
