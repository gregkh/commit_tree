netlabel: fix problems with mapping removal

This patch fixes two main problems seen when removing NetLabel
mappings: memory leaks and potentially extra audit noise.

The memory leaks are caused by not properly free'ing the mapping's
address selector struct when free'ing the entire entry as well as
not properly cleaning up a temporary mapping entry when adding new
address selectors to an existing entry.  This patch fixes both these
problems such that kmemleak reports no NetLabel associated leaks
after running the SELinux test suite.

The potentially extra audit noise was caused by the auditing code in
netlbl_domhsh_remove_entry() being called regardless of the entry's
validity.  If another thread had already marked the entry as invalid,
but not removed/free'd it from the list of mappings, then it was
possible that an additional mapping removal audit record would be
generated.  This patch fixes this by returning early from the removal
function when the entry was previously marked invalid.  This change
also had the side benefit of improving the code by decreasing the
indentation level of large chunk of code by one (accounting for most
of the diffstat).
