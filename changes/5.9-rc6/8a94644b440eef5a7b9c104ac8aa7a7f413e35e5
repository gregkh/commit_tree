PCI: Fix pci_create_slot() reference count leak

kobject_init_and_add() takes a reference even when it fails.  If it returns
an error, kobject_put() must be called to clean up the memory associated
with the object.

When kobject_init_and_add() fails, call kobject_put() instead of kfree().

b8eb718348b8 ("net-sysfs: Fix reference count leak in
rx|netdev_queue_add_kobject") fixed a similar problem.
