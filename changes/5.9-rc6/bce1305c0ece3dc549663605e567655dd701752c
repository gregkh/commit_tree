HID: core: Correctly handle ReportSize being zero

It appears that a ReportSize value of zero is legal, even if a bit
non-sensical. Most of the HID code seems to handle that gracefully,
except when computing the total size in bytes. When fed as input to
memset, this leads to some funky outcomes.

Detect the corner case and correctly compute the size.
