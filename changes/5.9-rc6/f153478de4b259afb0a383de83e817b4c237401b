drm/i915/tgl+: Use the correct DP_TP_* register instances in MST encoders

MST encoders must use the master MST transcoder's DP_TP_STATUS and
DP_TP_CONTROL registers. Atm, during the HW readout of an MST encoder
connected to a slave transcoder we reset these register addresses in
intel_dp::regs.dp_tp_* to the slave transcoder's DP_TP_* register
addresses incorrectly; fix this.

One example where the above overwite happens is the encoder HW state
validation after enabling multiple streams; see
intel_dp_mst_enc_get_config(). After that during disabling any stream
we'll get a

'Timed out waiting for ACT sent when disabling'

error, due to reading from the incorrect DP_TP_STATUS register.

This change replaces

which just papered over the problem.

v2:
- Correct the failure scenario in the commit log. (José)
