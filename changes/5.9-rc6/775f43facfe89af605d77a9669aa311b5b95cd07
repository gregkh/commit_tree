Drivers: hv: vmbus: Remove the lock field from the vmbus_channel struct

The spinlock is (now) *not used to protect test-and-set accesses
to attributes of the structure or sc_list operations.

There is, AFAICT, a distinct lack of {WRITE,READ}_ONCE()s in the
handling of channel->state, but the changes below do not seem to
make things "worse".  ;-)
