drm/edid: Allow looking for ext blocks starting from a specified index

Apparently EDIDs with multiple DispID ext blocks is a thing, so prepare
for iterating through multiple ext blocks of the same type by
passing the starting ext block index to drm_find_edid_extension(). Well
also have drm_find_edid_extension() update the index to point to the
next ext block on success. Thus we should be able to call
drm_find_edid_extension() in loop.
