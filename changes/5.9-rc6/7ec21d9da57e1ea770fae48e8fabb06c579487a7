KVM: PPC: Clean up redundant kvm_run parameters in assembly

In the current kvm version, 'kvm_run' has been included in the 'kvm_vcpu'
structure. For historical reasons, many kvm-related function parameters
retain the 'kvm_run' and 'kvm_vcpu' parameters at the same time. This
patch does a unified cleanup of these remaining redundant parameters.
