perf metric: Do not free metric when failed to resolve

It's dangerous to free the original metric when it's called from
resolve_metric() as it's already in the metric_list and might have other
resources too.  Instead, it'd better let them bail out and be released
properly at the later stage.

So add a check when it's called from metricgroup__add_metric() and
release it.  Also make sure that mp is set properly.
