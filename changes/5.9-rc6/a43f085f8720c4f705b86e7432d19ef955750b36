block: remove unnecessary ioc nested locking

The legacy CFQ IO scheduler could call put_io_context() in its exit_icq()
elevator callback. This led to a lockdep warning, which was fixed in
commit d8c66c5d5924 ("block: fix lockdep warning on io_context release
put_io_context()") by using a nested subclass for the ioc spinlock.
However, with commit f382fb0bcef4 ("block: remove legacy IO schedulers")
the CFQ IO scheduler no longer exists.

The BFQ IO scheduler also implements the exit_icq() elevator callback but
does not call put_io_context().

The nested subclass for the ioc spinlock is no longer needed. Since it
existed as an exception and no longer applies, remove the nested subclass
usage.
