selftests/livepatch: Don't clear dmesg when running tests

Inspired by commit f131d9edc29d ("selftests/lkdtm: Don't clear dmesg
when running tests"), keep a reference dmesg copy when beginning each
test.  This way check_result() can compare against the initial copy
rather than relying upon an empty log.
