sched: Micro optimization in pick_next_task() and in check_preempt_curr()

This introduces an optimization based on xxx_sched_class addresses
in two hot scheduler functions: pick_next_task() and check_preempt_curr().

It is possible to compare pointers to sched classes to check, which
of them has a higher priority, instead of current iterations using
for_each_class().

One more result of the patch is that size of object file becomes a little
less (excluding added BUG_ON(), which goes in __init section):

$size kernel/sched/core.o
         text     data      bss	    dec	    hex	filename
before:  66446    18957	    676	  86079	  1503f	kernel/sched/core.o
after:   66398    18957	    676	  86031	  1500f	kernel/sched/core.o
