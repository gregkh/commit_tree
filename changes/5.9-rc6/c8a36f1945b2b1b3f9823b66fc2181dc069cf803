bpf: xdp: Fix XDP mode when no mode flags specified

7f0a838254bd ("bpf, xdp: Maintain info on attached XDP BPF programs in net_device")
inadvertently changed which XDP mode is assumed when no mode flags are
specified explicitly. Previously, driver mode was preferred, if driver
supported it. If not, generic SKB mode was chosen. That commit changed default
to SKB mode always. This patch fixes the issue and restores the original
logic.
