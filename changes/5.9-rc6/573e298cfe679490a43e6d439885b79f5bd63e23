media: ti-vpe: cal: Split CAMERARX syscon regmap retrieval to a function

Simplify the cal_probe() function by splitting the CAMERARX syscon
regmap retrieval to a separate function. A few local variables are
renamed in the process to shorten them (syscon_camerrx_*) or to make
them more accurate (parent isn't the parent OF node but the CAL device's
own OF node).
