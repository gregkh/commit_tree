btrfs: tracepoints: move FLUSH_ACTIONS define

Since all enums used in btrfs' tracepoints are going to be redefined
to allow proper parsing of their values by userspace tools let's
rearrange when they are defined. This will allow to use only a single
set of #define EM/#undef EM sequence. No functional changes.
