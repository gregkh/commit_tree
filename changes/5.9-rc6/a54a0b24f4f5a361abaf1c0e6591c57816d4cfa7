ice: restore VF MSI-X state during PCI reset

During a PCI FLR the MSI-X Enable flag in the VF PCI MSI-X capability
register will be cleared. This can lead to issues when a VF is
assigned to a VM because in these cases the VF driver receives no
indication of the PF PCI error/reset and additionally it is incapable
of restoring the cleared flag in the hypervisor configuration space
without fully reinitializing the driver interrupt functionality.

Since the VF driver is unable to easily resolve this condition on its own,
restore the VF MSI-X flag during the PF PCI reset handling.
