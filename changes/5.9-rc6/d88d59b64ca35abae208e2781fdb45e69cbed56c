core/entry: Respect syscall number rewrites

The transcript of the x86 entry code to the generic version failed to
reload the syscall number from ptregs after ptrace and seccomp have run,
which both can modify the syscall number in ptregs. It returns the original
syscall number instead which is obviously not the right thing to do.

Reload the syscall number to fix that.
