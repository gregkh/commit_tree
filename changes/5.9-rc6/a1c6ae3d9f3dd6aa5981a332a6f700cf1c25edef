md/raid5: Fix Force reconstruct-write io stuck in degraded raid5

In degraded raid5, we need to read parity to do reconstruct-write when
data disks fail. However, we can not read parity from
handle_stripe_dirtying() in force reconstruct-write mode.

Reproducible Steps:

1. Create degraded raid5
mdadm -C /dev/md2 --assume-clean -l5 -n3 /dev/sda2 /dev/sdb2 missing
2. Set rmw_level to 0
echo 0 > /sys/block/md2/md/rmw_level
3. IO to raid5

Now some io may be stuck in raid5. We can use handle_stripe_fill() to read
the parity in this situation.
