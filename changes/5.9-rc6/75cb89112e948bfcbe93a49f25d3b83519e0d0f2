drm/amd/display: Fixed using wrong eDP power sequence function pointer

[why]
dc->hwss->edp_backlight_control is null, it would casue it only be off
main-link of eDP.  It is not worng behavior for eDP power sequence off.

[how]
Must use hwseq->funcs.edp_backlight_control finction pointer for edp
backlight.
