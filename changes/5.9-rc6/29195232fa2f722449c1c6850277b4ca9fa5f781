crc-t10dif: clean up some more things

- Correctly compare the algorithm name in crc_t10dif_notify().

- Use proper NOTIFY_* status codes instead of 0.

- Consistently use CRC_T10DIF_STRING instead of "crct10dif" directly.

- Use a proper type for the shash_desc context.

- Use crypto_shash_driver_name() instead of open-coding it.

- Make crc_t10dif_transform_show() use snprintf() rather than sprintf().
  This isn't actually necessary since the buffer has size PAGE_SIZE
  and CRYPTO_MAX_ALG_NAME < PAGE_SIZE, but it's good practice.

- Give the "transform" sysfs file mode 0444 rather than 0644,
  since it doesn't implement a setter method.

- Adjust the module description to not be the same as crct10dif-generic.
