l2tp: line-break long function prototypes

In l2tp_core.c both l2tp_tunnel_create and l2tp_session_create take
quite a number of arguments and have a correspondingly long prototype.

This is both quite difficult to scan visually, and triggers checkpatch
warnings.

Add a line break to make these function prototypes more readable.
