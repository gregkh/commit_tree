iio:accel:mma8452: Fix timestamp alignment and prevent data leak.

One of a class of bugs pointed out by Lars in a recent review.
iio_push_to_buffers_with_timestamp assumes the buffer used is aligned
to the size of the timestamp (8 bytes).  This is not guaranteed in
this driver which uses a 16 byte u8 array on the stack.  As Lars also noted
this anti pattern can involve a leak of data to userspace and that
indeed can happen here.  We close both issues by moving to
a suitable structure in the iio_priv() data with alignment
ensured by use of an explicit c structure.  This data is allocated
with kzalloc so no data can leak appart from previous readings.

The additional forcing of the 8 byte alignment of the timestamp
is not strictly necessary but makes the code less fragile by
making this explicit.
