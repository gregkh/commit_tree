qed: fix assignment of n_rq_elems to incorrect params field

Currently n_rq_elems is being assigned to params.elem_size instead of the
field params.num_elems.  Coverity is detecting this as a double assingment
to params.elem_size and reporting this as an usused value on the first
assignment.  Fix this.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unused value")
