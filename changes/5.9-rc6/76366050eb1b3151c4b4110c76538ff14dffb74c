x86/defconfigs: Explicitly unset CONFIG_64BIT in i386_defconfig

A recent refresh of the defconfigs got rid of the following
(unset) config:

  # CONFIG_64BIT is not set

Innocuous as it seems, when the config file is saved again the
behavior is changed so that CONFIG_64BIT=y.

Currently,

  $ make i386_defconfig
  $ grep CONFIG_64BIT .config
  CONFIG_64BIT=y

whereas previously (and with this patch):

  $ make i386_defconfig
  $ grep CONFIG_64BIT .config
  # CONFIG_64BIT is not set

( This was found with weird compiler errors on OpenEmbedded
  builds, as the compiler was unable to cope with 64-bits data
  types. )
