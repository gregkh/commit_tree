misc: habanalabs: irq: Repair kerneldoc formatting issues

W=1 kernel builds report a lack of descriptions for various
function arguments.  In reality they are documented, but the
formatting was not as expected '@.*:'.  Instead, '-'s were
used as separators.

While we're here, the headers for functions various functions
were written in kerneldoc format, but lack the kerneldoc
identifier '/**'.  Let's promote them so they can gain access
to the checker.

This change fixes the following W=1 warnings:

 drivers/misc/habanalabs/irq.c:24: warning: Function parameter or member 'eq_work' not described in 'hl_eqe_work'
 drivers/misc/habanalabs/irq.c:24: warning: Function parameter or member 'hdev' not described in 'hl_eqe_work'
 drivers/misc/habanalabs/irq.c:24: warning: Function parameter or member 'eq_entry' not described in 'hl_eqe_work'
