net: phy: clean up get_phy_c45_ids() failure handling

When we decide that a PHY is not present, we do not need to go through
the hoops of setting *phy_id to 0xffffffff, and then return zero to
make get_phy_device() fail - we can return -ENODEV which will have the
same effect.

Doing so means we no longer have to pass a pointer to phy_id in, and
we can then clean up the clause 22 path in a similar way.
