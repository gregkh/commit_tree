usb: typec: tcpm: Refactor tcpm_handle_vdm_request payload handling

Refactor the tcpm_handle_vdm_request payload handling by doing the
endianness conversion only once directly inside tcpm_handle_vdm_request
itself instead of doing it multiple times inside various helper functions
called by tcpm_handle_vdm_request.

This is a preparation patch for some further refactoring to fix an AB BA
lock inversion between the tcpm code and some altmode drivers.
