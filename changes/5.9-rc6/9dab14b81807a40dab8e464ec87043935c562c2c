io_uring: don't use poll handler if file can't be nonblocking read/written

There's no point in using the poll handler if we can't do a nonblocking
IO attempt of the operation, since we'll need to go async anyway. In
fact this is actively harmful, as reading from eg pipes won't return 0
to indicate EOF.
