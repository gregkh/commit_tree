gpiolib: move gpiolib-sysfs function declarations into their own header

Move gpiolib-sysfs function declarations into their own header.

These functions are in gpiolib-sysfs.c, and are only required by gpiolib.c,
and so should be in a module header, not gpiolib.h.

This brings gpiolib-sysfs into line with gpiolib-cdev, and is another step
towards removing the sysfs inferface.
