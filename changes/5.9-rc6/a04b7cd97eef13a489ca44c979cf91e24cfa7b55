habanalabs: create internal CB pool

Create a device MMU-mapped internal command buffer pool, in order to allow
the driver to allocate CBs for the signal/wait operations
that are fetched by the queues when they are configured with the user's
address space ID.

We must pre-map this internal pool due to performance issues.

This pool is needed for future ASIC support and it is currently unused in
GOYA and GAUDI.
