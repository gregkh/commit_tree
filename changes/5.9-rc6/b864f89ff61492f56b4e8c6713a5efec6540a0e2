refperf: Tune reader measurement interval

This commit moves a printk() out of the measurement interval, converts
a atomic_dec()/atomic_read() pair to atomic_dec_and_test(), and adds
a smp_mb__before_atomic() to avoid potential wake/wait hangs.  These
changes have the added benefit of reducing the number of loops required
for amortizing loop overhead for CONFIG_PREEMPT=n RCU measurements from
1,000,000 to 10,000.  This reduction in turn shortens the test, reducing
the probability of interference.
