net: qed: sanitize BE/LE data processing

Current code assumes that both host and device operates in Little Endian
in lots of places. While this is true for x86 platform, this doesn't mean
we should not care about this.

This commit addresses all parts of the code that were pointed out by sparse
checker. All operations with restricted (__be*/__le*) types are now
protected with explicit from/to CPU conversions, even if they're noops on
common setups.

I'm sure there are more such places, but this implies a deeper code
investigation, and is a subject for future works.
