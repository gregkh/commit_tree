lib/vsprintf: Force type of flags value for gfp_t

Sparse is not happy about restricted type being assigned:
  lib/vsprintf.c:1940:23: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
  lib/vsprintf.c:1940:23:    expected unsigned long [assigned] flags
  lib/vsprintf.c:1940:23:    got restricted gfp_t [usertype]

Force type of flags value to make sparse happy.
