sched/fair: Merge select_idle_core/cpu()

Both select_idle_core() and select_idle_cpu() do a loop over the same
cpumask. Observe that by clearing the already visited CPUs, we can
fold the iteration and iterate a core at a time.

All we need to do is remember any non-idle CPU we encountered while
scanning for an idle core. This way we'll only iterate every CPU once.
