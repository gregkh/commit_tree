fs/buffer.c: add checking buffer head stat before clear

clear_buffer_new() is used to clear buffer new stat.  When PAGE_SIZE is
64K, most buffer heads in the list are not needed to clear.
clear_buffer_new() has an enpensive atomic modification operation, Let's
add checking buffer head before clear it as __block_write_begin_int does
which is good for performance.
