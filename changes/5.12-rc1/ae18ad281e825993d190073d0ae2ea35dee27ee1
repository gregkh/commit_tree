sched: Remove MAX_USER_RT_PRIO

Commit d46523ea32a7 ("[PATCH] fix MAX_USER_RT_PRIO and MAX_RT_PRIO")
was introduced due to a a small time period in which the realtime patch
set was using different values for MAX_USER_RT_PRIO and MAX_RT_PRIO.

This is no longer true, i.e. now MAX_RT_PRIO == MAX_USER_RT_PRIO.

Get rid of MAX_USER_RT_PRIO and make everything use MAX_RT_PRIO
instead.
