drm/i915: Fix ICL MG PHY vswing handling

The MH PHY vswing table does have all the entries these days. Get
rid of the old hacks in the code which claim otherwise.

This hack was totally bogus anyway. The correct way to handle the
lack of those two entries would have been to declare our max
vswing and pre-emph to both be level 2.
