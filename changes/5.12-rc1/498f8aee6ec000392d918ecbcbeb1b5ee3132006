ARM: dts: imx6: RDU2: adjust audio devices nomenclature

This adds a "HPA1" prefix to the amplifiers on both audio cards, this is
done in order to get more consistency for userspace running on RDU2 and
RDU3, where we have two amplifiers on a single card device in the "Zest"
configuration.

Also adjust the card names to the new standard expected by userspace.
