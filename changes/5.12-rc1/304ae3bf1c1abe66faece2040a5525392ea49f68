net: bridge: offload all port flags at once in br_setport

If for example this command:

ip link set swp0 type bridge_slave flood off mcast_flood off learning off

succeeded at configuring BR_FLOOD and BR_MCAST_FLOOD but not at
BR_LEARNING, there would be no attempt to revert the partial state in
any way. Arguably, if the user changes more than one flag through the
same netlink command, this one _should_ be all or nothing, which means
it should be passed through switchdev as all or nothing.
