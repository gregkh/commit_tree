powerpc: remove arguments from fault handler functions

Make mm fault handlers all just take the pt_regs * argument and load
DAR/DSISR from that. Make those that return a value return long.

This is done to make the function signatures match other handlers, which
will help with a future patch to add wrappers. Explicit arguments could
be added for performance but that would require more wrapper macro
variants.
