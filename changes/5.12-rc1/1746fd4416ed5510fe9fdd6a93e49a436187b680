tracepoints: Remove unnecessary "data_args" macro parameter

While working on a clean up that would restructure the difference between
architectures that have static calls vs those that do not, I was stumbling
over the "data_args" parameter that includes "__data" in the arguments. The
issue was that one version didn't even need it, while the other one did.
Instead of injecting a "__data = NULL;" into the macro for the unneeded
version, just remove it completely.

The original idea behind data_args is that there may be a case of a
tracepoint with no arguments. But this is considered bad practice, and all
tracepoints should pass something to that location (that's what tracepoints
were created for).
