xhci: Add xhci_reset_halted_ep() helper function

Create a separate helper function to issue reset endpont commands
to clear halted endpoints.

This is useful for cases where a halted endpoint is discovered while
completing another command, and the endpoint halt needs to be cleared
with a endpoint reset first.
