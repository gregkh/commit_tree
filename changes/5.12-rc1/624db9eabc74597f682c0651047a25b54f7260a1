x86: Select CONFIG_HAVE_IRQ_EXIT_ON_IRQ_STACK

Now that all invocations of irq_exit_rcu() happen on the irq stack, turn on
CONFIG_HAVE_IRQ_EXIT_ON_IRQ_STACK which causes the core code to invoke
__do_softirq() directly without going through do_softirq_own_stack().

That means do_softirq_own_stack() is only invoked from task context which
means it can't be on the irq stack. Remove the conditional from
run_softirq_on_irqstack_cond() and rename the function accordingly.
