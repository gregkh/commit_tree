drm/i915/selftests: Rearrange ktime_get to reduce latency against CS

In our tests where we measure the elapsed time on both the CPU and CS
using a udelay, our CS results match the udelay much more accurately
than the ktime (even when using ktime_get_fast_ns). With preemption
disabled, we can go one step lower than ktime and use local_clock.
