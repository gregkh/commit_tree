bnxt_en: handle CRASH_NO_MASTER during bnxt_open()

Add missing support for handling NO_MASTER crashes while ports are
administratively down (ifdown). On some SoC platforms, the driver
needs to assist the firmware to recover from a crash via OP-TEE.
This is performed in a similar fashion to what is done during driver
probe.
