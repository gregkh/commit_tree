gpio: pcf857x: Fix missing first interrupt

If no n_latch value will be provided at driver probe then all pins will
be used as an input:

    gpio->out = ~n_latch;

In that case initial state for all pins is "one":

    gpio->status = gpio->out;

So if pcf857x IRQ happens with change pin value from "zero" to "one"
then we miss it, because of "one" from IRQ and "one" from initial state
leaves corresponding pin unchanged:
change = (gpio->status ^ status) & gpio->irq_enabled;

The right solution will be to read actual state at driver probe.
