objtool: Support retpoline jump detection for vmlinux.o

Objtool converts direct retpoline jumps to type INSN_JUMP_DYNAMIC, since
that's what they are semantically.

That conversion doesn't work in vmlinux.o validation because the
indirect thunk function is present in the object, so the intra-object
jump check succeeds before the retpoline jump check gets a chance.

Rearrange the checks: check for a retpoline jump before checking for an
intra-object jump.
