arm64: dts: hisilicon: hikey970-pinctrl.dtsi: add missing pinctrl settings

There are several pinctrl settings that are missing at this
DT file.

Also, the entries are out of order.

Add the missing bits, as they'll be required by the DRM driver - and
probably by other drivers not upstreamed yet.

Reorder the entres, adding the missing bits.
