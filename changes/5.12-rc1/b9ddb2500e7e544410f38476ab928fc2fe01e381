hwspinlock: omap: Add support for K3 AM64x SoCs

The AM64x SoC contains a HwSpinlock IP instance in the MAIN domain,
and is a minor variant of the IP on the current TI K3 SoCs such as
AM64x, J721E or J7200 SoCs. The IP is not built with the K3 safety
feature in hardware, and has slightly different integration into
the overall SoC.

Add the support for this IP through a new compatible.
