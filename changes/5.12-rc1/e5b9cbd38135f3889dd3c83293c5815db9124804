drm/i915/dsc: configure hardware using specified rc_model_size

The rc_model_size is specified in the DSC config, and the hardware
programming should respect that instead of hard coding a value of 8192.

Regardless, the rc_model_size in DSC config is currently hard coded to
the same value, so this should have no impact, other than allowing the
use of other sizes as needed.
