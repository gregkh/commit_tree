dt-bindings: nvmem: Add bindings for rmem driver

Firmware/co-processors might use reserved memory areas in order to pass
data stemming from an nvmem device otherwise non accessible to Linux.
For example an EEPROM memory only physically accessible to firmware, or
data only accessible early at boot time.

Introduce the dt-bindings to nvmem's rmem.
