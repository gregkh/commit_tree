objtool: Fix retpoline detection in asm code

The JMP_NOSPEC macro branches to __x86_retpoline_*() rather than the
__x86_indirect_thunk_*() wrappers used by C code.  Detect jumps to
__x86_retpoline_*() as retpoline dynamic jumps.

Presumably this doesn't trigger a user-visible bug.  I only found it
when testing vmlinux.o validation.
