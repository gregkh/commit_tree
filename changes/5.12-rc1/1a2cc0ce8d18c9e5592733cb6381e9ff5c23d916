io_uring: further simplify do_read error parsing

First, instead of checking iov_iter_count(iter) for 0 to find out that
all needed bytes were read, just compare returned code against io_size.
It's more reliable and arguably cleaner.

Also, place the half-read case into an else branch and delete an extra
label.
