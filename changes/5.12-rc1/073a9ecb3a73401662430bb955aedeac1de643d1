init/version.c: remove Version_<LINUX_VERSION_CODE> symbol

This code hunk creates a Version_<LINUX_VERSION_CODE> symbol if
CONFIG_KALLSYMS is disabled.  For example, building the kernel v5.10 for
allnoconfig creates the following symbol:

  $ nm vmlinux | grep Version_
  c116b028 B Version_330240

There is no in-tree user of this symbol.

Commit 197dcffc8ba0 ("init/version.c: define version_string only if
CONFIG_KALLSYMS is not defined") mentions that Version_* is only used
with ksymoops.

However, a commit in the pre-git era [1] had added the statement,
"ksymoops is useless on 2.6.  Please use the Oops in its original format".

That statement existed until commit 4eb9241127a0 ("Documentation:
admin-guide: update bug-hunting.rst") finally removed the stale
ksymoops information.

This symbol is no longer needed.
