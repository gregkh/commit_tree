iwlwifi: mvm: fix the type we use in the PPAG table validity checks

The value we receive from ACPI is a long long unsigned integer but the
values should be treated as signed char.  When comparing the received
value with ACPI_PPAG_MIN_LB/HB, we were doing an unsigned comparison,
so the negative value would actually be treated as a very high number.

To solve this issue, assign the value to our table of s8's before
making the comparison, so the value is already converted when we do
so.
