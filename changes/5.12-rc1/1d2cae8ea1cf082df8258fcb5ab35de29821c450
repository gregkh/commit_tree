mm/page_owner: use helper function zone_end_pfn() to get end_pfn

Commit 108bcc96ef70 ("mm: add & use zone_end_pfn() and zone_spans_pfn()")
introduced the helper zone_end_pfn() to calculate the zone end pfn.  But
pagetypeinfo_showmixedcount_print forgot to use it.  And the
initialization of local variable pfn is duplicated, remove one.
