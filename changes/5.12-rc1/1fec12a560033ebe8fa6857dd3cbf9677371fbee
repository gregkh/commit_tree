btrfs: noinline btrfs_should_cancel_balance

I was attempting to reproduce a problem that Zygo hit, but my error
injection wasn't firing for a few of the common calls to
btrfs_should_cancel_balance.  This is because the compiler decided to
inline it at these spots.  Keep this from happening by explicitly
marking the function as noinline so that error injection will always
work.
