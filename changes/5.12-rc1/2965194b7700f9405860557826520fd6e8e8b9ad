btrfs: remove wrong comment for can_nocow_extent()

The comment for can_nocow_extent() says that the function will flush
ordered extents, however that never happens and was never true before the
comment was added in commit e4ecaf90bc13 ("btrfs: add comments for
btrfs_check_can_nocow() and can_nocow_extent()"). This is true only for
the function btrfs_check_can_nocow(), which after that commit was renamed
to check_can_nocow(). So just remove that part of the comment.
