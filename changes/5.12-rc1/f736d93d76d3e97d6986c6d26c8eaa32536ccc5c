xfs: support idmapped mounts

Enable idmapped mounts for xfs. This basically just means passing down
the user_namespace argument from the VFS methods down to where it is
passed to the relevant helpers.

Note that full-filesystem bulkstat is not supported from inside idmapped
mounts as it is an administrative operation that acts on the whole file
system. The limitation is not applied to the bulkstat single operation
that just operates on a single inode.
