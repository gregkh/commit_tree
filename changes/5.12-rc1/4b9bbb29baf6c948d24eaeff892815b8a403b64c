driver core: Add device link support for INFERRED flag

This flag can never be added to a device link that already exists and
doesn't have the flag set. It can only be added when a device link is
created for the first time or it can be maintained if the device link
already has the it set.

This flag will be used for marking device links created ONLY by
inferring dependencies from data and NOT from explicit action by device
drivers/frameworks.  This will be useful in the future when we need to
deal with cycles in dependencies inferred from firmware.
