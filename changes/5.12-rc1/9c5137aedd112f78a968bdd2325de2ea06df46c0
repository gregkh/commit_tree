virt: acrn: Introduce VM management interfaces

The VM management interfaces expose several VM operations to ACRN
userspace via ioctls. For example, creating VM, starting VM, destroying
VM and so on.

The ACRN Hypervisor needs to exchange data with the ACRN userspace
during the VM operations. HSM provides VM operation ioctls to the ACRN
userspace and communicates with the ACRN Hypervisor for VM operations
via hypercalls.

HSM maintains a list of User VM. Each User VM will be bound to an
existing file descriptor of /dev/acrn_hsm. The User VM will be
destroyed when the file descriptor is closed.
