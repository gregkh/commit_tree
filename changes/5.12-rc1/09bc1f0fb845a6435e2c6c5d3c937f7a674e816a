btrfs: attach private to dummy extent buffer pages

There are locations where we allocate dummy extent buffers for temporary
usage, like in tree_mod_log_rewind() or get_old_root().

These dummy extent buffers will be handled by the same eb accessors, and
if they don't have page::private subpage eb accessors could fail.

To address such problems, make __alloc_dummy_extent_buffer() attach
page private for dummy extent buffers too.
