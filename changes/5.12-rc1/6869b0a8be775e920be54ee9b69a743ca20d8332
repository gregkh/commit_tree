btrfs: merge PAGE_CLEAR_DIRTY and PAGE_SET_WRITEBACK to PAGE_START_WRITEBACK

PAGE_CLEAR_DIRTY and PAGE_SET_WRITEBACK are two defines used in
__process_pages_contig(), to let the function know to clear page dirty
bit and then set page writeback.

However page writeback and dirty bits are conflicting (at least for
sector size == PAGE_SIZE case), this means these two have to be always
updated together.

This means we can merge PAGE_CLEAR_DIRTY and PAGE_SET_WRITEBACK to
PAGE_START_WRITEBACK.
