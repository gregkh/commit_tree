mm/memory_hotplug: use helper function zone_end_pfn() to get end_pfn

Commit 108bcc96ef70 ("mm: add & use zone_end_pfn() and zone_spans_pfn()")
introduced the helper zone_end_pfn() to calculate the zone end pfn.  But
update_pgdat_span() forgot to use it.

Use this helper and rename local variable zone_end_pfn to end_pfn to avoid
a naming conflict with the existing zone_end_pfn().
