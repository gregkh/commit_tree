acpi/drivers/thermal: Remove TRIPS_NONE cooling device binding

The loop is here to create default cooling device binding on the
THERMAL_TRIPS_NONE number which is used to be the 'forced_passive'
feature. However, we removed all code dealing with that in the thermal
core, thus this binding does no longer make sense.

Remove it.
