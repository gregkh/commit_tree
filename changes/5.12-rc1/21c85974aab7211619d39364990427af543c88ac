net/packet: Improve the comment about LL header visibility criteria

The "dev_has_header" function, recently added in
commit d549699048b4 ("net/packet: fix packet receive on L3 devices
without visible hard header"),
is more accurate as criteria for determining whether a device exposes
the LL header to upper layers, because in addition to dev->header_ops,
it also checks for dev->header_ops->create.

When transmitting an skb on a device, dev_hard_header can be called to
generate an LL header. dev_hard_header will only generate a header if
dev->header_ops->create is present.
