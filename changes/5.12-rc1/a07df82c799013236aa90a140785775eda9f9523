ALSA: usb-audio: Add DJM750 to Pioneer mixer quirk

This allows for N different devices to use the pioneer mixer quirk for
setting capture/record type and recording level. The impementation has
not changed much with the exception of an additional mask on
private_value to allow storing of a device index:
	DEVICE MASK	0xff000000
	GROUP_MASK	0x00ff0000
	VALUE_MASK	0x0000ffff

This could be improved by changing the arrays of wValues for each
channel to contain named definitions (e.g. SND_DJM_CAP_LINE). It would
improve readability and perhaps would allow using the same array for
multiple channels. The channel number can be specified on the control
next to the wIndex.

Feedback is very much appreciated as I'm not the most proficient C
programmer but am learning as I go.
