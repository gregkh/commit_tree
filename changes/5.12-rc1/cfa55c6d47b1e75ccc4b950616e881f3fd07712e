batman-adv: Drop publication years from copyright info

The batman-adv source code was using the year of publication (to net-next)
as "last" year for the copyright statement. The whole source code mentioned
in the MAINTAINERS "BATMAN ADVANCED" section was handled as a single entity
regarding the publishing year.

This avoided having outdated (in sense of year information - not copyright
holder) publishing information inside several files. But since the simple
"update copyright year" commit (without other changes) in the file was not
well received in the upstream kernel, the option to not have a copyright
year (for initial and last publication) in the files are chosen instead.
More detailed information about the years can still be retrieved from the
SCM system.
