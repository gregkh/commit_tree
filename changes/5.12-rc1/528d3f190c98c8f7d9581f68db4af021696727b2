net: mscc: ocelot: drop the use of the "lags" array

We can now simplify the implementation by always using ocelot_get_bond_mask
to look up the other ports that are offloading the same bonding interface
as us.

In ocelot_set_aggr_pgids, the code had a way to uniquely iterate through
LAGs. We need to achieve the same behavior by marking each LAG as visited,
which we do now by using a temporary 32-bit "visited" bitmask. This is
ok and we do not need dynamic memory allocation, because we know that
this switch architecture will not have more than 32 ports (the PGID port
masks are 32-bit anyway).
