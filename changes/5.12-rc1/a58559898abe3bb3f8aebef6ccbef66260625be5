drm/i915/gt: Check for a completed last request once

Pull the repeated check for the last active request being completed to a
single spot, when deciding whether or not execlist preemption is
required.

In doing so, we remove the tasklet kick, introduced with the completion
checks in commit 35f3fd8182ba ("drm/i915/execlists: Workaround switching
back to a completed context"), if we find the request was completed but
have not yet seen the corresponding CS event. This was devolving into a
busy spin of the tasklet while we waited for the event as the delivery
was not as instantaneous as expected. Under load this is sufficient to
exhaust the tasklet softirq timeslice, and force ksoftirqd. Quite
noticeable overhead for no apparent improvement in latency.
