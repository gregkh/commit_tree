drm/amd/display: Fix deadlock during gpu reset v3

[Why]
during idle optimizations we acquire the dc_lock, this lock is also
acquired during gpu_reset so we end up hanging the system due to a
deadlock

[How]
If we are in gpu reset:
 - disable idle optimizations and skip calls to the dc function

v2: skip idle optimizations calls
v3: add guard for DCN
