octeontx2-af: Mailbox changes for 98xx CPT block

This patch changes CPT mailbox message format to
support new block CPT1 in 98xx silicon.

cpt_rd_wr_reg ->
    Modify cpt_rd_wr_reg mailbox and its handler to
    accommodate new block CPT1.
cpt_lf_alloc ->
    Modify cpt_lf_alloc mailbox and its handler to
    configure LFs from a block address out of multiple
    blocks of same type. If a PF/VF needs to configure
    LFs from both the blocks then this mbox should be
    called twice.
