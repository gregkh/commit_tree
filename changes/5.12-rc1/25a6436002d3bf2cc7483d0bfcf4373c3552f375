media: v4l2-async: Safely unregister an non-registered async subdev

Make the V4L2 async framework a bit more robust by allowing to
unregister a non-registered async subdev. Otherwise the
v4l2_async_cleanup() will attempt to delete the async subdev from the
subdev_list with the corresponding list_head not initialized.
