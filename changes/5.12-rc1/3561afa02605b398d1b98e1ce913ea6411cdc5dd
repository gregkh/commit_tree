mmc: core: Add helper for parsing clock phase properties

Drivers for MMC hosts that accept phase corrections can take advantage
of the helper by embedding an instance of struct mmc_clk_phase_map in
their private data and invoking mmc_of_parse_clk_phase() to extract
phase parameters. It is the responsibility of the host driver to
translate and apply the extracted values to hardware as required.
