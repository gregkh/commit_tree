bpf: Be less specific about socket cookies guarantees

Since "92acdc58ab11 bpf, net: Rework cookie generator as per-cpu one"
socket cookies are not guaranteed to be non-decreasing. The
bpf_get_socket_cookie helper descriptions are currently specifying that
cookies are non-decreasing but we don't want users to rely on that.
