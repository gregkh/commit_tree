s390: open code SWITCH_KERNEL macro

This is a preparation patch for two later bugfixes. In the past both
int_handler and machine check handler used SWITCH_KERNEL to switch to
the kernel stack. However, SWITCH_KERNEL doesn't work properly in machine
check context. So instead of adding more complexity to this macro, just
remove it.
