btrfs: extend btrfs_rmap_block for specifying a device

btrfs_rmap_block currently reverse-maps the physical addresses on all
devices to the corresponding logical addresses.

Extend the function to match to a specified device. The old functionality
of querying all devices is left intact by specifying NULL as target
device.

A block_device instead of a btrfs_device is passed into btrfs_rmap_block,
as this function is intended to reverse-map the result of a bio, which
only has a block_device.

Also export the function for later use.
