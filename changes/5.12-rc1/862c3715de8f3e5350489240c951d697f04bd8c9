iommu: Switch gather->end to the inclusive end

Currently gather->end is "unsigned long" which may be overflow in
arch32 in the corner case: 0xfff00000 + 0x100000(iova + size).
Although it doesn't affect the size(end - start), it affects the checking
"gather->end < end"

This patch changes this "end" to the real end address
(end = start + size - 1). Correspondingly, update the length to
"end - start + 1".
