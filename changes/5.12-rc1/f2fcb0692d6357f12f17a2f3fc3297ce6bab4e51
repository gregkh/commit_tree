drm/nouveau/fifo/tu102: Turing channel preemption fix

Previous hardware allowed a MMU fault to be generated by software to
trigger a context switch for engine recovery. Turing has the capability
to preempt all work from a specific runlist processor and removed the
registers currently used for triggering MMU faults. Attempting to access
these non-existent registers results in further errors, so use the
runlist preemption register instead.
