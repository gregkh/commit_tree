misc: bcm-vk: add triggers when host panic or reboots to notify card

Pass down an interrupt to card in case of panic or reboot so
that card can take appropriate action to perform a clean reset.
Uses kernel notifier block either directly (register on panic list),
or implicitly (add shutdown method for PCI device).
