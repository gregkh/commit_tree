x86/sev-es: Do not unroll string I/O for SEV-ES guests

Under the GHCB specification, SEV-ES guests can support string I/O.
The current #VC handler contains this support, so remove the need to
unroll kernel string I/O operations. This will reduce the number of #VC
exceptions generated as well as the number VM exits for the guest.
