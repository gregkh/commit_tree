media: cx25821: Fix a bug when reallocating some dma memory

This function looks like a realloc.

However, if 'risc->cpu != NULL', the memory will be freed, but never
reallocated with the bigger 'size'.
Explicitly set 'risc->cpu' to NULL, so that the reallocation is
correctly performed a few lines below.

[hverkuil: NULL != risc->cpu -> risc->cpu]
