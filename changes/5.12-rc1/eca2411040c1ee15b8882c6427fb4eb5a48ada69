powerpc/32: Always enable data translation on syscall entry

If the code can use a stack in vm area, it can also use a
stack in linear space.

Simplify code by removing old non VMAP stack code on PPC32 in syscall.

That means the data translation is now re-enabled early in
syscall entry in all cases, not only when using VMAP stacks.
