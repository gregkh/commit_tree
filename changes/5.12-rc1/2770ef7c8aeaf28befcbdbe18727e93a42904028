ia64: do not typedef struct pal_min_state_area_s

Documentation/process/coding-style.rst says:

  Please don't use things like ``vps_t``.
  It's a **mistake** to use typedef for structures and pointers.

This commit converts as follows:

  struct pal_min_state_area_s  ->  struct pal_min_state_area
         pal_min_state_area_t  ->  struct pal_min_state_area

My main motivation for this is to slim down the include directives
of <asm/mca.h> in the next commit.

Currently, <asm/mca.h> is required to include <asm/pal.h> directly
or indirectly due to (pal_min_state_area_t *). Otherwise, it would
have no idea what pal_min_state_area_t is.

Replacing it with (struct pal_min_state_area *) will relax the header
dependency since it is enough to tell it is a pointer to a structure,
and to resolve the size of struct pal_min_state_area. It will make
<asm/mca.h> independent of <asm/pal.h>.

<asm/pal.h> typedef's a lot of structures, but it is trivial to
convert the others in the same way.
