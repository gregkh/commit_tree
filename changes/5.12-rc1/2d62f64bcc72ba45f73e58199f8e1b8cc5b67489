MIPS: Fix get_frame_info() handing of function size

[1]: Commit b6c7a324df37b ("MIPS: Fix get_frame_info() handling of
                            microMIPS function size")
[2]: Commit 2b424cfc69728 ("MIPS: Remove function size check in
                            get_frame_info()")

First patch added a constant to check the number of iterations against.
Second patch fixed the situation that info->func_size is zero.

However, func_size member became useless after the second commit. Without
ip_end, the get frame_size operation may be out of range although KALLSYMS
enabled. Thus, check func_size first. Then make ip_end be the sum of ip
and a constant (512) if func_size is equal to 0. Otherwise make ip_end be
the sum of ip and func_size.
