selftests: kvm: add hardware_disable test

This test launches 512 VMs in serial and kills them after a random
amount of time.

The test was original written to exercise KVM user notifiers in
the context of1650b4ebc99d:
- KVM: Disable irq while unregistering user notifier
- https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/CACXrx53vkO=HKfwWwk+fVpvxcNjPrYmtDZ10qWxFvVX_PTGp3g@mail.gmail.com/

Recently, this test piqued my interest because it proved useful to
for AMD SNP in exercising the "in-use" pages, described in APM section
15.36.12, "Running SNP-Active Virtual Machines".
