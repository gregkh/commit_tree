net: dsa: tag_ocelot: single out PTP-related transmit tag processing

There is one place where we cannot avoid accessing driver data, and that
is 2-step PTP TX timestamping, since the switch wants us to provide a
timestamp request ID through the injection header, which naturally must
come from a sequence number kept by the driver (it is generated by the
.port_txtstamp method prior to the tagger's xmit).

However, since other drivers like dsa_loop do not claim PTP support
anyway, the DSA_SKB_CB(skb)->clone will always be NULL anyway, so if we
move all PTP-related dereferences of struct ocelot and struct ocelot_port
into a separate function, we can effectively ensure that this is dead
code when the ocelot tagger is attached to non-ocelot switches, and the
stateful portion of the tagger is more self-contained.
