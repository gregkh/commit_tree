net: mscc: ocelot: configure watermarks using devlink-sb

Using devlink-sb, we can configure 12/16 (the important 75%) of the
switch's controlling watermarks for congestion drops, and we can monitor
50% of the watermark occupancies (we can monitor the reservation
watermarks, but not the sharing watermarks, which are exposed as pool
sizes).

The following definitions can be made:

SB_BUF=0 # The devlink-sb for frame buffers
SB_REF=1 # The devlink-sb for frame references
POOL_ING=0 # The pool for ingress traffic. Both devlink-sb instances
           # have one of these.
POOL_EGR=1 # The pool for egress traffic. Both devlink-sb instances
           # have one of these.

Editing the hardware watermarks is done in the following way:
BUF_xxxx_I is accessed when sb=$SB_BUF and pool=$POOL_ING
REF_xxxx_I is accessed when sb=$SB_REF and pool=$POOL_ING
BUF_xxxx_E is accessed when sb=$SB_BUF and pool=$POOL_EGR
REF_xxxx_E is accessed when sb=$SB_REF and pool=$POOL_EGR

Configuring the sharing watermarks for COL_SHR(dp=0) is done implicitly
by modifying the corresponding pool size. By default, the pool size has
maximum size, so this can be skipped.

devlink sb pool set pci/0000:00:00.5 sb $SB_BUF pool $POOL_ING \
	size 129840 thtype static

Since by default there is no buffer reservation, the above command has
maxed out BUF_COL_SHR_I(dp=0).

Configuring the per-port reservation watermark (P_RSRV) is done in the
following way:

devlink sb port pool set pci/0000:00:00.5/0 sb $SB_BUF \
	pool $POOL_ING th 1000

The above command sets BUF_P_RSRV_I(port 0) to 1000 bytes. After this
command, the sharing watermarks are internally reconfigured with 1000
bytes less, i.e. from 129840 bytes to 128840 bytes.

Configuring the per-port-tc reservation watermarks (Q_RSRV) is done in
the following way:

for tc in {0..7}; do
	devlink sb tc bind set pci/0000:00:00.5/0 sb 0 tc $tc \
		type ingress pool $POOL_ING \
		th 3000
done

The above command sets BUF_Q_RSRV_I(port 0, tc 0..7) to 3000 bytes.
The sharing watermarks are again reconfigured with 24000 bytes less.
