net: ipa: store average and peak interconnect bandwidth

Add fields in the ipa_interconnect structure to hold the average and
peak bandwidth values for the interconnect.  Pass the configuring
data for interconnects to ipa_interconnect_init() so these values
can be recorded, and use them when enabling the interconnects.

There's no longer any need to keep a copy of the interconnect data
after initialization.
