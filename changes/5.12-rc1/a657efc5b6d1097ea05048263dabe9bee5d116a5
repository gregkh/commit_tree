arm64: dts: allwinner: h6: Use - instead of @ for DT OPP entries

DTC and the dt-validate tools report warnings for opp with the format
opp@$frequency: dtc for a missing reg property, and dt-validate since
the binding requires child nodes to have the format opp-$frequency.

Change this to the latter format.
