mm/pgtable-generic.c: optimize the VM_BUG_ON condition in pmdp_huge_clear_flush()

The developer will have trouble figuring out why the BUG actually
triggered when there is a complex expression in the VM_BUG_ON.  Because we
can only identify the condition triggered BUG via line number provided by
VM_BUG_ON.  Optimize this by spliting such a complex expression into two
simple conditions.
