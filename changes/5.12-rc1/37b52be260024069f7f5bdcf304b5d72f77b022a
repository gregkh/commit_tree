ice: Set trusted VF as default VSI when setting allmulti on

Currently the PF will only set a trusted VF as the default VSI when it
requests FLAG_VF_UNICAST_PROMISC over VIRTCHNL. However, when
FLAG_VF_MULTICAST_PROMISC is set it's expected that the trusted VF will
see multicast packets that don't have a matching destination MAC in the
devices internal switch. Fix this by setting the trusted VF as the
default VSI if either FLAG_VF_UNICAST_PROMISC or
FLAG_VF_MULTICAST_PROMISC is set.
