vfs: don't unnecessarily clone write access for writable fds

There's no need for mnt_want_write_file() to increment mnt_writers when
the file is already open for writing, provided that
mnt_drop_write_file() is changed to conditionally decrement it.

We seem to have ended up in the current situation because
mnt_want_write_file() used to be paired with mnt_drop_write(), due to
mnt_drop_write_file() not having been added yet.  So originally
mnt_want_write_file() had to always increment mnt_writers.

But later mnt_drop_write_file() was added, and all callers of
mnt_want_write_file() were paired with it.  This makes the compatibility
between mnt_want_write_file() and mnt_drop_write() no longer necessary.

Therefore, make __mnt_want_write_file() and __mnt_drop_write_file() skip
incrementing mnt_writers on files already open for writing.  This
removes the only caller of mnt_clone_write(), so remove that too.
