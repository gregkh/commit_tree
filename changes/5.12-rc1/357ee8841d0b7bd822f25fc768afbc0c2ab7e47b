i2c: qcom-geni: Store DMA mapping data in geni_i2c_dev struct

Store DMA mapping data in geni_i2c_dev struct to enhance DMA mapping
data scope. For example during shutdown callback to unmap DMA mapping,
this stored DMA mapping data can be used to call geni_se_tx_dma_unprep
and geni_se_rx_dma_unprep functions.

Add two helper functions geni_i2c_rx_msg_cleanup and
geni_i2c_tx_msg_cleanup to unwrap the things after rx/tx FIFO/DMA
transfers, so that the same can be used in geni_i2c_stop_xfer()
function during shutdown callback.
