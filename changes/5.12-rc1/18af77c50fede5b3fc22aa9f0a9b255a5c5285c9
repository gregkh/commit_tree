drivers: net: xilinx_emaclite: remove arch limitation

The changes made in eccd540 is enough for xilinx_emaclite to run
without problem on 64-bit systems. I have tested it on a Xilinx
FPGA with RV64 softcore. The architecture limitation in Kconfig
seems no longer necessary.

A small change is included to print address with %lx instead of
casting to int and print with %x.
