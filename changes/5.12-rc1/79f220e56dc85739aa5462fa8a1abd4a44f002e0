tools/nolibc: Make dup2() rely on dup3() when available

A recent boot failure on 5.4-rc3 on arm64 revealed that sys_dup2()
is not available and that only sys_dup3() is implemented.  This commit
detects this and falls back to sys_dup3() when available.  This is a
port of nolibc's upstream commit fd5272ec2c66 to the Linux kernel.
