torture: Clean up after torture-test CPU hotplugging

This commit puts all CPUs back online at the end of a torture test,
and also unconditionally puts them online at the beginning of the test,
rather than just in the case of built-in tests.  This allows torture tests
to behave in a predictable manner, whether built-in or based on modules.
