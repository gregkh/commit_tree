i2c: iproc: handle only slave interrupts which are enabled

Handle only slave interrupts which are enabled.

The IS_OFFSET register contains the interrupt status bits which will be
set regardless of the enabling of the corresponding interrupt condition.
One must therefore look at both IS_OFFSET and IE_OFFSET to determine
whether an interrupt condition is set and enabled.
