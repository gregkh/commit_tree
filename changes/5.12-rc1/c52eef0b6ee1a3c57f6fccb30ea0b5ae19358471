of/device: Don't NULLify match table in of_match_device() with CONFIG_OF=n

This effectively reverts 1db73ae39a97 ("of/device: Nullify match table
in of_match_device() for CONFIG_OF=n") because that commit makes it more
surprising to users of this API that the arguments may never be
referenced by any code. This is because the pre-processor will replace
the argument with NULL and then the match table will be left unreferenced
by any code but the compiler optimizer doesn't know to drop it. This can
lead to compilers warning that match tables are unused, when we really
want to pass the match table to the API but have the compiler see that
it's all inlined and not used and then drop the match table while
silencing the warning. We're being too smart here and not giving the
compiler the chance to do dead code elimination.
