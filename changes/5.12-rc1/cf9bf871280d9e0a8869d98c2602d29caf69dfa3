net: mvneta: Remove per-cpu queue mapping for Armada 3700

According to Errata #23 "The per-CPU GbE interrupt is limited to Core
0", we can't use the per-cpu interrupt mechanism on the Armada 3700
familly.

This is correctly checked for RSS configuration, but the initial queue
mapping is still done by having the queues spread across all the CPUs in
the system, both in the init path and in the cpu_hotplug path.
