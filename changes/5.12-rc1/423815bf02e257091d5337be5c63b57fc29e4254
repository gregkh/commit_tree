habanalabs/gaudi: remove PCI access to SM block

Due to HW limitation we must remove all direct access to SM
registers, in order to do that we will access SM registers using
the HW QMANS.
When possible and no user context is present, we can directly access
the HW QMANS. Whenever there is an active user, driver will
prepare a pending command buffer list which will be sent upon
user submissions.
