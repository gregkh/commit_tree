bpf: Compute program stats for sleepable programs

Since sleepable programs don't migrate from the cpu the excution stats can be
computed for them as well. Reuse the same infrastructure for both sleepable and
non-sleepable programs.

run_cnt     -> the number of times the program was executed.
run_time_ns -> the program execution time in nanoseconds including the
               off-cpu time when the program was sleeping.
