x86/unwind/orc: Change REG_SP_INDIRECT

Currently REG_SP_INDIRECT is unused but means (%rsp + offset),
change it to mean (%rsp) + offset.

The reason is that we're going to swizzle stack in the middle of a C
function with non-trivial stack footprint. This means that when the
unwinder finds the ToS, it needs to dereference it (%rsp) and then add
the offset to the next frame, resulting in: (%rsp) + offset

This is somewhat unfortunate, since REG_BP_INDIRECT is used (by DRAP)
and thus needs to retain the current (%rbp + offset).
