iwlwifi: remove incorrect comment in pnvm

We use this driver as a backport that also runs on older kernels (as
part of the backports project).  So we use some checks to backport or
prevent code from compiling in incompatible kernel version.

When I took one of the PNVM patches from the backport, I accidentally
left the comment that a certain part of the code doesn't work in older
kernels.  This obviously should never be valid for the mainline.
Remove this comment.
