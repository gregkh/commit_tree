tcp: use a smaller percpu_counter batch size for sk_alloc

Currently, a percpu_counter with the default batch size (2*nr_cpus) is
used to record the total # of active sockets per protocol. This means
sk_sockets_allocated_read_positive() could be off by +/-2*(nr_cpus^2).
This under/over-estimation could lead to wrong memory suppression
conditions in __sk_raise_mem_allocated().
Fix this by using a more reasonable fixed batch size of 16.

See related commit cf86a086a180 ("net/dst: use a smaller percpu_counter
batch for dst entries accounting") that addresses a similar issue.
