cpufreq: brcmstb-avs-cpufreq: Free resources in error path

If 'cpufreq_register_driver()' fails, we must release the resources
allocated in 'brcm_avs_prepare_init()' as already done in the remove
function.

To do that, introduce a new function 'brcm_avs_prepare_uninit()' in order
to avoid code duplication. This also makes the code more readable (IMHO).
