scsi: MAINTAINERS: Adjust to reflect gdth scsi driver removal

Commit 0653c358d2dc ("scsi: Drop gdth driver") fails to update MAINTAINERS.

Hence, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains:

  warning: no file matches F:    drivers/scsi/gdt*

Remove the GDT SCSI DISK ARRAY CONTROLLER DRIVER section as well, as the
driver is removed now.
