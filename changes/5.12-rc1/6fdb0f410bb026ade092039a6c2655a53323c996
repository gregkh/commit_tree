powerpc/64: add context tracking to asynchronous interrupts

Previously context tracking was not done for asynchronous interrupts,
(those that run in interrupt context), and if those would cause a
reschedule when they exit, then scheduling functions (schedule_user,
preempt_schedule_irq) call exception_enter/exit to fix this up and
exit user context.

This is a hack we would like to get away from, so do context tracking
for asynchronous interrupts too.
