arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180: Add labels for cpuN-thermal nodes

Add labels to the cpuN-thermal nodes to allow board files to use
a phandle instead replicating the node hierarchy when adjusting
certain properties.

Due to the 'sustainable-power' property CPU thermal zones are
more likely to need property updates than other SC7180 zones,
hence only labels for CPU zones are added for now.
