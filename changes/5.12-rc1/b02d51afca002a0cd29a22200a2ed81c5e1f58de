Revert "Make sure clk scaling happens only when HBA is runtime ACTIVE"

Commit 73cc291c2702 ("scsi: ufs: Make sure clk scaling happens only
when HBA is runtime ACTIVE") is no longer needed since commit
0e9d4ca43ba8 ("scsi: ufs: Protect some contexts from unexpected clock
scaling") is a more mature fix to protect UFS LLD stability from clock
scaling invoked through sysfs nodes by users.
