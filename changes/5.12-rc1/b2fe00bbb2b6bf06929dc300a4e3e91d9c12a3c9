drm/i915: Drop i915_request.lock serialisation around await_start

Originally, we used the signal->lock as a means of following the
previous link in its timeline and peeking at the previous fence.
However, we have replaced the explicit serialisation with a series of
very careful probes that anticipate the links being deleted and the
fences recycled before we are able to acquire a strong reference to it.
We do not need the signal->lock crutch anymore, nor want the contention.
