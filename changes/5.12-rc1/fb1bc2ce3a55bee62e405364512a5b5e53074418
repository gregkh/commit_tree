wl3501: fix alignment constraints

struct wl3501_80211_tx_hdr contains a ieee80211_hdr structure, which is
required to have at least two byte alignment, and this conflicts with
the __packed attribute:

wireless/wl3501.h:553:1: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct wl3501_80211_tx_hdr' is less than 2 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]

Mark wl3501_80211_tx_hdr itself as having two-byte alignment to ensure the
inner structure is properly aligned.
