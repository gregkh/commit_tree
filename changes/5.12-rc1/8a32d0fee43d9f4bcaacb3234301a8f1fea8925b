doc/admin-guide/cgroup-v2: use tables

These two places are rendered like a table in the source (rst) code,
but they are seen as plain text by formatters, and thus are joined
together into a single line, e.g.:

> “root” - a partition root “member” - a non-root member of a partition

This is definitely not what was intended.

To fix, use table formatting, like in other places.
