dt-bindings: interconnect: Fix the expected number of cells

"make dtbs_check" complains that the number of interconnect-cells
for some RPMh platforms is not "const: 1" (as defined in the schema).

That's because the interconnect-cells now can be 1 or 2, depending
on what is supported by the specific interconnect provider. Let's
reflect this in the schema.
