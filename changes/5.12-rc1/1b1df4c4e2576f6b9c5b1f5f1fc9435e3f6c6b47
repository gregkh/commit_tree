kasan: adapt kmalloc_uaf2 test to HW_TAGS mode

In the kmalloc_uaf2() test, the pointers to the two allocated memory
blocks might happen to be the same, and the test will fail. With the
software tag-based mode, the probability of the that is 1/254, so it's
hard to observe the failure. For the hardware tag-based mode though,
the probablity is 1/14, which is quite noticable.

Allow up to 16 attempts at generating different tags for the tag-based
modes.
