crypto: bcm - Rename struct device_private to bcm_device_private

Renaming 'struct device_private' to 'struct bcm_device_private',
because it clashes with 'struct device_private' from
'drivers/base/base.h'.

While it's not a functional problem, it's causing two distinct
type hierarchies in BTF data. It also breaks build with options:
  CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF=y
  CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_BCM_SPU=y

as reported by Qais Yousef [1].
