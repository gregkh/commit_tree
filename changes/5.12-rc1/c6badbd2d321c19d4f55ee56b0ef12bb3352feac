arm64: dts: zynqmp: Add address-cells property to interrupt controllers

The commit 3eb619b2f7d8 ("scripts/dtc: Update to upstream version
v1.6.0-11-g9d7888cbf19c") updated dtc version which also contained DTC
commit
"81e0919a3e21 checks: Add interrupt provider test"
where reasons for this checking are mentioned as
"A missing #address-cells property is less critical, but creates
ambiguities when used in interrupt-map properties, so warn about this as
well now."

That's why add address-cells property to gic and gpio nodes to get rid of
this warning.
