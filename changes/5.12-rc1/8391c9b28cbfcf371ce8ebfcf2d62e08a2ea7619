drm/i915/selftests: Confirm CS_TIMESTAMP / CTX_TIMESTAMP share a clock

We assume that both timestamps are driven off the same clock [reported
to userspace as I915_PARAM_CS_TIMESTAMP_FREQUENCY]. Verify that this is
so by reading the timestamp registers around a busywait (on an otherwise
idle engine so there should be no preemptions).

v2: Icelake (not ehl, nor tgl) seems to be using a fixed 80ns interval
for, and only for, CTX_TIMESTAMP -- or it may be GPU frequency and the
test is always running at maximum frequency?. As far as I can tell, this
isolated change in behaviour is undocumented.
