KVM: x86: hyper-v: Stop shadowing global 'current_vcpu' variable

'current_vcpu' variable in KVM is a per-cpu pointer to the currently
scheduled vcpu. kvm_hv_flush_tlb()/kvm_hv_send_ipi() functions used
to have local 'vcpu' variable to iterate over vCPUs but it's gone
now and there's no need to use anything but the standard 'vcpu' as
an argument.
