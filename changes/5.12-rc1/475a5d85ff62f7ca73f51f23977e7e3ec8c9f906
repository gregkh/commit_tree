regulator: pf8x00: fix nxp,phase-shift

Fix the ternary condition which is a bad coding style
in the kernel

I also remove the defering configuration of the nxp,phase-shift.
The configuration is now done at parsing time. It save some memory
and it's better for comprehension.

I also use the OTP default configuration when the parameter is wrong
or not specified.
I think that it's better to use the default configuration from the chip
than an arbitrary value.
