nvme: add 48-bit DMA address quirk for Amazon NVMe controllers

Some Amazon NVMe controllers do not follow the NVMe specification
and are limited to 48-bit DMA addresses.  Add a quirk to force
bounce buffering if needed and limit the IOVA allocation for these
devices.

This affects all current Amazon NVMe controllers that expose EBS
volumes (0x0061, 0x0065, 0x8061) and local instance storage
(0xcd00, 0xcd01, 0xcd02).
