nvmet: remove extra variable in smart log nsid

We remove the extra local variable struct nvmet_ns in
nvmet_get_smart_log_nsid() since req already has ns member that can be
reused, this also eliminates the explicit call to nvmet_put_namespace()
which is already present in the request completion path.
