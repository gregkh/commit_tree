x86/{fault,efi}: Fix and rename efi_recover_from_page_fault()

efi_recover_from_page_fault() doesn't recover -- it does a special EFI
mini-oops.  Rename it to make it clear that it crashes.

While renaming it, I noticed a blatant bug: a page fault oops in a
different thread happening concurrently with an EFI runtime service call
would be misinterpreted as an EFI page fault.  Fix that.

This isn't quite exact. The situation could be improved by using a
special CS for calls into EFI.
