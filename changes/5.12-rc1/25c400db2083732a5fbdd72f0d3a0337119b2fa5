scsi: iscsi_tcp: Fix shost can_queue initialization

We are setting the shost's can_queue after we add the host which is too
late, because the SCSI midlayer will have allocated the tag set based on
the can_queue value at that time. This patch has us use the
iscsi_host_get_max_scsi_cmds() helper to figure out the number of SCSI
cmds.

It also fixes up the template can_queue so it reflects the max SCSI cmds we
can support like how other drivers work.
