drm/i915/gt: Track all timelines created using the HWSP

We assume that the contents of the HWSP are lost across suspend, and so
upon resume we must restore critical values such as the timeline seqno.
Keep track of every timeline allocated that uses the HWSP as its storage
and so we can then reset all seqno values by walking that list.
