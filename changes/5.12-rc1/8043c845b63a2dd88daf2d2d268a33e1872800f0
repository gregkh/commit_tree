net: bridge: use switchdev for port flags set through sysfs too

Looking through patchwork I don't see that there was any consensus to
use switchdev notifiers only in case of netlink provided port flags but
not sysfs (as a sort of deprecation, punishment or anything like that),
so we should probably keep the user interface consistent in terms of
functionality.
