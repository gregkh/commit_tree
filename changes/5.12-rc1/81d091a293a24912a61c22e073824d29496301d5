crypto: serpent - use unaligned accessors instead of alignmask

Instead of using an alignmask of 0x3 to ensure 32-bit alignment of the
Serpent input and output blocks, which propagates to mode drivers, and
results in pointless copying on architectures that don't care about
alignment, use the unaligned accessors, which will do the right thing on
each respective architecture, avoiding the need for double buffering.
