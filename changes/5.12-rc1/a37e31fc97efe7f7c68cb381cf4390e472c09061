firmware: smccc: Introduce SMCCC TRNG framework

The ARM DEN0098 document describe an SMCCC based firmware service to
deliver hardware generated random numbers. Its existence is advertised
according to the SMCCC v1.1 specification.

Add a (dummy) call to probe functions implemented in each architecture
(ARM and arm64), to determine the existence of this interface.
For now this return false, but this will be overwritten by each
architecture's support patch.
