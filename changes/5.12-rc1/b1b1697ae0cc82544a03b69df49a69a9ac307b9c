KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Remove support for running HPT guest on RPT host without mixed mode support

This reverts much of commit c01015091a770 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Run HPT
guests on POWER9 radix hosts"), which was required to run HPT guests on
RPT hosts on early POWER9 CPUs without support for "mixed mode", which
meant the host could not run with MMU on while guests were running.

This code has some corner case bugs, e.g., when the guest hits a machine
check or HMI the primary locks up waiting for secondaries to switch LPCR
to host, which they never do. This could all be fixed in software, but
most CPUs in production have mixed mode support, and those that don't
are believed to be all in installations that don't use this capability.
So simplify things and remove support.
