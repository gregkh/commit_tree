drm/virtio: rework virtio_fence_signaled

virtio_gpu_fence_event_process sets the last_fence_id and
subsequently calls dma_fence_signal_locked(..).

dma_fence_signal_locked(..) sets DMA_FENCE_FLAG_SIGNALED_BIT,
which is actually checked before &dma_fence_ops.(*signaled) is
called.

The check for last_fence_id is therefore a bit redundant, and
it will not be sufficient to check the last_fence_id for multiple
synchronization timelines.  Remove it.

v3: add r-b tags
