bpf: Replace fput with sockfd_put in sock map

The function sockfd_lookup uses fget on the value that is stored in
the file field of the returned structure, so fput should ultimately
be applied to this value. This can be done directly, but it seems
better to use the specific macro sockfd_put, which does the same
thing.

The cleanup was done using the following semantic patch:
    (http://www.emn.fr/x-info/coccinelle/)

    // <smpl>
    @@
    expression s;
    @@

       s = sockfd_lookup(...)
       ...
    +  sockfd_put(s);
    ?- fput(s->file);
    // </smpl>
