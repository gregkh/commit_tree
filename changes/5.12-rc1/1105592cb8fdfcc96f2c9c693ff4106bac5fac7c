can: tcan4x5x: remove __packed attribute from struct tcan4x5x_map_buf

The first member of struct tcan4x5x_map_buf is the struct tcan4x5x_buf_cmd,
which has a size of 4 bytes. It's followed by an array of u8. The compiler
places the array directly after the struct tcan4x5x_buf_cmd.

This patch removes the not needed attribute __packed from the struct
tcan4x5x_map_buf.
