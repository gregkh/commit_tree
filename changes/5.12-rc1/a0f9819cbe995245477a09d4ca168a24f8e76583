clk: socfpga: agilex: add clock driver for eASIC N5X platform

Add support for Intel's eASIC N5X platform. The clock manager driver for
the N5X is very similar to the Agilex platform, we can re-use most of
the Agilex clock driver.

This patch makes the necessary changes for the driver to differentiate
between the Agilex and the N5X platforms.
