cifs: clarify hostname vs ip address in /proc/fs/cifs/DebugData

/proc/fs/cifs/DebugData called the ip address for server sessions
"Name" which is confusing since it is not a hostname. Change
this field name to "Address" and for the list of servers add
new field "Hostname" which is populated from the hostname used
to connect to the server.  See below. And also don't print
[NONE] when the interface list is empty as it is not clear
what 'NONE' referred to.

Servers:
1) ConnectionId: 0x1 Hostname: localhost
Number of credits: 389 Dialect 0x311

In Send: 0 In MaxReq Wait: 0

	Sessions:
	1) Address: 127.0.0.1
