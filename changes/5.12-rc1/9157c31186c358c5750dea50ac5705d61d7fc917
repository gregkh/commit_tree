hugetlb: convert PageHugeTemporary() to HPageTemporary flag

Use new hugetlb specific HPageTemporary flag to replace the
PageHugeTemporary() interfaces.  PageHugeTemporary does contain a
PageHuge() check.  However, this interface is only used within hugetlb
code where we know we are dealing with a hugetlb page.  Therefore, the
check can be eliminated.
