xen/arm: don't ignore return errors from set_phys_to_machine

set_phys_to_machine can fail due to lack of memory, see the kzalloc call
in arch/arm/xen/p2m.c:__set_phys_to_machine_multi.

Don't ignore the potential return error in set_foreign_p2m_mapping,
returning it to the caller instead.

This is part of XSA-361.
