drm/amdgpu: enable wave limit on non high prio cs pipes

To achieve the best QoS for high priority compute jobs it is
required to limit waves on other compute pipes as well.
This patch will set min value in non high priority
mmSPI_WCL_PIPE_PERCENT_CS[0-3] registers to minimize the
impact of normal/low priority compute jobs over high priority
compute jobs.
