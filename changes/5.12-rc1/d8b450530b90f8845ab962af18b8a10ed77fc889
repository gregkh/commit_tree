tlb: mmu_gather: Introduce tlb_gather_mmu_fullmm()

Passing the range '0, -1' to tlb_gather_mmu() sets the 'fullmm' flag,
which indicates that the mm_struct being operated on is going away. In
this case, some architectures (such as arm64) can elide TLB invalidation
by ensuring that the TLB tag (ASID) associated with this mm is not
immediately reclaimed. Although this behaviour is documented in
asm-generic/tlb.h, it's subtle and easily missed.

Introduce tlb_gather_mmu_fullmm() to make it clearer that this is for the
entire mm and WARN() if tlb_gather_mmu() is called with the 'fullmm'
address range.
