iwlwifi: mvm: store PPAG enabled/disabled flag properly

When reading the PPAG table from ACPI, we should store everything in
our fwrt structure, so it can be accessed later.  But we had a local
ppag_table variable in the function and were erroneously storing the
enabled/disabled flag in it instead of storing it in the fwrt.  Fix
this by removing the local variable and storing everything directly in
fwrt.
