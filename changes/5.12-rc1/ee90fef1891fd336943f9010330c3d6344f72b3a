MIPS: CPS: don't create redundant .text.cps-vec section

A number of symbols from arch/mips/kernel/cps-vec.S is explicitly
placed into '.text.cps-vec' section.
There are no direct references to this section, so there's no need
to form it. '.balign 0x1000' directive will work anyway.

Moreover, this section was being placed in vmlinux differently
depending on CONFIG_LD_DEAD_CODE_DATA_ELIMINATION:
 - with this option enabled, '.text.cps-vec' was being caught
   by '.text.[0-9a-zA-Z_]*' from include/asm-generic/vmlinux.lds.h;
 - without this option, '.text.cps-vec' was being caught
   by discouraging '.text.*' from arch/mips/kernel/vmlinux.lds.S.

'.text.*' should not be used in vmlinux linker scripts at all as it
silently catches any orphan text sections.
So, remove both '.section .text.cps-vec' and '.text.*' from cps-vec.S
and vmlinux.lds.S respectively. As said, this does not affect related
functions alignment:
