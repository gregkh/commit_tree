firmware: google: make coreboot driver's remove callback return void

All coreboot drivers return 0 unconditionally in their remove callback.
Also the device core ignores the return value of the struct
bus_type::remove(), so make the coreboot remove callback return void
instead of giving driver authors the illusion they could return an error
code here.

All drivers are adapted accordingly.
