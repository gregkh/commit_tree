RDMA/bnxt_re: Code refactor while populating user MRs

Refactor code that populates MR page buffer list. Instead of allocating a
pbl_tbl to hold the buffer list, pass the struct ib_umem directly to
bnxt_qplib_alloc_init_hwq() as done for other user space memories.  Fix
the PBL level to handle the above mentioned change.

Also, remove an unwanted flag from the input to bnxt_qplib_reg_mr()
function.
