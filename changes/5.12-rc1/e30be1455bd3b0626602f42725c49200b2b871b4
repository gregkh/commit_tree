KVM: arm64: Move __hyp_set_vectors out of .hyp.text

The .hyp.text section is supposed to be reserved for the nVHE EL2 code.
However, there is currently one occurrence of EL1 executing code located
in .hyp.text when calling __hyp_{re}set_vectors(), which happen to sit
next to the EL2 stub vectors. While not a problem yet, such patterns
will cause issues when removing the host kernel from the TCB, so a
cleaner split would be preferable.

Fix this by delimiting the end of the .hyp.text section in hyp-stub.S.
