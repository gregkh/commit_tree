srcu: Provide polling interfaces for Tree SRCU grace periods

There is a need for a polling interface for SRCU grace
periods, so this commit supplies get_state_synchronize_srcu(),
start_poll_synchronize_srcu(), and poll_state_synchronize_srcu() for this
purpose.  The first can be used if future grace periods are inevitable
(perhaps due to a later call_srcu() invocation), the second if future
grace periods might not otherwise happen, and the third to check if a
grace period has elapsed since the corresponding call to either of the
first two.

As with get_state_synchronize_rcu() and cond_synchronize_rcu(),
the return value from either get_state_synchronize_srcu() or
start_poll_synchronize_srcu() must be passed in to a later call to
poll_state_synchronize_srcu().
