mm/vmscan: __isolate_lru_page_prepare() cleanup

The function just returns 2 results, so using a 'switch' to deal with its
result is unnecessary.  Also simplify it to a bool func as Vlastimil
suggested.

Also remove 'goto' by reusing list_move(), and take Matthew Wilcox's
suggestion to update comments in function.
