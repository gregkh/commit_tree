tcp: tcp_data_ready() must look at SOCK_DONE

My prior cleanup missed that tcp_data_ready() has to look at SOCK_DONE.
Otherwise, an application using SO_RCVLOWAT will not get EPOLLIN event
if a FIN is received in the middle of expected payload.

The reason SOCK_DONE is not examined in tcp_epollin_ready()
is that tcp_poll() catches the FIN because tcp_fin()
is also setting RCV_SHUTDOWN into sk->sk_shutdown
