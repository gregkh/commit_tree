platform/surface: Add Surface Aggregator user-space interface

Add a misc-device providing user-space access to the Surface Aggregator
EC, mainly intended for debugging, testing, and reverse-engineering.
This interface gives user-space applications the ability to send
requests to the EC and receive the corresponding responses.

The device-file is managed by a pseudo platform-device and corresponding
driver to avoid dependence on the dedicated bus, allowing it to be
loaded in a minimal configuration.

A python library and scripts to access this device can be found at [1].
