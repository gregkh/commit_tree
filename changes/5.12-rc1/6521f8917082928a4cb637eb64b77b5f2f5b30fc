namei: prepare for idmapped mounts

The various vfs_*() helpers are called by filesystems or by the vfs
itself to perform core operations such as create, link, mkdir, mknod, rename,
rmdir, tmpfile and unlink. Enable them to handle idmapped mounts. If the
inode is accessed through an idmapped mount map it into the
mount's user namespace and pass it down. Afterwards the checks and
operations are identical to non-idmapped mounts. If the initial user
namespace is passed nothing changes so non-idmapped mounts will see
identical behavior as before.
