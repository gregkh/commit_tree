ACPI: platform: Add balanced-performance platform profile

Some devices, including most Microsoft Surface devices, have a platform
profile somewhere inbetween balanced and performance. More specifically,
adding this profile allows the following mapping on Surface devices:

  Vendor Name           Platform Profile
  ------------------------------------------
  Battery Saver         low-power
  Recommended           balanced
  Better Performance    balanced-performance
  Best Performance      performance
