tools/nolibc: Emit detailed error for missing alternate syscall number definitions

Some syscalls can be implemented from different __NR_* variants. For
example, sys_dup2() can be implemented based on __NR_dup3 or __NR_dup2.
In this case it is useful to mention both alternatives in error messages
when neither are detected. This information will help the user search for
the right one (e.g __NR_dup3) instead of just the fallback (__NR_dup2)
which might not exist on the platform.

This is a port of nolibc's upstream commit a21080d2ba41 to the Linux
kernel.
