Revert "net: ipv4: handle DSA enabled master network devices"

This reverts commit 728c02089a0e3eefb02e9927bfae50490f40e72e.

Since 2015 DSA has gained more integration with the network stack, we
can now have the same functionality without explicitly open-coding for
it:
- It now opens the DSA master netdevice automatically whenever a user
  netdevice is opened.
- The master and switch interfaces are coupled in an upper/lower
  hierarchy using the netdev adjacency lists.

In the nfsroot example below, the interface chosen by autoconfig was
swp3, and every interface except that and the DSA master, eth1, was
brought down afterwards:
