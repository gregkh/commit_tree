i2c: designware: Get right data length

IC_DATA_CMD[11] indicates the first data byte received after the address
phase for receive transfer in Master receiver or Slave receiver mode,
this bit was set in some transfer flow. IC_DATA_CMD[7:0] contains the
data to be transmitted or received on the I2C bus, so we should use the
lower 8 bits to get the real data length.
