arm64: dts: imx8mq: use_dt_domains for pci node

We are using Jailhouse Hypervsior which has virtual pci node that
use dt domains. so also use dt domains for pci node, this will avoid
conflict with Jailhouse Hypervisor to trigger the following error:
          pr_err("Inconsistent \"linux,pci-domain\" property in DT\n");
