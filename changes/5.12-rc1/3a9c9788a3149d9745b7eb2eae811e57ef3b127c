mm: don't pass "enum lru_list" to lru list addition functions

The "enum lru_list" parameter to add_page_to_lru_list() and
add_page_to_lru_list_tail() is redundant in the sense that it can
be extracted from the "struct page" parameter by page_lru().

A caveat is that we need to make sure PageActive() or
PageUnevictable() is correctly set or cleared before calling
these two functions. And they are indeed.
