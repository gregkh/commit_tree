KVM: x86/mmu: Add comment on __tdp_mmu_set_spte

__tdp_mmu_set_spte is a very important function in the TDP MMU which
already accepts several arguments and will take more in future commits.
To offset this complexity, add a comment to the function describing each
of the arguemnts.

No functional change intended.
