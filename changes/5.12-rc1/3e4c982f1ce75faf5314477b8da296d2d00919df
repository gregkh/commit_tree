Revert "driver core: Set fw_devlink=on by default"

This reverts commit e590474768f1cc04852190b61dec692411b22e2a.

While things are _almost_ there and working for almost all systems,
there are still reported regressions happening, so let's revert this
default for 5.12.  We can bring it back in linux-next after 5.12-rc1 is
out to get more testing and hopefully solve the remaining different
subsystem and driver issues that people are running into.
