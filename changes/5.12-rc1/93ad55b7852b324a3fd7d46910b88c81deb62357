arm64: cpufeatures: Allow disabling of BTI from the command-line

In order to be able to disable BTI at runtime, whether it is
for testing purposes, or to work around HW issues, let's add
support for overriding the ID_AA64PFR1_EL1.BTI field.

This is further mapped on the arm64.nobti command-line alias.
