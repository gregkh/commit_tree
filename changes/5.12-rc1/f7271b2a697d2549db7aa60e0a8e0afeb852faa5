HID: uclogic: Improve support for Trust Panora

After more discussions with the [libinput project][1], it has been
determined that the uclogic driver provides better support for this
tablet. Fortunately, the Trust Panora is physically and logically
identical with the UGEE G5, despite having a different USB vendor and
product ID.
