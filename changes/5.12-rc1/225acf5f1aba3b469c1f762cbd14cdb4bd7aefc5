scsi: ibmvfc: Move event pool init/free routines

The next patch in this series reworks the event pool allocation calls to
happen within the individual queue allocation routines instead of as
independent calls.

Move the init/free routines earlier in ibmvfc.c to prevent undefined
reference errors when calling these functions from the queue allocation
code. No functional change.
