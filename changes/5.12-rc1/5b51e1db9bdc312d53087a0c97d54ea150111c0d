x86/entry: Convert device interrupts to inline stack switching

Convert device interrupts to inline stack switching by replacing the
existing macro implementation with the new inline version. Tweak the
function signature of the actual handler function to have the vector
argument as u32. That allows the inline macro to avoid extra intermediates
and lets the compiler be smarter about the whole thing.
