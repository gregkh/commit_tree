RDMA/hns: Bugfix for checking whether the srq is full when post wr

If a user posts WR by wr_list, the head pointer of idx_queue won't be
updated until all wqes are filled, so the judgment of whether head equals
to tail will get a wrong result. Fix above issue and move the head and
tail pointer from the srq structure into the idx_queue structure. After
idx_queue is filled with wqe idx, the head pointer of it will increase.
