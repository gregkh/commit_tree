btrfs: zoned: extend zoned allocator to use dedicated tree-log block group

This is the 1/3 patch to enable tree log on zoned filesystems.

The tree-log feature does not work on a zoned filesystem as is. Blocks for
a tree-log tree are allocated mixed with other metadata blocks and btrfs
writes and syncs the tree-log blocks to devices at the time of fsync(),
which has a different timing than a global transaction commit. As a
result, both writing tree-log blocks and writing other metadata blocks
become non-sequential writes that zoned filesystems must avoid.

Introduce a dedicated block group for tree-log blocks, so that tree-log
blocks and other metadata blocks can be separate write streams.  As a
result, each write stream can now be written to devices separately.
"fs_info->treelog_bg" tracks the dedicated block group and assigns
"treelog_bg" on-demand on tree-log block allocation time.

This commit extends the zoned block allocator to use the block group.
