dt-bindings: usb: usb-hcd: Detach generic USB controller properties

There can be three distinctive types of the USB controllers: USB hosts,
USB peripherals/gadgets and USB OTG, which can switch from one role to
another. In order to have that hierarchy handled in the DT binding files,
we need to collect common properties in a common DT schema and specific
properties in dedicated schemas. Seeing the usb-hcd.yaml DT schema is
dedicated for the USB host controllers only, let's move some common
properties from there into the usb.yaml schema. So the later would be
available to evaluate all currently supported types of the USB
controllers.

While at it add an explicit "additionalProperties: true" into the
usb-hcd.yaml as setting the additionalProperties/unevaluateProperties
properties is going to be get mandatory soon.
