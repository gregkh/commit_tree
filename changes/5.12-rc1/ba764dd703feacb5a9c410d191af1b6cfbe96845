s390/pci: refactor zpci_create_device()

Currently zpci_create_device() is only called in clp_add_pci_device()
which allocates the memory for the struct zpci_dev being created. There
is little separation of concerns as only both functions together can
create a zpci_dev and the only CLP specific code in
clp_add_pci_device() is a call to clp_query_pci_fn().

Improve this by removing clp_add_pci_device() and refactor
zpci_create_device() such that it alone creates and initializes the
zpci_dev given the FID and Function Handle. For this we need to make
clp_query_pci_fn() non-static. While at it remove the function handle
parameter since we can just take that from the zpci_dev. Also move
adding to the zpci_list to after the zdev has been fully created which
eliminates a window where a partially initialized zdev can be found by
get_zdev_by_fid().
