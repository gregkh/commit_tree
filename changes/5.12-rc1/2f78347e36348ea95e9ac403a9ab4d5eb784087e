drm/i915: Capture max frl rate for PCON in dfp cap structure

HDMI2.1 PCON advertises Max FRL bandwidth supported by the PCON.

This patch captures this in dfp cap structure in intel_dp and uses
this to prune connector modes that cannot be supported by the PCON
and FRL bandwidth.

v2: Addressed review comments from Uma Shankar:
-tweaked the comparison of target bw and pcon frl bw to avoid roundup errors.
-minor modification of field names and comments.
