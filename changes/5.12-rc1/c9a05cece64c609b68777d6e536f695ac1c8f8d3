media: ov5647: Fix style issues

The driver has some obvious style issues which are worth fixing before
expanding the driver capabilities.

Fix:
- Variable declaration order
- Function parameters alignment
- Multi-line comments and spurious line breaks
- Use lowercase for hexadecimal values
- > 80 cols lines

Cosmetic change, no functional changes intended.
