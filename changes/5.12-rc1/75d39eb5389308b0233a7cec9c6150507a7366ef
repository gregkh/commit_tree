staging: hikey9xx: hi6421v600-regulator: fix get_optimum_mode

During the driver refactor, a regression broke the logic inside
hi6421_spmi_regulator_get_optimum_mode(). Basically, if a LDO
has eco_uA == 0, it doesn't support economic mode. So, it should
return REGULATOR_MODE_NORMAL.

If economic mode is supported, it can return either
REGULATOR_MODE_IDLE or REGULATOR_MODE_NORMAL, depending on the
load current.
