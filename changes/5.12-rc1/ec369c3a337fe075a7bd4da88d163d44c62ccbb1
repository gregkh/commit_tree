mptcp: do not queue excessive data on subflows

The current packet scheduler can enqueue up to sndbuf
data on each subflow. If the send buffer is large and
the subflows are not symmetric, this could lead to
suboptimal aggregate bandwidth utilization.

Limit the amount of queued data to the maximum send
window.
