dmaengine: dw-axi-dmac: Support burst residue granularity

Add support for DMA_RESIDUE_GRANULARITY_BURST so that AxiDMA can report
DMA residue.

Existing AxiDMA driver only support data transfer between
memory to memory operation, therefore reporting DMA residue
to the DMA clients is not supported.

Reporting DMA residue to the DMA clients is important as DMA clients
shall invoke dmaengine_tx_status() to understand the number of bytes
been transferred so that the buffer pointer can be updated accordingly.
