media: ov8856: Configure sensor for GRBG Bayer for all modes

The previously added modes 3264x2448 & 1632x1224 are actually
configuring the sensor for BGGR mode, this is an issue since
the mode that is exposed through V4L incorrectly is set as GRBG.

This patch fixes the issue by moving the output crop window of
internal sensor ISP uses by one row, which means that the Bayer
pattern of the output is changed.
