media: vidtv: remove unused field from 'struct vidtv_mpeg_ts'

Commit 3d1387b3b8f6 ("media: vidtv: fix some warnings") replaced
the unused flexible array member at the end of struct vidtv_mpeg_ts
with a pointer. This broke the 188-byte alignment since the struct
no longer was 4 bytes in size.

Fix this by removing this field entirely.
