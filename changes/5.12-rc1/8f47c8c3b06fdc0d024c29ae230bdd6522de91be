drm/i915/pool: constrain pool objects by mapping type

In a few places we always end up mapping the pool object with the FORCE
constraint(to prevent hitting -EBUSY) which will destroy the cached
mapping if it has a different type. As a simple first step, make the
mapping type part of the pool interface, where the behaviour is to only
give out pool objects which match the requested mapping type.
