bnxt_en: Improve logging of error recovery settings information.

We currently only log the error recovery settings if it is enabled.
In some cases, firmware disables error recovery after it was
initially enabled.  Without logging anything, the user will not be
aware of this change in setting.

Log it when error recovery is disabled.  Also, change the reset count
value from hexadecimal to decimal.
