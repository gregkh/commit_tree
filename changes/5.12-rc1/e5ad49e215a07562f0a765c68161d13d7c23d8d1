btrfs: add a trace class for dumping the current ENOSPC state

Often when I'm debugging ENOSPC related issues I have to resort to
printing the entire ENOSPC state with trace_printk() in different spots.
This gets pretty annoying, so add a trace state that does this for us.
Then add a trace point at the end of preemptive flushing so you can see
the state of the space_info when we decide to exit preemptive flushing.
This helped me figure out we weren't kicking in the preemptive flushing
soon enough.
