ARM: dts: motorola-mapphone: Configure lower temperature passive cooling

The current cooling device temperature is too high at 100C as we have a
battery on the device right next to the SoC as pointed out by Carl Philipp
Klemm <philipp@uvos.xyz>. Let's configure the max temperature to 80C.

As we only have a tshut interrupt and no talert interrupt on 4430, we have
a passive cooling device configured for 4430. However, we want the poll
interval to be 10 seconds instead of 1 second for power management. The
value of 10 seconds seems like plenty of time to notice the temperature
increase above the 75C temperatures. Having the bandgap temperature change
seems to take several tens of seconds because of heat dissipation above
75C range as monitored with a full CPU load.
