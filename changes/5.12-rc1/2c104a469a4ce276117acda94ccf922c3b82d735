platform/goldfish: Convert pipe tasklet to threaded irq

Tasklets have long been deprecated as being too heavy on the system
by running in irq context - and this is not a performance critical
path. If a higher priority process wants to run, it must wait for
the tasklet to finish before doing so. A more suitable equivalent
is to converted to threaded irq instead and deal with the signaled
pipes in task context.
