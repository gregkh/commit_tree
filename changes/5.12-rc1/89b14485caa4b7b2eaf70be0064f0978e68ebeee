media: imx: Fix csc/scaler unregister

The csc/scaler device private struct is released by
ipu_csc_scaler_video_device_release(), which can be called
by video_unregister_device() if there are no users
of the underlying struct video device.

Therefore, the mutex can't be held when calling
video_unregister_device() as its memory may be freed
by it, leading to a kernel oops.

Fortunately, the fix is quite simple as no locking
is needed when calling video_unregister_device(): v4l2-core
already has its own internal locking, and the structures
are also properly refcounted.
