coresight: etm4x: Skip accessing TRCPDCR in save/restore

When the ETM is affected by Qualcomm errata, modifying the
TRCPDCR could cause the system hang. Even though this is
taken care of during enable/disable ETM, the ETM state
save/restore could still access the TRCPDCR. Make sure
we skip the access during the save/restore.
