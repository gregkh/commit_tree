soc: xilinx: vcu: make pll post divider explicit

According to the downstream driver documentation due to timing
constraints the output divider of the PLL has to be set to 1/2. Add a
helper function for that check instead of burying the code in one large
setup function.

The bit is undocumented and marked as reserved in the register
reference.
