ASoC: siu: Fix build error by a wrong const prefix

A const prefix was put wrongly in the middle at the code refactoring
commit 932eaf7c7904 ("ASoC: sh: siu_pcm: remove snd_pcm_ops"), which
leads to a build error as:
  sound/soc/sh/siu_pcm.c:546:8: error: expected '{' before 'const'

Also, another inconsistency is that the declaration of siu_component
misses the const prefix.

This patch corrects both failures.
