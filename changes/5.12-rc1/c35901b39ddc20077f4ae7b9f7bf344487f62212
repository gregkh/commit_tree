virt: vbox: Do not use wait_event_interruptible when called from kernel context

Do not use wait_event_interruptible when vbg_hgcm_call() gets called from
kernel-context, such as it being called by the vboxsf filesystem code.

This fixes some filesystem related system calls on shared folders
unexpectedly failing with -EINTR.
