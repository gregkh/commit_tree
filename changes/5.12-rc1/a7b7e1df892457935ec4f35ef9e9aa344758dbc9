mm/list_lru.c: remove kvfree_rcu_local()

The list_lru file used to have local kvfree_rcu() which was renamed by
commit e0feed08ab41 ("mm/list_lru.c: Rename kvfree_rcu() to local
variant") to introduce the globally visible kvfree_rcu().

Now we have global kvfree_rcu(), so remove the local kvfree_rcu_local()
and just use the global one.
