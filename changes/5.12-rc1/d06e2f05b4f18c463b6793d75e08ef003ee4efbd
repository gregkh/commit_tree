i40e: adjust i40e_is_non_eop

i40e_is_non_eop had a leftover comment and unused skb argument which was
used for placing the skb onto rx_buf in case when current buffer was
non-eop one. This is not relevant anymore as commit e72e56597ba1
("i40e/i40evf: Moves skb from i40e_rx_buffer to i40e_ring") pulled the
non-complete skb handling out of rx_bufs up to rx_ring.  Therefore,
let's adjust the function arguments that i40e_is_non_eop takes.

Furthermore, since there is already a function responsible for bumping
the ntc, make use of that and drop that logic from i40e_is_non_eop so
that the scope of this function is limited to what the name actually
states.
