xfs: separate log cleaning from log quiesce

Log quiesce is currently associated with cleaning the log, which is
accomplished by writing an unmount record as the last step of the
quiesce sequence. The quiesce codepath is a bit convoluted in this
regard due to how it is reused from various contexts. In preparation
to create separate log cleaning and log covering interfaces, lift
the write of the unmount record into a new cleaning helper and call
that wherever xfs_log_quiesce() is currently invoked. No functional
changes.
