KVM: x86/mmu: Mark SPTEs in disconnected pages as removed

When clearing TDP MMU pages what have been disconnected from the paging
structure root, set the SPTEs to a special non-present value which will
not be overwritten by other threads. This is needed to prevent races in
which a thread is clearing a disconnected page table, but another thread
has already acquired a pointer to that memory and installs a mapping in
an already cleared entry. This can lead to memory leaks and accounting
errors.
