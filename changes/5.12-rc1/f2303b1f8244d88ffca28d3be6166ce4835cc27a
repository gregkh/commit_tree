io_uring: keep generic rsrc infra generic

io_rsrc_ref_quiesce() is a generic resource function, though now it
was wired to allocate and initialise ref nodes with file-specific
callbacks/etc. Keep it sane by passing in as a parameters everything we
need for initialisations, otherwise it will hurt us badly one day.
