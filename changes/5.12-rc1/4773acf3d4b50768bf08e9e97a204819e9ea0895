b43: N-PHY: Fix the update of coef for the PHY revision >= 3case

The documentation for the PHY update [1] states:

Loop 4 times with index i

    If PHY Revision >= 3
        Copy table[i] to coef[i]
    Otherwise
        Set coef[i] to 0

the copy of the table to coef is currently implemented the wrong way
around, table is being updated from uninitialized values in coeff.
Fix this by swapping the assignment around.
