drm/i915/gt: Decouple completed requests on unwind

Since the introduction of preempt-to-busy, requests can complete in the
background, even while they are not on the engine->active.requests list.
As such, the engine->active.request list itself is not in strict
retirement order, and we have to scan the entire list while unwinding to
not miss any. However, if the request is completed we currently leave it
on the list [until retirement], but we could just as simply remove it
and stop treating it as active. We would only have to then traverse it
once while unwinding in quick succession.
