selftests/powerpc: Add VF recovery tests

The basic EEH test ignores VFs since we the way the eeh_dev_break debugfs
interface works means that if multiple VFs are enabled we may cause errors
on all them them. However, we can work around that by only enabling a
single VF at a time.

This patch adds some infrastructure for finding SR-IOV capable devices and
enabling / disabling VFs so we can exercise the VF specific EEH recovery
paths. Two new tests are added, one for testing EEH aware devices and one
for EEH un-aware VFs.
