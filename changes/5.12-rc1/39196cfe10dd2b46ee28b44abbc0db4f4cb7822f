power: supply: cpcap-charger: Fix power_supply_put on null battery pointer

Currently if the pointer battery is null there is a null pointer
dereference on the call to power_supply_put.  Fix this by only
performing the put if battery is not null.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference after null check")
