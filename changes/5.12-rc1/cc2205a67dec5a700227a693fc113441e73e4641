mm/hugetlb: fix potential double free in hugetlb_register_node() error path

In hugetlb_sysfs_add_hstate(), we would do kobject_put() on hstate_kobjs
when failed to create sysfs group but forget to set hstate_kobjs to NULL.
Then in hugetlb_register_node() error path, we may free it again via
hugetlb_unregister_node().
