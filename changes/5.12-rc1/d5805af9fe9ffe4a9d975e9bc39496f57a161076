riscv: Fix builtin DTB handling

All SiPeed K210 MAIX boards have the exact same vendor, arch and
implementation IDs, preventing differentiation to select the correct
device tree to use through the SOC_BUILTIN_DTB_DECLARE() macro. This
result in this macro to be useless and mandates changing the code of
the sysctl driver to change the builtin device tree suitable for the
target board.

Fix this problem by removing the SOC_BUILTIN_DTB_DECLARE() macro since
it is used only for the K210 support. The code searching the builtin
DTBs using the vendor, arch an implementation IDs is also removed.
Support for builtin DTB falls back to the simpler and more traditional
handling of builtin DTB using the CONFIG_BUILTIN_DTB option, similarly
to other architectures.
