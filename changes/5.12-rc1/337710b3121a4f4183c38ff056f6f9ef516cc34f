regulator: qcom-labibb: Use disable_irq_nosync from isr

Calling the disable_irq() from irq handler might be a bad idea as
disable_irq() should wait for handlers to run. I don't see why
this wouldn't deadlock in wait_event waiting for the threaded
handler to complete.

Use disable_irq_nosync() instead.
