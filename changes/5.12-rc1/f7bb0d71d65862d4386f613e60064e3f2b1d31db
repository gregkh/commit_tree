i40e: store the result of i40e_rx_offset() onto i40e_ring

Output of i40e_rx_offset() is based on ethtool's priv flag setting,
which when changed, causes PF reset (disables napi, frees irqs, loads
different Rx mem model, etc.). This means that within napi its result is
constant and there is no reason to call it per each processed frame.

Add new 'rx_offset' field to i40e_ring that is meant to hold the
i40e_rx_offset() result and use it within i40e_clean_rx_irq().
Furthermore, use it within i40e_alloc_mapped_page().

Last but not least, un-inline the function of interest so that compiler
makes the decision about inlining as it lives in .c file.
