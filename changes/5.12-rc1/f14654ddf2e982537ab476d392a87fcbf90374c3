ASoC: sync parameter naming : rate / sample_bits

snd_pcm_runtime / snd_soc_dai / snd_soc_dai_driver / snd_soc_dai_link
have related parameter which is similar but not same naming.

	struct snd_pcm_runtime {
		...
(A)		unsigned int rate;
		...
(B)		unsigned int sample_bits;
		...
	};

	struct snd_soc_dai {
		...
(A)		unsigned int rate;
(B)		unsigned int sample_bits;
		...
	};

	struct snd_soc_dai_driver {
		...
(A)		unsigned int symmetric_rates:1;
(B)		unsigned int symmetric_samplebits:1;
		...
	};

	struct snd_soc_dai_link {
		...
(A)		unsigned int symmetric_rates:1;
(B)		unsigned int symmetric_samplebits:1;
		...
	};

Because it is similar but not same naming rule,
code can be verbose / can't share macro.

This patch sync naming rule for framework.
	- xxx_rates;
	+ xxx_rate;

	- xxx_samplebits;
	+ xxx_sample_bits;

old name will be removed if all drivers were switched
to new naming rule.
