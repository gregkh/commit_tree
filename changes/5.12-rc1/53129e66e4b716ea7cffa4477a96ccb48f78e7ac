ASoC: SOF: relax ABI checks and avoid unnecessary warnings

With recent SOF 1.7 pre-releases, kernel has been emitting following
warnings at probe:

[10006.645216] sof-audio-pci 0000:00:1f.3: warn: FW ABI is more recent than kernel
[10006.652137] sof-audio-pci 0000:00:1f.3: warn: topology ABI is more recent than kernel

The warnings are emitted due to increase of the patch-level in firmware
mainline (to 3.17.1). But the patch level should not be considered even
in the strict ABI check, so modify the kernel side logic that makes the
check and only consider the major.minor components.
