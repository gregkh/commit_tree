entry/kvm: Explicitly flush pending rcuog wakeup before last rescheduling point

Following the idle loop model, cleanly check for pending rcuog wakeup
before the last rescheduling point upon resuming to guest mode. This
way we can avoid to do it from rcu_user_enter() with the last resort
self-IPI hack that enforces rescheduling.
