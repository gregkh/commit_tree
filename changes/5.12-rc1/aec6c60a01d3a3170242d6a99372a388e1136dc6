kbuild: check the minimum compiler version in Kconfig

Paul Gortmaker reported a regression in the GCC version check. [1]
If you use GCC 4.8, the build breaks before showing the error message
"error Sorry, your version of GCC is too old - please use 4.9 or newer."

I do not want to apply his fix-up since it implies we would not be able
to remove any cc-option test. Anyway, I admit checking the GCC version
in <linux/compiler-gcc.h> is too late.

Almost at the same time, Linus also suggested to move the compiler
version error to Kconfig time. [2]

I unified the two similar scripts, gcc-version.sh and clang-version.sh
into cc-version.sh. The old scripts invoked the compiler multiple times
(3 times for gcc-version.sh, 4 times for clang-version.sh). I refactored
the code so the new one invokes the compiler just once, and also tried
my best to use shell-builtin commands where possible.

The new script runs faster.

  $ time ./scripts/clang-version.sh clang
  120000

  real    0m0.029s
  user    0m0.012s
  sys     0m0.021s

  $ time ./scripts/cc-version.sh clang
  Clang 120000

  real    0m0.009s
  user    0m0.006s
  sys     0m0.004s

cc-version.sh also shows an error message if the compiler is too old:

  $ make defconfig CC=clang-9
  *** Default configuration is based on 'x86_64_defconfig'
  ***
  *** Compiler is too old.
  ***   Your Clang version:    9.0.1
  ***   Minimum Clang version: 10.0.1
  ***
  scripts/Kconfig.include:46: Sorry, this compiler is not supported.
  make[1]: *** [scripts/kconfig/Makefile:81: defconfig] Error 1
  make: *** [Makefile:602: defconfig] Error 2

The new script takes care of ICC because we have <linux/compiler-intel.h>
although I am not sure if building the kernel with ICC is well-supported.
