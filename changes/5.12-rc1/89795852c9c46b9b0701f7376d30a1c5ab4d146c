usb: typec: ucsi: Add support for USB role switch

UCSI already conveys the information about a port's connection
status, whether it is operating in UFP or DFP mode, and whether the
partner supports USB data or not. This information can be used to
notify a dual-role controller to start up its host or peripheral
mode accordingly. Add optional support for this by querying each
port's fwnode to look for an associated USB role switch device.
If present, call usb_role_switch_set() with the determined data
role upon Connect Change or Connector Partner Change updates.
