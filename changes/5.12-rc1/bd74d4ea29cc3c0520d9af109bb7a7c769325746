octeontx2-af: Add new CGX_CMD to get PHY FEC statistics

This patch adds support to fetch fec stats from PHY. The stats are
put in the shared data struct fwdata.  A PHY driver indicates
that it has FEC stats by setting the flag fwdata.phy.misc.has_fec_stats

Besides CGX_CMD_GET_PHY_FEC_STATS, also add CGX_CMD_PRBS and
CGX_CMD_DISPLAY_EYE to enum cgx_cmd_id so that Linux's enum list is in sync
with firmware's enum list.
