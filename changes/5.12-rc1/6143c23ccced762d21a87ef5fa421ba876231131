btrfs: zoned: implement cloning for zoned device-replace

This is 2/4 patch to implement device replace for zoned filesystems.

In zoned mode, a block group must be either copied (from the source
device to the target device) or cloned (to both devices).

Implement the cloning part. If a block group targeted by an IO is marked
to copy, we should not clone the IO to the destination device, because
the block group is eventually copied by the replace process.

This commit also handles cloning of device reset.
