brcmfmac: clear EAP/association status bits on linkdown events

This ensure that previous association attempts do not leave stale statuses
on subsequent attempts.

This fixes the WARN_ON(!cr->bss)) from __cfg80211_connect_result() when
connecting to an AP after a previous connection failure (e.g. where EAP fails
due to incorrect psk but association succeeded). In some scenarios, indeed,
brcmf_is_linkup() was reporting a link up event too early due to stale
BRCMF_VIF_STATUS_ASSOC_SUCCESS bit, thus reporting to cfg80211 a connection
result with a zeroed bssid (vif->profile.bssid is still empty), causing the
WARN_ON due to the call to cfg80211_get_bss() with the empty bssid.
