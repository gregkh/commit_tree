KVM: x86/mmu: Expand collapsible SPTE zap for TDP MMU to ZONE_DEVICE and HugeTLB pages

Zap SPTEs that are backed by ZONE_DEVICE pages when zappings SPTEs to
rebuild them as huge pages in the TDP MMU.  ZONE_DEVICE huge pages are
managed differently than "regular" pages and are not compound pages.
Likewise, PageTransCompoundMap() will not detect HugeTLB, so switch
to PageCompound().

This matches the similar check in kvm_mmu_zap_collapsible_spte.
