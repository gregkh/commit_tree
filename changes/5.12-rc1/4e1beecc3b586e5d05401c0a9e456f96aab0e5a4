net/sock: Add kernel config SOCK_RX_QUEUE_MAPPING

Use a new config SOCK_RX_QUEUE_MAPPING to compile-in the socket
RX queue field and logic, instead of the XPS config.
This breaks dependency in XPS, and allows selecting it from non-XPS
use cases, as we do in the next patch.

In addition, use the new flag to wrap the logic in sk_rx_queue_get()
and protect access to the sk_rx_queue_mapping field, while keeping
the function exposed unconditionally, just like sk_rx_queue_set()
and sk_rx_queue_clear().
