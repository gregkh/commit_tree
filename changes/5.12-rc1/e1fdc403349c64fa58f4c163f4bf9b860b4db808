lib: stackdepot: add support to disable stack depot

Add a kernel parameter stack_depot_disable to disable stack depot.  So
that stack hash table doesn't consume any memory when stack depot is
disabled.

The use case is CONFIG_PAGE_OWNER without page_owner=on.  Without this
patch, stackdepot will consume the memory for the hashtable.  By default,
it's 8M which is never trivial.

With this option, in CONFIG_PAGE_OWNER configured system, page_owner=off,
stack_depot_disable in kernel command line, we could save the wasted
memory for the hashtable.
