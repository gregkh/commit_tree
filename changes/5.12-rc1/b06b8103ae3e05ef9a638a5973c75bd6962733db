drm/i915/gt: Add arbitration check before semaphore wait

Similar to commit 49b20dbf7497 ("drm/i915/gt: Perform an arbitration
check before busywaiting"), also add a check prior to the busywait
on gen8+, as we have now seen (because we added a selftest to add fault
injection into the engine resets) the same engine reset failure leading
to an indefinite wait on the ring-stop semaphore. So not a Tigerlake
specific bug after all, though it still seems odd behaviour for the
busywait as we do get the arbitration point elsewhere on a miss.

Testcase: igt_reset_fail_engine
