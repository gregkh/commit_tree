soc: aspeed: snoop: Add clock control logic

If LPC SNOOP driver is registered ahead of lpc-ctrl module, LPC
SNOOP block will be enabled without heart beating of LCLK until
lpc-ctrl enables the LCLK. This issue causes improper handling on
host interrupts when the host sends interrupt in that time frame.
Then kernel eventually forcibly disables the interrupt with
dumping stack and printing a 'nobody cared this irq' message out.

To prevent this issue, all LPC sub-nodes should enable LCLK
individually so this patch adds clock control logic into the LPC
SNOOP driver.
