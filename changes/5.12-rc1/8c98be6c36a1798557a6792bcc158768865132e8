perf daemon: Allow only one daemon over base directory

Add 'lock' file under daemon base and flock it, so only one perf daemon
can run on top of it.

Each daemon tries to create and lock BASE/lock file, if it's successful
we are sure we're the only daemon running over the BASE.

Once daemon is finished, file descriptor to lock file is closed and lock
is released.

Example:

  # cat ~/.perfconfig
  [daemon]
  base=/opt/perfdata

  [session-cycles]
  run = -m 10M -e cycles --overwrite --switch-output -a

  [session-sched]
  run = -m 20M -e sched:* --overwrite --switch-output -a

Starting the daemon:

  # perf daemon start

And try once more:

  # perf daemon start
  failed: another perf daemon (pid 775594) owns /opt/perfdata

will end up with an error, because there's already one running
on top of /opt/perfdata.

Committer notes:

Provide lockf(F_TLOCK) when not available, i.e. transform:

  lockf(fd, F_TLOCK, 0);

into:

  flock(fd, LOCK_EX | LOCK_NB);

Which should be equivalent.

Noticed when cross building to some odd Android NDK.
