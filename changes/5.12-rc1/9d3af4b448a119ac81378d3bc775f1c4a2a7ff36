mm: Pass 'address' to map to do_set_pte() and drop FAULT_FLAG_PREFAULT

Rather than modifying the 'address' field of the 'struct vm_fault'
passed to do_set_pte(), leave that to identify the real faulting address
and pass in the virtual address to be mapped by the new pte as a
separate argument.

This makes FAULT_FLAG_PREFAULT redundant, as a prefault entry can be
identified simply by comparing the new address parameter with the
faulting address, so remove the redundant flag at the same time.
