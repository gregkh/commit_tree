drm/amdgpu: enable only one high prio compute queue

For high priority compute to work properly we need to enable
wave limiting on gfx pipe. Wave limiting is done through writing
into mmSPI_WCL_PIPE_PERCENT_GFX register. Enable only one high
priority compute queue to avoid race condition between multiple
high priority compute queues writing that register simultaneously.
