platform/surface: aggregator_cdev: Fix access of uninitialized variables

When copy_struct_from_user() in ssam_cdev_request() fails, we directly
jump to the 'out' label. In this case, however 'spec' and 'rsp' are not
initialized, but we still access fields of those variables. Fix this by
initializing them at the time of their declaration.
