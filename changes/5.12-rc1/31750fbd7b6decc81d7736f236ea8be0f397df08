scsi: ibmvfc: Send commands down HW Sub-CRQ when channelized

When the client has negotiated the use of channels all vfcFrames are
required to go down a Sub-CRQ channel or it is a protocoal violation. If
the adapter state is channelized submit vfcFrames to the appropriate
Sub-CRQ via the h_send_sub_crq() helper.
