spi: orion: enable support for switching CS every transferred byte

Some SPI devices, require toggling the CS every transferred byte.
Enable such possibility in the spi-orion driver.

Note that in order to use it, in the driver of a secondary device
attached to this controller, the SPI bus 'mode' field must be
updated with SPI_CS_WORD flag before calling spi_setup() routine.

In addition to that include a work-around - some devices, such as
certain models of SLIC (Subscriber Line Interface Card),
may require extra delay after CS toggling, so add a minimal
timing relaxation in relevant places.
