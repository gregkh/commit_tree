powerpc/mm/book3s64/iommu: fix some RCU-list locks

It is safe to traverse mm->context.iommu_group_mem_list with either
mem_list_mutex or the RCU read lock held. Silence a few RCU-list false
positive warnings and fix a few missing RCU read locks.

 arch/powerpc/mm/book3s64/iommu_api.c:330 RCU-list traversed in non-reader section!!

 other info that might help us debug this:

 rcu_scheduler_active = 2, debug_locks = 1
