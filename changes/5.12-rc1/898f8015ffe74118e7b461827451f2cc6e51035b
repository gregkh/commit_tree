net: extract napi poll functionality to __napi_poll()

This commit introduces a new function __napi_poll() which does the main
logic of the existing napi_poll() function, and will be called by other
functions in later commits.
This idea and implementation is done by Felix Fietkau <nbd@nbd.name> and
is proposed as part of the patch to move napi work to work_queue
context.
This commit by itself is a code restructure.
