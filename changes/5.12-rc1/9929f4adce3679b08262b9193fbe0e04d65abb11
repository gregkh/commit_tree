xprtrdma: Remove FMR support in rpcrdma_convert_iovs()

Support for FMR was removed by commit ba69cd122ece ("xprtrdma:
Remove support for FMR memory registration") [Dec 2018]. That means
the buffer-splitting behavior of rpcrdma_convert_kvec(), added by
commit 821c791a0bde ("xprtrdma: Segment head and tail XDR buffers
on page boundaries") [Mar 2016], is no longer necessary. FRWR
memory registration handles this case with aplomb.
