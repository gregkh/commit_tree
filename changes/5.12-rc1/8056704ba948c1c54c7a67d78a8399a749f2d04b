regulator: qcom-labibb: Implement current limiting

LAB and IBB regulators can be current-limited by setting the
appropriate registers, but this operation is granted only after
sending an unlock code for secure access.

Besides the secure access, it would be possible to use the
regmap helper for get_current_limit, as there is no security
blocking reads, but I chose not to as to avoid having a very
big array containing current limits, especially for IBB.

That said, these regulators support current limiting for:
- LAB (pos): 200-1600mA, with 200mA per step (8 steps),
- IBB (neg):   0-1550mA, with  50mA per step (32 steps).
