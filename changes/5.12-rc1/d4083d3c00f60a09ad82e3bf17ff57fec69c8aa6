ibmvnic: Set to CLOSED state even on error

If set_link_state() fails for any reason, we still cleanup the adapter
state and cannot recover from a partial close anyway. So set the adapter
to CLOSED state. That way if a new soft/hard reset is processed, the
adapter will remain in the CLOSED state until the next ibmvnic_open().
