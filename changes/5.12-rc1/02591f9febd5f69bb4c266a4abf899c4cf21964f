NFSv4_2: SSC helper should use its own config.

Currently NFSv4_2 SSC helper, nfs_ssc, incorrectly uses GRACE_PERIOD
as its config. Fix by adding new config NFS_V4_2_SSC_HELPER which
depends on NFS_V4_2 and is automatically selected when NFSD_V4 is
enabled. Also removed the file name from a comment in nfs_ssc.c.
