mmc: cqhci: initialize upper 64 bits of 128-bit task descriptors

Move the task descriptor initialization into cqhci_prep_task_desc().
In addition, make it explicitly initialize all 128 bits of the task
descriptor if the host controller is using 128-bit task descriptors,
rather than relying on the implicit zeroing from dmam_alloc_coherent().

This is needed to prepare for CQHCI inline encryption support, which
requires 128-bit task descriptors and uses the upper 64 bits.
