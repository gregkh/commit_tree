soundwire: debugfs: use controller id instead of link_id

link_id can be zero and if we have multiple controller instances
in a system like Qualcomm debugfs will end-up with duplicate namespace
resulting in incorrect debugfs entries.

Using id should give a unique debugfs directory entry and should fix below
warning too.
"debugfs: Directory 'master-0' with parent 'soundwire' already present!"
