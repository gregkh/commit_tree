bpf: Helper script for running BPF presubmit tests

The script runs the BPF selftests locally on the same kernel image
as they would run post submit in the BPF continuous integration
framework.

The goal of the script is to allow contributors to run selftests locally
in the same environment to check if their changes would end up breaking
the BPF CI and reduce the back-and-forth between the maintainers and the
developers.
