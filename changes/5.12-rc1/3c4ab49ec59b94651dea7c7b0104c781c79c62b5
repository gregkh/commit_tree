ALSA: core: Fix the debugfs removal at snd_card_free()

The commit 2d670ea2bd53 ("ALSA: jack: implement software jack
injection via debugfs") introduced a debugfs root for each sound card
object.  The debugfs entry gets removed at the card removal, too, but
it turned out that debugfs_remove() is called at a wrong place; it's
after the card object gets freed, hence it leads to use-after-free.

Fix it by moving the debugfs_remove() at the right place, the
destructor of the card device.
