xfs: reduce ilock acquisitions in xfs_file_fsync

If the inode is not pinned by the time fsync is called we don't need the
ilock to protect against concurrent clearing of ili_fsync_fields as the
inode won't need a log flush or clearing of these fields.  Not taking
the iolock allows for full concurrency of fsync and thus O_DSYNC
completions with io_uring/aio write submissions.
