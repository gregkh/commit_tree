riscv: Separate memory init from paging init

Currently, we perform some memory init functions in paging init. But,
that will be an issue for NUMA support where DT needs to be flattened
before numa initialization and memblock_present can only be called
after numa initialization.

Move memory initialization related functions to a separate function.
