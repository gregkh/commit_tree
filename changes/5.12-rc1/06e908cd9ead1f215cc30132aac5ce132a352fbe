gfs2: Allow node-wide exclusive glock sharing

Introduce a new LM_FLAG_NODE_SCOPE glock holder flag: when taking a
glock in LM_ST_EXCLUSIVE (EX) mode and with the LM_FLAG_NODE_SCOPE flag
set, the exclusive lock is shared among all local processes who are
holding the glock in EX mode and have the LM_FLAG_NODE_SCOPE flag set.
From the point of view of other nodes, the lock is still held
exclusively.

A future patch will start using this flag to improve performance with
rgrp sharing.
