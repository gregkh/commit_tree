samples/bpf: Add BPF_ATOMIC_OP macro for BPF samples

Brendan Jackman added extend atomic operations to the BPF instruction
set in commit 7064a7341a0d ("Merge branch 'Atomics for eBPF'"), which
introduces the BPF_ATOMIC_OP macro. However, that macro was missing
for the BPF samples. Fix that by adding it into bpf_insn.h.
