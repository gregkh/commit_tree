MIPS: Support binutils configured with --enable-mips-fix-loongson3-llsc=yes

From version 2.35, binutils can be configured with
--enable-mips-fix-loongson3-llsc=yes, which means it defaults to
-mfix-loongson3-llsc. This breaks labels which might then point at the
wrong instruction.

The workaround to explicitly pass -mno-fix-loongson3-llsc has been
added in Linux version 5.1, but is only enabled when building a Loongson
64 kernel. As vendors might use a common toolchain for building Loongson
and non-Loongson kernels, just move that workaround to
arch/mips/Makefile. At the same time update the comments to reflect the
current status.
