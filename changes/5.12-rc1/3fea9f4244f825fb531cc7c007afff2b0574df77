drm/i915/display/psr: Use plane damage clips to calculate damaged area

Now using plane damage clips property to calcualte the damaged area.
Selective fetch only supports one region to be fetched so software
needs to calculate a bounding box around all damage clips.

Now that we are not complete fetching each plane, there is another
loop needed as all the plane areas that intersect with the pipe
damaged area needs to be fetched from memory so the complete blending
of all planes can happen.

v2:
- do not shifting new_plane_state->uapi.dst only src is in 16.16 format

v4:
- setting plane selective fetch area using the whole pipe damage area
- mark the whole plane area damaged if plane visibility or alpha
changed

v5:
- taking in consideration src.y1 in the damage coordinates
- adding to the pipe damaged area planes that were visible but are
invisible in the new state

v6:
- consider old state plane coordinates when visibility changes or it
moved to calculate damaged area
- remove from damaged area the portion not in src clip

v7:
- intersec every damage clip with src to minimize damaged area

v8:
- adjust pipe_damaged area to 4 lines grouping
- adjust calculation now that is understood that uapi.src is the
framebuffer coordinates that plane will start to fetch from

v9:
- Only add plane dst or src to damaged_area if visible
- Early skip plane damage calculation if it was not visible in old and
new state
