drm/i915/guc: do not dump execlists state with GuC submission

GuC owns the execlists state and the context IDs used for submission, so
the status of the ports and the CSB entries are not something we control
or can decode from the i915 side, therefore we can avoid dumping it. A
follow-up patch will also stop setting the csb pointers when using GuC
submission.

GuC dumps all the required events in the GuC logs when verbosity is set
high enough.
