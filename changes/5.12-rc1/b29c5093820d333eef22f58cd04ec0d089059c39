s390/vtime: fix inline assembly clobber list

The stck/stckf instruction used within the inline assembly within
do_account_vtime() changes the condition code. This is not reflected
with the clobber list, and therefore might result in incorrect code
generation.

It seems unlikely that the compiler could generate incorrect code
considering the surrounding C code, but it must still be fixed.
