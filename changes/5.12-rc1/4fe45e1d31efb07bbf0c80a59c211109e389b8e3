net/mlx5: DR, Use HW specific logic API when writing STE

STEv0 format and STEv1 HW format are different, each has a
different order:
STEv0: CTRL 32B, TAG 16B, BITMASK 16B
STEv1: CTRL 32B, BITMASK 16B, TAG 16B

To make this transparent to upper layers we introduce a
new ste_ctx function to format the STE prior to writing it.
