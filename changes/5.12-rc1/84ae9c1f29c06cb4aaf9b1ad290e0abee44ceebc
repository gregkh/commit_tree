net/mlx5e: E-Switch, Maintain vhca_id to vport_num mapping

Following patches in the series need to be able to map VF netdev to vport.
Since it is trivial to obtain vhca_id from netdev, maintain mapping from
vhca_id to vport_num inside eswitch offloads using xarray. Provide function
mlx5_eswitch_vhca_id_to_vport() to be used by TC code in following patches
to obtain the mapping.
