binfmt_misc: pass binfmt_misc flags to the interpreter

It can be useful to the interpreter to know which flags are in use.

For instance, knowing if the preserve-argv[0] is in use would
allow to skip the pathname argument.

This patch uses an unused auxiliary vector, AT_FLAGS, to add a
flag to inform interpreter if the preserve-argv[0] is enabled.

Note by Helge Deller:
The real-world user of this patch is qemu-user, which needs to know
if it has to preserve the argv[0]. See Debian bug #970460.
