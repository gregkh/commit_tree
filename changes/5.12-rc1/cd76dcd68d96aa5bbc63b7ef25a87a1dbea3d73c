devlink: Support add and delete devlink port

Extended devlink interface for the user to add and delete a port.
Extend devlink to connect user requests to driver to add/delete
a port in the device.

Driver routines are invoked without holding devlink instance lock.
This enables driver to perform several devlink objects registration,
unregistration such as (port, health reporter, resource etc) by using
existing devlink APIs.
This also helps to uniformly use the code for port unregistration
during driver unload and during port deletion initiated by user.

Examples of add, show and delete commands:
$ devlink dev eswitch set pci/0000:06:00.0 mode switchdev

$ devlink port show
pci/0000:06:00.0/65535: type eth netdev ens2f0np0 flavour physical port 0 splittable false

$ devlink port add pci/0000:06:00.0 flavour pcisf pfnum 0 sfnum 88
pci/0000:06:00.0/32768: type eth netdev eth6 flavour pcisf controller 0 pfnum 0 sfnum 88 external false splittable false
  function:
    hw_addr 00:00:00:00:00:00 state inactive opstate detached

$ devlink port show pci/0000:06:00.0/32768
pci/0000:06:00.0/32768: type eth netdev eth6 flavour pcisf controller 0 pfnum 0 sfnum 88 external false splittable false
  function:
    hw_addr 00:00:00:00:00:00 state inactive opstate detached

$ udevadm test-builtin net_id /sys/class/net/eth6
