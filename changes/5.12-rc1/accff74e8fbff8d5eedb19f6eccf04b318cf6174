drm/amd/display: Set power_gated to true for seamless boot pipe init

[Why]
In seamless boot without a flip case, the flag power_gated didn't
get cleared when resetting path mode because the plane_state is null.
The following sequence will cause this issue:
    1. OS call set mode to clone/extended
    2. Reset path mode to remove edp

[How]
Set power gated default to true in seamless boot pipe
