net: mscc: ocelot: rebalance LAGs on link up/down events

At present there is an issue when ocelot is offloading a bonding
interface, but one of the links of the physical ports goes down. Traffic
keeps being hashed towards that destination, and of course gets dropped
on egress.

Monitor the netdev notifier events emitted by the bonding driver for
changes in the physical state of lower interfaces, to determine which
ports are active and which ones are no longer.

Then extend ocelot_get_bond_mask to return either the configured bonding
interfaces, or the active ones, depending on a boolean argument. The
code that does rebalancing only needs to do so among the active ports,
whereas the bridge forwarding mask and the logical port IDs still need
to look at the permanently bonded ports.
