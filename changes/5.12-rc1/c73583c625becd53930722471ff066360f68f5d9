arm64: dts: rockchip: cleanup cpu_thermal node of rk3399-rock960.dts

The cpu_thermal node in the rk3399-rock960.dts file does not
reference &cpu_thermal directly to add the board-specific parts,
but also repeats all the SoC default properties.
Clean the whole thing up and fix alignment.
Place new nodes in the correct alphabetical order.
Compered to rk3399.dtsi the temperature property in
cpu_alert0 changes from <70000> to <65000>.
A sustainable-power property was added.
The trip property in cooling map0 points to <&cpu_alert1>
instead of <&cpu_alert0>.
