ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: use hdac_ext fine-grained link management

Opt-in to use snd_hdac_ext_bus_link_power() to manage HDA link
power up/down events.

This allows to reduce power consumption in cases where some HDA codecs
are suspended, but other child devices (HDA or non-HDA codecs) remain
active and controller itself remains in active state.

By using snd_hdac_ext_bus_link_power(), the individual HDA links can be
powered off and if all HDA codecs are powered down, the command DMA can
also be shut down.
