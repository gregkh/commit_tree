xhci: avoid DMA double fetch when reading event trb type.

Instead of re-reading, masking and endianness correcting the same trb
several times to get the trb type from an event, just do it once and
store it in a local variable.

Also pass the trb_type directly to the vendor specific event handler,
avoiding one more similar read.

In addition to the security benefit this also cleans up the code
and helps readability.
