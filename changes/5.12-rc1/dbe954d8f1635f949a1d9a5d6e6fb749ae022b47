regulator: core: Avoid debugfs: Directory ... already present! error

Sometimes regulator_get() gets called twice for the same supply on the
same device. This may happen e.g. when a framework / library is used
which uses the regulator; and the driver itself also needs to enable
the regulator in some cases where the framework will not enable it.

Commit ff268b56ce8c ("regulator: core: Don't spew backtraces on
duplicate sysfs") already takes care of the backtrace which would
trigger when creating a duplicate consumer symlink under
/sys/class/regulator/regulator.%d in this scenario.

Commit c33d442328f5 ("debugfs: make error message a bit more verbose")
causes a new error to get logged in this scenario:

[   26.938425] debugfs: Directory 'wm5102-codec-MICVDD' with parent 'spi-WM510204:00-MICVDD' already present!

There is no _nowarn variant of debugfs_create_dir(), but we can detect
and avoid this problem by checking the return value of the earlier
sysfs_create_link_nowarn() call.

Add a check for the earlier sysfs_create_link_nowarn() failing with
-EEXIST and skip the debugfs_create_dir() call in that case, avoiding
this error getting logged.
