coresight: etm4x: Fix merge resolution for amba rework

This was non-trivial to get right because commits
c23bc382ef0e ("coresight: etm4x: Refactor probing routine") and
5214b563588e ("coresight: etm4x: Add support for sysreg only devices")
changed the code flow considerably. With this change the driver can be
built again.

Fixes: 0573d3fa4864 ("Merge branch 'devel-stable' of git://git.armlinux.org.uk/~rmk/linux-arm into char-misc-next")
