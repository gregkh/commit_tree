MIPS: zboot: head.S clean up

.cprestore is removed as we don't expect Position Independent
zboot ELF.

.noreorder is also removed and rest instructions are massaged
to improve readability.

t9 register is used for indirect jump as MIPS ABI requirement.

start label is removed as it already defined in LEAF.
