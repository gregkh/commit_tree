net: phy: micrel: Add KS8851 PHY support

The KS8851 has a reduced internal PHY, which is accessible through its
registers at offset 0xe4. The PHY is compatible with KS886x PHY present
in Micrel switches, including the PHY ID Low/High registers swap, which
is present both in the MAC and the switch.
