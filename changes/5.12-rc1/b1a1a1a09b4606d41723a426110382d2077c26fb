kbuild: lto: postpone objtool

With LTO, LLVM bitcode won't be compiled into native code until
modpost_link, or modfinal for modules. This change postpones calls
to objtool until after these steps, and moves objtool_args to
Makefile.lib, so the arguments can be reused in Makefile.modfinal.

As we didn't have objects to process earlier, we use --duplicate
when processing vmlinux.o. This change also disables unreachable
instruction warnings with LTO to avoid warnings about the int3
padding between functions.
