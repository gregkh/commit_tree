x86/reboot: Force all cpus to exit VMX root if VMX is supported

Force all CPUs to do VMXOFF (via NMI shootdown) during an emergency
reboot if VMX is _supported_, as VMX being off on the current CPU does
not prevent other CPUs from being in VMX root (post-VMXON).  This fixes
a bug where a crash/panic reboot could leave other CPUs in VMX root and
prevent them from being woken via INIT-SIPI-SIPI in the new kernel.

Fixes: d176720d34c7 ("x86: disable VMX on all CPUs on reboot")
