/dev/mem: Only set filp->f_mapping

When we care about pagecache maintenance, we need to make sure that
both f_mapping and i_mapping point at the right mapping.

But for iomem mappings we only care about the virtual/pte side of
things, so f_mapping is enough. Also setting inode->i_mapping was
confusing me as a driver maintainer, since in e.g. drivers/gpu we
don't do that. Per Dan this seems to be copypasta from places which do
care about pagecache consistency, but not needed. Hence remove it for
slightly less confusion.
