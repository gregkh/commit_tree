scsi: lpfc: Use the nvme-fc transport supplied timeout for LS requests

When lpfc generates a GEN_REQUEST wqe for the nvme LS (such as Create
Association), the timeout is set to R_A_TOV without regard to the timeout
value supplied by the nvme-fc transport. The driver should be setting the
timeout to the value passed into the routine. Additionally the caller
should be setting the timeout value to the value in the ls request set by
the nvme transport. Instead, it unconditionally is setting it to a driver
defined value.  So the driver actually overrode the value twice.

Fix by using the timeout provided to the routine, and for the caller, set
the timeout to the ls request timeout value.
