vgacon: drop BROKEN_GRAPHICS_PROGRAMS

BROKEN_GRAPHICS_PROGRAMS is defined when CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE=y. And
vgacon.c is built exclusively in that case too. So the check for
BROKEN_GRAPHICS_PROGRAMS is pointless in vgacon.c as it is always true.
So remove the test and BROKEN_GRAPHICS_PROGRAMS completely.

This also eliminates the need for vga_font_is_default global as it is
only set and never read.
