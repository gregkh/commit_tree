mm,thp,shm: limit gfp mask to no more than specified

Matthew Wilcox pointed out that the i915 driver opportunistically
allocates tmpfs memory, but will happily reclaim some of its pool if no
memory is available.

Make sure the gfp mask used to opportunistically allocate a THP is always
at least as restrictive as the original gfp mask.
