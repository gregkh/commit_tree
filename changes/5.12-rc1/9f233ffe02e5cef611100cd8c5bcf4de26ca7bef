Revert "bcache: Kill btree_io_wq"

This reverts commit 56b30770b27d54d68ad51eccc6d888282b568cee.

With the btree using the `system_wq`, I seem to see a lot more desktop
latency than I should.

After some more investigation, it looks like the original assumption
of 56b3077 no longer is true, and bcache has a very high potential of
congesting the `system_wq`. In turn, this introduces laggy desktop
performance, IO stalls (at least with btrfs), and input events may be
delayed.

So let's revert this. It's important to note that the semantics of
using `system_wq` previously mean that `btree_io_wq` should be created
before and destroyed after other bcache wqs to keep the same
assumptions.
