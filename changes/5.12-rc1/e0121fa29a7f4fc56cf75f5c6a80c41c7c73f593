KVM: x86: hyper-v: Rename vcpu_to_synic()/synic_to_vcpu()

vcpu_to_synic()'s argument is almost always 'vcpu' so there's no need to
have an additional prefix. Also, as this is used outside of hyper-v
emulation code, add '_hv_' part to make it clear what this s. This makes
the naming more consistent with to_hv_vcpu().

Rename synic_to_vcpu() to hv_synic_to_vcpu() for consistency.

No functional change intended.
