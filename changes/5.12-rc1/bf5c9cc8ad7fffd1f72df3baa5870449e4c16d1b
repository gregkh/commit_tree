mei: bus: change remove callback to return void

The driver core ignores the return value of mei_cl_device_remove() so
passing an error value doesn't solve any problem. As most mei drivers'
remove callbacks return 0 unconditionally and returning a different value
doesn't have any effect, change this prototype to return void and return 0
unconditionally in mei_cl_device_remove(). The only driver that could
return an error value is modified to emit an explicit warning in the error
case.
