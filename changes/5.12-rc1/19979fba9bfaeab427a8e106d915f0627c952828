KVM: x86: Remove obsolete disabling of page faults in kvm_arch_vcpu_put()

Remove the disabling of page faults across kvm_steal_time_set_preempted()
as KVM now accesses the steal time struct (shared with the guest) via a
cached mapping (see commit b043138246a4, "x86/KVM: Make sure
KVM_VCPU_FLUSH_TLB flag is not missed".)  The cache lookup is flagged as
atomic, thus it would be a bug if KVM tried to resolve a new pfn, i.e.
we want the splat that would be reached via might_fault().
