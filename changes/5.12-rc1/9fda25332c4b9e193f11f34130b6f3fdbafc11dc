media: i2c: imx258: get clock from device properties and enable it via runtime PM

The IMX258 sensor driver checked in device properties for a
clock-frequency property which actually does not mean that the clock is
really running such frequency or is it even enabled.

Get the provided clock and check it frequency.  If none is provided,
fall back to old property.

Enable the clock when accessing the IMX258 registers and when streaming
starts with runtime PM.
