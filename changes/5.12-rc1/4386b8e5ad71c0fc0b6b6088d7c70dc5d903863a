drm/i915/gt: Remove timeslice suppression

In the next^W future patch, we remove the strict priority system and
continuously re-evaluate the relative priority of tasks. As such we need
to enable the timeslice whenever there is more than one context in the
pipeline. This simplifies the decision and removes some of the tweaks to
suppress timeslicing, allowing us to lift the timeslice enabling to a
common spot at the end of running the submission tasklet.

One consequence of the suppression is that it was reducing fairness
between virtual engines on an over saturated system; undermining the
principle for timeslicing.

v2: Commentary
v3: Commentary for the right cancel_timer()
v4: Add tracing for why we need a timeslice
