ice: store the result of ice_rx_offset() onto ice_ring

Output of ice_rx_offset() is based on ethtool's priv flag setting, which
when changed, causes PF reset (disables napi, frees irqs, loads
different Rx mem model, etc.). This means that within napi its result is
constant and there is no reason to call it per each processed frame.

Add new 'rx_offset' field to ice_ring that is meant to hold the
ice_rx_offset() result and use it within ice_clean_rx_irq().
Furthermore, use it within ice_alloc_mapped_page().
