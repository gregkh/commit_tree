media: camss: Fix signedness bug in video_enum_fmt()

This test has a problem because we want to know if "k" is -1 or a
positive value less than "f->index".  But the "f->index" variable is a
u32 so if "k == -1" then -1 gets type promoted to UINT_MAX which is
larger than "f->index".  I've added an explicit test to check for -1.
