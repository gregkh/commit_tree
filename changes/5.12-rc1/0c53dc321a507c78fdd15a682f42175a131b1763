mmc: sdhci-of-aspeed: Add AST2600 bus clock support

The AST2600 can achieve HS200 speeds with a change to the bus clock
divisor behaviour. The divisor can also be more accurate with respect
to the requested clock rate, but keep the one-hot behaviour for
backwards compatibility with the AST2400 and AST2500.
