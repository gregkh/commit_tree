gfs2: Recursive gfs2_quota_hold in gfs2_iomap_end

When starting an iomap write, gfs2_quota_lock_check -> gfs2_quota_lock
-> gfs2_quota_hold is called from gfs2_iomap_begin.  At the end of the
write, before unlocking the quotas, punch_hole -> gfs2_quota_hold can be
called again in gfs2_iomap_end, which is incorrect and leads to a failed
assertion.  Instead, move the call to gfs2_quota_unlock before the call
to punch_hole to fix that.
