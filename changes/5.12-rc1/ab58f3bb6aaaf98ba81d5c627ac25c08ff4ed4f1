xhci: Avoid parsing transfer events several times

When handling transfer events the event is passed along the handling
callpath and parsed again in several occasions.

The event contains slot_id and endpoint index, from which the driver
endpoint structure can be found. There wasn't however a way to get the
endpoint index or parent usb device from this endpoint structure.

A lot of extra event parsing, and thus some DMA doublefetch cases,
and excess variables and code can be avoided by adding endpoint index
and parent usb virt device pointer to the endpoint structure.
