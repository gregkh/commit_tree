x86/xen: Support objtool vmlinux.o validation in xen-head.S

The Xen hypercall page is filled with zeros, causing objtool to fall
through all the empty hypercall functions until it reaches a real
function, resulting in a stack state mismatch.

The build-time contents of the hypercall page don't matter because the
page gets rewritten by the hypervisor.  Make it more palatable to
objtool by making each hypervisor function a true empty function, with
nops and a return.
