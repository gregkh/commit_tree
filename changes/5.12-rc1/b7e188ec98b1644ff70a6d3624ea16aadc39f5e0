mm/rmap: use page_not_mapped in try_to_unmap()

page_mapcount_is_zero() calculates accurately how many mappings a hugepage
has in order to check against 0 only.  This is a waste of cpu time.  We
can do this via page_not_mapped() to save some possible atomic_read
cycles.  Remove the function page_mapcount_is_zero() as it's not used
anymore and move page_not_mapped() above try_to_unmap() to avoid
identifier undeclared compilation error.
