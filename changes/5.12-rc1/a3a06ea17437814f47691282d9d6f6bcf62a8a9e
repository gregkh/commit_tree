mfd: iqs62x: Increase interrupt handler return delay

The time the device takes to deassert its RDY output following an
I2C stop condition scales with the core clock frequency.

To prevent level-triggered interrupts from being reasserted after
the interrupt handler returns, increase the time before returning
to account for the worst-case delay (~90 us) plus margin.
