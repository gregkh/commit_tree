platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: Add platform profile support

Add support to thinkpad_acpi for Lenovo platforms that have DYTC
version 5 support or newer to use the platform profile feature.

This will allow users to determine and control the platform modes
between low-power, balanced operation and performance modes.
