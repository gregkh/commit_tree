tty: fix up hung_up_tty_write() conversion

In commit "tty: implement write_iter", I left the write_iter conversion
of the hung up tty case alone, because I incorrectly thought it didn't
matter.

Jiri showed me the errors of my ways, and pointed out the problems with
that incomplete conversion.  Fix it all up.
