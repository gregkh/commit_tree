ARM: dts: bcm2711: Add reserved memory template to hold firmware configuration

RPi4's co-processor will copy the board's bootloader[1] configuration
into memory for the OS to consume. Specifically, for the bootloader
configuration and upgrade user-space routines to query it through
nvmem's sysfs interface.

Introduce a reserved-memory area template for the co-processor to edit
before booting the system so as for Linux not to overwrite that memory
and to expose it as an nvmem device.
