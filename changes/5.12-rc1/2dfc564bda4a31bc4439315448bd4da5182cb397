soc: renesas: rcar-sysc: Mark device node OF_POPULATED after init

The R-Car System Controller (SYSC) driver registers PM domains from an
early_initcall().  It does not use a platform driver, as secondary CPU
startup on R-Car H1 needs to control the CPU power domains, before
initialization of the driver framework.

As fw_devlink only considers devices, it does not know that the System
Controller is ready.  Hence probing of on-chip devices that are part of
the SYSC PM domain fails if fw_devlink is enabled:

    probe deferral - supplier e6180000.system-controller not ready

Fix this by setting the OF_POPULATED flag for the SYSC device node after
successful initialization.  This will make of_link_to_phandle() ignore
the SYSC device node as a dependency, and consumer devices will be
probed again.
