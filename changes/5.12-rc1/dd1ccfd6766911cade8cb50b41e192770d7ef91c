pinctrl: ingenic: Improve JZ4760 support

- Add otg function and otg-vbus group.

- Add lcd-8bit, lcd-16bit, lcd-18bit, lcd-generic and lcd-special
  groups. Change the lcd-24bit group so that it only selects the pins
  that aren't in the lcd-18bit and lcd-generic groups (which breaks
  Device Tree in theory, but there is none out there for any JZ4760
  based board, yet). Remove the lcd-no-pins group which is just useless.
