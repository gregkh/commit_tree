io-wq: fork worker threads from original task

Instead of using regular kthread kernel threads, create kernel threads
that are like a real thread that the task would create. This ensures that
we get all the context that we need, without having to carry that state
around. This greatly reduces the code complexity, and the risk of missing
state for a given request type.

With the move away from kthread, we can also dump everything related to
assigned state to the new threads.
