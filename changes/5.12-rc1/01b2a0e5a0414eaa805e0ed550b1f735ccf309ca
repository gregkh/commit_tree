can: mcp251xfd: mcp251xfd_probe(): remove known bad combinations from errata tabe

The published errata specify the maximum allowed SPI frequency to be
max 85% of (FSYSCLK/2). So there's no need to track known bad clock
settings in the driver. As the setup of known good values is a bit
tricky, keep them.
