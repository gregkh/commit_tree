staging: qlge: use qlge_* prefix to avoid namespace clashes with other qlogic drivers

To avoid namespace clashes with other qlogic drivers and also for the
sake of naming consistency, use the "qlge_" prefix as suggested in
drivers/staging/qlge/TODO,
 - For existing ql_ prefix,
   sed -i "s/ql_/qlge_/g" *.{c,h}
 - for structs not having a prefix
   1. get a list of structs
      grep "struct.*{" qlge.
   2. add qlge_ for each struct, e.g.,
      sed -i "s/ib_ae_iocb_rsp/qlge_ib_ae_iocb_rsp/g" *.{c,h}
