iwlwifi: mvm: send stored PPAG command instead of local

Some change conflicts apparently cause a confusion between a local
variable being used to send the PPAG command and the introduction of a
union for this command.  Most parts of the local command were never
copied from the stored data, so the FW was getting garbage in the
tables instead of getting valid values.

Fix this by completely removing the local and using only the union
that we have stored in fwrt.
