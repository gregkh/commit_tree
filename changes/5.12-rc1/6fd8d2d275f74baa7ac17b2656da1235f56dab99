ASoC: qcom: qdsp6: Move frontend AIFs to q6asm-dai

At the moment it is necessary to set up the DAPM routes between
front-end AIF<->DAI explicitly in the device tree, e.g. using

	audio-routing =
		"MM_DL1", "MultiMedia1 Playback",
		"MM_DL3", "MultiMedia3 Playback",
		"MM_DL4", "MultiMedia4 Playback",
		"MultiMedia2 Capture", "MM_UL2";

This is prone to mistakes and (sadly) there is no clear error if one
of these routes is missing. :(

Actually, this should not be necessary because the ASoC core normally
automatically links AIF<->DAI within snd_soc_dapm_link_dai_widgets().
This is done using the "stname" parameter of SND_SOC_DAPM_AIF_IN/OUT.

For SND_SOC_DAPM_AIF_IN("MM_DL1", "MultiMedia1 Playback", 0, 0, 0, 0),
it should create the route from above: MM_DL1 <-> MultiMedia1 Playback.

This does not work at the moment because the AIF widget (MM_DL1)
and the DAI widget (MultiMedia1 Playback) belong to different
DAPM contexts (q6routing / q6asm-dai).

Fix this by declaring the AIF widgets in the same driver as the DAIs
(q6asm-dai). Now the routes above are created automatically
and no longer need to be specified in the device tree.

This is also more consistent with the back-end AIFs which are already
declared in q6afe-dais instead of q6routing. q6routing should only link
the components together using mixers.
