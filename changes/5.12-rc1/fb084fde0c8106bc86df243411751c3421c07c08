objtool: Fully validate the stack frame

A valid stack frame should contain both the return address and the
previous frame pointer value.

On x86, the return value is placed on the stack by the calling
instructions. On other architectures, the callee needs to explicitly
save the return address on the stack.

Add the necessary checks to verify a function properly sets up all the
elements of the stack frame.
