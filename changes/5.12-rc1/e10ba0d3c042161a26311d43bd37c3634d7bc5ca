Input: iqs5xx - re-initialize device upon warm reset

The device may be inadvertently reset during runtime in the event
of ESD strike, etc. To protect against this case, acknowledge the
SHOW_RESET interrupt and re-initialize the device.

To facilitate this change, expand the range of registers that are
read in the interrupt handler to include the system status fields.

Also, update the unrelated (but nearby) SUSPEND register field to
use the BIT() macro. The remaining register fields are cleaned up
in another patch.
