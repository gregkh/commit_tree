xfs: Check for extent overflow when adding dir entries

Directory entry addition can cause the following,
1. Data block can be added/removed.
   A new extent can cause extent count to increase by 1.
2. Free disk block can be added/removed.
   Same behaviour as described above for Data block.
3. Dabtree blocks.
   XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH blocks can be added. Each of these
   can be new extents. Hence extent count can increase by
   XFS_DA_NODE_MAXDEPTH.
