arm64: Drop workaround for broken 'S' constraint with GCC 4.9

Since GCC < 5.1 has been shown to be unsuitable for the arm64 kernel,
let's drop the workaround for the 'S' asm constraint that GCC 4.9
doesn't always grok.

This is effectively a revert of 9fd339a45be5 ("arm64: Work around
broken GCC 4.9 handling of "S" constraint").
