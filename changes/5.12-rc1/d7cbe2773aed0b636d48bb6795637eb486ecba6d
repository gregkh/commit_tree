platform/x86: thinkpad_acpi: set keyboard language

This patch is to create sysfs entry for setting keyboard language
using ASL method. Some thinkpads models like T580 , T590 , T15 Gen 1
etc. has "=", "(',")" numeric keys, which are not displaying correctly,
when keyboard language is other than "english".
This patch fixes this issue by setting keyboard language to ECFW.
