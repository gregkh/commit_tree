media: venus: hfi: Correct session init return error

The hfi_session_init can be called many times and it returns
EINVAL when the session was already initialized. This error code
(EINVAL) is confusing for the callers. Change hfi_session_init to
return EALREADY error code when the session has been already
initialized.
