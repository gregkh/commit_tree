scsi: lpfc: Fix auto sli_mode and its effect on CONFIG_PORT for SLI3

A very long time ago, there was a feature: auto sli mode. It gave the user
the ability to auto select the SLI mode (SLI2 or SLI3) to run the port in,
or even force SLI2 mode if configured.  Because of the convoluted logic,
the CONFIG_PORT mbox command ends up being called 2 or 3 times. It should
have been called only once.  Additionally, the driver no longer supports
SLI-2, so only SLI-3 mode should be allowed.

The following changes were made:

 - Force module parameter to SLI3 only.

 - Rip out redundant CONFIG_PORT mbox commands.

 - Force CONFIG_PORT mbox command to be in beginning of enable ISR routine.

 - Added changes for offline to online behavior
