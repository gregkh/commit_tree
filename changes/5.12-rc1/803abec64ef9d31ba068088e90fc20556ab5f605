media: ipu3-cio2: Add cio2-bridge to ipu3-cio2 driver

Currently on platforms designed for Windows, connections between CIO2 and
sensors are not properly defined in DSDT. This patch extends the ipu3-cio2
driver to compensate by building software_node connections, parsing the
connection properties from the sensor's SSDB buffer.

[Sakari Ailus: Make cio2_bridge_init static inline to a fix compiler
	       warning, wrapped a bunch of long lines.]
