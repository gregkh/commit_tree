dt-bindings: serial: stm32: update rts-gpios and cts-gpios

Update rts-gpios and cts-gpios:
- remove max-items as already defined in serial.yaml
- add a note describing rts-gpios and cts-gpios usage with stm32

Document the use of cts-gpios and rts-gpios for flow control in STM32 UART
controller. These properties can be used instead of 'uart-has-rtscts' or
'st,hw-flow-ctrl' (deprecated) for making use of any gpio pins for flow
control instead of dedicated pins.
It should be noted that both cts-gpios/rts-gpios and 'uart-has-rtscts' or
'st,hw-flow-ctrl' (deprecated) properties cannot co-exist in a design.
