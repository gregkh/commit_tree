clk: at91: Fix the declaration of the clocks

These are all "early clocks" that require initialization just at
of_clk_init() time. Use CLK_OF_DECLARE() to declare them.

This also fixes a problem that was spotted when fw_devlink was
set to 'on' by default: the boards failed to boot. The reason is
that CLK_OF_DECLARE_DRIVER() clears the OF_POPULATED and causes
the consumers of the clock to be postponed by fw_devlink until
the second initialization routine of the clock has been completed.
One of the consumers of the clock is the timer, which is used as a
clocksource, and needs the clock initialized early. Postponing the
timers caused the fail at boot.
