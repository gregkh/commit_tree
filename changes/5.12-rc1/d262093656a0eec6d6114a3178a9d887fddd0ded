lib: stackdepot: add support to configure STACK_HASH_SIZE

Use CONFIG_STACK_HASH_ORDER to configure STACK_HASH_SIZE.

Aim is to have configurable value for  STACK_HASH_SIZE,
so depend on use case one can configure it.

One example is of Page Owner, CONFIG_PAGE_OWNER works only if
page_owner=on via kernel parameter on CONFIG_PAGE_OWNER configured system.
Thus, unless admin enable it via command line option, the stackdepot will
just waste 8M memory without any customer.

Making it configurable and use lower value helps to enable features like
CONFIG_PAGE_OWNER without any significant overhead.
