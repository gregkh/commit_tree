arm64: ptrace: Fix missing return in hw breakpoint code

When delivering a hw-breakpoint SIGTRAP to a compat task via ptrace, the
lack of a 'return' statement means we fallthrough to the native case,
which differs in its handling of 'si_errno'.

Although this looks to be harmless because the subsequent signal is
effectively ignored, it's confusing and unintentional, so add the
missing 'return'.
