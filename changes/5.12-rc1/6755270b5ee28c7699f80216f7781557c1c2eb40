s390/vdso: remove superfluous variables

A few local variables exist only so the contents of a global variable
can be copied to them, and use that value only for reading.
Just remove them and rename some global variables. Also change
vdso64_[start|end] to be character arrays to be consistent with other
architectures, and get rid of the global variable vdso64_kbase.
