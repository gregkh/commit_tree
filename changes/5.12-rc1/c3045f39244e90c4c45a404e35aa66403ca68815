iommu/mediatek: Support for multi domains

Some HW IP(ex: CCU) require the special iova range. That means the iova
got from dma_alloc_attrs for that devices must locate in his special range.
In this patch, we prepare a iommu group(domain) for each a iova range
requirement.

Meanwhile we still use one pagetable which support 16GB iova.

After this patch, If the iova range of a master is over 4G, the master
should:
a) Declare its special dma-ranges in its dtsi node. For example, If we
   preassign the iova 4G-8G for vcodec, then the vcodec dtsi node should
   add this:
   /*
    * iova start at 0x1_0000_0000, pa still start at 0x4000_0000
    * size is 0x1_0000_0000.
    */
   dma-ranges = <0x1 0x0 0x0 0x40000000 0x1 0x0>;  /* 4G ~ 8G */
 Note: we don't have a actual bus concept here. the master doesn't have its
 special parent node, thus this dma-ranges can only be put in the master's
 node.

b) Update the dma_mask:
  dma_set_mask_and_coherent(dev, DMA_BIT_MASK(33));
