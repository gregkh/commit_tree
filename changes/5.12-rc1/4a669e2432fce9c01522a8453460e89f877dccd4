drivers/perf: Add support for ARMv8.3-SPE

Armv8.3 extends the SPE by adding:
- Alignment field in the Events packet, and filtering on this event
  using PMSEVFR_EL1.
- Support for the Scalable Vector Extension (SVE).

The main additions for SVE are:
- Recording the vector length for SVE operations in the Operation Type
  packet. It is not possible to filter on vector length.
- Incomplete predicate and empty predicate fields in the Events packet,
  and filtering on these events using PMSEVFR_EL1.

Update the check of pmsevfr for empty/partial predicated SVE and
alignment event in SPE driver.
