wireguard: peer: put frequently used members above cache lines

The is_dead boolean is checked for every single packet, while the
internal_id member is used basically only for pr_debug messages. So it
makes sense to hoist up is_dead into some space formerly unused by a
struct hole, while demoting internal_api to below the lowest struct
cache line.
