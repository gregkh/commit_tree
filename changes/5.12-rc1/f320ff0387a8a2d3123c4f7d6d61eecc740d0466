mei: bus: simplify mei_cl_device_remove()

The driver core only calls a bus' remove function when there is actually
a driver and a device. So drop the needless check and assign cldrv earlier.

(Side note: The check for cldev being non-NULL is broken anyhow, because
to_mei_cl_device() is a wrapper around container_of() for a member that is
not the first one. So cldev only can become NULL if dev is (void *)0xc
(for archs with 32 bit pointers) or (void *)0x18 (for archs with 64 bit
pointers).)
