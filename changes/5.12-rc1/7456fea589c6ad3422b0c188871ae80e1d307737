i3c: Handle drivers without probe or remove callback

A registered driver without a probe callback doesn't make sense, so
refuse to register such a driver. (Otherwise i3c_device_probe() yields a
NULL pointer exception.)

A driver without remove is possible, e.g. when all resources are freed
using devm callbacks. So guard the call to driver->remove by a check
for being non-NULL.

Note that the only in-tree i3c driver
(drivers/iio/imu/st_lsm6dsx/st_lsm6dsx_i3c.c) doesn't have a remove
callback.
