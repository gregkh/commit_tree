ASoC: SOF: Intel: detect DMIC number in SoundWire mixed config

The pinmux allows for 2 SoundWire links to be enabled along with
DMICs. This was the default configuration on the TGL-RVP.

One issue with this configuration is that we don't have a means to
automatically detect how many DMICs are used, which in turn requires
the user to manually rename the topology file required on a platform.

This was borderline acceptable for Intel RVPs, but now that this
configuration is present in HP devices we need to automate the
process.

This patch makes use of the NHLT information and will pass the DMIC
number to the machine driver as a parameter. A follow-up patch will
expose the DMIC number to userspace/UCM with the configuration strings.

The Google devices do make use of DMICs instead of SoundWire link 2
and 3, but their topology is unique enough that they do not need any
NHTL support or topology renaming.
