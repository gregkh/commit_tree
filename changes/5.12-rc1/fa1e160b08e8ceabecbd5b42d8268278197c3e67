ia64: remove generated/nr-irqs.h generation to fix build warning

Randy reports the following warning when building ARCH=ia64 with
CONFIG_IA64_PALINFO=m:

../scripts/Makefile.build:68: 'arch/ia64/kernel/palinfo.ko' will not be built even though obj-m is specified.
../scripts/Makefile.build:69: You cannot use subdir-y/m to visit a module Makefile. Use obj-y/m instead.

This message is actually false-positive, and you can get palinfo.ko
correctly built. It is emitted in the archprepare stage, where Kbuild
descends into arch/ia64/kernel to generate include/generated/nr-irqs.h
instead of any kind of kernel objects.

arch/ia64/kernel/nr-irqs.c was introduced by commit 213060a4d699
("[IA64] pvops: paravirtualize NR_IRQS") to pre-calculate:

   NR_IRQS = max(IA64_NATIVE_NR_IRQS, XEN_NR_IRQS, FOO_NR_IRQS...)

Since commit d52eefb47d4e ("ia64/xen: Remove Xen support for ia64"), this
union contains just one field, making NR_IRQS and IA64_NATIVE_NR_IRQS
always match.

So, the following hard-coding now works:

  #define NR_IRQS                IA64_NATIVE_NR_IRQS

If you need to re-introduce NR_IRQS = max(...) gimmick in the future,
please try to implement it in asm-offsets.c instead of a separate file.
It will be possible because the header inclusion has been consolidated
to make asm-offsets.c independent of <asm/irqs.h>.
