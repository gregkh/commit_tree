KVM: SVM: Move AVIC vCPU kicking snippet to helper function

Add a helper function to handle kicking non-running vCPUs when sending
virtual IPIs.  A future patch will change SVM's interception functions
to take @vcpu instead of @svm, at which piont declaring and modifying
'vcpu' in a case statement is confusing, and potentially dangerous.

No functional change intended.
