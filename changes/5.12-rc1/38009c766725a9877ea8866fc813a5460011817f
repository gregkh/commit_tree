drivers/base: build kunit tests without structleak plugin

The structleak plugin causes the stack frame size to grow immensely:

drivers/base/test/property-entry-test.c: In function 'pe_test_reference':
drivers/base/test/property-entry-test.c:481:1: error: the frame size of 2640 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
  481 | }
      | ^
drivers/base/test/property-entry-test.c: In function 'pe_test_uints':
drivers/base/test/property-entry-test.c:99:1: error: the frame size of 2592 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]
