clk: qcom: gdsc: Implement NO_RET_PERIPH flag

In some rare occasions, we want to only set the RETAIN_MEM bit, but
not the RETAIN_PERIPH one: this is seen on at least SDM630/636/660's
GPU-GX GDSC, where unsetting and setting back the RETAIN_PERIPH bit
will generate chaos and panics during GPU suspend time (mainly, the
chaos is unaligned access).

For this reason, introduce a new NO_RET_PERIPH flag to the GDSC
driver to address this corner case.
