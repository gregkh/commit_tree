sched/core: Allow try_invoke_on_locked_down_task() with irqs disabled

The try_invoke_on_locked_down_task() function currently requires
that interrupts be enabled, but it is called with interrupts
disabled from rcu_print_task_stall(), resulting in an "IRQs not
enabled as expected" diagnostic.  This commit therefore updates
try_invoke_on_locked_down_task() to use raw_spin_lock_irqsave() instead
of raw_spin_lock_irq(), thus allowing use from either context.
