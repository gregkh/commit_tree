ACPI: OSL: Rework acpi_check_resource_conflict()

Rearrange the code in acpi_check_resource_conflict() so as to drop
redundant checks and uneeded local variables from there and modify
the messages printed by that function to be more concise and
hopefully easier to understand.

While at it, replace direct printk() usage with pr_*().
