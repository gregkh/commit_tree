btrfs: zoned: wait for existing extents before truncating

When truncating a file, file buffers which have already been allocated
but not yet written may be truncated. Truncating these buffers could
cause breakage of a sequential write pattern in a block group if the
truncated blocks are for example followed by blocks allocated to another
file. To avoid this problem, always wait for write out of all unwritten
buffers before proceeding with the truncate execution.
