usb: chipidea: tegra: Remove MODULE_ALIAS

The OF core adds an alias based on the OF device ID table, which is enough
to have the driver autoloaded. The legacy MODULE_ALIAS macro was relevant
to a pre-OF board files which manually created platform devices, this is
irrelevant to the modern ARM kernels since devices are created by the OF
core. Remove the unnecessary macro in order to keep the driver's code
cleaner.
