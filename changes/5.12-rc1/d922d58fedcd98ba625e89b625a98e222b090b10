drm/panel: kd35t133: allow using non-continuous dsi clock

The panel is able to work when dsi clock is non-continuous, thus
the system power consumption can be reduced using such feature.

Add MIPI_DSI_CLOCK_NON_CONTINUOUS to panel's mode_flags.

Also the flag actually becomes necessary after
commit c6d94e37bdbb ("drm/bridge/synopsys: dsi: add support for non-continuous HS clock")
and without it the panel only emits stripes instead of output.
