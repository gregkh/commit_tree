net: fix up truesize of cloned skb in skb_prepare_for_shift()

Avoid the assumption that ksize(kmalloc(S)) == ksize(kmalloc(S)): when
cloning an skb, save and restore truesize after pskb_expand_head(). This
can occur if the allocator decides to service an allocation of the same
size differently (e.g. use a different size class, or pass the
allocation on to KFENCE).

Because truesize is used for bookkeeping (such as sk_wmem_queued), a
modified truesize of a cloned skb may result in corrupt bookkeeping and
relevant warnings (such as in sk_stream_kill_queues()).
