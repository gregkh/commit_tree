arm64: dts: hisilicon: avoid irrelevant nodes being mistakenly identified as PHY nodes

Currently, the names of several nodes incorrectly match common PHY
provider schema. And the phy-provider.yaml requires them must have
property "#phy-cells". As a result, false positives similar to the
following are reported:
usb2-phy@120: '#phy-cells' is a required property

Change their names slightly so that they do not match pattern:
"^(|usb-|usb2-|usb3-|pci-|pcie-|sata-)phy(@[0-9a-f,]+)*$".
