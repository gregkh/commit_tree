s390/pci: remove superfluous zdev->zbus check

Checking zdev->zbus for NULL in __zpci_event_availability() is
superfluous as it can never be NULL at this point. While harmless this
check causes smatch warnings because we later access zdev->zbus with
only having checked zdev != NULL which is sufficient.

The reason zdev->zbus can never be NULL is since with zdev != NULL given
we know the zdev came from get_zdev_by_fid() and thus the zpci_list.
Now on first glance at zpci_create_device() one may assume that there is
a window where the zdev is in the list without a zdev, however this
window can't overlap with __zpci_event_availability() as
zpci_create_device() either runs on the same kthread as part of
availability events, or during the initial CLP List PCI at which point
the __zpci_event_availability() is not yet called as zPCI is not yet
initialized.
