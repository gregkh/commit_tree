rcu: Add lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled() to rcu_sched_clock_irq() and callees

This commit adds a number of lockdep_assert_irqs_disabled() calls
to rcu_sched_clock_irq() and a number of the functions that it calls.
The point of this is to help track down a situation where lockdep appears
to be insisting that interrupts are enabled within these functions, which
should only ever be invoked from the scheduling-clock interrupt handler.
