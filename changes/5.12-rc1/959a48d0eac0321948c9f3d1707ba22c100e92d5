PCI: endpoint: Make *_get_first_free_bar() take into account 64 bit BAR

pci_epc_get_first_free_bar() uses only "reserved_bar" member in
epc_features to get the first unreserved BAR. However if the reserved BAR
is also a 64-bit BAR, then the next BAR shouldn't be returned (since 64-bit
BAR uses two BARs).

Make pci_epc_get_first_free_bar() take into account 64 bit BAR while
returning the first free unreserved BAR.
