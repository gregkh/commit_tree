drm/i915/gem: Move stolen node into GEM object union

The obj->stolen is currently used to identify an object allocated from
stolen memory. This dates back to when there were just 1.5 types of
objects, an object backed by shmemfs and an object backed by shmemfs
with a contiguous physical address. Now that we have several different
types of objects, we no longer want to treat stolen objects as a special
case.
