USB: cdc-acm: ignore Exar XR21V141X when serial driver is built

The Exar XR21V141X can be used in either ACM mode using the cdc-acm
driver or in "custom driver" mode in which further features such as
hardware and software flow control, GPIO control and in-band line-status
reporting are available.

In ACM mode the device always enables RTS/CTS flow control, something
which could prevent transmission in case the CTS input isn't wired up
correctly.

Ensure that cdc_acm will not bind to the device if the custom USB-serial
driver is enabled.
