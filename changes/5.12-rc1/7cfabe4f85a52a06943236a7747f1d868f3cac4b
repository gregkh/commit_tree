arcnet: fix macro name when DEBUG is defined

When DEBUG is defined this error occurs

drivers/net/arcnet/com20020_cs.c:70:15: error: ‘com20020_REG_W_ADDR_HI’
  undeclared (first use in this function);
  did you mean ‘COM20020_REG_W_ADDR_HI’?
       ioaddr, com20020_REG_W_ADDR_HI);
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

From reviewing the context, the suggestion is what is meant.
