btrfs: zoned: implement sequential extent allocation

Implement a sequential extent allocator for zoned filesystems. This
allocator only needs to check if there is enough space in the block group
after the allocation pointer to satisfy the extent allocation request.
Therefore the allocator never manages bitmaps or clusters. Also, add
assertions to the corresponding functions.

As zone append writing is used, it would be unnecessary to track the
allocation offset, as the allocator only needs to check available space.
But by tracking and returning the offset as an allocated region, we can
skip modification of ordered extents and checksum information when there
is no IO reordering.
