ARM: s3c: fix fiq for clang IAS

Building with the clang integrated assembler produces a couple of
errors for the s3c24xx fiq support:

  arch/arm/mach-s3c/irq-s3c24xx-fiq.S:52:2: error: instruction 'subne' can not set flags, but 's' suffix specified
    subnes pc, lr, #4 @@ return, still have work to do

  arch/arm/mach-s3c/irq-s3c24xx-fiq.S:64:1: error: invalid symbol redefinition
    s3c24xx_spi_fiq_txrx:

There are apparently two problems: one with extraneous or duplicate
labels, and one with old-style opcode mnemonics. Stefan Agner has
previously fixed other problems like this, but missed this particular
file.
