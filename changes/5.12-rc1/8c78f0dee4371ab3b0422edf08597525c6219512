hwmon: Add AHT10 Temperature and Humidity Sensor Driver

This patch adds a hwmon driver for the AHT10 Temperature and
Humidity sensor. It has a maximum sample rate, as the datasheet
states that the chip may heat up if it is sampled more than once
every two seconds.

Has been tested a to work on a raspberrypi0w
