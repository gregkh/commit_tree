drm/i915: Disable TRAINING_PATTERN_SET before stopping the TPS transmission

DP spec says:
"The Source device shall start sending the idle pattern after
 it has cleared the Training_Pattern byte in the DPCD."

Currently we do these in operations in the opposite order.
Swap them around to match the spec.
