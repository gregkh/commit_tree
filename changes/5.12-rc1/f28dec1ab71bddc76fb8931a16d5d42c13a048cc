clk: qcom: Add SDX55 APCS clock controller support

Add a driver for the SDX55 APCS clock controller. It is part of the APCS
hardware block, which among other things implements also a combined mux
and half integer divider functionality. The APCS clock controller has 3
parent clocks:

1. Board XO
2. Fixed rate GPLL0
3. A7 PLL

This is required for enabling CPU frequency scaling on SDX55-based
platforms.
