exfat: improve performance of exfat_free_cluster when using dirsync mount option

There are stressful update of cluster allocation bitmap when using
dirsync mount option which is doing sync buffer on every cluster bit
clearing. This could result in performance degradation when deleting
big size file.
Fix to update only when the bitmap buffer index is changed would make
less disk access, improving performance especially for truncate operation.

Testing with Samsung 256GB sdcard, mounted with dirsync option
(mount -t exfat /dev/block/mmcblk0p1 /temp/mount -o dirsync)

Remove 4GB file, blktrace result.
