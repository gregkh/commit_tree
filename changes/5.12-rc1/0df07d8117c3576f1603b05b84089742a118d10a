crypto: arm64/sha - add missing module aliases

The accelerated, instruction based implementations of SHA1, SHA2 and
SHA3 are autoloaded based on CPU capabilities, given that the code is
modest in size, and widely used, which means that resolving the algo
name, loading all compatible modules and picking the one with the
highest priority is taken to be suboptimal.

However, if these algorithms are requested before this CPU feature
based matching and autoloading occurs, these modules are not even
considered, and we end up with suboptimal performance.

So add the missing module aliases for the various SHA implementations.
