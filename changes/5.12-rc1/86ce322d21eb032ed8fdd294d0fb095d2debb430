selftests/bpf: Don't exit on failed bpf_testmod unload

Fix bug in handling bpf_testmod unloading that will cause test_progs exiting
prematurely if bpf_testmod unloading failed. This is especially problematic
when running a subset of test_progs that doesn't require root permissions and
doesn't rely on bpf_testmod, yet will fail immediately due to exit(1) in
unload_bpf_testmod().
