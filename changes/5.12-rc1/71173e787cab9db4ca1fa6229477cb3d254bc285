drm/scheduler: Essentialize the job done callback

The job done callback is called from various
places, in two ways: in job done role, and
as a fence callback role.

Essentialize the callback to an atom
function to just complete the job,
and into a second function as a prototype
of fence callback which calls to complete
the job.

This is used in latter patches by the completion
code.
