platform/surface: aggregator: Add dedicated bus and device type

The Surface Aggregator EC provides varying functionality, depending on
the Surface device. To manage this functionality, we use dedicated
client devices for each subsystem or virtual device of the EC. While
some of these clients are described as standard devices in ACPI and the
corresponding client drivers can be implemented as platform drivers in
the kernel (making use of the controller API already present), many
devices, especially on newer Surface models, cannot be found there.

To simplify management of these devices, we introduce a new bus and
client device type for the Surface Aggregator subsystem. The new device
type takes care of managing the controller reference, essentially
guaranteeing its validity for as long as the client device exists, thus
alleviating the need to manually establish device links for that purpose
in the client driver (as has to be done with the platform devices).
