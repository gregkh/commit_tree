RDMA/srp: Fix support for unpopulated and unbalanced NUMA nodes

The current code computes a number of channels per SRP target and spreads
them equally across all online NUMA nodes.  Each channel is then assigned
a CPU within this node.

In the case of unbalanced, or even unpopulated nodes, some channels do not
get a CPU associated and thus do not get connected.  This causes the SRP
connection to fail.

This patch solves the issue by rewriting channel computation and
allocation:

- Drop channel to node/CPU association as it had no real effect on
  locality but added unnecessary complexity.

- Tweak the number of channels allocated to reduce CPU contention when
  possible:
  - Up to one channel per CPU (instead of up to 4 by node)
  - At least 4 channels per node, unless ch_count module parameter is
    used.
