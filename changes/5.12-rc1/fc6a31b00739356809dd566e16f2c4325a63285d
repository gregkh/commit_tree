HID: i2c-hid: Add I2C_HID_QUIRK_NO_IRQ_AFTER_RESET for ITE8568 EC on Voyo Winpad A15

The ITE8568 EC on the Voyo Winpad A15 presents itself as an I2C-HID
attached keyboard and mouse (which seems to never send any events).

This needs the I2C_HID_QUIRK_NO_IRQ_AFTER_RESET quirk, otherwise we get
the following errors:

[ 3688.770850] i2c_hid i2c-ITE8568:00: failed to reset device.
[ 3694.915865] i2c_hid i2c-ITE8568:00: failed to reset device.
[ 3701.059717] i2c_hid i2c-ITE8568:00: failed to reset device.
[ 3707.205944] i2c_hid i2c-ITE8568:00: failed to reset device.
[ 3708.227940] i2c_hid i2c-ITE8568:00: can't add hid device: -61
[ 3708.236518] i2c_hid: probe of i2c-ITE8568:00 failed with error -61

Which leads to a significant boot delay.
