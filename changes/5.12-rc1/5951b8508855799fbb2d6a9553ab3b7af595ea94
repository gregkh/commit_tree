USB: serial: cp210x: suppress modem-control errors

The CP210X_SET_MHS request cannot be used to control RTS when hardware
flow control (auto-RTS) is enabled and instead returns an error which is
currently logged as:

	cp210x ttyUSB0: failed set request 0x7 status: -32

when opening and closing a port (and on TIOCMSET requests).

Add a crtscts flag to keep track of the hardware flow-control setting
and use it to suppress any request to change RTS when auto-RTS is
enabled.

Note that RTS is still deasserted when disabling the UART as part of
close.
