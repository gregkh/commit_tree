misc: bcm-vk: add autoload support

Add support to load and boot images on card automatically.
The kernel module parameter auto_load can be passed in as false to disable
such support on probe.
As well, nr_scratch_pages can be specified to allocate more or less scratch
memory on init as needed for desired card operation.
