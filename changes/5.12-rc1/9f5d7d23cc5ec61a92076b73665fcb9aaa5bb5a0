IMA: extend critical data hook to limit the measurement based on a label

The IMA hook ima_measure_critical_data() does not support a way to
specify the source of the critical data provider.  Thus, the data
measurement cannot be constrained based on the data source label
in the IMA policy.

Extend the IMA hook ima_measure_critical_data() to support passing
the data source label as an input parameter, so that the policy rule can
be used to limit the measurements based on the label.
