power: supply: cpcap-battery: Use charger status for battery full detection

We now get battery full notification from cpcap-charger, so let's use that
for battery full status and charger disconnect.

Note that any current based battery full detection we have tried earlier is
flakey as it won't account for example for CPU load increasing the battery
current. Anyways, if current based battery full detection is also still
needed, we can reconsider adding it in addition to the charger status based
detection.
