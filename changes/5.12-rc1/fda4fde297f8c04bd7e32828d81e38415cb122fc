net: ip_tunnel: clean up endianness conversions

sparse complains about some harmless endianness issues:

> net/ipv4/ip_tunnel_core.c:225:43: warning: cast to restricted __be16
> net/ipv4/ip_tunnel_core.c:225:43: warning: incorrect type in initializer (different base types)
> net/ipv4/ip_tunnel_core.c:225:43:    expected restricted __be16 [usertype] mtu
> net/ipv4/ip_tunnel_core.c:225:43:    got unsigned short [usertype]

iptunnel_pmtud_build_icmp() uses the wrong flavour of byte-order conversion
when storing the MTU into the ICMPv4 packet. Use htons(), just like
iptunnel_pmtud_build_icmpv6() does.

eth_header() wants the Ethertype in host-order, use the correct flavour of
byte-order conversion.

The TUNNEL_* types are big-endian, so adjust the type of the local
variable in ip_tun_parse_opts().
