net/mlx5e: Enable striding RQ for Connect-X IPsec capable devices

This limitation was inherited by previous Innova (FPGA) IPsec
implementation, it uses its private set of RQ handlers which does
not support striding rq, for Connect-X this is no longer true.

Fix by keeping this limitation only for Innova IPsec supporting devices,
as otherwise this limitation effectively wrongly blocks striding RQs for
all future Connect-X devices for all flows even if IPsec offload is not
used.
