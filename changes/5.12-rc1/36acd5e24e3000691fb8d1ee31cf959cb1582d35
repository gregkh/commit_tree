phy: lantiq: rcu-usb2: wait after clock enable

Commit 65dc2e725286 ("usb: dwc2: Update Core Reset programming flow.")
revealed that the phy isn't ready immediately after enabling it's
clocks. The dwc2_check_core_version() fails and the dwc2 usb driver
errors out.

Add a short delay to let the phy get up and running. There isn't any
documentation how much time is required, the value was chosen based on
tests.
