vmlinux.lds.h: Define SANTIZER_DISCARDS with CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL=y

clang produces .eh_frame sections when CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL is enabled,
even when -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables is in KBUILD_CFLAGS:

$ make CC=clang vmlinux
...
ld: warning: orphan section `.eh_frame' from `init/main.o' being placed in section `.eh_frame'
ld: warning: orphan section `.eh_frame' from `init/version.o' being placed in section `.eh_frame'
ld: warning: orphan section `.eh_frame' from `init/do_mounts.o' being placed in section `.eh_frame'
ld: warning: orphan section `.eh_frame' from `init/do_mounts_initrd.o' being placed in section `.eh_frame'
ld: warning: orphan section `.eh_frame' from `init/initramfs.o' being placed in section `.eh_frame'
ld: warning: orphan section `.eh_frame' from `init/calibrate.o' being placed in section `.eh_frame'
ld: warning: orphan section `.eh_frame' from `init/init_task.o' being placed in section `.eh_frame'
...

$ rg "GCOV_KERNEL|GCOV_PROFILE_ALL" .config
CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL=y
CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL=y
CONFIG_GCOV_PROFILE_ALL=y

This was already handled for a couple of other options in
commit d812db78288d ("vmlinux.lds.h: Avoid KASAN and KCSAN's unwanted
sections") and there is an open LLVM bug for this issue. Take advantage
of that section for this config as well so that there are no more orphan
warnings.
