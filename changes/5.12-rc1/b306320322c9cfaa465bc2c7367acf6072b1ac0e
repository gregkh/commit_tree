spi: Skip zero-length transfers in spi_transfer_one_message()

With the introduction of 26751de25d25 ("spi: bcm2835: Micro-optimise
FIFO loops") it has become apparent that some users might initiate
zero-length SPI transfers. A fact the micro-optimization omitted, and
which turned out to cause crashes[1].

Instead of changing the micro-optimization itself, use a bigger hammer
and skip zero-length transfers altogether for drivers using the default
transfer_one_message() implementation.
