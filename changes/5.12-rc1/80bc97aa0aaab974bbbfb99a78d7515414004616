net/af_iucv: don't track individual TX skbs for TRANS_HIPER sockets

Stop maintaining the skb_send_q list for TRANS_HIPER sockets.

Not only is it extra overhead, but keeping around a list of skb clones
means that we later also have to match the ->sk_txnotify() calls
against these clones and free them accordingly.
The current matching logic (comparing the skbs' shinfo location) is
frustratingly fragile, and breaks if the skb's head is mangled in any
sort of way while passing from dev_queue_xmit() to the device's
HW queue.

Also adjust the interface for ->sk_txnotify(), to make clear that we
don't actually care about any skb internals.
