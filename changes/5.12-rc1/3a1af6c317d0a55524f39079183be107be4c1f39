xfs: refactor common transaction/inode/quota allocation idiom

Create a new helper xfs_trans_alloc_inode that allocates a transaction,
locks and joins an inode to it, and then reserves the appropriate amount
of quota against that transction.  Then replace all the open-coded
idioms with a single call to this helper.
