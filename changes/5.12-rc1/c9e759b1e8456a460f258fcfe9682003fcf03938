tracing: Rework synthetic event command parsing

Now that command parsing has been delegated to the create functions
and we're no longer constrained by argv_split(), we can modify the
synthetic event command parser to better match the higher-level
structure of the synthetic event commands, which is basically an event
name followed by a set of semicolon-separated fields.

Since we're also now passed the raw command, we can also save it
directly and can get rid of save_cmdstr().
