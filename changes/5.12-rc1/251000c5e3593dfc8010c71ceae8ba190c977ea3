MAINTAINERS: update email address for Henrique de Moraes Holschuh

Update my email address in MAINTAINERS to the one I have been using for
commits, Signed-off-by and Acked-by tags.  Only two ancient commits had
the old ibm-acpi@hmh.eng.br, so it is unlikely to justify a .mailmap
entry.

Note that ibm-acpi@hmh.eng.br does work as a way to contact me, but
apparently it is best when MAINTAINERS entries match commit email
addresses ;-)
