net/mlx5: Fix health error state handling

Currently, when we discover a fatal error, we are queueing a work that
will wait for a lock in order to enter the device to error state.
Meanwhile, FW commands are still being processed, and gets timeouts.
This can block the driver for few minutes before the work will manage
to get the lock and enter to error state.

Setting the device to error state before queueing health work, in order
to avoid FW commands being processed while the work is waiting for the
lock.
