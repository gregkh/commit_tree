staging: rtl8723bs: remove unused structures

Building this with 'make W=1' produces a couple of warnings:

rtl8723bs/include/ieee80211.h:730:1: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct ieee80211_assoc_request_frame' is less than 2 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]
rtl8723bs/include/ieee80211.h:737:1: warning: alignment 1 of 'struct ieee80211_assoc_response_frame' is less than 2 [-Wpacked-not-aligned]

The warnings are in dead code, so just remove the bits that
are obviously broken like this.
