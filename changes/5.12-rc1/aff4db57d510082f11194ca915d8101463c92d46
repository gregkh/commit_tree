xfs: Remove duplicate assert statement in xfs_bmap_btalloc()

The check for verifying if the allocated extent is from an AG whose
index is greater than or equal to that of tp->t_firstblock is already
done a couple of statements earlier in the same function. Hence this
commit removes the redundant assert statement.
