RDMA/mlx5: Allow CQ creation without attached EQs

The traditional DevX CQ creation flow goes through mlx5_core_create_cq()
which checks that the given EQN corresponds to an existing EQ and attaches
a devx handler to the EQN for the CQ.

In some cases the EQ will not be a kernel EQ, but will be controlled by
modify CQ, don't block creating these just because the EQN can't be found
in the kernel.
