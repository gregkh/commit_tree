spi: stm32: defer probe for reset

Defer the probe operation when a reset controller device is expected
but have not yet been probed.

This change replaces use of devm_reset_control_get_exclusive() with
devm_reset_control_get_optional_exclusive() as reset controller is
optional which is now explicitly stated.
