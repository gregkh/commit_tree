ARM: dts: qcom: add additional DT labels in qcom-ipq8064.dtsi

This adds some additional DT labels which are handy when referring
to the nodes in derived DTS(I) files. It will also make the
definitions more consistent, e.g. by adding gsbi2_serial and
gsbi5_serial where we previously "only" had gsbi4_serial defined.

While at it, add missing spaces after some DT labels and remove one
useless empty line.
