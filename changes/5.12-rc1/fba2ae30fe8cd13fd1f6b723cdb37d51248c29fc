ACPI: utils: Clean up printing messages

Replace all of the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() instances in utils.c with
pr_debug() and acpi_handle_debug(), drop the _COMPONENT and
ACPI_MODULE_NAME() definitions that are not used any more and
replace direct printk() invocations with pr_debug() calls (the log
level in there is way excessive).

Also add a special pr_fmt() definition, but this only affects the
pr_debug() messages mentioned above.
