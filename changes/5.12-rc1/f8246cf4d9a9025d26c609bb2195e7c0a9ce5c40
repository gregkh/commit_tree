drm/i915/gem: Drop free_work for GEM contexts

The free_list and worker was introduced in commit 5f09a9c8ab6b ("drm/i915:
Allow contexts to be unreferenced locklessly"), but subsequently made
redundant by the removal of the last sleeping lock in commit 2935ed5339c4
("drm/i915: Remove logical HW ID"). As we can now free the GEM context
immediately from any context, remove the deferral of the free_list

v2: Lift removing the context from the global list into close().
