hugetlbfs: remove special hugetlbfs_set_page_dirty()

Matthew Wilcox noticed that hugetlbfs_set_page_dirty always returns 0.
Instead, it should return 1 or 0 depending on the previous state of the
dirty bit.  In addition, the call to compound_head is redundant as it is
also performed in calling routine set_page_dirty.

Replace the hugetlbfs specific routine hugetlbfs_set_page_dirty with
__set_page_dirty_no_writeback as it addresses both of these issues.
