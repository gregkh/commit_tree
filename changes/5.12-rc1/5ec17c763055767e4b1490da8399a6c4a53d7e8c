drm/i915/gt: Another tweak for flushing the tasklets

tasklet_kill() ensures that we _yield_ the processor until a remote
tasklet is completed. However, this leads to a starvation condition as
being at the bottom of the scheduler's runqueue means that anything else
is able to run, including all hogs keeping the tasklet occupied.
