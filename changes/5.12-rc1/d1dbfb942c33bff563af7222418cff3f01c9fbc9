xhci: introduce a new move_dequeue_past_td() function to replace old code.

Replace xhci_find_new_dequeue_state() and xhci_queue_new_dequeue_state()
functions with one combined function.
These function were always called after each other, and had a lot of extra
code just to pass the newly found dequeue state from the first function
to the other.

The new function also returns error in case there is a failure to
queue the new dequeue state. This way the caller can decide on
recovery measures to handle it.
