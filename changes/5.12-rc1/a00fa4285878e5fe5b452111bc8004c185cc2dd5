drm: panel: Fully transition panel_desc kerneldoc to inline style

In commit 131f909ad55f ("drm: panel: simple: Fixup the struct
panel_desc kernel doc") I transitioned the more deeply nested
kerneldoc comments into the inline style.  Apparently it is desirable
to continue the job and move _everything_ in this struct to inline.
Let's do it.

While doing this, we also add a short summary for the whole struct to
fix a warning when we run with extra warnings, AKA:
  scripts/kernel-doc -v -rst drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-simple.c

The warning was:
  drivers/gpu/drm/panel/panel-simple.c:42: warning: missing initial short description on line:
   * struct panel_desc
