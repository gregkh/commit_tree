i3c: Make remove callback return void

The driver core ignores the return value of struct bus_type::remove()
because there is only little that can be done. To simplify the quest to
make this function return void, let struct i3c_driver::remove() return
void, too. This makes it obvious that returning an error code is
a bad idea and future driver authors cannot get that wrong.

Up to now there are no drivers with a remove callback, so there is no
need to adapt drivers.
