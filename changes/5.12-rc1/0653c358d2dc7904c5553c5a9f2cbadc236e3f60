scsi: Drop gdth driver

The gdth driver refers to a SCSI parallel, PCI-only HBA RAID adapter which
was manufactured by the now-defunct ICP Vortex company, later acquired by
Adaptec and superseded by the aacraid series of controllers.  The driver
itself would require a major overhaul before any modifications can be
attempted, but seeing that it's unlikely to have any users left it should
rather be removed completely.
