mm/compaction: remove rcu_read_lock during page compaction

isolate_migratepages_block() used rcu_read_lock() with the intention of
safeguarding against the mem_cgroup being destroyed concurrently; but
its TestClearPageLRU already protects against that.  Delete the
unnecessary rcu_read_lock() and _unlock().
