pwm: rockchip: Enable APB clock during register access while probing

Commit 457f74abbed0 ("pwm: rockchip: Keep enabled PWMs running while
probing") modified rockchip_pwm_probe() to access a PWM device's registers
directly to check whether or not the device is enabled, but did not also
change the function so it first enables the device's APB clock to be
certain the device can respond. This risks hanging the kernel on systems
with PWM devices that use more than a single clock.

Avoid this by enabling the device's APB clock before accessing its
registers (and disabling the clock when register access is complete).
