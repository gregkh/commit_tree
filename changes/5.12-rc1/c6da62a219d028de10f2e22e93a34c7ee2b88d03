thunderbolt: Add support for native USB4 _OSC

ACPI 6.4 introduced a new _OSC capability used to negotiate whether the
OS is supposed to use Software (native) or Firmware based Connection
Manager. If the native support is granted then there are set of bits
that enable/disable different tunnel types that the Software Connection
Manager is allowed to tunnel.

This adds support for this new USB4 _OSC accordingly. When PCIe
tunneling is disabled then the driver switches security level to be
"nopcie" following the security level 5 used in Firmware based
Connection Manager.
