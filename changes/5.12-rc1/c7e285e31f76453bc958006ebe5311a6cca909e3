hugetlbfs: correct obsolete function name in hugetlbfs_read_iter()

Since commit 36e789144267 ("kill do_generic_mapping_read"), the function
do_generic_mapping_read() is renamed to do_generic_file_read(). And then
commit 47c27bc46946 ("fs: pass iocb to do_generic_file_read") renamed it
to generic_file_buffered_read(). So replace do_generic_mapping_read() with
generic_file_buffered_read() to keep comment uptodate.
