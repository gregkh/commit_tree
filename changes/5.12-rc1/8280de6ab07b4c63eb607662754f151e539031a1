usb: gadget: composite: Split composite reset and disconnect

Add a specific composite reset API to differentiate between disconnect and
reset events.  This is needed for adjusting the current draw accordingly
based on the USB battery charging specification.  The device is only allowed
to draw the 500/900 mA (HS/SS) while in the CONFIGURED state, and only 100 mA
in the connected and UNCONFIGURED state.
