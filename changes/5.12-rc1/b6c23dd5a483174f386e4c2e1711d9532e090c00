io_uring: run task_work on io_uring_register()

Do run task_work before io_uring_register(), that might make a first
quiesce round much nicer. We generally do that for any syscall invocation
to avoid spurious -EINTR/-ERESTARTSYS, for task_work that we generate.
This patch brings io_uring_register() inline with the two other io_uring
syscalls.
