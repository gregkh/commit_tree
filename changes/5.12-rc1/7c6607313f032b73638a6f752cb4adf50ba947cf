io_uring: consolidate putting reqs task

We grab a task for each request and while putting it it also have to do
extra work like inflight accounting and waking up that task. This
sequence is duplicated several time, it's good time to add a helper.
More to that, the helper generates better code due to better locality
and so not failing alias analysis.
