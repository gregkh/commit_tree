mtd: phram: use div_u64_rem to stop overwrite len in phram_setup

We now support user to set erase page size, and use do_div between len
and erase size to determine the reasonableness for the erase size.
However, do_div is a macro and will overwrite the value of len. Which
results a mtd device with unexcepted size. Fix it by use div_u64_rem.
