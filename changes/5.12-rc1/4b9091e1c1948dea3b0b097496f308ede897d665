kernel: trace: preemptirq_delay_test: add cpu affinity

The kernel thread executing test can run on any cpu, which might be
different cpu latency tracer is running on, as a result, the
big latency caused by preemptirq delay test can't be detected.

Therefore, the argument cpu_affinity is added to be passed to test,
ensure it's running on the same cpu with latency tracer.

e.g.
cyclictest -p 90 -m -c 0 -i 1000 -a 3
modprobe preemptirq_delay_test test_mode=preempt delay=500 \
burst_size=3 cpu_affinity=3
