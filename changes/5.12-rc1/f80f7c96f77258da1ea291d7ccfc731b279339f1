dmaengine: dw-axi-dmac: Virtually split the linked-list

AxiDMA driver exposed the dma_set_max_seg_size() to the DMAENGINE.
It shall helps the DMA clients to create size-optimized linked-list
for the controller.

However, there are certain situations where DMA client might not be
abled to benefit from the dma_get_max_seg_size() if the segment size
can't meet the nature of the DMA client's operation.

In the case of ALSA operation, ALSA application and driver expecting
to run in a period of larger than 10ms regardless of the bit depth.
With this large period, there is a strong request to split the linked-list
in the AxiDMA driver.
