watchdog: renesas_wdt: don't sleep in atomic context

In the restart handler, we hit multiple OOPSes. One because of
usleep_range() and one because of RPM. So, instead of re-using
rwdt_start(), we implement an atomic version of it in the restart
handler. As a little bonus, reboot will occur sooner because we can now
use the smallest divider in the custom restart routine.
