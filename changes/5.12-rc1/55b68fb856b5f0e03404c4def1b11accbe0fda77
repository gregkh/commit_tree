drm/omap: squash omapdrm sub-modules into one

At the moment we have three different modules: omapdss-base, omapdss,
omapdrm. This setup is finally obsolete, as the last omapdrm specific
panel has been converted to DRM panel.

We can thus remove omapdss-base and omapdss, and just compile everything
into omapdrm.ko.
