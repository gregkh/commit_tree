MIPS: c-r4k: Fix section mismatch for loongson2_sc_init

When building with clang, the following section mismatch warning occurs:

WARNING: modpost: vmlinux.o(.text+0x24490): Section mismatch in
reference from the function r4k_cache_init() to the function
.init.text:loongson2_sc_init()

This should have been fixed with commit ad4fddef5f23 ("mips: fix Section
mismatch in reference") but it was missed. Remove the improper __init
annotation like that commit did.

Fixes: 078a55fc824c ("MIPS: Delete __cpuinit/__CPUINIT usage from MIPS code")
