kfence: report sensitive information based on no_hash_pointers

We cannot rely on CONFIG_DEBUG_KERNEL to decide if we're running a "debug
kernel" where we can safely show potentially sensitive information in the
kernel log.

Instead, simply rely on the newly introduced "no_hash_pointers" to print
unhashed kernel pointers, as well as decide if our reports can include
other potentially sensitive information such as registers and corrupted
bytes.
