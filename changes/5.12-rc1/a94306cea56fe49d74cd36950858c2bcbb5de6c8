net: mscc: ocelot: better error handling in ocelot_xtr_irq_handler

The ocelot_rx_frame_word() function can return a negative error code,
however this isn't being checked for consistently. Errors being ignored
have not been seen in practice though.

Also, some constructs can be simplified by using "goto" instead of
repeated "break" statements.
