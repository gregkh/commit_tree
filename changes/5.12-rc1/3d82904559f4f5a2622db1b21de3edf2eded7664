usb: cdnsp: cdns3 Add main part of Cadence USBSSP DRD Driver

This patch introduces the main part of Cadence USBSSP DRD driver
to Linux kernel.
To reduce the patch size a little bit, the header file gadget.h was
intentionally added as separate patch.

The Cadence USBSSP DRD Controller is a highly configurable IP Core which
can be instantiated as Dual-Role Device (DRD), Peripheral Only and
Host Only (XHCI)configurations.

The current driver has been validated with FPGA platform. We have
support for PCIe bus, which is used on FPGA prototyping.

The host side of USBSS DRD controller is compliant with XHCI.
The architecture for device side is almost the same as for host side,
and most of the XHCI specification can be used to understand how
this controller operates.
