x86/apic: Export x2apic_mode for use by KVM in "warm" path

Export x2apic_mode so that KVM can query whether x2APIC is active
without having to incur the RDMSR in x2apic_enabled().  When Posted
Interrupts are in use for a guest with an assigned device, KVM ends up
checking for x2APIC at least once every time a vCPU halts.  KVM could
obviously snapshot x2apic_enabled() to avoid the RDMSR, but that's
rather silly given that x2apic_mode holds the exact info needed by KVM.
