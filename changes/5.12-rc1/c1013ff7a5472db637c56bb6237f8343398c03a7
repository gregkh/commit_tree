ACPI: scan: Rearrange memory allocation in acpi_device_add()

The upfront allocation of new_bus_id is done to avoid allocating
memory under acpi_device_lock, but it doesn't really help,
because (1) it leads to many unnecessary memory allocations for
_ADR devices, (2) kstrdup_const() is run under that lock anyway and
(3) it complicates the code.

Rearrange acpi_device_add() to allocate memory for a new struct
acpi_device_bus_id instance only when necessary, eliminate a redundant
local variable from it and reduce the number of labels in there.

No intentional functional impact.
