arm64: mm: Implement arch_wants_old_prefaulted_pte()

On CPUs with hardware AF/DBM, initialising prefaulted PTEs as 'old'
improves vmscan behaviour and does not appear to introduce any overhead
elsewhere.

Implement arch_wants_old_prefaulted_pte() to return 'true' if we detect
hardware access flag support at runtime. This can be extended in future
based on MIDR matching if necessary.
