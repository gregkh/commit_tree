mm: memcontrol: replace the loop with a list_for_each_entry()

The rule of list walk has gone since commit a9d5adeeb4b2
("mm/memcontrol: allow to uncharge page without using page->lru field")

So remove the strange comment and replace the loop with a
list_for_each_entry().

There is only one caller of the uncharge_list().  So just fold it into
mem_cgroup_uncharge_list() and remove it.
