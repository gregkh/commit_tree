tracing: Do not create "enable" or "filter" files for ftrace event subsystem

The ftrace event subsystem is only created for showing the format files of
events created by the ftrace tracers, and are not trace events. The ftrace
subsystem currently has both the "enable" and "filter" files that in other
subsystems are used to enable/disable all events within the subsystem or set
a filter for all the subsystem events.

As ftrace subsystem events do not use enable or filter operations, these
files are useless in the ftrace subsystem. Remove them.
