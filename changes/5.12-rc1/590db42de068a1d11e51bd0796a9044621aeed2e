perf report: Support instruction latency

The instruction latency information can be recorded on some platforms,
e.g., the Intel Sapphire Rapids server. With both memory latency
(weight) and the new instruction latency information, users can easily
locate the expensive load instructions, and also understand the time
spent in different stages. The users can optimize their applications in
different pipeline stages.

The 'weight' field is shared among different architectures. Reusing the
'weight' field may impacts other architectures. Add a new field to store
the instruction latency.

Like the 'weight' support, introduce a 'ins_lat' for the global
instruction latency, and a 'local_ins_lat' for the local instruction
latency version.

Add new sort functions, INSTR Latency and Local INSTR Latency,
accordingly.

Add local_ins_lat to the default_mem_sort_order[].
