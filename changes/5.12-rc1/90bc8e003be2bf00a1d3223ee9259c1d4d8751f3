i40e: Add hardware configuration for software based DCB

Add registers and definitions required for applying
DCB related hardware configuration.

Add functions responsible for calculating and setting proper
hardware configuration values for software based DCB functionality.

Add function responsible for invoking Admin Queue command, which
results in applying new DCB configuration to the hardware.

Update copyright dates as appropriate.

Software based DCB is a brand-new feature in i40e driver.
Before, DCB was implemented by Firmware LLDP agent only. The agent was
responsible for handling incoming DCB-related LLDP frames and
applying received DCB configuration to hardware.

New communication channel between software and hardware is required
for software driver. It must be able to calculate and configure all
the registers related for DCB feature.
