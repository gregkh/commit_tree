drm/i915: fix size_t greater or equal to zero comparison

Currently the check that the unsigned size_t variable i is >= 0
is always true because the unsigned variable will never be negative,
causing the loop to run forever.  Fix this by changing the
pre-decrement check to a zero check on i followed by a decrement of i.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Unsigned compared against 0")
