powerpc/pseries: Delete an unnecessary kfree() call in dlpar_store()

A null pointer would be passed to a call of the function “kfree”
immediately after a call of the function “kstrdup” failed at one place.
Remove this superfluous function call.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
