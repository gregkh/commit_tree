tools/memory-model: Remove redundant initialization in litmus tests

This is a revert of commit 1947bfcf81a9 ("tools/memory-model: Add types
to litmus tests") with conflict resolutions.

klitmus7 [1] is aware of default types of "int" and "int*".
It accepts litmus tests for herd7 without extra type info unless
non-"int" variables are referenced by an "exists", "locations",
or "filter" directive.

[1]: Tested with klitmus7 versions 7.49 or later.
