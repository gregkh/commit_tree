io_uring/io-wq: return 2-step work swap scheme

Saving one lock/unlock for io-wq is not super important, but adds some
ugliness in the code. More important, atomic decs not turning it to zero
for some archs won't give the right ordering/barriers so the
io_steal_work() may pretty easily get subtly and completely broken.

Return back 2-step io-wq work exchange and clean it up.
