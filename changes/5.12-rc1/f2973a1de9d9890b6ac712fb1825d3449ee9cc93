ASoC: es8316: Fix possible NULL pointer deref in es8316_disable_jack_detect()

sound/soc/soc-core.c: soc_remove_component() unconditionally calls
snd_soc_component_set_jack(component, NULL, NULL); on any components
being removed.

This means that on machines where the machine-driver does not provide
a jack through snd_soc_component_set_jack() es8316_disable_jack_detect()
will still get called and at this time es8316->jack will be NULL and
the es8316->jack->status check in es8316_disable_jack_detect() will
lead to a NULL pointer deref.

Fix this by checking for es8316->jack bein NULL at the start of
es8316_disable_jack_detect() and turn the function into a no-op in
that case.
