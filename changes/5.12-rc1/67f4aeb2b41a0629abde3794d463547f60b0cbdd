drm/sun4i: tcon: fix inverted DCLK polarity

During commit 88bc4178568b ("drm: Use new
DRM_BUS_FLAG_*_(DRIVE|SAMPLE)_(POS|NEG)EDGE flags") DRM_BUS_FLAG_*
macros have been changed to avoid ambiguity but just because of this
ambiguity previous DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_(POS/NEG)EDGE were used meaning
_SAMPLE_ not _DRIVE_. This leads to DLCK inversion and need to fix but
instead of swapping phase values, let's adopt an easier approach Maxime
suggested:
It turned out that bit 26 of SUN4I_TCON0_IO_POL_REG is dedicated to
invert DCLK polarity and this makes things really easier than before. So
let's handle DCLK polarity by adding SUN4I_TCON0_IO_POL_DCLK_DRIVE_NEGEDGE
as bit 26 and activating according to bus_flags the same way it is done
for all the other signals polarity.
