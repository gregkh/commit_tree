ARM: 9042/1: debug: no uncompress debugging while semihosting

The build robots have discovered that uncompress debugging
and semihosting does not play well together.

This is due to many factors but in general semihosting
debug needs to be rewritten to work the same way as any
LL_DEBUG, e.g. with a header in
arch/arm/include/debug/semihosting.S
This is a long term solution and needs testing on real
hardware and/or software models using semihosting.

For now disable uncompress debugging under semihosting.
