io_uring: clean iov usage for recvmsg buf select

Don't pretend we don't know that REQ_F_BUFFER_SELECT for recvmsg always
uses fast_iov -- clean up confusing intermixing kmsg->iov and
kmsg->fast_iov for buffer select.

Also don't init iter with garbage in __io_recvmsg_copy_hdr() only for it
to be set shortly after in io_recvmsg().
