RDMA/rxe: Make pool lookup and alloc APIs type safe

The allocate, lookup index, lookup key and cleanup routines in rxe_pool.c
currently are not type safe against relocating the pelem field in the
objects. Planned changes to move allocation of objects into rdma-core make
addressing this a requirement.

Use the elem_offset field in rxe_type_info make these APIs safe against
moving the pelem field.
