bpf: Drop MTU check when doing TC-BPF redirect to ingress

The use-case for dropping the MTU check when TC-BPF does redirect to
ingress, is described by Eyal Birger in email[0]. The summary is the
ability to increase packet size (e.g. with IPv6 headers for NAT64) and
ingress redirect packet and let normal netstack fragment packet as needed.

V15:
 - missing static for function declaration

V9:
 - Make net_device "up" (IFF_UP) check explicit in skb_do_redirect

V4:
 - Keep net_device "up" (IFF_UP) check.
 - Adjustment to handle bpf_redirect_peer() helper
