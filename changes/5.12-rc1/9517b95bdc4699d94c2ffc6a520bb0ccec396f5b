Input: elants_i2c - add support for eKTF3624

Add ELAN KTF3624 touchscreen support to the elants_i2c driver.
The eKTF3624 TS is found on a series of ASUS Transformer tablet devices,
Nexus 7 tablet and etc. The firmware interface of eKTF3624 is nearly
identical to eKTH3500, which is already supported by the driver.
The minor differences of the firmware interface are now handled by
the driver. The eKTF3624 support was tested on ASUS Transformer TF700T,
TF300T and Nexus 7 tablets.
