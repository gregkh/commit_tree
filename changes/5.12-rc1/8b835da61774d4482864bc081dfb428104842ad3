spi: stm32: update dev_dbg() print format for SPI params

With the introduction of the 'include/uapi/linux/spi/spi.h' header, the
type of the macros are enforced to 'unsigned long int' via the _BITUL()
macro.

This causes some -Wformat warnings in the spi-stm32 driver.
This patch adds a double-negation operator to the bit-masks. Essentially,
the important values for debugging are 0 or 1, while masking them directly
would show 0 or BIT(x) values.
This way, the type of the arguments are automatically re-cast.
