btrfs: zoned: allow zoned filesystems on non-zoned block devices

Run a zoned filesystem on non-zoned devices. This is done by "slicing up"
the block device into static sized chunks and fake a conventional zone on
each of them. The emulated zone size is determined from the size of device
extent.

This is mainly aimed at testing of zoned filesystems, i.e. the zoned
chunk allocator, on regular block devices.
