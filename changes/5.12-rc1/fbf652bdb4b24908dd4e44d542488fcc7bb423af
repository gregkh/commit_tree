drm/i915/hdcp: Move HDCP enc status timeout to header

DP MST stream encryption status requires time of a link frame
in order to change its status, but as there were some HDCP
encryption timeout observed earlier, it is safer to use
ENCRYPT_STATUS_CHANGE_TIMEOUT_MS timeout for stream status too,
it requires to move the macro to a header.
It will be used by both HDCP{1.x,2.x} stream status timeout.
