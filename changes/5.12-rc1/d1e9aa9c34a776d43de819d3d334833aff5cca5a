virtio-blk: support per-device queue depth

module parameter 'virtblk_queue_depth' was firstly introduced for
testing/benchmarking purposes described in commit fc4324b4597c
("virtio-blk: base queue-depth on virtqueue ringsize or module param").
And currently 'virtblk_queue_depth' is used as a saved value for the
first probed device.
Since we have different virtio-blk devices which have different
capabilities, it requires that we support per-device queue depth instead
of per-module. So defaultly use vq free elements if module parameter
'virtblk_queue_depth' is not set.
