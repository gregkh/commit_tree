KVM: nSVM: fix running nested guests when npt=0

In case of npt=0 on host, nSVM needs the same .inject_page_fault tweak
as VMX has, to make sure that shadow mmu faults are injected as vmexits.

It is not clear why this is needed at all, but for now keep the same
code as VMX and we'll fix it for both.

Based on a patch by Maxim Levitsky <mlevitsk@redhat.com>.
