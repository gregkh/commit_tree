mm: add __clear_page_lru_flags() to replace page_off_lru()

Similar to page_off_lru(), the new function does non-atomic clearing
of PageLRU() in addition to PageActive() and PageUnevictable(), on a
page that has no references left.

If PageActive() and PageUnevictable() are both set, refuse to clear
either and leave them to bad_page(). This is a behavior change that
is meant to help debug.
