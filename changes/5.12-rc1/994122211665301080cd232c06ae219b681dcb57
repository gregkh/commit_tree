remoteproc: qcom: expose types for COMPILE_TEST

Stub functions are defined for SSR notifier registration in case
QCOM_RPROC_COMMON is not configured.  As a result, code that uses
these functions can link successfully even if the common remoteproc
code is not built.

Code that registers an SSR notifier function likely needs the
types defined in "qcom_rproc.h", but those are only exposed if
QCOM_RPROC_COMMON is enabled.

Rearrange the conditional definition so the qcom_ssr_notify_data
structure and qcom_ssr_notify_type enumerated type are defined
whether or not QCOM_RPROC_COMMON is enabled.
