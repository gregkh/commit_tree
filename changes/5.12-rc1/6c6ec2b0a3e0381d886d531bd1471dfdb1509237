fs: add support for LOOKUP_CACHED

io_uring always punts opens to async context, since there's no control
over whether the lookup blocks or not. Add LOOKUP_CACHED to support
just doing the fast RCU based lookups, which we know will not block. If
we can do a cached path resolution of the filename, then we don't have
to always punt lookups for a worker.

During path resolution, we always do LOOKUP_RCU first. If that fails and
we terminate LOOKUP_RCU, then fail a LOOKUP_CACHED attempt as well.
