drm/omap: dsi: request VC via mipi_dsi_attach

Drop custom request_vc/release_vc callbacks by using the
generic mipi_dsi_attach/mipi_dsi_detach functions.

To use mipi_dsi_attach() we need to fill in the mipi_dsi_device fields,
and some of these fields overlap with the fields in omap_dss_dsi_config.
In later patches the latter will get dropped.
