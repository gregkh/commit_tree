net: dsa: propagate extack to .port_vlan_add

Allow drivers to communicate their restrictions to user space directly,
instead of printing to the kernel log. Where the conversion would have
been lossy and things like VLAN ID could no longer be conveyed (due to
the lack of support for printf format specifier in netlink extack), I
chose to keep the messages in full form to the kernel log only, and
leave it up to individual driver maintainers to move more messages to
extack.
