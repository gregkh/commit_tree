powerpc/32s: Add missing call to kuep_lock on syscall entry

Userspace Execution protection and fast syscall entry were implemented
independently from each other and were both merged in kernel 5.2,
leading to syscall entry missing userspace execution protection.

On syscall entry, execution of user space memory must be
locked in the same way as on exception entry.
