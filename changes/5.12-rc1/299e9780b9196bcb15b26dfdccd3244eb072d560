soundwire: bus: use sdw_write_no_pm when setting the bus scale registers

When a Slave device is resumed, it may resume the bus and restart the
enumeration. During that process, we absolutely don't want to call
regular read/write routines which will wait for the resume to
complete, otherwise a deadlock occurs.

This patch fixes the same problem as the previous one, but is split to
make the life of linux-stable maintainers less painful.
