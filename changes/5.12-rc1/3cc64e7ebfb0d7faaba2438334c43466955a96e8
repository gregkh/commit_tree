btrfs: clarify error returns values in __load_free_space_cache

Return value in __load_free_space_cache is not properly set after
(unlikely) memory allocation failures and 0 is returned instead.
This is not a problem for the caller load_free_space_cache because only
value 1 is considered as 'cache loaded' but for clarity it's better
to set the errors accordingly.

Fixes: a67509c30079 ("Btrfs: add a io_ctl struct and helpers for dealing with the space cache")
