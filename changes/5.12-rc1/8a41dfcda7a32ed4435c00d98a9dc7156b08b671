sched/fair: Don't set LBF_ALL_PINNED unnecessarily

Setting LBF_ALL_PINNED during active load balance is only valid when there
is only 1 running task on the rq otherwise this ends up increasing the
balance interval whereas other tasks could migrate after the next interval
once they become cache-cold as an example.

LBF_ALL_PINNED flag is now always set it by default. It is then cleared
when we find one task that can be pulled when calling detach_tasks() or
during active migration.
