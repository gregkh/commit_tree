powerpc/83xx: Fix build error when CONFIG_PCI=n

As reported by lkp:

  arch/powerpc/platforms/83xx/km83xx.c:183:19: error: 'mpc83xx_setup_pci' undeclared here (not in a function)
     183 |  .discover_phbs = mpc83xx_setup_pci,
	 |                   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	 |                   mpc83xx_setup_arch

There is a stub defined for the CONFIG_PCI=n case, but now that
mpc83xx_setup_pci() is being assigned to discover_phbs the correct
empty value is NULL.
