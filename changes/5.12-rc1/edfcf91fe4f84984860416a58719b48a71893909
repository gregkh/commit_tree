riscv: Fixup compile error BUILD_BUG_ON failed

Unfortunately, the current code couldn't be compiled:

  CC      arch/riscv/kernel/patch.o

In function ‘fix_to_virt’,
    inlined from ‘patch_map’ at arch/riscv/kernel/patch.c:37:17:

Because fix_to_virt(, idx) needs a const value, not a dynamic variable of
reg-a0 or BUILD_BUG_ON failed with "idx >= __end_of_fixed_addresses".
