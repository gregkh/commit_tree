clk: qcom: mmcc-msm8998: Add hardware clockgating registers to some clks

Hardware clock gating is supported on some of the clocks declared in
there: ignoring that it does exist may lead to unstabilities on some
firmwares.
Add the HWCG registers where applicable to stop potential crashes.

This was verified on a smartphone shipped with a recent MSM8998
firmware, which will experience random crashes without this change.
