net: bonding: Notify ports about their initial state

When creating a static bond (e.g. balance-xor), all ports will always
be enabled. This is set, and the corresponding notification is sent
out, before the port is linked to the bond upper.

In the offloaded case, this ordering is hard to deal with.

The lower will first see a notification that it can not associate with
any bond. Then the bond is joined. After that point no more
notifications are sent, so all ports remain disabled.

This change simply sends an extra notification once the port has been
linked to the upper to synchronize the initial state.
