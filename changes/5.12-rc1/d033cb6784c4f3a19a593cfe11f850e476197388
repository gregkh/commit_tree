mount: make {lock,unlock}_mount_hash() static

The lock_mount_hash() and unlock_mount_hash() helpers are never called
outside a single file. Remove them from the header and make them static
to reflect this fact. There's no need to have them callable from other
places right now, as Christoph observed.
