numa: Move numa implementation to common code

ARM64 numa implementation is generic enough that RISC-V can reuse that
implementation with very minor cosmetic changes. This will help both
ARM64 and RISC-V in terms of maintanace and feature improvement

Move the numa implementation code to common directory so that both ISAs
can reuse this. This doesn't introduce any function changes for ARM64.
