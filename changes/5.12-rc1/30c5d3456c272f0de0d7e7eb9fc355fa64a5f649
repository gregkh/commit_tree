block: do not reassig ->bi_bdev when partition remapping

There is no good reason to reassign ->bi_bdev when remapping the
partition-relative block number to the device wide one, as all the
information required by the drivers comes from the gendisk anyway.

Keeping the original ->bi_bdev alive will allow to greatly simplify
the partition-away I/O accounting.
