s390: fix kernel asce loading when sie is interrupted

If a machine check is coming in during sie, the PU saves the
control registers to the machine check save area. Afterwards
mcck_int_handler is called, which loads __LC_KERNEL_ASCE into
%cr1. Later the code restores %cr1 from the machine check area,
but that is wrong when SIE was interrupted because the machine
check area still contains the gmap asce. Instead it should return
with either __KERNEL_ASCE in %cr1 when interrupted in SIE or
the previous %cr1 content saved in the machine check save area.
