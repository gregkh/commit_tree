soc: ti: knav_qmss: Put refcount for dev node in failure case

for_each_child_of_node increases refcount for each device_node and decreases previous one
in a loop, but in case jump out of a loop current node refcount has no chnase for decreases
so requires an of_node_put for jupm out cases.

Fix based on raport from
scripts/coccinelle/iterators/for_each_child.cocci
