zonefs: use zone write granularity as block size

Zoned block devices have different granularity constraints for write
operations into sequential zones. E.g. ZBC and ZAC devices require that
writes be aligned to the device physical block size while NVMe ZNS
devices allow logical block size aligned write operations. To correctly
handle such difference, use the device zone write granularity limit to
set the block size of a zonefs volume, thus allowing the smallest
possible write unit for all zoned device types.
