checkpatch: improve blank line after declaration test

Avoid multiple false positives by ignoring attributes.

Various attributes like volatile and ____cacheline_aligned_in_smp cause
checkpatch to emit invalid "Missing a blank line after declarations"
messages.

Use copies of $sline and $prevline, remove $Attribute and $Sparse, and use
the existing tests to avoid these false positives.

Miscellanea:

o Add volatile to $Attribute

This also reduces checkpatch runtime a bit by moving the indentation
comparison test to the start of the block to avoid multiple unnecessary
regex tests.
