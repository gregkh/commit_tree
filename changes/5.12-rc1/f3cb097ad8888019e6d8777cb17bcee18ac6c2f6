arm64: Support running gen_vdso_offsets.sh with BSD userland.

BSD sed ignores whitespace character escape sequences such as '\t' in
the replacement string, causing this script to produce the following
incorrect output:

Â  #define vdso_offset_sigtrampt0x089c

Changing the hard tab to ' ' causes both BSD and GNU dialects of sed
to produce equivalent output.
