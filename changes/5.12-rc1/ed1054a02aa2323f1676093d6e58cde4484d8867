irqdomain: Mark fwnodes when their irqdomain is added/removed

This allows fw_devlink to recognize irqdomain drivers that don't use the
device-driver model to initialize the device. fw_devlink will use this
information to make sure consumers of such irqdomain aren't indefinitely
blocked from probing, waiting for the irqdomain device to appear and
bind to a driver.
