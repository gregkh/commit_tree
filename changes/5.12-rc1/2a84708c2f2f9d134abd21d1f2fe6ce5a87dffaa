dt-bindings: gpio: rcar: Add r8a779a0 support

Document the compatible value for the GPIO block in the Renesas R-Car
V3U (R8A779A0) SoC.

While this GPIO block is mostly compatible with GPIO blocks on R-Car
Gen3 SoCs, there are small differences, and one of the new registers
needs to be configured differently from its initial reset state.
