efi: x86: clean up previous struct mm switching

EFI on x86_64 keeps track of the process's MM pointer by storing it
in a global struct called 'efi_scratch', which also used to contain
the mixed mode stack pointer. Let's clean this up a little bit, by
getting rid of the struct, and pushing the mm handling into the
callees entirely.
