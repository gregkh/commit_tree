MIPS: vmlinux.lds.S: explicitly declare .got table

LLVM stack generates GOT table when building the kernel:

ld.lld: warning: <internal>:(.got) is being placed in '.got'

According to the debug assertions, it's not zero-sized and thus can't
be handled the way it's done for x86.
Also use the ARM64 path here and place it at the end of .text section.
