ASoC: qcom: lpass-cpu: Remove bit clock state check

No need of BCLK state maintenance from driver side as
clock_enable and clk_disable API's maintaing state counter.

One of the major issue was spotted when Headset jack inserted
while playback continues, due to same PCM device node opens twice
for playaback/capture and closes once for capture and playback continues.

It can resolve the errors in such scenarios.
