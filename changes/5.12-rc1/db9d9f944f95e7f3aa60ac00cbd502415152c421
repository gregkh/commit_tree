soundwire: cadence: fix ACK/NAK handling

The existing code reports a NAK only when ACK=0
This is not aligned with the SoundWire 1.x specifications.

Table 32 in the SoundWire 1.2 specification shows that a Device shall
not set NAK=1 if ACK=1. But Table 33 shows the Combined Response
may very well be NAK=1/ACK=1, e.g. if another Device than the one
addressed reports a parity error.

NAK=1 signals a 'Command_Aborted', regardless of the ACK bit value.

Move the tests for NAK so that the NAK=1/ACK=1 combination is properly
detected according to the specification.
