KVM: x86/mmu: Rename goal_gfn to next_last_level_gfn

The goal_gfn field in tdp_iter can be misleading as it implies that it
is the iterator's final goal. It is really a target for the lowest gfn
mapped by the leaf level SPTE the iterator will traverse towards. Change
the field's name to be more precise.
