KVM: x86: Restore all 64 bits of DR6 and DR7 during RSM on x86-64

Restore the full 64-bit values of DR6 and DR7 when emulating RSM on
x86-64, as defined by both Intel's SDM and AMD's APM.

Note, bits 63:32 of DR6 and DR7 are reserved, so this is a glorified nop
unless the SMM handler is poking into SMRAM, which it most definitely
shouldn't be doing since both Intel and AMD list the DR6 and DR7 fields
as read-only.
