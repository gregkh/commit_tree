drm/i915: Reject 446-480MHz HDMI clock on GLK

The BXT/GLK DPLL can't generate certain frequencies. We already
reject the 233-240MHz range on both. But on GLK the DPLL max
frequency was bumped from 300MHz to 594MHz, so now we get to
also worry about the 446-480MHz range (double the original
problem range). Reject any frequency within the higher
problematic range as well.
