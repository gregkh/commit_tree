net: hsr: add offloading support

Add support for offloading of HSR/PRP (IEC 62439-3) tag insertion
tag removal, duplicate generation and forwarding.

For HSR, insertion involves the switch adding a 6 byte HSR header after
the 14 byte Ethernet header. For PRP it adds a 6 byte trailer.

Tag removal involves automatically stripping the HSR/PRP header/trailer
in the switch. This is possible when the switch also performs auto
deduplication using the HSR/PRP header/trailer (making it no longer
required).

Forwarding involves automatically forwarding between redundant ports in
an HSR. This is crucial because delay is accumulated as a frame passes
through each node in the ring.

Duplication involves the switch automatically sending a single frame
from the CPU port to both redundant ports. This is required because the
inserted HSR/PRP header/trailer must contain the same sequence number
on the frames sent out both redundant ports.

Export is_hsr_master so DSA can tell them apart from other devices in
dsa_slave_changeupper.
