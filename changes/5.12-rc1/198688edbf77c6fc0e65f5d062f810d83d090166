MIPS: Fix inline asm input/output type mismatch in checksum.h used with Clang

Fix the following build error when make M=samples/bpf used with Clang:

  CLANG-bpf  samples/bpf/sockex2_kern.o
In file included from samples/bpf/sockex2_kern.c:7:
In file included from ./include/uapi/linux/if_tunnel.h:7:
In file included from ./include/linux/ip.h:16:
In file included from ./include/linux/skbuff.h:28:
In file included from ./include/net/checksum.h:22:
./arch/mips/include/asm/checksum.h:161:9: error: unsupported inline asm: input with type 'unsigned long' matching output with type '__wsum' (aka 'unsigned int')
        : "0" ((__force unsigned long)daddr),
               ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 error generated.

This is a known issue on MIPS [1], the changed code can be compiled
successfully by both GCC and Clang.
