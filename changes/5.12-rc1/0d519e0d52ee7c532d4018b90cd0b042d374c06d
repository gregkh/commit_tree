dax-device: Make remove callback return void

The driver core ignores the return value of struct bus_type::remove()
because there is only little that can be done. To simplify the quest to
make this function return void, let struct dax_device_driver::remove()
return void, too. All users already unconditionally return 0, this commit
makes it obvious that returning an error code isn't intended.
