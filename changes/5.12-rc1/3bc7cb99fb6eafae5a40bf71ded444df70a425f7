regulator: qcom-labibb: Implement pull-down, softstart, active discharge

Soft start is required to avoid inrush current during LAB ramp-up and
IBB ramp-down, protecting connected hardware to which we supply voltage.

Since soft start is configurable on both LAB and IBB regulators, it
was necessary to add two DT properties, respectively "qcom,soft-start-us"
to control LAB ramp-up and "qcom,discharge-resistor-kohms" to control
the discharge resistor for IBB ramp-down, which obviously brought the
need of implementing a of_parse callback for both regulators.

Finally, also implement pull-down mode in order to avoid unpredictable
behavior when the regulators are disabled (random voltage spikes etc).
