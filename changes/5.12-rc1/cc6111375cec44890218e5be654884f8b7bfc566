ARM: drop efm32 platform

I didn't touch this code since it served as a platform to introduce
ARMv7-M support to Linux. The only known machine that runs Linux has only
4 MiB of RAM (that originally only exists to hold the display's framebuffer).

There are no known users and no further use foreseeable, so drop the
code.
