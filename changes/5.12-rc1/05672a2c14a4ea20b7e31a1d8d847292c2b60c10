Bluetooth: btrtl: Enable central-peripheral role

Enable the central-peripheral role on RTL8822CE. This enables creating
connections while there is an existing connection in the slave role.

This change can be confirmed in userspace via `bluetoothctl show` which
will now show "Roles: central-peripheral".
