ext4: simplify i_state checks in __ext4_update_other_inode_time()

Since I_DIRTY_TIME and I_DIRTY_INODE are mutually exclusive in i_state,
there's no need to check for I_DIRTY_TIME && !I_DIRTY_INODE.  Just check
for I_DIRTY_TIME.

Also introduce a helper function in include/linux/fs.h to do this check.
