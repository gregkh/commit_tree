ASoC: rt5645: Introduce mapping for ACPI-defined GPIO

On at least one laptop (ECS EF20EA) the 'hp-detect' GPIO is defined in
the DSDT table by the ACPI GpioIo resources in _CRS. The GPIO related
information should be mapped to the rt5645 driver to enable the jack
detection also on non-DT platforms.
