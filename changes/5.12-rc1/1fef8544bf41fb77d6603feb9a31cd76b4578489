sctp: remove the NETIF_F_SG flag before calling skb_segment

It makes more sense to clear NETIF_F_SG instead of set it when
calling skb_segment() in sctp_gso_segment(), since SCTP GSO is
using head_skb's fraglist, of which all frags are linear skbs.

This will make SCTP GSO code more understandable.
