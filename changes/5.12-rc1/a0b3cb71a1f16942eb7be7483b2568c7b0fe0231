isofs: handle large user and group ID

If uid or gid of mount options is larger than INT_MAX, isofs_fill_super
will return -EINVAL.

The problem can be encountered by a domain user or reproduced via:
mount -o loop,uid=2147483648 ubuntu-16.04.6-server-amd64.iso /mnt

This can be fixed as commit 233a01fa9c4c ("fuse: handle large user and
group ID").
