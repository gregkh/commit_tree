RDMA/uverbs: Don't set rcq for a QP if qp_type is IB_QPT_XRC_INI

An INI QP doesn't require receive CQ, the creation flow sets the recv counts
to zero:

		if (cmd->qp_type == IB_QPT_XRC_INI) {
			cmd->max_recv_wr = 0;
			cmd->max_recv_sge = 0;

The new IOCTL path also does not set the rcq, so make things the same.
