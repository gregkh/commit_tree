rcu/trace: Add tracing for how segcb list changes

This commit adds tracing to track how the segcb list changes before/after
acceleration, during queuing and during dequeuing.

This tracing helped discover an optimization that avoided needless GP
requests when no callbacks were accelerated. The tracing overhead is
minimal as each segment's length is now stored in the respective segment.
