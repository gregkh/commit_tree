staging: qlge: clean up debugging code in the QL_ALL_DUMP ifdef land

The debugging code in the following ifdef land
 - QL_ALL_DUMP
 - QL_REG_DUMP
 - QL_DEV_DUMP
 - QL_CB_DUMP
 - QL_IB_DUMP
 - QL_OB_DUMP

becomes unnecessary because,
 - Device status and general registers can be obtained by ethtool.
 - Coredump can be done via devlink health reporter.
 - Structure related to the hardware (struct ql_adapter) can be obtained
   by crash or drgn.
