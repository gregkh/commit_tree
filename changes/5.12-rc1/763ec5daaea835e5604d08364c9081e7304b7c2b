cpufreq: tegra20: Use resource-managed API

Switch cpufreq-tegra20 driver to use resource-managed API.
This removes the need to get opp_table pointer using
dev_pm_opp_get_opp_table() in order to release OPP table that
was requested by dev_pm_opp_set_supported_hw(), making the code
a bit more straightforward.
