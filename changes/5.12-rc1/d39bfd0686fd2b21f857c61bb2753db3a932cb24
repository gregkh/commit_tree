scsi: iscsi: Drop session lock in iscsi_session_chkready()

The session lock in iscsi_session_chkready() is not needed because when we
transition from logged into to another state we will block and/or remove
the devices under the session, so no new I/O will be sent to the drivers
after the block/remove. I/O that races with the block/removal is cleaned up
by the drivers when it handles all outstanding I/O, so this just added an
extra lock in the main I/O path. This patch removes the lock like other
transport classes.
