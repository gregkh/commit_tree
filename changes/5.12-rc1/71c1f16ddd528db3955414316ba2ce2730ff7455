media: ti-vpe: cal: Iterate over correct number of CAMERARX instances

When performing operations on all CAMERARX instances, code usually
iterates over all cal->phy[] entries and skips the NULL pointers. The
number of available CAMERARX instances is however available through
cal->data->num_csi2_phy. Use it instead.
