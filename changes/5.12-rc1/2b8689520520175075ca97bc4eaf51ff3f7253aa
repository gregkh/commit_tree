kbuild: prevent CC_FLAGS_LTO self-bloating on recursive rebuilds

CC_FLAGS_LTO gets initialized only via +=, never with := or =.
When building with CONFIG_TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS, Kbuild may perform
several kernel rebuilds to satisfy symbol dependencies. In this
case, value of CC_FLAGS_LTO is concatenated each time, which
triggers a full rebuild.
Initialize it with := to fix this.
