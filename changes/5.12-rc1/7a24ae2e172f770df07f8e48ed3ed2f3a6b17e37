powerpc/32s: move DABR match out of handle_page_fault

handle_page_fault() has some code dedicated to book3s/32 to
call do_break() when the DSI is a DABR match.

On other platforms, do_break() is handled separately.

Do the same for book3s/32, do it earlier in the process of DSI.

This change also avoid doing the test on ISI.
