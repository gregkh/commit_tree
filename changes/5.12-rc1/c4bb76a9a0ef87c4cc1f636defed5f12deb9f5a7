net: dsa: don't use switchdev_notifier_fdb_info in dsa_switchdev_event_work

Currently DSA doesn't add FDB entries on the CPU port, because it only
does so through switchdev, which is associated with a net_device, and
there are none of those for the CPU port.

But actually FDB addresses on the CPU port have some use cases of their
own, if the switchdev operations are initiated from within the DSA
layer. There is just one problem with the existing code: it passes a
structure in dsa_switchdev_event_work which was retrieved directly from
switchdev, so it contains a net_device. We need to generalize the
contents to something that covers the CPU port as well: the "ds, port"
tuple is fine for that.

Note that the new procedure for notifying the successful FDB offload is
inspired from the rocker model.

Also, nothing was being done if added_by_user was false. Let's check for
that a lot earlier, and don't actually bother to schedule the worker
for nothing.
