misc: eeprom_93xx46: Add quirk to support Microchip 93LC46B eeprom

A dummy zero bit is sent preceding the data during a read transfer by the
Microchip 93LC46B eeprom (section 2.7 of[1]). This results in right shift
of data during a read. In order to ignore this bit a quirk can be added to
send an extra zero bit after the read address.

Add a quirk to ignore the zero bit sent before data by adding a zero bit
after the read address.
