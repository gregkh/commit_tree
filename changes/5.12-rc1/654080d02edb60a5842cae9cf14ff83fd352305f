scsi: ibmvfc: Relax locking around ibmvfc_queuecommand()

The driver's queuecommand routine is still wrapped to hold the host lock
for the duration of the call. This will become problematic when moving to
multiple queues due to the lock contention preventing asynchronous
submissions to mulitple queues. There is no real legitimate reason to hold
the host lock, and previous patches have insured proper protection of
moving ibmvfc_event objects between free and sent lists.
