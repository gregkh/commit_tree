usb: dwc2: enable FS/LS PHY clock select on STM32MP15 FS OTG

When the core is in FS host mode, using the FS transceiver, and a Low-Speed
device is connected, transceiver clock is 6Mhz.
So, to support Low-Speed devices, enable support of FS/LS Low Power mode,
so that the PHY supplies a 6 MHz clock during Low-Speed mode.
