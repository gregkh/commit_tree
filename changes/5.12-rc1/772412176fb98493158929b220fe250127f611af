bpf: Allow rewriting to ports under ip_unprivileged_port_start

At the moment, BPF_CGROUP_INET{4,6}_BIND hooks can rewrite user_port
to the privileged ones (< ip_unprivileged_port_start), but it will
be rejected later on in the __inet_bind or __inet6_bind.

Let's add another return value to indicate that CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
check should be ignored. Use the same idea as we currently use
in cgroup/egress where bit #1 indicates CN. Instead, for
cgroup/bind{4,6}, bit #1 indicates that CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE should
be bypassed.

v5:
- rename flags to be less confusing (Andrey Ignatov)
- rework BPF_PROG_CGROUP_INET_EGRESS_RUN_ARRAY to work on flags
  and accept BPF_RET_SET_CN (no behavioral changes)

v4:
- Add missing IPv6 support (Martin KaFai Lau)

v3:
- Update description (Martin KaFai Lau)
- Fix capability restore in selftest (Martin KaFai Lau)

v2:
- Switch to explicit return code (Martin KaFai Lau)
