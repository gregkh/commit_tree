ubsan: remove overflow checks

Since GCC 8.0 -fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow doesn't work with
-fwrapv.  -fwrapv makes signed overflows defines and GCC essentially
disables ubsan checks.  On GCC < 8.0 -fwrapv doesn't have influence on
-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow setting, so it kinda works but
generates false-positves and violates uaccess rules:

lib/iov_iter.o: warning: objtool: iovec_from_user()+0x22d: call to
__ubsan_handle_add_overflow() with UACCESS enabled

Disable signed overflow checks to avoid these problems.  Remove unsigned
overflow checks as well.  Unsigned overflow appeared as side effect of
commit cdf8a76fda4a ("ubsan: move cc-option tests into Kconfig"), but it
never worked (kernel doesn't boot).  And unsigned overflows are allowed by
C standard, so it just pointless.
