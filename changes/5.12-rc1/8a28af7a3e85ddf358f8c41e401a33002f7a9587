net: ethernet: aquantia: Handle error cleanup of start on open

The aq_nic_start function can fail in a variety of cases which leaves
the device in broken state.

An example case where the start function fails is the
request_threaded_irq which can be interrupted, resulting in a EINTR
result. This can be manually triggered by bringing the link up (e.g. ip
link set up) and triggering a SIGINT on the initiating process (e.g.
Ctrl+C). This would put the device into a half configured state.
Subsequently bringing the link up again would cause the napi_enable to
BUG.

In order to correctly clean up the failed attempt to start a device call
aq_nic_stop.
