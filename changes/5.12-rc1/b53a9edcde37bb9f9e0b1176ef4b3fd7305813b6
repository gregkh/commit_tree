ARM: 9053/1: arm/mm/ptdump:Add address markers for KASAN regions

ARM has recently supported KASAN, so I think that it's time to add
KASAN regions for PTDUMP on ARM.

This patch has been tested with QEMU + vexpress-a15. Both
CONFIG_ARM_LPAE and no CONFIG_ARM_LPAE.

The result after patching looks like this:
 ---[ Kasan shadow start ]---
 0x6ee00000-0x7af00000         193M     RW NX SHD MEM/CACHED/WBWA
 0x7b000000-0x7f000000          64M     ro NX SHD MEM/CACHED/WBWA
 ---[ Kasan shadow end ]---
 ---[ Modules ]---
 ---[ Kernel Mapping ]---
	......
 ---[ vmalloc() Area ]---
	......
 ---[ vmalloc() End ]---
 ---[ Fixmap Area ]---
 ---[ Vectors ]---
 	......
 ---[ Vectors End ]---
