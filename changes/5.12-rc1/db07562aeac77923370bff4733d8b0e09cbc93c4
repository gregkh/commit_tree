Makefile: reuse CC_VERSION_TEXT

I noticed we're invoking $(CC) via $(shell) more than once to check the
version.  Let's reuse the first string captured in $CC_VERSION_TEXT.

[masahiro.yamada:
CC_VERSION_TEXT is assigned by = instead of :=, so this $(shell ) is
evaluated multiple times anyway. The number of $(CC) invocations will
be still the same. Replacing 'grep' with the built-in $(findstring )
will give real performance benefit.]
