xen-blkback: fix error handling in xen_blkbk_map()

The function uses a goto-based loop, which may lead to an earlier error
getting discarded by a later iteration. Exit this ad-hoc loop when an
error was encountered.

The out-of-memory error path additionally fails to fill a structure
field looked at by xen_blkbk_unmap_prepare() before inspecting the
handle which does get properly set (to BLKBACK_INVALID_HANDLE).

Since the earlier exiting from the ad-hoc loop requires the same field
filling (invalidation) as that on the out-of-memory path, fold both
paths. While doing so, drop the pr_alert(), as extra log messages aren't
going to help the situation (the kernel will log oom conditions already
anyway).

This is XSA-365.
