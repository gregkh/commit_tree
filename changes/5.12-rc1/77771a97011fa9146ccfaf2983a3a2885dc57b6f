perf symbols: Fix return value when loading PE DSO

The first time dso__load() was called on a PE file it always returned -1
error. This caused the first call to map__find_symbol() to always fail
on a PE file so the first sample from each PE file always had symbol
<unknown>. Subsequent samples succeed however because the DSO is already
loaded.

This fixes dso__load() to return 0 when successfully loading a DSO with
libbfd.

Fixes: eac9a4342e5447ca ("perf symbols: Try reading the symbol table with libbfd")
