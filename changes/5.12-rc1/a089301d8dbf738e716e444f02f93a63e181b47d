drm/msm/dp: fix build after dp quirk helper change

Commit 7c553f8b5a7d ("drm/dp: Revert "drm/dp: Introduce EDID-based
quirks"") removed drm_dp_get_edid_quirks() and changed the signature of
drm_dp_has_quirk() while they were still being used in msm. Fix the
breakage. Functionally, removing the EDID-based quirks has no impact on
msm.

[The above commit was merged to drm-intel-next; make two wrongs a right
by merging this fix through drm-intel-next as well.]
