ACPI: platform: Add platform profile support

This is the initial implementation of the platform-profile feature.
It provides the details discussed and outlined in the
sysfs-platform_profile document.

Many modern systems have the ability to modify the operating profile to
control aspects like fan speed, temperature and power levels. This
module provides a common sysfs interface that platform modules can register
against to control their individual profile options.
