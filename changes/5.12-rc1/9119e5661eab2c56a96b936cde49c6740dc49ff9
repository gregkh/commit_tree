ALSA: usb-audio: Add DJM-450 to the quirks table

As with most Pioneer devices, the device descriptor is vendor specific
and as such, the number of channels, the PCM format, endpoints and
sample rate need to be specified. This device has 8 inputs and 8 outputs
and a sample rate of 48000 only. The PCM format is S24_3LE like other
devices.

There seems to be an appetite for reducing duplication amongs these
Pioneer patches but again, I feel this is a step to be taken after
support has been added as it's not completely clear where the
commonalities are.
