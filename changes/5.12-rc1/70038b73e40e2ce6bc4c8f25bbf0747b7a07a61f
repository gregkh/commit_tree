net/mlx5e: Add listener to trap event

Add support for listening to blocking events in the ETH driver. Listen
on trap event. If received, call mlx5e_handle_trap_event() which:
1) Verifies if driver needs open/close trap-RQ with respect to the
active traps count.
2) Inspects trap id and its action (trap/drop) and add/remove the flow
steering rule accordingly.
Otherwise, return an error.
