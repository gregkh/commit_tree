btrfs: zoned: reorder log node allocation on zoned filesystem

This is the 3/3 patch to enable tree-log on zoned filesystems.

The allocation order of nodes of "fs_info->log_root_tree" and nodes of
"root->log_root" is not the same as the writing order of them. So, the
writing causes unaligned write errors.

Reorder the allocation of them by delaying allocation of the root node of
"fs_info->log_root_tree," so that the node buffers can go out sequentially
to devices.
