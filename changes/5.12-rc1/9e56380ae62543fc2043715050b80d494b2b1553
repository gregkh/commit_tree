media: uvcvideo: Rename debug functions

trace isn't a good name as it's not a trace mechanism, it is a
typical debug mechanism.

Rename uvc_trace/uvc_trace_cont macros to uvc_dbg/uvc_dbg_cont.
Rename uvc_trace_param to uvc_dbg_param
Rename UVC_TRACE_<FOO> defines to UVC_DBG_<FOO>
Use ## concatenation in uvc_dbg macros to avoid overly long and
repetitive UVC_DBG uses
