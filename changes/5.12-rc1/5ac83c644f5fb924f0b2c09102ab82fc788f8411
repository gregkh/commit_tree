Revert "blk-mq, elevator: Count requests per hctx to improve performance"

This reverts commit b445547ec1bbd3e7bf4b1c142550942f70527d95.

Since both mq-deadline and BFQ completely ignore hctx they are passed to
their dispatch function and dispatch whatever request they deem fit
checking whether any request for a particular hctx is queued is just
pointless since we'll very likely get a request from a different hctx
anyway. In the following commit we'll deal with lock contention in these
IO schedulers in presence of multiple HW queues in a different way.
