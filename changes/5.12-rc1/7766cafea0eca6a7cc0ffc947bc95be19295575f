usb: bdc: Remove the BDC PCI driver

The BDC PCI driver was only used for design verification with
an PCI/FPGA board. The board no longer exists and is not in use
anywhere. All instances of this core now exist as a memory mapped
device on the platform bus.

NOTE: This only removes the PCI driver and does not remove the
platform driver.
