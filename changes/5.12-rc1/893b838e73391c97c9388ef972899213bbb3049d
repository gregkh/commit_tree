net: ipa: introduce __gsi_channel_start()

Create a new function that does most of the work of starting a
channel.  What's different is that it takes a flag indicating
whether the channel should really be started or not.  Create
another new function __gsi_channel_stop() that behaves similarly.

IPA v3.5.1 implements suspend using a special SUSPEND endpoint
setting.  If the endpoint is suspended when an I/O completes on the
underlying GSI channel, a SUSPEND interrupt is generated.

Newer versions of IPA do not implement the SUSPEND endpoint mode.
Instead, endpoint suspend is implemented by simply stopping the
underlying GSI channel.  In this case, a completing I/O on a
*stopped* channel causes the SUSPEND interrupt condition.

These new functions put all activity related to starting or stopping
a channel (including "thawing/freezing" the channel) in one place,
whether or not the channel is actually started or stopped.
