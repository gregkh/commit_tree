virt: acrn: Introduce PCI configuration space PIO accesses combiner

A User VM can access its virtual PCI configuration spaces via port IO
approach, which has two following steps:
 1) writes address into port 0xCF8
 2) put/get data in/from port 0xCFC

To distribute a complete PCI configuration space access one time, HSM
need to combine such two accesses together.

Combine two paired PIO I/O requests into one PCI I/O request and
continue the I/O request distribution.
