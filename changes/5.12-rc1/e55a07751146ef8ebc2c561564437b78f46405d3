drm/vc4: hdmi: Don't access the connector state in reset if kmalloc fails

drm_atomic_helper_connector_reset uses kmalloc which, from an API
standpoint, can fail, and thus setting connector->state to NULL.
However, our reset hook then calls drm_atomic_helper_connector_tv_reset
that will access connector->state without checking if it's a valid
pointer or not.

Make sure we don't end up accessing a NULL pointer.
