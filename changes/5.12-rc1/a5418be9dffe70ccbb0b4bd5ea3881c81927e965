sched/core: Rename schedutil_cpu_util() and allow rest of the kernel to use it

There is nothing schedutil specific in schedutil_cpu_util(), rename it
to effective_cpu_util(). Also create and expose another wrapper
sched_cpu_util() which can be used by other parts of the kernel, like
thermal core (that will be done in a later commit).
