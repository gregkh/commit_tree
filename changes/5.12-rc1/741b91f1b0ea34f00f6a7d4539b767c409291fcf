can: dev: can_put_echo_skb(): add software tx timestamps

Call skb_tx_timestamp() within can_put_echo_skb() so that a software tx
timestamp gets attached to the skb.

There two main reasons to include this call in can_put_echo_skb():

  * It easily allow to enable the tx timestamp on all devices with
    just one small change.

  * According to Documentation/networking/timestamping.rst, the tx
    timestamps should be generated in the device driver as close as possible,
    but always prior to passing the packet to the network interface. During the
    call to can_put_echo_skb(), the skb gets cloned meaning that the driver
    should not dereference the skb variable anymore after can_put_echo_skb()
    returns. This makes can_put_echo_skb() the very last place we can use the
    skb without having to access the echo_skb[] array.

Remark: by default, skb_tx_timestamp() does nothing. It needs to be activated
by passing the SOF_TIMESTAMPING_TX_SOFTWARE flag either through socket options
or control messages.

 * Support for the error queue in CAN RAW sockets (which is needed for
   tx timestamps) was introduced in:
