i2c: rcar: protect against supurious interrupts on V3U

V3U creates spurious interrupts which we need to handle. This costs time
until BUS_PHASE_DATA can be activated which is problematic for Gen2 SoCs
and earlier. Because of this we introduce two interrupt handlers here
which will call a generic main irq function once the timing critical
stuff is done.
