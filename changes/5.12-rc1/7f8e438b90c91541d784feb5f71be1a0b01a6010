media: allegro: add HEVC NAL unit generator

When encoding a video as HEVC, the allegro driver needs to generate the
Non-VCL NAL units for HEVC. Do the same as for H.264 and add a module
that takes C structs for the VPS/SPS/PPS and encodes the fields as RBPS
as specified by "ITU-T Rec. H.265 (02/2018) high efficiency video
coding".
