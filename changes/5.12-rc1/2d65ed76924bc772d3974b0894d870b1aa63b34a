net: ipa: fix register write command validation

In ipa_cmd_register_write_valid() we verify that values we will
supply to a REGISTER_WRITE IPA immediate command will fit in
the fields that need to hold them.  This patch fixes some issues
in that function and ipa_cmd_register_write_offset_valid().

The dev_err() call in ipa_cmd_register_write_offset_valid() has
some printf format errors:
  - The name of the register (corresponding to the string format
    specifier) was not supplied.
  - The IPA base offset and offset need to be supplied separately to
    match the other format specifiers.
Also make the ~0 constant used there to compute the maximum
supported offset value explicitly unsigned.

There are two other issues in ipa_cmd_register_write_valid():
  - There's no need to check the hash flush register for platforms
    (like IPA v4.2) that do not support hashed tables
  - The highest possible endpoint number, whose status register
    offset is computed, is COUNT - 1, not COUNT.

Fix these problems, and add some additional commentary.
