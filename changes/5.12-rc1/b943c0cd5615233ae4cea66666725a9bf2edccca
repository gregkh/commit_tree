xfs: hide xfs_icache_free_cowblocks

Change the one remaining caller of xfs_icache_free_cowblocks to use our
new combined blockgc scan function instead, since we will soon be
combining the two scans.  This introduces a slight behavior change,
since a readonly remount now clears out post-EOF preallocations and not
just CoW staging extents.
