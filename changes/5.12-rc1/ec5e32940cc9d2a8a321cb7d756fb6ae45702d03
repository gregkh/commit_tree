vfio: iommu driver notify callback

Define a vfio_iommu_driver_ops notify callback, for sending events to
the driver.  Drivers are not required to provide the callback, and
may ignore any events.  The handling of events is driver specific.

Define the CONTAINER_CLOSE event, called when the container's file
descriptor is closed.  This event signifies that no further state changes
will occur via container ioctl's.
