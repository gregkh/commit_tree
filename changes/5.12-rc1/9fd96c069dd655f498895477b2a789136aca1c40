drm/i915/gt: Move move context layout registers and offsets to lrc_reg.h

Cleanup intel_lrc.h by moving some of the residual common register
definitions into intel_lrc_reg.h, prior to rebranding and splitting off
the submission backends.

v2: keep the SCHEDULE enum in the old file, since it is specific to the
gvt usage of the execlists submission backend (John)
