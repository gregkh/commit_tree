perf/intel: Remove Perfmon-v4 counter_freezing support

Perfmon-v4 counter freezing is fundamentally broken; remove this default
disabled code to make sure nobody uses it.

The feature is called Freeze-on-PMI in the SDM, and if it would do that,
there wouldn't actually be a problem, *however* it does something subtly
different. It globally disables the whole PMU when it raises the PMI,
not when the PMI hits.

This means there's a window between the PMI getting raised and the PMI
actually getting served where we loose events and this violates the
perf counter independence. That is, a counting event should not result
in a different event count when there is a sampling event co-scheduled.

This is known to break existing software (RR).
