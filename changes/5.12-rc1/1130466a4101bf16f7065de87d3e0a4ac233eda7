ARM: dts: mmp3-dell-ariel: Drop linux,usable-memory from /memory

Drop the linux,usable-memory properties; the schema is unhappy about
them.

They've been cargo-culted from Open Firmware and I don't know what
purpose they serve. Perhaps they are meant to provide the OFW runtime.
In that case it's still okay to drop them from here; OFW is welcome to add
it upon boot.
