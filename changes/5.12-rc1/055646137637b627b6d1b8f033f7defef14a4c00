video: fbdev: aty: Fix set but not used warnings in mach64_ct

Fix W=1 warnings about variables assigned but never used.
- One variable is only used when CONFIG_FB_ATY_GENERIC_LCD is defined
  Fix so variable is only defined with CONFIG_FB_ATY_GENERIC_LCD
- Several variables was only assigned by a call to aty_ld_le32().
  Drop the variables but keep the call to aty_ld_le32() as it may
  have unexpected side-effects.
