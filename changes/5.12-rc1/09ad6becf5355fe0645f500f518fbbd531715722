nexthop: Use enum to encode notification type

Currently there are only two types of in-kernel nexthop notification.
The two are distinguished by the 'is_grp' boolean field in 'struct
nh_notifier_info'.

As more notification types are introduced for more next-hop group types, a
boolean is not an easily extensible interface. Instead, convert it to an
enum.
