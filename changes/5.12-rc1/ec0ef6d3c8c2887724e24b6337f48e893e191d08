net: ipa: don't return an error from ipa_interconnect_disable()

If disabling interconnects fails there's not a lot we can do.  The
only two callers of ipa_interconnect_disable() ignore the return
value, so just give the function a void return type.

Print an error message if disabling any of the interconnects is not
successful.  Return (and print) only the first error seen.
