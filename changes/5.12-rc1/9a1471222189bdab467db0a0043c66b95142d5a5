PCI: Remove WARN_ON(in_interrupt())

WARN_ON(in_interrupt()) is used for historic reasons to ensure proper usage
of down_read() and predates might_sleep() and lockdep.

down_read() has might_sleep() which also catches users from preemption
disabled regions while in_interrupt() does not.

Remove WARN_ON(in_interrupt()) because there are now better debugging
facilities.
