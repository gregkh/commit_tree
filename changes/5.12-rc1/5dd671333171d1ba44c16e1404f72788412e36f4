RISC-V: probes: Treat the instruction stream as host-endian

Neither of these are actually correct: the instruction stream is defined
(for versions of the ISA manual newer than 2.2) as a stream of 16-bit
little-endian parcels, which is different than just being little-endian.
In theory we should represent this as a type, but we don't have any
concrete plans for the big endian stuff so it doesn't seem worth the
time -- we've got variants of this all over the place.

Instead I'm just dropping the unnecessary type conversion, which is a
NOP on LE systems but causes an sparse error as the types are all mixed
up.
