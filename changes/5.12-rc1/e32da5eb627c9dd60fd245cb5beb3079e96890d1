ALSA: bebob: remove an unnecessary condition in hwdep_read()

Drivers in ALSA firewire stack supports eventing to userspace
applications via ALSA hwdep interface. All of the drivers supports stream
lock events. Some of them supports their unique events according to
specification of target device.

ALSA bebob driver supports the stream lock event only. In the case, it's
enough to check condition only in loop with process blocking. However,
current implementation check it again after breaking the loop.

This commit removes the redundant check.
