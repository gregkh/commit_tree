drm/i915/gt: Limit VFE threads based on GT

MEDIA_STATE_VFE only accepts the 'maximum number of threads' in the
range [0, n-1] where n is #EU * (#threads/EU) with the number of threads
based on plaform and the number of EU based on the number of slices and
subslices. This is a fixed number per platform/gt, so appropriately
limit the number of threads we spawn to match the device.

v2: Oversaturate the system with tasks to force execution on every HW
thread; if the thread idles it is returned to the pool and may be reused
again before an unused thread.

v3: Fix more state commands, which was causing Baytrail to barf.
v4: STATE_CACHE_INVALIDATE requires a stall on Ivybridge
