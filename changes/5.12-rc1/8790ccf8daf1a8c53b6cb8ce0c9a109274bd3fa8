MIPS: Compare __SYNC_loongson3_war against 0

When building with clang when CONFIG_CPU_LOONGSON3_WORKAROUNDS is
enabled:

While it is not wrong that the result of this shift is always true in a
boolean context, it is not a problem here. Regardless, the warning is
really noisy so rather than making the shift a boolean implicitly, use
it in an equality comparison so the shift is used as an integer value.
