cfg80211: fix netdev registration deadlock

If register_netdevice() fails after having called cfg80211's
netdev notifier (cfg80211_netdev_notifier_call) it will call
the notifier again with UNREGISTER. This would then lock the
wiphy mutex because we're marked as registered, which causes
a deadlock.

Fix this by separately keeping track of whether or not we're
in the middle of registering to also skip the notifier call
on this unregister.
