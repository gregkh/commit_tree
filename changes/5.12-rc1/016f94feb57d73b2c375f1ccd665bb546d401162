ALSA: hda: Drop power save deny list entry for Clevo W65_67SB

As the runtime PM issue was addressed by the recent fix 4961167bf748
("ALSA: hda/via: Apply the workaround generically for Clevo machines")
for VIA codecs, we need no longer to keep the Clevo device off from
the power saving as default.  Drop the deny list entry accordingly.
