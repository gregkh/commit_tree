vmlinux.lds.h: add DWARF v5 sections

We expect toolchains to produce these new debug info sections as part of
DWARF v5. Add explicit placements to prevent the linker warnings from
--orphan-section=warn.

Compilers may produce such sections with explicit -gdwarf-5, or based on
the implicit default version of DWARF when -g is used via DEBUG_INFO.
This implicit default changes over time, and has changed to DWARF v5
with GCC 11.

.debug_sup was mentioned in review, but without compilers producing it
today, let's wait to add it until it becomes necessary.
