io_uring: save ctx put/get for task_work submit

Do a little trick in io_ring_ctx_free() briefly taking uring_lock, that
will wait for everyone currently holding it, so we can skip pinning ctx
with ctx->refs for __io_req_task_submit(), which is executed and loses
its refs/reqs while holding the lock.
