arm64: dts: renesas: r8a774b1: Introduce beacon-rzg2n-kit

Beacon EmbeddedWorks is introducing a new kit based on the
RZ/G2N SoC from Renesas.

The SOM supports eMMC, WiFi and Bluetooth, along with a Cat-M1
cellular radio.

The Baseboard has Ethernet, USB, HDMI, stereo audio in and out,
along with a variety of push buttons and LED's, and support for
a parallel RGB and an LVDS display.  It uses the same baseboard
and SOM as the RZ/G2M.

This SOM has only 2GB of DDR, and beacon-renesom-som.dtsi contains
the base memory node, so an additional memory node isn't necessary.
