mm/slub: disable user tracing for kmemleak caches by default

If kmemleak is enabled, it uses a kmem cache for its own objects.  These
objects are used to hold information kmemleak uses, including a stack
trace.  If slub_debug is also turned on, each of them has *another* stack
trace, so the overhead adds up, and on my tests (on ARCH=um, admittedly)
2/3rds of the allocations end up being doing the stack tracing.

Turn off SLAB_STORE_USER if SLAB_NOLEAKTRACE was given, to avoid storing
the essentially same data twice.
