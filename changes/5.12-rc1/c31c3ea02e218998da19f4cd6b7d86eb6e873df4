serial: stm32: update transmission complete error message in shutdown

The transmission complete error message provides the status of the
ISR_USART_TC bit. This bit, when set, indicates that the transmission
has not been completed.
The bit status indication is not a very understandable information.
The error message sent on console should indicate that the transmission is
not complete, instead of providing USART_TC bit status.
Update the error message and add a comment for better understanding.
