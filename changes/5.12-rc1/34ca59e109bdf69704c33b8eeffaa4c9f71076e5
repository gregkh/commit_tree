objtool: Fix ".cold" section suffix check for newer versions of GCC

With my version of GCC 9.3.1 the ".cold" subfunctions no longer have a
numbered suffix, so the trailing period is no longer there.

Presumably this doesn't yet trigger a user-visible bug since most of the
subfunction detection logic is duplicated.   I only found it when
testing vmlinux.o validation.
