xen/netback: fix spurious event detection for common event case

In case of a common event for rx and tx queue the event should be
regarded to be spurious if no rx and no tx requests are pending.

Unfortunately the condition for testing that is wrong causing to
decide a event being spurious if no rx OR no tx requests are
pending.

Fix that plus using local variables for rx/tx pending indicators in
order to split function calls and if condition.
