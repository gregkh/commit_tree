drm/i915/gt: rename wa_write_masked_or()

The use of "masked" in this function is due to its history. Once upon a
time it received a mask and a value as parameter. Since
commit eeec73f8a4a4 ("drm/i915/gt: Skip rmw for masked registers")
that is not true anymore and now there is a clear and a set parameter.
Depending on the case, that can still be thought as a mask and value,
but there are some subtle differences: what we clear doesn't need to be
the same bits we are setting, particularly when we are using masked
registers.

The fact that we also have "masked registers", i.e. registers whose mask
is stored in the upper 16 bits of the register, makes it even more
confusing, because "masked" in wa_write_masked_or() has little to do
with masked registers, but rather refers to the old mask parameter the
function received (that can also, but not exclusively, be used to write
to masked register).

Avoid the ambiguity and misnomer by renaming it to something else,
hopefully less confusing: wa_write_clr_set(), to designate that we are
doing both clr and set operations in the register.
