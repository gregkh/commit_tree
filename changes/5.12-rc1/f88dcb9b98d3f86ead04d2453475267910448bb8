ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: detect DMIC number based on mach params

Current driver create DMIC dai based on quirk for each platforms,

number to machine driver and machine driver can create DMIC dai based
on this information. The old check is reserved for some platforms
may be failed to set the DMIC number in BIOS.
