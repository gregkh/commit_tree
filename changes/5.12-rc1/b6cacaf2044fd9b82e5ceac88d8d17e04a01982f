scsi: ufs: ufs-debugfs: Add error counters

People testing have a need to know how many errors might be occurring over
time. Add error counters and expose them via debugfs.

A module initcall is used to create a debugfs root directory for
ufshcd-related items. In the case that modules are built-in, then
initialization is done in link order, so move ufshcd-core to the top of the
Makefile.
