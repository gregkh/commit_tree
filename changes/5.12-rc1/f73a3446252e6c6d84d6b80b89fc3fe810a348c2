KVM: selftests: Add memslot modification stress test

Add a memslot modification stress test in which a memslot is repeatedly
created and removed while vCPUs access memory in another memslot. Most
userspaces do not create or remove memslots on running VMs which makes
it hard to test races in adding and removing memslots without a
dedicated test. Adding and removing a memslot also has the effect of
tearing down the entire paging structure, which leads to more page
faults and pressure on the page fault handling path than a one-and-done
memory population test.
