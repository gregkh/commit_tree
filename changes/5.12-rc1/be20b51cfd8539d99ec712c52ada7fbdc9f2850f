scsi: ufs: Distinguish between query REQ and query RSP in query trace

Currently, in the query completion trace print, since we use
hba->lrb[tag].ucd_req_ptr and didn't differentiate UPIU between request and
response, thus header and transaction-specific field in UPIU printed by
query trace are identical. This is not very practical. As below:

query_send: HDR:16 00 00 0e 00 81 00 00 00 00 00 00, CDB:06 0e 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
query_complete: HDR:16 00 00 0e 00 81 00 00 00 00 00 00, CDB:06 0e 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00

For the failure analysis, we want to understand the real response reported
by the UFS device, however, the current query trace tells us nothing. After
this patch, the query trace on the query_send, and the above a pair of
query_send and query_complete will be:

query_send: HDR:16 00 00 0e 00 81 00 00 00 00 00 00, CDB:06 0e 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00
ufshcd_upiu: HDR:36 00 00 0e 00 81 00 00 00 00 00 00, CDB:06 0e 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 00
