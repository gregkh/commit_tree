coresight: etm4x: Convert all register accesses

Convert all register accesses from etm4x driver to use a wrapper
to allow switching the access at runtime with little overhead.

co-developed by sed tool ;-), mostly equivalent to :

s/readl\(_relaxed\)\?(drvdata->base + \(.*\))/etm4x_\1_read32(csdev, \2)
s/writel\(_relaxed\)\?(\(.*\), drvdata->base + \(.*\))/etm4x_\1_write32(csdev, \2, \3)

We don't want to replace them with the csdev_access_* to
avoid a function call for every register access for system
register access. This is a prepartory step to add system
register access later where the support is available.
