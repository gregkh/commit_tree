scsi: lpfc: Fix target reset failing

Target reset is failed by the target as an invalid command.

The Target Reset TMF has been obsoleted in T10 for a while, but continues
to be used. On (newer) devices, the TMF is rejected causing the reset
handler to escalate to adapter resets.

Fix by having Target Reset TMF rejections be translated into a LOGO and
re-PLOGI with the target device. This provides the same semantic action
(although, if the device also supports nvme traffic, it will terminate nvme
traffic as well - but it's still recoverable).
