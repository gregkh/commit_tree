selftests/bpf: Install btf_dump test cases

The btf_dump test cannot access the original source files for comparison
when running the selftests out of tree, causing several failures:

awk: btf_dump_test_case_syntax.c: No such file or directory
...

Add those files to $(TEST_FILES) to have "make install" pick them up.
