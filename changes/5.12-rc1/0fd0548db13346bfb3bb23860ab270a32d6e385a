rcutorture: Add writer-side tests of polling grace-period API

This commit adds writer-side testing of the polling grace-period API.
One test verifies that the polling API sees a grace period caused by
some other mechanism.  Another test verifies that using the polling API
to wait for a grace period does not result in too-short grace periods.
A third test verifies that the polling API does not report
completion within a read-side critical section.  A fourth and final
test verifies that the polling API does report completion given an
intervening grace period.
