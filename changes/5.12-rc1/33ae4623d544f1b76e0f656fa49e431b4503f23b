rtlwifi: rtl8192se: fix bool comparison in expressions

There are certain conditional expressions in rtl8192se, where a boolean
variable is compared with true/false, in forms such as (foo == true) or
(false != bar), which does not comply with checkpatch.pl (CHECK:
BOOL_COMPARISON), according to which boolean variables should be
themselves used in the condition, rather than comparing with true/false

Replace all such expressions with the bool variables appropriately
