fs: don't call ->dirty_inode for lazytime timestamp updates

There is no need to call ->dirty_inode for lazytime timestamp updates
(i.e. for __mark_inode_dirty(I_DIRTY_TIME)), since by the definition of
lazytime, filesystems must ignore these updates.  Filesystems only need
to care about the updated timestamps when they expire.

Therefore, only call ->dirty_inode when I_DIRTY_INODE is set.
