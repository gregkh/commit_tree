mm/rmap: correct some obsolete comments of anon_vma

commit 2b575eb64f7a ("mm: convert anon_vma->lock to a mutex") changed
spinlock used to serialize access to vma list to mutex.  And further, the
commit 5a505085f043 ("mm/rmap: Convert the struct anon_vma::mutex to an
rwsem") converted the mutex to an rwsem for solving scalability problem.
So replace spinlock with rwsem to make comment uptodate.
