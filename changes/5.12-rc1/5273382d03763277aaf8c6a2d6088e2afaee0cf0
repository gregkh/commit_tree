media: device property: Return true in fwnode_device_is_available for NULL ops

Some types of fwnode_handle do not implement the device_is_available()
check, such as those created by software_nodes. There isn't really a
meaningful way to check for the availability of a device that doesn't
actually exist, so if the check isn't implemented just assume that the
"device" is present.
