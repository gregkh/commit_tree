udp_tunnel: reshuffle NETIF_F_RX_UDP_TUNNEL_PORT checks

Move the NETIF_F_RX_UDP_TUNNEL_PORT feature check into
udp_tunnel_nic_*_port() helpers, since they're always
done right before the call.

Add similar checks before calling the notifier.
udp_tunnel_nic invokes the notifier without checking
features which could result in some wasted cycles.
