x86/asm: Fixup TASK_SIZE_MAX comment

Comment says "by preventing anything executable" which is not true. Even
PROT_NONE mapping can't be installed at (1<<47 - 4096).

  mmap(0x7ffffffff000, 4096, PROT_NONE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_FIXED|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = -1 ENOMEM

 [ bp: Fixup to the moved location in page_64_types.h. ]
