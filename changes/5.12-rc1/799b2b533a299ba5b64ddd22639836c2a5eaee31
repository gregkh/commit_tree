HID: playstation: add DualSense Bluetooth support.

This patch adds support for the DualSense when operating in Bluetooth mode.
The device has the same behavior as the DualShock 4 in that by default it
sends a limited input report (0x1), but after requesting calibration data,
it switches to an extended input report (report 49), which adds data for
touchpad, motion sensors, battery and more.
