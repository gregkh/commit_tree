fix handling of nd->depth on LOOKUP_CACHED failures in try_to_unlazy*

After switching to non-RCU mode, we want nd->depth to match the number
of entries in nd->stack[] that need eventual path_put().
legitimize_links() takes care of that on failures; unfortunately,
failure exits added for LOOKUP_CACHED do not.

We could add the logics for that into those failure exits, both in
try_to_unlazy() and in try_to_unlazy_next(), but since both checks
are immediately followed by legitimize_links() and there's no calls
of legitimize_links() other than those two...  It's easier to
move the check (and required handling of nd->depth on failure) into
legitimize_links() itself.

[caught by Jens: ... and since we are zeroing ->depth here, we need
to do drop_links() first]
