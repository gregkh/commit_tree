net: ethernet: ti: am65-cpsw-nuss: Use DMA device for DMA API

For DMA API the DMA device should be used as cpsw does not accesses to
descriptors or data buffers in any ways. The DMA does.

Also, drop dma_coerce_mask_and_coherent() setting on CPSW device, as it
should be done by DMA driver which does data movement.

This is required for adding AM64x CPSW3g support where DMA coherency
supported per DMA channel.
