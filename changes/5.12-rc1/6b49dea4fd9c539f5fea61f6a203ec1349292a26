platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: add "always on USB charging" control support

Certain models have a so-called "always on USB charging" feature,
which enables USB charging even when the computer is turned off
or suspended, and which may be controlled/queried using the
SALS/HALS ACPI methods. Expose this functionality via a new device
attribute (usb_charging). Tested on: Lenovo YOGA 520-14IKB 80X8
