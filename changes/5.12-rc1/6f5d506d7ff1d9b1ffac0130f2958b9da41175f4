ASoC: SOF: Intel: SoundWire: refine ACPI match

We have existing platforms where the wrong machine is selected. We

what we expect for a link descriptor. This helps avoid using the
TGL-RVP configuration for an HP platform or vice-versa, depending on
the order in which they are inserted in the table.
