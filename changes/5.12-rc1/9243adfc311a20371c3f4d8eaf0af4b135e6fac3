skbuff: queue NAPI_MERGED_FREE skbs into NAPI cache instead of freeing

napi_frags_finish() and napi_skb_finish() can only be called inside
NAPI Rx context, so we can feed NAPI cache with skbuff_heads that
got NAPI_MERGED_FREE verdict instead of immediate freeing.
Replace __kfree_skb() with __kfree_skb_defer() in napi_skb_finish()
and move napi_skb_free_stolen_head() to skbuff.c, so it can drop skbs
to NAPI cache.
As many drivers call napi_alloc_skb()/napi_get_frags() on their
receive path, this becomes especially useful.
