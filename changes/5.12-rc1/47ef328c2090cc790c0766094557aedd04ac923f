iwlwifi: pcie: Disable softirqs during Rx queue init

When Rx queues are configured during module init, NAPI is enabled
while the Rx queue lock is held. However, since softirqs are not
disabled, it is possible that and IRQ would fire and call
iwl_pcie_rx_handle() which would also try to acquire the Rx lock.

Prevent this by disabling softirqs during Rx queue configuration,
as part of module init flow.
