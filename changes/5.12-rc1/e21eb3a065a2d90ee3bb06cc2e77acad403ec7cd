gtp: set initial MTU

The GTP link is brought up with a default MTU of zero.  This can lead to
some rather unexpected behaviour for users who are more accustomed to
interfaces coming online with reasonable defaults.

This patch sets an initial MTU for the GTP link of 1500 less worst-case
tunnel overhead.
