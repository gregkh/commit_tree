ASoC: simple-card-utils: Fix device module clock

If "clocks = <&xxx>" is specified from the CPU or Codec component
device node, the clock is not getting enabled. Thus audio playback
or capture fails.

Fix this by populating "simple_dai->clk" field when clocks property
is specified from device node as well. Also tidy up by re-organising
conditional statements of parsing logic.
