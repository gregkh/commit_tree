net: mscc: ocelot: store a namespaced VCAP filter ID

We will be adding some private VCAP filters that should not interfere in
any way with the filters added using tc-flower. So we need to allocate
some IDs which will not be used by tc.

Currently ocelot uses an u32 id derived from the flow cookie, which in
itself is an unsigned long. This is a problem in itself, since on 64 bit
systems, sizeof(unsigned long)=8, so the driver is already truncating
these.

Create a struct ocelot_vcap_id which contains the full unsigned long
cookie from tc, as well as a boolean that is supposed to namespace the
filters added by tc with the ones that aren't.
