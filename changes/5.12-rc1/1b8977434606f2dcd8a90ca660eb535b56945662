drm: add legacy support for using degamma for gamma

The DRM core handles legacy gamma-set ioctl by setting GAMMA_LUT and
clearing CTM and DEGAMMA_LUT.

This works fine on HW where we have either:

degamma -> ctm -> gamma -> out

or

ctm -> gamma -> out

However, if the HW has gamma table before ctm, the atomic property
should be DEGAMMA_LUT, and thus we have:

degamma -> ctm -> out

This is fine for userspace which sets gamma table using the properties,
as the userspace can check for the existence of gamma & degamma, but the
legacy gamma-set ioctl does not work.

Change the DRM core to use DEGAMMA_LUT instead of GAMMA_LUT when the
latter is unavailable.
