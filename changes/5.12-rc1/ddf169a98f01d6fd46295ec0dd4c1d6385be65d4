crypto: aesni - implement support for cts(cbc(aes))

Follow the same approach as the arm64 driver for implementing a version
of AES-NI in CBC mode that supports ciphertext stealing. This results in
a ~2x speed increase for relatively short inputs (less than 256 bytes),
which is relevant given that AES-CBC with ciphertext stealing is used
for filename encryption in the fscrypt layer. For larger inputs, the
speedup is still significant (~25% on decryption, ~6% on encryption)
