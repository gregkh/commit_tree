drm/msm/dpu: Add prog_fetch_lines_worst_case to INTF_BLK macro

Not all DPU interface sub-block versions need the same value for
prog_fetch_lines_worst_case: add this to the INTF_BLK macro, so
that it becomes possible to vary it for other INTF versions.

For example, this is needed to implement support for older SoCs,
like MSM8998 and SDM630/660 and most probably will also be needed
for future SoCs.
