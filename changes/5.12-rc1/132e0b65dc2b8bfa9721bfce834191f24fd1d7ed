bnxt_en: reverse order of TX disable and carrier off

A TX queue can potentially immediately timeout after it is stopped
and the last TX timestamp on that queue was more than 5 seconds ago with
carrier still up.  Prevent these intermittent false TX timeouts
by bringing down carrier first before calling netif_tx_disable().
