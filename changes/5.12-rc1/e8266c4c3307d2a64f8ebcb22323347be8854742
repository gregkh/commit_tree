VMCI: Stop log spew when qp allocation isn't possible

VMCI queue pair allocation is disabled, if a VM is in FT mode. In
these cases, VMware Tools may still once in a while attempt to
create a vSocket stream connection, resulting in multiple
warnings in the kernel logs. Therefore downgrade the error log to
a debug log.
