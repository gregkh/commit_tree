perf stat: Use nftw() instead of ftw()

ftw() has been obsolete for about 12 years now.

Committer notes:

Further notes provided by the patch author:

    "NOTE: Not runtime-tested, I have no idea what I need to do in perf
     to test this. But at least it compiles now with my uClibc-based
     toolchain."

I looked at the nftw()/ftw() man page and for the use made with cgroups
in 'perf stat' the end result is equivalent.

Fixes: bb1c15b60b98 ("perf stat: Support regex pattern in --for-each-cgroup")
