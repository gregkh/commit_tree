RDMA/hns: Create CQ with selected CQN for bank load balance

In order to improve performance by balancing the load between different
banks of cache, the CQC cache is desigend to choose one of 4 banks
according to lower 2 bits of CQN. The hns driver needs to count the number
of CQ on each bank and then assigns the CQ being created to the bank with
the minimum load first.
