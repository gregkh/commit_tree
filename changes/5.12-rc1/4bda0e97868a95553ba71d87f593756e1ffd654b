KVM: x86: Add a helper to check for a legal GPA

Add a helper to check for a legal GPA, and use it to consolidate code
in existing, related helpers.  Future patches will extend usage to
VMX and SVM code, properly handle exceptions to the maxphyaddr rule, and
add more helpers.

No functional change intended.
