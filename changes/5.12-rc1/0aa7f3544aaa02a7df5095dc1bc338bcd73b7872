mm/hugetlb: avoid unnecessary hugetlb_acct_memory() call

When reservation accounting remains unchanged, hugetlb_acct_memory() will
do nothing except holding and releasing hugetlb_lock.  We should avoid
this unnecessary hugetlb_lock lock/unlock cycle which is happening on
'most' hugetlb munmap operations by check delta against 0 at the beginning
of hugetlb_acct_memory.
