PCI: xgene-msi: Fix race in installing chained irq handler

Fix a race where a pending interrupt could be received and the handler
called before the handler's data has been setup, by converting to
irq_set_chained_handler_and_data().

See also 2cf5a03cb29d ("PCI/keystone: Fix race in installing chained IRQ
handler").

Based on the mail discussion, it seems ok to drop the error handling.
