stat: handle idmapped mounts

The generic_fillattr() helper fills in the basic attributes associated
with an inode. Enable it to handle idmapped mounts. If the inode is
accessed through an idmapped mount map it into the mount's user
namespace before we store the uid and gid. If the initial user namespace
is passed nothing changes so non-idmapped mounts will see identical
behavior as before.
