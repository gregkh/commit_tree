net: hns3: RSS indirection table use device specification

As RSS indirection table size may be different in different
hardware. Instead of using macro, this value is better to use
device specification which querying from firmware.

BTW, RSS indirection table should be allocated by the queried
size instead the static array.

.get_rss_indir_size in struct hnae3_ae_ops is not used now,
so remove it as well.
