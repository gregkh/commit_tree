btrfs: split alloc_log_tree()

This is a preparation patch for the next patch. Split alloc_log_tree()
into two parts. The first one allocating the tree structure, remains in
alloc_log_tree() and the second part allocating the tree node, which is
moved into btrfs_alloc_log_tree_node().

Also export the latter part is to be used in the next patch.
