net/af_iucv: count packets in the xmit path

The TX code keeps track of all skbs that are in-flight but haven't
actually been sent out yet. For native IUCV sockets that's not a huge
deal, but with TRANS_HIPER sockets it would be much better if we
didn't need to maintain a list of skb clones.

Note that we actually only care about the _count_ of skbs in this stage
of the TX pipeline. So as prep work for removing the skb tracking on
TRANS_HIPER sockets, keep track of the skb count in a separate variable
and pair any list {enqueue, unlink} with a count {increment, decrement}.

Then replace all occurences where we currently look at the skb list's
fill level.
