serial: core: Remove BUG_ON(in_interrupt()) check

The usage of in_interrupt() in drivers is phased out for various
reasons.

In both exported functions where BUG_ON(in_interrupt()) is invoked,
there is a mutex_lock() afterwards. mutex_lock() contains a
might_sleep() which will already trigger a stack trace if the target
functions is called from atomic context.

Remove the BUG_ON() and add a "Context: " in the kernel-doc instead.
