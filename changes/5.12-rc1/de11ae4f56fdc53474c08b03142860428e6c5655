selftests/bpf: Enable cross-building

Build bpftool and resolve_btfids using the host toolchain when
cross-compiling, since they are executed during build to generate the
selftests. Add a host build directory in order to build both host and
target version of libbpf. Build host tools using $(HOSTCC) defined in
Makefile.include.
