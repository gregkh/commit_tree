mlxsw: Register physical ports as a devlink resource

The switch ASIC has a limited capacity of physical ('flavour physical'
in devlink terminology) ports that it can support. While each system is
brought up with a different number of ports, this number can be
increased via splitting up to the ASIC's limit.

Expose physical ports as a devlink resource so that user space will have
visibility to the maximum number of ports that can be supported and the
current occupancy.

In addition, add a "Generic Resources" section in devlink-resource
documentation so the different drivers will be aligned by the same resource
name when exposing to user space.
