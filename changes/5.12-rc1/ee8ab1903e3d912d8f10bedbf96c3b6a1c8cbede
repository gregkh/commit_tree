mm: rmap: explicitly reset vma->anon_vma in unlink_anon_vmas()

In case the vma will continue to be used after unlink its relevant
anon_vma, we need to reset the vma->anon_vma pointer to NULL.  So, later
when fault happen within this vma again, a new anon_vma will be prepared.

By this way, the vma will only be checked for reverse mapping of pages
which been fault in after the unlink_anon_vmas call.

Currently, the mremap with MREMAP_DONTUNMAP scenario will continue use the
vma after moved its page table entries to a new vma.  For other scenarios,
the vma itself will be freed after call unlink_anon_vmas.
