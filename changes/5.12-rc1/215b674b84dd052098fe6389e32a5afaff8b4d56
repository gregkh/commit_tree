security: add inode_init_security_anon() LSM hook

This change adds a new LSM hook, inode_init_security_anon(), that will
be used while creating secure anonymous inodes. The hook allows/denies
its creation and assigns a security context to the inode.

The new hook accepts an optional context_inode parameter that callers
can use to provide additional contextual information to security modules
for granting/denying permission to create an anon-inode of the same type.
This context_inode's security_context can also be used to initialize the
newly created anon-inode's security_context.
