r8169: improve handling D3 PLL power-down

Realtek provided a description of bits 6 and 7 in register PMCH.
They configure whether the chip powers down certain PLL in D3hot and
D3cold respectively. They do not actually power down the PLL.
Reflect this in the code and configure D3 PLL powerdown based on
whether WOL is enabled.
