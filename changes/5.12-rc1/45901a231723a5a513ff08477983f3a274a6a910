NFSv4: Fixes for nfs4_bitmask_adjust()

We don't want to ask for the ACL in a WRITE reply, since we don't have
a preallocated buffer.

Instead of checking NFS_INO_INVALID_ACCESS, which is really about
managing the access cache, we should look at the value of
NFS_INO_INVALID_OTHER. Also ensure we assign the mode, owner and
owner_group flags to the correct bit mask.

Finally, fix up the check for NFS_INO_INVALID_CTIME to retrieve the
ctime, and add a check for NFS_INO_INVALID_CHANGE.
