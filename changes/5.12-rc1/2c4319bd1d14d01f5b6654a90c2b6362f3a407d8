rcutorture: Test runtime toggling of CPUs' callback offloading

Frederic Weisbecker is adding the ability to change the rcu_nocbs state
of CPUs at runtime, that is, to offload and deoffload their RCU callback
processing without the need to reboot.  As the old saying goes, "if it
ain't tested, it don't work", so this commit therefore adds prototype
rcutorture testing for this capability.
