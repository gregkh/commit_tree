ACPI: video: Clean up printing messages

Replace the ACPI_DEBUG_PRINT() instances in acpi_video.c with
acpi_handle_debug() calls and the ACPI_EXCEPTION()/ACPI_ERROR()/
ACPI_WARNING() instances in there with acpi_handle_info() calls,
which among other things causes the excessive log levels of those
messages to be increased.

Drop the _COMPONENT and ACPI_MODULE_NAME() definitions that are not
used any more from acpi_video.c, drop the no longer needed
ACPI_VIDEO_COMPONENT definition from the headers and update the
documentation accordingly.

While at it, add a pr_fmt() definition to acpi_video.c, replace the
direct printk() invocations in there with acpi_handle_info() or
pr_info() (and reduce the excessive log level where applicable) and
drop the PREFIX sybmbol definition which is not necessary any more
from acpi_video.c.

Also make unrelated janitorial changes to fix up white space and
use ACPI_FAILURE() instead of negating ACPI_SUCCESS().
