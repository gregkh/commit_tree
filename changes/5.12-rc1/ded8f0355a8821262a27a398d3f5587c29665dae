media: i2c: rdacm20: Constify static structs

The only usage of rdacm20_video_ops is to assign it to the video field
in the v4l2_subdev_ops struct which is a pointer to const,  and the only
usage of rdacm20_subdev_ops is to pass its address to
v4l2_i2c_subdev_init() which accepts a pointer to const. Make them const
to allow the compiler to put them in read-only memory.
