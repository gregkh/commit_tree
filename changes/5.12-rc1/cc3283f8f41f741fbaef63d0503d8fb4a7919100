drm/fourcc: fix Amlogic format modifier masks

The comment says the layout and options use 8 bits, and the shift
uses 8 bits. However the mask is 0xf, ie. 0b00001111 (4 bits).

This could be surprising when introducing new layouts or options
that take more than 4 bits, as this would silently drop the high
bits.

Make the masks consistent with the comment and the shift.

Found when writing a drm_info patch [1].
