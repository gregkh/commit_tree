ice: display stored netlist versions via devlink info

Add a function to read the inactive netlist bank for version
information. To support this, refactor how we read the netlist version
data. Instead of using the firmware AQ interface with a module ID, read
from the flash as a flat NVM, using ice_read_flash_module.

This change requires a slight adjustment to the offset values used, as
reading from the flat NVM includes the type field (which was stripped by
firmware previously). Cleanup the macro names and move them to
ice_type.h. For clarity in how we calculate the offsets and so that
programmers can easily map the offset value to the data sheet, use
a wrapper macro to account for the offset adjustments.

Use the newly added ice_get_inactive_netlist_ver function to extract the
version data from the pending netlist module update. Add the stored
variants of "fw.netlist", and "fw.netlist.build" to the info version map
array.

With this change, we now report the "fw.netlist" and "fw.netlist.build"
versions into the stored section of the devlink info report. As with the
main NVM module versions, if there is no pending update, we report the
currently active values as stored.
