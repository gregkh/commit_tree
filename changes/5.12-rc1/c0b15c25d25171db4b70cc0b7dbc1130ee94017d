arm64: Extend workaround for erratum 1024718 to all versions of Cortex-A55

The erratum 1024718 affects Cortex-A55 r0p0 to r2p0. However
we apply the work around for r0p0 - r1p0. Unfortunately this
won't be fixed for the future revisions for the CPU. Thus
extend the work around for all versions of A55, to cover
for r2p0 and any future revisions.
