MAINTAINERS: Fix the tree location for INTEL SGX patches

After a discussion with Boris et al, I've come to realize that a
disjoint GIT tree for SGX does not make any sense.

Instead, follow the pattern of other MAINTAINERS entries, IRQ DOMAINS for
instance, and re-define T-entry so that it will reference the pre-existing
topic branch for SGX. As Boris explained to me, reviewed patches will be
routinely picked to this branch.
