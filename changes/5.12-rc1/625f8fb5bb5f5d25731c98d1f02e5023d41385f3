drm/vmwgfx: Fix display register usage for some older configs

We can't be setting the display_id register to an invalid value
because that makes our device reset the fb which causes nasty
flicker (due to destruction and creation of a new fb).
Also we can't be using the BITS_PER_PIXEL register if the
8BIT_EMULATION is not supported.
