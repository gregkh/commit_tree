drm: rcar-du: Use DRM-managed allocation for encoders

devm_kzalloc() is the wrong API to allocate encoders, as the lifetime of
the encoders is tied to the DRM device, not the device to driver
binding. drmm_kzalloc() isn't a good option either, as it would result
in the encoder being freed before being unregistered during the managed
cleanup of the DRM objects. Use a plain kzalloc(), and register a drmm
action to cleanup the encoder.
