riscv: Update Canaan Kendryte K210 defconfig

Update the Kendryte k210 nommu default configuration file
(nommu_k210_defconfig) to include device drivers for reset, reboot,
I2C, SPI, gpio and LEDs support. Virtual Terminal support is also
disabled as no terminal devices are supported and enabled. Disabling
CONFIG_VT (removing the no longer needed override for
CONFIG_VGA_CONSOLE) reduces the kernel image size by about 65 KB.

This default configuration remains suitable for a system using an
initramfs cpio file linked into the kernel image.
