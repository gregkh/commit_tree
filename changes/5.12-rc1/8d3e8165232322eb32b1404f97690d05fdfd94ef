tracing: Update synth command errors

Since array types are handled differently, errors referencing them
also need to be handled differently.  Add and use a new
INVALID_ARRAY_SPEC error.  Also add INVALID_CMD and INVALID_DYN_CMD to
catch and display the correct form for badly-formed commands, which
can also be used in place of CMD_INCOMPLETE, which is removed, and
remove CMD_TOO_LONG, since it's no longer used.
