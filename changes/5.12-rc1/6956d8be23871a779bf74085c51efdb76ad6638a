crypto: octeontx2 - fix -Wpointer-bool-conversion warning

When CONFIG_CPUMASK_OFFSTACK is disabled, clang reports a warning
about a bogus condition:

drivers/crypto/marvell/octeontx2/otx2_cptlf.c:334:21: error: address of array 'lfs->lf[slot].affinity_mask' will always evaluate to 'true' [-Werror,-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
                if (lfs->lf[slot].affinity_mask)
                ~~  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this configuration, the free_cpumask_var() function does nothing,
so the condition could be skipped.

When the option is enabled, there is no warning, but the check
is also redundant because free_cpumask_var() falls back to kfree(),
which is documented as ignoring NULL pointers.

Remove the check to avoid the warning.
