KVM: nVMX: Disable PML in hardware when running L2

Unconditionally disable PML in vmcs02, KVM emulates PML purely in the
MMU, e.g. vmx_flush_pml_buffer() doesn't even try to copy the L2 GPAs
from vmcs02's buffer to vmcs12.  At best, enabling PML is a nop.  At
worst, it will cause vmx_flush_pml_buffer() to record bogus GFNs in the
dirty logs.

Initialize vmcs02.GUEST_PML_INDEX such that PML writes would trigger
VM-Exit if PML was somehow enabled, skip flushing the buffer for guest
mode since the index is bogus, and freak out if a PML full exit occurs
when L2 is active.
