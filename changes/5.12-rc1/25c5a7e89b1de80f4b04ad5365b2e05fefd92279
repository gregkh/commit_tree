net: ipa: initialize all resources

We configure the minimum and maximum number of various types of IPA
resources in ipa_resource_config().  It iterates over resource types
in the configuration data and assigns resource limits to each
resource group for each type.

Unfortunately, we are repeatedly initializing the resource data for
the first type, rather than initializing each of the types whose
limits are specified.

Fix this bug.
