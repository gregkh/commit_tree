media: i2c: ov5670: Fix PIXEL_RATE minimum value

The driver currently reports a single supported value for
V4L2_CID_PIXEL_RATE and initializes the control's minimum value to 0,
which is very risky, as userspace might accidentally use it as divider
when calculating the time duration of a line.

Fix this by using as minimum the only supported value when registering
the control.
