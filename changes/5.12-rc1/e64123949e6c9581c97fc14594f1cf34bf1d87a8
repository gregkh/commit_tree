Input: applespi - fix occasional crc errors under load.

For some reason, when the system is under heavy CPU load, the read
following the write sometimes occurs unusually quickly, resulting in
the read data not being quite ready and hence a bad packet getting read.
Adding another delay after reading the status message appears to fix
this.
