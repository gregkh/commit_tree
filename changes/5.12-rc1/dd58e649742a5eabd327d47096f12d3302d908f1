docs: Make syscalls' helpers naming consistent

The documentation explains the need to create internal syscalls' helpers,
and that they should be called `kern_xyzzy()`. However, the comment at
include/linux/syscalls.h says that they should be named as
`ksys_xyzzy()`, and so are all the helpers declared bellow it. Change the
documentation to reflect this.
