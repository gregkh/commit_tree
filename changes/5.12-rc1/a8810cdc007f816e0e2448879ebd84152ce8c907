ceph: allow queueing cap/snap handling after putting cap references

Testing with the fscache overhaul has triggered some lockdep warnings
about circular lock dependencies involving page_mkwrite and the
mmap_lock. It'd be better to do the "real work" without the mmap lock
being held.

Change the skip_checking_caps parameter in __ceph_put_cap_refs to an
enum, and use that to determine whether to queue check_caps, do it
synchronously or not at all. Change ceph_page_mkwrite to do a
ceph_put_cap_refs_async().
