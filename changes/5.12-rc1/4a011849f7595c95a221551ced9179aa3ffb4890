Revert "GFS2: Re-add a call to log_flush_wait when flushing the journal"

This reverts commit 428fd95d859b24fea448380fa21ad6d841b34241.
Patch 428fd95d85b2 added a call to log_flush_wait to function
gfs2_log_flush. Then gfs2_log_flush calls log_write_header which submits
a write request with the REQ_PREFLUSH flag which also forces it to wait.
This patch removes the unnecessary call to log_flush_wait.
