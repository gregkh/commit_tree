ice: create scheduler aggregator node config and move VSIs

Create set scheduler aggregator node and move for VSIs into respective
scheduler node. Max children per aggregator node is 64.

There are two types of aggregator node(s) created.
1. dedicated node for PF and _CTRL VSIs
2. dedicated node(s) for VFs.

As part of reset and rebuild, aggregator nodes are recreated and VSIs
are moved to respective aggregator node.

Having related VSIs in respective tree avoid starvation between PF and VF
w.r.t Tx bandwidth.
