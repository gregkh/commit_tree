doc: use KCFLAGS instead of EXTRA_CFLAGS to pass flags from command line

You should use KCFLAGS to pass additional compiler flags from the
command line. Using EXTRA_CFLAGS is wrong.

EXTRA_CFLAGS is supposed to specify flags applied only to the current
Makefile (and now deprecated in favor of ccflags-y).

It is still used in arch/mips/kvm/Makefile (and possibly in external
modules too). Passing EXTRA_CFLAGS from the command line overwrites
it and breaks the build.

I also fixed drivers/gpu/drm/tilcdc/Makefile because commit 816175dd1fd7
("drivers/gpu/drm/tilcdc: Makefile, only -Werror when no -W* in
EXTRA_CFLAGS") was based on the same misunderstanding.
