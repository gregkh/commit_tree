rcutorture: Add testing for RCU's global memory ordering

RCU guarantees that anything seen by a given reader will also be seen
after any grace period that must wait on that reader.  This is very likely
to hold based on inspection, but the advantage of having rcutorture do
the inspecting is that rcutorture doesn't mind inspecting frequently
and often.

This commit therefore adds code to test RCU's global memory ordering.
