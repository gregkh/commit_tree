docs: Fix typos and drop/fix dead links in RCU documentation

It appears the Compaq link moved to a machine at HP for a while
after the merger of the two, but that doesn't work either.  A search
of HP for "wiz_2637" (w and w/o html suffix) comes up empty.

Since the references aren't critical to the documents we remove them.

Also, the lkml.kernel.org/g links have been broken for ages, so replace
them with lore.kernel.org/r links - standardize on lore for all links too.

Note that we put off fixing these 4y ago - presumably thinking that a
treewide fixup was pending.  Probably safe to go fix the RCU ones now.
