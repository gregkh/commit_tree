scsi: lpfc: Fix vport create logging

When with testing with large numbers of npiv vports and link bounces, the
driver is flooding the messages file, even with log_verbose = 0.

The new LOG_TRACE_EVENT messages are still generating events to the
messages files.

Fix by converting the vport create msg from LOG_TRACE_EVENT to LOG_VPORT.
