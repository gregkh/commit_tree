soundwire: bus: clarify dev_err/dbg device references

The SoundWire bus code confuses bus and Slave device levels for
dev_err/dbg logs. That's not impacting functionality but the accuracy
of kernel logs.

We should only use bus->dev for bus-level operations and handling of
Device0. For all other logs where the device number is not zero, we
should use &slave->dev to provide more precisions to the
user/integrator.
