s390/qdio: track time of last data IRQ for each device

We currently track the time of the most recent QDIO Adapter Interrupt.
This is a system-wide timestamp (as such interrupts are not bound to
one specific qdio device).

If interrupt processing stalls on one device but is functional for a
different device, the timestamp continues to be updated and is of no
help for problem diagnosis.
So for debugging purposes also track the time of the last Data IRQ on
a per-device level. Collect this data in the legacy non-AI path as well.
