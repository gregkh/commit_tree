platform/chrome: cros_ec_typec: Skip port partner check in configure_mux()

For certain needs like updating the USB4 retimer firmware when no
device are connected, the Type-C ports require mux configuration,
to be able to communicate with the retimer. So removed the above
check to allow for mux configuration of Type-C ports, to enable
retimer communication.
