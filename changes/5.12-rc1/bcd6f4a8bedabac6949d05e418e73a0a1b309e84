bpf: Allow to retrieve sol_socket opts from sock_addr progs

The _bpf_setsockopt() is able to set some of the SOL_SOCKET level options,
however, _bpf_getsockopt() has little support to actually retrieve them.
This small patch adds few misc options such as SO_MARK, SO_PRIORITY and
SO_BINDTOIFINDEX. For the latter getter and setter are added. The mark and
priority in particular allow to retrieve the options from BPF cgroup hooks
to then implement custom behavior / settings on the syscall hooks compared
to other sockets that stick to the defaults, for example.
