media: ACPI / bus: Add acpi_dev_get_next_match_dev() and helper macro

To ensure we handle situations in which multiple sensors of the same
model (and therefore _HID) are present in a system, we need to be able
to iterate over devices matching a known _HID but unknown _UID and _HRV
 - add acpi_dev_get_next_match_dev() to accommodate that possibility and
change acpi_dev_get_first_match_dev() to simply call the new function
with a NULL starting point. Add an iterator macro for convenience.
