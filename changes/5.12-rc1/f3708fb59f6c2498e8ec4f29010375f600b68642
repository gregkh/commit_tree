gfs2: Get rid of sd_reserving_log

This counter and the associated wait queue are only used so that
gfs2_make_fs_ro can efficiently wait for all pending log space
allocations to fail after setting the filesystem to read-only.  This
comes at the cost of waking up that wait queue very frequently.

Instead, when gfs2_log_reserve fails because the filesystem has become
read-only, Wake up sd_log_waitq.  In gfs2_make_fs_ro, set the file
system read-only and then wait until all the log space has been
released.  Give up and report the problem after a while.  With that,
sd_reserving_log and sd_reserving_log_wait can be removed.
