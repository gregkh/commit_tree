scsi: scsi_transport_fc: Add store capability to rport port_state in sysfs

Add store capability to the rport port_state using sysfs under
fc_remote_ports/rport-*/port_state.

With this the user can move the port_state from Marginal->Online and
Online->Marginal.

 - Marginal: This interface will set SCMD_NORETRIES_ABORT bit in
   scmd->state for all the pending I/Os on the SCSI device associated with
   target port.

 - Online: This interface will clear SCMD_NORETRIES_ABORT bit in
   scmd->state for all the pending I/Os on the SCSI device associated with
   target port.

The following interface is provided to set the port state to Marginal and
Online respectively:

echo "Marginal" >> /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-X\:Y-Z/port_state
echo "Online" >> /sys/class/fc_remote_ports/rport-X\:Y-Z/port_state
