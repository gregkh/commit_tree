opp: Allow _generic_set_opp_clk_only() to work for non-freq devices

In order to avoid conditional statements at the caller site, this patch
updates _generic_set_opp_clk_only() to work for devices that don't
change frequency (like power domains, etc.). Return 0 if the clk pointer
passed to this routine is not valid.
