net: mscc: ocelot: offload bridge port flags to device

We should not be unconditionally enabling address learning, since doing
that is actively detrimential when a port is standalone and not offloading
a bridge. Namely, if a port in the switch is standalone and others are
offloading the bridge, then we could enter a situation where we learn an
address towards the standalone port, but the bridged ports could not
forward the packet there, because the CPU is the only path between the
standalone and the bridged ports. The solution of course is to not
enable address learning unless the bridge asks for it.

We need to set up the initial port flags for no learning and flooding
everything, and also when the port joins and leaves the bridge.
The flood configuration was already configured ok for standalone mode
in ocelot_init, we just need to disable learning in ocelot_init_port.
