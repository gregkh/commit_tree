media: ccs: Support and default to auto PHY control

CCS supports three variants of PHY timing control, auto, UI based and
manual. The driver previously assumed UI based control that requires
updating the link rate to the sensor. Now default to automatic control
instead, and only write the link rate to the sensor in UI mode.

If neither auto or UI control is supported, return an error in probe.
