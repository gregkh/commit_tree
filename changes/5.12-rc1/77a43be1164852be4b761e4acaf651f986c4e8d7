arm64: kexec: call kexec_image_info only once

Currently, kexec_image_info() is called during load time, and
right before kernel is being kexec'ed. There is no need to do both.
So, call it only once when segments are loaded and the physical
location of page with copy of arm64_relocate_new_kernel is known.
