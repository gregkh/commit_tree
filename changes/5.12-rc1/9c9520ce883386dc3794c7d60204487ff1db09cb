KVM: vmx/pmu: Add PMU_CAP_LBR_FMT check when guest LBR is enabled

Usespace could set the bits [0, 5] of the IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES
MSR which tells about the record format stored in the LBR records.

The LBR will be enabled on the guest if host perf supports LBR
(checked via x86_perf_get_lbr()) and the vcpu model is compatible
with the host one.
