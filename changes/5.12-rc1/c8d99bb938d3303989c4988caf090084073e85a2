drm/msm: Fix legacy relocs path

In moving code around, we ended up using the same pointer to
copy_from_user() the relocs tables as we used for the cmd table
entry, which is clearly not right.  This went unnoticed because
modern mesa on non-ancent kernels does not actually use relocs.
But this broke ancient mesa on modern kernels.
