mm/hugetlb: change hugetlb_reserve_pages() to type bool

While reviewing a bug in hugetlb_reserve_pages, it was noticed that all
callers ignore the return value.  Any failure is considered an ENOMEM
error by the callers.

Change the function to be of type bool.  The function will return true if
the reservation was successful, false otherwise.  Callers currently assume
a zero return code indicates success.  Change the callers to look for true
to indicate success.  No functional change, only code cleanup.
