usb: typec: tcpm: Add Callback to Usb Communication capable partner

The USB Communications Capable bit indicates if port
partner is capable of communication over the USB data lines
(e.g. D+/- or SS Tx/Rx). Notify the status of the bit to low
level drivers to perform chip specific operation.
For instance, low level driver enables USB switches on D+/D-
lines to set up data path when the bit is set.
