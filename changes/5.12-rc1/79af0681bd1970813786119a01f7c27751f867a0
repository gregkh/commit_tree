drm/amd/pm: fix one superfluous error for renoir

This patch is to fix one superfluous error for renoir.
Renoir supports 5 kinds of power profile mode:
"FULL SCREEN 3D", "VIDEO", "VR", "COMPUTE" and "CUSTOM".
After loading amdgpu driver, the driver will set "BOOTUP_DEFAULT"
mode to APU, and it will get one superfluouserror error,
which is saying "Unsupported power profile mode 0 on RENOIR",
but it will not make any other harmful events, so fix this error.
