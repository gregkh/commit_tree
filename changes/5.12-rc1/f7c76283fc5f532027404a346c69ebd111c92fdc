rtlwifi: rtl8192c-common: fix bool comparison in expressions

There are certain conditional expressions in rtl8192c-common, where a
boolean variable is compared with true/false, in forms such as
(foo == true) or (false != bar), which does not comply with checkpatch.pl
(CHECK: BOOL_COMPARISON), according to which boolean variables should be
themselves used in the condition, rather than comparing with true/false

E.g., in drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/rtl8192c/dm_common.c,
"else if (initialized == false) {" can be replaced with
"else if (!initialized) {"

Replace all such expressions with the bool variables appropriately
