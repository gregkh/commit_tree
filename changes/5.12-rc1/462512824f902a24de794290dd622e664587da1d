lan743x: fix endianness when accessing descriptors

TX/RX descriptor ring fields are always little-endian, but conversion
wasn't performed for big-endian CPUs, so the driver failed to work.

This patch makes the driver work on big-endian CPUs. It was tested and
confirmed to work on NXP P1010 processor (PowerPC).
