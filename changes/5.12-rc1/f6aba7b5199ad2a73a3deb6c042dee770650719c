net: ipa: drop packet if status has valid tag

Introduce ipa_endpoint_status_tag(), which returns true if received
status indicates its tag field is valid.  The endpoint parameter is
not yet used.

Call this from ipa_status_drop_packet(), and drop the packet if the
status indicates the tag was valid.  Pass the endpoint pointer to
ipa_status_drop_packet(), and rename it ipa_endpoint_status_drop().
The endpoint will be used in the next patch.
