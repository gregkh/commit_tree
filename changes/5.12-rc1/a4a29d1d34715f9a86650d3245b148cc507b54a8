drm/omap: dsi: rename dsi_display_* functions

The function names have evolved to be very confusing, and bunch of them
have "display" in them even if the function doesn't deal with display as
such (e.g. dsi_display_enable which just enables the DSI interface).
Rename them by dropping the "display".
