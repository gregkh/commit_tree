dt-bindings: i3c: mipi-hci: Include the bus binding

Update a little bit the content to match the bus binding, including:
- the node title should have been named after the description done
  in the historical i3c.txt file, ie: i3c-master@<address>
- child nodes should be accepted even though the drivers do not currently
  support it
- #address-cells and #size-cells are also mandatory and have specific
  values
