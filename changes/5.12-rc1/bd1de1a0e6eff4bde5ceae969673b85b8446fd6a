KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Add infrastructure to support 2nd DAWR

KVM code assumes single DAWR everywhere. Add code to support 2nd DAWR.
DAWR is a hypervisor resource and thus H_SET_MODE hcall is used to set/
unset it. Introduce new case H_SET_MODE_RESOURCE_SET_DAWR1 for 2nd DAWR.
Also, KVM will support 2nd DAWR only if CPU_FTR_DAWR1 is set.
