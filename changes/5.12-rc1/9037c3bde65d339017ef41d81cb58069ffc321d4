ASoC: SOF: debug: Fix a potential issue on string buffer termination

The function simple_write_to_buffer() doesn't add string termination
at the end of buf, we need to handle it on our own. This change refers
to the function tokenize_input() in debug.c and the function
sof_dfsentry_trace_filter_write() in trace.c.
