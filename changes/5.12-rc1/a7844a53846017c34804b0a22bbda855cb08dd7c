mac80211: minstrel_ht: add support for OFDM rates on non-HT clients

The legacy minstrel code is essentially unmaintained and receives only very
little testing. In order to bring the significant algorithm improvements from
minstrel_ht to legacy clients, this patch adds support for OFDM rates to
minstrel_ht and removes the fallback to the legacy codepath.
This also makes it work much better on hardware with rate selection constraints,
e.g. mt76.
