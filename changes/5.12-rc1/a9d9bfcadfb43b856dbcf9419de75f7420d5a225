arm64: dts: armada-3720-turris-mox: rename u-boot mtd partition to a53-firmware

The partition called "u-boot" in reality contains TF-A and U-Boot, and
TF-A is before U-Boot.

Rename this parition to "a53-firmware" to avoid confusion for users,
since they cannot simply build U-Boot from U-Boot repository and flash
the resulting image there. Instead they have to build the firmware with
the sources from the mox-boot-builder repository [1] and flash the
a53-firmware.bin binary there.
