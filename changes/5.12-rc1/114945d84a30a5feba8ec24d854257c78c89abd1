arm64: Fix labels in el2_setup macros

If someone happens to write the following code:

	b	1f
	init_el2_state	vhe
1:
	[...]

they will be in for a long debugging session, as the label "1f"
will be resolved *inside* the init_el2_state macro instead of
after it. Not really what one expects.

Instead, rewite the EL2 setup macros to use unambiguous labels,
thanks to the usual macro counter trick.
