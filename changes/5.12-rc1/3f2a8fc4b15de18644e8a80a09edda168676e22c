static_call/x86: Add __static_call_return0()

Provide a stub function that return 0 and wire up the static call site
patching to replace the CALL with a single 5 byte instruction that
clears %RAX, the return value register.

The function can be cast to any function pointer type that has a
single %RAX return (including pointers). Also provide a version that
returns an int for convenience. We are clearing the entire %RAX register
in any case, whether the return value is 32 or 64 bits, since %RAX is
always a scratch register anyway.
