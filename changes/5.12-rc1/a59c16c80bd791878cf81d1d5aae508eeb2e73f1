clk: qcom: gpucc-msm8998: Add resets, cxc, fix flags on gpu_gx_gdsc

The GPU GX GDSC has GPU_GX_BCR reset and gfx3d_clk CXC, as stated
on downstream kernels (and as verified upstream, because otherwise
random lockups happen).
Also, add PWRSTS_RET and NO_RET_PERIPH: also as found downstream,
and also as verified here, to avoid GPU related lockups it is
necessary to force retain mem, but *not* peripheral when enabling
this GDSC (and, of course, the inverse on disablement).

With this change, the GPU finally works flawlessly on my four
different MSM8998 devices from two different manufacturers.
