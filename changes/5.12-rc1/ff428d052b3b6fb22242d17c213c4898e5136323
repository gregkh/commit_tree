misc: bcm-vk: add get_card_info, peerlog_info, and proc_mon_info

Add support to get card_info (details about card),
peerlog_info (to get details of peerlog on card),
and proc_mon_info (process monitoring on card).

This info is used for collection of logs via direct
read of BAR space and by sysfs access (in a follow on commit).
