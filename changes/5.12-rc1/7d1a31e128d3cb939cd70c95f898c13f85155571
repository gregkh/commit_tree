Revert "drm/i915/lmem: Limit block size to 4G"

Mixing I915_ALLOC_CONTIGUOUS and I915_ALLOC_MAX_SEGMENT_SIZE fared
badly. The two directives conflict, with the contiguous request setting
the min_order to the full size of the object, and the max-segment-size
setting the max_order to the limit of the DMA mapper. This results in a
situation where max_order < min_order, causing our sanity checks to
fail.

Instead of limiting the buddy block size, in the previous patch we split
the oversized buddy into multiple scatterlist elements.
