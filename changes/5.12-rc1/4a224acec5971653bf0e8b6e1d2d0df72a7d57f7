fpga: dfl: add dfl bus support to MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE()

Device Feature List (DFL) is a linked list of feature headers within the
device MMIO space. It is used by FPGA to enumerate multiple sub features
within it. Each feature can be uniquely identified by DFL type and
feature id, which can be read out from feature headers.

A dfl bus helps DFL framework modularize DFL device drivers for
different sub features. The dfl bus matches its devices and drivers by
DFL type and feature id.

This patch adds dfl bus support to MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE() by adding info
about struct dfl_device_id in devicetable-offsets.c and add a dfl entry
point in file2alias.c.
