hv: hyperv.h: Replace one-element array with flexible-array in struct icmsg_negotiate

There is a regular need in the kernel to provide a way to declare having
a dynamically sized set of trailing elements in a structure. Kernel code
should always use “flexible array members”[1] for these cases. The older
style of one-element or zero-length arrays should no longer be used[2].

Refactor the code according to the use of a flexible-array member in
struct icmsg_negotiate, instead of a one-element array.

Also, this helps the ongoing efforts to enable -Warray-bounds and fix the
following warnings:

drivers/hv/channel_mgmt.c:315:23: warning: array subscript 1 is above array bounds of ‘struct ic_version[1]’ [-Warray-bounds]
drivers/hv/channel_mgmt.c:316:23: warning: array subscript 1 is above array bounds of ‘struct ic_version[1]’ [-Warray-bounds]
