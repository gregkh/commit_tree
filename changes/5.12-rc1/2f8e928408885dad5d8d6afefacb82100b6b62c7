dt-bindings: usb: convert rockchip,dwc3.txt to yaml

In the past Rockchip dwc3 usb nodes were manually checked.
With the conversion of snps,dwc3.yaml as common document
we now can convert rockchip,dwc3.txt to yaml as well.
Remove node wrapper.

Added properties for rk3399 are:
  power-domains
  resets
  reset-names
