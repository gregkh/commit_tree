ALSA: hda/hdmi: Drop bogus check at closing a stream

Some users reported the kernel WARNING with stack traces from
hdmi_pcm_close(), and it's the line checking the per_cvt->assigned
flag.  This used to be a valid check in the past because the flag was
turned on/off only at opening and closing a PCM stream.  Meanwhile,
since the introduction of the silent-stream mode, this flag may be
turned on/off at the monitor connection/disconnection time, which
isn't always associated with the PCM open/close.  Hence this may lead
to the inconsistent per_cvt->assigned flag at closing.

As the check itself became almost useless and confuses users as if it
were a serious problem, just drop the check.
