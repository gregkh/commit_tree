block: memory allocations in bounce_clone_bio must not fail

The caller can't cope with a failure from bounce_clone_bio, so
use __GFP_NOFAIL for the passthrough case.  bio_alloc_bioset already
won't fail due to the use of mempools.

And yes, we need to get rid of this bock layer bouncing code entirely
sooner or later..
