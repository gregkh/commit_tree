xhci: add xhci_virt_ep_to_ring() helper

Two existing ring helpers, xhci_triad_to_transfer_ring() and
xhci_stream_id_to_ring() have partially similar functionality.
Both have some limitation, especieally with boundary checking.

Add a new xhci_virt_ep_to_ring() helper with proper boundary checking
that can replace parts of one helper, and later will completely
replace the other helper.
