btrfs: zoned: use bio_add_zone_append_page

A zoned device has its own hardware restrictions e.g. max_zone_append_size
when using REQ_OP_ZONE_APPEND. To follow these restrictions, use
bio_add_zone_append_page() instead of bio_add_page(). We need target device
to use bio_add_zone_append_page(), so this commit reads the chunk
information to cache the target device to btrfs_io_bio(bio)->device.

Caching only the target device is sufficient here as zoned filesystems
only supports the single profile at the moment. Once more profiles will be
supported btrfs_io_bio can hold an extent_map to be able to check for the
restrictions of all devices the btrfs_bio will be mapped to.
