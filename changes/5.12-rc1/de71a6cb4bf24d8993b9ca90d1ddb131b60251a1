Bluetooth: btusb: Fix memory leak in btusb_mtk_wmt_recv

In btusb_mtk_wmt_recv if skb_clone fails, the alocated skb should be
released.

Omit the labels “err_out” and “err_free_skb” in this function
implementation so that the desired exception handling code
would be directly specified in the affected if branches.
