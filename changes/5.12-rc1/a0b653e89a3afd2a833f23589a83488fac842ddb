ASoC: wm_adsp: Only use __be32 for big-endian data

This fixes some minor cases where u32 or unsigned int types were used
to store big-endian data, and __be32 types used to store both big-endian
and cpu-endian data. This was producing sparse warnings.

Most cases resulted from using the same variable to hold the big-endian
value and its converted cpu-endian value. These can be simply fixed by
introducing another local variable, or avoiding storing the intermediate
value back into the original variable.

One special case is the raw_buf used in the compressed streams to transfer
data from DSP to user-side. The endian conversion happens in-place (as
there's no point introducing another buffer) so a cast to (__be32 *) is
added when passing it to wm_adsp_read_raw_data_block().
