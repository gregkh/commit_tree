drm/i915: Drop i915_request.lock requirement for intel_rps_boost()

Since we use a flag within i915_request.flags to indicate when we have
boosted the request (so that we only apply the boost) once, this can be
used as the serialisation with i915_request_retire() to avoid having to
explicitly take the i915_request.lock which is more heavily contended.
