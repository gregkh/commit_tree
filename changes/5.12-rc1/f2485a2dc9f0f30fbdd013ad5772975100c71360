elf_prstatus: collect the common part (everything before pr_reg) into a struct

Preparations to doing i386 compat elf_prstatus sanely - rather than duplicating
the beginning of compat_elf_prstatus, take these fields into a separate
structure (compat_elf_prstatus_common), so that it could be reused.  Due to
the incestous relationship between binfmt_elf.c and compat_binfmt_elf.c we
need the same shape change done to native struct elf_prstatus, gathering the
fields prior to pr_reg into a new structure (struct elf_prstatus_common).

Fortunately, offset of pr_reg is always a multiple of 16 with no padding
right before it, so it's possible to turn all the stuff prior to it into
a single member without disturbing the layout.

[build fix from Geert Uytterhoeven folded in]
