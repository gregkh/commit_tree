net/mlx5e: Change interrupt moderation channel params also when channels are closed

struct mlx5e_params contains fields ({rx,tx}_cq_moderation) that depend
on two things: whether DIM is enabled and the state of a private flag
(MLX5E_PFLAG_{RX,TX}_CQE_BASED_MODER). Whenever the DIM state changes,
mlx5e_reset_{rx,tx}_moderation is called to update the fields, however,
only if the channels are open. The flow where the channels are closed
misses the required update of the fields. This commit moves the calls of
mlx5e_reset_{rx,tx}_moderation, so that they run in both flows.
