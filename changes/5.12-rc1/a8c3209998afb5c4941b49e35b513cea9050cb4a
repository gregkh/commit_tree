Drivers: hv: vmbus: Copy packets sent by Hyper-V out of the ring buffer

Pointers to ring-buffer packets sent by Hyper-V are used within the
guest VM. Hyper-V can send packets with erroneous values or modify
packet fields after they are processed by the guest. To defend
against these scenarios, return a copy of the incoming VMBus packet
after validating its length and offset fields in hv_pkt_iter_first().
In this way, the packet can no longer be modified by the host.
