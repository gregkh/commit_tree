ARM: dts: meson8: add the thermal-zones with cooling configuration

The vendor kernel uses the following thermal-zone settings:
<= 70°C:
- CPU frequency limited to 1.608GHz
- GPU limited to 511MHz and 5 cores (pixel processors)

<= 80°C:
- CPU frequency limited to 1.2GHz
- GPU limited to 435MHz and 4 cores (pixel processors)

<= 90°C:
- CPU frequency limited to 0.804GHz
- GPU limited to 328MHz and 3 cores (pixel processors)

Add simplified thermal configuration which is taken from the
GXBB/GXL/GXM SoC family (which uses the same manufacturing process and
has the same maximum junction temperature of 125°C). With this the
thermal framework will try to keep the SoC temperature at or below 80°C
which is identical to the vendor kernel (with the exception of one GPU
pixel processor).

The number of GPU cores are not taken into account as this is not
supported.
