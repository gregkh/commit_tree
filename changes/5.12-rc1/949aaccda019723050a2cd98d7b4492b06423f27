HID: playstation: add DualSense player LED support.

The DualSense features 5 player LEDs below its touchpad, which are
meant as player id indications. The LEDs are configured with a
player ID determined by an ID allocator, which assign player ids
to ps_device instances.

This patch is a combination of the following original patches
minus use of LED framework APIs:
- HID: playstation: add DualSense player LEDs support.
- HID: playstation: DualSense set LEDs to default player id.
