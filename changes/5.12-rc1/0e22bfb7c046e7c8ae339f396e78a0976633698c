net/mlx5e: E-switch, Fix rate calculation for overflow

rate_bytes_ps is a 64-bit field. It passed as 32-bit field to
apply_police_params(). Due to this when police rate is higher
than 4Gbps, 32-bit calculation ignores the carry. This results
in incorrect rate configurationn the device.

Fix it by performing 64-bit calculation.
