bpf: Allows per-cpu maps and map-in-map in sleepable programs

Since sleepable programs are now executing under migrate_disable
the per-cpu maps are safe to use.
The map-in-map were ok to use in sleepable from the time sleepable
progs were introduced.

Note that non-preallocated maps are still not safe, since there is
no rcu_read_lock yet in sleepable programs and dynamically allocated
map elements are relying on rcu protection. The sleepable programs
have rcu_read_lock_trace instead. That limitation will be addresses
in the future.
