mfd: arizona: Replace arizona_of_get_type() with device_get_match_data()

Replace the custom arizona_of_get_type() function with the generic
device_get_match_data() helper. Besides being a nice cleanup this
also makes it easier to add support for binding to ACPI enumerated
devices.

While at it also fix a possible NULL pointer deref of the id
argument to the probe functions (this could happen on e.g. manual
driver binding through sysfs).
