torture: Maintain torture-specific set of CPUs-online books

The TREE01 rcutorture scenario intentionally creates confusion as to the
number of available CPUs by specifying the "maxcpus=8 nr_cpus=43" kernel
boot parameters.  This can disable rcutorture's load shedding, which
currently uses num_online_cpus(), which would count the extra 35 CPUs.
However, the rcutorture guest OS will be provisioned with only 8 CPUs,
which means that rcutorture will present full load even when all but one
of the original 8 CPUs are offline.  This can result in spurious errors
due to extreme overloading of that single remaining CPU.

This commit therefore keeps a separate set of books on the number of
usable online CPUs, so that torture_num_online_cpus() is used for load
shedding instead of num_online_cpus().  Note that initial sizing must
use num_online_cpus() because torture_num_online_cpus() will return
NR_CPUS until shortly after torture_onoff_init() is invoked.
