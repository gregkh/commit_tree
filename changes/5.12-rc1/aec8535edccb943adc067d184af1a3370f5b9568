soc: qcom: socinfo: Remove unwanted le32_to_cpu()

Remove extra le32_to_cpu() conversion, data is already converted from
le32 to cpu endianness. This fixes two following warnings:

drivers/soc/qcom/socinfo.c:322:36: sparse: sparse: cast to restricted __le32
drivers/soc/qcom/socinfo.c:323:36: sparse: sparse: cast to restricted __le32
