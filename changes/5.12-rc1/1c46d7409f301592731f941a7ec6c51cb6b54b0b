net/mlx5e: Optimize promiscuous mode

Change steering flow to optimize traffic in promiscuous mode. On demand,
add a high priority table containing a catch-all rule. All incoming
packets are caught by this rule and steered directly to the TTC table.
Prior to this change, packets in promiscuous mode may suffer from up to
4 steering hops before reaching TTC table.
In addition, this patch will allow us adding a catch-all rule at the end
of MAC table to serve MAC trap, with no impact on promiscuous mode
performance.
