perf/x86/rapl: Add msr mask support

In some cases, when probing a perf MSR, we're probing certain bits of the
MSR instead of the whole register, thus only these bits should be checked.

For example, for RAPL ENERGY_STATUS MSR, only the lower 32 bits represents
the energy counter, and the higher 32bits are reserved.

Introduce a new mask field in struct perf_msr to allow probing certain
bits of a MSR.

This change is transparent to the current perf_msr_probe() users.
