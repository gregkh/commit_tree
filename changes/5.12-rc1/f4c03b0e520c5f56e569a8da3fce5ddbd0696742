powerpc/64s: move bad_page_fault handling to C

This simplifies code, and it is also useful when introducing
interrupt handler wrappers when introducing wrapper functionality
that doesn't cope with asm entry code calling into more than one
handler function.

32-bit and 64e still have some such cases, which limits some ways
they can use interrupt wrappers.
