driver core: Set fw_devlink=on by default

Cyclic dependencies in some firmware was one of the last remaining
reasons fw_devlink=on couldn't be set by default. Now that cyclic
dependencies don't block probing, set fw_devlink=on by default.

Setting fw_devlink=on by default brings a bunch of benefits (currently,
only for systems with device tree firmware):
* Significantly cuts down deferred probes.
* Device probe is effectively attempted in graph order.
* Makes it much easier to load drivers as modules without having to
  worry about functional dependencies between modules (depmod is still
  needed for symbol dependencies).

If this patch prevents some devices from probing, it's very likely due
to the system having one or more device drivers that "probe"/set up a
device (DT node with compatible property) without creating a struct
device for it.  If we hit such cases, the device drivers need to be
fixed so that they populate struct devices and probe them like normal
device drivers so that the driver core is aware of the devices and their
status. See [1] for an example of such a case.
