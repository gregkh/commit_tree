bfq: Avoid false bfq queue merging

bfq_setup_cooperator() uses bfqd->in_serv_last_pos so detect whether it
makes sense to merge current bfq queue with the in-service queue.
However if the in-service queue is freshly scheduled and didn't dispatch
any requests yet, bfqd->in_serv_last_pos is stale and contains value
from the previously scheduled bfq queue which can thus result in a bogus
decision that the two queues should be merged. This bug can be observed
for example with the following fio jobfile:

[global]
direct=0
ioengine=sync
invalidate=1
size=1g
rw=read

[reader]
numjobs=4
directory=/mnt

where the 4 processes will end up in the one shared bfq queue although
they do IO to physically very distant files (for some reason I was able to
observe this only with slice_idle=1ms setting).

Fix the problem by invalidating bfqd->in_serv_last_pos when switching
in-service queue.
