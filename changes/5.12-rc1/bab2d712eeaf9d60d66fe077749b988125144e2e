PM: domains: Mark fwnodes when their powerdomain is added/removed

This allows fw_devlink to recognize power domain drivers that don't use
the device-driver model to initialize the device. fw_devlink will use
this information to make sure consumers of such power domain aren't
indefinitely blocked from probing, waiting for the power domain device
to appear and bind to a driver.
