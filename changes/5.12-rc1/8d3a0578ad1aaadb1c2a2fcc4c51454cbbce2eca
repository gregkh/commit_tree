usb: typec: tcpm: Respond Wait if VDM state machine is running

Port partner could send PR_SWAP/DR_SWAP/VCONN_SWAP/Request just after it
enters Ready states. This will cause conficts if the port is going to
send DISC_IDENT in the Ready states of TCPM. Set a flag indicating that
the state machine is processing VDM and respond Wait messages until the
VDM state machine stops.
