skbuff: add flags to ubuf_info for ubuf setup

Currently, when an ubuf is attached to a new skb, the shared
flags word is initialized to a fixed value.  Instead of doing
this, set the default flags in the ubuf, and have new skbs
inherit from this default.

This is needed when setting up different zerocopy types.
