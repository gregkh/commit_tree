net: tracepoint: exposing sk_family in all tcp:tracepoints

Similar to sock:inet_sock_set_state tracepoint, expose sk_family to
distinguish AF_INET and AF_INET6 families.

The following tcp tracepoints are updated:
tcp:tcp_destroy_sock
tcp:tcp_rcv_space_adjust
tcp:tcp_retransmit_skb
tcp:tcp_send_reset
tcp:tcp_receive_reset
tcp:tcp_retransmit_synack
tcp:tcp_probe
