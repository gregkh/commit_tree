net: dsa: add ops for devlink-sb

Switches that care about QoS might have hardware support for reserving
buffer pools for individual ports or traffic classes, and configuring
their sizes and thresholds. Through devlink-sb (shared buffers), this is
all configurable, as well as their occupancy being viewable.

Add the plumbing in DSA for these operations.

Individual drivers still need to call devlink_sb_register() with the
shared buffers they want to expose. A helper was not created in DSA for
this purpose (unlike, say, dsa_devlink_params_register), since in my
opinion it does not bring any benefit over plainly calling
devlink_sb_register() directly.
