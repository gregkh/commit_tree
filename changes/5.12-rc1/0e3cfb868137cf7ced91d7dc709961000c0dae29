arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-main: Fix supported max outbound regions

Cadence IP in J721E supports a maximum of 32 outbound regions. However
commit 4e5833884f66 ("arm64: dts: ti: k3-j721e-main: Add PCIe device
tree nodes") incorrectly added this as 16 outbound regions. Now that
"cdns,max-outbound-regions" is an optional property with default value
as 32, remove "cdns,max-outbound-regions" from endpoint DT node.
(Since this doesn't impact existing functionality, it need not be
backported to older kernels).
