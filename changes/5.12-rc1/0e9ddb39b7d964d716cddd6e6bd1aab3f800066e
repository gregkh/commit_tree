io_uring: cleanup up cancel SQPOLL reqs across exec

For SQPOLL rings tctx_inflight() always returns zero, so it might skip
doing full cancelation. It's fine because we jam all sqpoll submissions
in any case and do go through files cancel for them, but not nice.

Do the intended full cancellation, by mimicking __io_uring_task_cancel()
waiting but impersonating SQPOLL task.
