mmc: mediatek: fix race condition between msdc_request_timeout and irq

when get request SW timeout, if CMD/DAT xfer done irq coming right now,
then there is race between the msdc_request_timeout work and irq handler,
and the host->cmd and host->data may set to NULL in irq handler. also,
current flow ensure that only one path can go to msdc_request_done(), so
no need check the return value of cancel_delayed_work().
