virt_wifi: fix deadlock on RTNL

Fix a regression where everything in virt_wifi would just hang. This
happened due to overlapping changes between commit a05829a7222e
("cfg80211: avoid holding the RTNL when calling the driver") which
had originally needed to change the locking, but then I introduced
commit 2fe8ef106238 ("cfg80211: change netdev registration/unregistration
semantics") instead. virt_wifi somehow fell through the cracks when
I undid all the previous locking changes. Fix it now.
