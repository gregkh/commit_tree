tools api fs: Prefer cgroup v1 path in cgroupfs_find_mountpoint()

The cgroupfs_find_mountpoint() looks up the /proc/mounts file to find
a directory for the given cgroup subsystem.  It keeps both cgroup v1
and v2 path since there's a possibility of the mixed hierarchly.

But we can simply use v1 path if it's found as it will override the v2
hierarchy.
