xfs: Check for extent overflow when moving extent from cow to data fork

Moving an extent to data fork can cause a sub-interval of an existing
extent to be unmapped. This will increase extent count by 1. Mapping in
the new extent can increase the extent count by 1 again i.e.
 | Old extent | New extent | Old extent |
Hence number of extents increases by 2.
