habanalabs: support non power-of-2 DRAM phys page sizes

DRAM physical page sizes depend of the amount of HBMs available in
the device. this number is device-dependent and may also be subject
to binning when one or more of the DRAM controllers are found to
to be faulty. Such a configuration may lead to partitioning the DRAM
to non-power-of-2 pages.

To support this feature we also need to add infrastructure of address
scarmbling.
