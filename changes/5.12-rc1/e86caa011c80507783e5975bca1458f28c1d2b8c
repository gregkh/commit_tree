ASoC: tegra: SND_SOC_TEGRA_AUDIO_GRAPH_CARD should depend on SND_SOC_TEGRA

Audio Graph Card based Tegra driver is only useful on NVIDIA Tegra SoCs.
Hence add a dependency on SND_SOC_TEGRA, to prevent asking the user
about this driver when configuring a kernel without Tegra sound support.

Wrap all Tegra sound config options inside a big if/endif block, instead
of just adding the dependency to the single config option that does not
have it yet, to preventing similar future mistakes.
