selftests: netdevsim: Test route offload failure notifications

Add cases to verify that when debugfs variable "fail_route_offload" is
set, notification with "rt_offload_failed" flag is received.

Extend the existing cases to verify that when sysctl
"fib_notify_on_flag_change" is set to 2, the kernel emits notifications
only for failed route installation.

$ ./fib_notifications.sh
