x86/fault: Fold mm_fault_error() into do_user_addr_fault()

mm_fault_error() is logically just the end of do_user_addr_fault().
Combine the functions.  This makes the code easier to read.

Most of the churn here is from renaming hw_error_code to error_code in
do_user_addr_fault().

This makes no difference at all to the generated code (objdump -dr) as
compared to changing noinline to __always_inline in the definition of
mm_fault_error().
