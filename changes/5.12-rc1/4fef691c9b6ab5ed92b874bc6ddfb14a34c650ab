net: ipa: disable interrupt and NAPI after channel stop

Disable both the I/O completion interrupt and NAPI polling on a
channel *after* we successfully stop it rather than before.  This
ensures a completion occurring just before the channel is stopped
gets processed.

Enable NAPI polling and the interrupt *before* starting a channel
rather than after, to be symmetric.  A stopped channel won't
generate any completion interrupts anyway.

Enable NAPI before the interrupt and disable it afterward.
