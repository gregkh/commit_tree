skbuff: remove __kfree_skb_flush()

This function isn't much needed as NAPI skb queue gets bulk-freed
anyway when there's no more room, and even may reduce the efficiency
of bulk operations.
It will be even less needed after reusing skb cache on allocation path,
so remove it and this way lighten network softirqs a bit.
