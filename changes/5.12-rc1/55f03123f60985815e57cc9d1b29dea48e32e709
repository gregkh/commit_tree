s390/smp: implement arch_irq_work_raise()

The immediate need to have this is to have bpf_send_signal() send the
signal ASAP instead of during the next hrtimer interrupt. However, it
should also improve irq_work_queue() latencies in general, as well as
get s390 out of the lame architectures list [1].
