mfd: altera-sysmgr: Fix physical address storing more

A recent fix improved the way the resource gets passed to
the low-level accessors, but left one warning that appears
in configurations with a resource_size_t that is wider than
a pointer:

In file included from drivers/mfd/altera-sysmgr.c:19:
drivers/mfd/altera-sysmgr.c: In function 'sysmgr_probe':
drivers/mfd/altera-sysmgr.c:148:40: error: cast to pointer from integer of different size [-Werror=int-to-pointer-cast]

      |                                        ^

  148 |   regmap = devm_regmap_init(dev, NULL, (void *)res->start,
      |            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I had tried a different approach that would store the address
in the private data as a phys_addr_t, but the easiest solution
now seems to be to add a double cast to shut up the warning.

As the address is passed to an inline assembly, it is guaranteed
to not be wider than a register anyway.
