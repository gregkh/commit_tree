mptcp: always graft subflow socket to parent

Currently, incoming subflows link to the parent socket,
while outgoing ones link to a per subflow socket. The latter
is not really needed, except at the initial connect() time and
for the first subflow.

Always graft the outgoing subflow to the parent socket and
free the unneeded ones early.

This allows some code cleanup, reduces the amount of memory
used and will simplify the next patch
