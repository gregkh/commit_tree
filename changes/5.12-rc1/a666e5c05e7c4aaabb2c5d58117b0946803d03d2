dm: fix deadlock when swapping to encrypted device

The system would deadlock when swapping to a dm-crypt device. The reason
is that for each incoming write bio, dm-crypt allocates memory that holds
encrypted data. These excessive allocations exhaust all the memory and the
result is either deadlock or OOM trigger.

This patch limits the number of in-flight swap bios, so that the memory
consumed by dm-crypt is limited. The limit is enforced if the target set
the "limit_swap_bios" variable and if the bio has REQ_SWAP set.

Non-swap bios are not affected becuase taking the semaphore would cause
performance degradation.

This is similar to request-based drivers - they will also block when the
number of requests is over the limit.
