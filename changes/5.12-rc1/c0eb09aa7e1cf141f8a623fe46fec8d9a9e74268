mac80211: minstrel_ht: remove sample rate switching code for constrained devices

This was added to mitigate the effects of too much sampling on devices that
use a static global fallback table instead of configurable multi-rate retry.
Now that the sampling algorithm is improved, this code path no longer performs
any better than the standard probing on affected devices.
