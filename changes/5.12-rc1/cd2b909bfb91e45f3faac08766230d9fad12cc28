mfd: sgi-ioc3: Turn Kconfig option into a bool

Module builds of ioc3 fail with following errors:

ERROR: "spurious_interrupt" [drivers/mfd/ioc3.ko] undefined!
ERROR: "pci_find_host_bridge" [drivers/mfd/ioc3.ko] undefined!

Exporting pci_find_host_bridge got rejected by maintainer, so easiest
fix is to disable module building, which even makes sense since both
SGI Origin and Octane always contain at least one IOC3 chip.
