platform/x86: ideapad-laptop: change 'status' debugfs file format

Remove conservation mode reporting since it is already reported via
the appropriate device attribute, and its state can be deduced from
the value of GBMD. Add the return value of the GBMD and HALS ACPI
methods to the output. Use seq_puts() where possible.
