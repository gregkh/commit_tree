tcp: add TTL to SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS

This patch adds TCP_NLA_TTL to SCM_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_STATS that exports
the time-to-live or hop limit of the latest incoming packet with
SCM_TSTAMP_ACK. The value exported may not be from the packet that acks
the sequence when incoming packets are aggregated. Exporting the
time-to-live or hop limit value of incoming packets helps to estimate
the hop count of the path of the flow that may change over time.
