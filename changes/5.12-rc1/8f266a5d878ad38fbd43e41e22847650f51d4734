arm64: cpufeature: Add global feature override facility

Add a facility to globally override a feature, no matter what
the HW says. Yes, this sounds dangerous, but we do respect the
"safe" value for a given feature. This doesn't mean the user
doesn't need to know what they are doing.

Nothing uses this yet, so we are pretty safe. For now.
