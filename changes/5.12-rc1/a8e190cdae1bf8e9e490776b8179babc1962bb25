KVM: arm64: Implement the TRNG hypervisor call

Provide a hypervisor implementation of the ARM architected TRNG firmware
interface described in ARM spec DEN0098. All function IDs are implemented,
including both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the TRNG_RND service, which
is the centerpiece of the API.

The API is backed by the kernel's entropy pool only, to avoid guests
draining more precious direct entropy sources.
