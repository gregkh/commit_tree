drm: rcar-du: Fix PM reference leak in rcar_cmm_enable()

pm_runtime_get_sync will increment pm usage counter even it failed.
Forgetting to putting operation will result in a reference leak here.

A new function pm_runtime_resume_and_get is introduced in [0] to keep
usage counter balanced. So We fix the reference leak by replacing it
with new funtion.
