Revert "drm/amd/display: Tune min clk values for MPO for RV"

This reverts commit 57eeaf47a613c67d0380cf0afad73d8f52df2670.
Original issue of flash line when MPO enabled on idle screen
was fixed by raising clocks. This had negative effect of extra
power being drained. With the upstream commit 9d03bb102028
("drm/amd/display: disable dcn10 pipe split by default")
flash line issue was fixed and had positive effect for
battery life. Hence this patch is no more required.
