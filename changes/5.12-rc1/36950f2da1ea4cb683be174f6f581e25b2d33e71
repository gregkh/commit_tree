driver core: add a min_align_mask field to struct device_dma_parameters

Some devices rely on the address offset in a page to function
correctly (NVMe driver as an example). These devices may use
a different page size than the Linux kernel. The address offset
has to be preserved upon mapping, and in order to do so, we
need to record the page_offset_mask first.
