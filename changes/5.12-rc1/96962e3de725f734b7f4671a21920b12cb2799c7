drm: require each CRTC to have a unique primary plane

User-space expects to be able to pick a primary plane for each CRTC
exposed by the driver. Make sure this assumption holds in
drm_mode_config_validate.

Use the legacy drm_crtc.primary field to check this, because it's
simpler and we require drivers to set it anyways. Accumulate a set of
primary planes which are already used for a CRTC in a bitmask. Error out
if a primary plane is re-used.

v2: new patch

v3:
- Use u64 instead of __u64 (Jani)
- Use `unsigned int` instead of `unsigned` (Jani)

v4:
- Use u32 instead of u64 for plane mask (Ville)
- Use drm_plane_mask instead of BIT (Ville)
- Fix typos (Ville)
