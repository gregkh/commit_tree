csky: Add memory layout 2.5G(user):1.5G(kernel)

There are two ways for translating va to pa for csky:
 - Use TLB(Translate Lookup Buffer) and PTW (Page Table Walk)
 - Use SSEG0/1 (Simple Segment Mapping)

We use tlb mapping 0-2G and 3G-4G virtual address area and SSEG0/1
are for 2G-2.5G and 2.5G-3G translation. We could disable SSEG0
to use 2G-2.5G as TLB user mapping.
