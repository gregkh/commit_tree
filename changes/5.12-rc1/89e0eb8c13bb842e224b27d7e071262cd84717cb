xfs: restore speculative_cow_prealloc_lifetime sysctl

In commit 9669f51de5c0 I tried to get rid of the undocumented cow gc
lifetime knob.  The knob's function was never documented and it now
doesn't really have a function since eof and cow gc have been
consolidated.

Regrettably, xfs/231 relies on it and regresses on for-next.  I did not
succeed at getting far enough through fstests patch review for the fixup
to land in time.

Restore the sysctl knob, document what it did (does?), put it on the
deprecation schedule, and rip out a redundant function.
