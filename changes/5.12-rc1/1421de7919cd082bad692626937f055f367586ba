cpupower: Remove unused pscur variable.

The pscur variable is set but not uused, just remove it.

This may have previsously been set to validate the MSR_AMD_PSTATE_STATUS
MSR. With the addition of the CPUPOWER_CAP_AMD_HW_PSTATE cap flag this
is no longer needed since the cpuid bit to enable this cap flag also
validates that the MSR_AMD_PSTATE_STATUS MSR is present.
