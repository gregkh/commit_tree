microblaze: do not select TRACING_SUPPORT directly

Microblaze is the only architecture that selects TRACING_SUPPORT.

In my understanding, it is computed by kernel/trace/Kconfig:

  config TRACING_SUPPORT
          bool
          depends on TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT
          depends on STACKTRACE_SUPPORT
          default y

Microblaze enables both TRACE_IRQFLAGS_SUPPORT and STACKTRACE_SUPPORT,
so there is no change in the resulted configuration.
