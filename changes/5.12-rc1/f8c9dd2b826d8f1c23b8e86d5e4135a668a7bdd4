media: dt-bindings: tegra: Update csi data-lanes to maximum 8 lanes

Tegra VI/CSI hardware don't have native 8 lane CSI RX port.

But x8 capture can be supported by using consecutive x4 ports
simultaneously with HDMI-to-CSI bridges where source image is split
on to two x4 ports.

This patch updates dt-bindings for csi endpoint data-lane property
with maximum of 8 lanes.
