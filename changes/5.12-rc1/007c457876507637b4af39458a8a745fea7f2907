drm/i915/guc: stop calling execlists_set_default_submission

Initialize all required entries from guc_set_default_submission, instead
of calling the execlists function. The previously inherited setup has
been copied over from the execlist code and simplified by removing the
execlists submission-specific parts.

v2: move setting of relative_mmio flag to engine_setup_common (Chris)
