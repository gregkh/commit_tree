xfs: Check for extent overflow when remapping an extent

Remapping an extent involves unmapping the existing extent and mapping
in the new extent. When unmapping, an extent containing the entire unmap
range can be split into two extents,
i.e. | Old extent | hole | Old extent |
Hence extent count increases by 1.

Mapping in the new extent into the destination file can increase the
extent count by 1.
