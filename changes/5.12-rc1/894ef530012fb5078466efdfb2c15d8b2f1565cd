MIPS: properly stop .eh_frame generation

Commit 866b6a89c6d1 ("MIPS: Add DWARF unwinding to assembly") added
-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables to KBUILD_CFLAGS to prevent compiler
from emitting .eh_frame symbols.
However, as MIPS heavily uses CFI, that's not enough. Use the
approach taken for x86 (as it also uses CFI) and explicitly put CFI
symbols into the .debug_frame section (except for VDSO).
This allows us to drop .eh_frame from DISCARDS as it's no longer
being generated.
