preempt/dynamic: Provide cond_resched() and might_resched() static calls

Provide static calls to control cond_resched() (called in !CONFIG_PREEMPT)
and might_resched() (called in CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY) to that we
can override their behaviour when preempt= is overriden.

Since the default behaviour is full preemption, both their calls are
ignored when preempt= isn't passed.

  [fweisbec: branch might_resched() directly to __cond_resched(), only
             define static calls when PREEMPT_DYNAMIC]
