cifs: fix DFS failover

In do_dfs_failover(), the mount_get_conns() function requires the full
fs context in order to get new connection to server, so clone the
original context and change it accordingly when retrying the DFS
targets in the referral.

If failover was successful, then update original context with the new
UNC, prefix path and ip address.
