KVM: VMX: read/write MSR_IA32_DEBUGCTLMSR from GUEST_IA32_DEBUGCTL

SVM already has specific handlers of MSR_IA32_DEBUGCTLMSR in the
svm_get/set_msr, so the x86 common part can be safely moved to VMX.
This allows KVM to store the bits it supports in GUEST_IA32_DEBUGCTL.

Add vmx_supported_debugctl() to refactor the throwing logic of #GP.
