dmaegine: dw-axi-dmac: Support device_prep_dma_cyclic()

Add support for device_prep_dma_cyclic() callback function to benefit
DMA cyclic client, for example ALSA.

Existing AxiDMA driver only support data transfer between memory to memory.
Data transfer between device to memory and memory to device in cyclic mode
would failed if this interface is not supported by the AxiDMA driver.
