driver core: lift dma_default_coherent into common code

Lift the dma_default_coherent variable from the mips architecture code
to the driver core.  This allows an architecture to sdefault all device
to be DMA coherent at run time, even if the kernel is build with support
for DMA noncoherent device.  By allowing device_initialize to set the
->dma_coherent field to this default the amount of arch hooks required
for this behavior can be greatly reduced.
