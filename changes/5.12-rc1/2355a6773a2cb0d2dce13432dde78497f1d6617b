cxgb4/chtls/cxgbit: Keeping the max ofld immediate data size same in cxgb4 and ulds

The Max imm data size in cxgb4 is not similar to the max imm data size
in the chtls. This caused an mismatch in output of is_ofld_imm() of
cxgb4 and chtls. So fixed this by keeping the max wreq size of imm data
same in both chtls and cxgb4 as MAX_IMM_OFLD_TX_DATA_WR_LEN.

As cxgb4's max imm. data value for ofld packets is changed to
MAX_IMM_OFLD_TX_DATA_WR_LEN. Using the same in cxgbit also.
