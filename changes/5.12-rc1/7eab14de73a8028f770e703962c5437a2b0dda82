mdio, phy: fix -Wshadow warnings triggered by nested container_of()

container_of() macro hides a local variable '__mptr' inside. This
becomes a problem when several container_of() are nested in each
other within single line or plain macros.
As C preprocessor doesn't support generating random variable names,
the sole solution is to avoid defining macros that consist only of
container_of() calls, or they will self-shadow '__mptr' each time:

As they are declared in header files, these warnings are highly
repetitive and very annoying (along with the one from linux/pci.h).

Convert the related macros from linux/{mdio,phy}.h to static inlines
to avoid self-shadowing and potentially improve bug-catching.
No functional changes implied.
