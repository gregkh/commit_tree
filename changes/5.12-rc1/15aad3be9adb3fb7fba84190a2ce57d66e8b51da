KVM: X86: Reset the vcpu->run->flags at the beginning of vcpu_run

Reset the vcpu->run->flags at the beginning of kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl_run.
It can avoid every thunk of code that needs to set the flag clear it,
which increases the odds of missing a case and ending up with a flag in
an undefined state.
