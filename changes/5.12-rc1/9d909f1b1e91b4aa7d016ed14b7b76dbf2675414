i3c/master/mipi-i3c-hci: Specify HAS_IOMEM dependency

The MIPI i3c HCI driver makes use of IOMEM functions like
devm_platform_ioremap_resource(), which are only available if
CONFIG_HAS_IOMEM is defined.

This causes the driver to be enabled under make ARCH=um allyesconfig,
even though it won't build.

By adding a dependency on HAS_IOMEM, the driver will not be enabled on
architectures which don't support it.
