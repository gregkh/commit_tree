drm/doc: re-format drm.h file comment

Our documentation build system chokes on \file comments:

    ./include/uapi/drm/drm.h:2: warning: Cannot understand  * \file drm.h
     on line 2 - I thought it was a doc line

Remove all of the slash-directives, and demote to a normal comment. Keep
the historical information because it predates Git.

v3: keep the comment (Daniel)
