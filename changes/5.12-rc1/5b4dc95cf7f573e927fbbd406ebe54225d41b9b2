drm/i915/gt: Prevent use of engine->wa_ctx after error

On error we unpin and free the wa_ctx.vma, but do not clear any of the
derived flags. During lrc_init, we look at the flags and attempt to
dereference the wa_ctx.vma if they are set. To protect the error path
where we try to limp along without the wa_ctx, make sure we clear those
flags!
