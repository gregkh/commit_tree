net: ipa: don't pass size to ipa_cmd_transfer_add()

The only time we transfer data (rather than issuing a command) out
of the AP->command TX endpoint is when we're clearing the hardware
pipeline.  All that's needed is a "small" data buffer, and its
contents aren't even important.

For convenience, we just transfer a command structure in this case
(it's already mapped for DMA).  The TRE is added to a transaction
using ipa_cmd_ip_tag_status_add(), but we ignore the size value
provided to that function.  So just get rid of the size argument.
