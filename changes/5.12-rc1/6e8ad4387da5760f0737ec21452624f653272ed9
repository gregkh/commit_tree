octeontx2-pf: cn10k: Map LMTST region

On CN10K platform transmit/receive buffer alloc and free from/to hardware
had changed to support burst operation. Whereas pervious silicon's only
support single buffer free at a time.
To Support the same firmware allocates a DRAM region for each PF/VF for
storing LMTLINES. These LMTLINES are used for NPA batch free and for
flushing SQE to the hardware.
PF/VF LMTST region is accessed via BAR4. PFs LMTST region is followed
by its VFs mbox memory. The size of region varies from 2KB to 256KB based
on number of LMTLINES configured.

This patch adds support for
- Mapping PF/VF LMTST region.
- Reserves 0-71 (RX + TX + XDP) LMTST lines for NPA batch
  free operation.
- Reserves 72-512 LMTST lines for NIX SQE flush.
