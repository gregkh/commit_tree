mac80211: fix potential overflow when multiplying to u32 integers

The multiplication of the u32 variables tx_time and estimated_retx is
performed using a 32 bit multiplication and the result is stored in
a u64 result. This has a potential u32 overflow issue, so avoid this
by casting tx_time to a u64 to force a 64 bit multiply.
