ptp: ptp_clockmatrix: Add wait_for_sys_apll_dpll_lock.

Part of the device initialization aligns the rising edge of the output
clock to the internal 1 PPS clock. If the system APLL and DPLL is not
locked, then the alignment will fail and there will be a fixed offset
between the internal 1 PPS clock and the output clock.

After loading the device firmware, poll the system APLL and DPLL for
locked state prior to initialization, timing out after 2 seconds.
