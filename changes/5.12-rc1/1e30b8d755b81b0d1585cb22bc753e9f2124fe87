net: smsc911x: Make Runtime PM handling more fine-grained

Currently the smsc911x driver has mininal power management: during
driver probe, the device is powered up, and during driver remove, it is
powered down.

Improve power management by making it more fine-grained:
  1. Power the device down when driver probe is finished,
  2. Power the device (down) when it is opened (closed),
  3. Make sure the device is powered during PHY access.
