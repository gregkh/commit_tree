soc: fsl: qe: store muram_vbase as a void pointer instead of u8

The two functions cpm_muram_offset() and cpm_muram_dma() both need a
cast currently, one casts muram_vbase to do the pointer arithmetic on
void pointers, the other casts the passed-in address u8*.

It's simpler and more consistent to just always use void* and drop all
the casting.
