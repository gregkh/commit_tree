xhci: handle halting transfer event properly after endpoint stop and halt raced.

If we receive a transfer event indicating that an endpoint should be
halted, but current endpoint state doesn't match it, then the halt might
be just resolved by the stop endpoint completion handler that detects the
halted endpoint due to a context state error.

In this case the TD we halted on is already moved to the cancelled TD list,
and should not be successfully completed and given back anymore.
Let the stop endpoint completion handler reset the endpoint, and then let
the reset endpoint handler give back the cancelled TD among all other
ones on the cancelled TD list
