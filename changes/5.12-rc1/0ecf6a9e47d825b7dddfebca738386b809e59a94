powerpc/64: Make stack tracing work during very early boot

If we try to stack trace very early during boot, either due to a
WARN/BUG or manual dump_stack(), we will oops in
valid_emergency_stack() when we try to dereference the paca_ptrs
array.

The fix is simple, we just return false if paca_ptrs isn't allocated
yet. The stack pointer definitely isn't part of any emergency stack
because we haven't allocated any yet.
