phy: qcom-qmp: Add SM8350 USB QMP PHYs

Add support for the USB DP & UNI PHYs found on SM8350. These use
version 5.0.0 of the QMP PHY IP and thus require new "V5"
definitions of the register offset macros for the QSERDES RX
and TX blocks. The QSERDES common and QPHY PCS blocks' register
offsets are largely unchanged from V4 so some of the existing
macros can be reused.
