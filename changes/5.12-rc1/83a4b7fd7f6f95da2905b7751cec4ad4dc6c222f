media: allegro: move encoding options to channel

There are several encoding options that are hard coded in the parameter
that is used to configure the hardware codec. However, some of the
options must be written to the SPS/PPS by the driver. Furthermore, some
of the options depend on the codec that is used (i.e. H.264 or HEVC).

Therefore, move options that depend on the codec to the channel and add
constants for options that are independent of the codec but must be
written to the SPS/PPS.
