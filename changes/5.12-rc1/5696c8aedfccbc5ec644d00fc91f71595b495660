net: dsa: Don't offload port attributes on standalone ports

In a situation where a standalone port is indirectly attached to a
bridge (e.g. via a LAG) which is not offloaded, do not offload any
port attributes either. The port should behave as a standard NIC.

Previously, on mv88e6xxx, this meant that in the following setup:

     br0
     /
  team0
   / \
swp0 swp1

If vlan filtering was enabled on br0, swp0's and swp1's QMode was set
to "secure". This caused all untagged packets to be dropped, as their
default VID (0) was not loaded into the VTU.
