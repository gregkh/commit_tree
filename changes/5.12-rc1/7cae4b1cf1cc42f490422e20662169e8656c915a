x86/ftrace: Support objtool vmlinux.o validation in ftrace_64.S

With objtool vmlinux.o validation of return_to_handler(), now that
objtool has visibility inside the retpoline, jumping from EMPTY state to
a proper function state results in a stack state mismatch.

return_to_handler() is actually quite normal despite the underlying
magic.  Just annotate it as a normal function.
