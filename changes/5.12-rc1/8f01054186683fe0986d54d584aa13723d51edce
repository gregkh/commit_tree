net/mlx5: SF, Add port add delete functionality

To handle SF port management outside of the eswitch as independent
software layer, introduce eswitch notifier APIs so that mlx5 upper
layer who wish to support sf port management in switchdev mode can
perform its task whenever eswitch mode is set to switchdev or before
eswitch is disabled.

Initialize sf port table on such eswitch event.

Add SF port add and delete functionality in switchdev mode.
Destroy all SF ports when eswitch is disabled.
Expose SF port add and delete to user via devlink commands.

$ devlink dev eswitch set pci/0000:06:00.0 mode switchdev

$ devlink port show
