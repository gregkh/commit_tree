selftests: netdevsim: Add fib_notifications test

Add test to check fib notifications behavior.

The test checks route addition, route deletion and route replacement for
both IPv4 and IPv6.

When fib_notify_on_flag_change=0, expect single notification for route
addition/deletion/replacement.

When fib_notify_on_flag_change=1, expect:
- two notification for route addition/replacement, first without RTM_F_TRAP
  and second with RTM_F_TRAP.
- single notification for route deletion.

$ ./fib_notifications.sh
