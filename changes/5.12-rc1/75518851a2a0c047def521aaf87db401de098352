skbuff: Push status and refcounts into sock_zerocopy_callback

Before this change, the caller of sock_zerocopy_callback would
need to save the zerocopy status, decrement and check the refcount,
and then call the callback function - the callback was only invoked
when the refcount reached zero.

Now, the caller just passes the status into the callback function,
which saves the status and handles its own refcounts.

This makes the behavior of the sock_zerocopy_callback identical
to the tpacket and vhost callbacks.
