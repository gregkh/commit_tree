xhci: prevent a theoretical endless loop while preparing rings.

xhci driver links together segments in a ring buffer by turning the last
TRB of a segment into a link TRB, pointing to the beginning of
the next segment.

If the first TRB of every segment for some unknown reason is a link TRB
pointing to the next segment, then prepare_ring() loops indefinitely.
This isn't something the xhci driver would do.
xHC hardware has access to these rings, it sholdn't be writing link
TRBs either, but with broken xHC hardware this could in theory be
possible.
