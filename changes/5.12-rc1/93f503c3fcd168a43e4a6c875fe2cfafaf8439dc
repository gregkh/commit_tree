mm: fix prototype warning from kernel test robot

Patch series "mm: clean up names and parameters of memmap_init_xxxx functions", v5.

This patchset corrects inappropriate function names of memmap_init_xxx,
and simplify parameters of functions in the code flow.  And also fix a
prototype warning reported by lkp.

This patch (of 5);

Kernel test robot calling make with 'W=1' is triggering warning like
below for memmap_init_zone() function.

  mm/page_alloc.c:6259:23: warning: no previous prototype for 'memmap_init_zone' [-Wmissing-prototypes]
   6259 | void __meminit __weak memmap_init_zone(unsigned long size, int nid,
        |                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix it by adding the function declaration in include/linux/mm.h.  Since
memmap_init_zone() has a generic version with '__weak', the declaratoin in
ia64 header file can be simply removed.
