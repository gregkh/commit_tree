csky: Fixup swapon

Current csky's swappon is broken by wrong swap PTE entry format.
Now redesign the new format for abiv1 & abiv2 and make swappon +
zram work properly on csky machines.

C-SKY PTE has VALID, DIRTY to emulate PRESENT, READ, WRITE, EXEC
attributes. GLOBAL bit is shared by two pages in the same tlb
entry. So we need to keep GLOBAL, VALID, PRESENT zero in swp_pte.

To distinguish PAGE_NONE and swp_pte, we need to use an additional
bit (abiv1 is _PAGE_READ, abiv2 is _PAGE_WRITE).
