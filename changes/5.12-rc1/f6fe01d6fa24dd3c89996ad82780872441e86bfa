net: mscc: ocelot: auto-detect packet buffer size and number of frame references

Instead of reading these values from the reference manual and writing
them down into the driver, it appears that the hardware gives us the
option of detecting them dynamically.

The number of frame references corresponds to what the reference manual
notes, however it seems that the frame buffers are reported as slightly
less than the books would indicate. On VSC9959 (Felix), the books say it
should have 128KB of packet buffer, but the registers indicate only
129840 bytes (126.79 KB). Also, the unit of measurement for FREECNT from
the documentation of all these devices is incorrect (taken from an older
generation). This was confirmed by Younes Leroul from Microchip support.

Not having anything better to do with these values at the moment* (this
will change soon), let's just print them.

*The frame buffer size is, in fact, used to calculate the tail dropping
watermarks.
