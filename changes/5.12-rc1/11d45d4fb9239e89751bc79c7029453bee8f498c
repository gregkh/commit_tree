perf test: Output the sub testing result in cs-etm

The CoreSight testing contains sub cases, e.g. every CPU iterates the
possible conntected sinks and tests the paths between the associated ETM
with the found sink.  Besides the per-thread testing, it also contains
system wide testing and snapshot testing.

To easier observe results for the sub cases, this patch introduces a new
function arm_cs_report(), it outputs the result as "PASS" or "FAIL" for
every sub case; and it records the error in the variable "glb_err" which
is used as the final return value when exits the testing.

Before:

  # perf test 73 -v
  73: Check Arm CoreSight trace data recording and synthesized samples:
  --- start ---
  test child forked, pid 17423
  Recording trace (only user mode) with path: CPU0 => tmc_etf0
