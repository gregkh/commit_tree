KVM: x86/xen: intercept xen hypercalls if enabled

Add a new exit reason for emulator to handle Xen hypercalls.

Since this means KVM owns the ABI, dispense with the facility for the
VMM to provide its own copy of the hypercall pages; just fill them in
directly using VMCALL/VMMCALL as we do for the Hyper-V hypercall page.

This behaviour is enabled by a new INTERCEPT_HCALL flag in the
KVM_XEN_HVM_CONFIG ioctl structure, and advertised by the same flag
being returned from the KVM_CAP_XEN_HVM check.

Rename xen_hvm_config() to kvm_xen_write_hypercall_page() and move it
to the nascent xen.c while we're at it, and add a test case.
