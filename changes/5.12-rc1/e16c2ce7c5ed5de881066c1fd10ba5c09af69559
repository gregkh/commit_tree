perf record: Fix continue profiling after draining the buffer

Commit da231338ec9c0987 ("perf record: Use an eventfd to wakeup when
done") uses eventfd() to solve a rare race where the setting and
checking of 'done' which add done_fd to pollfd.  When draining buffer,
revents of done_fd is 0 and evlist__filter_pollfd function returns a
non-zero value.  As a result, perf record does not stop profiling.

The following simple scenarios can trigger this condition:

  # sleep 10 &
  # perf record -p $!

After the sleep process exits, perf record should stop profiling and exit.
However, perf record keeps running.

If pollfd revents contains only POLLERR or POLLHUP, perf record
indicates that buffer is draining and need to stop profiling.  Use
fdarray_flag__nonfilterable() to set done eventfd to nonfilterable
objects, so that evlist__filter_pollfd() does not filter and check done
eventfd.
