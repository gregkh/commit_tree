drm/amd/display: fix unused variable warning

After all users of the 'dm' warnings got hidden in an #ifdef,
the compiler started warning about it being unused:

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c:5380:33: error: unused variable 'dm' [-Werror,-Wunused-variable]

Add another such #ifdef.
