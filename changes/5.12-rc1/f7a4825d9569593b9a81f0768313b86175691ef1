KVM: arm64: Add symbol at the beginning of each hyp section

Generating hyp relocations will require referencing positions at a given
offset from the beginning of hyp sections. Since the final layout will
not be determined until the linking of `vmlinux`, modify the hyp linker
script to insert a symbol at the first byte of each hyp section to use
as an anchor. The linker of `vmlinux` will place the symbols together
with the sections.
