mm: make pagecache tagged lookups return only head pages

Patch series "Overhaul multi-page lookups for THP", v4.

This THP prep patchset changes several page cache iteration APIs to only
return head pages.

 - It's only possible to tag head pages in the page cache, so only
   return head pages, not all their subpages.
 - Factor a lot of common code out of the various batch lookup routines
 - Add mapping_seek_hole_data()
 - Unify find_get_entries() and pagevec_lookup_entries()
 - Make find_get_entries only return head pages, like find_get_entry().

These are only loosely connected, but they seem to make sense together as
a series.

This patch (of 14):

Pagecache tags are used for dirty page writeback.  Since dirtiness is
tracked on a per-THP basis, we only want to return the head page rather
than each subpage of a tagged page.  All the filesystems which use huge
pages today are in-memory, so there are no tagged huge pages today.
