mmc: sdhci-msm: Actually set the actual clock

The MSM SDHCI driver always set the "actual_clock" field to 0.  It had
a comment about it not being needed because we weren't using the
standard SDHCI divider mechanism and we'd just fallback to
"host->clock".  However, it's still better to provide the actual
clock.  Why?

1. It will make timeout calculations slightly better.  On one system I
   have, the eMMC requets 200 MHz (for HS400-ES) but actually gets 192
   MHz.  These are close, but why not get the more accurate one.

2. If things are seriously off in the clock driver and it's missing
   rates or picking the wrong rate (maybe it's rounding up instead of
   down), this will make it much more obvious what's going on.

NOTE: we have to be a little careful here because the "actual_clock"
field shouldn't include the multiplier that sdhci-msm needs
internally.
