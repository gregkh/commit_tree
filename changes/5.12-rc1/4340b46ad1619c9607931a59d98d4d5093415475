drm/msm/a5xx: Separate A5XX_PC_DBG_ECO_CNTL write from main branch

The "main" if branch where we program the other registers for the
Adreno 5xx family of GPUs should not contain the PC_DBG_ECO_CNTL
register programming because this has logical similarity
differences from all the others.

A later commit will show the entire sense of this.
