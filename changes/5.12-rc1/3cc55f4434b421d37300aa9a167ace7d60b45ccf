nfs: use change attribute for NFS re-exports

When exporting NFS, we may as well use the real change attribute
returned by the original server instead of faking up a change attribute
from the ctime.

Note we can't do that by setting I_VERSION--that would also turn on the
logic in iversion.h which treats the lower bit specially, and that
doesn't make sense for NFS.

So instead we define a new export operation for filesystems like NFS
that want to manage the change attribute themselves.
