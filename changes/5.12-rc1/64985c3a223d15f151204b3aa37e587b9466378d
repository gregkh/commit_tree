s390: use WRITE_ONCE when re-allocating async stack

The code does:

S390_lowcore.async_stack = new + STACK_INIT_OFFSET;

But the compiler is free to first assign one value and
add the other value later. If a IRQ would be coming in
between these two operations, it would run with an invalid
stack. Prevent this by using WRITE_ONCE.
