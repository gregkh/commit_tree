nvme-hwmon: rework to avoid devm allocation

The original design to use device-managed resource allocation
doesn't really work as the NVMe controller has a vastly different
lifetime than the hwmon sysfs attributes, causing warning about
duplicate sysfs entries upon reconnection.
This patch reworks the hwmon allocation to avoid device-managed
resource allocation, and uses the NVMe controller as parent for
the sysfs attributes.
