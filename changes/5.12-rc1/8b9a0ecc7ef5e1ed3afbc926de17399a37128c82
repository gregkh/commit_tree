rcu: Unconditionally use rcuc threads on PREEMPT_RT

PREEMPT_RT systems have long used the rcutree.use_softirq kernel
boot parameter to avoid use of RCU_SOFTIRQ handlers, which can disrupt
real-time applications by invoking callbacks during return from interrupts
that arrived while executing time-critical code.  This kernel boot
parameter instead runs RCU core processing in an 'rcuc' kthread, thus
allowing the scheduler to do its job of avoiding disrupting time-critical
code.

This commit therefore disables the rcutree.use_softirq kernel boot
parameter on PREEMPT_RT systems, thus forcing such systems to do RCU
core processing in 'rcuc' kthreads.  This approach has long been in
use by users of the -rt patchset, and there have been no complaints.
There is therefore no way for the system administrator to override this
choice, at least without modifying and rebuilding the kernel.
