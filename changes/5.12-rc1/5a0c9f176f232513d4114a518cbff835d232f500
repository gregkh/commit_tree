virt: acrn: Introduce I/O ranges operation interfaces

An I/O request of a User VM, which is constructed by hypervisor, is
distributed by the ACRN Hypervisor Service Module to an I/O client
corresponding to the address range of the I/O request.

I/O client maintains a list of address ranges. Introduce
acrn_ioreq_range_{add,del}() to manage these address ranges.
