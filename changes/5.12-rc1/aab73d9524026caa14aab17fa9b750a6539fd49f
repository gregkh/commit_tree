tpm: add sysfs exports for all banks of PCR registers

Create sysfs per hash groups with 24 PCR files in them one group,
named pcr-<hash>, for each agile hash of the TPM.  The files are
plugged in to a PCR read function which is TPM version agnostic, so
this works also for TPM 1.2 but the hash is only sha1 in that case.

Note: the macros used to create the hashes emit spurious checkpatch
warnings.  Do not try to "fix" them as checkpatch recommends, otherwise
they'll break.
