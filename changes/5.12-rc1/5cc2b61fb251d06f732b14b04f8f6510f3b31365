drm/i915/display: Suppress "Combo PHY A HW state changed unexpectedly"

We know a problem exists in the ifwi shipped with the early
pre-production Tigerlake and DG1 prototypes, later revisions are fine.
However, CI still relies on the earlier ifwi and we grow tired of
the volume of warnings as we wait for replacements.

Since the warning is a bug, we do not want to lose the warning in its
entirety, so only suppress the warning for the platforms currently
exhibiting the issue.
