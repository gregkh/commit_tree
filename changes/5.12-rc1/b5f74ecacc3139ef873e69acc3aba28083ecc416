block, bfq: use half slice_idle as a threshold to check short ttime

The value of the I/O plugging (idling) timeout is used also as the
think-time threshold to decide whether a process has a short think
time.  In this respect, a good value of this timeout for rotational
drives is un the order of several ms. Yet, this is often too long a
time interval to be effective as a think-time threshold. This commit
mitigates this problem (by a lot, according to tests), by halving the
threshold.
