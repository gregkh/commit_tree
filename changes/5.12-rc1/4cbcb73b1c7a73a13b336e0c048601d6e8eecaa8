EDAC/amd64: Issue probing messages only on properly detected hardware

amd64_edac was converted to CPU family autoprobing (from PCI device
IDs) to not have to add a new PCI device ID each time a new platform is
shipped but to support the whole family out-of-the-box.

However, this caused a lot of noise in dmesg even when the machine
doesn't have ECC DIMMs or ECC has been disabled in the BIOS:

  EDAC MC: Ver: 3.0.0
  EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 0).
  EDAC amd64: Node 0: DRAM ECC disabled.
  EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 1).
  EDAC amd64: Node 1: DRAM ECC disabled.
  EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 2).
  EDAC amd64: Node 2: DRAM ECC disabled.
  EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 3).
  EDAC amd64: Node 3: DRAM ECC disabled.
  EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 4).
  EDAC amd64: Node 4: DRAM ECC disabled.
  EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 5).
  EDAC amd64: Node 5: DRAM ECC disabled.
  EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 6).
  EDAC amd64: Node 6: DRAM ECC disabled.
  EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 7).
  EDAC amd64: Node 7: DRAM ECC disabled.

or even

$ grep EDAC dmesg.log | sed 's/\[.*\] //' | sort | uniq -c
    128 EDAC amd64: F17h detected (node 0).
    128 EDAC amd64: Node 0: DRAM ECC disabled.
      1 EDAC MC: Ver: 3.0.0

on a big machine. Yap, that's once per CPU for 128 of them.

So move the init messages after all probing has succeeded to avoid
unnecessary spew in dmesg.
