ice: report timeout length for erasing during devlink flash

When erasing, notify userspace of how long we will potentially take to
erase a module. Doing so allows userspace to report the timeout, giving
a clear indication of the upper time bound of the operation.

Since we're re-using the erase timeout value, make it a macro rather
than a magic number.
