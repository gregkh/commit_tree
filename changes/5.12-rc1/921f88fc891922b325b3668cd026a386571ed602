bpf: Add size arg to build_id_parse function

It's possible to have other build id types (other than default SHA1).
Currently there's also ld support for MD5 build id.

Adding size argument to build_id_parse function, that returns (if defined)
size of the parsed build id, so we can recognize the build id type.
