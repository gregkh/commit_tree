soundwire: cadence: reduce timeout on transactions

Currently the timeout for SoundWire individual transactions is 2s.

This is too large in comparison with the enumeration and completion
timeouts used in codec drivers.

A command will typically be handled in less than 100us, so 500ms for
the command completion is more than generous.
