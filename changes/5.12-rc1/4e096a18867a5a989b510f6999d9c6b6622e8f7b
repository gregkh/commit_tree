net: introduce CAN specific pointer in the struct net_device

Since 20dd3850bcf8 ("can: Speed up CAN frame receiption by using
ml_priv") the CAN framework uses per device specific data in the AF_CAN
protocol. For this purpose the struct net_device->ml_priv is used. Later
the ml_priv usage in CAN was extended for other users, one of them being
CAN_J1939.

Later in the kernel ml_priv was converted to an union, used by other
drivers. E.g. the tun driver started storing it's stats pointer.

Since tun devices can claim to be a CAN device, CAN specific protocols
will wrongly interpret this pointer, which will cause system crashes.
Mostly this issue is visible in the CAN_J1939 stack.

To fix this issue, we request a dedicated CAN pointer within the
net_device struct.
