driver core: fw_devlink: Handle suppliers that don't use driver core

Device links only work between devices that use the driver core to match
and bind a driver to a device. So, add an API for frameworks to let the
driver core know that a fwnode has been initialized by a driver without
using the driver core.

Then use this information to make sure that fw_devlink doesn't make the
consumers wait indefinitely on suppliers that'll never bind to a driver.
