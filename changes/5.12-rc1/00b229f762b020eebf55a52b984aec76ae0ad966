net: fix GSO for SG-enabled devices

The commit dbd50f238dec ("net: move the hsize check to the else
block in skb_segment") introduced a data corruption for devices
supporting scatter-gather.

The problem boils down to signed/unsigned comparison given
unexpected results: if signed 'hsize' is negative, it will be
considered greater than a positive 'len', which is unsigned.

This commit addresses resorting to the old checks order, so that
'hsize' never has a negative value when compared with 'len'.

v1 -> v2:
 - reorder hsize checks instead of explicit cast (Alex)
