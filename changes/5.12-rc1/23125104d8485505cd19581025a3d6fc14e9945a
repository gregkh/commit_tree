btrfs: make btrfs_root::free_objectid hold the next available objectid

Adjust the way free_objectid is being initialized, it now stores
BTRFS_FIRST_FREE_OBJECTID rather than the, somewhat arbitrary,
BTRFS_FIRST_FREE_OBJECTID - 1. This change also has the added benefit
that now it becomes unnecessary to explicitly initialize free_objectid
for a newly create fs root.
