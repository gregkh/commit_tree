virt: acrn: Introduce interfaces to query C-states and P-states allowed by hypervisor

The C-states and P-states data are used to support CPU power management.
The hypervisor controls C-states and P-states for a User VM.

ACRN userspace need to query the data from the hypervisor to build ACPI
tables for a User VM.

HSM provides ioctls for ACRN userspace to query C-states and P-states
data obtained from the hypervisor.
