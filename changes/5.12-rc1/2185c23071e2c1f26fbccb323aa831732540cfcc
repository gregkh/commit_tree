powercap/drivers/dtpm: Fix a double shift bug

The DTPM_POWER_LIMIT_FLAG is used for test_bit() etc which take a bit
number so it should be bit 0.  But currently it's set to BIT(0) then
that is double shifted equivalent to BIT(BIT(0)).  This doesn't cause a
run time problem because it's done consistently.
