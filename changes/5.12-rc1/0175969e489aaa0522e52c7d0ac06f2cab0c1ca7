drm/i915/gem: Use shrinkable status for unknown swizzle quirks

Give obj->mm.quirked a name much more reflective of its purpose
(i915_gem_object_has_tiling_quirk) and move it from the obj->mm field as
it doesn't denote a quirk of the backing store, but a quirk in the
object in its treatment of the backing pages, similar to tiling modes.

Then instead of abusing the pinned status of the buffer to protect it
from the shrinker, we can instead hide the buffer from the shrinker so
it is never considered for being swapped.
