Drivers: hv: vmbus: Initialize memory to be sent to the host

__vmbus_open() and vmbus_teardown_gpadl() do not inizialite the memory
for the vmbus_channel_open_channel and the vmbus_channel_gpadl_teardown
objects they allocate respectively.  These objects contain padding bytes
and fields that are left uninitialized and that are later sent to the
host, potentially leaking guest data.  Zero initialize such fields to
avoid leaking sensitive information to the host.
