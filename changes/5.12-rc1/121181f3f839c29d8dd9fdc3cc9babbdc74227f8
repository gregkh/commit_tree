scsi: libsas: Remove notifier indirection

LLDDs report events to libsas with .notify_port_event and .notify_phy_event
callbacks.

These callbacks are fixed and so there is no reason why the functions
cannot be called directly, so do that.

This neatens the code slightly, makes it more obvious, and reduces function
pointer usage, which is generally a good thing. Downside is that there are
2x more symbol exports.
