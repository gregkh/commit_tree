powerpc/syscall: Avoid storing 'current' in another pointer

By saving the pointer pointing to thread_info.flags, gcc copies r2
in a non-volatile register.

We know 'current' doesn't change, so avoid that intermediaite pointer.

Reduces null_syscall benchmark by 2 cycles (322 => 320 cycles)

On PPC64, gcc seems to know that 'current' is not changing, and it keeps
it in a non volatile register to avoid multiple read of 'current' in paca.
