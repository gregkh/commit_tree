iwlwifi: mvm: don't check system_pm_mode without mutex held

When we want to stop TX'ing because we are suspending, we
have two options: either we check system_pm_mode or we
check the mvm's status that has a bit for the suspend
flow.
The latter is better because test_bit is atomic. Also
add a call to synchronize_net after we set the bit to
make sure that all the new Tx see the bit before we
actually complete the suspend flow.
