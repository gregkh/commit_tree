selftests: mptcp: add IPv4-mapped IPv6 testcases

Here, we make sure we support IPv4-mapped in IPv6 addresses in different
contexts:

- a v4-mapped address is received by the PM and can be used as v4.
- a v4 address is received by the PM and can be used even with a v4
  mapped socket.

We also make sure we don't try to establish subflows between v4 and v6
addresses, e.g. if a real v6 address ends with a valid v4 address.
