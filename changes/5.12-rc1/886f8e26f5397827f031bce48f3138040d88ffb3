net: dsa: document the existing switch tree notifiers and add a new one

The existence of dsa_broadcast has generated some confusion in the past:
https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg365042.html

So let's document the existing dsa_port_notify and dsa_broadcast
functions and explain when each of them should be used.

Also, in fact, the in-between function has always been there but was
lacking a name, and is the main reason for this patch: dsa_tree_notify.
Refactor dsa_broadcast to use it.

This patch also moves dsa_broadcast (a top-level function) to dsa2.c,
where it really belonged in the first place, but had no companion so it
stood with dsa_port_notify.
