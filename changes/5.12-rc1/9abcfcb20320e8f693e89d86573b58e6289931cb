nios2: fixed broken sys_clone syscall

The tls pointer must be pushed on the stack prior to calling nios2_clone
as it is the 5th function argument. Prior handling of the tls pointer was
done inside former called function copy_thread_tls using the r8 register
from the current_pt_regs directly. This was a bad design and resulted in
the current bug introduced in 04bd52fb.

Fixes: 04bd52fb ("nios2: enable HAVE_COPY_THREAD_TLS, switch to kernel_clone_args")
