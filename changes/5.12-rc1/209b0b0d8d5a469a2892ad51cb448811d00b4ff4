ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: add mic:dmic and cfg-mics component strings

UCM needs to know which microphone is used (dmic or RT715-based),
let's add the information in the component string.

Note the slight change from HDAudio platforms where 'cfg-dmics' was
used. 'cfg-mics' is used here with the intent that this component
string describes either the number of PCH-attached microphones or the
number of RT715-attached ones (the assumption is that the two
configurations are mutually exclusive).
