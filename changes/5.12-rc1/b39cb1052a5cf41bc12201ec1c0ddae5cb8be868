cxl/mem: Register CXL memX devices

Create the /sys/bus/cxl hierarchy to enumerate:

* Memory Devices (per-endpoint control devices)

* Memory Address Space Devices (platform address ranges with
  interleaving, performance, and persistence attributes)

* Memory Regions (active provisioned memory from an address space device
  that is in use as System RAM or delegated to libnvdimm as Persistent
  Memory regions).

For now, only the per-endpoint control devices are registered on the
'cxl' bus. However, going forward it will provide a mechanism to
coordinate cross-device interleave.
