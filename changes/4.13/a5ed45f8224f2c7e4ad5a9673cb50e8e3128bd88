btrfs: Convert fs_info->free_chunk_space to atomic64_t

The ->free_chunk_space variable is used to track the unallocated space
and access to it is protected by a spinlock, which is not used for
anything else.  Make the code a bit self-explanatory by switching the
variable to an atomic64_t type and kill the spinlock.

[ not a performance critical code, use of atomic type is ok ]
