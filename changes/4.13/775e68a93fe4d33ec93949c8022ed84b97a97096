tcp: use TS opt on RTTs for congestion control

Currently when a data packet is retransmitted, we do not compute an
RTT sample for congestion control due to Kern's check. Therefore the
congestion control that uses RTT signals may not receive any update
during loss recovery which could last many round trips. For example,
BBR and Vegas may not be able to update its min RTT estimation if the
network path has shortened until it recovers from losses. This patch
mitigates that by using TCP timestamp options for RTT measurement
for congestion control. Note that we already use timestamps for
RTT estimation.
