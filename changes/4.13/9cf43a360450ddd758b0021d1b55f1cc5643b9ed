scsi: cxlflash: Support LUN provisioning

Adopt the SISLite AFU LUN provisioning capability to allow future CXL
Flash adapters the ability to better manage storage. Update the SISLite
header with the changes necessary to support LUN provision operations
and create a host ioctl interface for user LUN management software. Also
update the cxlflash documentation to describe this new host ioctl.
