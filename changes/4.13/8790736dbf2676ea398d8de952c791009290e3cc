xhci: Add stream id to xhci_dequeue_state structure

The values for the new dequeue segment, new dequeue pointer and new cycle
state are needed for manually moving the xHC ring dequeue pointer.
These are conveniently stored in a xhci_dequeue_state structure.

stream support was added later and stream_id was carried
as a function parameter.

Move the stream_id to the xhci_dequeue_state structure instead.
