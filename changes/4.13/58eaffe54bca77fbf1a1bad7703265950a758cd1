scsi: aacraid: Set correct Queue Depth for HBA1000 RAW disks

The default queue depth for non NATIVE RAW disks is calculated from the
number of fibs and number of disks or a max of 256. This causes poor disk
IO performance.

The fix is to set default qd based on the type of disks
(SATA -32 and SAS -64)
