mtd: nand: Make sure drivers not supporting SET/GET_FEATURES return -ENOTSUPP

A lot of drivers are providing their own ->cmdfunc(), and most of the
time this implementation does not support all possible NAND operations.
But since ->cmdfunc() cannot return an error code, the core has no way
to know that the operation it requested is not supported.

This is a problem we cannot address for all kind of operations with the
current design, but we can prevent these silent failures for the
GET/SET FEATURES operation by overloading the default
->onfi_{set,get}_features() methods with one returning -ENOTSUPP.
