powerpc: Fix VSX enabling/flushing to also test MSR_FP and MSR_VEC

VSX uses a combination of the old vector registers, the old FP
registers and new "second halves" of the FP registers.

Thus when we need to see the VSX state in the thread struct
(flush_vsx_to_thread()) or when we'll use the VSX in the kernel
(enable_kernel_vsx()) we need to ensure they are all flushed into
the thread struct if either of them is individually enabled.

Unfortunately we only tested if the whole VSX was enabled, not if they
were individually enabled.

Fixes: 72cd7b44bc99 ("powerpc: Uncomment and make enable_kernel_vsx() routine available")
