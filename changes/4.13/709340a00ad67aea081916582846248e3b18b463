cifs: set oparms.create_options rather than or'ing in CREATE_OPEN_BACKUP_INTENT

Currently oparms.create_options is uninitialized and the code is logically
or'ing in CREATE_OPEN_BACKUP_INTENT onto a garbage value of
oparms.create_options from the stack.  Fix this by just setting the value
rather than or'ing in the setting.
