tracing: define TRACE_DEFINE_SIZEOF() macro to map sizeof's to their values

Perf has a problem that if sizeof() macros are used within TRACE_EVENT()
macro's they end up in userspace as "sizeof(kernel structure)" which
cannot properly be parsed. Add a macro which can forward this data
through the eval_map for userspace utilization.
