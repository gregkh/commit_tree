NFSv4.1: Handle EXCHGID4_FLAG_CONFIRMED_R during NFSv4.1 migration

Transparent State Migration copies a client's lease state from the
server where a filesystem used to reside to the server where it now
resides. When an NFSv4.1 client first contacts that destination
server, it uses EXCHANGE_ID to detect trunking relationships.

The lease that was copied there is returned to that client, but the
destination server sets EXCHGID4_FLAG_CONFIRMED_R when replying to
the client. This is because the lease was confirmed on the source
server (before it was copied).

Normally, when CONFIRMED_R is set, a client purges the lease and
creates a new one. However, that throws away the entire benefit of
Transparent State Migration.

Therefore, the client must not purge that lease when it is possible
that Transparent State Migration has occurred.
