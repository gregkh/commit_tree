powerpc: Fix /proc/cpuinfo revision for POWER9 DD2

The P9 PVR bits 12-15 don't indicate a revision but instead different
chip configurations.  From BookIV we have:
   Bits      Configuration
    0 :    Scale out 12 cores
    1 :    Scale out 24 cores
    2 :    Scale up  12 cores
    3 :    Scale up  24 cores

DD1 doesn't use this but DD2 does. Linux will mostly use the "Scale
out 24 core" configuration (ie. SMT4 not SMT8) which results in a PVR
of 0x004e1200. The reported revision in /proc/cpuinfo is hence
reported incorrectly as "18.0".

This patch fixes this to mask off only the relevant bits for the major
revision (ie. bits 8-11) for POWER9.
