acpi: apei: handle SEA notification type for ARMv8

ARM APEI extension proposal added SEA (Synchronous External Abort)
notification type for ARMv8.
Add a new GHES error source handling function for SEA. If an error
source's notification type is SEA, then this function can be registered
into the SEA exception handler. That way GHES will parse and report
SEA exceptions when they occur.
An SEA can interrupt code that had interrupts masked and is treated as
an NMI. To aid this the page of address space for mapping APEI buffers
while in_nmi() is always reserved, and ghes_ioremap_pfn_nmi() is
changed to use the helper methods to find the prot_t to map with in
the same way as ghes_ioremap_pfn_irq().
