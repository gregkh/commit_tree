usb: host: ohci-omap3: Remove driver in favor of ohci-platform

This driver is no longer needed and can be removed. The reason why
it's safe to remove this driver is that most omap devices don't have a
USB low-speed or full-speed compatible PHY installed and configured
with drivers/mfd/omap-usb-host.c. This means that devices like
beagleboard and pandaboard need to use a high-speed USB hub in order
to use devices like keyboard and mice.

Currently the only known configured for a full-speed PHY is the
mdm6600 modem on droid 4 and I've verified it works just fine with
ohci-platform.
