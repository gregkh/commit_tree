xfrm: extend MIGRATE with UDP encapsulation port

Add UDP encapsulation port to XFRM_MSG_MIGRATE using an optional
netlink attribute XFRMA_ENCAP.

The devices that support IKE MOBIKE extension (RFC-4555 Section 3.8)
could go to sleep for a few minutes and wake up. When it wake up the
NAT mapping could have expired, the device send a MOBIKE UPDATE_SA
message to migrate the IPsec SA. The change could be a change UDP
encapsulation port, IP address, or both.
