posix-cpu-timers: Make timespec to nsec conversion safe

The expiry time of a posix cpu timer is supplied through sys_timer_set()
via a struct timespec. The timespec is validated for correctness.

In the actual set timer implementation the timespec is converted to a
scalar nanoseconds value. If the tv_sec part of the time spec is large
enough the conversion to nanoseconds (sec * NSEC_PER_SEC) overflows 64bit.

Mitigate that by using the timespec_to_ktime() conversion function, which
checks the tv_sec part for a potential mult overflow and clamps the result
to KTIME_MAX, which is about 292 years.
