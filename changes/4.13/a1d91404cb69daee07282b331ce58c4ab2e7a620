pktcdvd: use bio_clone_fast() instead of bio_clone()

pktcdvd doesn't change the bi_io_vec of the clone bio,
so it is more efficient to use bio_clone_fast(), and not clone
the bi_io_vec.
This requires providing a bio_set, and it is safest to
provide a dedicated bio_set rather than sharing
fs_bio_set, which filesytems use.
This new bio_set, pkt_bio_set, can also be use for the bio_split()
call as the two allocations (bio_clone_fast, and bio_split) are
independent, neither can block a bio allocated by the other.
