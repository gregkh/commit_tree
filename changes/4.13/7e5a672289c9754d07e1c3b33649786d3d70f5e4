KVM: arm/arm64: Handle hva aging while destroying the vm

The mmu_notifier_release() callback of KVM triggers cleaning up
the stage2 page table on kvm-arm. However there could be other
notifier callbacks in parallel with the mmu_notifier_release(),
which could cause the call backs ending up in an empty stage2
page table. Make sure we check it for all the notifier callbacks.
