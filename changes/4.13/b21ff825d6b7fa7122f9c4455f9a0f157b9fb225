mtd: nand: denali: set NAND_ECC_CUSTOM_PAGE_ACCESS

The denali_cmdfunc() actually does nothing valuable for
NAND_CMD_{PAGEPROG,READ0,SEQIN}.

For NAND_CMD_{READ0,SEQIN}, it copies "page" to "denali->page", then
denali_read_page(_raw) compares them just for the sanity check.
(Inconsistently, this check is missing from denali_write_page(_raw).)

The Denali controller is equipped with high level read/write interface,
so let's skip unneeded call of cmdfunc().

If NAND_ECC_CUSTOM_PAGE_ACCESS is set, nand_write_page() will not
call ->waitfunc hook.  So, ->write_page(_raw) hooks should directly
return -EIO on failure.  The error handling of page writes will be
much simpler.
