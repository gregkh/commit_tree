scsi: Protect SCSI device state changes with a mutex

Serializing SCSI device state changes avoids that two state changes can
occur concurrently, e.g. the state changes in scsi_target_block() and
__scsi_remove_device(). This serialization is essential to make patch
"Make __scsi_remove_device go straight from BLOCKED to DEL" work
reliably.

Enable this mechanism for all scsi_target_*block() callers but not for
the scsi_internal_device_unblock() calls from the mpt3sas driver because
that driver can call scsi_internal_device_unblock() from atomic context.
