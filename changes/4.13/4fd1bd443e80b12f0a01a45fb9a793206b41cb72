powerpc/pseries: Fix of_node_put() underflow during reconfig remove

As for commit 68baf692c435 ("powerpc/pseries: Fix of_node_put()
underflow during DLPAR remove"), the call to of_node_put() must be
removed from pSeries_reconfig_remove_node().

dlpar_detach_node() and pSeries_reconfig_remove_node() both call
of_detach_node(), and thus the node should not be released in both
cases.
