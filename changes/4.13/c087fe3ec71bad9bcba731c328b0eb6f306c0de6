[media] av7110: avoid switch fall through

On two switches, this driver have unannotated switch
fall through.

in the first case, it falls through a return. On the second
one, it prints undesired log messages on fall through.

Solve that by copying the commands that it should be
running. Gcc will very likely optimize it anyway, so this
sholdn't be causing any harm, and shuts up gcc warnings.
