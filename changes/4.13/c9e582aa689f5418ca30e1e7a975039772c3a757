libnvdimm, nfit: enable support for volatile ranges

Allow volatile nfit ranges to participate in all the same infrastructure
provided for persistent memory regions. A resulting resulting namespace
device will still be called "pmem", but the parent region type will be
"nd_volatile". This is in preparation for disabling the dax ->flush()
operation in the pmem driver when it is hosted on a volatile range.
