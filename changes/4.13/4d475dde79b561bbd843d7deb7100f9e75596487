EDAC, sb_edac: Check if ECC enabled when at least one DIMM is present

This is based on previous work by Patrick Geary, see Link.

Additional cleanups ontop:

 - Remove the code to read MCMTR from pci_ha1_ta and CHN_TO_HA macro,
 now that TA0 and TA1 are unified.

 - Remove get_pdev_same_bus(), since in get_dimm_config() the
 variable "pvt->pci_ta" for KNL is also ready, we can simply use
 pci_read_config_dword(pvt->pci_ta, KNL_MCMTR, &pvt->info.mcmtr) to read
 MCMTR.
