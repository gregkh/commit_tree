tile: provide default ioremap declaration

Add a default ioremap function which was not provided in all
circumstances.  (Only when CONFIG_PCI and CONFIG_TILEGX was set).

I have designs to use them in scatterlist.c where they'd likely never be
called with this architecture, but it is needed to compile.  Thus, if
the function is ever hit it returns NULL.
