x86/mm: Remove the UP asm/tlbflush.h code, always use the (formerly) SMP code

The UP asm/tlbflush.h generates somewhat nicer code than the SMP version.
Aside from that, it's fallen quite a bit behind the SMP code:

 - flush_tlb_mm_range() didn't flush individual pages if the range
   was small.

 - The lazy TLB code was much weaker.  This usually wouldn't matter,
   but, if a kernel thread flushed its lazy "active_mm" more than
   once (due to reclaim or similar), it wouldn't be unlazied and
   would instead pointlessly flush repeatedly.

 - Tracepoints were missing.

Aside from that, simply having the UP code around was a maintanence
burden, since it means that any change to the TLB flush code had to
make sure not to break it.

Simplify everything by deleting the UP code.
