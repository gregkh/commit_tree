net: sched: introduce a TRAP control action

There is need to instruct the HW offloaded path to push certain matched
packets to cpu/kernel for further analysis. So this patch introduces a
new TRAP control action to TC.

For kernel datapath, this action does not make much sense. So with the
same logic as in HW, new TRAP behaves similar to STOLEN. The skb is just
dropped in the datapath (and virtually ejected to an upper level, which
does not exist in case of kernel).
