ARM: shmobile: rcar-gen2: Fix deadlock in regulator quirk

Simon Horman reported that Koelsch and Lager hang during boot, and
bisected this to commit 1c3c5eab171590f8 ("sched/core: Enable
might_sleep() and smp_processor_id() checks early").

The da9063/da9210 regulator quirk for R-Car Gen2 boards uses a bus
notifier, and unregisters the notifier when it is no longer needed.
However, a notifier must not be unregistered from within the call chain.

This bug went unnoticed, as blocking_notifier_chain_unregister() didn't
take the semaphore during early boot.  The aforementioned commit changed
that behavior, leading to a deadlock.

Fix this by removing the call to bus_unregister_notifier(), and keeping
local completion state instead.
