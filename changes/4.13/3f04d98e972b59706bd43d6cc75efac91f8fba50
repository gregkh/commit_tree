perf intel-pt: Improve sample timestamp

The decoder uses its current timestamp in samples. Usually that is a
timestamp that has already passed, but in some cases it is a timestamp
for a branch that the decoder is walking towards, and consequently
hasn't reached. Improve that situation by using the pkt_state to
determine when to use the current or previous timestamp.
