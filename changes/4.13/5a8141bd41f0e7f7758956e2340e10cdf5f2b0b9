usb: phy: phy-msm-usb: Fix usage of devm_regulator_bulk_get()

The regulator_bulk_data pointer passed to devm_regulator_bulk_get()
is used to store the client handles for the regulators, which
is later used by devm_regulator_bulk_release() to free the
regulators.
Passing a local array as is done here means the memory used to
store the handles is freed causing the handles to be corrupted,
resulting in a crash when devm_regulator_bulk_release() tries to
free them.

Fix this my moving the array inside of the msm_otg structure.
