drm/i915/skl: New ddb allocation algorithm

This patch implements new DDB allocation algorithm as per HW team
recommendation. This algo takecare of scenario where we allocate less DDB
for the planes with lower relative pixel rate, but they require more DDB
to work.
It also takes care of enabling same watermark level for each
plane in crtc, for efficient power saving.
