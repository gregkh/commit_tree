nvmet: preserve controller serial number between reboots

The NVMe target has no way to preserve controller serial
IDs across reboots which breaks udev scripts doing
SYMLINK+="dev/disk/by-id/nvme-$env{ID_SERIAL}-part%n.

Export the randomly generated serial number via configfs and allow
setting of a serial via configfs to mitigate this breakage.
