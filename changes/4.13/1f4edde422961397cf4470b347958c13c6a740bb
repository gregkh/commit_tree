MIPS: Rename `sigill_r6' to `sigill_r2r6' in `__compute_return_epc_for_insn'

Use the more accurate `sigill_r2r6' name for the label used in the case
of sending SIGILL in the absence of the instruction emulator for an
earlier ISA level instruction that has been removed as from the R6 ISA,
so that the `sigill_r6' name is freed for the situation where an R6
instruction is not supposed to be interpreted, because the executing
processor does not support the R6 ISA.
