netvsc: fix deadlock betwen link status and removal

There is a deadlock possible when canceling the link status
delayed work queue. The removal process is run with RTNL held,
and the link status callback is acquring RTNL.

Resolve the issue by using trylock and rescheduling.
If cancel is in process, that block it from happening.
