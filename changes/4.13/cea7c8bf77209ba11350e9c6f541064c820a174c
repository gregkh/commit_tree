btrfs: remove redundant null bdev counting during flush submission

There is no extra benefit to count null bdev during the submit loop,
as these null devices will be anyway checked during command
completion device loop just after the submit loop. We are holding the
device_list_mutex, the device->bdev status won't change in between.
