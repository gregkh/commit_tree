arc: Mask individual IRQ lines during core INTC init

ARC cores on reset have all interrupt lines of built-in INTC enabled.
Which means once we globally enable interrupts (very early on boot)
faulty hardware blocks may trigger an interrupt that Linux kernel
cannot handle yet as corresponding handler is not yet installed.

In that case system falls in "interrupt storm" and basically never
does anything useful except entering and exiting generic IRQ handling
code.

One real example of that kind of problematic hardware is DW GMAC which
also has interrupts enabled on reset and if Ethernet PHY informs GMAC
about link state, GMAC immediately reports that upstream to ARC core
and here we are.

Now with that change we mask all individual IRQ lines making entire
system more fool-proof.
