nvmet: Move serial number from controller to subsystem

The NVMe specification defines the serial number as:

"Serial Number (SN): Contains the serial number for the NVM subsystem
that is assigned by the vendor as an ASCII string. Refer to section
7.10 for unique identifier requirements. Refer to section 1.5 for ASCII
string requirements"

So move it from the controller to the subsystem, where it belongs.
