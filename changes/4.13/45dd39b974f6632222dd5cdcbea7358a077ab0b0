NFC: nfcmrvl: fix firmware-management initialisation

The nci-device was never deregistered in the event that
fw-initialisation failed.

Fix this by moving the firmware initialisation before device
registration since the firmware work queue should be available before
registering.

Note that this depends on a recent fix that moved device-name
initialisation back to to nci_allocate_device() as the
firmware-workqueue name is now derived from the nfc-device name.
