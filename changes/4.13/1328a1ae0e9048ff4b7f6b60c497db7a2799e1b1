kbuild: thin archives final link close --whole-archives option

Close the --whole-archives option with --no-whole-archive. Some
architectures end up including additional .o and files multiple
times after this, and they get duplicate symbols when they are
brought under the --whole-archives option.

This matches more closely with the incremental final link.
