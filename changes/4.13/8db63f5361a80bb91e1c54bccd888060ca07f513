pinctrl: stm32: select IRQ_DOMAIN_HIERARCHY instead of depends on

Drivers that need IRQ_DOMAIN_HIERARCHY should "select" it, but
drivers/pinctrl/stm32/Kconfig is the only exception that uses
"depends on" syntax.  This prevents GPIO drivers from select'ing
IRQ_DOMAIN_HIERARCHY.

For example, if I add "select IRQ_DOMAIN_HIERARCHY" to GPIO_XGENE_SB,
I get the following recursive dependency error.

drivers/gpio/Kconfig:13:error: recursive dependency detected!
