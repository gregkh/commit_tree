qed: Share additional information with qedf

Share several new tidbits with qedf:
 - wwpn & wwnn
 - Absolute pf-id [this one is actually meant for qedi as well]
 - Number of available CQs

While we're at it, now that qedf will be aware of the available CQs
we can add some validation on the inputs it provides.
