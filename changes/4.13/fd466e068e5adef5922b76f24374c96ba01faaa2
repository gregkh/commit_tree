randstruct: Whitelist struct security_hook_heads cast

The LSM initialization routines walk security_hook_heads as an array
of struct list_head instead of via names to avoid a ton of needless
source. Whitelist this to avoid the false positive warning from the
plugin:

security/security.c: In function ‘security_init’:
security/security.c:59:20: note: found mismatched op0 struct pointer types: ‘struct list_head’ and ‘struct security_hook_heads’

  struct list_head *list = (struct list_head *) &security_hook_heads;
                    ^
