blk-mq: don't stop queue for quiescing

Queue can be started by other blk-mq APIs and can be used in
different cases, this limits uses of blk_mq_quiesce_queue()
if it is based on stopping queue, and make its usage very
difficult, especially users have to use the stop queue APIs
carefully for avoiding to break blk_mq_quiesce_queue().

We have applied the QUIESCED flag for draining and blocking
dispatch, so it isn't necessary to stop queue any more.

After stopping queue is removed, blk_mq_quiesce_queue() can
be used safely and easily, then users won't worry about queue
restarting during quiescing at all.
