PNFS fix EACCESS on commit to DS handling

Commit fabbbee0eb0f "PNFS fix fallback to MDS if got error on
commit to DS" moved the pnfs_set_lo_fail() to unhandled errors
which was not correct and lead to a kernel oops on umount.

Instead, fix the original EACCESS on commit to DS error by
getting the new layout and re-doing the IO.
