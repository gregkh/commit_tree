drm/i915: Correctly enable backlight brightness adjustment via DPCD

intel_dp_aux_enable_backlight() assumed that the register
BACKLIGHT_BRIGHTNESS_CONTROL_MODE can only has value 01
(DP_EDP_BACKLIGHT_CONTROL_MODE_PRESET) when initialize.

This patch fixed that by handling all cases of that register.
