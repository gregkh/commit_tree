irqdomain: Let irq_domain_mapping display hierarchical domains

Hierarchical domains seem to be hard to grasp, and a number of
aspiring kernel hackers find them utterly discombobulating.

In order to ease their pain, let's make them appear in
/sys/kernel/debug/irq_domain_mapping, such as the following:

   96  0x81808  MSI    0x          (null) RADIX   MSI
   96+ 0x00063  GICv2m 0xffff8003ee116980 RADIX   GICv2m
   96+ 0x00063  GICv2  0xffff00000916bfd8 LINEAR  GICv2

[output compressed to fit in a commit log]

This shows that IRQ96 is implemented by a stack of three domains,
the + sign indicating the stacking.
