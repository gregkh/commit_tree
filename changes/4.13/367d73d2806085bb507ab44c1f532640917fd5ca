drm/i915: Always recompute watermarks when distrust_bios_wm is set, v2.

On some systems there can be a race condition in which no crtc state is

null DDB allocation, causing a FIFO underrun on any update until the
first modeset.

Changes since v1:
- Do not take the connection_mutex, this is already done below.
