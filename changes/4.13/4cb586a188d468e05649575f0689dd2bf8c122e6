tpm_tis: Consolidate the platform and acpi probe flow

Now that the platform device was merged for OF support we can use the
platform device to match ACPI devices as well and run everything
through tpm_tis_init.

pnp_acpi_device is replaced with ACPI_COMPANION, and ACPI_HANDLE is
pushed further down.

platform_get_resource is used instead of acpi_dev_get_resources.

The itpm global module parameter is no longer changed during itpm
detection, instead the phy specific bit is set directly.
