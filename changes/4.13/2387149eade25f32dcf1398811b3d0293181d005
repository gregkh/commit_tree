KVM: improve arch vcpu request defining

Marc Zyngier suggested that we define the arch specific VCPU request
base, rather than requiring each arch to remember to start from 8.
That suggestion, along with Radim Krcmar's recent VCPU request flag
addition, snowballed into defining something of an arch VCPU request
defining API.

No functional change.

(Looks like x86 is running out of arch VCPU request bits.  Maybe
 someday we'll need to extend to 64.)
