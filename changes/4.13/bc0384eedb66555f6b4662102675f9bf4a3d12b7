qtnfmac: check band before allocating cmd_skb to avoid resource leak

The current code allocates cmd_skb and then will leak this if band->band
is an illegal value. It is simpler to sanity check the band first before
allocating cmd_skb so that we don't have to free cmd_skb if an invalid
band occurs.
