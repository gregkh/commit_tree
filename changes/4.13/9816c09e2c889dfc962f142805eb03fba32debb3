dmaengine: omap-dma: port_window support correction for both direction

When the port_window support was verified it was done on setup where only
the MEM_TO_DEV direction was enabled. This got un-noticed and thus only
this direction worked.

Now that I have managed to get a setup to verify both direction it turned
out that the setup was incorrect:
omap_desc members are settings for the slave port while the omap_sg members
apply to the memory side of the sDMA setup.
