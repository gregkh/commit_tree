xfs: Don't clear SGID when inheriting ACLs

When new directory 'DIR1' is created in a directory 'DIR0' with SGID bit
set, DIR1 is expected to have SGID bit set (and owning group equal to
the owning group of 'DIR0'). However when 'DIR0' also has some default
ACLs that 'DIR1' inherits, setting these ACLs will result in SGID bit on
'DIR1' to get cleared if user is not member of the owning group.

Fix the problem by calling __xfs_set_acl() instead of xfs_set_acl() when
setting up inode in xfs_generic_create(). That prevents SGID bit
clearing and mode is properly set by posix_acl_create() anyway. We also
reorder arguments of __xfs_set_acl() to match the ordering of
xfs_set_acl() to make things consistent.
