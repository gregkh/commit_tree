target/tcm_loop: Make TMF processing slightly faster

Target drivers must guarantee that struct se_cmd and struct se_tmr_req
exist as long as target_tmr_work() is in progress. This is why the
tcm_loop driver today passes 1 as second argument to
transport_generic_free_cmd() from inside the TMF code. Instead of
making the TMF code wait, make the TMF code obtain two references
(SCF_ACK_KREF) and drop one reference from inside the .check_stop_free()
callback.
