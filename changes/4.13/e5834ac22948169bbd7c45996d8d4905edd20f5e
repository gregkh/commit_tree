NFC: nfcmrvl: use nfc-device for firmware download

Use the nfc- rather than phy-device in firmware-management code that
needs a valid struct device.

This specifically fixes a NULL-pointer dereference in
nfcmrvl_fw_dnld_init() during registration when the underlying tty is
one end of a Unix98 pty.

Note that the driver still uses the phy device for any debugging, which
is fine for now.
