Input: gpio_keys - handle the missing key press event in resume phase

The GPIO key press event might be missed in the resume phase, if the key
had been released before the system had been resumed to the stage that it
could capture the press event. So we simulate the wakeup key press event
in case the key had been released by the time we got interrupt handler
to run.
