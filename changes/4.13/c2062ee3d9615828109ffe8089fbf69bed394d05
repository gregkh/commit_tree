net: systemport: Free DMA coherent descriptors on errors

In case bcm_sysport_init_tx_ring() is not able to allocate ring->cbs, we
would return with an error, and call bcm_sysport_fini_tx_ring() and it
would see that ring->cbs is NULL and do nothing. This would leak the
coherent DMA descriptor area, so we need to free it on error before
returning.
