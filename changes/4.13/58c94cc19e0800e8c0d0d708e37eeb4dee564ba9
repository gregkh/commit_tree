block: don't check for BIO_MAX_PAGES in blk_bio_segment_split()

blk_bio_segment_split() makes sure bios have no more than
BIO_MAX_PAGES entries in the bi_io_vec.
This was done because bio_clone_bioset() (when given a
mempool bioset) could not handle larger io_vecs.

No driver uses bio_clone_bioset() any more, they all
use bio_clone_fast() if anything, and bio_clone_fast()
doesn't clone the bi_io_vec.

The main user of of bio_clone_bioset() at this level
is bounce.c, and bouncing now happens before blk_bio_segment_split(),
so that is not of concern.

So remove the big helpful comment and the code.
