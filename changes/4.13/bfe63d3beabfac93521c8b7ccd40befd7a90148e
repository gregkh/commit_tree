mm: drop page_initialized check from get_nid_for_pfn

Commit c04fc586c1a4 ("mm: show node to memory section relationship with
symlinks in sysfs") has added means to export memblock<->node
association into the sysfs.  It has also introduced get_nid_for_pfn
which is a rather confusing counterpart of pfn_to_nid which checks also
whether the pfn page is already initialized (page_initialized).

This is done by checking page::lru != NULL which doesn't make any sense
at all.  Nothing in this path really relies on the lru list being used
or initialized.  Just remove it because this will become a problem with
later patches.

Thanks to Reza Arbab for testing which revealed this to be a problem
