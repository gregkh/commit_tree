drm/i915/perf: remove perf.hook_lock

In earlier iterations of the i915-perf driver we had a number of
callbacks/hooks from other parts of the i915 driver to e.g. notify us
when a legacy context was pinned and these could run asynchronously with
respect to the stream file operations and might also run in atomic
context.

dev_priv->perf.hook_lock had been for serialising access to state needed
within these callbacks, but as the code has evolved some of the hooks
have gone away or are implemented to avoid needing to lock any state.

The remaining use of this lock was actually redundant considering how
the gen7 oacontrol state used to be updated as part of a context pin
hook.
