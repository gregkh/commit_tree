net: ena: add hardware hints capability to the driver

With this patch, ENA device can update the ena driver about
the desired timeout values:
These values are part of the "hardware hints" which are transmitted
to the driver as Asynchronous event through ENA async
event notification queue.

In case the ENA device does not support this capability,
the driver will use its own default values.
