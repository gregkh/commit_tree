net: sched: introduce multichain support for filters

Instead of having only one filter per block, introduce a list of chains
for every block. Create chain 0 by default. UAPI is extended so the user
can specify which chain he wants to change. If the new attribute is not
specified, chain 0 is used. That allows to maintain backward
compatibility. If chain does not exist and user wants to manipulate with
it, new chain is created with specified index. Also, when last filter is
removed from the chain, the chain is destroyed.
