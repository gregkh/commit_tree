powerpc: don't fortify prom_init

prom_init is a bit special; in theory it should be able to be linked
separately to the kernel.  To keep this from getting too complex, the
symbols that prom_init.c uses are checked.

Fortification adds symbols, and it gets quite messy as it includes
things like panic().  So just don't fortify prom_init.c for now.
