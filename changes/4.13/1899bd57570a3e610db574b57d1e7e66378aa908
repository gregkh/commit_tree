drm/exynos: forbid creating framebuffers from too small GEM buffers

Add a check if the framebuffer described by the provided drm_mode_fb_cmd2
structure fits into provided GEM buffers. Without this check it is
possible to create a framebuffer object from a small buffer and set it to
the hardware, what results in displaying system memory outside the
allocated GEM buffer.
