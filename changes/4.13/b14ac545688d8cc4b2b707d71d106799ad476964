[media] coda: improve colorimetry handling

The hardware codec is not colorspace aware. We should trust userspace to
set the correct colorimetry information on the OUTPUT queue and mirror
the exact same setting on the CAPTURE queue.

There is no reason to restrict colorspace to JPEG or REC709 only. Also,
set the default colorspace, as returned by calling VIDIOC_TRY/S_FMT with
V4L2_COLORSPACE_DEFAULT, initially.
