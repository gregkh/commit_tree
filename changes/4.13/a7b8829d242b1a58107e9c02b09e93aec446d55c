iio: accel: st_accel: add SPI-3wire support

Add SPI Serial Interface Mode (SIM) register information
in st_sensor_settings look up table to support devices
(like LSM303AGR accel sensor) that allow just SPI-3wire
communication mode. SIM mode has to be configured before any
other operation since it is not enabled by default and the driver
is not able to read without that configuration

Whilst a fairly substantial patch, the actual logic is simple and it
is better to have the generic fix than a band aid.
