ixgbe: always call setup_mac_link for multispeed fiber

Remove the logic which would previously skip the link configuration
in the case where we are already at the requested speed in
ixgbe_setup_mac_link_multispeed_fiber().

By exiting early we are skipping the link configuration and as such
the driver may not always configure the PHY correctly for SFP+.
