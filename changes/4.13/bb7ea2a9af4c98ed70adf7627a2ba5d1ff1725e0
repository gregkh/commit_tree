tools/lib/lockdep: Fix 'unused value' warnings

liblockdep defines various macros that may expand to an expression
with no effect, while the in-kernel definition does have an effect.
This results in warnings from gcc when -Wunused-value is enabled, and
is is enabled by -Wall.  Fix this by introducing trivial functions,
as function return values are generally allowed to be ignored.
