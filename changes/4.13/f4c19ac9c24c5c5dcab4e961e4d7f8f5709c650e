thermal: int340x_thermal: Switch to use new generic UUID API

There are new types and helpers that are supposed to be used in
new code.

As a preparation to get rid of legacy types and API functions do
the conversion here.

The conversion fixes a potential bug in int340x_thermal as well
since we have to use memcmp() on binary data.
