xfs: fix quotacheck dquot id overflow infinite loop

If a dquot has an id of U32_MAX, the next lookup index increment
overflows the uint32_t back to 0. This starts the lookup sequence
over from the beginning, repeats indefinitely and results in a
livelock.

Update xfs_qm_dquot_walk() to explicitly check for the lookup
overflow and exit the loop.
