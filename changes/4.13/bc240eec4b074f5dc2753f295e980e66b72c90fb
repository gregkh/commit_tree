ntb: use correct mw_count function in ntb_tool and ntb_transport

After converting to the new API, both ntb_tool and ntb_transport are
using ntb_mw_count to iterate through ntb_peer_get_addr when they
should be using ntb_peer_mw_count.

This probably isn't an issue with the Intel and AMD drivers but
this will matter for any future driver with asymetric memory window
counts.
