mtd: nand: denali: fix bank reset function to detect the number of chips

The nand_scan_ident() iterates over maxchips, and calls nand_reset()
for each.  This driver currently passes the maximum number of banks
(=chip selects) supported by the controller as maxchips.  So, maxchips
is typically 4 or 8.  Usually, less number of NAND chips are connected
to the controller.

This can be a problem for ONFi devices.  Now, this driver implements
->setup_data_interface() hook, so nand_setup_data_interface() issues
Set Features (0xEF) command, which waits until the chip returns R/B#
response.  If no chip there, we know it never happens, but the driver
still ends up with waiting for a long time.  It will finally bail-out
with timeout error and the driver will work with existing chips, but
unnecessary wait will give a bad user experience.

The denali_nand_reset() polls the INTR__RST_COMP and INTR__TIME_OUT
bits, but they are always set even if not NAND chip is connected to
that bank.  To know the chip existence, INTR__INT_ACT bit must be
checked; this flag is set only when R/B# is toggled.  Since the Reset
(0xFF) command toggles the R/B# pin, this can be used to know the
actual number of chips, and update denali->max_banks.
