cros_ec: Don't signal wake event for non-wake host events

The subset of wake-enabled host events is defined by the EC, but the EC
may still send non-wake host events if we're in the process of
suspending. Get the mask of wake-enabled host events from the EC and
filter out non-wake events to prevent spurious aborted suspend
attempts.
