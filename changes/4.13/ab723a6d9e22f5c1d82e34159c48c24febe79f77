ARM: dts: omap3-overo: Remove "vqmmc-supply" property from MMC dt node

commit 94647a30124e2c7 ("ARM: dts: omap3-overo: Enable WiFi/BT combo")
while enabling WiFi/BT combo added regulator to trigger the nReset
signal of the Bluetooth module in vqmmc-supply. However BT should be
handled by UART. Moreover "vqmmc" is not a defined binding for
omap_hsmmc. While "vqmmc" in mmc2 hasn't caused any issues so far,
mmc2 will start to mis-behave once omap_hsmmc defines "vqmmc"
binding.

Remove "vqmmc-supply" property in mmc2 here.
