IB/ipoib: Notify on modify QP failure only when relevant

Modify QP can fail and it can be acceptable, like when moving from RST to
ERR state, all the rest are not acceptable and a message to the log
should be printed.

The current code prints on all failures and many messages like:
"Failed to modify QP to ERROR state" appear, even when supported by the
state machine of the QP object.
