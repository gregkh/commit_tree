staging: speakup: make ttyio synths use device name

This patch introduces new module parameter, dev, which takes a string
representing the device that the external synth is connected to, e.g.
ttyS0, ttyUSB0 etc. This is then used to communicate with the synth.
That way, speakup can support more than ttyS*. As of this patch, it
only supports ttyS*, ttyUSB* and selected synths for lp*. dev parameter
is only available for tty-migrated synths.

Users will either use dev or ser as both serve same purpose. This patch
maintains backward compatility by allowing ser to be specified. When
both are specified, whichever is non-default, i.e. not ttyS0, is used.
If both are non-default then dev is used.
