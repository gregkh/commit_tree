s390/diag: add diag26c support

Implement support for the hypervisor diagnose 0x26c
('Access Certain System Information').
It passes a request buffer and a subfunction code, and receives
a response buffer and a return code.

Also add the scaffolding for the 'MAC Services' subfunction.
It may be used by network devices to obtain a hypervisor-managed
MAC address.
