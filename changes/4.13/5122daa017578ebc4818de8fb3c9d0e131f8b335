x86/platform/uv/BAU: Minor cleanup, make some local functions static

The functions handle_uv2_busy, uv_flush_send_and_wait and
find_another_by_swack are local to the source, so make them static.

Also remove normal_busy as it is no longer used.

Fixes various smatch warnings, such as:
"symbol 'find_another_by_swack' was not declared. Should it be static?"
"symbol 'handle_uv2_busy' was not declared. Should it be static?"
