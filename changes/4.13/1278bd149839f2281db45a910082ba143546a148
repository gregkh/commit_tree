brcmfmac: Use separate firmware for revision 0 of the brcm43430 chip

The brcm43430 chip needs different firmware files for chip revision 0
and 1. The file currently in linux-firmware is for revision 1 only.

This commit makes brcmfmac request brcmfmac43430a0-sdio.bin instead
of brcmfmac43430-sdio.bin for revision 0 chips.

Note that the behavior for revision 1 chips is not changed, ideally those
would load brcmfmac43430a1-sdio.bin, but that will break existing setups.
