drm/i915/perf: avoid read back of head register

There's no need for the driver to keep reading back the head pointer
from hardware since the hardware doesn't update it automatically. This
way we can treat any invalid head pointer value as a software/driver
bug instead of spurious hardware behaviour.

This change is also a small stepping stone towards re-working how
the head and tail state is managed as part of an improved workaround
for the tail register race condition.
