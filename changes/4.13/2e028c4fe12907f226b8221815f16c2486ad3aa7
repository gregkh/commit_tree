ftrace: Fix uninitialized variable in match_records()

My static checker complains that if "func" is NULL then "clear_filter"
is uninitialized.  This seems like it could be true, although it's
possible something subtle is happening that I haven't seen.

    kernel/trace/ftrace.c:3844 match_records()
    error: uninitialized symbol 'clear_filter'.
