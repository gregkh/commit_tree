rsi: add in missing RSI_FSM_STATES into array fsm_state

Two recent commits added new RSI_FSM_STATES (namely FSM_FW_NOT_LOADED
and FSM_COMMON_DEV_PARAMS_SENT) and the corresponding table fsm_state
was not updated to match. This can lead to an array overrun when
accessing the latter two states in fsm_state. Fix this by adding in
the missing states.
