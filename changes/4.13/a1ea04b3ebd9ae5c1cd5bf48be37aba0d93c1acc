scsi: cxlflash: Flush pending commands in cleanup path

When the AFU is reset in an error path, pending scsi commands can be
silently dropped without completion or a formal abort. This puts the onus
on the cxlflash driver to notify mid-layer and indicating that the command
can be retried.

Once the card has been quiesced, the hardware send queue lock is acquired
to prevent any data movement while the pending commands are processed.
