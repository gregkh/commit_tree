dma-coherent: introduce interface for default DMA pool

Christoph noticed [1] that default DMA pool in current form overload
the DMA coherent infrastructure. In reply, Robin suggested [2] to
split the per-device vs. global pool interfaces, so allocation/release
from default DMA pool is driven by dma ops implementation.

This patch implements Robin's idea and provide interface to
allocate/release/mmap the default (aka global) DMA pool.

To make it clear that existing *_from_coherent routines work on
per-device pool rename them to *_from_dev_coherent.
