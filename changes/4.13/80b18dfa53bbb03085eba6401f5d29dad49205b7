ksm: optimize refile of stable_node_dup at the head of the chain

If a candidate stable_node_dup has been found and it can accept further
merges it can be refiled to the head of the list to speedup next
searches without altering which dup is found and how the dups accumulate
in the chain.

We already refiled it back to the head in the prune_stale_stable_nodes
case, but we didn't refile it if not pruning (which is more common).
And we also refiled it when it was already at the head which is
unnecessary (in the prune_stale_stable_nodes case, nr > 1 means there's
more than one dup in the chain, it doesn't mean it's not already at the
head of the chain).

The stable_node_chain list is single threaded and there's no SMP locking
contention so it should be faster to refile it to the head of the list
also if prune_stale_stable_nodes is false.

Profiling shows the refile happens 1.9% of the time when a dup is found
with a max_page_sharing limit setting of 3 (with max_page_sharing of 2
the refile never happens of course as there's never space for one more
merge) which is reasonably low.  At higher max_page_sharing values it
should be much less frequent.

This is just an optimization.
