ARM: HP Jornada 7XX: move inline before return type

Convert 'u8 inline' to 'inline u8' to be the same style used by the rest
of the kernel.

Miscellanea:

jornada_ssp_reverse is an odd function.
It is declared inline but is also EXPORT_SYMBOL.
It is also apparently only used by jornada720_ssp.c
Likely the EXPORT_SYMBOL could be removed and the function
converted to static.

The addition of static and removal of EXPORT_SYMBOL was not done.
