platform/x86: wmi: Incorporate acpi_install_notify_handler

As a platform driver, acpi_driver.notify will not be available,
so use acpi_install_notify_handler as we will be converting to a
platform driver.

This gives event drivers a simple way to handle events. It
also seems closer to what the Windows docs suggest that Windows
does: it sounds like, in Windows, the mapper is responsible for
called _WED before dispatching to the subdriver.
