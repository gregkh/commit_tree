ima: define a set of appraisal rules requiring file signatures

The builtin "ima_appraise_tcb" policy should require file signatures for
at least a few of the hooks (eg. kernel modules, firmware, and the kexec
kernel image), but changing it would break the existing userspace/kernel
ABI.

This patch defines a new builtin policy named "secure_boot", which
can be specified on the "ima_policy=" boot command line, independently
or in conjunction with the "ima_appraise_tcb" policy, by specifing
ima_policy="appraise_tcb | secure_boot".  The new appraisal rules
requiring file signatures will be added prior to the "ima_appraise_tcb"
rules.

- Reference secure boot in the new builtin policy name. (Thiago Bauermann)
