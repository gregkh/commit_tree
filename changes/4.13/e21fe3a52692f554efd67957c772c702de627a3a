scsi: hisi_sas: add initialisation for v3 pci-based controller

Add the code to initialise the controller which is based on pci device
in hisi_sas_v3_hw.c

The core controller routines are still in hisi_sas_main.c; some common
initialisation functions are also exported from hisi_sas_main.c

For pci-based controller, the device properties, like phy count and sas
address are read from the firmware, same as platform device-based
controller.
