ptp: dte: Use LL suffix for 64-bit constants

With gcc 4.1.2:

    drivers/ptp/ptp_dte.c: In function ‘dte_write_nco_delta’:
    drivers/ptp/ptp_dte.c:105: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type
    drivers/ptp/ptp_dte.c:112: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type
    drivers/ptp/ptp_dte.c:114: warning: integer constant is too large for ‘long’ type

Add the missing "LL" suffix to fix this.
