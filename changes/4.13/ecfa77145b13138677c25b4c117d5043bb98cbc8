dmaengine: mv_xor_v2: add support for suspend/resume

This commit adds the support for suspend/resume in the mv_xor_v2
driver. The suspend suspend function disables the XOR engine after the
DMA stack has handled all pending descriptors in the queue. The resume
function re-configures the XOR engine and re-enables the engine.
