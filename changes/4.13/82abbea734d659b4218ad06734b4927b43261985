MAINTAINERS: fix alphabetical ordering

Fix major alphabetic errors.  No attempt to fix items that all begin
with the same word (like ARM, BROADCOM, DRM, EDAC, FREESCALE, INTEL,
OMAP, PCI, SAMSUNG, TI, USB, etc.).

(diffstat +/- is different by one line because TI KEYSTONE MULTICORE
had 2 blank lines after it.)
