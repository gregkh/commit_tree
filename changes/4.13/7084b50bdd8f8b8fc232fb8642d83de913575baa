drm/i915/skl+: calculate pixel_rate & relative_data_rate in fixed point

This patch make changes to calculate adjusted plane pixel rate &
plane downscale amount using fixed_point functions available.
This patch will give uniformity in code, & will help to avoid mixing of
32bit uint32_t variable for fixed-16.16 with fixed_16_16_t variables in
later patch in the series.

Changes from V1:
 - Rebase based on wrapper name change
 - Remove unnecessary comment
