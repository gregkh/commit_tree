ftgmac100: return error in ftgmac100_alloc_rx_buf

The error paths set err, but it's not returned.

I wondered if we should fix all of the callers to check the returned
value, but Ben explains why the code is this way:

> Most call sites ignore it on purpose. There's nothing we can do if
> we fail to get a buffer at interrupt time, so we point the buffer to
> the scratch page so the HW doesn't DMA into lalaland and lose the
> packet.

> The one call site that tests and can fail is the one used when brining
> the interface up. If we fail to allocate at that point, we fail the
> ifup. But as you noticed, I do have a bug not returning the error.
