mnt: In propgate_umount handle visiting mounts in any order

While investigating some poor umount performance I realized that in
the case of overlapping mount trees where some of the mounts are locked
the code has been failing to unmount all of the mounts it should
have been unmounting.

This failure to unmount all of the necessary
mounts can be reproduced with:

$ cat locked_mounts_test.sh

mount -t tmpfs test-base /mnt
mount --make-shared /mnt
mkdir -p /mnt/b

mount -t tmpfs test1 /mnt/b
mount --make-shared /mnt/b
mkdir -p /mnt/b/10

mount -t tmpfs test2 /mnt/b/10
mount --make-shared /mnt/b/10
mkdir -p /mnt/b/10/20

mount --rbind /mnt/b /mnt/b/10/20

unshare -Urm --propagation unchaged /bin/sh -c 'sleep 5; if [ $(grep test /proc/self/mountinfo | wc -l) -eq 1 ] ; then echo SUCCESS ; else echo FAILURE ; fi'
sleep 1
umount -l /mnt/b
wait %%

$ unshare -Urm ./locked_mounts_test.sh

This failure is corrected by removing the prepass that marks mounts
that may be umounted.

A first pass is added that umounts mounts if possible and if not sets
mount mark if they could be unmounted if they weren't locked and adds
them to a list to umount possibilities.  This first pass reconsiders
the mounts parent if it is on the list of umount possibilities, ensuring
that information of umoutability will pass from child to mount parent.

A second pass then walks through all mounts that are umounted and processes
their children unmounting them or marking them for reparenting.

A last pass cleans up the state on the mounts that could not be umounted
and if applicable reparents them to their first parent that remained
mounted.

While a bit longer than the old code this code is much more robust
as it allows information to flow up from the leaves and down
from the trunk making the order in which mounts are encountered
in the umount propgation tree irrelevant.
