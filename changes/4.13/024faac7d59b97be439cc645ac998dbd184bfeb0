drm/i915: Support variable cursor height on ivb+

IVB introduced the CUR_FBC_CTL register which allows reducing the cursor
height down to 8 lines from the otherwise square cursor dimensions.
Implement support for it. CUR_FBC_CTL can't be used when the cursor
is rotated.

Commandeer the otherwise unused cursor->cursor.size to track the
current value of CUR_FBC_CTL to optimize away redundant CUR_FBC_CTL
writes, and to notice when we need to arm the update via CURBASE if
just CUR_FBC_CTL changes.

v2: Reverse the gen check to make it sane
v3: Only enable CUR_FBC_CTL when cursor is enabled, adapt to
    earlier code changes which means we now actually turn off
    the cursor when we're supposed to unlike v2
v4: Add a comment about rotation vs. CUR_FBC_CTL,
    rebase due to 'dirty' (Chris)
v5: Rebase to the atomic world
    Handle 180 degree rotation
    Add HAS_CUR_FBC()
v6: Rebase
v7: Rebase due to I915_WRITE_FW/uncore.lock
