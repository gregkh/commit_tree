arm64: signal: factor frame layout and population into separate passes

In preparation for expanding the signal frame, this patch refactors
the signal frame setup code in setup_sigframe() into two separate
passes.

The first pass, setup_sigframe_layout(), determines the size of the
signal frame and its internal layout, including the presence and
location of optional records.  The resulting knowledge is used to
allocate and locate the user stack space required for the signal
frame and to determine which optional records to include.

The second pass, setup_sigframe(), is called once the stack frame
is allocated in order to populate it with the necessary context
information.

As a result of these changes, it becomes more natural to represent
locations in the signal frame by a base pointer and an offset,
since the absolute address of each location is not known during the
layout pass.  To be more consistent with this logic,
parse_user_sigframe() is refactored to describe signal frame
locations in a similar way.

This change has no effect on the signal ABI, but will make it
easier to expand the signal frame in future patches.
