RDMA/bnxt_re: Report supported value to IB stack in query_device

- Report supported value for max_mr_size to IB stack in query_device.
   Also, check and log if MR size requested by application in
   reg_user_mr() is greater than value currently supported by driver.
 - Report only 4K page size support for now
 - Fix Max_QP value returned by ibv_devinfo -vv.
   In case of PF, FW reserves 129 QPs for creating QP1s of VFs
   and PF. So the max_qp value reported by FW for PF doesn'tt include
   the QP1. Fixing this issue by adding 1 with the value reported
   by FW.
