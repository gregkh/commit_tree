iwlwifi: mvm: properly enable IP header checksumming

The code was intended to enable IP header checksumming on AMSDUs, but
failed to really do so because the A-MSDU bit was set after all the
checksumming bits, and thus checking for A-MSDU could never be true.

Fix this by setting the A-MSDU bit before the offload bits.
