drm/i915: Clear lost context-switch interrupts across reset

During a global reset, we disable the irq. As we disable the irq, the
hardware may be raising a GT interrupt that we then ignore, leaving it
pending in the GTIIR. After the reset, we then re-enable the irq,
triggering the pending interrupt. However, that interrupt was for the
stale state from before the reset, and the contents of the CSB buffer
are now invalid.

v2: Add a comment to make it clear that the double clear is purely my
paranoia.
