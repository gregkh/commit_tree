ASoC: Drop invalid DMI fields when setting card long name from DMI info

Sometimes DMI fields may be invalid and so can't give useful vendor,
product or board info, such as "Type2 - Board Manufacturer" or
"Type1 - TBD by OEM". Including such invalid DMI fileds may create silly
card long name. So this patch creates a black list of invalid strings.
And if a DMI field contains any string in this list, it will be excluded
from the card long name.
