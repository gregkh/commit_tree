udp: call dst_hold_safe() in udp_sk_rx_set_dst()

In udp_v4/6_early_demux() code, we try to hold dst->__refcnt for
dst with DST_NOCACHE flag. This is because later in udp_sk_rx_dst_set()
function, we will try to cache this dst in sk for connected case.
However, a better way to achieve this is to not try to hold dst in
early_demux(), but in udp_sk_rx_dst_set(), call dst_hold_safe(). This
approach is also more consistant with how tcp is handling it. And it
will make later changes simpler.
