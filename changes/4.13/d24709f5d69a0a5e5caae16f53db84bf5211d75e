pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7794: Remove AVB_AVTP_* groups

The ATA_AVTP_* signals are documented as reserved in the recent R-Car E2
user's manual (the only remaining mention is in the table 5.2 and I believe
it's a simple overlook).  Remove the AVB_AVTP_* pinmux groups -- we will
remove the signals themselves in the next patch, along with the other now
reserved bits...
