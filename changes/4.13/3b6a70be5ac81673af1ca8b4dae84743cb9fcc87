ACPI / x86: Allow matching always_present_id array entries by DMI

On some x86 systems the DSDT hides APCI devices to work around Windows
driver bugs. On one such system the device is even hidden until a certain
time after _SB.PCI0.GFX0.LCD.LCD1._ON gets called has passed *and*
_STA has been called at least 3 times since. TL;DR: it is a mess.

Until now the always_present_id matching was used to force status
for a whole class of devices, e.g. always enable PWM1 on CHerry Trail
devices.

This commit extends the always_present_id matching code to optionally
also check for a DMI match so that we can also add system specific
quirks to the always_present_id array.
