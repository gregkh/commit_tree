KVM: arm/arm64: Allow setting the timer IRQ numbers from userspace

First we define an ABI using the vcpu devices that lets userspace set
the interrupt numbers for the various timers on both the 32-bit and
64-bit KVM/ARM implementations.

Second, we add the definitions for the groups and attributes introduced
by the above ABI.  (We add the PMU define on the 32-bit side as well for
symmetry and it may get used some day.)

Third, we set up the arch-specific vcpu device operation handlers to
call into the timer code for anything related to the
KVM_ARM_VCPU_TIMER_CTRL group.

Fourth, we implement support for getting and setting the timer interrupt
numbers using the above defined ABI in the arch timer code.

Fifth, we introduce error checking upon enabling the arch timer (which
is called when first running a VCPU) to check that all VCPUs are
configured to use the same PPI for the timer (as mandated by the
architecture) and that the virtual and physical timers are not
configured to use the same IRQ number.
