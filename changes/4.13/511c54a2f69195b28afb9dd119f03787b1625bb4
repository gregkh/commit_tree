CIFS: Reconnect expired SMB sessions

According to the MS-SMB2 spec (3.2.5.1.6) once the client receives
STATUS_NETWORK_SESSION_EXPIRED error code from a server it should
reconnect the current SMB session. Currently the client doesn't do
that. This can result in subsequent client requests failing by
the server. The patch adds an additional logic to the demultiplex
thread to identify expired sessions and reconnect them.
