pinctrl: meson-gxbb: remove non-existing pin GPIOX_22

After commit 34e61801a3b9 "pinctrl: meson-gxbb: Add missing GPIODV_18
pin entry" I started to get the following warning:

"meson-pinctrl c8834000.periphs:pinctrl@4b0: names 119 do not match
number of GPIOs 120"

It turned out that not the mentioned commit has a problem, it just
revealed another problem which had existed before.

There is no PIN GPIOX_22 on Meson GXBB.
