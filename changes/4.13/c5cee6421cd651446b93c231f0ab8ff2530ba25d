powerpc/mm/hash: Do a local flush if possible when no batch is active

Currently in hpte_need_flush() if there is no batch pending we always do a
global TLB flush, which is inefficient if the mm has never run on another
thread.

Instead do the same check that __flush_tlb_pending() does and check if a local
flush is sufficient when batch->active is false. Instead of open-coding it we
use mm_is_thread_local().
