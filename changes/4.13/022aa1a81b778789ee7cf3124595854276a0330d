coresight: Fix reference count for software sources

For software sources (i.e STM), there could be multiple agents
generating the trace data, unlike the ETMs. So we need to
properly do the accounting for the active number of users
to disable the device when the last user goes away. Right
now, the reference counting is broken for sources as we skip
the actions when we detect that the source is enabled.

This patch fixes the problem by adding the refcounting for
software sources, even when they are enabled.
