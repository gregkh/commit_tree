drm/prime: Introduce drm_gem_prime_import_dev

The existing drm_gem_prime_import function uses the underlying
struct device of a drm_device for attaching to a dma_buf. Some drivers
(notably vgem) may not have an underlying device structure. Offer
an alternate function to attach using any available device structure.
