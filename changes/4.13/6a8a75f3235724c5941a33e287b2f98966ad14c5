Revert "perf/core: Drop kernel samples even though :u is specified"

This reverts commit cc1582c231ea041fbc68861dfaf957eaf902b829.

This commit introduced a regression that broke rr-project, which uses sampling
events to receive a signal on overflow (but does not care about the contents
of the sample). These signals are critical to the correct operation of rr.

There's been some back and forth about how to fix it - but to not keep
applications in limbo queue up a revert.
