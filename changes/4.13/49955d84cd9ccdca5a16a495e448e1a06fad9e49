MIPS: Save static registers before sysmips

The MIPS sysmips system call handler may return directly from the
MIPS_ATOMIC_SET case (mips_atomic_set()) to syscall_exit. This path
restores the static (callee saved) registers, however they won't have
been saved on entry to the system call.

Use the save_static_function() macro to create a __sys_sysmips wrapper
function which saves the static registers before calling sys_sysmips, so
that the correct static register state is restored by syscall_exit.
