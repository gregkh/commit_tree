test_sysctl: add generic script to expand on tests

This adds a generic script to let us more easily add more tests cases.
Since we really have only two types of tests cases just fold them into
the one file.  Each test unit is now identified into its separate
function:

    # ./sysctl.sh -l
  Test ID list:

  TEST_ID x NUM_TEST
  TEST_ID:   Test ID
  NUM_TESTS: Number of recommended times to run the test

  0001 x 1 - tests proc_dointvec_minmax()
  0002 x 1 - tests proc_dostring()

For now we start off with what we had before, and run only each test
once.  We can now watch a test case until it fails:

  ./sysctl.sh -w 0002

We can also run a test case x number of times, say we want to run a test
case 100 times:

  ./sysctl.sh -c 0001 100

To run a test case only once, for example:

  ./sysctl.sh -s 0002

The default settings are specified at the top of sysctl.sh.
