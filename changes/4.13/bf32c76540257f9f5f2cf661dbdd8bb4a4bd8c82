rcu: Convert rnp->lock wrappers to macros for SRCU use

Use of smp_mb__after_unlock_lock() would allow SRCU to omit a full
memory barrier during callback execution, so this commit converts
raw_spin_lock_rcu_node() from inline functions to type-generic macros
to allow them to handle locks in srcu_node structures as well as
rcu_node structures.
