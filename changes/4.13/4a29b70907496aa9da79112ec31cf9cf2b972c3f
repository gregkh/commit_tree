[media] vimc: Subdevices as modules

Change the core structure for adding subdevices in the topology.
Instead of calling the specific create function for each subdevice,
inject a child platform_device with the driver's name.
Each type of node in the topology (sensor, capture, debayer, scaler)
will register a platform_driver with the corresponding name through the
component subsystem.
Implementing a new subdevice type doesn't require vimc-core to be altered.

This facilitates future implementation of dynamic entities, where
hotpluging an entity in the topology is just a matter of
registering/unregistering a platform_device in the system.
It also facilitates other implementations of different nodes without
touching the core code and remove the need of a header file for each
type of node.
