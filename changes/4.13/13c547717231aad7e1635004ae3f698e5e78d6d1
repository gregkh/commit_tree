qed: Cleaner seperation of LL2 inputs

A LL2 connection [qed_ll2_info] has a sub-structure of type qed_ll2_conn
that contain various inputs for ll2 acquisition, but the connection also
utilizes a couple of other inputs.

Restructure the input structure to include all the inputs and refactor
the code necessary to populate those.
