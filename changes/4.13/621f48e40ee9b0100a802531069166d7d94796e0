arm/arm64: KVM: add guest SEA support

Currently external aborts are unsupported by the guest abort
handling. Add handling for SEAs so that the host kernel reports
SEAs which occur in the guest kernel.

When an SEA occurs in the guest kernel, the guest exits and is
routed to kvm_handle_guest_abort(). Prior to this patch, a print
message of an unsupported FSC would be printed and nothing else
would happen. With this patch, the code gets routed to the APEI
handling of SEAs in the host kernel to report the SEA information.
