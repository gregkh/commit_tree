bnxt_en: Optimize doorbell write operations for newer chips.

Older chips require the doorbells to be written twice, but newer chips
do not.  Add a new common function bnxt_db_write() to write all
doorbells appropriately depending on the chip.  Eliminating the extra
doorbell on newer chips has a significant performance improvement
on pktgen.
