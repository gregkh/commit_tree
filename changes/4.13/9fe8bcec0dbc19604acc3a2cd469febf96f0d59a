net: bridge: Receive notification about successful FDB offload

When a new static FDB is added to the bridge a notification is sent to
the driver for offload. In case of successful offload the driver should
notify the bridge back, which in turn should mark the FDB as offloaded.

Currently, externally learned is equivalent for being offloaded which is
not correct due to the fact that FDBs which are added from user-space are
also marked as externally learned. In order to specify if an FDB was
successfully offloaded a new flag is introduced.
