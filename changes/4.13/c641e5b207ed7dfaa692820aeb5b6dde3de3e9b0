ASoC: fix pcm-creation regression

This reverts commit 99b04f4c4051 ("ASoC: add Component level
pcm_new/pcm_free"), which started calling the pcm_new callback for every
component in a *card* when creating a new pcm, something which does not
seem to make any sense.

This specifically led to memory leaks in systems with more than one
platform component and where DMA memory is allocated in the
platform-driver callback. For example, when both mcasp devices are being
used on an am335x board, DMA memory would be allocated twice for every
DAI link during probe.

When CONFIG_SND_VERBOSE_PROCFS was set this fortunately also led to
warnings such as:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 565 at ../fs/proc/generic.c:346 proc_register+0x110/0x154
proc_dir_entry 'sub0/prealloc' already registered

Since there seems to be no users of the new component callbacks, and the
current implementation introduced a regression, let's revert the
offending commit for now.
