net/cxgb4: Use new PCI_DEV_FLAGS_NO_RELAXED_ORDERING flag

cxgb4 Ethernet driver now queries PCIe configuration space to determine
if it can send TLPs to it with the Relaxed Ordering Attribute set.

Remove the enable_pcie_relaxed_ordering() to avoid enable PCIe Capability
Device Control[Relaxed Ordering Enable] at probe routine, to make sure
the driver will not send the Relaxed Ordering TLPs to the Root Complex which
could not deal the Relaxed Ordering TLPs.
