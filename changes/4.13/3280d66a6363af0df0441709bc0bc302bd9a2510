blk-mq: Fix queue usage on failed request allocation

blk_mq_get_request() does not release the callers queue usage counter
when allocation fails. The caller still needs to account for its own
queue usage when it is unable to allocate a request.

Fixes: 1ad43c0078b7 ("blk-mq: don't leak preempt counter/q_usage_counter when allocating rq failed")
