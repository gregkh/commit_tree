libnvdimm: clean up command definitions

Remove the command payloads that do not have an associated libnvdimm
ioctl. I.e. remove the payloads that would only ever be carried in the
ND_CMD_CALL envelope. This prevents userspace from growing unnecessary
dependencies on this kernel header when userspace already has everything
it needs to craft and send these commands.
