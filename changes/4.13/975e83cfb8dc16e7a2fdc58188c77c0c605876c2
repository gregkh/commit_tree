PM / Domains: defer dev_pm_domain_set() until genpd->attach_dev succeeds if present

If the genpd->attach_dev or genpd->power_on fails, genpd_dev_pm_attach
may return -EPROBE_DEFER initially. However genpd_alloc_dev_data sets
the PM domain for the device unconditionally.

When subsequent attempts are made to call genpd_dev_pm_attach, it may
return -EEXISTS checking dev->pm_domain without re-attempting to call
attach_dev or power_on.

platform_drv_probe then attempts to call drv->probe as the return value
-EEXIST != -EPROBE_DEFER, which may end up in a situation where the
device is accessed without it's power domain switched on.
