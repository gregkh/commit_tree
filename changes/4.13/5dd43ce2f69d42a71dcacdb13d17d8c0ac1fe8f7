sched/wait: Split out the wait_bit*() APIs from <linux/wait.h> into <linux/wait_bit.h>

The wait_bit*() types and APIs are mixed into wait.h, but they
are a pretty orthogonal extension of wait-queues.

Furthermore, only about 50 kernel files use these APIs, while
over 1000 use the regular wait-queue functionality.

So clean up the main wait.h by moving the wait-bit functionality
out of it, into a separate .h and .c file:

  include/linux/wait_bit.h  for types and APIs
  kernel/sched/wait_bit.c   for the implementation

Update all header dependencies.

This reduces the size of wait.h rather significantly, by about 30%.
