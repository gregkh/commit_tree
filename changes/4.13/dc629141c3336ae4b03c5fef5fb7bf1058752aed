drm: Add const to name field declaration in struct drm_prop_enum_list

There is no reason why the name field should not be const, but
several why it should. The struct should only be used by
drm_property_create_enum() and there the name-field from the struct
is passed to drm_property_add_enum(), which takes a const char * as
a parameter.
