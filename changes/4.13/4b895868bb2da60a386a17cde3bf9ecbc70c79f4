xhci: Fix NULL pointer dereference when cleaning up streams for removed host

This off by one in stream_id indexing caused NULL pointer dereference and
soft lockup on machines with USB attached SCSI devices connected to a
hotpluggable xhci controller.

The code that cleans up pending URBs for dead hosts tried to dereference
a stream ring at the invalid stream_id 0.
ep->stream_info->stream_rings[0] doesn't point to a ring.

Start looping stream_id from 1 like in all the other places in the driver,
and check that the ring exists before trying to kill URBs on it.
