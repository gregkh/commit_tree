drm/i915: Split cursor check_plane into i845 and i9xx variants

The 845/865 and 830/855/9xx+ style cursor don't have that
much in common with each other, so let's just split the
.check_plane() hook into two variants as well.

v2: Keep the common stuff in one place (Chris)
v3: s/DRM_FORMAT_MOD_NONE/DRM_FORMAT_MOD_LINEAR/
