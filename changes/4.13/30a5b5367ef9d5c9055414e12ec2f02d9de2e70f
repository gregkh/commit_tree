percpu: expose statistics about percpu memory via debugfs

There is limited visibility into the use of percpu memory leaving us
unable to reason about correctness of parameters and overall use of
percpu memory. These counters and statistics aim to help understand
basic statistics about percpu memory such as number of allocations over
the lifetime, allocation sizes, and fragmentation.

New Config: PERCPU_STATS
