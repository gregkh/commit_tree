irqchip/gic-v3-its: Don't assume GICv3 hardware supports 16bit INTID

The current ITS driver is assuming every ITS hardware implementation
supports minimum of 16bit INTID. But this is not true, as per GICv3
specification, INTID field is IMPLEMENTATION DEFINED in the range of
14-24 bits. We might see an unpredictable system behavior on systems
where hardware support less than 16bits and software tries to use
64K LPI interrupts.

On Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies QDF2400 platform, boot log shows
confusing information about number of LPI chunks as shown below. The
QDF2400 ITS hardware supports 24bit INTID.

This patch allocates the memory resources for PEND/PROP tables based
on discoverable value which is specified in GITS_TYPER.IDbits. Also
it fixes the log message that reflects the correct number of LPI
chunks were allocated.

ITS@0xff7efe0000: allocated 524288 Devices @3c0400000 (indirect, esz 8, psz 64K, shr 1)
ITS@0xff7efe0000: allocated 8192 Interrupt Collections @3c0130000 (flat, esz 8, psz 64K, shr 1)
ITS@0xff7efe0000: allocated 8192 Virtual CPUs @3c0140000 (flat, esz 8, psz 64K, shr 1)
ITS: Allocated 524032 chunks for LPIs
PCI/MSI: ITS@0xff7efe0000 domain created
Platform MSI: ITS@0xff7efe0000 domain created
