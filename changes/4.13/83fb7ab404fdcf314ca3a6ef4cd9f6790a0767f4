drm/i915/cnl: Add DDI Buffer translation tables for Cannonlake.

These tables are used on voltage wswing sequence initialization
on Cannonlake.

It is a complete new format now in use by the voltage swing team,
not following any other standard in use by any other platform.
Also the registers are different as well. So let's redefine
the translation table for Cannonlake.

The table is huge. So we minimized with the fields that are
different or might be different anytime soon. The common
values will be hardcoded on the voltage swing sequence.

v2: Merge the lower and the upper bits to match the spec table
    and make review easier. This was possible with the good
    idea for Manasi with a better way to handle it on the bit
    macro definition presented on previous patch.
