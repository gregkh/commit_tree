bpf: change x86 JITed program stack layout

in order to JIT programs with different stack sizes we need to
make epilogue and exception path to be stack size independent,
hence move auxiliary stack space from the bottom of the stack
to the top of the stack.
Nice side effect is that JITed function prologue becomes shorter
due to imm8 offset encoding vs imm32.
