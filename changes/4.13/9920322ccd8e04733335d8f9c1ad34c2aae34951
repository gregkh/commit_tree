received by host. Common device configuration parameters are sent
to the device after this. It includes information like device
operating mode (Wi-Fi alone or BT coex), power save related
parameters, GPIO information etc. As device supports BT coex,
this frame is send in COEX queue initially. Based on the operating
mode, CARD READY indication is received from each protocol module
in firmware i.e. WLAN, BT.
