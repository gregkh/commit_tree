staging: speakup: check and convert dev name or ser to dev_t

This patch adds functionality to validate and convert either a device
name or 'ser' memmber of synth into dev_t. Subsequent patch in this set
will call it to convert user-specified device into device number. For
device name, this patch does some basic sanity checks on the string
passed in. It currently supports ttyS*, ttyUSB* and, for selected
synths, lp*.

The patch also introduces a string member variable named 'dev_name' to
struct spk_synth. 'dev_name' represents the device name - ttyUSB0 etc -
which needs conversion to dev_t.
