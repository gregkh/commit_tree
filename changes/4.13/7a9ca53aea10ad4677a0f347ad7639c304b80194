quota: add get_inode_usage callback to transfer multi-inode charges

Ext4 ea_inode feature allows storing xattr values in external inodes to
be able to store values that are bigger than a block in size. Ext4 also
has deduplication support for these type of inodes. With deduplication,
the actual storage waste is eliminated but the users of such inodes are
still charged full quota for the inodes as if there was no sharing
happening in the background.

This design requires ext4 to manually charge the users because the
inodes are shared.

An implication of this is that, if someone calls chown on a file that
has such references we need to transfer the quota for the file and xattr
inodes. Current dquot_transfer() function implicitly transfers one inode
charge. With ea_inode feature, we would like to transfer multiple inode
charges.

Add get_inode_usage callback which can interrogate the total number of
inodes that were charged for a given inode.
