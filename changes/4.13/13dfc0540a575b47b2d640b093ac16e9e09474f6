drm/bridge: Refactor out the panel wrapper from the lvds-encoder bridge.

Many DRM drivers have common code to make a stub connector
implementation that wraps a drm_panel.  By wrapping the panel in a DRM
bridge, all of the connector code (including calls during encoder
enable/disable) goes away.

v2: Fix build with CONFIG_DRM=m, drop "dev" argument that should just
    be the panel's dev, move kerneldoc up a level and document
    _remove().
v3: Fix another breakage with CONFIG_DRM=m, fix breakage with
    CONFIG_OF=n, move protos under CONFIG_DRM_PANEL_BRIDGE, wrap a
    line.
