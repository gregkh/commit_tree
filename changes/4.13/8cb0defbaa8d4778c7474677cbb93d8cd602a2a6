drbd: use bio_clone_fast() instead of bio_clone()

drbd does not modify the bi_io_vec of the cloned bio,
so there is no need to clone that part.  So bio_clone_fast()
is the better choice.
For bio_clone_fast() we need to specify a bio_set.
We could use fs_bio_set, which bio_clone() uses, or
drbd_md_io_bio_set, which drbd uses for metadata, but it is
generally best to avoid sharing bio_sets unless you can
be certain that there are no interdependencies.

So create a new bio_set, drbd_io_bio_set, and use bio_clone_fast().

Also remove a "XXX cannot fail ???" comment because it definitely
cannot fail - bio_clone_fast() doesn't fail if the GFP flags allow for
sleeping.
