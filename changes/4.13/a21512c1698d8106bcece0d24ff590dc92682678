rtc.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- adjust identation of the titles;
- mark a table as such;
- don't capitalize chapter names.
