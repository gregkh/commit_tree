perf/core: Fix time on IOC_ENABLE

Vince reported that when we do IOC_ENABLE/IOC_DISABLE while the task
is SIGSTOP'ed state the timestamps go wobbly.

It turns out we indeed fail to correctly account time while in 'OFF'
state and doing IOC_ENABLE without getting scheduled in exposes the
problem.

Further thinking about this problem, it occurred to me that we can
suffer a similar fate when we migrate an uncore event between CPUs.
The perf_event_install() on the 'new' CPU will do add_event_to_ctx()
which will reset all the time stamp, resulting in a subsequent
update_event_times() to overwrite the total_time_* fields with smaller
values.
