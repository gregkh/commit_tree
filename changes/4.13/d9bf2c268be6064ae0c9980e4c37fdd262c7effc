apparmor: add policy revision file interface

Add a policy revision file to find the current revision of a ns's policy.
There is a revision file per ns, as well as a virtualized global revision
file in the base apparmor fs directory. The global revision file when
opened will provide the revision of the opening task namespace.

The revision file can be waited on via select/poll to detect apparmor
policy changes from the last read revision of the opened file. This
means that the revision file must be read after the select/poll other
wise update data will remain ready for reading.
