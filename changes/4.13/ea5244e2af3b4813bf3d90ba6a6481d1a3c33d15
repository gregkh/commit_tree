serial: 8250: Add flag so drivers can avoid THRE probe

The probing of THRE irq behaviour assumes the other end will be reading
bytes out of the buffer in order to probe the port at driver init. In
some cases the other end cannot be relied upon to read these bytes, so
provide a flag for them to skip this step.

Bit 19 was chosen as the flags are a int and the top bits are taken.
