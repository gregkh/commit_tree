tcp: avoid setting cwnd to invalid ssthresh after cwnd reduction states

If the sender switches the congestion control during ECN-triggered
cwnd-reduction state (CA_CWR), upon exiting recovery cwnd is set to
the ssthresh value calculated by the previous congestion control. If
the previous congestion control is BBR that always keep ssthresh
to TCP_INIFINITE_SSTHRESH, cwnd ends up being infinite. The safe
step is to avoid assigning invalid ssthresh value when recovery ends.
