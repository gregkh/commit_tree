x86/microcode: Look for the initrd at the correct address on 32-bit

Early during boot, the BSP finds the ramdisk's position from boot_params
but by the time the APs get to boot, the BSP has continued in the mean
time and has potentially managed to relocate that ramdisk.

And in that case, the APs need to find the ramdisk at its new position,
in *physical* memory as they're running before paging has been enabled.

Thus, get the updated physical location of the ramdisk which is in the
relocated_ramdisk variable.
