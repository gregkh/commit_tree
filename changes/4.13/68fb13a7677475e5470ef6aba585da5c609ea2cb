i40e: Support firmware CEE DCB UP to TC map re-definition

Changes parsing of FW 4.33 AQ command Get CEE DCBX OPER CFG (0x0A07).
Change is required because FW now creates the oper_prio_tc
nibbles reversed from those in the CEE Priority Group sub-TLV.
This change will only apply to FW 4.33 as future FW versions will use a
different function to parse the CEE data.
