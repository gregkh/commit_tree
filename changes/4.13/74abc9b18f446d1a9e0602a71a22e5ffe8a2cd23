net: ethernet: update drivers to make both SW and HW TX timestamps

Some drivers were calling the skb_tx_timestamp() function only when
a hardware timestamp was not requested. Now that applications can use
the SOF_TIMESTAMPING_OPT_TX_SWHW option to request both software and
hardware timestamps, the drivers need to be modified to unconditionally
call skb_tx_timestamp().
