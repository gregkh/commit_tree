drm/i915/skl+: Watermark calculation cleanup

This patch cleanup/reorganises the watermark calculation functions.
This patch make use of already available macro
"drm_atomic_crtc_state_for_each_plane_state" to walk through
plane_state list instead of calculating plane_state in function itself.

This restructuring will help later patch for new DDB allocation
algorithm to do only algo related changes.

Changes from V1:
 - split the patch in two parts as per Matt's comment
