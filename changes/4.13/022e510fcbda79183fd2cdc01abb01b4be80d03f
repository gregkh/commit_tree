md: remove 'idx' from 'struct resync_pages'

bio_add_page() won't fail for resync bio, and the page index for each
bio is same, so remove it.

More importantly the 'idx' of 'struct resync_pages' is initialized in
mempool allocator function, the current way is wrong since mempool is
only responsible for allocation, we can't use that for initialization.
