tpm: vtpm_proxy: Implement request_locality function.

Implement the request_locality function. To set the locality on the
backend we define vendor-specific TPM 1.2 and TPM 2 ordinals and send
a command to the backend to set the locality for the next commands.

To avoid recursing into requesting the locality, we set the
TPM_TRANSMIT_RAW flag when calling tpm_transmit_cmd. To avoid recursing
into TPM 2 space related commands, we set the space parameter to NULL.
