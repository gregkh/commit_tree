mfd: axp20x-i2c: Document that this must be builtin on x86

On x86 the AXP288 PMIC provides an ACPI OpRegion handler, which must be
available before other drivers using it are loaded, which can only be
ensured if the MFD, OpRegion and i2c-bus drivers are built-in.

Since the AXP20x MFD code is used on non x86 too we cannot simply change
this into a bool, I've tried some Kconfig magic with if x86 but I could
not get this working correctly, so this commit just documents that this
should be built-in on x86, which fixes errors like these during boot:
