net/mlx5: FPGA, Add FW commands for FPGA QPs

The FPGA QP is a high-bandwidth communication channel between the host
CPU and the FPGA device. It allows performing DMA operations between
host memory and the FPGA logic via the ConnectX chip.

Add ConnectX FW commands which create and manipulate FPGA QPs.
