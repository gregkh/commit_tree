drm/i915: Stop sleeping from inside gen6_bsd_submit_request()

submit_request() is called from an atomic context, it's not allowed to
sleep. We have to be careful in our parameters to
intel_uncore_wait_for_register() to limit ourselves to the atomic wait
loop and not incur the wrath of our warnings.
