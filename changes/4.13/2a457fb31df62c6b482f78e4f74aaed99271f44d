efi/capsule-loader: Use page addresses rather than struct page pointers

To give some leeway to code that handles non-standard capsule headers,
let's keep an array of page addresses rather than struct page pointers.

This gives special implementations of efi_capsule_setup_info() the
opportunity to mangle the payload a bit before it is presented to the
firmware, without putting any knowledge of the nature of such quirks
into the generic code.
