udp: keep the sk_receive_queue held when splicing

On packet reception, when we are forced to splice the
sk_receive_queue, we can keep the related lock held, so
that we can avoid re-acquiring it, if fwd memory
scheduling is required.

v1 -> v2:
  the rx_queue_lock_held param in udp_rmem_release() is
  now a bool
