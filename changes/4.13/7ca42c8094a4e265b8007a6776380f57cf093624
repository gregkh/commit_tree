net/mlx5e: Add new profile function update_carrier

Updating the carrier involves specific HW setting, each profile should
use its own function for that.

Both IPoIB and VF representor don't need carrier update function, since
VF representor has only a logical link to VF and IPoIB manages its own
link via ib_core upper layer.
