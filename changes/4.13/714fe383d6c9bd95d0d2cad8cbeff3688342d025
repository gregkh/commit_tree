PCI: Provide Kconfig option for lockless config space accessors

The generic PCI configuration space accessors are globally serialized via
pci_lock. On larger systems this causes massive lock contention when the
configuration space has to be accessed frequently. One such access pattern
is the Intel Uncore performance counter unit.

Provide a kernel config option which can be selected by an architecture
when the low level PCI configuration space accessors in the architecture
use their own serialization or can operate completely lockless.
