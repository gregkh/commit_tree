locking/rtmutex: Remove unnecessary priority adjustment

We don't need to adjust priority before adding a new pi_waiter, the
priority only needs to be updated after pi_waiter change or task
priority change.

Steven Rostedt pointed out:

  "Interesting, I did some git mining and this was added with the original
   entry of the rtmutex.c (23f78d4a03c5). Looking at even that version, I
   don't see the purpose of adjusting the task prio here. It is done
   before anything changes in the task."
