KVM: x86: simplify handling of PKRU

Move it to struct kvm_arch_vcpu, replacing guest_pkru_valid with a
simple comparison against the host value of the register.  The write of
PKRU in addition can be skipped if the guest has not enabled the feature.
Once we do this, we need not test OSPKE in the host anymore, because
guest_CR4.PKE=1 implies host_CR4.PKE=1.

The static PKU test is kept to elide the code on older CPUs.
