libata: Add the AHCI_HFLAG_NO_WRITE_TO_RO flag

While most hardware will simply ignore a write to a read-only register,
some hardware will signal an abort if this occurs.

This commit introduces the flag AHCI_HFLAG_NO_WRITE_TO_RO to prevent the
AHCI library from attempting to write to the HOST_CAP, HOST_CAP2, and
HOST_PORTS_IMPL registers which may be read-only.
