s390: provide default ioremap and iounmap declaration

Move the CONFIG_PCI device so that ioremap and iounmap are always
available. This looks safe as there's nothing PCI specific in the
implementation of these functions.

I have designs to use these functions in scatterlist.c where they'd likely
never be called without CONFIG_PCI set, but this is needed to compile
such changes.
