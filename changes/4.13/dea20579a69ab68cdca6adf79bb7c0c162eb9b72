staging: wlan-ng: prism2mgmt.c: fixed a double endian conversion before calling hfa384x_drvr_setconfig16, also fixes relative sparse warning

staging: wlan-ng: prism2mgmt.c: This patches fixes a double endian conversion.
cpu_to_le16() was called twice first in prism2mgmt_scan and again inside
hfa384x_drvr_setconfig16() for the same variable, hence it was swapped
twice. Incidentally, it also fixed the following sparse warning:

drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2mgmt.c:173:30: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2mgmt.c:173:30:    expected unsigned short [unsigned] [usertype] word
drivers/staging/wlan-ng/prism2mgmt.c:173:30:    got restricted __le16 [usertype] <noident>

Unfortunately, only compile tested.
