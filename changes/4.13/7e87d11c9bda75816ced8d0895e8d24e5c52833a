iio: adc: Add support for TI ADC108S102 and ADC128S102

This is an upstream port of an IIO driver for the TI ADC108S102 and
ADC128S102. The former can be found on the Intel Galileo Gen2 and the
Siemens SIMATIC IOT2000. For those boards, ACPI-based enumeration is
included.

Due to the lack of regulators under ACPI, we hard-code the voltage
provided to the VA pin of the ADC to 5 V, the value used on Galileo and
IOT2000. For DT usage, the regulator "vref-supply" provides this
information. Note that DT usage has not been tested.
