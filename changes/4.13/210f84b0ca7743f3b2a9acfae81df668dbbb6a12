x86: irq: Define a global vector for nested posted interrupts

We are using the same vector for nested/non-nested posted
interrupts delivery, this may cause interrupts latency in
L1 since we can't kick the L2 vcpu out of vmx-nonroot mode.

This patch introduces a new vector which is only for nested
posted interrupts to solve the problems above.
