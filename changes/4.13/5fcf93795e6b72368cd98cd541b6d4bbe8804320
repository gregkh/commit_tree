USB: ene_usb6250: turn off the Removable flag

In the ene_usb6250 sub-driver for usb-storage, the INQUIRY data
returned by the driver indicates that the device has removable media.
While this is technically correct (memory cards can be removed from
the reader), it is not useful because the device automatically
disconnects itself from the USB bus when no media is present.

In addition, the driver does not support the PREVENT-ALLOW MEDIUM
REMOVAL and START STOP UNIT commands, and this can cause
user-interface frameworks to get confused when the user asks for the
card to be removed or ejected.

This patch fixes the problem by changing the INQUIRY data to specify
non-removable media; in practice this value works much better.
