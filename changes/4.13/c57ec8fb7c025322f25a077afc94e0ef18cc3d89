scsi: qedi: Add support for Boot from SAN over iSCSI offload

This patch adds support for Boot from SAN over iSCSI offload. The iSCSI
boot information in the NVRAM is populated under
/sys/firmware/iscsi_bootX/ using qed NVM-image reading API and further
exported to open-iscsi to perform iSCSI login enabling boot over offload
iSCSI interface in a Boot from SAN environment.
