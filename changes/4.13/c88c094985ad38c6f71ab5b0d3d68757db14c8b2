sata: ahci-da850: Fix some error handling paths in 'ahci_da850_probe()'

'rc' is known to be 0 at this point.
If 'platform_get_resource()' or 'devm_ioremap()' fail, return -ENOMEM
instead of 0 which means success.

tj: Changed error code from -ENOMEM to -ENODEV for get_resource
    failure as suggested by Sergei.
