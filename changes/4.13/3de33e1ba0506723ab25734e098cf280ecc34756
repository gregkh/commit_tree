ipv6: accept 64k - 1 packet length in ip6_find_1stfragopt()

A packet length of exactly IPV6_MAXPLEN is allowed, we should
refuse parsing options only if the size is 64KiB or more.

While at it, remove one extra variable and one assignment which
were also introduced by the commit that introduced the size
check. Checking the sum 'offset + len' and only later adding
'len' to 'offset' doesn't provide any advantage over directly
summing to 'offset' and checking it.
