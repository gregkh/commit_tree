amd-xgbe: Add NUMA affinity support for memory allocations

Add support to perform memory allocations on the node of the device. The
original allocation or the ring structure and Tx/Rx queues allocated all
of the memory at once and then carved it up for each channel and queue.
To best ensure that we get as much memory from the NUMA node as we can,
break the channel and ring allocations into individual allocations.
