drm/nouveau/disp/gk104-: Use supplied HDMI InfoFrames

Now that we have the InfoFrame data being provided, for the most
part, program the hardware to use it.

While we're here, and since the functionality will come in handy
for supporting 3D stereoscopy, implement setting the Vendor
("generic"?) InfoFrame.

Also don't enable any InfoFrame that is not provided, and disable
the Vendor InfoFrame when disabling the output.
