xfs: define fatal assert build time tunable

While configurable at runtime, the DEBUG mode assert failure
behavior is usually either desired or not for a particular
situation. For example, developers using kernel modules may prefer
for fatal asserts to remain disabled across module reloads while QE
engineers doing broad regression testing may prefer to have fatal
asserts enabled on boot to facilitate data collection for bug
reports.

To provide a compromise/convenience for developers, create a Kconfig
option that sets the default value of the DEBUG mode 'bug_on_assert'
sysfs tunable. The default behavior remains to trigger kernel BUGs
on assert failures to preserve existing behavior across kernel
configuration updates with DEBUG mode enabled.
