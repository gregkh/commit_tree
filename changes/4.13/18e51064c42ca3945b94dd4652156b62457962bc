drm: Remove drm_device->virtdev

This is a leftover from the drm_bus days, where we've had a
bus-specific device type for every bus type in drm_device. Except for
pci (which we can't remove because dri1 drivers) this is all gone. And
the virt driver also doesn't really need it, dev_to_virtio works
perfectly fine.
