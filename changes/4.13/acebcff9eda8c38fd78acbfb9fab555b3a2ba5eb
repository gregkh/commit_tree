mfd: intel_soc_pmic: Select designware i2c-bus driver

The Crystal Cove PMIC provides an ACPI OPRegion handler, which must be
available before other drivers using it are loaded, which is why
INTEL_SOC_PMIC is a bool.

Just having the driver is not enough, the driver for the i2c-bus must
also be built in, to ensure this, this patch adds a select for it.

This fixes errors like these during boot:

mmc0: SDHCI controller on ACPI [80860F14:00] using ADMA
ACPI Error: No handler for Region [REGS] (ffff93543b0cc3a8) [UserDefinedRegion] (20170119/evregion-166)
ACPI Error: Region UserDefinedRegion (ID=143) has no handler (20170119/exfldio-299)
ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\_SB.PCI0.I2C7.PMI5.GET] (Node ffff93543b0cde10), AE_NOT_EXIST (20170119/psparse-543)
ACPI Error: Method parse/execution failed [\_SB.PCI0.SHC1._PS0] (Node ffff93543b0b5cd0), AE_NOT_EXIST (20170119/psparse-543)
acpi 80860F14:02: Failed to change power state to D0

While at it this patch also changes the human readable name of the Kconfig
option to make clear the INTEL_SOC_PMIC option selects support for the
Intel Crystal Cove PMIC and documents why this is a bool.

[The above patch caused a build error on some archetectures]

From: Arnd Bergmann <arnd@arndb.de>

I ran into a build error on ARM with a platform that has a non-standard
clk implementation:

drivers/clk/clk.o: In function `clk_disable':
clk.c:(.text.clk_disable+0x0): multiple definition of `clk_disable'
arch/arm/mach-omap1/clock.o:clock.c:(.text.clk_disable+0x0): first defined here
drivers/clk/clk.o: In function `clk_enable':
clk.c:(.text.clk_enable+0x0): multiple definition of `clk_enable'
arch/arm/mach-omap1/clock.o:clock.c:(.text.clk_enable+0x0): first defined here

The problem is a device driver that uses 'select COMMON_CLK', which is
generally a bad idea: selecting a subsystem should only be done from
a platform, otherwise we run into circular dependencies. The same driver
also selects 'GPIOLIB' and 'I2C', which has a similar effect.

This turns all three into 'depends on', as it should be.

Finally, we can limit the build to x86, unless we are compile testing.
