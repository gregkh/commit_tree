rbd: use bio_clone_fast() instead of bio_clone()

bio_clone() makes a copy of the bi_io_vec, but rbd never changes that,
so there is no need for a copy.
bio_clone_fast() can be used instead, which avoids making the copy.

This requires that we provide a bio_set.  bio_clone() uses fs_bio_set,
but it isn't, in general, safe to use the same bio_set at different
levels of the stack, as that can lead to deadlocks.  As filesystems
use fs_bio_set, block devices shouldn't.

As rbd never stacks, it is safe to have a single global bio_set for
all rbd devices to use.  So allocate that when the module is
initialised, and use it with bio_clone_fast().
