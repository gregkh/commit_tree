loop: support 4k physical blocksize

When generating bootable VM images certain systems (most notably
s390x) require devices with 4k blocksize. This patch implements
a new flag 'LO_FLAGS_BLOCKSIZE' which will set the physical
blocksize to that of the underlying device, and allow to change
the logical blocksize for up to the physical blocksize.
