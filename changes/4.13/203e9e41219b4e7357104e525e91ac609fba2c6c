kexec: move vmcoreinfo out of the kernel's .bss section

As Eric said,
 "what we need to do is move the variable vmcoreinfo_note out of the
  kernel's .bss section. And modify the code to regenerate and keep this
  information in something like the control page.

  Definitely something like this needs a page all to itself, and ideally
  far away from any other kernel data structures. I clearly was not
  watching closely the data someone decided to keep this silly thing in
  the kernel's .bss section."

This patch allocates extra pages for these vmcoreinfo_XXX variables, one
advantage is that it enhances some safety of vmcoreinfo, because
vmcoreinfo now is kept far away from other kernel data structures.
