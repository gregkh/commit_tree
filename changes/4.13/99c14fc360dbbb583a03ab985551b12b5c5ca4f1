mmc: sdhci-xenon: add set_power callback

Xenon sdh controller requests proper SD bus voltage select
bits programmed even with vmmc power supply. Any reserved
value(100b-000b) programmed in this field will lead to controller
ignore SD bus power bit and keep its value at zero.
Add set_power callback to handle this.
