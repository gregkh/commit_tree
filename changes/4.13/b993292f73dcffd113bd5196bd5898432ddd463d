ARM: dts: qcom-apq8064: Collapse usb support into one node

We currently have three device nodes for the same USB hardware
block, as evident by the reuse of the same reg address multiple
times. Now that the chipidea driver fully supports OTG with the
MSM wrapper we can collapse the three nodes into one USB device
node, reflecting the true nature of the hardware.

Since we're here, we also mark the irq trigger flags correctly,
as IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH instead of IRQ_TYPE_NONE.
