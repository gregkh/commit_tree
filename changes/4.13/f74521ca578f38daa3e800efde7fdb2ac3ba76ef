regulator: max8997/8966: fix charger cv voltage set bug

When min charger-CV is <= 4.0V and max charger-CV is >= 4.0V,
we can use 4.00V as CV (register value = 0x1).`

The original code had a typo that wrote ">=" (max_uV >= 4000000),
which should've been "<", which is not necessary anyway
as mentioned by Dan Carpenter.
