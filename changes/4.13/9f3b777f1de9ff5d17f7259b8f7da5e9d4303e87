ASoC: codecs: msm8916: fix invalid cast to bool type

A function snd_soc_update_bits() is an application of
regmap_update_bits_base(). This function takes some arguments for bitmask
and new value, thus the arguments should be a type which has width.
However bool is used to variable for the argument. This brings truncation
and results in invalid operation.

This commit fixes this bug by using unsigned int type, instead of bool.
