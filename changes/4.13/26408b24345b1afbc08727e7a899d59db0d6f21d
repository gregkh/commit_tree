ACPI / power: constify attribute_group structures

attribute_groups are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with attribute_groups provided by <linux/sysfs.h> work with const
attribute_group. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   4622	    304	      8	   4934	   1346	drivers/acpi/power.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   4846	     80	      8	   4934	   1346	drivers/acpi/power.o
