brcmfmac: fix memleak due to calling brcmf_sdiod_sgtable_alloc() twice

Due to a bugfix in wireless tree and the commit mentioned below a merge
was needed which went haywire. So the submitted change resulted in the
function brcmf_sdiod_sgtable_alloc() being called twice during the probe
thus leaking the memory of the first call.
