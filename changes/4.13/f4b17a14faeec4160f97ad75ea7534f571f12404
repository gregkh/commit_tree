i2c: core: Make comment about I2C table requirement to reflect the code

I2C drivers were required to have an I2C device ID table even if were for
devices that would only be registered using a specific firmware interface
(e.g: OF or ACPI).

But commit da10c06a044b ("i2c: Make I2C ID tables non-mandatory for DT'ed
devices") changed the I2C core to relax the requirement and allow drivers
to avoid defining this table.

Unfortunately it only took into account drivers for OF-only devices and
forgot about ACPI-only ones, and this was fixed by commit c64ffff7a9d1
("i2c: core: Allow empty id_table in ACPI case as well").

But the latter didn't update the original comment, so it doesn't reflect
what the code does now.
