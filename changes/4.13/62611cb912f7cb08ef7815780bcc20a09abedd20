intel_pstate: delete scheduler hook in HWP mode

The cpufreq/scaling_cur_freq sysfs attribute is now provided by
shared x86 cpufreq code on modern x86 systems, including
all systems supported by the intel_pstate driver.

In HWP mode, maintaining that value was the sole purpose of
the scheduler hook, intel_pstate_update_util_hwp(),
so it can now be removed.
