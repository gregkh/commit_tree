sched/wait: Standardize internal naming of wait-queue heads

The wait-queue head parameters and variables are named in a
couple of ways, we have the following variants currently:

	wait_queue_head_t *q
	wait_queue_head_t *wq
	wait_queue_head_t *head

In particular the 'wq' naming is ambiguous in the sense whether it's
a wait-queue head or entry name - as entries were often named 'wait'.

( Not to mention the confusion of any readers coming over from
  workqueue-land. )

Standardize all this around a single, unambiguous parameter and
variable name:

	struct wait_queue_head *wq_head

which is easy to grep for and also rhymes nicely with the wait-queue
entry naming:

	struct wait_queue_entry *wq_entry

Also rename:

	struct __wait_queue_head => struct wait_queue_head

... and use this struct type to migrate from typedefs usage to 'struct'
usage, which is more in line with existing kernel practices.

Don't touch any external users and preserve the main wait_queue_head_t
typedef.
