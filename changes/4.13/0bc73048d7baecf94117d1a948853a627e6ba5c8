x86/platform/intel-mid: Fix a format string overflow warning

We have space for exactly three characters for the index in "max7315_%d_base",
but as GCC points out having more would cause an string overflow:

  arch/x86/platform/intel-mid/device_libs/platform_max7315.c: In function 'max7315_platform_data':
  arch/x86/platform/intel-mid/device_libs/platform_max7315.c:41:26: error: '%d' directive writing between 1 and 11 bytes into a region of size 9 [-Werror=format-overflow=]
     sprintf(base_pin_name, "max7315_%d_base", nr);
                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  arch/x86/platform/intel-mid/device_libs/platform_max7315.c:41:26: note: directive argument in the range [-2147483647, 2147483647]
  arch/x86/platform/intel-mid/device_libs/platform_max7315.c:41:3: note: 'sprintf' output between 15 and 25 bytes into a destination of size 17
     sprintf(base_pin_name, "max7315_%d_base", nr);

This makes it use an snprintf() to truncate the string if that happened
rather than overflowing the stack. In practice, this is safe, because
there won't be a large number of max7315 devices in the systems, and
both the format and the length are defined by the firmware interface.
