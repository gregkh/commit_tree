ubifs: Don't leak kernel memory to the MTD

When UBIFS prepares data structures which will be written to the MTD it
ensues that their lengths are multiple of 8. Since it uses kmalloc() the
padded bytes are left uninitialized and we leak a few bytes of kernel
memory to the MTD.
To make sure that all bytes are initialized, let's switch to kzalloc().
Kzalloc() is fine in this case because the buffers are not huge and in
the IO path the performance bottleneck is anyway the MTD.
