net/mlx5: IPSec, fix 64-bit division correctly

The new IPSec offload code introduced a build error:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlx5/core/en_accel/ipsec_rxtx.o: In function `mlx5e_ipsec_build_inverse_table':
ipsec_rxtx.c:(.text+0x556): undefined reference

Another patch was added on top to fix the build error, but
that introduced a new bug, as we now use the remainder of
the division rather than the result.

This makes it use the correct helper function instead.

Fixes: 5dfd87b67cd9 ("net/mlx5: IPSec, Fix 64-bit division on 32-bit builds")
Fixes: 2ac9cfe78223 ("net/mlx5e: IPSec, Add Innova IPSec offload TX data path")
