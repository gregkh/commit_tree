platform/x86: wmi-bmof: New driver to expose embedded Binary WMI MOF metadata

Many laptops (and maybe servers?) have embedded WMI Binary MOF metadata.
We do not yet have open-source tools for processing the data, although
one is in the works thanks to Pali:

	https://github.com/pali/bmfdec

There is currently no interface to get the data in the first place. By
exposing it, we facilitate the development of new tools.

This is based on the original work of Andy Lutomirski <luto@kernel.org>,
but contains several modifications in response to various reviews.
