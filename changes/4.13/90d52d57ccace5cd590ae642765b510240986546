PCI: qcom: Add support for IPQ4019 PCIe controller

Add support for the IPQ4019 PCIe controller.  IPQ4019 supports Gen 1/2, one
lane, one PCIe root complex with support for MSI and legacy interrupts, and
it conforms to PCI Express Base 2.1 specification.

The core init is the same as for the MSM8996, however the clocks and reset
lines differ.
