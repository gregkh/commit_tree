ALSA: usb-audio: Add mute TLV for playback volumes on C-Media devices

C-Media devices (at least some models) mute the playback stream when
volumes are set to the minimum value.  But this isn't informed via TLV
and the user-space, typically PulseAudio, gets confused as if it's
still played in a low volume.

This patch adds the new flag, min_mute, to struct usb_mixer_elem_info
for indicating that the mixer element is with the minimum-mute volume.
This flag is set for known C-Media devices in
snd_usb_mixer_fu_apply_quirk() in turn.
