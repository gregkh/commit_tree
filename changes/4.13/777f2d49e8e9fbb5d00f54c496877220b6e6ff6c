mtd: nand: denali: enable bad block table scan

Now this driver is ready to remove NAND_SKIP_BBTSCAN.

The BBT descriptors in denali.c are equivalent to the ones in
nand_bbt.c.  There is no need to duplicate the equivalent structures.
The with-oob decriptors do not work for this driver anyway.

The bbt_pattern (offs = 8) and the version (veroffs = 12) area
overlaps the ECC area.  Set NAND_BBT_NO_OOB flag to use the no_oob
variant of the BBT descriptors.
