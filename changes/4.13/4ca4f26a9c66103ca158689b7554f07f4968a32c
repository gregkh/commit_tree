arm,arm64,drivers: add a prefix to drivers arch_topology interfaces

Now that some functions that deal with arch topology information live
under drivers, there is a clash of naming that might create confusion.

Tidy things up by creating a topology namespace for interfaces used by
arch code; achieve this by prepending a 'topology_' prefix to driver
interfaces.
