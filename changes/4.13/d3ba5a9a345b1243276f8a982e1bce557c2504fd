posix-timers: Make posix_clocks immutable

There are no more modular users providing a posix clock. The register
function is now pointless so the posix clock array can be initialized
statically at compile time and the array including the various k_clock
structs can be marked 'const'.

Inspired by changes in the Grsecurity patch set, but done proper.

[ tglx: Massaged changelog and fixed the POSIX_TIMER=n case ]
