nanosleep: Use get_timespec64() and put_timespec64()

Usage of these apis and their compat versions makes
the syscalls: clock_nanosleep and nanosleep and
their compat implementations simpler.

This is a preparatory patch to isolate data conversions to
struct timespec64 at userspace boundaries. This helps contain
the changes needed to transition to new y2038 safe types.
