hw_random: timeriomem_rng: Allow setting RNG quality from platform data

When a hw_random device's quality is non-zero, it will automatically be
used to fill the kernel's entropy pool.  Since timeriomem_rng is used by
many different devices, the quality needs to be provided by platform
data or device tree.
