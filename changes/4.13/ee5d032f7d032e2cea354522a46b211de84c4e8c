xdp: add HW offload mode flag for installing programs

Add an installation-time flag for requesting that the program
be installed only if it can be offloaded to HW.

Internally new command for ndo_xdp is added, this way we avoid
putting checks into drivers since they all return -EINVAL on
an unknown command.
