svcrdma: Improve Reply chunk sanity checking

Identify malformed transport headers and unsupported chunk
combinations as early as possible.

- Ensure that segment lengths are not crazy.

- Ensure that the Reply chunk's segment count is not crazy.

With a 1KB inline threshold, the largest number of Write segments
that can be conveyed is about 60 (for a RDMA_NOMSG Reply message).
