ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add enum control for mic selection

User may prefer to select data from particular mics. A mic-select module
in DSP allows this selection.

Create possible enum controls to allow user to select a combination of
mics to capture data from. Based on the user selection, parameters are
generated and passed to mic-select module during init.
