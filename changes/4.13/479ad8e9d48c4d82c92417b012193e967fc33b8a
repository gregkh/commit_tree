scsi: cxlflash: Remove zeroing of private command data

The SCSI core now zeroes the per-command private data area prior to
calling into the LLD. Replace the clearing operation that takes place
when the private command data reference is obtained with a routine that
performs common initializations. The zeroing that takes place in the
device reset path remains intact as the private command data associated
with the specified SCSI command is not guaranteed to be cleared.
