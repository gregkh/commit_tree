nfp: version independent support for chained RSS metadata

ABI version 4 introduced metadata chaining. Using the ABI version to signal
metadata chaining precludes firmware that advertises new capabilities which
rely on prepended metadata from working on older kernels.

Capability bits are thus better suited to signalling the chained metadata
format. A new version of the RSS capability is introduced to distinguish
between the differing metadata formats for ABI versions other than 4.
