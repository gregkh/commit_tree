bpf: fix return in load_bpf_file

The function load_bpf_file ignores the return value of
load_and_attach(), so even if load_and_attach() returns an error,
load_bpf_file() will return 0.

Now, load_bpf_file() can call load_and_attach() multiple times and some
can succeed and some could fail. I think the correct behavor is to
return error on the first failed load_and_attach().
