s390/mm: use correct address space when enabling DAT

Right now the kernel uses the primary address space until finally the
switch to the correct home address space will be done when the idle
PSW will be loaded within psw_idle().

Correct this and simply use the home address space when DAT is enabled
for the first time.

This doesn't really fix a bug, but fixes odd behavior.
