igmp: Fix regression caused by igmp sysctl namespace code.

Commit dcd87999d415 ("igmp: net: Move igmp namespace init to correct file")
moved the igmp sysctls initialization from tcp_sk_init to igmp_net_init. This
function is only called as part of per-namespace initialization, only if
CONFIG_IP_MULTICAST is defined, otherwise igmp_mc_init() call in ip_init is
compiled out, casuing the igmp pernet ops to not be registerd and those sysctl
being left initialized with 0. However, there are certain functions, such as
ip_mc_join_group which are always compiled and make use of some of those
sysctls. Let's do a partial revert of the aforementioned commit and move the
sysctl initialization into inet_init_net, that way they will always have
sane values.
