Revert "blk-mq: don't use sync workqueue flushing from drivers"

This patch reverts commit 2719aa217e0d02(blk-mq: don't use
sync workqueue flushing from drivers) because only
blk_mq_quiesce_queue() need the sync flush, and now
we don't need to stop queue any more, so revert it.

Also changes to cancel_delayed_work() in blk_mq_stop_hw_queue().
