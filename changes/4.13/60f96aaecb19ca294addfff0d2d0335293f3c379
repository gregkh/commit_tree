ALSA: pcm: localize snd_pcm_hw_params_choose()

As of v4.12, snd_pcm_hw_params_choose() is just called in a process
context of ioctl(2) with SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_HW_PARAMS. The function locates
in a different file, which has no tracepoints.

This commit moves the function to a file with the tracepoints for later
commit.
