PCI: dwc: dra7xx: Use RW1C for IRQSTATUS_MSI and IRQSTATUS_MAIN

Previously, we tried to clear interrupt requests by clearing bits in the
PCIECTRL_DRA7XX_CONF_IRQSTATUS_MSI and PCIECTRL_DRA7XX_CONF_IRQSTATUS_MAIN
registers.  But per the TRM, these fields are RW1C, so we must *set* bits
to clear the interrupt bits.
