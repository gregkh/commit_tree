dmaengine: rcar-dmac: implement device_synchronize()

Implement the device_synchronize() callback which wait until a dma
channel is stopped to provide a synchronization point.

This protects the driver from multiple race conditions when terminating
and freeing resources. E.g. the completion callback still running after
device_terminate_all() has completed.
