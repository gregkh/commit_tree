ntb.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx.

This file is using some other markup notation (likely, markdown).
Convert it to the adopted standard:

  - Adjust the header level markup;
  - Adjust identation for debugfs files and module parameters.
