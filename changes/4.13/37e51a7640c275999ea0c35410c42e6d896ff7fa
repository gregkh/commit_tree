mm: clean up error handling in write_one_page

Don't try to check PageError since that's potentially racy and not
necessarily going to be set after writepage errors out.

Instead, check the mapping for an error after writepage returns. That
should also help us detect errors that occurred if the VM tried to
clean the page earlier due to memory pressure.
