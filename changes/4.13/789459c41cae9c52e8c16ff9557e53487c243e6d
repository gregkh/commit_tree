ARM: dts: imx6-sabrelite: add OV5642 and OV5640 camera sensors

Adds the OV5642 parallel-bus sensor, and the OV5640 MIPI CSI-2 sensor.
Both hang off the same i2c2 bus, so they require different (and non-
default) i2c slave addresses.

The OV5642 connects to the parallel-bus mux input port on ipu1_csi0_mux.

The OV5640 connects to the input port on the MIPI CSI-2 receiver on
mipi_csi.

The OV5642 node is disabled temporarily while the subdev driver is
cleaned up and submitted later.
