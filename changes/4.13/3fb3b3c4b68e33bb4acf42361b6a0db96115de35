memory: atmel-ebi: Fix smc cycle xlate converter

The converter function for translating ns timings in register values was
initialized with a wrong function pointer. This resulted in wrong
register values also for the setup and pulse registers when configuring
the EBI interface trough dts.

Includes a small fix in a comment of the smc driver, which was probably
just a copy'n'paste mistake.
