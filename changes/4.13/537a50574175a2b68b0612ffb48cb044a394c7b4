net/mlx5: FPGA, Add high-speed connection routines

An FPGA high-speed connection has two endpoints, an FPGA QP and a
ConnectX QP.
Add library routines to create and connect the endpoints of an
FPGA high-speed connection.

These routines allow creating and interacting with both types of
connections: Shell and Sandbox Unit (SBU).

Shell connection provides an interface to the FPGA's address space,
which includes the configuration space and the DDR.
Use of the shell connection will be introduced in a later patchset.

SBU connection provides a command and/or data interface to the
application-specific logic within the FPGA.
Use of the SBU connection will be introduced in a later patch in
this patchset.

Some struct definitions are added to a new header file sdk.h, which
will be extended in later patches in the patchset.
This header file will contain the in-kernel FPGA client driver API.
