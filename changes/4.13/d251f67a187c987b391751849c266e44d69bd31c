arm64: Add a facility to turn an ESR syndrome into a sysreg encoding

It is often useful to compare an ESR syndrome reporting the trapping
of a system register with a value matching that system register.

Since encoding both the sysreg and the ESR version seem to be a bit
overkill, let's add a set of macros that convert an ESR value into
the corresponding sysreg encoding.

We handle both AArch32 and AArch64, taking advantage of identical
encodings between system registers and CP15 accessors.
