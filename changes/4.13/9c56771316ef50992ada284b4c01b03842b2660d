test_kmod: fix the lock in register_test_dev_kmod()

We accidentally just drop the lock twice instead of taking it and then
releasing it.  This isn't a big issue unless you are adding more than
one device to test on, and the kmod.sh doesn't do that yet, however this
obviously is the correct thing to do.
