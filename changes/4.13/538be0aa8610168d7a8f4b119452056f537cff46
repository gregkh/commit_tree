HID: intel_ish-hid: clarify locking in client code

I was trying to understand this code while working on a warning
fix and the locking made no sense: spin_lock_irqsave() is pointless
when run inside of an interrupt handler or nested inside of another
spin_lock_irq() or spin_lock_irqsave().

Here it turned out that the comment above the function is wrong,
as both recv_ishtp_cl_msg_dma() and recv_ishtp_cl_msg() can in fact
be called from a work queue rather than an ISR, so we do have to
use the irqsave() version once.

This fixes the comments accordingly, removes the misleading 'dev_flags'
variable and modifies the inner spinlock to not use 'irqsave'.

No functional change is intended, this is just for readability and
it slightly simplifies the object code.
