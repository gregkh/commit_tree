MIPS: cmpxchg: Drop __xchg_u{32,64} functions

The __xchg_u32() & __xchg_u64() functions now add very little value.
This patch therefore removes them, by:

  - Moving memory barriers out of them & into xchg(), which also removes
    the duplication & readies us to support xchg_relaxed() if we wish to.

  - Calling __xchg_asm() directly from __xchg().

  - Performing the check for CONFIG_64BIT being enabled in the size=8
    case of __xchg().
