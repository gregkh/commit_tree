ARM: dts: dra7x-evm: Enable dual-role mode for USB1

USB1 port is micro-AB type and can function as peripheral
as well as host. Enable dual-role mode for USB1.

We don't want to use the OTG controller block on this
platform as it limits host mode to high-speed. Instead
we rely on extcon framework to give us ID events for
dual-role mode detection.
