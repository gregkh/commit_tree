power: supply: sbs-battery: Prevent CAPACITY_MODE races

A subset of smart battery commands return charge or energy depending on
the CAPACITY_MODE bit setting of BatteryMode(). In order to
unambiguously read a charge or energy value, it is necessary to ensure
that CAPACITY_MODE is set as desired, and not changed for the duration
of the attribute read.
