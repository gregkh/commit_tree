rtnl: Add support for netdev event to link messages

When netdev events happen, a rtnetlink_event() handler will send
messages for every event in it's white list.  These messages contain
current information about a particular device, but they do not include
the iformation about which event just happened.  So, it is impossible
to tell what just happend for these events.

This patch adds a new extension to RTM_NEWLINK message called IFLA_EVENT
that would have an encoding of event that triggered this
message.  This would allow the the message consumer to easily determine
if it needs to perform certain actions.
