iio: adc: Fix integration time/averaging for INA219/220

INA226/230/231 has integration times per voltage channel and common
averaging setting for both channels, while the INA219/220 only has a
combined integration time/averaging setting per channel.
Only expose the averaging attribute for the INA226, and expose the correct
integration times for the INA219.
