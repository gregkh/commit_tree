nvmet: implement namespace identify descriptor list

A NVMe Identify NS command with a CNS value of '3' is expecting a list
of Namespace Identification Descriptor structures to be returned to
the host for the namespace requested in the namespace identify
command.

This Namespace Identification Descriptor structure consists of the
type of the namespace identifier, the length of the identifier and the
actual identifier.

Valid types are NGUID and UUID which we have saved in our nvme_ns
structure if they have been configured via configfs. If no value has
been assigened to one of these we return an "invalid opcode" back to
the host to maintain backward compatibiliy with older implementations
without Namespace Identify Descriptor list support.

Also as the Namespace Identify Descriptor list is the only mandatory
feature change between 1.2.1 and 1.3 we can bump the advertised
version as well.
