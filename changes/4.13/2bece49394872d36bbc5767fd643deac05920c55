ACPI: SPCR: Use access width to determine mmio usage

The current SPCR code does not check the access width of the MMIO, and
uses a default of 8bit register accesses.  This prevents devices that
only do 16 or 32bit register accesses from working.  By simply checking
this field and setting the MMIO string appropriately, this issue can be
corrected.  To prevent any legacy issues, the code will default to 8bit
accesses if the value is anything but 16 or 32.
