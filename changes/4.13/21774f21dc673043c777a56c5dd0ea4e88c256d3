drm/hdlcd|mali: Drop drm_vblank_cleanup

IRQs are properly shut down, so it almost works as race-free shutdown.
Except the irq is stopped after the vblank stuff, so boom anyway.
Proper way would be to call drm_atomic_helper_shutdown before any of
the kms things gets stopped. So no harm in removing the
drm_vblank_cleanup here really.

Same story for both hdlcd and mali.

v2: Move misplaced malidp hunk to this patch (Liviu).
