bpf: Fix test_bpf_obj_id() when the bpf_jit_enable sysctl is diabled

test_bpf_obj_id() should not expect a non zero jited_prog_len
to be returned by bpf_obj_get_info_by_fd() when
net.core.bpf_jit_enable is 0.

The patch checks for net.core.bpf_jit_enable and
has different expectation on jited_prog_len.

This patch also removes the pwd.h header which I forgot
to remove after making changes.
