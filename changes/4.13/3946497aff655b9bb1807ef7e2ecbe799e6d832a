qed: Pass vf_params when creating a queue-cid

We're going to need additional information for queue-cids
that a PF creates for its VFs, so start by refactoring existing
logic used for initializing said struct into receiving a structure
encapsulating the VF-specific information that needs to be provided.

This also introduces QED_QUEUE_CID_SELF - each queue-cid would hold
an indication to whether it belongs to the hw-function holding it
[whether that's a PF or a VF], or else what's the VF id it belongs
to.
