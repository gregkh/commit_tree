powerpc/powernv/pci: Add helper to check if a PE has a single vendor

Add a helper that determines if all the devices contained in a given PE
are all from the same vendor or not.  This can be useful in determining
if it's okay to make PE-wide changes that may be suitable for some
devices but not for others.

This is used later in the series.
