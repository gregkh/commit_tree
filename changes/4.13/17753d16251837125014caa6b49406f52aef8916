mmc: sdhci-acpi: Workaround conflict with PCI wifi on GPD Win handheld

GPDwin uses PCI wifi which conflicts with SDIO's use of
acpi_device_fix_up_power() on child device nodes. Specifically
acpi_device_fix_up_power() causes the wifi module to get turned off.
Identifying GPDwin is problematic, but since SDIO is only used for wifi,
the presence of the PCI wifi card in the expected slot with an ACPI
companion node, is used to indicate that acpi_device_fix_up_power() should
be avoided.
