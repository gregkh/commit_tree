PCI/PM: Avoid using device_may_wakeup() for runtime PM

pci_target_state() calls device_may_wakeup() which checks whether or not
the device may wake up the system from sleep states, but pci_target_state()
is used for runtime PM too.

Since runtime PM is expected to always enable remote wakeup if possible,
modify pci_target_state() to take additional argument indicating whether or
not it should look for a state from which the device can signal wakeup and
pass either the return value of device_can_wakeup(), or "false" (if the
device itself is not wakeup-capable) to it from the code related to runtime
PM.

While at it, fix the comment in pci_dev_run_wake() which is not about sleep
states.
