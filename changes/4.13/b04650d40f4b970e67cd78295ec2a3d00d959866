arm64: dts: r8a7796: salvator-x: Set drive-strength for ravb pins

The EthernetAVB should not depend on the bootloader to setup correct
drive-strength values.  Values for drive-strength where found by
examining the registers after the bootloader has configured the
registers and successfully used the EthernetAVB.

Based on commit 7d73a4da2681dc5d ("arm64: dts: r8a7795: salvator-x: Set
drive-strength for ravb pins").
