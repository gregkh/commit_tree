s390: reduce ELF_ET_DYN_BASE

Now that explicitly executed loaders are loaded in the mmap region, we
have more freedom to decide where we position PIE binaries in the
address space to avoid possible collisions with mmap or stack regions.

For 64-bit, align to 4GB to allow runtimes to use the entire 32-bit
address space for 32-bit pointers.  On 32-bit use 4MB, which is the
traditional x86 minimum load location, likely to avoid historically
requiring a 4MB page table entry when only a portion of the first 4MB
would be used (since the NULL address is avoided).  For s390 the
position could be 0x10000, but that is needlessly close to the NULL
address.
