arm64: fix endianness annotation in get_kaslr_seed()

In the flattened device tree format, all integer properties are
in big-endian order.
Here the property "kaslr-seed" is read from the fdt and then
correctly converted to native order (via fdt64_to_cpu()) but the
pointer used for this is not annotated as being for big-endian.

Fix this by declaring the pointer as fdt64_t instead of u64
(fdt64_t being itself typedefed to __be64).
