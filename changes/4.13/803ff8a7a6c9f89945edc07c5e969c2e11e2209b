x86/hpet: Do not use smp_processor_id() in preemptible code

When hpet=force is supplied on the kernel command line and the HPET
supports the Legacy Replacement Interrupt Route option (HPET_ID_LEGSUP),
the legacy interrupts init code uses the boot CPU's mask initially by
calling smp_processor_id() assuming that it is running on the BSP.

It does run on the BSP but the code region is preemptible and the
preemption check fires.

Simply use the BSP's id directly to avoid the warning.
