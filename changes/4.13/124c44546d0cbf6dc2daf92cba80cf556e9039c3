dm flakey: add support for zoned block devices

With the development of file system support for zoned block devices
(e.g. f2fs), having dm-flakey support these devices is interesting
to improve testing.

Add host-aware and host-managed zoned block devices support to in
dm-flakey.  The target type feature is set to DM_TARGET_ZONED_HM to
indicate support for host-managed models.  Also add hooks for remapping
of REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET and REQ_OP_ZONE_REPORT bios.  Additionally, in the
bio completion path, (backward) remapping of a zone report reply is
added.
