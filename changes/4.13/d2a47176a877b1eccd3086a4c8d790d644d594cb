mmc: core: Remove MMC_CAP2_HC_ERASE_SZ

The MMC_CAP2_HC_ERASE_SZ is used only by a few mmc host drivers. Its intent
is to enable eMMC's high-capacity erase size, as to improve the behaviour
of the erase operations.

We should strive to avoid software configuration options that aren't
necessary, but instead deploy common behaviours. For these reasons, let's
remove the capability bit for MMC_CAP2_HC_ERASE_SZ and make it the default
behaviour.

Note that this change doesn't affect eMMCs supporting trim/discard, because
these commands operates on sectors and takes precedence over erase
commands.
