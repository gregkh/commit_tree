arm64: traps: disable irq in die()

In current die(), the irq is disabled for __die() handle, not
including the possible panic() handling. Since the log in __die()
can take several hundreds ms, new irq might come and interrupt
current die().

If the process calling die() holds some critical resource, and some
other process scheduled later also needs it, then it would deadlock.
The first panic will not be executed.

So here disable irq for the whole flow of die().
