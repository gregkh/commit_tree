[media] lirc_dev: merge lirc_register_driver() and lirc_allocate_driver()

Merging the two means that lirc_allocate_buffer() is called before
device_add() and cdev_add() which makes more sense. This also
simplifies the locking slightly because lirc_allocate_buffer() will
always be called with lirc_dev_lock held.
