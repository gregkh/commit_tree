ACPICA: Events: Add runtime stub support for event APIs

ACPICA commit 99bc3beca92c6574ea1d69de42e54f872e6373ce

It is reported that on Linux, RTC driver complains wrong errors on
hardware reduced platform:
  [    4.085420] ACPI Warning: Could not enable fixed event - real_time_clock (4) (20160422/evxface-654)

This patch fixes this by correctly adding runtime reduced hardware check.
Reported by Chandan Tagore, fixed by Lv Zheng.
