ARM: OMAP2+: Remove unused legacy code for device init

We are now booting all mach-omap2 in device tree only mode.
Any code that is only called in legacy boot mode where
of_have_populated_dt() is not set is safe to remove now.

Note that omap_init_sti() won't do anything so we can
remove omap2_init_devices() as pointed out by Sebastian
Reichel <sebastian.reichel@collabora.co.uk>.
