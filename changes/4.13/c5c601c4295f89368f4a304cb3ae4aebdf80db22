irqdomain: Allow ACPI device nodes to be used as irqdomain identifiers

A number of irqchip implementations are (ab)using the irqdomain allocator
by passing a fwnode that is neither a FWNODE_OF or a FWNODE_IRQCHIP.

This is pretty bad, but it also feels pretty crap to force these drivers to
allocate their own irqchip_fwid when they already have a proper fwnode.

Instead, let's teach the irqdomain allocator about ACPI device nodes, and
add some lovely name generation code... Tested on an arm64 D05 system.
