scsi: hisi_sas: optimise the usage of hisi_hba.lock

Currently hisi_hba.lock is locked to deliver and receive a command
to/from any hw queue. This causes much contention at high data-rates.

To boost performance, lock on a per queue basis for sending and
receiving commands to/from hw.

Certain critical regions still need to be locked in the delivery and
completion stages with hisi_hba.lock.

New element hisi_sas_device.dq is added to store the delivery queue for
a device, so it does not need to be needlessly re-calculated for every
task.
