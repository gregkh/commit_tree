cciss: initialize struct scsi_req

The changes in "block: Make most scsi_req_init() calls implicit" mean
that every driver that supports the generic scsi ioctls needs to
call scsi_req_init on newly allocated requests, but that commit didn't
add the call to the cc—ñss driver.  Fix that to avoid crashes when
udev issues SG_IO commands.
