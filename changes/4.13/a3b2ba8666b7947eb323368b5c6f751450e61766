rtlwifi: btcoex: 21a 2ant: refine bt info notify to have more profilings

We add some profiling combinations when the bt notifies the coex
mechanism to detect more situations and adjust the coex to fit to it.

Also monitor if the wifi is under 5G mode, if so, the signals do net
intefere each other, bt can just ignore it
