drm/vc4: Fix VBLANK handling in crtc->enable() path

When we are enabling a CRTC, drm_crtc_vblank_get() is called before
drm_crtc_vblank_on(), which is not supposed to happen (hence the
WARN_ON() in the code). To solve the problem, we delay the 'update
display list' operation after the CRTC is actually enabled.
