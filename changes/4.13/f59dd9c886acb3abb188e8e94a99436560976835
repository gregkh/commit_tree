time: add get_timespec64 and put_timespec64

Add helper functions to convert between struct timespec64 and
struct timespec at userspace boundaries.

This is a preparatory patch to use timespec64 as the basic type
internally in the kernel as timespec is not y2038 safe on 32 bit systems.
The patch helps the cause by containing all data conversions at the
userspace boundaries within these functions.
