cpuidle: menu: allow state 0 to be disabled

The menu driver does not allow state0 to be disabled completely.
If it is disabled but other enabled states don't meet latency
requirements, it is still used.

Fix this by starting with the first enabled idle state. Fall back
to state 0 if no idle states are enabled (arguably this should be
-EINVAL if it is attempted, but this is the minimal fix).
