IB/ipoib: Fix race between light events and interface restart

A potential race between light_event and interface restart
may attach multicast group to an already attached QP.

Scenario:
light_event flow goes through ipoib_mcast_dev_flush function,
if a context switch occurs before calling ipoib_mcast_remove_list,
then we may face a situation where the broadcast of the priv is null
and the corresponding QP is not detached yet.
If an "interface restart" runs during the previous context switch,
the following scenario occurs:
When the device goes up, ipoib_ib_dev_up function will be called,
it will send a new registration request to the broadcast group and then
attach the group to the QP that was not detached before.
