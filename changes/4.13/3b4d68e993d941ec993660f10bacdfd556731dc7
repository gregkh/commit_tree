drm/amdgpu:use FRAME_CNTL for new GFX ucode (v2)

AI affected:

CP/HW team requires KMD insert FRAME_CONTROL(end) after
the last IB and before the fence of this DMAframe.

this is to make sure the cache are flushed, and it's a must
change no matter MCBP/SR-IOV or bare-metal case because new
CP hw won't do the cache flush for each IB anymore, it just
leaves it to KMD now.

with this patch, certain MCBP hang issue when rendering
vulkan/chained-ib are resolved.

v2: drop gfx8 changes.  gfx8 is not affected (Alex)
