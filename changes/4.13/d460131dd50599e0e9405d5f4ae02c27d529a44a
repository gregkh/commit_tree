x86/build: Silence the build with "make -s"

Every kernel build on x86 will result in some output:

  Setup is 13084 bytes (padded to 13312 bytes).
  System is 4833 kB
  CRC 6d35fa35
  Kernel: arch/x86/boot/bzImage is ready  (#2)

This shuts it up, so that 'make -s' is truely silent as long as
everything works. Building without '-s' should produce unchanged
output.
