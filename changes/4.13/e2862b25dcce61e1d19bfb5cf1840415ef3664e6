hwspinlock.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Adjust title markups;
- remove explicit numeration from titles;
- mark literal blocks as such;
- replace _foo_ by **foo** for emphasis;
- adjust whitespaces and add blank lines where needed.
