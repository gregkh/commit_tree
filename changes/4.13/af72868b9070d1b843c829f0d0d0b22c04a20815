networking: make skb_pull & friends return void pointers

It seems like a historic accident that these return unsigned char *,
and in many places that means casts are required, more often than not.

Make these functions return void * and remove all the casts across
the tree, adding a (u8 *) cast only where the unsigned char pointer
was used directly, all done with the following spatch:
