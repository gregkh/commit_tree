net: use skb->csum_not_inet to identify packets needing crc32c

skb->csum_not_inet carries the indication on which algorithm is needed to
compute checksum on skb in the transmit path, when skb->ip_summed is equal
to CHECKSUM_PARTIAL. If skb carries a SCTP packet and crc32c hasn't been
yet written in L4 header, skb->csum_not_inet is assigned to 1; otherwise,
assume Internet Checksum is needed and thus set skb->csum_not_inet to 0.
