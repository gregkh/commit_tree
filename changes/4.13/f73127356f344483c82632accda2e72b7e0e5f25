fs/fcntl: return -ESRCH in f_setown when pid/pgid can't be found

The current implementation of F_SETOWN doesn't properly vet the argument
passed in and only returns an error if INT_MIN is passed in. If the
argument doesn't specify a valid pid/pgid, then we just end up cleaning
out the file->f_owner structure.

What we really want is to only clean that out only in the case where
userland passed in an argument of 0. For anything else, we want to
return ESRCH if it doesn't refer to a valid pid.
