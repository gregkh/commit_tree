nbd: only set sndtimeo if we have a timeout set

A user reported that he was getting immediate disconnects with my
sndtimeo patch applied.  This is because by default the OSS nbd client
doesn't set a timeout, so we end up setting the sndtimeo to 0, which of
course means we have send errors a lot.  Instead only set our sndtimeo
if the user specified a timeout, otherwise we'll just wait forever like
we did previously.
