watchdog: it87: Drop support for resetting watchdog though CIR and Game port

Resetting the watchdog timer on CIR interrupts or on game port interrupts
is not not supported on recent chips, and doesn't really tell if the system
is stable. On top of that, at least the bit to enable resetting the
watchdog through the game port is used differently on recent chips.
Drop resetting the watchdog on CIR  or game port interrupts to simplify
the code.
