KVM: s390: sthyi: fix specification exception detection

sthyi should only generate a specification exception if the function
code is zero and the response buffer is not on a 4k boundary.

The current code would also test for unknown function codes if the
response buffer, that is currently only defined for function code 0,
is not on a 4k boundary and incorrectly inject a specification
exception instead of returning with condition code 3 and return code 4
(unsupported function code).

Fix this by moving the boundary check.
