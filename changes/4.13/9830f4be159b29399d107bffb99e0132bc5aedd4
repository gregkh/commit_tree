fs: Use RWF_* flags for AIO operations

aio_rw_flags is introduced in struct iocb (using aio_reserved1) which will
carry the RWF_* flags. We cannot use aio_flags because they are not
checked for validity which may break existing applications.

Note, the only place RWF_HIPRI comes in effect is dio_await_one().
All the rest of the locations, aio code return -EIOCBQUEUED before the
checks for RWF_HIPRI.
