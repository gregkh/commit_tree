itimer: Make timeval to nsec conversion range limited

The expiry time of a itimer is supplied through sys_setitimer() via a
struct timeval. The timeval is validated for correctness.

In the actual set timer implementation the timeval is converted to a
scalar nanoseconds value. If the tv_sec part of the time spec is large
enough the conversion to nanoseconds (sec * NSEC_PER_SEC) overflows 64bit.

Mitigate that by using the timeval_to_ktime() conversion function, which
checks the tv_sec part for a potential mult overflow and clamps the result
to KTIME_MAX, which is about 292 years.
