pinctrl: mcp23s08: switch to regmap caching

Instead of using custom caching, this switches to regmap based
caching. Before the conversion the debugfs file used uncached
values, so that it was easily possible to see power-loss related
problems. The new code will check and recover at this place.

The patch will also ensure, that irqs are not cleared by checking
register status in debugfs.
