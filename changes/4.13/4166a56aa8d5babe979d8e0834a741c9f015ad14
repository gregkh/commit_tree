ARM/dmaengine: pl08x: pass reasonable memcpy settings

We cannot use bits from configuration registers as API between
platforms and driver like this, abstract it out to two enums
and mimic the stuff passed as device tree data.

This is done to make it possible for the driver to generate the
ccfg word on-the-fly so we can support more PL08x derivatives.
