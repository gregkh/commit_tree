powerpc/mm/radix: Only add X for pages overlapping kernel text

Currently we map the whole linear mapping with PAGE_KERNEL_X. Instead we
should check if the page overlaps the kernel text and only then add
PAGE_KERNEL_X.

Note that we still use 1G pages if they're available, so this will
typically still result in a 1G executable page at KERNELBASE. So this fix is
primarily useful for catching stray branches to high linear mapping addresses.

Without this patch, we can execute at 1G in xmon using:

  0:mon> m c000000040000000
  c000000040000000  00 l
  c000000040000000  00000000 01006038
  c000000040000004  00000000 2000804e
  c000000040000008  00000000 x
  0:mon> di c000000040000000
  c000000040000000  38600001      li      r3,1
  c000000040000004  4e800020      blr
  0:mon> p c000000040000000
  return value is 0x1

After we get a 400 as expected:

  0:mon> p c000000040000000
  *** 400 exception occurred
