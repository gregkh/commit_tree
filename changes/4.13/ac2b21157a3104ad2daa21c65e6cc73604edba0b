mmc: host: omap_hsmmc: Add CMD23 capability to omap_hsmmc driver

omap_hsmmc driver always relied on CMD12 to stop transmission.
However if CMD12 is not issued at the correct timing, the card will
indicate a out of range error. With certain cards in some of the
DRA7 based boards, -EIO error is observed. By Adding CMD23 capability,
the MMC core will send MMC_SET_BLOCK_COUNT command before
MMC_READ_MULTIPLE_BLOCK/MMC_WRITE_MULTIPLE_BLOCK commands.

commit a04e6bae9e6f12 ("mmc: core: check also R1 response for
stop commands") exposed this bug in omap_hsmmc driver.
