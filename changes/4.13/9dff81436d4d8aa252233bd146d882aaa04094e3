[media] atomisp2: off by one in atomisp_s_input()

The isp->inputs[] array has isp->input_cnt elements which have been
initialized so this > should be >=.

This bug is harmless.  The check against ATOM_ISP_MAX_INPUTS prevents us
from reading beyond the end of the array.  The uninitialized elements
are zeroed out so we will end up returning -EINVAL a few lines later
because the .camera pointer is NULL.
