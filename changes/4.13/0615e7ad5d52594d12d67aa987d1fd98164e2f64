mtd: nand: denali: remove Toshiba and Hynix specific fixup code

The Denali IP can automatically detect device parameters such as
page size, oob size, device width, etc. and this driver currently
relies on it.  However, this hardware function is known to be
problematic.

[1] Due to a hardware bug, various misdetected cases were reported.
    That is why get_toshiba_nand_para() and get_hynix_nand_para()
    exist to fix-up the misdetected parameters.  It is not realistic
    to add a new NAND device to the *black list* every time we are
    hit by a misdetected case.  We would never be able to guarantee
    that all cases are covered.

[2] Because this feature is unreliable, it is disabled on some
    platforms.

The nand_scan_ident() detects device parameters in a more tested
way.  The hardware should not set the device parameter registers in
a different, unreliable way.  Instead, set the parameters from the
nand_scan_ident() back to the registers.
