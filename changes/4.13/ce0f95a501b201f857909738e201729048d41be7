rbtree.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Mark document title;
- Use :Author: for authorship;
- mark a sub-section title as such;
- mark literal blocks;
- adjust identation where needed.
