ASoC: rt5677: Reintroduce I2C device IDs

Not all devices with ACPI and this combination of sound devices will
have the required information provided via ACPI.  Reintroduce the I2C
device ID to restore sound functionality on on the Chromebook 'Samus'
model.

[ More background note:
 the commit a36afb0ab648 ("ASoC: rt5677: Introduce proper table...")
 moved the i2c ID probed via ACPI ("RT5677CE:00") to a proper
 acpi_device_id table.  Although the action itself is correct per se,
 the overseen issue is the reference id->driver_data at
 rt5677_i2c_probe() for retrieving the corresponding chip model for
 the given id.  Since id=NULL is passed for ACPI matching case, we get
 an Oops now.

 We already have queued more fixes for 4.14 and they already address
 the issue, but they are bigger changes that aren't preferable for the
 late 4.13-rc stage.  So, this patch just papers over the bug as a
 once-off quick fix for a particular ACPI matching.  -- tiwai ]
