cgroup: fix error return value from cgroup_subtree_control()

While refactoring, f7b2814bb9b6 ("cgroup: factor out
cgroup_{apply|finalize}_control() from
cgroup_subtree_control_write()") broke error return value from the
function.  The return value from the last operation is always
overridden to zero.  Fix it.
