ext4: retry storing value in external inode with xattr block too

When value size is <= EXT4_XATTR_MIN_LARGE_EA_SIZE(), and it
doesn't fit in either inline or xattr block, a second try is made to
store it in an external inode while storing the entry itself in inline
area. There should also be an attempt to store the entry in xattr block.

This patch adds a retry loop to do that. It also makes the caller the
sole decider on whether to store a value in an external inode.
