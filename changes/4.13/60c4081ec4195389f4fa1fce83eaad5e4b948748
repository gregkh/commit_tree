crypto: inside-secure - fix the sha state length in hmac_sha1_setkey

A check is performed on the ipad/opad in the safexcel_hmac_sha1_setkey
function, but the index used by the loop doing it is wrong. It is
currently the size of the state array while it should be the size of a
sha1 state. This patch fixes it.
