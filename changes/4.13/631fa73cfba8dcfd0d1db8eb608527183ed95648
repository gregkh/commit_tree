mmc: renesas-sdhi, tmio: make dma more modular

Refactor DMA support to allow it to be provided by a set of call-backs
that are provided by a host driver. The motivation is to allow multiple
DMA implementations to be provided and instantiated at run-time.

Instantiate the existing DMA implementation from the sh_mobile_sdhi driver
which appears to match the current use-case. This has the side effect
of moving the DMA code from the tmio_core to the sh_mobile_sdhi driver.

A follow-up patch will change the source file for the SDHI DMA
implementation accordingly. Another follow-up patch will re-organise the
SDHI driver removing the need for tmio_mmc_get_dma_ops().
