ALSA: pcm: Skip ack callback without actual appl_ptr update

We call ack callback whenever appl_ptr gets updated via
pcm_lib_apply_appl_ptr().  There are various code paths to call this
function.  A part of them are for read/write/forward/rewind, where the
appl_ptr is always changed and thus the call of ack is mandatory.
OTOH, another part of code paths are from the explicit user call,
e.g. via SYNC_PTR ioctl.  There, we may receive the same appl_ptr
value, and in such a case, calling ack is obviously superfluous.

This patch adds the check of the given appl_ptr value, and returns
immediately if it's no real update.
