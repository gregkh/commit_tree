lib/mpi: kunmap after finishing accessing buffer

Using sg_miter_start and sg_miter_next, the buffer of an SG is kmap'ed
to *buff. The current code calls sg_miter_stop (and thus kunmap) on the
SG entry before the last access of *buff.

The patch moves the sg_miter_stop call after the last access to *buff to
ensure that the memory pointed to by *buff is still mapped.
