ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Add deep buffer support

With this patch, the dma buffer size is fetched from topology binary. This
buffer size is applicable for gateway copier modules.

Now that we can configure DSP dma buffer size, the device can support deep
buffer playback. DSP fetches large buffer and can result fewer wakes,
which helps in power reduction.
