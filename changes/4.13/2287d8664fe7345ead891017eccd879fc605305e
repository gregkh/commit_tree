timers: Make the cpu base lock raw

The timers cpu base lock could not be converted to a raw spinlock becaue
the lock held time was non-deterministic due to cascading and long lasting
timer wheel traversals.

The rework of the timer wheel to the new non-cascading model removed also
the wheel traversals and the lock held times are deterministic now. This
allows to make the lock raw and thereby unbreaks NOHz* on preempt-RT.
