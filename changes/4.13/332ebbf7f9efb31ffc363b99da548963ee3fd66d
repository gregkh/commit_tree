block: Document what queue type each function is intended for

Some functions in block/blk-core.c must only be used on blk-sq queues
while others are safe to use against any queue type. Document which
functions are intended for blk-sq queues and issue a warning if the
blk-sq API is misused. This does not only help block driver authors
but will also make it easier to remove the blk-sq code once that code
is declared obsolete.
