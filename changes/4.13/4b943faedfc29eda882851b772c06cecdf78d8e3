udp/v6: prefetch rmem_alloc in udp6_queue_rcv_skb()

very similar to commit dd99e425be23 ("udp: prefetch
rmem_alloc in udp_queue_rcv_skb()"), this allows saving a cache
miss when the BH is bottle-neck for UDP over ipv6 packet
processing, e.g. for small packets when a single RX NIC ingress
queue is in use.

Performances under flood when multiple NIC RX queues used are
unaffected, but when a single NIC rx queue is in use, this
gives ~8% performance improvement.
