vxlan: allow multiple VXLANs with same VNI for IPv6 link-local addresses

As link-local addresses are only valid for a single interface, we can allow
to use the same VNI for multiple independent VXLANs, as long as the used
interfaces are distinct. This way, VXLANs can always be used as a drop-in
replacement for VLANs with greater ID space.

This also extends VNI lookup to respect the ifindex when link-local IPv6
addresses are used, so using the same VNI on multiple interfaces can
actually work.
