gpu: host1x: Forbid unrelated SETCLASS opcode in the firewall

Several channels could be made to write the same unit concurrently via
the SETCLASS opcode, trusting userspace is a bad idea. It should be
possible to drop the per-client channel reservation and add a per-unit
locking by inserting MLOCK's to the command stream to re-allow the
SETCLASS opcode, but it will be much more work. Let's forbid the
unit-unrelated class changes for now.
