ACPI / EC: Add parameter to force disable the GPE on suspend

After commit 8110dd281e15 (ACPI / sleep: EC-based wakeup from
suspend-to-idle on recent systems) the configuration of GPEs,
including the EC one, is not changed during suspend-to-idle on
recent systems.  That's in order to make system wakeup events
generated by the EC work, in particular.

However, on some of the systems in question (for example on Dell
XPS13 9365), in addition to generating system wakeup events the
EC generates a heartbeat sequence of interrupts that have nothing
to do with wakeup while suspended, and the Low Power Idle S0 _DSM
interface doesn't change that behavior.

The users of those systems may prefer to disable the EC GPE during
system suspend, for the cost of non-functional power button wakeup
or similar, but currently there is no way to do that.

For this reason, add a new module parameter, ec_no_wakeup, for the
EC driver module that, if set, will cause the EC GPE to be disabled
during system suspend and re-enabled during the subsequent system
resume.
