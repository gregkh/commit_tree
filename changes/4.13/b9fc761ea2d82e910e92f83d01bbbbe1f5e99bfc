ext4: strong binding of xattr inode references

To verify that a xattr entry is not pointing to the wrong xattr inode,
we currently check that the target inode has EXT4_EA_INODE_FL flag set and
also the entry size matches the target inode size.

For stronger validation, also incorporate crc32c hash of the value into
the e_hash field. This is done regardless of whether the entry lives in
the inode body or external attribute block.
