ipv4: better IP_MAX_MTU enforcement

While working on yet another syzkaller report, I found
that our IP_MAX_MTU enforcements were not properly done.

gcc seems to reload dev->mtu for min(dev->mtu, IP_MAX_MTU), and
final result can be bigger than IP_MAX_MTU :/

This is a problem because device mtu can be changed on other cpus or
threads.

While this patch does not fix the issue I am working on, it is
probably worth addressing it.
