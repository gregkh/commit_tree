Revert "arm64: dts: marvell: add dma-mask in crypto nodes for 7k/8k"

As I found by chance while merging another patch, the usage of
a dma-mask in this DT node is wrong for multiple reasons:

- dma-masks are a Linux specific concept, not a general
  hardware feature
- In DT, we use the "dma-ranges" property to describe how DMA
  addresses related between devices.
- The 40-bit mask appears to be completely unnecessary here, as
  the SoC cannot address that much memory anyway, so simply
  asking for a 64-bit mask (as supported by the device) should
  succeed anyway.

The patch to remove the parsing of the property is getting merged
through the crypto tree.
