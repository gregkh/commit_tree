net: ibm: ibmveth: constify dev_pm_ops structures.

dev_pm_ops are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with dev_pm_ops provided by <linux/device.h> work with const
dev_pm_ops. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size before:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  15426	   1256	      0	  16682	   412a	drivers/net/ethernet/ibm/ibmveth.o

File size After adding 'const':
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
  15618	   1064	      0	  16682	   412a	drivers/net/ethernet/ibm/ibmveth.o
