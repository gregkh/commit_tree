s390/cputime: simplify account_system_index_scaled

The account_system_index_scaled gets two cputime values, a raw value
derived from CPU timer deltas and a scaled value. The scaled value
is always calculated from the raw value, the code can be simplified
by moving the scale_vtime call into account_system_index_scaled.
