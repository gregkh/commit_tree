sync_file.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:
- Use markup for document title and authorship;
- Mark literal blocks;
- Use a numbered list for references.
