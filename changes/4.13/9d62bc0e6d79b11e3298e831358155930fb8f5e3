tcmu: Fix flushing cmd entry dcache page

When feeding the tcmu's cmd ring, we need to flush the dcache page
for the cmd entry to make sure these kernel stores are visible to
user space mappings of that page.

For the none PAD cmd entry, this will be flushed at the end of the
tcmu_queue_cmd_ring().
