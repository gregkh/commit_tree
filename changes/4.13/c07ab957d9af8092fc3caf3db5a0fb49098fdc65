arm64: Call __show_regs directly

Generic code expects show_regs() to also dump the stack, but arm64's
show_reg() does not do this. Some arm64 callers of show_regs() *only*
want the registers dumped, without the stack.

To enable generic code to work as expected, we need to make
show_regs() dump the stack. Where we only want the registers dumped,
we must use __show_regs().

This patch updates code to use __show_regs() where only registers are
desired. A subsequent patch will modify show_regs().
