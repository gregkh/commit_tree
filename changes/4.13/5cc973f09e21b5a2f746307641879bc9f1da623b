scsi: aacraid: fix leak of data from stack back to userspace

The fields sense_data_size and sense_data are unitialized garbage from
the stack and are being copied back to userspace.  Fix this leak of
stack information by ensuring they are zero'd.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1435473 ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
