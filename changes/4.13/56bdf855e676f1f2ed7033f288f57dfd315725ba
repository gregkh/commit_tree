xfs: Fix per-inode DAX flag inheritance

According to the commit that implemented per-inode DAX flag:
commit 58f88ca2df72 ("xfs: introduce per-inode DAX enablement")
the flag is supposed to act as "inherit flag".

Currently this only works in the situations where parent directory
already has a flag in di_flags set, otherwise inheritance does not
work. This is because setting the XFS_DIFLAG2_DAX flag is done in a
wrong branch designated for di_flags, not di_flags2.

Fix this by moving the code to branch designated for setting di_flags2,
which does test for flags in di_flags2.
