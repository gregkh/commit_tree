sched/cputime: Rename vtime fields

The current "snapshot" based naming on vtime fields suggests we record
some past event but that's a low level picture of their actual purpose
which comes out blurry. The real point of these fields is to run a basic
state machine that tracks down cputime entry while switching between
contexts.

So lets reflect that with more meaningful names.
