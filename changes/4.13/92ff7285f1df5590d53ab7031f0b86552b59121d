xfs: reflink find shared should take a transaction

Adapt _reflink_find_shared to take an optional transaction pointer.  The
inode scrubber code will need to decide (within transaction context) if
a file has shared blocks.  To avoid buffer deadlocks, we must pass the
tp through to this function's utility calls.
