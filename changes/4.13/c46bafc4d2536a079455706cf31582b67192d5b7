parisc: Show DIMM slot number which holds broken memory module

The Page Deallocation Table (PDT) holds the physical addresses of all broken
memory addresses. With the physical address we now are able to show which DIMM
slot (e.g. 1a, 3c) actually holds the broken memory module so that users are
able to replace it.
