x86/tsc: Call check_system_tsc_reliable() before unsynchronized_tsc()

tsc_clocksource_reliable is initialized in check_system_tsc_reliable(), but
it is checked in unsynchronized_tsc() which is called before the
initialization.

In practice that's not an issue because systems which mark the TSC
reliable have X86_FEATURE_CONSTANT_TSC set as well, which is evaluated
in unsynchronized_tsc() before tsc_clocksource_reliable.

Reorder the calls so initialization happens before usage.
