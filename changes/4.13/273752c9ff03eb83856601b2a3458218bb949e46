dm, dax: Make sure dm_dax_flush() is called if device supports it

Currently dm_dax_flush() is not being called, even if underlying dax
device supports write cache, because DAXDEV_WRITE_CACHE is not being
propagated up to the DM dax device.

If the underlying dax device supports write cache, set
DAXDEV_WRITE_CACHE on the DM dax device.  This will cause dm_dax_flush()
to be called.
