platform/x86: wmi: Turn WMI into a bus driver

WMI is logically a bus: the WMI driver binds to an ACPI node (or
more than one), and each instance of the WMI driver enumerates its
children and hopes that drivers will attach to the children that are
useful.

This patch gives WMI a driver model bus type and the ability to
match to drivers. The bus itself is a device in the new "wmi_bus"
class, and all of the individual WMI devices are slotted into the
device hierarchy correctly.
