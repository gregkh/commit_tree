cifs: Do not modify mid entry after submitting I/O in cifs_call_async

In cifs_call_async, server may respond as soon as I/O is submitted. Because
mid entry is freed on the return path, it should not be modified after I/O
is submitted.

cifs_save_when_sent modifies the sent timestamp in mid entry, and should not
be called after I/O. Call it before I/O.
