ASoC: add audio-graph-scu-card support

OF-graph base DT binding is used on V4L2, and ALSA SoC is using
different style of DT today. Now ALSA SoC supports simple-card driver
for generic/simple sound card, and we have simple-scu-card driver
for simple-card + ALSA DPCM case.
In the future, V4L2 / ALSA will support HDMI, and then, DT bindings
between V4L2 / ALSA should be merged.
This patch adds new Audio Graph SCU Card which is OF-graph base of
simple-scu-card
