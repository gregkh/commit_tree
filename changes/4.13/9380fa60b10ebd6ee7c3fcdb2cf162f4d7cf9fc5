kernel/sysctl_binary.c: check name array length in deprecated_sysctl_warning()

Prevent use of uninitialized memory (originating from the stack frame of
do_sysctl()) by verifying that the name array is filled with sufficient
input data before comparing its specific entries with integer constants.

Through timing measurement or analyzing the kernel debug logs, a
user-mode program could potentially infer the results of comparisons
against the uninitialized memory, and acquire some (very limited)
information about the state of the kernel stack.  The change also
eliminates possible future warnings by tools such as KMSAN and other
code checkers / instrumentations.
