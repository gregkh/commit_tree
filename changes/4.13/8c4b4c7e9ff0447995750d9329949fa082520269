bpf: Add setsockopt helper function to bpf

Added support for calling a subset of socket setsockopts from
BPF_PROG_TYPE_SOCK_OPS programs. The code was duplicated rather
than making the changes to call the socket setsockopt function because
the changes required would have been larger.

The ops supported are:
  SO_RCVBUF
  SO_SNDBUF
  SO_MAX_PACING_RATE
  SO_PRIORITY
  SO_RCVLOWAT
  SO_MARK
