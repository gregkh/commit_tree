gpu: ipu-v3: vdic: include AUTO field order bit in ipu_vdi_set_field_order

The field order selection in VDIC_C register uses different bits
depending on whether the VDIC is receiving from a CSI ("AUTO") or
from memory ("MAN"). Since the VDIC cannot receive from both CSI
and memory at the same time, set or clear both field order bits to
cover both cases.
