usb: usbip tool: Check the return of get_nports()

If we get nonpositive number of ports, there is no sense to
continue, then fail gracefully.

In addition, the commit 0775a9cbc694e8c72 ("usbip: vhci extension:
modifications to vhci driver") introduced configurable numbers of
controllers and ports, but we have a static port number maximum,
MAXNPORT. If exceeded, the idev array will be overflown. We fix
it by validating the nports to make sure the port number max is
not exceeded.
