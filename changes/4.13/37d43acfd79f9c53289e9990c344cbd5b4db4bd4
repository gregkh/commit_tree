x86/mce/AMD: Redo error logging from APIC LVT interrupt handlers

We have support for the new SMCA MCA_DE{STAT,ADDR} registers in Linux.
So we've used these registers in place of MCA_{STATUS,ADDR} on SMCA
systems.

However, the guidance for current SMCA implementations of is to continue
using MCA_{STATUS,ADDR} and to use MCA_DE{STAT,ADDR} only if a Deferred
error was not found in the former registers. If we logged a Deferred
error in MCA_STATUS then we should also clear MCA_DESTAT. This also
means we shouldn't clear MCA_CONFIG[LogDeferredInMcaStat].

Rework __log_error() to only log an error and add helpers for the
different error types being logged from the corresponding interrupt
handlers.

Boris: carve out common functionality into a _log_error_bank(). Cleanup
comments, check MCi_STATUS bits before reading MSRs. Streamline flow.
