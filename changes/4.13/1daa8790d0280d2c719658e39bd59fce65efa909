virtio_net: fix truesize for mergeable buffers

Seth Forshee noticed a performance degradation with some workloads.
This turns out to be due to packet drops.  Euan Kemp noticed that this
is because we drop all packets where length exceeds the truesize, but
for some packets we add in extra memory without updating the truesize.
This in turn was kept around unchanged from ab7db91705e95 ("virtio-net:
auto-tune mergeable rx buffer size for improved performance").  That
commit had an internal reason not to account for the extra space: not
enough bits to do it.  No longer true so let's account for the allocated
length exactly.

Many thanks to Seth Forshee for the report and bisecting and Euan Kemp
for debugging the issue.
