perf/x86: Shut up false-positive -Wmaybe-uninitialized warning

The intialization function checks for various failure scenarios, but
unfortunately the compiler gets a little confused about the possible
combinations, leading to a false-positive build warning when
-Wmaybe-uninitialized is set:

  arch/x86/events/core.c: In function ‘init_hw_perf_events’:
  arch/x86/events/core.c:264:3: warning: ‘reg_fail’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
  arch/x86/events/core.c:264:3: warning: ‘val_fail’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
     pr_err(FW_BUG "the BIOS has corrupted hw-PMU resources (MSR %x is %Lx)\n",

We can't actually run into this case, so this shuts up the warning
by initializing the variables to a known-invalid state.
