ASoC: rt5645: Add quirk override by module option

For making the development easier, add quirk module option to override
the platform data setup.  For example, a platform with inverted jack
detection with jd_mode=2, pass the value 0x21 (0x1 = inv_jd1_1, 0x20 =
jd_mode=2).  It overrides the whole pdata fields, so pass it
carefully.
