srcu: Apply trivial callback lists to shrink Tiny SRCU

The rcu_segcblist structure provides quite a bit of functionality, and
Tiny SRCU needs almost none of it.  So this commit replaces Tiny SRCU's
uses of rcu_segcblist with a simple singly linked list with tail pointer.
This change significantly reduces Tiny SRCU's memory footprint, more
than making up for the growth caused by the creation of rcu_segcblist.c
