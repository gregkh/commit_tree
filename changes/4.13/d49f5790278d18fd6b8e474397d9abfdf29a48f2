mtd: nand: denali: use interrupt instead of polling for bank reset

The current bank reset implementation polls the INTR_STATUS register
until interested bits are set.  This is not good because:

- polling simply wastes time-slice of the thread

- The while() loop may continue eternally if no bit is set, for
  example, due to the controller problem.  The denali_wait_for_irq()
  uses wait_for_completion_timeout(), which is safer.

We can use interrupt by moving the denali_reset_bank() call below
the interrupt setup.
