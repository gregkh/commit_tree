cpufreq: intel_pstate: report correct CPU frequencies during trace

The intel_pstate CPU frequency scaling driver has always
calculated CPU frequency incorrectly.  Recent changes have
eliminted most of the issues, however the frequency reported
in the trace buffer, if used, is incorrect.

It remains desireable that cpu->pstate.scaling still be a nice
round number for things such as when setting max and min frequencies.
So the proposal is to just fix the reported frequency in the trace data.

Fixes what remains of [1].
