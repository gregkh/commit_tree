arm64: ptrace: Fix VFP register dumping in compat coredumps

Currently, VFP registers are omitted from coredumps for compat
processes, due to a bug in the REGSET_COMPAT_VFP regset
implementation.

compat_vfp_get() needs to transfer non-contiguous data from
thread_struct.fpsimd_state, and uses put_user() to handle the
offending trailing word (FPSCR).  This fails when copying to a
kernel address (i.e., kbuf && !ubuf), which is what happens when
dumping core.  As a result, the ELF coredump core code silently
omits the NT_ARM_VFP note from the dump.

It would be possible to work around this with additional special
case code for the put_user(), but since user_regset_copyout() is
explicitly designed to handle this scenario it is cleaner to port
the put_user() to a user_regset_copyout() call, which this patch
does.
