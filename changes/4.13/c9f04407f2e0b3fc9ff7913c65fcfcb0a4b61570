KVM: nVMX: mark vmcs12 pages dirty on L2 exit

The host physical addresses of L1's Virtual APIC Page and Posted
Interrupt descriptor are loaded into the VMCS02. The CPU may write
to these pages via their host physical address while L2 is running,
bypassing address-translation-based dirty tracking (e.g. EPT write
protection). Mark them dirty on every exit from L2 to prevent them
from getting out of sync with dirty tracking.

Also mark the virtual APIC page and the posted interrupt descriptor
dirty when KVM is virtualizing posted interrupt processing.
