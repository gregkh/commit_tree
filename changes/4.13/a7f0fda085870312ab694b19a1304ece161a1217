perf unwind: Support for powerpc

Porting PPC to libdw only needs an architecture-specific hook to move
the register state from perf to libdw.

The ARM and x86 architectures already use libdw, and it is useful to
have as much common code for the unwinder as possible.  Mark Wielaard
has contributed a frame-based unwinder to libdw, so that unwinding works
even for binaries that do not have CFI information.  In addition,
libunwind is always preferred to libdw by the build machinery so this
cannot introduce regressions on machines that have both libunwind and
libdw installed.
