ACPI / video: Add quirks for the Dell Precision 7510

The Dell Precision 7510 has a broken acpi-video implementation.

The backlight control bits work, but when the brightness is changed via
the acpi-video interface the backlight flickers annoyingly before settling
at the new brightness, switching to using the native interface fixes the
flickering so add a quirk for this (the vendor interface can not change the
brightness at all).
