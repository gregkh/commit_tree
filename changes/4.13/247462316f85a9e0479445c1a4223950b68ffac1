parisc: Report SIGSEGV instead of SIGBUS when running out of stack

When a process runs out of stack the parisc kernel wrongly faults with SIGBUS
instead of the expected SIGSEGV signal.

This example shows how the kernel faults:
do_page_fault() command='a.out' type=15 address=0xfaac2000 in libc-2.24.so[f8308000+16c000]
trap #15: Data TLB miss fault, vm_start = 0xfa2c2000, vm_end = 0xfaac2000

The vma->vm_end value is the first address which does not belong to the vma, so
adjust the check to include vma->vm_end to the range for which to send the
SIGSEGV signal.

This patch unbreaks building the debian libsigsegv package.
