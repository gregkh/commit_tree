net/mlx5: FPGA, Add SBU infrastructure

Add interface to initialize and interact with Innova FPGA SBU
connections.
A client driver may use these functions to set up a high-speed DMA
connection with its SBU hardware logic, and send/receive messages
over this connection.

A later patch in this patchset will make use of these functions for
Innova IPSec offload in mlx5 Ethernet driver.

Add commands to retrieve Innova FPGA SBU capabilities, and to
read/write Innova FPGA configuration space registers and memory,
over internal I2C.

At high level, the FPGA configuration space is divided such:
 0x00000000 - 0x007fffff is reserved for the SBU
 0x00800000 - 0xffffffff is reserved for the Shell
0x400000000 - ...        is DDR memory

A later patchset will add support for accessing FPGA CrSpace and memory
over a high-speed connection. This is the reason for the ACCESS_TYPE
enumeration, which currently only supports I2C.
