iommu/io-pgtable-arm-v7s: Refactor split_blk_unmap

Whilst the short-descriptor format's split_blk_unmap implementation has
no need to be recursive, it followed the pattern of the LPAE version
anyway for the sake of consistency. With the latter now reworked for
both efficiency and future scalability improvements, tweak the former
similarly, not least to make it less obtuse.
