tcp_bbr: remove sk_pacing_rate=0 transient during init

Fix a corner case noticed by Eric Dumazet, where BBR's setting
sk->sk_pacing_rate to 0 during initialization could theoretically
cause packets in the sending host to hang if there were packets "in
flight" in the pacing infrastructure at the time the BBR congestion
control state is initialized. This could occur if the pacing
infrastructure happened to race with bbr_init() in a way such that the
pacer read the 0 rather than the immediately following non-zero pacing
rate.
