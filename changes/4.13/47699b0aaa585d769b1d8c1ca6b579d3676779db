usb: musb: tusb6010: Handle DMA TX completion in DMA callback as well

Handle the DMA TX in a similar way as we do for the RX: in the DMA
completion callback.

Since we are no longer using DMA completion interrupt for the TX we can as
wall keep these interrupts disabled, but keep the handler for debug
purposes.
