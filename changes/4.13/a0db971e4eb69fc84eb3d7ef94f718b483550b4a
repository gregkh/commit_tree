nohz: Move idle balancer registration to the idle path

The idle load balancing registration path assumes that we only stop the
tick when the CPU is idle, ignoring the nohz full case. As a result, a
nohz full CPU that is running a task may be chosen to perform idle load
balancing.

Lets make sure that only CPUs in dynticks idle mode can be picked as
idle load balancers.
