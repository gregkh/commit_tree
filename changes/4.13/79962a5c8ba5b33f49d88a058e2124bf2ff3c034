KVM: arm/arm64: Fix bug in advertising KVM_CAP_MSI_DEVID capability

Commit 0e4e82f154e3 ("KVM: arm64: vgic-its: Enable ITS emulation as
a virtual MSI controller") tried to advertise KVM_CAP_MSI_DEVID, but
the code logic was not updating the dist->msis_require_devid field
correctly. If hypervisor tool creates the ITS device after VGIC
initialization then we don't advertise KVM_CAP_MSI_DEVID capability.

Update the field msis_require_devid to true inside vgic_its_create()
to fix the issue.
