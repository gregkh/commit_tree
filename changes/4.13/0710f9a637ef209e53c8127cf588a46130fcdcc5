KVM: arm/arm64: Use uaccess functions for GICv3 {sc}active

We recently rewrote the sactive and cactive handlers to take the kvm
lock for guest accesses to these registers.  However, when accessed from
userspace this lock is already held.  Unfortunately we forgot to change
the private accessors for GICv3, because these are redistributor
registers and not distributor registers.
