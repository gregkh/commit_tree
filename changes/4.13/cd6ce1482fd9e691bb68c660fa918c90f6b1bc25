block: Make request operation type argument declarations consistent

Instead of declaring the second argument of blk_*_get_request()
as int and passing it to functions that expect an unsigned int,
declare that second argument as unsigned int. Also because of
consistency, rename that second argument from 'rw' into 'op'.
This patch does not change any functionality.
