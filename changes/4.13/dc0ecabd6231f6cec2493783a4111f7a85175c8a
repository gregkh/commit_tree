net: switchdev: Add support for querying supported bridge flags by hardware

This is done as a preparation stage before setting the bridge port flags
from the bridge code. Currently the device can be queried for the bridge
flags state, but the querier cannot distinguish if the flag is disabled
or if it is not supported at all. Thus, add new attr and a bit-mask which
include information regarding the support on a per-flag basis.

Drivers that support bridge offload but not support bridge flags should
return zeroed bitmask.
