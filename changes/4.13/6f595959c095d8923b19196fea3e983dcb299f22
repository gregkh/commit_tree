amd-xgbe: Adjust register settings to improve performance

Add support to change some general performance settings and to provide
some performance settings based on the device that is probed.

This includes:

- Setting the maximum read/write outstanding request limit
- Reducing the AXI interface burst length size
- Selectively setting the Tx and Rx descriptor pre-fetch threshold
- Selectively setting additional cache coherency controls

Tested and verified on all versions of the hardware.
