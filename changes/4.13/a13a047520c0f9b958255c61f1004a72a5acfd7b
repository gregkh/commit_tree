ARM: mini2440_defconfig: Save defconfig

Generate new defconfig to get rid of obsolete Kconfig entries:
 - NET_ETHERNET, SND_S3C24XX_SOC are gone;
 - CRYPTO_FIPS is changed to no (cannot be part of module);
 - BINFMT_AOUT cannot be selected anymore;
 - rest of entries is being removed by default values;
