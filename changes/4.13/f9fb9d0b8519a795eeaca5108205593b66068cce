net/mlx4_core: Fix namespace misalignment in QinQ VST support commit

The cited commit introduced the following new enum value in file
include/linux/mlx4/device.h:

    MLX4_DEV_CAP_FLAG2_SVLAN_BY_QP

However the value of MLX4_DEV_CAP_FLAG2_SVLAN_BY_QP needs to stay
consistent with the value used in another namespace in
function dump_dev_cap_flags2(), which is manually kept in sync.
The change here restores that consistency.
