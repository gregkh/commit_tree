staging: speakup: add tty-based comms functions

This adds spk_ttyio.c file. It contains a set of functions which implement
those methods in spk_synth struct which relate to sending bytes out using
serial comms. Implementations in this file perform the same function but
using TTY subsystem instead. Currently synths access serial ports, directly
poking standard ISA ports by trying to steal them from serial driver. Some ISA
cards actually need this way of doing it, but most other synthesizers don't,
and can actually work by using the proper TTY subsystem through a new N_SPEAKUP
line discipline. So this adds the methods for drivers to switch to accessing
serial ports through the TTY subsystem, whenever appropriate.
