IB/cma: Fix reference count leak when no ipv4 addresses are set

Once in_dev_get is called to receive in_device pointer, the
in_device reference counter is increased, but if there are
no ipv4 addresses configured on the net-device the ifa_list
will be null, resulting in a flow that doesn't call in_dev_put
to decrease the ref_cnt.
This was exposed when running RoCE over ipv6 without any ipv4
addresses configured
