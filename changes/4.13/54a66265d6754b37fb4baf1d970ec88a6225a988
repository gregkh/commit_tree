Drivers: hv: vmbus: Fix rescind handling

Fix the rescind handling. This patch addresses the following rescind
scenario that is currently not handled correctly:

If a rescind were to be received while the offer is still being
peocessed, we will be blocked indefinitely since the rescind message
is handled on the same work element as the offer message. Fix this
issue.

I would like to thank Dexuan Cui <decui@microsoft.com> and
Long Li <longli@microsoft.com> for working with me on this patch.
