time/posix-timers: Move the compat copyouts to the nanosleep implementations

Turn restart_block.nanosleep.{rmtp,compat_rmtp} into a tagged union (kind =
1 -> native, kind = 2 -> compat, kind = 0 -> nothing) and make the places
doing actual copyout handle compat as well as native (that will become a
helper in the next commit).  Result: compat wrappers, messing with
reassignments, etc. are gone.

[ tglx: Folded in a variant of Peter Zijlstras enum patch ]
