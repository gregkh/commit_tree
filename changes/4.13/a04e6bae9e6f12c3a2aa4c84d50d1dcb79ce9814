mmc: core: check also R1 response for stop commands

To detect errors like ECC errors, we must parse the R1 response bits. Introduce
a helper function to also set the error value of a command when R1 error bits
are set. Add ECC error to list of flags checked. Use the new helper for the
stop command to call mmc_blk_recovery when detecting ECC errors which are only
flagged on the next command after multiblock.
