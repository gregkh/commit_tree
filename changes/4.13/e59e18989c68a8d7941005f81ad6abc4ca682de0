iio: accel: bmc150: Always restore device to normal mode after suspend-resume

After probe we would put the device in normal mode, after a runtime
suspend-resume we would put it back in normal mode. But for a regular
suspend-resume we would only put it back in normal mode if triggers
or events have been requested.  This is not consistent and breaks
reading raw values after a suspend-resume.

This commit changes the regular resume path to also unconditionally put
the device back in normal mode, fixing reading of raw values not working
after a regular suspend-resume cycle.
