l2tp: hold tunnel while looking up sessions in l2tp_netlink

l2tp_tunnel_find() doesn't take a reference on the returned tunnel.
Therefore, it's unsafe to use it because the returned tunnel can go
away on us anytime.

Fix this by defining l2tp_tunnel_get(), which works like
l2tp_tunnel_find(), but takes a reference on the returned tunnel.
Caller then has to drop this reference using l2tp_tunnel_dec_refcount().

As l2tp_tunnel_dec_refcount() needs to be moved to l2tp_core.h, let's
simplify the patch and not move the L2TP_REFCNT_DEBUG part. This code
has been broken (not even compiling) in May 2012 by
commit a4ca44fa578c ("net: l2tp: Standardize logging styles")
and fixed more than two years later by
commit 29abe2fda54f ("l2tp: fix missing line continuation"). So it
doesn't appear to be used by anyone.

Same thing for l2tp_tunnel_free(); instead of moving it to l2tp_core.h,
let's just simplify things and call kfree_rcu() directly in
l2tp_tunnel_dec_refcount(). Extra assertions and debugging code
provided by l2tp_tunnel_free() didn't help catching any of the
reference counting and socket handling issues found while working on
this series.
