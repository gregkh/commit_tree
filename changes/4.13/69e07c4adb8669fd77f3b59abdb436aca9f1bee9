blk-mq: update comments on blk_mq_quiesce_queue()

Actually what we want to get from blk_mq_quiesce_queue()
isn't only to wait for completion of all ongoing .queue_rq().

In the typical context of canceling requests, we need to
make sure that the following is done in the dispatch path
before starting to cancel requests:

	- failed dispatched request is finished
	- busy dispatched request is requeued, and the STARTED
	flag is cleared

So update comment to keep code, doc and our expection consistent.
