mm, THP, swap: check whether THP can be split firstly

To swap out THP (Transparent Huage Page), before splitting the THP, the
swap cluster will be allocated and the THP will be added into the swap
cache.  But it is possible that the THP cannot be split, so that we must
delete the THP from the swap cache and free the swap cluster.  To avoid
that, in this patch, whether the THP can be split is checked firstly.
The check can only be done racy, but it is good enough for most cases.

With the patch, the swap out throughput improves 3.6% (from about
4.16GB/s to about 4.31GB/s) in the vm-scalability swap-w-seq test case
with 8 processes.  The test is done on a Xeon E5 v3 system.  The swap
device used is a RAM simulated PMEM (persistent memory) device.  To test
the sequential swapping out, the test case creates 8 processes, which
sequentially allocate and write to the anonymous pages until the RAM and
part of the swap device is used up.
