ipc/shm.c: avoid ipc_rcu_putref for failed ipc_addid()

Loosely based on a patch from Kees Cook <keescook@chromium.org>:
 - id and error can be merged
 - if operations before ipc_addid() fail, then use call_rcu() directly.

The difference is that call_rcu is used for failures after
security_shm_alloc(), to continue to guaranteed an rcu delay for
security_sem_free().
