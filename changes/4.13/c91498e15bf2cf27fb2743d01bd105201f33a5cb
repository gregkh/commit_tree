net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: define membership on VLAN add

Define the target port membership of the VLAN entry in
mv88e6xxx_port_vlan_add where ds is scoped.

Allow the DSA core to call later the port_vlan_add operation for CPU or
DSA ports, by using the Unmodified membership for these ports, as in the
current behavior.
