arm64: exception: handle Synchronous External Abort

SEA exceptions are often caused by an uncorrected hardware
error, and are handled when data abort and instruction abort
exception classes have specific values for their Fault Status
Code.
When SEA occurs, before killing the process, report the error
in the kernel logs.
Update fault_info[] with specific SEA faults so that the
new SEA handler is used.
