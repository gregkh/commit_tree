scsi: qedf: Look at all descriptors when processing a clear virtual link.

If there are multiple descriptors for a particular type in a clear virtual
link we receive, we will not process it correctly but rather take the last
value. This can cause us not to not flap the virtual link as the value from
the descriptors that we compare against the our stored FCF or fc_lport values
may not match.

Change this to do a comparison when processing the each descriptor instead of at
the end and then set a bool if we need to do the reset.
