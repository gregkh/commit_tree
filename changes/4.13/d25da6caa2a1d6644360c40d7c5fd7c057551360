bpf: don't check spilled reg state for non-STACK_SPILLed type slots

spilled_regs[] state is only used for stack slots of type STACK_SPILL,
never for STACK_MISC. Right now, in states_equal(), even if we have
old and current stack state of type STACK_MISC, we compare spilled_regs[]
for that particular offset. Just skip these like we do everywhere else.
