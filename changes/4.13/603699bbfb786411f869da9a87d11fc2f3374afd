static-keys.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:
- Mark titles;
- Add a warning mark;
- Mark literals and literal blocks;
- Adjust identation.
