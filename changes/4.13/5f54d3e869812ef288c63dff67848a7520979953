dmaengine: fsl_raid: make of_device_ids const.

of_device_ids are not supposed to change at runtime. All functions
working with of_device_ids provided by <linux/of.h> work with const
of_device_ids. So mark the non-const structs as const.

File size after constify:
   text	   data	    bss	    dec	    hex	filename
   4381	    192	      0	   4573	   11dd	drivers/dma/fsl_raid.o
