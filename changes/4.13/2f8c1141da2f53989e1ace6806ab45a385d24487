ACPICA: Disassembler: prevent external op's from opening a new scope

ACPICA commit c512c2bfcce65b8e8f37d549ac2fa4a1e0182e46

Since Externals could be of ACPI_TYPE_METHOD, there is a possibility
that the acpi_ns_lookup may cause a new scope to be opened. Therefore,
disable opening the scope for all acpi_ns_lookup invocations that deal
with externals.
