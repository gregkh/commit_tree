[media] ddbridge: board control setup, ts quirk flags

This is a backport of the board control setup from the vendor provided
dddvb driver package, which does additional device initialisation based
on the board_control device info values. Also backports the TS quirk
flags which is used to control setup and usage of the tuner modules
soldered on the bridge cards (e.g. CineCTv7, CineS2 V7, MaxA8 and the
likes).

Functionality originates from ddbridge vendor driver. Permission for
reuse and kernel inclusion was formally granted by Ralph Metzler
