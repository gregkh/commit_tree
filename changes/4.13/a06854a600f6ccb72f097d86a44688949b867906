[media] mceusb: RX -EPIPE (urb status = -32) lockup failure fix

RX -EPIPE failure with infinite loop and flooding of
[ 2851.966506] mceusb 1-1.2:1.0: Error: urb status = -32
log message at 8000 messages per second.
Bug trigger appears to be normal, but heavy, IR receiver use.
Driver and Linux host become unusable after error.

Fix:

Message reports RX usb halt (stall) condition requiring usb_clear_halt()
call in non-interrupt context to recover. Add driver workqueue call to
perform this recovery based on method in use for the usbnet device driver.
