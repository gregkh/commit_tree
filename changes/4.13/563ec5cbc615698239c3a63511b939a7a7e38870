kernel/module.c: use linux/set_memory.h

This header always exists, so doesn't require an ifdef around its
inclusion.  When CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_SET_MEMORY=y it includes the asm
header, otherwise it provides empty versions of the set_memory_xx()
routines.

The usages of set_memory_xx() are still guarded by
CONFIG_STRICT_MODULE_RWX.
