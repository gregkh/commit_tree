net/mlx4_en: don't set CHECKSUM_COMPLETE on SCTP packets

if the NIC fails to validate the checksum on TCP/UDP, and validation of IP
checksum is successful, the driver subtracts the pseudo-header checksum
from the value obtained by the hardware and sets CHECKSUM_COMPLETE. Don't
do that if protocol is IPPROTO_SCTP, otherwise CRC32c validation fails.

V2: don't test MLX4_CQE_STATUS_IPV6 if MLX4_CQE_STATUS_IPV4 is set
