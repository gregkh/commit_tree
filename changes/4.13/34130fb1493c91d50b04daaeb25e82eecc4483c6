drm/amdgpu: refactor MQD/HQD initialization v3

The MQD programming sequence currently exists in 3 different places.
Refactor it to absorb all the duplicates.

The success path remains mostly identical except for a slightly
different order in the non-kiq case. This shouldn't matter if the HQD
is disabled.

The error handling paths have been updated to deal with the new code
structure.

v2: the non-kiq path for gfxv8 was dropped in the rebase
v3: split MEC_HPD_SIZE rename, dropped doorbell changes
