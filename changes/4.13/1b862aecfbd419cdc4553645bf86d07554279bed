mm, memory_hotplug: get rid of is_zone_device_section

Device memory hotplug hooks into regular memory hotplug only half way.
It needs memory sections to track struct pages but there is no
need/desire to associate those sections with memory blocks and export
them to the userspace via sysfs because they cannot be onlined anyway.

This is currently expressed by for_device argument to arch_add_memory
which then makes sure to associate the given memory range with
ZONE_DEVICE.  register_new_memory then relies on is_zone_device_section
to distinguish special memory hotplug from the regular one.  While this
works now, later patches in this series want to move __add_zone outside
of arch_add_memory path so we have to come up with something else.

Add want_memblock down the __add_pages path and use it to control
whether the section->memblock association should be done.
arch_add_memory then just trivially want memblock for everything but
for_device hotplug.

remove_memory_section doesn't need is_zone_device_section either.  We
can simply skip all the memblock specific cleanup if there is no
memblock for the given section.

This shouldn't introduce any functional change.
