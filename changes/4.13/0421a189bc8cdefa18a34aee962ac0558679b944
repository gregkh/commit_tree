ext4: modify ext4_xattr_ino_array to hold struct inode *

Tracking struct inode * rather than the inode number eliminates the
repeated ext4_xattr_inode_iget() call later. The second call cannot
fail in practice but still requires explanation when it wants to ignore
the return value. Avoid the trouble and make things simple.
