sctp: handle errors when updating asoc

It's a bad thing not to handle errors when updating asoc. The memory
allocation failure in any of the functions called in sctp_assoc_update()
would cause sctp to work unexpectedly.

This patch is to fix it by aborting the asoc and reporting the error when
any of these functions fails.
