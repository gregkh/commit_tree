x86/xen: allow userspace access during hypercalls

Userspace application can do a hypercall through /dev/xen/privcmd, and
some for some hypercalls argument is a pointers to user-provided
structure. When SMAP is supported and enabled, hypervisor can't access.
So, lets allow it.

The same applies to HYPERVISOR_dm_op, where additionally privcmd driver
carefully verify buffer addresses.
