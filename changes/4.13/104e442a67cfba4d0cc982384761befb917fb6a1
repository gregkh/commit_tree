mtd: nand: Pass the CS line to ->setup_data_interface()

Some NAND controllers can assign different NAND timings to different
CS lines. Pass the CS line information to ->setup_data_interface() so
that the NAND controller driver knows which CS line is concerned by
the setup_data_interface() request.
