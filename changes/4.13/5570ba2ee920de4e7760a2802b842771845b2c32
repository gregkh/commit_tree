MIPS: CPS: Prevent multi-core with dcache aliasing

Systems using the MIPS Coherence Manager (CM) cannot support multi-core
SMP with dcache aliasing. This is because CPU caches are VIPT, but
interventions in CM-based systems provide only the physical address to
remote caches. This means that interventions may behave incorrectly in
the presence of an aliasing dcache, since the physical address used
when handling an intervention may lead to operation on an aliased cache
line rather than the correct line.

Prevent us from running into this issue by refusing to boot secondary
cores in systems where dcache aliasing may occur.
