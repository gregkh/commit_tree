cgroup: create dfl_root files on subsys registration

On subsystem registration, css_populate_dir() is not called on the new
root css, so the interface files for the subsystem on cgrp_dfl_root
aren't created on registration.  This is a residue from the days when
cgrp_dfl_root was used only as the parking spot for unused subsystems,
which no longer is true as it's used as the root for cgroup2.

This is often fine as later operations tend to create them as a part
of mount (cgroup1) or subtree_control operations (cgroup2); however,
it's not difficult to mount cgroup2 with the controller interface
files missing as Waiman found out.

Fix it by invoking css_populate_dir() on the root css on subsys
registration.
