media: dvb-frontends/cxd2841er: require STATE_ACTIVE_* for agc readout

When the demod driver puts the demod into sleep or shutdown state and it's
status is then polled e.g. via "dvb-fe-tool -m", i2c errors are printed
to the kernel log. If the last delsys was DVB-T/T2:

  cxd2841er: i2c wr failed=-5 addr=6c reg=00 len=1
  cxd2841er: i2c rd failed=-5 addr=6c reg=26

and if it was DVB-C:

  cxd2841er: i2c wr failed=-5 addr=6c reg=00 len=1
  cxd2841er: i2c rd failed=-5 addr=6c reg=49

This happens when read_status unconditionally calls into the
read_signal_strength() function which triggers the read_agc_gain_*()
functions, where these registered are polled.

This isn't a critical thing since when the demod is active again, no more
such errors are logged, however this might make users suspecting defects.

Fix this by requiring STATE_ACTIVE_* in priv->state. If it isn't in any
active state, additionally set the strength scale to NOT_AVAILABLE.
