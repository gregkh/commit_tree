drm/i915: Perform an invalidate prior to executing golden renderstate

As we may have just bound the renderstate into the GGTT for execution, we
need to ensure that the GTT TLB are also flushed.

On snb-gt2, this would cause a random GPU hang at the start of a new
context (e.g. boot) and on snb-gt1, it was causing the renderstate batch
to take ~10s. It was the GPU hang that revealed the truth, as the CS
gleefully executed beyond the end of the golden renderstate batch, a good
indicator for a GTT TLB miss.
