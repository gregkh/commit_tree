iommu/io-pgtable: Sanitise map/unmap addresses

It may be an egregious error to attempt to use addresses outside the
range of the pagetable format, but that still doesn't mean we should
merrily wreak havoc by silently mapping/unmapping whatever truncated
portions of them might happen to correspond to real addresses.

Add some up-front checks to sanitise our inputs so that buggy callers
don't invite potential memory corruption.
