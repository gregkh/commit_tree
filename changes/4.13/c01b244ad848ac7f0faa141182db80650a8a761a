USB: add usbfs ioctl to retrieve the connection speed

The usbfs interface does not provide any way for the user to learn the
speed at which a device is connected.  The current API includes a
USBDEVFS_CONNECTINFO ioctl, but all it provides is the device's
address and a one-bit value indicating whether the connection is low
speed.  That may have sufficed in the era of USB-1.1, but it isn't
good enough today.

This patch introduces a new ioctl, USBDEVFS_GET_SPEED, which returns a
numeric value indicating the speed of the connection: unknown, low,
full, high, wireless, super, or super-plus.

Similar information (not exactly the same) is available through sysfs,
but it seems reasonable to provide the actual value in usbfs.
