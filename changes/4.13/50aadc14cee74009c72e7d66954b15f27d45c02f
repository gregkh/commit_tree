ASoC: sun8i-codec-analog: prepare a mixer control/widget/route set for V3s

Allwinner V3s has an analog codec without MIC2 and Line In, which will
need a special set of mixer controls/widgets/routes, otherwise meaningless
controls will be exported to userspace and confuse the user.

Add the special set, and use it when the SoC has no MIC2 and Line In.
