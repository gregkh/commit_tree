locking/qspinlock: Explicitly include asm/prefetch.h

In architectures that use qspinlock, like x86, prefetch is loaded
indirectly via the asm/qspinlock.h include.  On other architectures, like
OpenRISC, which may want to use asm-generic/qspinlock.h the built will
fail without the asm/prefetch.h include.

Fix this by including directly.
