scsi: lpfc: Fix crash after firmware flash when IO is running.

OS crashes after the completion of firmware download.

Failure in posting SCSI SGL buffers because number of SGL buffers is
less than total count. Some of the pending IOs are not completed by
driver. SGL buffers for these IOs are not added back to the list.
Pending IOs are not completed because lpfc_wq_list list is initialized
before completion of pending IOs.

Postpone lpfc_wq_list reinitialization by moving
lpfc_sli4_queue_destroy() after lpfc_hba_down_post().
