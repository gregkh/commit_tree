scsi: cxlflash: Add scsi command abort handler

To date, CXL flash devices do not support a single command abort operation.
Instead, the SISLite specification provides a context reset operation to
cleanup all pending commands for a given context.

When a context reset is successful, it is guaranteed that the AFU has
aborted all currently pending I/O. This sequence is less invasive than a
device or host reset and can be executed to support scsi command abort
requests. Add eh_abort_handler callback support to process command timeouts
and abort requests.
