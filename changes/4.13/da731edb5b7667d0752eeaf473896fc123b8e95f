[media] lirc_zilog: Fix unbalanced braces around if/else

Fix all checkpatch reported issues for:

 * CHECK: "braces {} should be used on all arms of this statement".
 * CHECK: "Unbalanced braces around else statement".

Make sure all if/else statements are balanced in terms of braces. Most
cases in code are, but a few were left unbalanced, so put them all
consistent with the recommended style.
