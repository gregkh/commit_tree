uas: Add US_FL_IGNORE_RESIDUE for Initio Corporation INIC-3069

Similar to commit d595259fbb7a ("usb-storage: Add ignore-residue quirk for
Initio INIC-3619") for INIC-3169 in unusual_devs.h but INIC-3069 already
present in unusual_uas.h. Both in same controller IC family.

Issue is that MakeMKV fails during key exchange with installed bluray drive
with following error:

002004:0000 Error 'Scsi error - ILLEGAL REQUEST:COPY PROTECTION KEY EXCHANGE FAILURE - KEY NOT ESTABLISHED'
occurred while issuing SCSI command AD010..080002400 to device 'SG:dev_11:0'
