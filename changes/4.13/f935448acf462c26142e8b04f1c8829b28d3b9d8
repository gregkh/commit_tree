iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Add workaround for Cavium ThunderX2 erratum #126

Cavium ThunderX2 SMMU doesn't support MSI and also doesn't have unique irq
lines for gerror, eventq and cmdq-sync.

New named irq "combined" is set as a errata workaround, which allows to
share the irq line by register single irq handler for all the interrupts.
