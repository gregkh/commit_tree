x86/hyperv: Check frequency MSRs presence according to the specification

Hyper-V TLFS specifies two bits which should be checked before accessing
frequency MSRs:

- AccessFrequencyMsrs (BIT(11) in EAX) which indicates if we have access to
  frequency MSRs.
- FrequencyMsrsAvailable (BIT(8) in EDX) which indicates is these MSRs are
  present.
  
Rename and specify these bits accordingly.
