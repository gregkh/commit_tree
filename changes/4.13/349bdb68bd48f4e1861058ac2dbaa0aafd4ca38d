drm/i915/execlists: Reduce lock contention between schedule/submit_request

If we do not require to perform priority bumping, and we haven't yet
submitted the request, we can update its priority in situ and skip
acquiring the engine locks -- thus avoiding any contention between us
and submit/execute.

v2: Remove the stack element from the list if we can do the early
assignment.
