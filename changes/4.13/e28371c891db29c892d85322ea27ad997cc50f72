rcu: Remove obsolete reference to synchronize_kernel()

The synchronize_kernel() primitive was removed in favor of
synchronize_sched() more than a decade ago, and it seems likely that
rather few kernel hackers are familiar with it.  Its continued presence
is therefore providing more confusion than enlightenment.  This commit
therefore removes the reference from the synchronize_sched() header
comment, and adds the corresponding information to the synchronize_rcu(0
header comment.
