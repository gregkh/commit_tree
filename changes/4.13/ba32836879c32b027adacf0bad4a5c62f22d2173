drm/nouveau/disp/gt215: Use supplied HDMI InfoFrames

Now that we have the InfoFrame data being provided, for the most
part, program the hardware to use it.

While we're here, and since the functionality will come in handy
for supporting 3D stereoscopy, implement setting the Vendor
("generic") InfoFrame.

Also don't enable any AVI or Vendor InfoFrame that is not provided,
and disable the Vendor InfoFrame when disabling the output.

Ignore the Audio InfoFrame: We don't supply it, and altering HDMI
audio semantics (for better or worse) on this hardware is out of
scope for me at this time.
