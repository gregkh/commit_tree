net: bridge: Add support for notifying devices about FDB add/del

Currently the bridge doesn't notify the underlying devices about new
FDBs learned. The FDB sync is placed on the switchdev notifier chain
because devices may potentially learn FDB that are not directly related
to their ports, for example:

1. Mixed SW/HW bridge - FDBs that point to the ASICs external devices
                        should be offloaded as CPU traps in order to
			perform forwarding in slow path.
2. EVPN - Externally learned FDBs for the vtep device.

Notification is sent only about static FDB add/del. This is done due
to fact that currently this is the only scenario supported by switch
drivers.
