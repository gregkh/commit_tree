USB: ene_usb6250: remove subroutine duplication

In the ene_usb6250 sub-driver for usb-storage, the sd_scsi_inquiry()
and ms_scsi_inquiry() subroutines (one meant for use with SD memory
cards and the other for use with MS memory cards) are exact
duplicates.  This patch removes the duplication by creating a single
do_scsi_inquiry() command and using it instead of the other two.
