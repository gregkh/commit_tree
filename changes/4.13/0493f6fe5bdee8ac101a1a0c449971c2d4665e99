mmc: block: Move boot partition locking into a driver op

This moves the boot partition lock command (issued from sysfs)
into a custom block layer request, just like the ioctl()s,
getting rid of yet another instance of mmc_get_card().

Since we now have two operations issuing special DRV_OP's, we
rename the result variable ->drv_op_result.

Tested by locking the boot partition from userspace:
> cd /sys/devices/platform/soc/80114000.sdi4_per2/mmc_host/mmc3/
     mmc3:0001/block/mmcblk3/mmcblk3boot0
> echo 1 > ro_lock_until_next_power_on
[  178.645324] mmcblk3boot1: Locking boot partition ro until next power on
[  178.652221] mmcblk3boot0: Locking boot partition ro until next power on

Also tested this with a huge dd job in the background: it
is now possible to lock the boot partitions on the card even
under heavy I/O.
