Btrfs: use bio_clone_fast to clone our bio

For raid1 and raid10, we clone the original bio to the bios which are then
sent to different disks.

Right now we use bio_clone_bioset to create a clone bio with iterating
bi_io_vec to initialize it.  This changes it to use bio_clone_fast()
which creates a clone bio but only copies the bi_io_vec pointer
instead of iterating bi_io_vec.
