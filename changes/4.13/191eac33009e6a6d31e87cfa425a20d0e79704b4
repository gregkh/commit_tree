ext4: error should be cleared if ea_inode isn't added to the cache

For Lustre, if ea_inode fails in hash validation but passes parent
inode and generation checks, it won't be added to the cache as well
as the error "-EFSCORRUPTED" should be cleared, otherwise it will
cause "Structure needs cleaning" when running getfattr command.
