tpm: move TPM 1.2 code of tpm_pcr_extend() to tpm1_pcr_extend()

In preparation of the modifications to tpm_pcr_extend(), which will
allow callers to supply a digest for each PCR bank of a TPM 2.0,
the TPM 1.2 specific code has been moved to tpm1_pcr_extend().

tpm1_pcr_extend() uses tpm_buf_init() to prepare the command buffer,
which offers protection against buffer overflow. It is called by
tpm_pcr_extend() and tpm_pm_suspend().
