KVM: SVM: handle singlestep exception when skipping emulated instructions

kvm_skip_emulated_instruction handles the singlestep debug exception
which is something we almost always want. This commit (specifically
the change in rdmsr_interception) makes the debug.flat KVM unit test
pass on AMD.

Two call sites still call skip_emulated_instruction directly:

* In svm_queue_exception where it's used only for moving the rip forward

* In task_switch_interception which is analogous to handle_task_switch
  in VMX
