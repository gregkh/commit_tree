drm/amdgpu: take ownership of per-pipe configuration v3

Make amdgpu the owner of all per-pipe state of the HQDs.

This change will allow us to split the queues between kfd and amdgpu
with a queue granularity instead of pipe granularity.

This patch fixes kfd allocating an HDP_EOP region for its 3 pipes which
goes unused.

v2: support for gfx9
v3: fix gfx7 HPD intitialization
