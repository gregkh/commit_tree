drm/sun4i: abstract a engine type

As we are going to add support for the Allwinner DE2 engine in sun4i-drm
driver, we will finally have two types of display engines -- the DE1
backend and the DE2 mixer. They both do some display blending and feed
graphics data to TCON, and is part of the "Display Engine" called by
Allwinner, so I choose to call them both "engine" here.

Abstract the engine type to a new struct with an ops struct, which contains
functions that should be called outside the engine-specified code (in
TCON, CRTC or TV Encoder code).

In order to preserve bisectability, we also switch the backend and layer
code in its own module.
