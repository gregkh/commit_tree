ARM: 8678/1: ftrace: Adds support for CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS

The DYNAMIC_FTRACE_WITH_REGS configuration makes it possible for a
ftrace operation to specify if registers need to saved/restored by
the ftrace handler. This is needed by kgraft and possibly other
ftrace-based tools, and the ARM architecture is currently lacking
this feature. It would also be the first step to support the
"Kprobes-on-ftrace" optimization on ARM.

This patch introduces a new ftrace handler that stores the registers
on the stack before calling the next stage. The registers are restored
from the stack before going back to the instrumented function.

A side-effect of this patch is to activate the support for
ftrace_modify_call() as it defines ARCH_SUPPORTS_FTRACE_OPS for the
ARM architecture.
