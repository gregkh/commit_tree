blk-mq-sched: unify request prepare methods

This patch makes sure we always allocate requests in the core blk-mq
code and use a common prepare_request method to initialize them for
both mq I/O schedulers.  For Kyber and additional limit_depth method
is added that is called before allocating the request.

Also because none of the intializations can really fail the new method
does not return an error - instead the bfq finish method is hardened
to deal with the no-IOC case.

Last but not least this removes the abuse of RQF_QUEUE by the blk-mq
scheduling code as RQF_ELFPRIV is all that is needed now.
