x86/tsc: Remodel cyc2ns to use seqcount_latch()

Replace the custom multi-value scheme with the more regular
seqcount_latch() scheme. Along with scrapping a lot of lines, the latch
scheme is better documented and used in more places.

The immediate benefit however is not being limited on the update side.
The current code has a limit where the writers block which is hit by
future changes.
