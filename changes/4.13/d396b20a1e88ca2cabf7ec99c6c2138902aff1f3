pwm: meson: Add compatible for the gxbb ao PWMs

On the gxbb (and gxl) family, the PWMs of the AO domain require a
specific compatible because the possible input clocks are different
from the EE PWMs input clocks.

Since the number of possible input clocks is also different, the
'num_parents' field is added to all the Meson PWM data.
