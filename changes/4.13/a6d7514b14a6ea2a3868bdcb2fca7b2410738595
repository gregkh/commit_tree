tty: serial: lpuart: add a more accurate baud rate calculation method

On new LPUART versions, the oversampling ratio for the receiver can be
changed from 4x (00011) to 32x (11111) which could help us get a more
accurate baud rate divider.

The idea is to use the best OSR (over-sampling rate) possible.
Note, OSR is typically hard-set to 16 in other LPUART instantiations.
Loop to find the best OSR value possible, one that generates minimum
baud diff iterate through the rest of the supported values of OSR.
