bitmap: use memcmp optimisation in more situations

Commit 7dd968163f7c ("bitmap: bitmap_equal memcmp optimization") was
rather more restrictive than necessary; we can use memcmp() to implement
bitmap_equal() as long as the number of bits can be proved to be a
multiple of 8.  And architectures other than s390 may be able to make
good use of this optimisation.
