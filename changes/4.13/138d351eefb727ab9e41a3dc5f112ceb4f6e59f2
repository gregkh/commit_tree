iscsi-target: Add login_keys_workaround attribute for non RFC initiators

This patch re-introduces part of a long standing login workaround that
was recently dropped by:

      iscsi-target: Drop work-around for legacy GlobalSAN initiator

Namely, the workaround for FirstBurstLength ended up being required by
Mellanox Flexboot PXE boot ROMs as reported by Robert.

So this patch re-adds the work-around for FirstBurstLength within
iscsi_check_proposer_for_optional_reply(), and makes the key optional
to respond when the initiator does not propose, nor respond to it.

Also as requested by Arun, this patch introduces a new TPG attribute
named 'login_keys_workaround' that controls the use of both the
FirstBurstLength workaround, as well as the two other existing
workarounds for gPXE iSCSI boot client.

By default, the workaround is enabled with login_keys_workaround=1,
since Mellanox FlexBoot requires it, and Arun has verified the Qlogic
MSFT initiator already proposes FirstBurstLength, so it's uneffected
by this re-adding this part of the original work-around.
