ixgbe: Remove MAC X550EM_X 1Gbase-t led_[on|off] support

Since FW configures the PHY and MAC X550EM_X has no
PHY access, led_[on|off] is not supported with the 1Gbase-t design.

Removed MAC X550EM_X 1Gbase-t led_[on|off] support by setting
function pointers to NULL and added NULL pointer checks. Also set
init_led_link_act to NULL and added NULL pointer check.
