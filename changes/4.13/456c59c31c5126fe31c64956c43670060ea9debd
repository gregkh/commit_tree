irqchip/gic-v2: Report failures in gic_irq_domain_alloc

If the GIC cannot map an IRQ via irq_domain_ops->alloc(), it doesn't
return an error code.  This can cause a problem with drivers, where
it thinks it has successfully got an IRQ for the device, but requesting
the same ends up failure with -ENOSYS (as the IRQ's chip is not set).

Fixes: commit 9a1091ef0017c ("irqchip: gic: Support hierarchy irq domain.")
