bio: add bvec_iter rewind API

Some ->bi_end_io handlers (for example: pi_verify or decrypt handlers)
need to know original data vector, but after bio traverse io-stack it may
be advanced, splited and relocated many times so it is hard to guess
original iterator. Let's add 'bi_done' conter which accounts number
of bytes iterator was advanced during it's evolution. Later end_io handler
may easily restore original iterator by rewinding iterator to
iter->bi_done.

Note: this change makes sizeof (struct bvec_iter) multiple to 8
