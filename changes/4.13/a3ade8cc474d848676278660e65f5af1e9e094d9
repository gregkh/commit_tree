HV: properly delay KVP packets when negotiation is in progress

The host may send multiple negotiation packets
(due to timeout) before the KVP user-mode daemon
is connected. KVP user-mode daemon is connected.
We need to defer processing those packets
until the daemon is negotiated and connected.
It's okay for guest to respond
to all negotiation packets.

In addition, the host may send multiple staged
KVP requests as soon as negotiation is done.
We need to properly process those packets using one
tasklet for exclusive access to ring buffer.
