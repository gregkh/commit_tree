Btrfs: fix blk_status_t/errno confusion

This fixes several instances of blk_status_t and bare errno ints being
mixed up, some of which are real bugs.

In the normal case, 0 matches BLK_STS_OK, so we don't observe any
effects of the missing conversion, but in case of errors or passes
through the repair/retry paths, the errors get mixed up.

The changes were identified using 'sparse', we don't have reports of the
buggy behaviour.
