scsi: cxlflash: Create character device to provide host management interface

The cxlflash driver currently lacks host management interface. Future
devices supported by cxlflash will provide a variety of host-wide
management functions. Examples include LUN provisioning, hardware debug
support, and firmware download.

In order to provide a way to manage the device, a character device will
be created during probe of each adapter. This device will support a set of
ioctls defined in the SISLite specification from which administrators can
manage the adapter.
