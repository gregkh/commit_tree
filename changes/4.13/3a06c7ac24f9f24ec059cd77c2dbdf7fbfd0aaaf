posix-clocks: Remove interval timer facility and mmap/fasync callbacks

The only user of this facility is ptp_clock, which does not implement any of
those functions.

Remove them to prevent accidental users. Especially the interval timer
interfaces are now more or less impossible to implement because the
necessary infrastructure has been confined to the core code. Aside of that
it's really complex to make these callbacks implemented according to spec
as the alarm timer implementation demonstrates. If at all then a nanosleep
callback might be a reasonable extension. For now keep just what ptp_clock
needs.
