scsi: Remove the definition of VLC_SA_RECEIVE_CREDENTIAL

The symbolic name VLC_SA_RECEIVE_CREDENTIAL is not used anywhere in the
kernel. Additionally, since SPC 5 the RECEIVE CREDENTIAL command is
obsolete. The VLC_SA_RECEIVE_CREDENTIAL definition is misleading since
it occurs outside the list of other variable length CDB service action
codes (READ_32, WRITE_32, ...). Hence remove this definition.
