ARM: dts: da850-evm: fix tca6416 for use with GPIO hogs

In order GPIOS from this controller to be used with the "gpio-hogs"
property, the tca6416 node has to properly labeled as a gpio-controller,
and use #gpio-cells.

With that, the SEL_A, SEL_B, SEL_C lines that are used to select VPIF
input can be configured using GPIO hogs.

As an example, example, the configuration below selects the analog video
input on the da850-evm UI board:

&tca6416 {
	 status = "okay";

	 sel_a {
		gpio-hog;
		gpios = <7 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		output-high;
		line-name = "ADC_ENn";
	 };
	 sel_b {
		gpio-hog;
		gpios = <6 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		output-high;
		line-name = "CAMERA_ENn";
	 };
	 sel_c {
		gpio-hog;
		gpios = <5 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		output-low;
		line-name = "VIDEO_IN_ENn";
	 };
};
