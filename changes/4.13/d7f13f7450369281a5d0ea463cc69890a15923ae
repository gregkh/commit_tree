cfg80211: Validate frequencies nested in NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES

validate_scan_freqs() retrieves frequencies from attributes
nested in the attribute NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES with
nla_get_u32(), which reads 4 bytes from each attribute
without validating the size of data received. Attributes
nested in NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQUENCIES don't have an nla policy.

Validate size of each attribute before parsing to avoid potential buffer
overread.
