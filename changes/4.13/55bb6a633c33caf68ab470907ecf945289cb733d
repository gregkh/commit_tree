clk: rockchip: mark noc and some special clk as critical on rk3288

The atclk/dbg/jtag/hsic-xin12m/pclk_core clks no driver to handle them.
But this clks need enable,so make it as ignore_unused for now.

The ddrupctl0/ddrupctl1/publ0/publ1 clks no driver to handle them,
Chip design requirements for these clock to always on,

The pmu_hclk_otg0 is Chip design defect, must be always on,
