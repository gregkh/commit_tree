mtd: nand: fsmc: add support for SDR timings

Until now, the fsmc_nand driver was either using controller timings
specified in the Device Tree (through FSMC specific DT properties) or
alternatively default/fallback timings.

This commit implements support to use the timings advertised by the NAND
chip itself, by implementing the ->setup_data_interface() hook. To
preserve backward compatibility, if timings are specified in the Device
Tree, we use the timings from the Device Tree (and don't implement
->setup_data_interface).

Many thanks to Boris Brezillon for coming up with the logic to convert
the NAND chip timings into the timings expected by the FSMC controller.

Also, since the timings are now not only coming from the DT, the message
warning that default timings will be used is removed.
