arm64: Add dump_backtrace() in show_regs

Generic code expects show_regs() to dump the stack, but arm64's
show_regs() does not. This makes it hard to debug softlockups and
other issues that result in show_regs() being called.

This patch updates arm64's show_regs() to dump the stack, as common
code expects.
