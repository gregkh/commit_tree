PM / runtime: Document new pm_runtime_set_suspended() constraint

Since commit a8636c89648a (PM / Runtime: Don't allow to suspend a
device with an active child) it is no longer permitted to set
RPM_SUSPENDED state for a device with active children unless
power.ignore_children is set.

Update the documentation to reflect this.
