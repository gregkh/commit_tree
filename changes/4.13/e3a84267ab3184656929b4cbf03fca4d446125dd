mmc: core: Prevent processing SDIO IRQs when none is claimed

In cases when MMC_CAP2_SDIO_IRQ_NOTHREAD is set, there is a minor window
for when the mmc host could call sdio_run_irqs(), while in fact an SDIO
func driver could have decided to released the SDIO IRQ via a call to
sdio_release_irq(). In this scenario, processing of the SDIO IRQs are done
even if there is none IRQ claimed, which is not what we want.

To prevent this from happen, close the window by validating that at least
one SDIO IRQs is claimed, before deciding to process them.
