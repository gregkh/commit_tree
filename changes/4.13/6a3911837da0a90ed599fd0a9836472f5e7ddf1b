selinux: enable genfscon labeling for tracefs

In kernel version 4.1, tracefs was separated from debugfs into its
own filesystem. Prior to this split, files in
/sys/kernel/debug/tracing could be labeled during filesystem
creation using genfscon or later from userspace using setxattr. This
change re-enables support for genfscon labeling.
