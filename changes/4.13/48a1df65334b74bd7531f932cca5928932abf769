skbuff: return -EMSGSIZE in skb_to_sgvec to prevent overflow

This is a defense-in-depth measure in response to bugs like
4d6fa57b4dab ("macsec: avoid heap overflow in skb_to_sgvec"). There's
not only a potential overflow of sglist items, but also a stack overflow
potential, so we fix this by limiting the amount of recursion this function
is allowed to do. Not actually providing a bounded base case is a future
disaster that we can easily avoid here.

As a small matter of house keeping, we take this opportunity to move the
documentation comment over the actual function the documentation is for.

While this could be implemented by using an explicit stack of skbuffs,
when implementing this, the function complexity increased considerably,
and I don't think such complexity and bloat is actually worth it. So,
instead I built this and tested it on x86, x86_64, ARM, ARM64, and MIPS,
and measured the stack usage there. I also reverted the recent MIPS
changes that give it a separate IRQ stack, so that I could experience
some worst-case situations. I found that limiting it to 24 layers deep
yielded a good stack usage with room for safety, as well as being much
deeper than any driver actually ever creates.
