crc32.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Add a title for the document;
- Mark literal blocks.

While here, replace a comma by a dot at the end of a paragraph.
