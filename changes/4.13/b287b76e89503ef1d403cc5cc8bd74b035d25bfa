Revert "IB/core: Allow QP state transition from reset to error"

The commit ebc9ca43e1d5 ("IB/core: Allow QP state transition from reset to error")
allowed transition from Reset to Error state for the QPs. This behavior
doesn't follow the IBTA specification 1.3, which in 10.3.1 QUEUE PAIR AND
EE CONTEXT STATES section.

The quote from the spec:
"An error can be forced from any state, except Reset, with
the Modify QP/EE Verb."
