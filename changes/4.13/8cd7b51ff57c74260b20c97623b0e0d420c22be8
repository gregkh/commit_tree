arm64: renesas: salvator-common: avoid audio_clkout naming conflict

clock name of "audio_clkout" is used by Renesas sound driver.
This duplicated naming breaks its clock registering/unregistering.
Especially, when unbind/bind it can't handle clkout correctly.
This patch renames "audio_clkout" to "audio-clkout" to avoid
naming conflict.
