mm: revert x86_64 and arm64 ELF_ET_DYN_BASE base changes

Moving the x86_64 and arm64 PIE base from 0x555555554000 to 0x000100000000
broke AddressSanitizer.  This is a partial revert of:

  eab09532d400 ("binfmt_elf: use ELF_ET_DYN_BASE only for PIE")
  02445990a96e ("arm64: move ELF_ET_DYN_BASE to 4GB / 4MB")

The AddressSanitizer tool has hard-coded expectations about where
executable mappings are loaded.

The motivation for changing the PIE base in the above commits was to
avoid the Stack-Clash CVEs that allowed executable mappings to get too
close to heap and stack.  This was mainly a problem on 32-bit, but the
64-bit bases were moved too, in an effort to proactively protect those
systems (proofs of concept do exist that show 64-bit collisions, but
other recent changes to fix stack accounting and setuid behaviors will
minimize the impact).

The new 32-bit PIE base is fine for ASan (since it matches the ET_EXEC
base), so only the 64-bit PIE base needs to be reverted to let x86 and
arm64 ASan binaries run again.  Future changes to the 64-bit PIE base on
these architectures can be made optional once a more dynamic method for
dealing with AddressSanitizer is found.  (e.g.  always loading PIE into
the mmap region for marked binaries.)
