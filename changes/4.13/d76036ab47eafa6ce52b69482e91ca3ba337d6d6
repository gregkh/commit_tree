audit: Fix use after free in audit_remove_watch_rule()

audit_remove_watch_rule() drops watch's reference to parent but then
continues to work with it. That is not safe as parent can get freed once
we drop our reference. The following is a trivial reproducer:

mount -o loop image /mnt
touch /mnt/file
auditctl -w /mnt/file -p wax
umount /mnt
auditctl -D
<crash in fsnotify_destroy_mark()>

Grab our own reference in audit_remove_watch_rule() earlier to make sure
mark does not get freed under us.
