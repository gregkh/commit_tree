EDAC, sb_edac: Classify PCI-IDs by topology

Each of the PCI device IDs belongs to a CPU socket, or to one of the
integrated memory controllers. Provide an enum to specify the domain of
each, and distinguish the resource number in each domain: the number
of the PCI device IDs per integrated memory controller/socket, and the
number of integrated memory controllers per socket.
