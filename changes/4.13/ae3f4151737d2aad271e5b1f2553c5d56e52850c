kbuild: replace genhdr-y with generated-y

Originally, generated-y and genhdr-y had different meaning, like
follows:

- generated-y: generated headers (other than asm-generic wrappers)
- header-y   : headers to be exported
- genhdr-y   : generated headers to be exported (generated-y + header-y)

Since commit fcc8487d477a ("uapi: export all headers under uapi
directories"), headers under UAPI directories are all exported.
So, there is no more difference between generated-y and genhdr-y.

We see two users of genhdr-y, arch/{arm,x86}/include/uapi/asm/Kbuild.
They generate some headers in arch/{arm,x86}/include/generated/uapi/asm
directories, which are obviously exported.

Replace them with generated-y, and abolish genhdr-y.
