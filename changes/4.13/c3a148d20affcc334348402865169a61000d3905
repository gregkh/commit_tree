blk-mq: Initialize .rq_flags in blk_mq_rq_ctx_init()

Initialization of blk-mq requests is a bit weird: blk_mq_rq_ctx_init()
is called after a value has been assigned to .rq_flags and .rq_flags
is initialized in __blk_mq_finish_request(). Initialize .rq_flags in
blk_mq_rq_ctx_init() instead of relying on __blk_mq_finish_request().
Moving the initialization of .rq_flags is fine because all changes
and tests of .rq_flags occur between blk_get_request() and finishing
a request.
