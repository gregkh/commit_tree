amd-xgbe: Simplify the burst length settings

Currently the driver hardcodes the PBLx8 setting.  Remove the need for
specifying the PBLx8 setting and automatically calculate based on the
specified PBL value. Since the PBLx8 setting applies to both Tx and Rx
use the same PBL value for both of them.

Also, the driver currently uses a bit field to set the AXI master burst
len setting. Change to the full bit field range and set the burst length
based on the specified value.
