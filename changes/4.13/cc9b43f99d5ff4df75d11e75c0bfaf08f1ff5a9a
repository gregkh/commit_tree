KVM: arm/arm64: use vcpu requests for power_off

System shutdown is currently using request-less VCPU kicks. This
leaves open a tiny race window, as it doesn't ensure the state
change to power_off is seen by a VCPU just about to enter guest
mode. VCPU requests, OTOH, are guaranteed to be seen (see "Ensuring
Requests Are Seen" of Documentation/virtual/kvm/vcpu-requests.rst)
This patch applies the EXIT request used by pause to power_off,
fixing the race.
