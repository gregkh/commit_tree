xhci: Bad Ethernet performance plugged in ASM1042A host

When USB Ethernet is plugged in ASMEDIA ASM1042A xHCI host, bad
performance was manifesting in Web browser use (like download
large file such as ISO image). It is known limitation of
ASM1042A that is not compatible with driver scheduling,
As a workaround we can modify flow control handling of ASM1042A.
The register we modify is changes the behavior
