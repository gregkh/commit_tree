watchdog: gpio: Convert to use infrastructure triggered keepalives

The watchdog infrastructure now supports handling watchdog keepalive
if the watchdog is running while the watchdog device is closed.
The infrastructure now also supports generating additional heartbeats
if the maximum hardware timeout is smaller than or close to the
configured timeout. Convert the driver to use this infrastructure.
