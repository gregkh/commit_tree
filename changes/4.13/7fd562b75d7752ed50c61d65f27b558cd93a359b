EDAC, sb_edac: Don't use "Socket#" in the memory controller name

EDAC assigns logical memory controller numbers in the order that we find
memory controllers, which depends on which PCI bus they are on. Some
systems end up with MC0 on socket0, others (e.g Haswell) have MC0 on
socket3.

All this is made more confusing for users because we use the string
"Socket" while generating names for memory controllers, but the number
that we attach there is the memory controller number. E.g.

  EDAC MC0: Giving out device to module sbridge_edac.c controller
    Haswell Socket#0: DEV 0000:ff:12.0 (INTERRUPT)

Change the names to say "SrcID#%d" (where the number we use is read from
the h/w associated with the memory controller instead of some logical
number internal to the EDAC driver). New message:

  EDAC MC0: Giving out device to module sbridge_edac.c controller
    Haswell SrcID#3: DEV 0000:ff:12.0 (INTERRUPT)
