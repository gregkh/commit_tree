ALSA: pcm: add tracepoints for final selection process of hardware parameters

Results of ioctl(2) with SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_HW_REFINE and
SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_HW_PARAMS are different, because the latter has single
value for several parameters; e.g. channels of PCM substream. Selection
of the single value is done independently of application of constraints.
It's helpful for developers to trace the selection process.

This commit adds tracepoints to snd_pcm_hw_params_choose() for the
purpose.
