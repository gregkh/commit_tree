ovl: cleanup orphan index entries

index entry should live only as long as there are upper or lower
hardlinks.

Cleanup orphan index entries on mount and when dropping the last
overlay inode nlink.

When about to cleanup or link up to orphan index and the index inode
nlink > 1, admit that something went wrong and adjust overlay nlink
to index inode nlink - 1 to prevent it from dropping below zero.
This could happen when adding lower hardlinks underneath a mounted
overlay and then trying to unlink them.
