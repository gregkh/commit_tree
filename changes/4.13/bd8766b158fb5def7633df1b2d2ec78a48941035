serial: pl010: Move uart_register_driver call to device probe

uart_register_driver call binds the driver to a specific device
node through tty_register_driver call. This should typically
happen during device probe call.

In a multiplatform scenario, it is possible that multiple serial
drivers are part of the kernel. Currently the driver registration fails
if multiple serial drivers with overlapping major/minor numbers are
included.
