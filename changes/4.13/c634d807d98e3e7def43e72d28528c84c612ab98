mm/kasan: get rid of speculative shadow checks

For some unaligned memory accesses we have to check additional byte of
the shadow memory.  Currently we load that byte speculatively to have
only single load + branch on the optimistic fast path.

However, this approach has some downsides:

 - It's unaligned access, so this prevents porting KASAN on
   architectures which doesn't support unaligned accesses.

 - We have to map additional shadow page to prevent crash if speculative
   load happens near the end of the mapped memory. This would
   significantly complicate upcoming memory hotplug support.

I wasn't able to notice any performance degradation with this patch.  So
these speculative loads is just a pain with no gain, let's remove them.
