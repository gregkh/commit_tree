samples/bpf: add tests for more perf event types

$ trace_event

tests attaching BPF program to HW_CPU_CYCLES, SW_CPU_CLOCK, HW_CACHE_L1D and other events.
It runs 'dd' in the background while bpf program collects user and kernel
stack trace on counter overflow.
User space expects to see sys_read and sys_write in the kernel stack.

$ tracex6

tests reading of various perf counters from BPF program.

Both tests were refactored to increase coverage and be more accurate.
