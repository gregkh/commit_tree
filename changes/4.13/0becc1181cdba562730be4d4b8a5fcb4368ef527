sunrpc: move pc_count out of struct svc_procinfo

pc_count is the only writeable memeber of struct svc_procinfo, which is
a good candidate to be const-ified as it contains function pointers.

This patch moves it into out out struct svc_procinfo, and into a
separate writable array that is pointed to by struct svc_version.
