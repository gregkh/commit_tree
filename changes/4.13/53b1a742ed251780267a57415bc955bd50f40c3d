arm64: ptrace: Avoid setting compat FP[SC]R to garbage if get_user fails

If get_user() fails when reading the new FPSCR value from userspace
in compat_vfp_get(), then garbage* will be written to the task's
FPSR and FPCR registers.

This patch prevents this by checking the return from get_user()
first.

[*] Actually, zero, due to the behaviour of get_user() on error, but
that's still not what userspace expects.
