s390/dumpstack: remove raw stack dump

Remove raw stack dumps that are printed before call traces in case of
a warning, or the 'l' sysrq trigger (show a stack backtrace for all
active CPUs).

Besides that a raw stack dump should not be shown for the 'l' sysrq
trigger the value of the dump is close to zero. That's also why we
don't print it in case of a panic since ages anymore. That this is
still printed on warnings is just a leftover. So get rid of this
completely.

The following won't be printed anymore with this change:

Stack:
