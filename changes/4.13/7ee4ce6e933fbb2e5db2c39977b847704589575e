usb: typec: update partner power delivery support with opmode

If USB PD contract is established after creation of the
partner, the power delivery support attribute of the partner
needs to be updated separately. This can be done in
typec_set_pwr_opmode() by checking if the port has already
partner and updating the value if it does.
