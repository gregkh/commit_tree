bpf: fix two missing target_size settings in bpf_convert_ctx_access

When CONFIG_NET_SCHED or CONFIG_NET_RX_BUSY_POLL is /not/ set and
we try a narrow __sk_buff load of tc_index or napi_id, respectively,
then verifier rightfully complains that it's misconfigured, because
we need to set target_size in each of the two cases. The rewrite
for the ctx access is just a dummy op, but needs to pass, so fix
this up.
