ALSA: pcm: use goto statement instead of while statement to reduce indentation

In a process to calculate parameters of PCM substream, application of all
rules is iterated several times till parameter dependencies are satisfied.
In current implementation, two loops are used for the design, however this
brings two-level indentation and decline readability.

This commit attempts to reduce the indentation by using goto statement,
instead of outer while loop.
