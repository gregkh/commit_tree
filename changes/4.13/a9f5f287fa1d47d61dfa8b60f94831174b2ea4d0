ath10k: add BMI parameters to fix calibration from DT/pre-cal

QCA99X0, QCA9888, QCA9984 supports calibration data in
either OTP or DT/pre-cal file. Current ath10k supports
Calibration data from OTP only.

If caldata is loaded from DT/pre-cal file, fetching board id
and applying calibration parameters like tx power gets failed.

error log:
[   15.733663] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to fetch board file: -2
[   15.741474] ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: could not probe fw (-2)

This patch adds calibration data support from DT/pre-cal
file.  Below parameters are used to get board id and
applying calibration parameters from cal data.

		EEPROM[OTP]	FLASH[DT/pre-cal file]
Cal param	0x700		0x10000
Board id	0x10		0x8000

Tested on QCA9888 with pre-cal file.
