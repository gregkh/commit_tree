drm/i915/cfl: Introduce Coffee Lake workarounds.

Coffee Lake inherit most of Kabylake production
workarounds.

v2: Fix typo on commit message and remove
    WaDisableKillLogic and GEN9_DISABLE_OCL_OOB_SUPPRESS_LOGIC,
    since as Mika pointed out they shouldn't be here for cfl
    according to BSpec.
