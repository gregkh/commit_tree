ALSA: pcm: enable parameter tracepoints only when CONFIG_SND_DEBUG is enabled

In a previous commit, tracepoints are added for PCM parameter processing.
As long as I know, this implementation increases size of relocatable
object by 35%. For vendors who are conscious of memory footprint, it
brings apparent disadvantage.

This commit utilizes CONFIG_SND_DEBUG configuration to enable/disable the
tracepoints.
