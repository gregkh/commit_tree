s390/dasd: fix hanging safe offline

The safe offline processing may hang forever because it waits for I/O
which can not be started because of the offline flag that prevents new
I/O from being started.

Allow I/O to be started during safe offline processing because in this
special case we take care that the queues are empty before throwing away
the device.
