tools/testing/nvdimm: fix nfit_test buffer overflow

The root cause of panic is the num_pm of nfit_test1 is wrong.
Though 1 is specified for num_pm at nfit_test_init(), it must be 2,
because nfit_test1->spa_set[] array has 2 elements.

Since the array is smaller than expected, the driver breaks other area.
(it is often the link list of devres).

As a result, panic occurs like the following example.

    CPU: 4 PID: 2233 Comm: lt-libndctl Tainted: G           O    4.12.0-rc1+ #12
