ubifs: Fix data node size for truncating uncompressed nodes

Currently, the function truncate_data_node only updates the
destination data node size if compression is used. For
uncompressed nodes, the old length is incorrectly retained.

This patch makes sure that the length is correctly set when
compression is disabled.
