bio-integrity: fold bio_integrity_enabled to bio_integrity_prep

Currently all integrity prep hooks are open-coded, and if prepare fails
we ignore it's code and fail bio with EIO. Let's return real error to
upper layer, so later caller may react accordingly.

In fact no one want to use bio_integrity_prep() w/o bio_integrity_enabled,
so it is reasonable to fold it in to one function.
