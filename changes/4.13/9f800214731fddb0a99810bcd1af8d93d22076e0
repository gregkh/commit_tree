drm/doc: Clarify mode_fixup vs. atomic_check a bit more

Brought up by both Laurent and Andrzej when reviewing the new
->mode_valid hooks. Since mode_fixup is just a simpler version of the
much more generic atomic_check we can't really unify it with
mode_valid. Most drivers should probably switch their current
mode_fixup code to either the new mode_valid or the atomic_check
hooks, but e.g. that doesn't exist yet for bridges, and for CRTCs the
situation is a bit more complicated. Hence there's no clear
equivalence between mode_fixup and mode_valid, even if it looks like
that at first glance.

v2: Fix accidental double-dot (Adnrzej).
