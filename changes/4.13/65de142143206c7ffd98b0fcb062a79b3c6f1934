arm64: fix endianness annotation in aarch64_insn_read()

The function arch64_insn_read() is used to read an instruction.
On AM64 instructions are always stored in little-endian order
and thus the function correctly do a little-to-native endian
conversion to the value just read.

However, the variable used to hold the value before the conversion
is not declared for a little-endian value but for a native one.

Fix this by using the correct type for the declaration: __le32

Note: This only works because the function reading the value,
      probe_kernel_read((), takes a void pointer and void pointers
      are endian-agnostic. Otherwise probe_kernel_read() should
      also be properly annotated (or worse, need to be specialized).
