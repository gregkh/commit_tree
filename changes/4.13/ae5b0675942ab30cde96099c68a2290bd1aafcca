Revert "MIPS: Don't unnecessarily include kmalloc.h into <asm/cache.h>."

Commit 296e46db0073 ("MIPS: Don't unnecessarily include kmalloc.h into
<asm/cache.h>.") claimed that the inclusion of the machine's kmalloc.h
from asm/cache.h is unnecessary, but this is not true.

Without including kmalloc.h we don't get a definition for
ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN, which means we no longer suitably align DMA. Further
to this the definition of ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN provided by linux/slab.h
ends up being set to the alignment of an unsigned long long value rather
than to ARCH_DMA_MINALIGN, which means that buffers allocated using
kmalloc may no longer be safely aligned for use with DMA.

Fix this by re-adding the include of kmalloc.h in asm/cache.h. This
reverts commit 296e46db0073 ("MIPS: Don't unnecessarily include
kmalloc.h into <asm/cache.h>.")
