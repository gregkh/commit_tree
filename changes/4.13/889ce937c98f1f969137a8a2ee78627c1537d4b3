vxlan: correctly set vxlan->net when creating the device in a netns

Commit a985343ba906 ("vxlan: refactor verification and application of
configuration") modified vxlan device creation, and replaced the
assignment of vxlan->net to src_net with dev_net(netdev) in ->setup().

But dev_net(netdev) is not the same as src_net. At the time ->setup()
is called, dev_net hasn't been set yet, so we end up creating the
socket for the vxlan device in init_net.

Fix this by bringing back the assignment of vxlan->net during device
creation.
