drm/i915: Combine write_domain flushes to a single function

In the next patch, we will introduce a new cache domain for
differentiating between GTT access and direct WC access. This will
require us to include WC in our write_domain flushes. Rather than
duplicate a third function, combine the existing two into one and
flushing WC writes will then be automatically handled as well.

v2: Be smarter and clearer by passing in the write domains to flush (Joonas)
v3: One missed ~ in v2 conversion
