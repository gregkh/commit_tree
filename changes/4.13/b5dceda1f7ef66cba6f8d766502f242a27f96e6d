lib/raid6: Add log-of-2 table for RAID6 HW requiring disk position

The raid6_gfexp table represents {2}^n values for 0 <= n < 256. The
Linux async_tx framework pass values from raid6_gfexp as coefficients
for each source to prep_dma_pq() callback of DMA channel with PQ
capability. This creates problem for RAID6 offload engines (such as
Broadcom SBA) which take disk position (i.e. log of {2}) instead of
multiplicative cofficients from raid6_gfexp table.

This patch adds raid6_gflog table having log-of-2 value for any given
x such that 0 <= x < 256. For any given disk coefficient x, the
corresponding disk position is given by raid6_gflog[x]. The RAID6
offload engine driver can use this newly added raid6_gflog table to
get disk position from multiplicative coefficient.
