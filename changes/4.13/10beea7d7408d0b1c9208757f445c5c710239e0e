rds: tcp: Set linger when rejecting an incoming conn in rds_tcp_accept_one

Each time we get an incoming SYN to the RDS_TCP_PORT, the TCP
layer accepts the connection and then the rds_tcp_accept_one()
callback is invoked to process the incoming connection.

rds_tcp_accept_one() may reject the incoming syn for a number of
reasons, e.g., commit 1a0e100fb2c9 ("RDS: TCP: Force every connection
to be initiated by numerically smaller IP address"), or because
we are getting spammed by a malicious node that is triggering
a flood of connection attempts to RDS_TCP_PORT. If the incoming
syn is rejected, no data would have been sent on the TCP socket,
and we do not need to be in TIME_WAIT state, so we set linger on
the TCP socket before closing, thereby closing the socket efficiently
with a RST.
