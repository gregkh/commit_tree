ASoC: rt5645: Add jack detection workaround for GPD Win

GPD Win requires jd_mode=3 and the inverted flag for making the jack
detection working.  Unfortunately, the BIOS doesn't give a nice way to
match with DMI strings, and the only working way so far is to match
with the board vendor/name/version/date to some known patterns.

Hopefully other vendors won't do such a stupid setup, too...

Thanks to Hans de Goede for the DMI matching suggestion.
