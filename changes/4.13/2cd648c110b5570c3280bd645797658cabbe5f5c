include/linux/sem.h: correctly document sem_ctime

sem_ctime is initialized to the semget() time and then updated at every
semctl() that changes the array.

Thus it does not represent the time of the last change.

Especially, semop() calls are only stored in sem_otime, not in
sem_ctime.

This is already described in ipc/sem.c, I just overlooked that there is
a comment in include/linux/sem.h and man semctl(2) as well.

So: Correct wrong comments.
