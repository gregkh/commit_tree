net: phy: Create sysfs reciprocal links for attached_dev/phydev

There is currently no way for a program scanning /sys to know whether a
network device is attached to a particular PHY device, just like the PHY
device is not pointed back to its attached network device.

Create a symbolic link in the network device's namespace named "phydev"
which points to the PHY device and create a symbolic link in the PHY
device's namespace named "attached_dev" that points back to the network
device. These links are set up during phy_attach_direct() and removed
during phy_detach() for symetry.
