mailbox.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Add markups for section titles;
- Use :Author: for authorship;
- Mark literal block as such and ident it.
