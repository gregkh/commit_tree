scsi: bnx2fc: If IO is still in cleanup then do not return to SCSI layer.

In eh_abort, driver is calling scsi->done() for a IO for which cleanup is
pending. As the IO is outstanding with the firmware, it may do DMA
associated with the IO. This may lead to heap corruption.

Do not complete the IO for which cleanup is still pending. Return failure
from eh_abort and let the SCSI-ml retry the IO.
