xen: fix hvm guest with kaslr enabled

A Xen HVM guest running with KASLR enabled will die rather soon today
because the shared info page mapping is using va() too early. This was
introduced by commit a5d5f328b0e2baa5ee7c119fd66324eb79eeeb66 ("xen:
allocate page for shared info page from low memory").

In order to fix this use early_memremap() to get a temporary virtual
address for shared info until va() can be used safely.
