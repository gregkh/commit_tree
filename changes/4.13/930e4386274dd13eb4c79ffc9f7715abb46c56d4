ARM: s3c2410_defconfig: Bring back lost (but wanted) options

The config was not updated for some time so it needs updates to get the
same options as wanted initially:
 - IP_NF_TARGET_LOG was replaced by NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_LOG;
 - NF_NAT was replaced by IP_NF_NAT;
 - SERIAL_DEV_BUS is now needed for BT_HCIUART_LL;
 - TPS65010 is now needed for MACH_OSIRIS_DVS;
 - DMADEVICES and S3C24XX_DMAC are now needed for MMC_S3C;
