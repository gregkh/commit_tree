ARM: dts: imx6-sabresd: add OV5642 and OV5640 camera sensors

Enables the OV5642 parallel-bus sensor, and the OV5640 MIPI CSI-2 sensor.

The OV5642 connects to the parallel-bus mux input port on ipu1_csi0_mux.

The OV5640 connects to the input port on the MIPI CSI-2 receiver on
mipi_csi.

Until the OV5652 sensor module compatible with the SabreSD becomes
available for testing, the ov5642 node is currently disabled.
