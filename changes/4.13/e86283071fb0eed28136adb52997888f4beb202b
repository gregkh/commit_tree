bpf: expose prog id for cls_bpf and act_bpf

In order to be able to retrieve the attached programs from cls_bpf
and act_bpf, we need to expose the prog ids via netlink so that
an application can later on get an fd based on the id through the
BPF_PROG_GET_FD_BY_ID command, and dump related prog info via
BPF_OBJ_GET_INFO_BY_FD command for bpf(2).
