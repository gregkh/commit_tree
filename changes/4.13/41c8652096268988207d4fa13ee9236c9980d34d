ARM: dts: mvebu: add support for Linksys WRT3200ACM (Rango)

The Linksys WRT3200ACM (Rango) is the lates Armada-385 based router in
the Linksys WRT AC Series which got released in October 2016.

Key differences to the earlier Armada-385 based devices in the series is
a bigger flash chip, next generation wireless modules (Marvell 88W8964)
in the mini pcie slots as well as a Marvell SD8887. Finally the CPU is
clocked at 1866 GHz by default.

The file armada-385-linksys-rango.dts is loosly based off of a DTS
authored by Imre Kaloz.

As Rango is part of the armada-385-linksys family of boards use the
armada-385-linksys.dtsi as basis. As for functional differences to Imre
Kaloz dts, the wlan LEDs aren't connected to the expander chip pca9635
but directly to GPIOs. Then mpp47 controls the USB2.0 port and not the
USB3.0 port, so use the correct GPIO mpp44 for it. Finally use
non-removable instead of broken-cd with the sdhci node to avoid polling.

Other changes can be categorized as just cleanup / reorganization due to
using the armada-385-linksys.dtsi.
