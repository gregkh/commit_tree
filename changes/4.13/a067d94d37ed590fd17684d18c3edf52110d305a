arm64: kaslr: Adjust the offset to avoid Image across alignment boundary

With 16KB pages and a kernel Image larger than 16MB, the current
kaslr_early_init() logic for avoiding mappings across swapper table
boundaries fails since increasing the offset by kimg_sz just moves the
problem to the next boundary.

This patch rounds the offset down to (1 << SWAPPER_TABLE_SHIFT) if the
Image crosses a PMD_SIZE boundary.
