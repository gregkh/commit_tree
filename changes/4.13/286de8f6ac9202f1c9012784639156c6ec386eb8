KVM: trigger uevents when creating or destroying a VM

This patch adds a few lines to the KVM common code to fire a
KOBJ_CHANGE uevent whenever a KVM VM is created or destroyed. The event
carries five environment variables:

CREATED indicates how many times a new VM has been created. It is
	useful for example to trigger specific actions when the first
	VM is started
COUNT indicates how many VMs are currently active. This can be used for
	logging or monitoring purposes
PID has the pid of the KVM process that has been started or stopped.
	This can be used to perform process-specific tuning.
STATS_PATH contains the path in debugfs to the directory with all the
	runtime statistics for this VM. This is useful for performance
	monitoring and profiling.
EVENT described the type of event, its value can be either "create" or
	"destroy"

Specific udev rules can be then set up in userspace to deal with the
creation or destruction of VMs as needed.
