PCI: Add pci_assign_irq() function and have pci_fixup_irqs() use it

Here we delete the static pdev_fixup_irq() function which is currently what
pci_fixup_irqs() uses to actually assign the IRQs and replace it with the
pci_assign_irq() function which changes the interface and uses the new
function pointers stored in the host bridge structure.

Eventually this will allow pci_fixup_irqs() to be removed entirely and the
new deferred assignment code path will call pci_assign_irq() directly.
However to ensure current users continue to work, a new implementation of
pci_fixup_irqs() is introduced which simply wraps the functionality of
pci_assign_irq().
