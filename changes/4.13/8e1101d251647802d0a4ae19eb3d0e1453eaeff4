PCI/MSI: Don't warn when irq_create_affinity_masks() returns NULL

irq_create_affinity_masks() can return NULL on non-SMP systems, when there
are not enough "free" vectors available to spread, or if memory allocation
for the CPU masks fails.  Only the allocation failure is of interest, and
even then the system will work just fine except for non-optimally spread
vectors.  Thus remove the warnings.
