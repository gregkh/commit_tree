[media] cec: add CEC_CAP_NEEDS_HPD

Add a new capability CEC_CAP_NEEDS_HPD. If this capability is set
then the hardware can only use CEC if the HDMI Hotplug Detect pin
is high. Such hardware cannot handle the corner case in the CEC specification
where it is possible to transmit messages even if no hotplug signal is
present (needed for some displays that turn off the HPD when in standby,
but still have CEC enabled).

Typically hardware that needs this capability have the HPD wired to the CEC
block, often to a 'power' or 'active' pin.
