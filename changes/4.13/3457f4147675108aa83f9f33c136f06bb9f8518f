mm/zsmalloc.c: fix -Wunneeded-internal-declaration warning

is_first_page() is only called from the macro VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() which is
only compiled in as a runtime check when CONFIG_DEBUG_VM is set,
otherwise is checked at compile time and not actually compiled in.

Fixes the following warning, found with Clang:

  mm/zsmalloc.c:472:12: warning: function 'is_first_page' is not needed and will not be emitted [-Wunneeded-internal-declaration]
  static int is_first_page(struct page *page)
           ^
