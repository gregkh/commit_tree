iwlwifi: mvm: unconditionally stop device after init

In commit b93b1fe3b532 ("iwlwifi: mvm: fix init_dbg flow to work
as expected"), the code was changed to make the stop conditional
on not having failed (and on not having init_dbg), which doesn't
make sense - we should stop the device regardless of failures.

Failure to do so is leading to the device being enabled when it
shouldn't be, and - if it gets re-enabled later - the new context
info code gets confused as paging data wasn't freed.

Remove the invalid error condition again.
