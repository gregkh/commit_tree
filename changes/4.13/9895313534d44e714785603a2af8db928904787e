checkpatch: Remove checks for expedited grace periods

There was a time when the expedited grace-period primitives
(synchronize_rcu_expedited(), synchronize_rcu_bh_expedited(), and
synchronize_sched_expedited()) used rather antisocial kernel
facilities like try_stop_cpus().  However, they have since been
housebroken to use only single-CPU IPIs, and typically cause less
disturbance than a scheduling-clock interrupt.  Furthermore, this
disturbance can be eliminated entirely using NO_HZ_FULL on the
one hand or the rcupdate.rcu_normal boot parameter on the other.

This commit therefore removes checkpatch's complaints about use
of the expedited RCU primitives.
