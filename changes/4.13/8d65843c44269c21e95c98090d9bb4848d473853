Revert "vhost: cache used event for better performance"

This reverts commit 809ecb9bca6a9424ccd392d67e368160f8b76c92. Since it
was reported to break vhost_net. We want to cache used event and use
it to check for notification. The assumption was that guest won't move
the event idx back, but this could happen in fact when 16 bit index
wraps around after 64K entries.
