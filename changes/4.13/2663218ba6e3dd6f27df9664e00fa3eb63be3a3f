ima: Simplify policy_func_show.

If the func_tokens array uses the same indices as enum ima_hooks,
policy_func_show can be a lot simpler, and the func_* enum becomes
unnecessary.

Also, if we use the same macro trick used by kernel_read_file_id_str we can
use one hooks list for both the enum and the string array, making sure they
are always in sync (suggested by Mimi Zohar).

Finally, by using the printf pattern for the function token directly
instead of using the pt macro we can simplify policy_func_show even further
and avoid needing a temporary buffer.
