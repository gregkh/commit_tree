svga.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:
- Use standard notation for titles;
- Use the note mark;
- mark literal blocks;
- adjust identation;
- mark the table.
