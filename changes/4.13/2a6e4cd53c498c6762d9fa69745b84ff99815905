drm/exynos: mixer: document YCbCr magic numbers

The output stage of the mixer uses YCbCr for the internal
computations, which is the reason that some registers take
YCbCr related data as input. In particular this applies
to MXR_BG_COLOR{0,1,2} and MXR_CM_COEFF_{Y,CB,CR}.

Document the formatting of the data which we write to
these registers.

While at it, unify wording of comments in the register header.
