iommu/arm-smmu: Plumb in new ACPI identifiers

Revision C of IORT now allows us to identify ARM MMU-401 and the Cavium
ThunderX implementation. Wire them up so that we can probe these models
once firmware starts using the new codes in place of generic ones, and
so that the appropriate features and quirks get enabled when we do.

For the sake of backports and mitigating sychronisation problems with
the ACPICA headers, we'll carry a backup copy of the new definitions
locally for the short term to make life simpler.
