drm/i915: Reinstate reservation_object zapping for batch_pool objects

I removed the zapping of the reservation_object->fence array of shared
fences prematurely. We don't yet have the code to zap that array when
retiring the object, and so currently it remains possible to continually
grow the shared array trapping requests when reusing the batch_pool
object across many timelines.
