MIPS: Add CPU shared FTLB feature detection

Some systems share FTLB RAMs or entries between sibling CPUs (ie.
hardware threads, or VP(E)s, within a core). These properties require
kernel handling in various places. As a start this patch introduces
cpu_has_shared_ftlb_ram & cpu_has_shared_ftlb_entries feature macros
which we set appropriately for I6400 & I6500 CPUs. Further patches will
make use of these macros as appropriate.
