rtc: gemini/ftrtc010: rename driver and symbols

The Gemini RTC is actually a generic IP block from Faraday
Technology names FTRTC010. Rename the driver file and all
symbols to match this IP name.

The relationship can be clearly seen in the U-Boot driver
posted by Po-Yu Chuang for the Faraday A320 board:

Remove the dependency on ARCH_GEMINI but select the driver
for ARCH_GEMINI so we get a smooth transition. The IP block
is synthsized on different silicon and architectures.
