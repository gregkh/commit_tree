drm/i915/g4x: Improve gpu reset reliability

ELK seems to very picky about the preconditions to reset.
Evidence on Eaglelake (8086:2e12 (rev 03)) shows that it does
not like if reset occurs when there is active ring.

Ville found out that there is workaround with name
'WaMediaResetMainRingCleanup' which suggests that we need to
cleanup rings before resetting. It is unclear what cleanup
exactly means but evidence shows that stopping the ring
does have an effect on reset reliability. This patch makes
reset successful on hangs induced by chained batches (the igt ones).
Note that if the hang is inside a shader, it is possible
that our attempts to stop the ring achieves anything.

v2: zero ctl,head,tail also. bug ref. use driver debugs (Chris)
v3: specify platform on testcases, comment tidyup (Chris)
