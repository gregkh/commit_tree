arm64: Use arch_timer_get_rate when trapping CNTFRQ_EL0

In an ideal world, CNTFRQ_EL0 always contains the timer frequency
for the kernel to use. Sadly, we get quite a few broken systems
where the firmware authors cannot be bothered to program that
register on all CPUs, and rely on DT to provide that frequency.

So when trapping CNTFRQ_EL0, make sure to return the actual rate
(as known by the kernel), and not CNTFRQ_EL0.
