libceph: fallback for when there isn't a pool-specific choose_arg

There is now a fallback to a choose_arg index of -1 if there isn't
a pool-specific choose_arg set.  If you create a per-pool weight-set,
that works for that pool.  Otherwise we try the compat/default one.  If
that doesn't exist either, then we use the normal CRUSH weights.
