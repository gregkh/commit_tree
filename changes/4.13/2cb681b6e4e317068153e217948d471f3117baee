drm/amdgpu:re-write sriov_reinit_early/late (v2)

1,this way we make those routines compatible with the sequence
  requirment for both Tonga and Vega10
2,ignore PSP hw init when doing TDR, because for SR-IOV device
the ucode won't get lost after VF FLR, so no need to invoke PSP
doing the ucode reloading again.

v2: squash in ARRAY_SIZE fix
