scsi: lpfc: Fix nvme io stoppage after link bounce

On link down, transport is calling driver to abort outstanding ios.
Driver erroneously rejects the abort if the port indicates it isn't
logged in - which will be the case after the link down. Thus, the io
can't clean up. This prevents reconnection at the transport level.

Fix by allowing abort to proceed.
