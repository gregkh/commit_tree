rcuperf: Add writer_holdoff boot parameter

This commit adds a writer_holdoff boot parameter to rcuperf, which is
intended to be used to test Tree SRCU's auto-expediting.  This
boot parameter is in microseconds, and defaults to zero (that is,
disabled).  Set it to a bit larger than srcutree.exp_holdoff,
keeping the nanosecond/microsecond conversion, to force Tree SRCU
to auto-expedite more aggressively.

This commit also adds documentation for this parameter, and fixes some
alphabetization while in the neighborhood.
