sched/clock: Use late_initcall() instead of sched_init_smp()

Core2 marks its TSC unstable in ACPI Processor Idle, which is probed
after sched_init_smp(). Luckily it appears both acpi_processor and
intel_idle (which has a similar check) are mandatory built-in.

This means we can delay switching to stable until after these drivers
have ran (if they were modules, this would be impossible).

Delay the stable switch to late_initcall() to allow these drivers to
mark TSC unstable and avoid difficult stable->unstable transitions.
