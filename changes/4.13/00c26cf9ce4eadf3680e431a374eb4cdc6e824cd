drm/i915: Remove toplevel struct_mutex locking from debugfs/i915_drop_caches

I have a plan to write a quick test to exercise concurrent usage of
i915_gem_shrink(), the simplest way looks to be to have multiple threads
using debugfs/i915_drop_caches. However, we currently take one lock over
the entire function, serialising the calls into i915_gem_shrink() so
reduce the lock coverage.

Testcase: igt/gem_shrink/reclaim
