KVM: arm/arm64: optimize VCPU RUN

We can make a small optimization by not checking the state of
the power_off field on each run. This is done by treating
power_off like pause, only checking it when we get the EXIT
VCPU request. When a VCPU powers off another VCPU the EXIT
request is already made, so we just need to make sure the
request is also made on self power off. kvm_vcpu_kick() isn't
necessary for these cases, as the VCPU would just be kicking
itself, but we add it anyway as a self kick doesn't cost much,
and it makes the code more future-proof.
