cpuidle: powerpc: cpuidle set polling before enabling irqs

local_irq_enable can cause interrupts to be taken which could
take significant amount of processing time. The idle process
should set its polling flag before this, so another process that
wakes it during this time will not have to send an IPI.

Expand the TIF_POLLING_NRFLAG coverage to as large as possible.
