net: dsa: change scope of STP state setter

Instead of having multiple STP state helpers scoping a slave device
supporting both the DSA logic and the switchdev binding, provide a
single dsa_port_set_state helper scoping a DSA port, as well as its
dsa_port_set_state_now wrapper which skips the prepare phase.

This allows us to better separate the DSA logic from the slave device
handling.
