x86/mm: Reimplement flush_tlb_page() using flush_tlb_mm_range()

flush_tlb_page() was very similar to flush_tlb_mm_range() except that
it had a couple of issues:

 - It was missing an smp_mb() in the case where
   current->active_mm != mm.  (This is a longstanding bug reported by Nadav Amit)

 - It was missing tracepoints and vm counter updates.

The only reason that I can see for keeping it at as a separate
function is that it could avoid a few branches that
flush_tlb_mm_range() needs to decide to flush just one page.  This
hardly seems worthwhile.  If we decide we want to get rid of those
branches again, a better way would be to introduce an
__flush_tlb_mm_range() helper and make both flush_tlb_page() and
flush_tlb_mm_range() use it.
