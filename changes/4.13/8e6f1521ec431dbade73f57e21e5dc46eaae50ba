net: dsa: mediatek: add adjust link support for user ports

Manually adjust the port settings of user ports once PHY polling has
completed. This patch extends the adjust_link callback to configure the
per port PMCR register, applying the proper values polled from the PHY.
Without this patch flow control was not always getting setup properly.
