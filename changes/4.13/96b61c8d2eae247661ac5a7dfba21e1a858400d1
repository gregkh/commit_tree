clk: meson: gxbb: remove the "cpu_clk" from the GXBB and GXL driver

It seems that the "cpu_clk" was carried over from the meson8b clock
controller driver. On Meson GX (GXBB/GXL/GXM) the registers which are
used by the cpu_clk have a different purpose (in other words: they don't
control the CPU clock anymore). HHI_SYS_CPU_CLK_CNTL1 bits 31:24 are
reserved according to the public S905 datasheet, while bit 23 is the
"A53_trace_clk_DIS" gate (which according to the datasheet should only
be used in case a silicon bug is discovered) and bits 22:20 are a
divider (A53_trace_clk). The meson clk-cpu code however expects that
bits 28:20 are reserved for a divider (according to the public S805
datasheet this "SCALE_DIV: This value represents an N+1 divider of the
input clock.").

The CPU clock on Meson GX SoCs is provided by the SCPI DVFS clock
driver instead. Two examples from a Meson GXL S905X SoC:
- vcpu (SCPI DVFS clock 0) rate: 1000000000 / cpu_clk rate: 708000000
- vcpu (SCPI DVFS clock 0) rate: 1512000000 / cpu_clk rate: 708000000

Unfortunately the CLKID_CPUCLK was already exported (but is currently
not used) to DT. Due to the removal of this clock definition there is
now a hole in the clk_hw_onecell_data (which is not a problem because
this case is already handled in gxbb_clkc_probe).
