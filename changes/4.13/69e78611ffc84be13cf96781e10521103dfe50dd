[media] media: imx: csi: add sink selection rectangles

Move the crop rectangle to the sink pad and add a sink compose rectangle
to configure scaling. Also propagate rectangles from sink pad to crop
rectangle, to compose rectangle, and to the source pads both in ACTIVE
and TRY variants of set_fmt/selection, and initialize the default crop
and compose rectangles.
