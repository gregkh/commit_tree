ext4: fix off-by-one fsmap error on 1k block filesystems

For 1k-block filesystems, the filesystem starts at block 1, not block 0.
This fact is recorded in s_first_data_block, so use that to bump up the
start_fsb before we start querying the filesystem for its space map.
Without this, ext4/026 fails on 1k block ext4 because various functions
(notably ext4_get_group_no_and_offset) don't know what to do with an
fsblock that is "before" the start of the filesystem and return garbage
results (blockgroup 2^32-1, etc.) that confuse fsmap.
