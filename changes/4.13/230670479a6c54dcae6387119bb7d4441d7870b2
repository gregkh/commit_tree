dt-bindings: power: supply: Add battery.txt with simple-battery binding

Documentation of static battery characteristics that can be defined
for batteries that do not embed this data, which are required by
fuel-gauge and charger chips for proper handling of the battery.

The following properties are defined:
  voltage-min-design-microvolt
  charge-full-design-microamp-hours
  energy-full-design-microwatt-hours
  precharge-current-microamp
  charge-term-current-microamp
  constant-charge-current-max-microamp
  constant-charge-voltage-max-microamp

Property names are derived from corresponding elements in
enum power_supply_property from include/linux/power_supply.h
