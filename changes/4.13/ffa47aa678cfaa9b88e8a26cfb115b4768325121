ARM: Prepare for randomized task_struct

With the new task struct randomization, we can run into a build
failure for certain random seeds, which will place fields beyond
the allow immediate size in the assembly:

arch/arm/kernel/entry-armv.S: Assembler messages:
arch/arm/kernel/entry-armv.S:803: Error: bad immediate value for offset (4096)

Only two constants in asm-offset.h are affected, and I'm changing
both of them here to work correctly in all configurations.

One more macro has the problem, but is currently unused, so this
removes it instead of adding complexity.
