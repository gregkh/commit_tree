blk-mq: merge bio into sw queue before plugging

Before blk-mq is introduced, I/O is merged to elevator
before being putted into plug queue, but blk-mq changed the
order and makes merging to sw queue basically impossible.
Then it is observed that throughput of sequential I/O is degraded
about 10%~20% on virtio-blk in the test[1] if mq-deadline isn't used.

This patch moves the bio merging per sw queue before plugging,
like what blk_queue_bio() does, and the performance regression is
fixed under this situation.

[1]. test script:
sudo fio --direct=1 --size=128G --bsrange=4k-4k --runtime=40 --numjobs=16 --ioengine=libaio --iodepth=64 --group_reporting=1 --filename=/dev/vdb --name=virtio_blk-test-$RW --rw=$RW --output-format=json
