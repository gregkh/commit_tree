drm/i915: Unwrap top level fence-array

By first unwrapping an incoming fence-array into its child fences, we
can simplify the internal branching, and so avoid triggering a potential
bug in the next patch when not squashing the child fences on the same
timeline.

It will also have the advantage of keeping the (top-level) fence arrays
out of any fence/timeline caching since these are unordered timelines
but with a random context id.
