nfs: add export operations

This support for opening files on NFS by file handle, both through the
open_by_handle syscall, and for re-exporting NFS (for example using a
different version).  The support is very basic for now, as each open by
handle will have to do an NFSv4 open operation on the wire.  In the
future this will hopefully be mitigated by an open file cache, as well
as various optimizations in NFS for this specific case.
