sed regex in Makefile.build requires line break between exported symbols

The following regex in Makefile.build matches only one ___EXPORT_SYMBOL per line.

sed
's/.*___EXPORT_SYMBOL[[:space:]]*\([a-zA-Z0-9_]*\)[[:space:]]*,.*/EXPORT_SYMBOL(\1);/'

ATOMIC_OPS macro in atomic_64.S expands multiple symbols in same line hence
version generation is done only for the last matched symbol. This patch adds
new line between the symbol expansions.
