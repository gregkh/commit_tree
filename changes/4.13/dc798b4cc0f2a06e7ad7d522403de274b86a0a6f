net/mlx5: Consider tx_enabled in all modes on remap

The tx_enabled lag event field is used to determine whether a slave is
active.
Current logic uses this value only if the mode is active-backup.

However, LACP mode, although considered a load balancing mode, can mark
a slave as inactive in certain situations (e.g., LACP timeout).

This fix takes the tx_enabled value into account when remapping, with
no respect to the LAG mode (this should not affect the behavior in XOR
mode, since in this mode both slaves are marked as active).
