drm/amdgpu: workaround tonga HW bug in HQD programming sequence

Tonga based asics may experience hangs when an HQD's EOP parameters
are modified.

Workaround this HW issue by avoiding writes to these registers for
tonga asics.

Based on the following ROCm commit:
2a0fb8 - drm/amdgpu: Synchronize KFD HQD load protocol with CP scheduler

From the ROCm git repository:
