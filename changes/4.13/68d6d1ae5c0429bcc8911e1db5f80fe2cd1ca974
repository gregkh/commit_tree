rxrpc: Separate the connection's protocol service ID from the lookup ID

Keep the rxrpc_connection struct's idea of the service ID that is exposed
in the protocol separate from the service ID that's used as a lookup key.

This allows the protocol service ID on a client connection to get upgraded
without making the connection unfindable for other client calls that also
would like to use the upgraded connection.

The connection's actual service ID is then returned through recvmsg() by
way of msg_name.

Whilst we're at it, we get rid of the last_service_id field from each
channel.  The service ID is per-connection, not per-call and an entire
connection is upgraded in one go.
