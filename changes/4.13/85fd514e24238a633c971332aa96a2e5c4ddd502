kvm: nVMX: Shadow "high" parts of shadowed 64-bit VMCS fields

Inconsistencies result from shadowing only accesses to the full
64-bits of a 64-bit VMCS field, but not shadowing accesses to the high
32-bits of the field. The "high" part of a 64-bit field should be
shadowed whenever the full 64-bit field is shadowed.
