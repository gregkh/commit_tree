platform/chrome: cros_ec_lightbar - Control of suspend/resume lightbar sequence

Don't let EC control suspend/resume sequence. If the EC controls the
lightbar and sets the sequence when it notices the chipset transitioning
between states, we can't make exceptions for cases where we don't want
to activate the lightbar. Instead, let's move the suspend/resume
notifications into the kernel so we can selectively play the sequences.
