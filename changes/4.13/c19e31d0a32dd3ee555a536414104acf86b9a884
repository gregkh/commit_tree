mtd: nand: denali: rework interrupt handling

Simplify the interrupt handling and fix issues:

- The register field view of INTR_EN / INTR_STATUS is different
  among IP versions.  The global macro DENALI_IRQ_ALL is hard-coded
  for Intel platforms.  The interrupt mask should be determined at
  run-time depending on the running platform.

- wait_for_irq() loops do {} while() until interested flags are
  asserted.  The logic can be simplified.

- The spin_lock() guard seems too complex (and suspicious in a race
  condition if wait_for_completion_timeout() bails out by timeout).

- denali->complete is reused again and again, but reinit_completion()
  is missing.  Add it.

Re-work the code to make it more robust and easier to handle.

While we are here, also rename the jump label "failed_req_irq" to
more appropriate "disable_irq".
