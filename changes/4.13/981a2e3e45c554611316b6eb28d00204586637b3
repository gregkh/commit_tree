crypto: tcrypt - don't disable irqs and wait

The tcrypt AEAD cycles speed tests disables irqs during the test, which is
broken at the very least since commit
'1425d2d17f7309c6 ("crypto: tcrypt - Fix AEAD speed tests")'
adds a wait for completion as part of the test and probably since
switching to the new AEAD API.

While the result of taking a cycle count diff may not mean much on SMP
systems if the task migrates, it's good enough for tcrypt being the quick
& dirty dev tool it is. It's also what all the other (i.e. hash) cycle
speed tests do.
