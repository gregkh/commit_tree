device-dax: fix 'passing zero to ERR_PTR()' warning

Dan Carpenter reports:

    The patch 7b6be8444e0f: "dax: refactor dax-fs into a generic provider
    of 'struct dax_device' instances" from Apr 11, 2017, leads to the
    following static checker warning:

        drivers/dax/device.c:643 devm_create_dev_dax()
        warn: passing zero to 'ERR_PTR'

Fix the case where we inadvertently leak 0 to ERR_PTR() by setting at
every error case, and make it clear that 'count' is never 0.
