crypto: caam - fix signals handling

Driver does not properly handle the case when signals interrupt
wait_for_completion_interruptible():
-it does not check for return value
-completion structure is allocated on stack; in case a signal interrupts
the sleep, it will go out of scope, causing the worker thread
(caam_jr_dequeue) to fail when it accesses it

wait_for_completion_interruptible() is replaced with uninterruptable
wait_for_completion().
We choose to block all signals while waiting for I/O (device executing
the split key generation job descriptor) since the alternative - in
order to have a deterministic device state - would be to flush the job
ring (aborting *all* in-progress jobs).
