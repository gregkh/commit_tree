mtd: blkdevs: Fix mtd block write failure

All the MTD block write requests are failing with
following error messages

    mkfs.ext4  /dev/mtdblock0

    print_req_error: I/O error, dev mtdblock0, sector 0
    Buffer I/O error on dev mtdblock0, logical block 0,
    lost async page write

The control is going to default case after block write request
because of missing return.

Fixes: commit 2a842acab109 ("block: introduce new block status code type")
