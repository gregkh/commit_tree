sunvdc: prevent sunvdc panic when mpgroup disk added to guest domain

Using mpgroup to define multiple paths for a virtual disk causes multiple
virtual-device-port ports to be created for that virtual device.
Each virtual-device-port port then gets a vdisk created for it by the Linux
sunvdc driver. As mpgroup is not supported by the Linux sunvdc driver it
cannot handle multiple ports for a single vdisk, leading to a kernel panic
at startup.

This fix prevents more than one vdisk per virtual-device-port being created
until full virtual disk multipathing (mpgroup) support is implemented.
