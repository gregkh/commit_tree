ASoC: fsi: Move inline fsi_stream_is_play() before use

With gcc 4.1.2:

    sound/soc/sh/fsi.c:304: warning: ‘fsi_stream_is_play’ declared inline after being called
    sound/soc/sh/fsi.c:304: warning: previous declaration of ‘fsi_stream_is_play’ was here

Move fsi_stream_is_play() up to fix this, removing the need for a
forward declaration as well.
