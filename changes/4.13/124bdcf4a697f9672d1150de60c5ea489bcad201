tpm: fix byte order related arithmetic inconsistency in tpm_getcap()

You should not do arithmetic with __be32 or __le32 types because
sometimes it results incorrect results. Calculations must be done only
with integers that are in in the CPU byte order. This commit migrates
tpm_getcap() to struct tpm_buf in order to sort out these issues.
