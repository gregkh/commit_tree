drm/i915/cnp: Introduce Cannonpoint PCH.

Most of south engine display that is in PCH is still the
same as SPT and KBP, except for this key differences:

- Backlight: Backlight programming changed in CNP PCH.
- Panel Power: Sligh programming changed in CNP PCH.
- GMBUS and GPIO: The pin mapping has changed in CNP PCH.

All of these changes follow more the BXT style.

v2: Update definition to use dev_priv isntead of dev (Tvrtko).
