genirq/affinity: Assign vectors to all present CPUs

Currently the irq vector spread algorithm is restricted to online CPUs,
which ties the IRQ mapping to the currently online devices and doesn't deal
nicely with the fact that CPUs could come and go rapidly due to e.g. power
management.

Instead assign vectors to all present CPUs to avoid this churn.

Build a map of all possible CPUs for a given node, as the architectures
only provide a map of all onlines CPUs. Do this dynamically on each call
for the vector assingments, which is a bit suboptimal and could be
optimized in the future by provinding a mapping from the arch code.
