PCI: Add pci_reset_function_locked()

The implementation of PCI workarounds may require that the device is reset
from its probe function.  This implies that the PCI device lock is already
held, and makes calling pci_reset_function() impossible (since it will
itself try to take that lock).

Add pci_reset_function_locked(), which is the equivalent of
pci_reset_function(), except that it requires the PCI device lock to be
already held by the caller.
