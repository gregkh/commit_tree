mux: minimal mux subsystem

Add a new minimalistic subsystem that handles multiplexer controllers.
When multiplexers are used in various places in the kernel, and the
same multiplexer controller can be used for several independent things,
there should be one place to implement support for said multiplexer
controller.

A single multiplexer controller can also be used to control several
parallel multiplexers, that are in turn used by different subsystems
in the kernel, leading to a need to coordinate multiplexer accesses.
The multiplexer subsystem handles this coordination.

Thanks go out to Lars-Peter Clausen, Jonathan Cameron, Rob Herring,
Wolfram Sang, Paul Gortmaker, Dan Carpenter, Colin Ian King, Greg
Kroah-Hartman and last but certainly not least to Philipp Zabel for
helpful comments, reviews, patches and general encouragement!
