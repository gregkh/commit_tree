mmc: sdhci-pci: Use macros in pci_ids definition

This patch applies customized PCI_DEVICE_ macros to specify the pci_ids
instead of open-coding them within the sdhci-pci driver.

By introducing device specific macros the pci_ids table becomes much
shorter and easier to comprehend than it would be possible using the
generic version of the PCI_DEVICE_ macros.
