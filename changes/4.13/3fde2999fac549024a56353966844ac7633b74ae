arm64: cpufeature: Don't dump useless backtrace on CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC

Unfortunately, it turns out that mismatched CPU features in big.LITTLE
systems are starting to appear in the wild. Whilst we should continue to
taint the kernel with CPU_OUT_OF_SPEC for features that differ in ways
that we can't fix up, dumping a useless backtrace out of the cpufeature
code is pointless and irritating.

This patch removes the backtrace from the taint.
