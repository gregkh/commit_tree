switchtec: Add "running" status flag to fw partition info ioctl

This flag lets userspace know which firmware partitions are currently in
use as opposed to just active.  "Active" means they will be in use for the
next reboot, whereas "running" means they are currently in use.

If an old kernel is in use, or the firmware doesn't support these fields,
the new flag will not be set in the output.
