randstruct: opt-out externally exposed function pointer structs

Some function pointer structures are used externally to the kernel, like
the paravirt structures. These should never be randomized, so mark them
as such, in preparation for enabling randstruct's automatic selection
of all-function-pointer structures.

These markings are verbatim from Brad Spengler/PaX Team's code in the
last public patch of grsecurity/PaX based on my understanding of the
code. Changes or omissions from the original code are mine and don't
reflect the original grsecurity/PaX code.
