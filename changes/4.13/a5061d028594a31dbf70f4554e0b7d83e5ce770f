firmware: google: memconsole: Adapt to new coreboot ring buffer format

The upstream coreboot implementation of memconsole was enhanced from a
single-boot console to a persistent ring buffer
(https://review.coreboot.org/#/c/18301). This patch changes the kernel
memconsole driver to be able to read the new format in all cases.
