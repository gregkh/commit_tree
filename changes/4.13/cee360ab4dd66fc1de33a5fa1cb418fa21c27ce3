sctp: define the member stream as an object instead of pointer in asoc

As Marcelo's suggestion, stream is a fixed size member of asoc and would
not grow with more streams. To avoid an allocation for it, this patch is
to define it as an object instead of pointer and update the places using
it, also create sctp_stream_update() called in sctp_assoc_update() to
migrate the stream info from one stream to another.
