x86/platform/uv/BAU: Disable BAU on single hub configurations

The BAU confers no benefit to a UV system running with only one hub/socket.
Permanently disable the BAU driver if there are less than two hubs online
to avoid BAU overhead. We have observed failed boots on single-socket UV4
systems caused by BAU that are avoided with this patch.

Also, while at it, consolidate initialization error blocks and fix a
memory leak.
