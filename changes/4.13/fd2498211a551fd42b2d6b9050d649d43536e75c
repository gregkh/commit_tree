afs: Ignore AFS_ACE_READ and AFS_ACE_WRITE for directories

The AFS_ACE_READ and AFS_ACE_WRITE permission bits should not
be used to make access decisions for the directory itself.  They
are meant to control access for the objects contained in that
directory.

Reading a directory is allowed if the AFS_ACE_LOOKUP bit is set.
This would cause an incorrect access denied error for a directory
with AFS_ACE_LOOKUP but not AFS_ACE_READ.

The AFS_ACE_WRITE bit does not allow operations that modify the
directory.  For a directory with AFS_ACE_WRITE but neither
AFS_ACE_INSERT nor AFS_ACE_DELETE, this would result in trying
operations that would ultimately be denied by the server.
