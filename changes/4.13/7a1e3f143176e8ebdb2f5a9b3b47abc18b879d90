mmc: sdhci-of-at91: force card detect value for non removable devices

When the device is non removable, the card detect signal is often used
for another purpose i.e. muxed to another SoC peripheral or used as a
GPIO. It could lead to wrong behaviors depending the default value of
this signal if not muxed to the SDHCI controller.
