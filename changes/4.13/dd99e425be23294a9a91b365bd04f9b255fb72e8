udp: prefetch rmem_alloc in udp_queue_rcv_skb()

On UDP packets processing, if the BH is the bottle-neck, it
always sees a cache miss while updating rmem_alloc; try to
avoid it prefetching the value as soon as we have the socket
available.

Performances under flood with multiple NIC rx queues used are
unaffected, but when a single NIC rx queue is in use, this
gives ~10% performance improvement.
