s390/vdso: use _install_special_mapping to establish vdso

Switch to the improved _install_special_mapping function to install
the vdso mapping. This has two advantages, the arch_vma_name function
is not needed anymore and the vdso vma still has its name after its
memory location has been changed with mremap.
