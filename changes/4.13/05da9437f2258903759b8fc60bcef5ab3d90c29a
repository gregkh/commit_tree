[media] ddbridge: support STV0367-based cards and modules

This adds detection and activation for STV0367-based tuner hardware (namely
CineCTv6 bridge cards and older DuoFlex CT addon modules). Utilises the
extended stv0367 demod driver.

TDA18212 i2c_client/regmap-api code was originally implemented by
Antti Palosaari <crope@iki.fi> in a variant to update the ddbridge code
from the vendor dddvb package (formal ack for these parts received).
Original patch at [1].

When boards with STV0367 are cold-started, there might be issues with the
I2C gate, causing the TDA18212 detection/probe to fail. For these demods,
a workaround (tuner_tda18212_ping) is implemented which probes the tuner
twice on this hardware constellation which will resolve the problem and
put all components into a working state. Other demod/port types won't be
retried.
