KVM: SVM: hide TF/RF flags used by NMI singlestep

These flags are used internally by SVM so it's cleaner to not leak
them to callers of svm_get_rflags. This is similar to how the TF
flag is handled on KVM_GUESTDBG_SINGLESTEP by kvm_get_rflags and
kvm_set_rflags.

Without this change, the flags may propagate from host VMCB to nested
VMCB or vice versa while singlestepping over a nested VM enter/exit,
and then get stuck in inappropriate places.

Example: NMI singlestepping is enabled while running L1 guest. The
instruction to step over is VMRUN and nested vmrun emulation stashes
rflags to hsave->save.rflags. Then if singlestepping is disabled
while still in L2, TF/RF will be cleared from the nested VMCB but the
next nested VM exit will restore them from hsave->save.rflags and
cause an unexpected DB exception.
