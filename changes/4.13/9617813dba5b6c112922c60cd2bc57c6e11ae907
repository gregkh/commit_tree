skbuff: add stub to help computing crc32c on SCTP packets

sctp_compute_checksum requires crc32c symbol (provided by libcrc32c), so
it can't be used in net core. Like it has been done previously with other
symbols (e.g. ipv6_dst_lookup), introduce a stub struct skb_checksum_ops
to allow computation of crc32c checksum in net core after sctp.ko (and thus
libcrc32c) has been loaded.
