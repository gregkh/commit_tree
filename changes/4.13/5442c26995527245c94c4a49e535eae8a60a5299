x86/cpufeature, kvm/svm: Rename (shorten) the new "virtualized VMSAVE/VMLOAD" CPUID flag

"virtual_vmload_vmsave" is what is going to land in /proc/cpuinfo now
as per v4.13-rc4, for a single feature bit which is clearly too long.

So rename it to what it is called in the processor manual.
"v_vmsave_vmload" is a bit shorter, after all.

We could go more aggressively here but having it the same as in the
processor manual is advantageous.
