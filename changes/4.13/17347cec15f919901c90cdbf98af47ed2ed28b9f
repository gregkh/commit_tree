Btrfs: change how we iterate bios in endio

Since dio submit has used bio_clone_fast, the submitted bio may not have a
reliable bi_vcnt, for the bio vector iterations in checksum related
functions, bio->bi_iter is not modified yet and it's safe to use
bio_for_each_segment, while for those bio vector iterations in dio read's
endio, we now save a copy of bvec_iter in struct btrfs_io_bio when cloning
bios and use the helper __bio_for_each_segment with the saved bvec_iter to
access each bvec.

Also for dio reads which don't get split, we also need to save a copy of
bio iterator in btrfs_bio_clone to let __bio_for_each_segments to access
each bvec in dio read's endio.  Note that it doesn't affect other calls of
btrfs_bio_clone() because they don't need to use this iterator.
