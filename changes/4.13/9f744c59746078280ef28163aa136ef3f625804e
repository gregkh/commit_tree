KVM: nVMX: do not pin the VMCS12

Since the current implementation of VMCS12 does a memcpy in and out
of guest memory, we do not need current_vmcs12 and current_vmcs12_page
anymore.  current_vmptr is enough to read and write the VMCS12.

And David Matlack noted:

  This patch also fixes dirty tracking (memslot->dirty_bitmap) of the
  VMCS12 page by using kvm_write_guest. nested_release_page() only marks
  the struct page dirty.
