drm/sun4i: Use lists to track registered display backends and TCONs

To support multiple display pipelines, we need to keep track of the
multiple display backends and TCONs registered with the driver.

Switch to lists to track registered components. Components are only
appended to their respective lists if the bind process was successful.
The TCON bind function now defers if a backend was not registered.
