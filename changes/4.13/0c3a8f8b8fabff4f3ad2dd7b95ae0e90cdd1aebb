netpoll: Fix device name check in netpoll_setup()

Apparently netpoll_setup() assumes that netpoll.dev_name is a pointer
when checking if the device name is set:

if (np->dev_name) {
  ...

However the field is a character array, therefore the condition always
yields true. Check instead whether the first byte of the array has a
non-zero value.
