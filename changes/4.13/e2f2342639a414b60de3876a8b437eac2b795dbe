xfs: refactor xlog_cil_insert_items() to facilitate transaction dump

Transaction reservation overrun detection currently occurs too late
to print useful information about the offending transaction.
Ideally, the transaction data is printed before the associated log
items are moved from the transaction to the CIL, which occurs in
xlog_cil_insert_items(), such that details of the items logged by
the transaction are available for analysis.

Refactor xlog_cil_insert_items() to facilitate moving tx overrun
detection to this function. Update the function to track each bit of
extra log reservation stolen from the transaction (i.e., such as for
the CIL context ticket) and perform the log item migration as the
last operation before the CIL lock is released. This creates a
context where the transaction reservation consumption has been fully
calculated when the log items are moved to the CIL. This patch makes
no functional changes.
