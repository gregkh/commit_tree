staging: comedi: ni_mio_common: fix AO timer off-by-one regression

As reported by Éric Piel on the Comedi mailing list (see
<https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comedi_list/ueZiR7vTLOU/discussion>),
the analog output asynchronous commands are running too fast with a
period 50 ns shorter than it should be.  This affects all boards with AO
command support that are supported by the "ni_pcimio", "ni_atmio", and
"ni_mio_cs" drivers.

This is a regression bug introduced by commit 080e6795cba3 ("staging:
comedi: ni_mio_common: Cleans up/clarifies ni_ao_cmd"), specifically,
this line in `ni_ao_cmd_set_update()`:

		/* following line: N-1 per STC */
		ni_stc_writel(dev, trigvar - 1, NISTC_AO_UI_LOADA_REG);

The `trigvar` variable value comes from a call to `ni_ns_to_timer()`
which converts a timer period in nanoseconds to a hardware divisor
value. The function already reduces the divisor by 1 as required by the
hardware, so the above line should not reduce it further by 1.  Fix it
by replacing `trigvar` by `trigvar - 1` in the above line, and remove
the misleading comment.
