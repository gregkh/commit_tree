mm/vmscan.c: fix unsequenced modification and access warning

Clang and its -Wunsequenced emits a warning

  mm/vmscan.c:2961:25: error: unsequenced modification and access to 'gfp_mask' [-Wunsequenced]
                  .gfp_mask = (gfp_mask = current_gfp_context(gfp_mask)),
                                        ^

While it is not clear to me whether the initialization code violates the
specification (6.7.8 par 19 (ISO/IEC 9899) looks like it disagrees) the
code is quite confusing and worth cleaning up anyway.  Fix this by
reusing sc.gfp_mask rather than the updated input gfp_mask parameter.
