sched/fair: WARN() and refuse to set buddy when !se->on_rq

If we set a next or last buddy for a se that is not on_rq, we will
end up taking a NULL pointer dereference in wakeup_preempt_entity
via pick_next_task_fair.

Detect when we would be about to do that, throw a warning and
then refuse to actually set it.

This has been suggested at least twice:

I recently had to debug a problem with these (we hadn't backported
Konstantin's patches in this area) and this would have saved a lot
of time/pain.

Just do it.
