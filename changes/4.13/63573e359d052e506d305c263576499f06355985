bio-integrity: Restore original iterator on verify stage

Currently ->verify_fn not woks at all because at the moment it is called
bio->bi_iter.bi_size == 0, so we do not iterate integrity bvecs at all.

In order to perform verification we need to know original data vector,
with new bvec rewind API this is trivial.
