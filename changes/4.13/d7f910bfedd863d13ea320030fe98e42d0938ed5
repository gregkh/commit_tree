ALSA: timer: Wrap with spinlock for queue access

For accessing the snd_timer_user queue indices, we take tu->qlock.
But it's forgotten in a couple of places.

The one in snd_timer_user_params() should be safe without the
spinlock as the timer is already stopped.  But it's better for
consistency.

The one in poll is just a read-out, so it's not inevitably needed, but
it'd be good to make the result consistent, too.
