kernel/watchdog: remove unused declaration

Patch series "Improve watchdog config for arch watchdogs", v4.

A series to make the hardlockup watchdog more easily replaceable by arch
code.  The last patch provides some justification for why we want to do
this (existing sparc watchdog is another that could benefit).

This patch (of 5):

Remove unused declaration.
