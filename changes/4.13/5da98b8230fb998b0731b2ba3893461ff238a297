pi-futex.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx.

This document requires just minor adjustments to match
the standard documentation style:

- promote document name;
- remove extra collons on some chapter titles;
- use "-" for a bulleted list.
