virtio_pci: fix cpu affinity support

Commit 0b0f9dc5 ("Revert "virtio_pci: use shared interrupts for
virtqueues"") removed the adjustment of the pre_vectors for the virtio
MSI-X vector allocation which was added in commit fb5e31d9 ("virtio:
allow drivers to request IRQ affinity when creating VQs"). This will
lead to an incorrect assignment of MSI-X vectors, and potential
deadlocks when offlining cpus.
