net: more accurate checksumming in validate_xmit_skb()

skb_csum_hwoffload_help() uses netdev features and skb->csum_not_inet to
determine if skb needs software computation of Internet Checksum or crc32c
(or nothing, if this computation can be done by the hardware). Use it in
place of skb_checksum_help() in validate_xmit_skb() to avoid corruption
of non-GSO SCTP packets having skb->ip_summed equal to CHECKSUM_PARTIAL.

While at it, remove references to skb_csum_off_chk* functions, since they
are not present anymore in Linux  _ see commit cf53b1da73bd ("Revert
 "net: Add driver helper functions to determine checksum offloadability"").
