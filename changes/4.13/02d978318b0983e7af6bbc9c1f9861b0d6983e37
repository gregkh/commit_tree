[media] atomisp: Fix -Werror=int-in-bool-context compile errors

With gcc-7.1.1 I was getting the following compile error:

error: ‘*’ in boolean context, suggest ‘&&’ instead

The problem is the definition of CEIL_DIV:
 #define CEIL_DIV(a, b)       ((b) ? ((a) + (b) - 1) / (b) : 0)

Which when called as: CEIL_DIV(x, y * z) triggers this error, note
we cannot do as the error suggests since b is evaluated multiple times.

This commit fixes these compile errors.
