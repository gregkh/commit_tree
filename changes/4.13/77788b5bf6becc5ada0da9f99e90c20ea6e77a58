net/mlx4_en: Increase default TX ring size

Increase the default TX ring size (from 512 to 1024) to match
the RX ring size.
This gives the XDP TX ring a better chance to keep up with the
rate of its RX ring in case of a high load of XDP_TX actions.

Tested:
Ethtool counter rx_xdp_tx_full used to increase, after applying this
patch it stopped.
