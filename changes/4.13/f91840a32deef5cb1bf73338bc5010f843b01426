perf, bpf: Add BPF support to all perf_event types

Allow BPF_PROG_TYPE_PERF_EVENT program types to attach to all
perf_event types, including HW_CACHE, RAW, and dynamic pmu events.
Only tracepoint/kprobe events are treated differently which require
BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACEPOINT/BPF_PROG_TYPE_KPROBE program types accordingly.

Also add support for reading all event counters using
bpf_perf_event_read() helper.
