libnvdimm, pmem, dax: export a cache control attribute

The dax_flush() operation can be turned into a nop on platforms where
firmware arranges for cpu caches to be flushed on a power-fail event.
The ACPI 6.2 specification defines a mechanism for the platform to
indicate this capability so the kernel can select the proper default.
However, for other platforms, the administrator must toggle this setting
manually.

Given this flush setting is a dax-specific mechanism we advertise it
through a 'dax' attribute group hanging off a host device. For example,
a 'pmem0' block-device gets a 'dax' sysfs-subdirectory with a
'write_cache' attribute to control response to dax cache flush requests.
This is similar to the 'queue/write_cache' attribute that appears under
block devices.
