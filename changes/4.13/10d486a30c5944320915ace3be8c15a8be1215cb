netns: fix error code when the nsid is already used

When the user tries to assign a specific nsid, idr_alloc() is called with
the range [nsid, nsid+1]. If this nsid is already used, idr_alloc() returns
ENOSPC (No space left on device). In our case, it's better to return
EEXIST to make it clear that the nsid is not available.
