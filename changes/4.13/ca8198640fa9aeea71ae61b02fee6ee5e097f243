checkpatch: fix stepping through statements with $stat and ctx_statement_block

Fix the off-by-one in the suppression of lines in a statement block.

This means that for multiple line statements like

	foo(bar,
	    baz,
	    qux);

$stat has been inspected first correctly for the entire statement,
and subsequently incorrectly just for

	    qux);

This fix will help make tracking appropriate indentation a little easier.
