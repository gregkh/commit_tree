KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Don't let VCPU sleep if it has a doorbell pending

It is possible, through a narrow race condition, for a VCPU to exit
the guest with a H_CEDE hypercall while it has a doorbell interrupt
pending.  In this case, the H_CEDE should return immediately, but in
fact it puts the VCPU to sleep until some other interrupt becomes
pending or a prod is received (via another VCPU doing H_PROD).

This fixes it by checking the DPDES (Directed Privileged Doorbell
Exception Status) bit for the thread along with the other interrupt
pending bits.
