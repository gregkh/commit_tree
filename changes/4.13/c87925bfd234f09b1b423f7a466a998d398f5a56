crypto: inside-secure - enable single WR in DSE configuration

When enable_single_wr is not enabled, the DSE will only write those
parts of a result descriptor that need updating, which means a final
result descriptor will be written in 2 or 3 smaller transfers.
When enable_single_wr is enabled the DSE will combine these 2-3
updates into one large write transfer, generally improving performance.
