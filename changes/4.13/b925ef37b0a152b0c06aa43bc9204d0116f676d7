hysdn: fix to a race condition in put_log_buffer

The synchronization type that was used earlier to guard the loop that
deletes unused log buffers may lead to a situation that prevents any
thread from going through the loop.

The patch deletes previously used synchronization mechanism and moves
the loop under the spin_lock so the similar cases won't be feasible in
the future.
