ALSA: line6: remove unnecessary initialization to PODHD500X

Remove Initialization from POD HD500X because it's not needed.
Every time the device is connected dmesg gives the following output:
"receive length failed (error -11)".
To solve this problem, another flags is introduced
(LINE6_CAP_CONTROL_INFO) and it is only used for PODX3 in: sysfs
entries, call podhd_startup_finalize(pod) and disconnection.
With this patch the error disappear.
