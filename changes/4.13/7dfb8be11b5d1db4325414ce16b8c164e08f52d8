btrfs: Round down values which are written for total_bytes_size

We got an internal report about a file system not wanting to mount
following 99e3ecfcb9f4 ("Btrfs: add more validation checks for
superblock").

BTRFS error (device sdb1): super_total_bytes 1000203816960 mismatch with
fs_devices total_rw_bytes 1000203820544

Subtracting the numbers we get a difference of less than a 4kb. Upon
closer inspection it became apparent that mkfs actually rounds down the
size of the device to a multiple of sector size. However, the same
cannot be said for various functions which modify the total size and are
called from btrfs_balance as well as when adding a new device. So this
patch ensures that values being saved into on-disk data structures are
always rounded down to a multiple of sectorsize.
