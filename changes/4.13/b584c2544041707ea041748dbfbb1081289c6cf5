powerpc/vmemmap: Add altmap support

Adds support to powerpc for the altmap feature of ZONE_DEVICE memory. An
altmap is a driver provided region that is used to provide the backing
storage for the struct pages of ZONE_DEVICE memory. In situations where
large amount of ZONE_DEVICE memory is being added to the system the
altmap reduces pressure on main system memory by allowing the mm/
metadata to be stored on the device itself rather in main memory.
