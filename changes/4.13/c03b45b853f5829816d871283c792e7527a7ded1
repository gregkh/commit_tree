ext4, project: expand inode extra size if possible

When upgrading from old format, try to set project id
to old file first time, it will return EOVERFLOW, but if
that file is dirtied(touch etc), changing project id will
be allowed, this might be confusing for users, we could
try to expand @i_extra_isize here too.
