libceph: make encode_request_*() work with r_mempool requests

Messages allocated out of ceph_msgpool have a fixed front length
(pool->front_len).  Asserting that the entire front has been filled
while encoding is thus wrong.

Fixes: 8cb441c0545d ("libceph: MOSDOp v8 encoding (actual spgid + full hash)")
