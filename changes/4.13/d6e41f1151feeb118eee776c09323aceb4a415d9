x86/mm, KVM: Teach KVM's VMX code that CR3 isn't a constant

When PCID is enabled, CR3's PCID bits can change during context
switches, so KVM won't be able to treat CR3 as a per-mm constant any
more.

I structured this like the existing CR4 handling.  Under ordinary
circumstances (PCID disabled or if the current PCID and the value
that's already in the VMCS match), then we won't do an extra VMCS
write, and we'll never do an extra direct CR3 read.  The overhead
should be minimal.

I disallowed using the new helper in non-atomic context because
PCID support will cause CR3 to stop being constant in non-atomic
process context.

(Frankly, it also scares me a bit that KVM ever treated CR3 as
constant, but it looks like it was okay before.)
