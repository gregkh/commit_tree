xfs: use the common helper uuid_is_null()

Use the common helper uuid_is_null() and remove the xfs specific
helper uuid_is_nil().

The common helper does not check for the NULL pointer value as
xfs helper did, but xfs code never calls the helper with a pointer
that can be NULL.

Conform comments and warning strings to use the term 'null uuid'
instead of 'nil uuid', because this is the terminology used by
lib/uuid.c and its users. It is also the terminology used in
userspace by libuuid and xfsprogs.
