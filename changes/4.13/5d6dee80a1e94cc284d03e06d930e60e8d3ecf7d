vfio: New external user group/file match

At the point where the kvm-vfio pseudo device wants to release its
vfio group reference, we can't always acquire a new reference to make
that happen.  The group can be in a state where we wouldn't allow a
new reference to be added.  This new helper function allows a caller
to match a file to a group to facilitate this.  Given a file and
group, report if they match.  Thus the caller needs to already have a
group reference to match to the file.  This allows the deletion of a
group without acquiring a new reference.
