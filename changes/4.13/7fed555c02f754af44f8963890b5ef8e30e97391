drm/i915: expose _SLICE_MASK GETPARM

Enables userspace to determine the maximum number of slices that can
be enabled on the device and also know what specific slices can be
enabled. This information is required, for example, to be able to
analyse some OA counter reports where the counter configuration
depends on the HW slice configuration.
