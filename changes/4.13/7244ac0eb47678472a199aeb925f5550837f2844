mmc: sdhci-acpi: Remove unneeded acpi_bus_get_status() call

The acpi-subsys already calls acpi_bus_get_status() and checks that
device->status.present is set before even registering the platform_device
so out probe function will never get called if device->status.present is
false and there is no need for this check.
