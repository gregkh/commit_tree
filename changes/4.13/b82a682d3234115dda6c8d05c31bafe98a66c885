drm/i915: Drop pipe A quirk for Thinkapd T60

The pipe A force quirk shouldn't needed except on 830. So let's nuke it
for the IBM Thinkpad T60 945 machines. This quirk pre-dates
KMS so it's usefulness is doubtful at best now.

The original bug report [1] describes the symptoms as "system hang on
closing T60 panel lid", and we already dropped a similar quirk for
another 945 machine in
commit 736a69ca8c99 ("drm/i915: Drop PIPE-A quirk for 945GSE HP Mini")
so I'm hopeful we can drop this one as well.

The quirk was added into xf86-video-intel in
commit 08903abe4dc0 ("Add pipe a force enable quirk for Lenovo T60")
