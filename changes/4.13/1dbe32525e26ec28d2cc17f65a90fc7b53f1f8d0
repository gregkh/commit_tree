net: use loopback dev when generating blackhole route

Existing ipv4/6_blackhole_route() code generates a blackhole route
with dst->dev pointing to the passed in dst->dev.
It is not necessary to hold reference to the passed in dst->dev
because the packets going through this route are dropped anyway.
A loopback interface is good enough so that we don't need to worry about
releasing this dst->dev when this dev is going down.
