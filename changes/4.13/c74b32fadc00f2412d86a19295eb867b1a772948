PM / OPP: Reorganize _generic_set_opp_regulator()

The code was overly complicated here because of the limitations that we
had with RCUs (Couldn't use opp-table and OPPs outside RCU protected
section and can't call sleep-able routines from within that). But that
is long gone now.

Reorganize _generic_set_opp_regulator() in order to avoid using "struct
dev_pm_set_opp_data" and copying data into it for the case where
opp_table->set_opp is not set.
