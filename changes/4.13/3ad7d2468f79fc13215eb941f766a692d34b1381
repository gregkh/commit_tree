Ipvlan should return an error when an address is already in use.

The ipvlan code already knows how to detect when a duplicate address is
about to be assigned to an ipvlan device.  However, that failure is not
propogated outward and leads to a silent failure.

Introduce a validation step at ip address creation time and allow device
drivers to register to validate the incoming ip addresses.  The ipvlan
code is the first consumer.  If it detects an address in use, we can
return an error to the user before beginning to commit the new ifa in
the networking code.

This can be especially useful if it is necessary to provision many
ipvlans in containers.  The provisioning software (or operator) can use
this to detect situations where an ip address is unexpectedly in use.
