iwlwifi: mvm: disable prph collection in a000 hw

Apart from the current list of PRPH that can't be
collected in A000 HW, the rest of the debug dump
data the driver collects is valid, so there is no
need to disable collection only because of this.

Disable PRPH collecting in A000 HW, and allow
collecting the rest of the debug data.
