drm/i915: Fix system hang with EI UP masked on Haswell

Previously with commit a9c1f90c8e17
("drm/i915: Don't mask EI UP interrupt on IVB|SNB") certain,
seemingly unrelated bit (GEN6_PM_RP_UP_EI_EXPIRED) was needed
to be unmasked for IVB and SNB in order to prevent system hang
with chained batchbuffers.

Our CI was seeing incomplete results with tests that used
chained batches and it was found out that HSW needs to have this
same bit unmasked to reliably survive chained batches.

Always unmask GEN6_PM_RP_UP_EI_EXPIRED on Haswell to
prevent system hang with batch chaining.
