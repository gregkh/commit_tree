ext4: silence array overflow warning

I get a static checker warning:

    fs/ext4/ext4.h:3091 ext4_set_de_type()
    error: buffer overflow 'ext4_type_by_mode' 15 <= 15

It seems unlikely that we would hit this read overflow in real life, but
it's also simple enough to make the array 16 bytes instead of 15.
