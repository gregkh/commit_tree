KVM: arm/arm64: change exit request to sleep request

A request called EXIT is too generic. All requests are meant to cause
exits, but different requests have different flags. Let's not make
it difficult to decide if the EXIT request is correct for some case
by just always providing unique requests for each case. This patch
changes EXIT to SLEEP, because that's what the request is asking the
VCPU to do.
