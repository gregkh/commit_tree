KVM, pkeys: do not use PKRU value in vcpu->arch.guest_fpu.state

The host pkru is restored right after vcpu exit (commit 1be0e61), so
KVM_GET_XSAVE will return the host PKRU value instead.  Fix this by
using the guest PKRU explicitly in fill_xsave and load_xsave.  This
part is based on a patch by Junkang Fu.

The host PKRU data may also not match the value in vcpu->arch.guest_fpu.state,
because it could have been changed by userspace since the last time
it was saved, so skip loading it in kvm_load_guest_fpu.
