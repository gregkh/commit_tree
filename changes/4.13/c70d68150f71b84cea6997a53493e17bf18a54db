sfc: don't read beyond unicast address list

If we have more than 32 unicast MAC addresses assigned to an interface
we will read beyond the end of the address table in the driver when
adding filters. The next 256 entries store multicast addresses, so we
will end up attempting to insert duplicate filters, which is mostly
harmless. If we add more than 288 unicast addresses we will then read
past the multicast address table, which is likely to be more exciting.
