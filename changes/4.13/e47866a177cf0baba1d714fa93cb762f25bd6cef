pwm: cros-ec: Fix transposed param settings

The __cros_ec_pwm_get_duty() routine was transposing the insize and
outsize fields when calling cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status().

The original code worked without error due to size of the two particular
parameter blocks passed to cros_ec_cmd_xfer_status(), so this change is
not fixing an actual runtime problem, just correcting the calling usage.
