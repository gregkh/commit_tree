intel_txt.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- promote main title one level;
- fix the bulleted list markup;
- use bulletted list markup where needed;
- add whitespaces where needed;
- mark literal blocks;
- remove extra ":" after section titles.
