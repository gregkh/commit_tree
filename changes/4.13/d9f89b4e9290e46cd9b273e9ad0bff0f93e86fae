KVM: arm/arm64: PMU: Fix overflow interrupt injection

kvm_pmu_overflow_set() is called from perf's interrupt handler,
making the call of kvm_vgic_inject_irq() from it introduced with
"KVM: arm/arm64: PMU: remove request-less vcpu kick" a really bad
idea, as it's quite easy to try and retake a lock that the
interrupted context is already holding. The fix is to use a vcpu
kick, leaving the interrupt injection to kvm_pmu_sync_hwstate(),
like it was doing before the refactoring. We don't just revert,
though, because before the kick was request-less, leaving the vcpu
exposed to the request-less vcpu kick race, and also because the
kick was used unnecessarily from register access handlers.
