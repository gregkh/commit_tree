genirq: Provide irq_fixup_move_pending()

If an CPU goes offline, the interrupts are migrated away, but a eventually
pending interrupt move, which has not yet been made effective is kept
pending even if the outgoing CPU is the sole target of the pending affinity
mask. What's worse is, that the pending affinity mask is discarded even if
it would contain a valid subset of the online CPUs.

Implement a helper function which allows to avoid these issues.
