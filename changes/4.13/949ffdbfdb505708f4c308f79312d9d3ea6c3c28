[media] media: imx: csi: add frame size/interval enumeration

Add frame size and frame interval enumeration to CSI.

CSI can downscale the image independently horizontally and vertically by a
factor of two, which enumerates to four different frame sizes at the
output pads. The input pad supports a range of frame sizes.

CSI can also drop frames, resulting in frame rate reduction, so
enumerate the resulting possible output frame rates.
