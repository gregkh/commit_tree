NFC: fix broken device allocation

Commit 7eda8b8e9677 ("NFC: Use IDR library to assing NFC devices IDs")
moved device-id allocation and struct-device initialisation from
nfc_allocate_device() to nfc_register_device().

This broke just about every nfc-device-registration error path, which
continue to call nfc_free_device() that tries to put the device
reference of the now uninitialised (but zeroed) struct device:

kobject: '(null)' (ce316420): is not initialized, yet kobject_put() is being called.

The late struct-device initialisation also meant that various work
queues whose names are derived from the nfc device name were also
misnamed:

  421 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_cmd_]
  422 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_rx_w]
  423 root         0 SW<  [(null)_nci_tx_w]

Move the id-allocation and struct-device initialisation back to
nfc_allocate_device() and fix up the single call site which did not use
nfc_free_device() in its error path.
