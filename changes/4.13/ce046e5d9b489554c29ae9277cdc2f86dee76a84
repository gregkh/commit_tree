thermal: max77620: fix pinmux conflict on reprobe

Use the new helper for reusing a device-tree node of another device
instead of managing the node references explicitly.

This also makes sure that the new of_node_reuse flag is set if the
device is ever reprobed, something which specifically now avoids driver
core from attempting to claim any pinmux resources already claimed by
the parent device.
