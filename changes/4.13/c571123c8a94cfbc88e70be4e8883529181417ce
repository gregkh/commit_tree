pwm: Standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different format. Some
don't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard, using ReST
markup for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- mark document title;
- mark literal blocks;
- better format the parameters.
