ext4: avoid unnecessary stalls in ext4_evict_inode()

These days inode reclaim calls evict_inode() only when it has no pages
in the mapping.  In that case it is not necessary to wait for transaction
commit in ext4_evict_inode() as there can be no pages waiting to be
committed.  So avoid unnecessary transaction waiting in that case.

We still have to keep the check for the case where ext4_evict_inode()
gets called from other paths (e.g. umount) where inode still can have
some page cache pages.
