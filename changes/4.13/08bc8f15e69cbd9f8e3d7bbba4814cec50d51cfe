qed: Multiple qzone queues for VFs

This adds the infrastructure for supporting VFs that want to open
multiple transmission queues on the same queue-zone.
At this point, there are no VFs that actually request this functionality,
but later patches would remedy that.

 a. VF and PF would communicate the capability during ACQUIRE;
    Legacy VFs would continue on behaving as they do today

 b. PF would communicate number of supported CIDs to the VF
    and would enforce said limitation

 c. Whenever VF passes a request for a given queue configuration
    it would also pass an associated index within said queue-zone
