USB: ene_usb6250: fix first command execution

In the ene_usb6250 sub-driver for usb-storage, the ene_transport()
routine is supposed to initialize the driver before executing the
current command, if the initialization has not already been performed.
However, a bug in the routine causes it to skip the command after
doing the initialization.  Also, the routine does not return an
appropriate error code if either the initialization or the command
fails.

As a result of the first bug, the first command (a SCSI INQUIRY) is
not carried out.  The results can be seen in the system log, in the
form of a warning message and empty or garbage INQUIRY data:

Apr 18 22:40:08 notebook2 kernel: scsi host6: scsi scan: INQUIRY result too short (5), using 36
Apr 18 22:40:08 notebook2 kernel: scsi 6:0:0:0: Direct-Access                                    PQ: 0 ANSI: 0

This patch fixes both errors.
