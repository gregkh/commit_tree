drm/i915: Unify GT* and GT3 definitions

This patch clean up a bit the platform definition block in
a way to avoid duplications and to let clear that GT3 for
the current platform only have the extra Media engine (BSD2).

v2: Kabylake IS_KABYLAKE as Anusha noticed.

v3: Avoid EXTRA_ENGINE_MASK and list rings out on GT3 to
    make it more clear.
