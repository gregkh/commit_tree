arch/sparc: Introduce cmpxchg_u8 SPARC

SPARC supports 32 bit and 64 bit cmpxchg right now. Add support
for 8 bit (1 byte) cmpxchg. This is required to support queued
rwlocks feature  which uses 1 byte cmpxchg.

The function __cmpxchg_u8 here uses the 4 byte cas instruction with a
byte manipulation to achieve 1 byte cmpxchg.
