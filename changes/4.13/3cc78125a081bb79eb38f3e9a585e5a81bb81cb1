lib/test_bitmap.c: add optimisation tests

Patch series "Bitmap optimisations", v2.

These three bitmap patches use more efficient specialisations when the
compiler can figure out that it's safe to do so.  Thanks to Rasmus's
eagle eyes, a nasty bug in v1 was avoided, and I've added a test case
which would have caught it.

This patch (of 4):

This version of the test is actually a no-op; the next patch will enable
it.
