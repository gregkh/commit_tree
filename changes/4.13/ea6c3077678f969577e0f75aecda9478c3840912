dt-bindings: net: Remove duplicate NSP Ethernet MAC binding document

Commit 07d4510f5251 ("dt-bindings: net: bgmac: add bindings documentation for
bgmac") added both brcm,amac-nsp.txt and brcm,bgmac-nsp.txt. The former is
actually the one that got updated and is in use by the bgmac driver while the
latter is duplicating the former and is not used nor updated.
