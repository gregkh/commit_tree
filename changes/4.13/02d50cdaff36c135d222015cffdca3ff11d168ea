KVM: ARM64: fix phy counter access failure in guest.

When reading the cntpct_el0 in guest with VHE (Virtual Host Extension)
enabled in host, the "Unsupported guest sys_reg access" error reported.
The reason is cnthctl_el2.EL1PCTEN is not enabled, which is expected
to be done in kvm_timer_init_vhe(). The problem is kvm_timer_init_vhe
is called by cpu_init_hyp_mode, and which is called when VHE is disabled.
This patch remove the incorrect call to kvm_timer_init_vhe() from
cpu_init_hyp_mode(), and calls kvm_timer_init_vhe() to enable
cnthctl_el2.EL1PCTEN in cpu_hyp_reinit().

Fixes: 488f94d7212b ("KVM: arm64: Access CNTHCTL_EL2 bit fields correctly on VHE systems")
