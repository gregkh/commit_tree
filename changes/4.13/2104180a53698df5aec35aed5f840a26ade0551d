powerpc/64s: implement arch-specific hardlockup watchdog

Implement an arch-speicfic watchdog rather than use the perf-based
hardlockup detector.

The new watchdog takes the soft-NMI directly, rather than going through
perf.  Perf interrupts are to be made maskable in future, so that would
prevent the perf detector from working in those regions.

Additionally, implement a SMP based detector where all CPUs watch one
another by pinging a shared cpumask.  This is because powerpc Book3S
does not have a true periodic local NMI, but some platforms do implement
a true NMI IPI.

If a CPU is stuck with interrupts hard disabled, the soft-NMI watchdog
does not work, but the SMP watchdog will.  Even on platforms without a
true NMI IPI to get a good trace from the stuck CPU, other CPUs will
notice the lockup sufficiently to report it and panic.
