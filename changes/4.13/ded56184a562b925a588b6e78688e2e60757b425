btrfs: scrub: fix target device intialization while setting up scrub context

The commit "btrfs: scrub: inline helper scrub_setup_wr_ctx" inlined a
helper but wrongly sets up the target device. Incidentally there's a
local variable with the same name as a parameter in the previous
function, so this got caught during runtime as crash in test btrfs/027.
