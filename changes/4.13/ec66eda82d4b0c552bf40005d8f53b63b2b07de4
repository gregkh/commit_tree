tcp: introduce tcp_jiffies32

We abuse tcp_time_stamp for two different cases :

1) base to generate TCP Timestamp options (RFC 7323)

2) A 32bit version of jiffies since some TCP fields
   are 32bit wide to save memory.

Since we want in the future to have 1ms TCP TS clock,
regardless of HZ value, we want to cleanup things.

tcp_jiffies32 is the truncated jiffies value,
which will be used only in places where we want a 'host'
timestamp.
