pinctrl: bcm: clean up modular vs. non-modular distinctions

Fixups here tend to be more of a conglomerate of some of the other
repeated/systematic ones we've seen in the earlier pinctrl cleanups.

We remove module.h from code that isn't doing anything modular at
all;  if they have __init sections, then replace it with init.h

One driver has a .remove that would be dispatched on module_exit,
and as that code is essentially orphaned, so we remove it.  In case
anyone was previously doing the (pointless) unbind to get to that
function, we disable unbind for this one driver as well.

A couple bool drivers (hence non-modular) are converted over to
to builtin_platform_driver().

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
was (or is now) contained at the top of the file in the comments.
