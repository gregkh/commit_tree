ext4: make xattr inode reads faster

ext4_xattr_inode_read() currently reads each block sequentially while
waiting for io operation to complete before moving on to the next
block. This prevents request merging in block layer.

Add a ext4_bread_batch() function that starts reads for all blocks
then optionally waits for them to complete. A similar logic is used
in ext4_find_entry(), so update that code to use the new function.
