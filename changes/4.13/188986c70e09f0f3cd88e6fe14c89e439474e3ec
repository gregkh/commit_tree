mtd: nand: mtk: fix incorrect register setting order about ecc irq

Currently, we trigger ECC HW before setting ecc irq. It is incorrect.
Because ECC starts working once the register ECC_CTL_REG is set as
ECC_OP_ENABLE. And this may lead an abnormal behavior of ecc irq.
So, should enable ecc irq at first, then trigger ECC.
