KVM: s390: CMMA tracking, ESSA emulation, migration mode

* Add a migration state bitmap to keep track of which pages have dirty
  CMMA information.
* Disable CMMA by default, so we can track if it's used or not. Enable
  it on first use like we do for storage keys (unless we are doing a
  migration).
* Creates a VM attribute to enter and leave migration mode.
* In migration mode, CMMA is disabled in the SIE block, so ESSA is
  always interpreted and emulated in software.
* Free the migration state on VM destroy.
