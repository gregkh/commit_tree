drm/sun4i: tcon: Find matching display backend by device node matching

With Allwinner's Display Engine 1.0, each TCON's input is tied to a
specific display backend, and the 2 comprise what is known as a crtc
in DRM KMS land: The layer, framebuffer, and compositing functions are
provided by the backend, while the TCON provides the display timing
signals and vblank interrupts. This 1 to 1 relationship is represented
in the device tree. On some systems there is an intermediate DRC
component.

Pointers to both matching components must be provided when initializing
the crtc. As the backend is always registered before the associated
tcon, we can recursively search upwards through the of_graph to find
the matching backend.
