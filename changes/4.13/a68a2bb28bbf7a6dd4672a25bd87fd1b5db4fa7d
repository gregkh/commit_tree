rcu: Move docbook comments out of rcupdate.h

The include/linux/rcupdate.h file is included by more than 200
files, so shrinking it should provide some build-time benefits.
This commit therefore moves several docbook comments from rcupdate.h to
kernel/rcu/update.c, kernel/rcu/tree.c, and kernel/rcu/tree_plugin.h, thus
reducing the number of times that the compiler has to scan these comments.
This likely provides only a small benefit, but every little bit helps.

This commit also fixes a malformed bulleted list noted by the 0day
Test Robot.
