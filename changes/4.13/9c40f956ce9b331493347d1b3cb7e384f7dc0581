Revert "ACPI / EC: Enable event freeze mode..." to fix a regression

On Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon - the 5th Generation, enabling an earlier
EC event freezing timing causes acpitz-virtual-0 to report a stuck
48C temparature.  And with EC firmware revisioned as 1.14, without
reverting back to old EC event freezing timing, the fan still blows
up after a system resume.

This reverts the culprit change so that the regression can be fixed
without upgrading the EC firmware.
