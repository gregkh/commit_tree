iio: hi8435: avoid garbage event at first enable

Currently, driver generates events for channels if new reading differs
from previous one. This "previous value" is initialized to zero, which
results into event if value is constant-one.

Fix that by initializing "previous value" by reading at event enable
time.

This provides reliable sequence for userspace:
- enable event,
- AFTER THAT read current value,
- AFTER THAT each event will correspond to change.
