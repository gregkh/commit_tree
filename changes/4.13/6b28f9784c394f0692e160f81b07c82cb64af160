iwlwifi: mvm: fix the recovery flow while connecting

In BSS mode in the disconnection flow, mac80211 removes
the AP station before the vif is set to unassociated.
Our firmware wants it the other way around: first set
the vif as unassociated, and then remove the AP station.

In order to bridge between those two different behaviors,
iwlmvm doesn't remove the station from the firmware when
mac80211 removes it, but only after the vif is set to
unassociated. The implementation is in
iwl_mvm_bss_info_changed_station:

if (assoc state was modified && mvmvif->ap_sta_id is VALID
    && assoc state is now UNASSC)
	remove_the_station_from_the_firmware()

During the recovery flow, mac80211 re-adds the AP station
and then reconfigures the vif. Since the vif is not
associated, and then, we enter the if above (which was
intended to be taken in the disconnection flow only) and
remove the station we just added. This defeats the
recovery flow.

Fix this by not removing the AP station in this flow if
we are in recovery flow.
