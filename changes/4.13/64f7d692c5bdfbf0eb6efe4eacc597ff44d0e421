MAINTAINERS: Update MAX77802 PMIC entry

The Samsung email address will stop working soon, so use my personal
email address instead.

Also, there used to be a MFD and RTC drivers for max77802 but now these
have been merged with the max77686 MFD and RTC drivers. The only driver
that's still max77802 specific is the regulator one since there are too
many differences with max77686 there to justify merging the two drivers.
