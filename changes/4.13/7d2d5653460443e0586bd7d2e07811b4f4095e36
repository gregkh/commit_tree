xfs: separate shutdown from ticket reservation print helper

xlog_print_tic_res() pre-dates delayed logging and the committed
items list (CIL) and thus retains some factoring warts, such as hard
coded function names in the output and the fact that it induces a
shutdown.

In preparation for more detailed logging of regular transaction
overrun situations, refactor xlog_print_tic_res() to be slightly
more generic. Reword some of the warning messages and pull the
shutdown into the callers.
