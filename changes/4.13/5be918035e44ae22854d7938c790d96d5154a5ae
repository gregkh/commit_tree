HID: move Asus keyboard support from hid-chicony to hid-asus

The Asus AIO keyboard AK1D was added to hid-chicony based on its
USB vendor ID, however images available online suggest that this keyboard
is physically branded as ASUS with no mention of Chicony.

A recent commit also added support for another Asus AIO keyboard into
hid-chicony, this one with USB vendor ID Jess, and a pending review
comment asked me to move it into hid-asus because it is also only
physically branded as ASUS.

I updated the USB ID defines to match the branding and product name,
including noting that the recently added keyboard is labelled as
ASUS MD-5112.
