net: macb: Add hardware PTP support

This patch is based on original Harini's patch and Andrei's patch,
implemented in a separate file to ease the review/maintanance
and integration with other platforms.

This driver supports GEM-GXL:
- Register ptp clock framework
- Initialize PTP related registers
- HW time stamp on the PTP Ethernet packets are received using the
  SO_TIMESTAMPING API. Time stamps are obtained from the dma buffer
  descriptors
- add macb_ptp to compilation chain
