powerpc: Link warning for orphan sections

Add --orphan-handling=warn to final link flags. This ensures we can
handle all sections explicitly. This would have caught subtle breakage
such as 7de3b27bac47da9de08409df1d69664acbb72197 at build-time.

Also bring existing orphan sections into the fold:
- .text.hot and .text.unlikely are compiler generated sections.
- .sdata2, .dynsbss, .plt are used by PPC32
- We previously did not specify DWARF_DEBUG or STABS_DEBUG
- DWARF_DEBUG did not include all DWARF sections that can be emitted
- A number of sections are unused and can be discarded.
