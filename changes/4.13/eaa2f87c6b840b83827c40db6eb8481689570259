x86/ldt: Fix off by one in get_segment_base()

ldt->entries[] is allocated in alloc_ldt_struct().  It has
ldt->nr_entries elements and ldt->nr_entries is capped at LDT_ENTRIES.
So if "idx" is == ldt->nr_entries then we're reading beyond the end of
the buffer.  It seems duplicative to have two limit checks when one
would work just as well so I removed the check against LDT_ENTRIES.

The gdt_page.gdt[] array has GDT_ENTRIES entries.
