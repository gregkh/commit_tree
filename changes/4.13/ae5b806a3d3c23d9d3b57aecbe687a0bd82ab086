ceph: ensure RNG is seeded before using

Ceph uses the RNG for various nonce generations, and it shouldn't accept
using bad randomness. So, we wait for the RNG to be properly seeded. We
do this by calling wait_for_random_bytes() in a function that is
certainly called in process context, early on, so that all subsequent
calls to get_random_bytes are necessarily acceptable.
