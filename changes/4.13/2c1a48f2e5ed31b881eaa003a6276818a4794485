KVM: S390: add new group for flic

In some cases, userspace needs to get or set all ais states for example
migration. So we introduce a new group KVM_DEV_FLIC_AISM_ALL to provide
interfaces to get or set the adapter-interruption-suppression mode for
all ISCs. The corresponding documentation is updated.
