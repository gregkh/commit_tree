EDAC, i5000, i5400: Fix definition of NRECMEMB register

In the i5000 and i5400 drivers, the NRECMEMB register is defined as a
16-bit value, which results in wrong shifts in the code, as reported by
sparse.

In the datasheets ([1], section 3.9.22.20 and [2], section 3.9.22.21),
this register is a 32-bit register. A u32 value for the register fixes
the wrong shifts warnings and matches the datasheet.

Also fix the mask to access to the CAS bits [27:16] in the i5000 driver.
