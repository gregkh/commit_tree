lib/rhashtable.c: use kvzalloc() in bucket_table_alloc() when possible

bucket_table_alloc() can be currently called with GFP_KERNEL or
GFP_ATOMIC.  For the former we basically have an open coded kvzalloc()
while the later only uses kzalloc().  Let's simplify the code a bit by
the dropping the open coded path and replace it with kvzalloc().
