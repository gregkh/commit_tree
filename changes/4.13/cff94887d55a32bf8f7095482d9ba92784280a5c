ARM: dts: add core I2C devices to the APQ8060 Dragonboard

The APQ8060 Dragonboard has an Atmel AT24c128 EEPROM and a
Wolfson Micro WM8903 codec connected to its GSBI8 I2C bus.
Add entries for these to the device tree. The interrupt line
from the WM8903 chip is not routed anywhere on this design
so it can not be used.
