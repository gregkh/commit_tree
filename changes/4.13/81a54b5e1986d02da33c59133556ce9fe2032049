thunderbolt: Let the connection manager handle all notifications

Currently the control channel (ctl.c) handles the one supported
notification (PLUG_EVENT) and sends back ACK accordingly. However, we
are going to add support for the internal connection manager (ICM) that
needs to handle a different notifications. So instead of dealing
everything in the control channel, we change the callback to take an
arbitrary thunderbolt packet and convert the native connection manager
to handle the event itself.

In addition we only push replies we know of to the response FIFO.
Everything else is treated as notification (or request) and is expected
to be dealt by the connection manager implementation.
