MIPS: SEAD-3: Fix GIC interrupt specifiers

The various interrupt specifiers in the device tree are not in a valid
format for the MIPS GIC interrupt controller binding. Where each
interrupt should provide 3 values - GIC_LOCAL or GIC_SHARED, the
pin number & the type of interrupt - the device tree was only providing
the pin number. This causes interrupts for those devices to not be used
when a GIC is present. SEAD-3 systems without a GIC are unaffected since
the DT fixup code generates interrupt specifiers that are valid for the
CPU interrupt controller.

Fix this by adding the GIC_SHARED & IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH values to each
interrupt specifier.
