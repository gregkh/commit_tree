Btrfs: fix unexpected return value of bio_readpage_error

With blk_status_t conversion (that are now present in master),
bio_readpage_error() may return 1 as now ->submit_bio_hook() may not set
%ret if it runs without problems.

This fixes that unexpected return value by changing
btrfs_check_repairable() to return a bool instead of updating %ret, and
patch is applicable to both codebases with and without blk_status_t.
