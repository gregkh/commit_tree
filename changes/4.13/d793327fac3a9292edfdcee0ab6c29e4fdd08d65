dmaengine: mv_xor_v2: implement proper interrupt coalescing

Until now, the driver was not using interrupt coalescing: one interrupt
was generated for each descriptor processed by the XOR engine. This
commit changes that by using the interrupt coalescing features of the
hardware, by setting both a number of descriptors processed before an
interrupt is generated and a timeout before an interrupt is generated.
