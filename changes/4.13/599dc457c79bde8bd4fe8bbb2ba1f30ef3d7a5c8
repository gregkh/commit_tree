clocksource/drivers/Kconfig: Fix CLKSRC_PISTACHIO dependencies

In v4.13, CLKSRC_PISTACHIO can select TIMER_OF on architectures without
GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS, resulting in a struct clock_event_device missing
some required features and build breakage compiling timer_of.c. One of
the symbols selecting TIMER_OF is CLKSRC_PISTACHIO, so add the
dependency on GENERIC_CLOCKEVENTS.

Thanks to kbuild test robot for finding this error
