brcmfmac: switch to using cfg80211_connect_done()

The driver used cfg80211_connect_result() which is basically a wrapper
around cfg80211_connect_done() passing a subset of the information that
can be passed. For upcoming functionality this is not sufficient so
switching to use cfg80211_connect_done().
