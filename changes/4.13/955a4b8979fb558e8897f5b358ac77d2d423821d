drm/i915: Don't force serialisation on marking up execlists irq posted

Since we coordinate with the execlists tasklet using a locked schedule
operation that ensures that after we set the engine->irq_posted we
always have an invocation of the tasklet, we do not need to use a locked
operation to set the engine->irq_posted itself.
