qed*: LL2 callback operations

LL2 today is interrupt driven - when tx/rx completion arrives [or any
other indication], qed needs to operate on the connection and pass
the information to the protocol-driver [or internal qed consumer].
Since we have several flavors of ll2 employeed by the driver,
each handler needs to do an if-else to determine the right functionality
to use based on the connection type.

In order to make things more scalable [given that we're going to add
additional types of ll2 flavors] move the infrastrucutre into using
a callback-based approach - the callbacks would be provided as part
of the connection's initialization parameters.
