workqueue: implicit ordered attribute should be overridable

5c0338c68706 ("workqueue: restore WQ_UNBOUND/max_active==1 to be
ordered") automatically enabled ordered attribute for unbound
workqueues w/ max_active == 1.  Because ordered workqueues reject
max_active and some attribute changes, this implicit ordered mode
broke cases where the user creates an unbound workqueue w/ max_active
== 1 and later explicitly changes the related attributes.

This patch distinguishes explicit and implicit ordered setting and
overrides from attribute changes if implict.
