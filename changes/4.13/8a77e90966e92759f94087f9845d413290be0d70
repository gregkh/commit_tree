KVM: SVM: Prepare for new bit definition in lbr_ctl

The lbr_ctl variable in the vmcb control area is used to enable or
disable Last Branch Record (LBR) virtualization. However, this is to be
done using only bit 0 of the variable. To correct this and to prepare
for a new feature, change the current usage to work only on a particular
bit.
