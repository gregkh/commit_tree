ARM: dts: imx6qdl-wandboard: Fix audio channel swap

When running a stress playback/stop loop test on a mx6wandboard channel
swaps can be noticed randomly.

Increasing the SGTL5000 LRCLK pad strength to its maximum value fixes
the issue, so add the 'lrclk-strength' property to avoid the audio
channel swaps.
