tty: cyclades: drop broken alt-speed support

Setting an alt_speed using the ASYNC_SPD flags has been deprecated since
v2.1.69, and has been broken since v3.10 and commit 6865ff222cca ("TTY:
do not warn about setting speed via SPD_*") without anyone noticing.

Drop the broken alt-speed handling altogether, and add a ratelimited
warning about using TIOCCSERIAL to to change speed as being deprecated.

Note that using ASYNC_SPD_CUST is still supported.
