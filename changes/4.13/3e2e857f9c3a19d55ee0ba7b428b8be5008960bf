module: Add module name to modinfo

Accessing the mod structure (e.g. for mod->name) prior to having completed
check_modstruct_version() can result in writing garbage to the error logs
if the layout of the mod structure loaded from disk doesn't match the
running kernel's mod structure layout. This kind of mismatch will become
much more likely if a kernel is built with different randomization seed
for the struct layout randomization plugin.

Instead, add and use a new modinfo string for logging the module name.
