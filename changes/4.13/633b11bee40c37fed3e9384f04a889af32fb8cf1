cgroup-v2.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- Comment the internal index;
- Use :Date: and :Author: for authorship;
- Mark titles;
- Mark literal blocks;
- Adjust witespaces;
- Mark notes;
- Use table notation for the existing tables.
