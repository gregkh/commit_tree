ACPI / EC: Drop EC noirq hooks to fix a regression

According to bug reports, although the busy polling mode can make
noirq stages execute faster, it causes abnormal fan blowing up after
system resume (see the first link below for a video demonstration)
on Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon - the 5th Generation.  The problem can
be fixed by upgrading the EC firmware on that machine.

However, many reporters confirm that the problem can be fixed by
stopping busy polling during suspend/resume and for some of them
upgrading the EC firmware is not an option.

For this reason, drop the noirq stage hooks from the EC driver
to fix the regression.
