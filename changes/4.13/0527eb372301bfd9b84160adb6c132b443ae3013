pwm: tegra: Set maximum pwm clock source per SoC tapeout

The PWM hardware IP is taped-out with different maximum frequency
on different SoCs.

From HW team:

	Before Tegra186, it is 48 MHz.
	In Tegra186, it is 102 MHz.

Add support to limit the clock source frequency to the maximum IP
supported frequency. Provide these values via SoC chipdata.
