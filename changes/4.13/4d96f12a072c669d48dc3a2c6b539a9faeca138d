ibmvnic: Initialize SCRQ's during login renegotiation

SCRQ resources are freed during renegotiation, but they are not
re-allocated afterwards due to some changes in the initialization
process. Fix that by re-allocating the memory after renegotation.

SCRQ's can also be freed if a server capabilities request fails.
If this were encountered during a device reset for example,
SCRQ's may not be re-allocated. This operation is not necessary
anymore so remove it.
