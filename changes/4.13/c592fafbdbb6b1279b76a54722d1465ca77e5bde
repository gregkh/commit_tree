thermal: max77620: fix device-node reference imbalance

The thermal child device reuses the parent MFD-device device-tree node
when registering a thermal zone, but did not take a reference to the
node.

This leads to a reference imbalance, and potential use-after-free, when
the node reference is dropped by the platform-bus device destructor
(once for the child and later again for the parent).

Fix this by dropping any reference already held to a device-tree node
and getting a reference to the parent's node which will be balanced on
reprobe or on platform-device release, whichever comes first.

Note that simply clearing the of_node pointer on probe errors and on
driver unbind would not allow the use of device-managed resources as
specifically thermal_zone_of_sensor_unregister() claims that a valid
device-tree node pointer is needed during deregistration (even if it
currently does not seem to use it).
