drm: rcar-du: Register a completion callback with VSP1

Currently we process page flip events on every display interrupt,
however this does not take into consideration the processing time needed
by the VSP1 utilised in the pipeline.

Register a callback with the VSP driver to obtain completion events, and
track them so that we only perform page flips when the full display
pipeline has completed for the frame.
