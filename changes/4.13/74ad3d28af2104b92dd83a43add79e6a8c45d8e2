parisc: Define CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN

While working on enabling queued rwlock on SPARC, found this following
code in include/asm-generic/qrwlock.h which uses CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN
to clear a byte.

static inline u8 *__qrwlock_write_byte(struct qrwlock *lock)
 {
	return (u8 *)lock + 3 * IS_BUILTIN(CONFIG_CPU_BIG_ENDIAN);
 }

Problem is many of the fixed big endian architectures don't define
CPU_BIG_ENDIAN and clears the wrong byte.

Define CPU_BIG_ENDIAN for parisc architecture to fix it.
