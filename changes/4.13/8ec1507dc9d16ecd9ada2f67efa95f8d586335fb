net: sched: select cls when cls_act is enabled

It really makes no sense to have cls_act enabled without cls. In that
case, the cls_act code is dead. So select it.

This also fixes an issue recently reported by kbuild robot:
[linux-next:master 1326/4151] net/sched/act_api.c:37:18: error: implicit declaration of function 'tcf_chain_get'
