ALSA: pcm: include pcm_local.h and remove some extraneous tabs

We need to include pcm_local.h to clean up some smatch warnings:

symbol 'snd_pcm_timer_done' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'snd_pcm_timer_init' was not declared. Should it be static?
symbol 'snd_pcm_timer_resolution_change' was not declared. Should
  it be static?

Also remove some extraneous tabs on empty lines and replace space
intentation with a tab.
