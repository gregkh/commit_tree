s390/qeth: use diag26c to get MAC address on L2

When a s390 guest runs on a z/VM host that's part of a SSI cluster,
it can be migrated to a different host. In this case, the MAC address
it originally obtained on the old host may be re-assigned to a new
guest. This would result in address conflicts between the two guests.

When running as z/VM guest, use the diag26c MAC Service to obtain
a hypervisor-managed MAC address. The MAC Service is SSI-aware, and
won't re-assign the address after the guest is migrated to a new host.

This patch adds support for the z/VM MAC Service on L2 devices.
