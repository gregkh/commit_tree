drm/i915/cnl: Cannonlake has same MOCS table than Skylake.

All registers and default configuration are the same for Skylake
and Cannonlake.

v2: Don't apply Wa for platforms without MOCS. (Paulo)

v3: Removed WaDisableSkipCaching that Joonas noticed that
according to spec it is not applicable to CNL.
