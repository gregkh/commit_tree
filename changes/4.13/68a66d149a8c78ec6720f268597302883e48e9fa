net_sched: fix order of queue length updates in qdisc_replace()

This important to call qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() after changing queue
length. Parent qdisc should deactivate class in ->qlen_notify() called from
qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog() but this happens only if qdisc->q.qlen in zero.

Missed class deactivations leads to crashes/warnings at picking packets
from empty qdisc and corrupting state at reactivating this class in future.
