ras: acpi / apei: generate trace event for unrecognized CPER section

The UEFI spec includes non-standard section type support in the
Common Platform Error Record. This is defined in section N.2.3 of
UEFI version 2.5.

Currently if the CPER section's type (UUID) does not match any
section type that the kernel knows how to parse, a trace event is
not generated.

Generate a trace event which contains the raw error data for
non-standard section type error records.
