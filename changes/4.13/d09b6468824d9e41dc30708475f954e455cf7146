mm: document highmem_is_dirtyable sysctl

It seems that there are still people using 32b kernels which a lot of
memory and the IO tend to suck a lot for them by default.  Mostly
because writers are throttled too when the lowmem is used.  We have
highmem_is_dirtyable to work around that issue but it seems we never
bothered to document it.  Let's do it now, finally.
