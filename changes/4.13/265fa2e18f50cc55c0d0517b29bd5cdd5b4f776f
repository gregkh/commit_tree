drm/i915: Remove hdmi_connected from LPE audio pdata

We can determine that the pipe was shut down from pipe<0, so there's
no point in duplicating that information as 'hdmi_connected'.

v2: Use pipe<0 instead of port<0 as we'll want to do per-port
    PCM devices later
    Initialize pipe to -1 to inidicate inactive initial state
