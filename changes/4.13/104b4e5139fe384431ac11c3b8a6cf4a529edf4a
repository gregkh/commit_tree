percpu_counter: Rename __percpu_counter_add to percpu_counter_add_batch

Currently, percpu_counter_add is a wrapper around __percpu_counter_add
which is preempt safe due to explicit calls to preempt_disable.  Given
how __ prefix is used in percpu related interfaces, the naming
unfortunately creates the false sense that __percpu_counter_add is
less safe than percpu_counter_add.  In terms of context-safety,
they're equivalent.  The only difference is that the __ version takes
a batch parameter.

Make this a bit more explicit by just renaming __percpu_counter_add to
percpu_counter_add_batch.

This patch doesn't cause any functional changes.

tj: Minor updates to patch description for clarity.  Cosmetic
    indentation updates.
