dm: introduce dm_remap_zone_report()

A target driver support zoned block devices and exposing it as such may
receive REQ_OP_ZONE_REPORT request for the user to determine the mapped
device zone configuration. To process properly such request, the target
driver may need to remap the zone descriptors provided in the report
reply. The helper function dm_remap_zone_report() does this generically
using only the target start offset and length and the start offset
within the target device.

dm_remap_zone_report() will remap the start sector of all zones
reported. If the report includes sequential zones, the write pointer
position of these zones will also be remapped.
