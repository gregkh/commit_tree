dmaengine: qcom_hidma: correct API violation for submit

Current code is violating the DMA Engine API by putting the submitted
requests directly into the HW queue. This causes queued transactions
to be started by another thread as soon as the first one finishes.

The DMA Engine document clearly states this.

"dmaengine_submit() will not start the DMA operation".

Move HW queuing of the requests into the issue_pending() routine
to comply with API requirements also create a new queued state for
temporarily holding the requests.

A descriptor goes through these transitions now.

free->prepared->queued->active->completed->free

as opposed to

free->prepared->active->completed->free
