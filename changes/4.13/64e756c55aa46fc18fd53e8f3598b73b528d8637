powerpc: Fix emulation of mfocrf in emulate_step()

From POWER4 onwards, mfocrf() only places the specified CR field into
the destination GPR, and the rest of it is set to 0. The PowerPC AS
from version 3.0 now requires this behaviour.

The emulation code currently puts the entire CR into the destination GPR.
Fix it.
