drm/sun4i: add support for Allwinner DE2 mixers

Allwinner have a new "Display Engine 2.0" in their new SoCs, which comes
with mixers to do graphic processing and feed data to TCON, like the old
backends and frontends.

Add support for the mixer on Allwinner V3s SoC; it's the simplest one.

Currently a lot of functions are still missing -- more investigations
are needed to gain enough information for them.
