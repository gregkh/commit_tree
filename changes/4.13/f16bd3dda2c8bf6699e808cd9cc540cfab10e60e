drm/i915/gvt: Fix inconsistent locks holding sequence

There are two kinds of locking sequence.

One is in the thread which is started by vfio ioctl to do
the iommu unmapping. The locking sequence is:
	down_read(&group_lock) ----> mutex_lock(&cached_lock)

The other is in the vfio release thread which will unpin all
the cached pages. The lock sequence is:
	mutex_lock(&cached_lock) ---> down_read(&group_lock)

And, the cache_lock is used to protect the rb tree of the cache
node and doing vfio unpin doesn't require this lock. Move the
vfio unpin out of the cache_lock protected region.

v2:
- use for style instead of do{}while(1). (Zhenyu)
