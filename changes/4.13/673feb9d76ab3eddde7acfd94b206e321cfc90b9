ftrace: Add :mod: caching infrastructure to trace_array

This is the start of the infrastructure work to allow for tracing module
functions before it is loaded.

Currently the following command:

  # echo :mod:some-mod > set_ftrace_filter

will enable tracing of all functions within the module "some-mod" if it is
loaded. What we want, is if the module is not loaded, that line will be
saved. When the module is loaded, then the "some-mod" will have that line
executed on it, so that the functions within it starts being traced.
