KVM: x86: remove ignored type attribute

The macro insn_fetch marks the 'type' argument as having a specified
alignment.  Type attributes can only be applied to structs, unions, or
enums, but insn_fetch is only ever invoked with integral types, so Clang
produces 19 -Wignored-attributes warnings for this source file.
