powerpc/[booke|4xx]: Don't clobber TCR[WP] when setting TCR[DIE]

Prevent a kernel panic caused by unintentionally clearing TCR watchdog
bits. At this point in the kernel boot, the watchdog may have already
been enabled by u-boot. The original code's attempt to write to the TCR
register results in an inadvertent clearing of the watchdog
configuration bits, causing the 476 to reset.
