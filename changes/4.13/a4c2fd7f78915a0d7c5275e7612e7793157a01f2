net: remove DST_NOCACHE flag

DST_NOCACHE flag check has been removed from dst_release() and
dst_hold_safe() in a previous patch because all the dst are now ref
counted properly and can be released based on refcnt only.
Looking at the rest of the DST_NOCACHE use, all of them can now be
removed or replaced with other checks.
So this patch gets rid of all the DST_NOCACHE usage and remove this flag
completely.
