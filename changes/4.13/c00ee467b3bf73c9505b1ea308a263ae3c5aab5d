iwlwifi: pcie: work around suspend/resume issue

In some platforms, having the device enabled with certain radio
frontends causes the platform to not be able to resume properly
from suspend, regardless of the wakeup cause. This was traced to
a hardware issue with the integrated 9000-series A-step variant.
Set the right hardware bit to disable the problematic state.
