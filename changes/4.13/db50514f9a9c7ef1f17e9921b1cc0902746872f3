net: sched: add termination action to allow goto chain

Introduce new type of termination action called "goto_chain". This allows
user to specify a chain to be processed. This action type is
then processed as a return value in tcf_classify loop in similar
way as "reclassify" is, only it does not reset to the first filter
in chain but rather reset to the first filter of the desired chain.
