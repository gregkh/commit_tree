drm/amdgpu: guarantee bijective mapping of ring ids for LRU v3

Depending on usage patterns, the current LRU policy may create a
non-injective mapping between userspace ring ids and kernel rings.

This behaviour is undesired as apps that attempt to fill all HW blocks
would be unable to reach some of them.

This change forces the LRU policy to create bijective mappings only.

v2: compress ring_blacklist
v3: simplify amdgpu_ring_is_blacklisted() logic
