arm64: fix endianness annotation in call_undef_hook()

Here we're reading thumb or ARM instructions, which are always
stored in memory in little-endian order. These values are thus
correctly converted to native order but the intermediate value
should be annotated as for little-endian values.

Fix this by declaring the intermediate var as __le32 or __le16.
