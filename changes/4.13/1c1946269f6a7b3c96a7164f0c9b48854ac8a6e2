platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: do not update ACPI device power status

Calling acpi_bus_update_power() for ACPI devices FUJ02B1 and FUJ02E3 is
pointless as they are not power manageable (neither _PS0 nor _PR0 is
defined for any of them), which causes their power state to be inherited
from their parent devices.  Given the ACPI paths of these two devices
(\_SB.PCI0.LPCB.FJEX, \_SB.FEXT), their parent devices are also not
power manageable.  These parent devices will thus have their power state
initialized to ACPI_STATE_D0, which in turn causes the power state for
both FUJ02B1 and FUJ02E3 to always be ACPI_STATE_D0 ("on").

Remove relevant acpi_bus_update_power() calls along with parts of debug
messages that they were supposed to have an effect on.
