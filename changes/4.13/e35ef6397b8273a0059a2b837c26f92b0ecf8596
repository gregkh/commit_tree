mm/cma.c: warn if the CMA area could not be activated

While activating a CMA area we check to make sure that all the PFNs in
the range are inside the same zone.  This is a requirement for
alloc_contig_range() to work.  Any CMA area failing the check is
disabled for good.  This happens silently right now making all future
cma_alloc() allocations failure inevitable.

Here we add an error message stating that the CMA area could not be
activated which makes it easier to explain any future cma_alloc()
failures on it.  While in there, change the bail out goto label from
'err' to 'not_in_zone' which makes more sense.
