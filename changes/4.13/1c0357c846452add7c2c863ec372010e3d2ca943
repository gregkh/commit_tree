test_sysctl: test against PAGE_SIZE for int

Add the following tests to ensure we do not regress:

  o Test using a buffer full of space (PAGE_SIZE-1) followed by a
    single digit works

  o Test using a buffer full of spaces (PAGE_SIZE or over) will fail

As tests increase instead of unloading the module and reloading it we
can just do a shell reset_vals() with a reset to values we know are set
at init on the driver.
