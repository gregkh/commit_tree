kernel/watchdog: split up config options

Split SOFTLOCKUP_DETECTOR from LOCKUP_DETECTOR, and split
HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF from HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR.

LOCKUP_DETECTOR implies the general boot, sysctl, and programming
interfaces for the lockup detectors.

An architecture that wants to use a hard lockup detector must define
HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_PERF or HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH.

Alternatively an arch can define HAVE_NMI_WATCHDOG, which provides the
minimum arch_touch_nmi_watchdog, and it otherwise does its own thing and
does not implement the LOCKUP_DETECTOR interfaces.

sparc is unusual in that it has started to implement some of the
interfaces, but not fully yet.  It should probably be converted to a full
HAVE_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_ARCH.
