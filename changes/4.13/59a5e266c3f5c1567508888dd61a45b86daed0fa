libata: array underflow in ata_find_dev()

My static checker complains that "devno" can be negative, meaning that
we read before the start of the loop.  I've looked at the code, and I
think the warning is right.  This come from /proc so it's root only or
it would be quite a quite a serious bug.  The call tree looks like this:

proc_scsi_write() <- gets id and channel from simple_strtoul()
-> scsi_add_single_device() <- calls shost->transportt->user_scan()
   -> ata_scsi_user_scan()
      -> ata_find_dev()
