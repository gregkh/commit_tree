iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Enable ACPI based HiSilicon CMD_PREFETCH quirk(erratum 161010701)

HiSilicon SMMUv3 on Hip06/Hip07 platforms doesn't support CMD_PREFETCH
command. The dt based support for this quirk is already present in the
driver(hisilicon,broken-prefetch-cmd). This adds ACPI support for the
quirk using the IORT smmu model number.
