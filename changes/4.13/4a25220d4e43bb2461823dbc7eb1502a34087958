hugetlbfs: Implement show_options

Implement the show_options superblock op for hugetlbfs as part of a bid to
get rid of s_options and generic_show_options() to make it easier to
implement a context-based mount where the mount options can be passed
individually over a file descriptor.

Note that the uid and gid should possibly be displayed relative to the
viewer's user namespace.
