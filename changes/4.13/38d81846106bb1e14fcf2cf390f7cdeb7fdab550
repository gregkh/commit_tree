powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Fix return value of hcalls

The H_GET_24X7_CATALOG_PAGE hcall can return a signed error code, so fix
this in the code.

The H_GET_24X7_DATA hcall can return a signed error code, so fix this in
the code. Also, don't truncate it to 32 bit to use as return value for
make_24x7_request. In case of error h_24x7_event_commit_txn passes that
return value to generic code, so it should be a proper errno. The other
caller of make_24x7_request is single_24x7_request, whose callers don't
actually care which error code is returned so they are not affected by this
change.

Finally, h_24x7_get_value doesn't use the error code from
single_24x7_request, so there's no need to store it.
