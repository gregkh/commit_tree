drm/amdgpu: fix missed gpu info firmware when cache firmware during S3

gpu_info firmware is released after data is used. But when system enters into
suspend, upper class driver will cache all firmware names. At that time,
gpu_info will be failing to load. It seems an upper class issue, that we should
not release gpu_info firmware until device finished.
