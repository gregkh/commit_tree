netvsc: Initialize 64-bit stats seqcount

On 32-bit hosts and with CONFIG_DEBUG_LOCK_ALLOC we should be seeing a
lockdep splat indicating this seqcount is not correctly initialized, fix
that. In commit 6c80f3fc2398 ("netvsc: report per-channel stats in
ethtool statistics") netdev_alloc_pcpu_stats() was removed in favor of
open-coding the 64-bits statistics, except that u64_stats_init() was
missed.
