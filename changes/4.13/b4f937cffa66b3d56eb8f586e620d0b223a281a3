NFS: Don't run wake_up_bit() when nobody is waiting...

"perf lock" shows fairly heavy contention for the bit waitqueue locks
when doing an I/O heavy workload.
Use a bit to tell whether or not there has been contention for a lock
so that we can optimise away the bit waitqueue options in those cases.
