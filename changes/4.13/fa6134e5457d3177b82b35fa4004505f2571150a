mtd: nand: denali: switch over to cmd_ctrl instead of cmdfunc

The NAND_CMD_SET_FEATURES support is missing from denali_cmdfunc().
We also see /* TODO: Read OOB data */ comment.

It would be possible to add more commands along with the current
implementation, but having ->cmd_ctrl() seems a better approach from
the discussion with Boris [1].

Rely on the default ->cmdfunc() from the framework and implement the
driver's own ->cmd_ctrl().

This transition also fixes NAND_CMD_STATUS and NAND_CMD_PARAM handling.
NAND_CMD_STATUS was just faked by the register read, so the only valid
bit was the WP bit.  NAND_CMD_PARAM was completely broken; not only the
command sent on the bus was NAND_CMD_STATUS instead of NAND_CMD_PARAM,
but also the driver was only reading 8 bytes, while the parameter page
contains several hundreds of bytes.

Also add ->write_byte(), which is needed for write direction commands,
->read/write_buf(16), which will be used some commits later.
->read_word() is not used for now, but the core may call it in the
future.

Now, this driver can drop nand_onfi_get_set_features_notsupp().
