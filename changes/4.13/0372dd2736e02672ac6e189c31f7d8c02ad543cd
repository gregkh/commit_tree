sched/topology: Fix building of overlapping sched-groups

When building the overlapping groups, we very obviously should start
with the previous domain of _this_ @cpu, not CPU-0.

This can be readily demonstrated with a topology like:

  node   0   1   2   3
    0:  10  20  30  20
    1:  20  10  20  30
    2:  30  20  10  20
    3:  20  30  20  10

Where (for example) CPU1 ends up generating the following nonsensical groups:

  [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
  []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
  []   groups: 1 2 0
  []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
  []    groups: 1-3 (cpu_capacity = 3072) 0-1,3 (cpu_capacity = 3072)

Where the fact that domain 1 doesn't include a group with span 0-2 is
the obvious fail.

With patch this looks like:

  [] CPU1 attaching sched-domain:
  []  domain 0: span 0-2 level NUMA
  []   groups: 1 0 2
  []   domain 1: span 0-3 level NUMA
  []    groups: 0-2 (cpu_capacity = 3072) 0,2-3 (cpu_capacity = 3072)
