net/mlx4_en: Fix wrong indication of Wake-on-LAN (WoL) support

Currently when WoL is supported but disabled, ethtool reports:
"Supports Wake-on: d".
Fix the indication of Wol support, so that the indication
remains "g" all the time if the NIC supports WoL.

Tested:
As accepted, when NIC supports WoL- ethtool reports:
	Supports Wake-on: g
	Wake-on: d
when NIC doesn't support WoL- ethtool reports:
        Supports Wake-on: d
        Wake-on: d
