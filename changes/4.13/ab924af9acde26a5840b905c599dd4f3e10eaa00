[media] media: i2c: ov772x: Force use of SCCB protocol

Commit e78902976150 ("i2c: sh_mobile: don't send a stop condition by
default inside transfers") makes the i2c_sh_mobile I2C-adapter emit a
stop/start sequence between messages in a single transfer only when
explicitly requested with I2C_M_STOP.

This breaks the ov772x driver in the SH4 Migo-R board as the Omnivision
sensor uses the I2C-like SCCB protocol that doesn't support repeated
starts:

i2c-sh_mobile i2c-sh_mobile.0: Transfer request timed out
ov772x 0-0021: Product ID error 92:92

Fix it by marking the client as SCCB, forcing the emission of a
stop/start sequence between all messages.
As I2C_M_STOP requires the I2C adapter to support protocol mangling,
ensure that the I2C_FUNC_PROTOCOL_MANGLING functionality is available.

Tested on SH4 Migo-R board, with OV772x now successfully probing
