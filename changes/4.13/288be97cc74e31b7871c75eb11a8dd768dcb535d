arm64/lib: copy_page: use consistent prefetch stride

The optional prefetch instructions in the copy_page() routine are
inconsistent: at the start of the function, two cachelines are
prefetched beyond the one being loaded in the first iteration, but
in the loop, the prefetch is one more line ahead. This appears to
be unintentional, so let's fix it.

While at it, fix the comment style and white space.
