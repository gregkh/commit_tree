xfs: rewrite xfs_dq_get_next_id using xfs_iext_lookup_extent

This goes straight to a single lookup in the extent list and avoids a
roundtrip through two layers that don't add any value for the simple
quoata file that just has data or holes and no page cache, delayed
allocation, unwritten extent or COW fork (which btw, doesn't seem to
be handled by the existing SEEK HOLE/DATA code).
