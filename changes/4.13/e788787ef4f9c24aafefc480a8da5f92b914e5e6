usb:xhci:Add quirk for Certain failing HP keyboard on reset after resume

Certain HP keyboards would keep inputting a character automatically which
is the wake-up key after S3 resume

On some AMD platforms USB host fails to respond (by holding resume-K) to
USB device (an HP keyboard) resume request within 1ms (TURSM) and ensures
that resume is signaled for at least 20 ms (TDRSMDN), which is defined in
USB 2.0 spec. The result is that the keyboard is out of function.

In SNPS USB design, the host responds to the resume request only after
system gets back to S0 and the host gets to functional after the internal
HW restore operation that is more than 1 second after the initial resume
request from the USB device.

As a workaround for specific keyboard ID(HP Keyboards), applying port reset
after resume when the keyboard is plugged in.
