arm64: mm: select CONFIG_ARCH_PROC_KCORE_TEXT

To avoid issues with the /proc/kcore code getting confused about the
kernels block mappings in the VMALLOC region, enable the existing
facility that describes the [_text, _end) interval as a separate
KCORE_TEXT region, which supersedes the KCORE_VMALLOC region that
it intersects with on arm64.
