clk: keystone: Add sci-clk driver support

In K2G, the clock handling is done through firmware executing on a
separate core. Linux kernel needs to communicate to the firmware
through TI system control interface to access any power management
related resources, including clocks.

The keystone sci-clk driver does this, by communicating to the
firmware through the TI SCI driver. The driver adds support for
registering clocks through DT, and basic required clock operations
like prepare/get_rate, etc.
