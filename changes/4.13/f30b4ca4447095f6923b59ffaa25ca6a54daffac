ASoC: rsnd: reduce confusable macro parameter magic

rsnd_dai_call() macro is using "priv" inside.
Thus, if caller function doesn't have "priv" related operation, strange
phenomenon occur which code is using "priv", but compiler indicates
"unused variable 'priv'".

>From code point of view, it is not problem, but it is very confusable.
This patch removes "priv" from rsnd_dai_call() macro, and adds "priv"
on caller function.
