ARM: shmobile: Update R-Car Gen3 ULCB board part numbers

The board part numbers for the R-Car H3 and M3 ULCB boards corresponded
to versions predating mass production.  Update them for mass production.

Note that the H3 ULCB board can be equipped with either revision ES1.1
or ES2.0 of the R-Car H3 SoC.  While these have different board part
numbers, no new compatible values are needed, as the revision can be
detected at runtime using the PRR register.
