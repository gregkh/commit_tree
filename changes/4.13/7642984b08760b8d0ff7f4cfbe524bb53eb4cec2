i40e: Handle PE_CRITERR properly with IWARP enabled

When IWARP is enabled, we weren't clearing the PE_CRITERR, just logging
it and removing it from the mask. We need to do a corer to reset the
PE_CRITERR register, so set the bit for that as we handle the
interrupt.

We should also be checking for the error against the PFINT_ICR0 register,
and only need to clear it in the value getting written to
PFINT_ICR0_ENA.
