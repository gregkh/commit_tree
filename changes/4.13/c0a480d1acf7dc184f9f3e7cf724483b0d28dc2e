device property: Fix usecount for of_graph_get_port_parent()

Fix inconsistent use of of_graph_get_port_parent() where
asoc_simple_card_parse_graph_dai() does of_node_get() before
calling it while other callers do not. We can fix this by
not trashing the node passed to of_graph_get_port_parent().

Let's also make sure the callers have correct refcounts and remove
related incorrect of_node_put() calls for of_for_each_phandle
as that's done by of_phandle_iterator_next() except when
we break out of the loop early.

Let's fix both issues with a single patch to avoid kobject
refcounts getting messed up more if two patches are merged
separately.

Otherwise strange issues can happen caused by memory corruption
caused by too many kobject_del() calls such as:

BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at
kernel/locking/mutex.c:747
...
(___might_sleep)
(__mutex_lock)
(mutex_lock_nested)
(kernfs_remove)
(kobject_del)
(kobject_put)
(of_get_next_parent)
(of_graph_get_port_parent)
(asoc_simple_card_parse_graph_dai [snd_soc_simple_card_utils])
(asoc_graph_card_probe [snd_soc_audio_graph_card])
