powerpc/watchdog: add locking around init/exit functions

When CPUs start and stop the watchdog, they manipulate shared data
that is normally protected by the lock. Other CPUs can be running
concurrently at this time, so it's a good idea to use locking here
to be on the safe side.

Remove the barrier which is undocumented and didn't do anything.
