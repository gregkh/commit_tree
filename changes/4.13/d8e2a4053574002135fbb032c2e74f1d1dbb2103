powerpc/watchdog: Improve watchdog lock primitive

- Hard-disable interrupts before taking the lock, which prevents
  soft-NMI re-entrancy and therefore can prevent deadlocks.
- Use raw_ variants of local_irq_disable to avoid irq debugging.
- When the lock is contended, spin at low SMT priority, using
  loads only, and with interrupts enabled (where possible).

Some stalls have been noticed at high loads that go away with improved
locking. There should not be so much locking contention in the first
place (which is addressed in a subsequent patch), but locking should
still be improved.
