VFS: Kill off s_options and helpers

Kill off s_options, save/replace_mount_options() and generic_show_options()
as all filesystems now implement ->show_options() for themselves.  This
should make it easier to implement a context-based mount where the mount
options can be passed individually over a file descriptor.
