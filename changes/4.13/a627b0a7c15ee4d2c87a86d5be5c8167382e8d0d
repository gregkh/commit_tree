ext4: remove unused metadata accounting variables

Two variables in ext4_inode_info, i_reserved_meta_blocks and
i_allocated_meta_blocks, are unused.  Removing them saves a little
memory per in-memory inode and cleans up clutter in several tracepoints.
Adjust tracepoint output from ext4_alloc_da_blocks() for consistency
and fix a typo and whitespace near these changes.
