ARM: sun8i: a83t: Add device node for PRCM

The A83T's PRCM has the same set of clocks and resets as the A64.
However, a few dividers are different. And due to the lack of a low
speed 32.768 kHz oscillator, a few of the clock parents are different.

The PRCM also has controls for various power domains. These are not
supported yet, neither in software nor in the device tree binding.
