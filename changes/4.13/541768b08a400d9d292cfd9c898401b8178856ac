usb: dwc3: core: Call dwc3_core_get_phy() before initializing phys

commit f54edb539c116 ("usb: dwc3: core: initialize ULPI before trying to
get the PHY") moved call to dwc3_core_get_phy() from dwc3_probe() to
dwc3_core_init() after dwc3_core_soft_reset(). But
dwc3_core_soft_reset() calls phy_init(), therefore dwc3_core_get_phy()
needs to be called before dwc3_core_soft_reset().

Fix this by moving call to dwc3_core_get_phy() before
dwc3_core_soft_reset().

This fixes the following abort seen on DRA7xx platforms
