Revert "serial: Delete dead code for CIR serial ports"

This reverts commit 1104321a7b3bb670dc614ffa7958c553e7b3b836.

The code is not dead at all and breaks winbond-cir.

Serial: 8250/16550 driver, 32 ports, IRQ sharing enabled
00:02: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4, base_baud = 115200) is a 16550A
00:03: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3, base_baud = 115200) is a CIR port
lirc lirc0: lirc_dev: driver ir-lirc-codec (winbond-cir) registered at minor = 0
winbond-cir 00:03: Region 0x2f8-0x2ff already in use!
winbond-cir: probe of 00:03 failed with error -16
