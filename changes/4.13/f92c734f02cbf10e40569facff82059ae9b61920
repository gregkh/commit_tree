rcu: Prevent rcu_barrier() from starting needless grace periods

Currently rcu_barrier() uses call_rcu() to enqueue new callbacks
on each CPU with a non-empty callback list.  This works, but means
that rcu_barrier() forces grace periods that are not otherwise needed.
The key point is that rcu_barrier() never needs to wait for a grace
period, but instead only for all pre-existing callbacks to be invoked.
This means that rcu_barrier()'s new callbacks should be placed in
the callback-list segment containing the last pre-existing callback.

This commit makes this change using the new rcu_segcblist_entrain()
function.
