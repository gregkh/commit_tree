xhci: Add support for endpoint soft reset

xhci supports soft retry recovery when the host halted the host side of an
endopint but the connected USB device is not aware of the halt.

In this case xhci needs to issue a reset endopint command  with a TSP
(Transfer State Preserve) flag set which preserves the Data toggle
and Sequence number of the endpoint.

This feature is needed to handle a few special transfer event types
such as USB Transaction error that don't always point to a causing TRB.

see xhci 4.6.8.1 for more details
