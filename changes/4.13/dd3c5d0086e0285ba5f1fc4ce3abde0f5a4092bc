media: staging: cxd2099: Fixed buffer mode

The buffer mode was already implemented in this driver, but it did not work
as expected. This has been fixed now, but it is still deactivated and can
be activated by removing a comment at the begin of the file.

Original code change by Ralph Metzler, modified by Jasmin Jessich and
Daniel Scheller to match Kernel code style.
