Provide a function to create a NUL-terminated string from unterminated data

Provide a function, kmemdup_nul(), that will create a NUL-terminated string
from an unterminated character array where the length is known in advance.

This is better than kstrndup() in situations where we already know the
string length as the strnlen() in kstrndup() is superfluous.
