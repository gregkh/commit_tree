uuid: rename uuid types

Our "little endian" UUID really is a Wintel GUID, so rename it and its
helpers such (guid_t).  The big endian UUID is the only true one, so
give it the name uuid_t.  The uuid_le and uuid_be names are retained for
now, but will hopefully go away soon.  The exception to that are the _cmp
helpers that will be replaced by better primitives ASAP and thus don't
get the new names.

Also the _to_bin helpers are named to match the better named uuid_parse
routine in userspace.

Also remove the existing typedef in XFS that's now been superceeded by
the generic type name.
