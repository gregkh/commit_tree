s390/pci: improve error handling during interrupt deregistration

When we ask a function to stop creating interrupts this may fail
due to the function being already gone (e.g. after hot-unplug).

Consequently we don't free associated resources like summary bits
and bit vectors used for irq processing. This could lead to
situations where we ran out of these resources and fail to setup
new interrupts.

The fix is to just ignore the errors in cases where we can be
sure no new interrupts are generated.
