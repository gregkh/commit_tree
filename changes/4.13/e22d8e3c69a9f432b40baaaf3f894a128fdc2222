drm/i915: Treat WC a separate cache domain

When discussing a new WC mmap, we based the interface upon the
assumption that GTT was fully coherent. How naive! Commits 3b5724d702ef
("drm/i915: Wait for writes through the GTT to land before reading
back") and ed4596ea992d ("drm/i915/guc: WA to address the Ringbuffer
coherency issue") demonstrate that writes through the GTT are indeed
delayed and may be overtaken by direct WC access. To be safe, if
userspace is mixing WC mmaps with other potential GTT access (pwrite,
GTT mmaps) it should use set_domain(WC).
