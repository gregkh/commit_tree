net: qcom/emac: do not reset the EMAC during initialization

On ACPI systems, the driver depends on firmware pre-initializing the
EMAC because we don't have access to the clocks, and the EMAC has specific
clock programming requirements.  Therefore, we don't want to reset the
EMAC while we are completing the initialization.
