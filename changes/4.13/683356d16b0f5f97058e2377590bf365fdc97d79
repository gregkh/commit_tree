staging: ks7010: hostif, u16 data types to __le16

Target device is little endian. Host interface data structures used
for building frames to pass to target device should use little endian
data types. All u16 structure members in ks_hostif.h need to be
changed to __le16, Sparse can then be used to make sure we update all
code that touches these data.

Change all u16 data types in host interface structures to be
__le16. Update all code that touches modified data types. Check using
Sparse.
