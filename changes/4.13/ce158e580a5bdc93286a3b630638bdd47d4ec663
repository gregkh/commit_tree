xdp: add reporting of offload mode

Extend the XDP_ATTACHED_* values to include offloaded mode.
Let drivers report whether program is installed in the driver
or the HW by changing the prog_attached field from bool to
u8 (type of the netlink attribute).

Exploit the fact that the value of XDP_ATTACHED_DRV is 1,
therefore since all drivers currently assign the mode with
double negation:
       mode = !!xdp_prog;
no drivers have to be modified.
