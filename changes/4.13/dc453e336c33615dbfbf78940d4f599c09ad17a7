drm/i915: Drop pipe A quirk for Toshiba Protege R205-S209

The pipe A force quirk shouldn't needed except on 830. So let's nuke it
for the Toshiba Protege R-205/S-209 945 machines. This quirk pre-dates
KMS so it's usefulness is doubtful at best now.

Unfortunately the original bug report [1] isn't very helpful since it
doesn't describe the symptoms. And the commit message in xf86-video-intel
commit ecdb5963ef68 ("Add pipe A force enable quirk for Toshiba Portege R205-S209")
is not much help either.

However, if we assume the problem was the typical "closing the lid
hangs the box" type of thing, we already nuked the quirk for another
945 machine in
commit 736a69ca8c99 ("drm/i915: Drop PIPE-A quirk for 945GSE HP Mini")
and so I hope we can drop this one as well.
