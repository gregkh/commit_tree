Input: trackpoint - assume 3 buttons when buttons detection fails

Trackpoint buttons detection fails on ThinkPad 570 and 470 series,
this makes the middle button of the trackpoint to not being recogized.
As I don't believe there is any trackpoint with less than 3 buttons this
patch just assumes three buttons when the extended button information
read fails.
