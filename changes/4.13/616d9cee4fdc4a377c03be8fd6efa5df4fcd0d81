drm/i915: First try the previous execbuffer location

When choosing a slot for an execbuffer, we ideally want to use the same
address as last time (so that we don't have to rebind it) and the same
address as expected by the user (so that we don't have to fixup any
relocations pointing to it). If we first try to bind the incoming
execbuffer->offset from the user, or the currently bound offset that
should hopefully achieve the goal of avoiding the rebind cost and the
relocation penalty. However, if the object is not currently bound there
we don't want to arbitrarily unbind an object in our chosen position and
so choose to rebind/relocate the incoming object instead. After we
report the new position back to the user, on the next pass the
relocations should have settled down.
