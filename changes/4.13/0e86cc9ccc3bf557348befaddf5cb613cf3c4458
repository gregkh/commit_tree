drm/i915/gvt: implement per-vm mmio switching optimization

Commit ab9da627906a ("drm/i915: make context status notifier head be
per engine") gives us a chance to inspect every single request. Then
we can eliminate unnecessary mmio switching for same vGPU. We only
need mmio switching for different VMs (including host).

This patch introduced a new general API intel_gvt_switch_mmio() to
replace the old intel_gvt_load/restore_render_mmio(). This function
can be further optimized for vGPU to vGPU switching.

To support individual ring switch, we track the owner who occupy
each ring. When another VM or host request a ring we do the mmio
context switching. Otherwise no need to switch the ring.

This optimization is very useful if only one guest has plenty of
workloads and the host is mostly idle. The best case is no mmio
switching will happen.

v2:
  o fix missing ring switch issue. (chuanxiao)
  o support individual ring switch.
