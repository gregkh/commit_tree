x86/efi: Extend CONFIG_EFI_PGT_DUMP support to x86_32 and kexec as well

CONFIG_EFI_PGT_DUMP=y, as the name suggests, dumps EFI page tables to the
kernel log during kernel boot.

This feature is very useful while debugging page faults/null pointer
dereferences to EFI related addresses.

Presently, this feature is limited only to x86_64, so let's extend it to
other EFI configurations like kexec kernel, efi=old_map and to x86_32 as well.

This doesn't effect normal boot path because this config option should
be used only for debug purposes.
