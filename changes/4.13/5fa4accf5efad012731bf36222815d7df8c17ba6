serial: meson: hide an unused function

The newly added meson_uart_enable_tx_engine function is only called
from the console setup, not the runtime uart, which has an open-coded
version of the same register access. This produces a harmless warning
when the console code is disabled:

drivers/tty/serial/meson_uart.c:127:13: error: 'meson_uart_enable_tx_engine' defined but not used [-Werror=unused-function]

Let's move the function inside of the #ifdef to avoid the warning.
