MIPS: CM: Avoid per-core locking with CM3 & higher

CM3 provides a GCR_CL_OTHER register per VP, rather than only per core.
This means that we don't need to prevent other VPs within a core from
racing with code that makes use of the core-other register region.

Reduce locking overhead by demoting the per-core spinlock providing
protection for CM2.5 & lower to a per-CPU/per-VP spinlock for CM3 &
higher.
