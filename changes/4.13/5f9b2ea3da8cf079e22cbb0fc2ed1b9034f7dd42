spmi: pmic_arb: use appropriate flow handler

The current code uses handle_level_irq flow handler even if the
trigger type of the interrupt is edge. This can lead to missing
of an edge transition that happens when the interrupt is being
handled. The level flow handler masks the interrupt while it is
being handled, so if an edge transition happens at that time,
that edge is lost.

Use an edge flow handler for edge type interrupts which ensures
that the interrupt stays enabled while being handled - at least
until it triggers at which point the flow handler sets the
IRQF_PENDING flag and only then masks the interrupt. That
IRQF_PENDING state indicates an edge transition happened while
the interrupt was being handled and the handler is called again.
