rtlwifi: btcoex: 23b 1ant: check more cases when bt is queing

If bt is queing, we need to set the packet priority properly.
Originally we only consider if wifi was connected or not, but now we
also consider if bt is under abnormal scan or wifi is scanning, roaming
or linking, and set the coex table.
