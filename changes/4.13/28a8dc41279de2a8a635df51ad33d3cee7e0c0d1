ima: use ima_parse_buf() to parse template data

The binary_field_data structure definition has been removed from
ima_restore_template_data(). The lengths and data pointers are directly
stored into the template_data array of the ima_template_entry structure.
For template data, both the number of fields and buffer end checks can
be done, as these information are known (respectively from the template
descriptor, and from the measurement header field).
