usb: core: Check URB setup_packet and transfer_buffer sanity

Update usb_hcd_map_urb_for_dma() to check for an URB's setup_packet and
transfer_buffer sanity. We first check that urb->setup_packet is neither
coming from vmalloc space nor is an on stack buffer, and if that's the
case, produce a warning and return an error. For urb->transfer_buffer
there is an existing is_vmalloc_addr() check so we just supplement that
with an object_is_on_stack() check, produce a warning if that is the case
and also return an error.
