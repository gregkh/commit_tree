USB: hcd: Mark secondary HCD as dead if the primary one died

Make usb_hc_died() clear the HCD_FLAG_RH_RUNNING flag for the shared
HCD and set HCD_FLAG_DEAD for it, in analogy with what is done for
the primary one.

Among other thigs, this prevents check_root_hub_suspended() from
returning -EBUSY for dead HCDs which helps to work around system
suspend issues in some situations.

This actually fixes occasional suspend failures on one of my test
machines.
