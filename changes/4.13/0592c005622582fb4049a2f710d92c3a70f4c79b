KVM: arm/arm64: replace pause checks with vcpu request checks

The current use of KVM_REQ_VCPU_EXIT for pause is fine.  Even the
requester clearing the request is OK, as this is the special case
where the sole requesting thread and receiving VCPU are executing
synchronously (see "Clearing Requests" in
Documentation/virtual/kvm/vcpu-requests.rst) However, that's about
to change, so let's ensure only the receiving VCPU clears the
request. Additionally, by guaranteeing KVM_REQ_VCPU_EXIT is always
set when pause is, we can avoid checking pause directly in VCPU RUN.
