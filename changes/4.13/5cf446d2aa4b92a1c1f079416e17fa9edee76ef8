scsi: qedf: Use same logic for SCSI host reset and FC lip_reset.

We should be using the same logic to do a soft reset of the FCoE function
whether it is initiated via sg_reset or the fc_host issue_lip attribute.
Refactor the host reset and fcoe reset handlers to use the preferred logic
which is currently contained in qedf_eh_host_reset().
