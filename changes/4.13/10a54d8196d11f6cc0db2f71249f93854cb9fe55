iwlwifi: pcie: move rx workqueue initialization to iwl_trans_pcie_alloc()

Work queues cannot be allocated when a mutex is held because the mutex
may be in use and that would make it sleep.  Doing so generates the
following splat with 4.13+:

[   19.514338] which lock already depends on the new lock.

This lock dependency already existed with previous kernel versions,
but it was not detected until commit 49dfe2a67797 ("cpuhotplug: Link
lock stacks for hotplug callbacks") was introduced.
