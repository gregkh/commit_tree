iio: hid-sensor-trigger: Fix the race with user space powering up sensors

It has been reported for a while that with iio-sensor-proxy service the
rotation only works after one suspend/resume cycle. This required a wait
in the systemd unit file to avoid race. I found a Yoga 900 where I could
reproduce this.

The problem scenerio is:
- During sensor driver init, enable run time PM and also set a
  auto-suspend for 3 seconds.
	This result in one runtime resume. But there is a check to avoid
a powerup in this sequence, but rpm is active
- User space iio-sensor-proxy tries to power up the sensor. Since rpm is
  active it will simply return. But sensors were not actually
powered up in the prior sequence, so actaully the sensors will not work
- After 3 seconds the auto suspend kicks

If we add a wait in systemd service file to fire iio-sensor-proxy after
3 seconds, then now everything will work as the runtime resume will
actually powerup the sensor as this is a user request.

To avoid this:
- Remove the check to match user requested state, this will cause a
  brief powerup, but if the iio-sensor-proxy starts immediately it will
still work as the sensors are ON.
- Also move the autosuspend delay to place when user requested turn off
  of sensors, like after user finished raw read or buffer disable
