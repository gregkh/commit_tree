fs/proc: kcore: use kcore_list type to check for vmalloc/module address

Instead of passing each start address into is_vmalloc_or_module_addr()
to decide whether it falls into either the VMALLOC or the MODULES region,
we can simply check the type field of the current kcore_list entry, since
it will be set to KCORE_VMALLOC based on exactly the same conditions.

As a bonus, when reading the KCORE_TEXT region on architectures that have
one, this will avoid using vread() on the region if it happens to intersect
with a KCORE_VMALLOC region. This is due the fact that the KCORE_TEXT
region is the first one to be added to the kcore region list.
