net: ipv4: Convert inet_rtm_getroute to rcu versions of route lookup

Convert inet_rtm_getroute to use ip_route_input_rcu and
ip_route_output_key_hash_rcu passing the fib_result arg to both.
The rcu lock is held through the creation of the response, so the
rtable/dst does not need to be attached to the skb and is passed
to rt_fill_info directly.

In converting from ip_route_output_key to ip_route_output_key_hash_rcu
the xfrm_lookup_route in ip_route_output_flow is dropped since
flowi4_proto is not set for a route get request.
