tty: serial: lpuart: add imx7ulp support

The lpuart of imx7ulp is basically the same as ls1021a. It's also
32 bit width register, but unlike ls1021a, it's little endian.
Besides that, imx7ulp lpuart has a minor different register layout
from ls1021a that it has four extra registers (verid, param, global,
pincfg) located at the beginning of register map, which are currently
not used by the driver and less to be used later.

To ease the register difference handling, we add a reg_off member
in lpuart_soc_data structure to represent if the normal
lpuart32_{read|write} requires plus a offset to hide the issue.
