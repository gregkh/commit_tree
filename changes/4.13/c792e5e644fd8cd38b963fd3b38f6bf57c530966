arm64: defconfig: enable APEI and GHES features

ARM64 server platforms can support ACPI Platform Error Interface (APEI)
and Generic Hardware Error Source (GHES) features, so enable them.

Platforms which support the firmware-first RAS error reporting model
require APEI and GHES functionality for the OS to receive and report
error records provided by the platform.

PCIe AER functionality is required for PCIe AER errors to be properly
reported and recovered from.
