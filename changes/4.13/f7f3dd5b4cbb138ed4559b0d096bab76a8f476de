ACPI: APD: Fix HID for Hisilicon Hip07/08

ACPI HID for Hisilicon Hip07/08 should be HISI02A1/2,
not HISI0A21/2, HISI02A1/2 was tested ok but was modified
by the stupid typo when upstream the patches (by me),
correct them to the right IDs (matching the IDs in
drivers/i2c/busses/i2c-designware-platdrv.c).
