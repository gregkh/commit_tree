ext4: add missing xattr hash update

When updating an extended attribute, if the padded value sizes are the
same, a shortcut is taken to avoid the bulk of the work. This was fine
until the xattr hash update was moved inside ext4_xattr_set_entry().
With that change, the hash update got missed in the shortcut case.

Thanks to ZhangYi (yizhang089@gmail.com) for root causing the problem.
