kbuild: thin archives use P option to ar

The P option makes ar do full path name matching and can prevent ar
from discarding files with duplicate names in some cases of creating
thin archives from thin archives. The sh architecture in particular
loses some object files from its kernel/cpu/sh*/ directories without
this option.

This could be a bug in binutils ar, but the P option should not cause
any negative effects so it is safe to use to work around this with.
