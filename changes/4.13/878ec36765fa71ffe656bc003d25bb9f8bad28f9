ARM: NOMMU: Wire-up default DMA interface

The way how default DMA pool is exposed has changed and now we need to
use dedicated interface to work with it. This patch makes alloc/release
operations to use such interface. Since, default DMA pool is not
handled by generic code anymore we have to implement our own mmap
operation.
