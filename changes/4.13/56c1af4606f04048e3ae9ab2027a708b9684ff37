PCI: Add sysfs max_link_speed/width, current_link_speed/width, etc

Expose PCIe bridges attributes such as secondary bus number, subordinate
bus number, max link speed and link width, current link speed and link
width via sysfs in /sys/bus/pci/devices/...

This information is available via lspci, but that requires root privilege.
