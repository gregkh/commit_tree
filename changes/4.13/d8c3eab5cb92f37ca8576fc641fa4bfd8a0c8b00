tpm: Apply a sane minimum adapterlimit value for retransmission.

When the I2C Infineon part is attached to an I2C adapter that imposes
a size limitation, large requests will fail with -EOPNOTSUPP. Retry
them with a sane minimum size without re-issuing the 0x05 command
as this appears to occasionally put the TPM in a bad state.
