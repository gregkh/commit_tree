mm/vmstat.c: standardize file operations variable names

Standardize the file operation variable names related to all four memory
management /proc interface files.  Also change all the symbol
permissions (S_IRUGO) into octal permissions (0444) as it got complaints
from checkpatch.pl.  This does not create any functional change to the
interface.
