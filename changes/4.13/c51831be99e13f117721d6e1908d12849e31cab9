staging: ccree: register setkey for none hash macs

The original ccree driver was registering a useless setkey
method even for non-MAC hash transformations. Somewhere
around v4.9 a check was added that failed hash operations
if a setkey method was registered but was not called,
so during the initial upstream port code was added to
only register the setkey method for MAC type hash transform.

Unfortunately, the ccree driver also registers non-hash based
MAC transforms and the code had a logic error that stopped
it registering a setkey callback even for those, thus rendering
them useless.

This commit fixes the logic mistake, thus correctly registering
a setkey method only for MAC transformations, leaving it out
for non-MAC ones, whether they are hash based on not.

Fixes: 50cfbbb7e627 ("staging: ccree: add ahash support").
