posix-timers: Zero out oldval itimerspec

The recent posix timer rework moved the clearing of the itimerspec to the
real syscall implementation, but forgot that the kclock->timer_get() is
used by timer_settime() as well. That results in an uninitialized variable
and bogus values returned to user space.

Add the missing memset to timer_settime().
