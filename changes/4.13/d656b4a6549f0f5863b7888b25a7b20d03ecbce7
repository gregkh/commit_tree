ALSA: pcm: remove function local variable with alternative evaluation

A local variable is used to judge whether a parameter should be handled
due to reverse dependency of the other rules. However, this can be
obsoleted by check of a sentinel in dependency array.

This commit removes the local variable and check the sentinel to reduce
stack usage.
