ACPI: SPCR: Workaround for APM X-Gene 8250 UART 32-alignment errata

APM X-Gene verion 1 and 2 have an 8250 UART with its register
aligned to 32-bit. In addition, the latest released BIOS
encodes the access field as 8-bit access instead 32-bit access.
This causes no console with ACPI boot as the console
will not match X-Gene UART port due to the lack of mmio32
option.
