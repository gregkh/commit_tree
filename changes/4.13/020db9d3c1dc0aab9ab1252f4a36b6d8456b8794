xen/events: Fix interrupt lost during irq_disable and irq_enable

Here is a device has xen-pirq-MSI interrupt. Dom0 might lost interrupt
during driver irq_disable/irq_enable. Here is the scenario,
 1. irq_disable -> disable_dynirq -> mask_evtchn(irq channel)
 2. dev interrupt raised by HW and Xen mark its evtchn as pending
 3. irq_enable -> startup_pirq -> eoi_pirq ->
    clear_evtchn(channel of irq) -> clear pending status
 4. consume_one_event process the irq event without pending bit assert
    which result in interrupt lost once
 5. No HW interrupt raising anymore.

Now use enable_dynirq for enable_pirq of xen_pirq_chip to remove
eoi_pirq when irq_enable.
