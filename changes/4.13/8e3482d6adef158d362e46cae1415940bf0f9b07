mlxsw: spectrum_router: Flood packets to router after RIF creation

If a packet ingress the router but can't be assigned an ingress RIF,
it's dropped.

Therefore, in the case of RIF configured on top of a bridge, it makes
sense to start flooding broadcast packets to the router only after the
RIF was created.
