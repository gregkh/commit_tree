drm/dp: Add DP MST helpers to atomically find and release vcpi slots

drm_dp_atomic_find_vcpi_slots() should be called from ->atomic_check() to
check there are sufficient vcpi slots for a mode and to add that to the
state. This should be followed by a call to drm_dp_mst_allocate_vcpi()
in ->atomic_commit() to initialize a struct vcpi for the port.

drm_dp_atomic_release_vcpi_slots() should be called from
->atomic_check() to release a port's vcpi slot allocation from the
state.

Drivers that do not make use of this atomic helper are expected to call
drm_dp_find_vcpi_slots() instead before calling
drm_dp_mst_allocate_vcpi().

v3: drm_dp_atomic_release_vcpi_slots() now needs to know how many slots
    to release as we may not have a valid reference to port.
v2:
Added checks for verifying the port reference is valid
Moved get_mst_topology_state() into the helpers (Daniel)
Changed find_vcpi_slots() to not depend on current allocation
