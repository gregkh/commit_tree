rt2x00: convert rt2x00_eeprom_read return type

This is a semi-automated conversion to change rt2x00_eeprom_read()
to return the register contents instead of passing them by value,
resulting in much better object code. The majority of the patch
was done using:

sed -i 's:\(\<rt2x00_eeprom_read\>(.*, .*\), &\(.*\));:\2 = \1);:' \
   -i 's:= _\(rt2x00_eeprom_read\):= \1:' drivers/net/wireless/ralink/rt2x00/*
