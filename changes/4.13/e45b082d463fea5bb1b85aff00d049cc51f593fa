highuid.txt: standardize document format

Each text file under Documentation follows a different
format. Some doesn't even have titles!

Change its representation to follow the adopted standard,
using ReST markups for it to be parseable by Sphinx:

- use a markup for the title;
- use :Author: and :Last updated: markups at the beginning with
  authorship info;
- use proper markups for the lists.
