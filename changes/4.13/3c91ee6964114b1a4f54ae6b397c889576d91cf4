Btrfs: work around maybe-uninitialized warning

A rewrite of btrfs_submit_direct_hook appears to have introduced a warning:

fs/btrfs/inode.c: In function 'btrfs_submit_direct_hook':
fs/btrfs/inode.c:8467:14: error: 'bio' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

Where the 'bio' variable was previously initialized unconditionally, it
is now set in the "while (submit_len > 0)" loop that would never execute
if submit_len is zero.

Assuming this cannot happen in practice, we can avoid the warning
by simply replacing the while{} loop with a do{}while() loop so
the compiler knows that it will always be entered at least once.

Fixes changes introduced in "Btrfs: use bio_clone_bioset_partial to
simplify DIO submit".
