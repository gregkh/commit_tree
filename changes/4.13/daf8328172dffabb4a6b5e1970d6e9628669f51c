ext4: eliminate xattr entry e_hash recalculation for removes

When an extended attribute block is modified, ext4_xattr_hash_entry()
recalculates e_hash for the entry that is pointed by s->here. This  is
unnecessary if the modification is to remove an entry.

Currently, if the removed entry is the last one and there are other
entries remaining, hash calculation targets the just erased entry which
has been filled with zeroes and effectively does nothing.  If the removed
entry is not the last one and there are more entries, this time it will
recalculate hash on the next entry which is totally unnecessary.

Fix these by moving the decision on when to recalculate hash to
ext4_xattr_set_entry().
