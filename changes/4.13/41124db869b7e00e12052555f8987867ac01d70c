fs: warn in case userspace lied about modprobe return

kmod <= v19 was broken -- it could return 0 to modprobe calls,
incorrectly assuming that a kernel module was built-in, whereas in
reality the module was just forming in the kernel. The reason for this
is an incorrect userspace heuristics. A userspace kmod fix is available
for it [0], however should userspace break again we could go on with
an failed get_fs_type() which is hard to debug as the request_module()
is detected as returning 0. The first suspect would be that there is
something worth with the kernel's module loader and obviously in this
case that is not the issue.

Since these issues are painful to debug complain when we know userspace
has outright lied to us.
