net: ipv4: refactor __ip_route_output_key_hash

A later patch wants access to the fib result on an output route lookup
with the rcu lock held. Refactor __ip_route_output_key_hash, pushing
the logic between rcu_read_lock ... rcu_read_unlock into a new helper
with the fib_result as an input arg.

To keep the name length under control remove the leading underscores
from the name and add _rcu to the name of the new helper indicating it
is called with the rcu read lock held.
