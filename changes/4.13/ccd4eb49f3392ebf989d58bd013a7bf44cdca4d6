net/packet: Fix Tx queue selection for AF_PACKET

When PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS is not used, Tx queue selection will be done
before the packet is enqueued, taking into account any mappings set by
a queuing discipline such as mqprio without hardware offloading. This
selection may be affected by a previously saved queue_mapping, either on
the Rx path, or done before the packet reaches the device, as it's
currently the case for AF_PACKET.

In order for queue selection to work as expected when using traffic
control, there can't be another selection done before that point is
reached, so move the call to packet_pick_tx_queue to
packet_direct_xmit, leaving the default xmit path as it was before
PACKET_QDISC_BYPASS was introduced.

A forward declaration of packet_pick_tx_queue() is introduced to avoid
the need to reorder the functions within the file.
