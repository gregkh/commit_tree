ARM: OMAP2+: Fix omap3 prm shared irq

Shared interrupts with IRQ_NOAUTOEN got a warning added with commit
04c848d39879 ("genirq: Warn when IRQ_NOAUTOEN is used with shared
interrupts").

Let's just drop the IRQ_NOAUTOEN use for omap3 PRM shared interrupt as
it does not seem to cause any other issues based on my testing. We have
moved a lot of the code to initialize later, and whatever problems the
legacy booting had seem to be gone now with pinctrl driver and device
tree based booting.

Otherwise we will get:

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at kernel/irq/manage.c:1348 __setup_irq+0x5d0/0x64c

(driver_probe_device+0x33c/0x478)

Note that we also need to remove the related enable_irq() to avoid
getting the following:
