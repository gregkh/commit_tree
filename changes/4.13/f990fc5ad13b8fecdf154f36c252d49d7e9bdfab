xfs: remove lsn relevant fields from xfs_trans structure and its users

The t_lsn is not used anymore and the t_commit_lsn is used as a tmp
storage for the checkpoint sequence number only in the current code.

And the start/commit lsn are tracked as a transaction group tag in
the xfs_cil_ctx instead of a single transaction, so remove them from
the xfs_trans structure and their users to match with the design.
