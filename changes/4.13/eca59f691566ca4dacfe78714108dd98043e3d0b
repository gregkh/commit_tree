net: Remove support for bridge bypass ndos from stacked devices

Remove support for bridge bypass ndos from stacked devices. At this point
no driver which supports stack device behavior offload supports operation
with SELF flag. The case for upper device is already taken care of in both
of the following cases:

1. FDB add/del - driver should check at the notification cb if the
                 stacked device contains his ports.

2. Port attribute - calls switchdev code directly which checks
                    for case of stack device.
