skbuff: only inherit relevant tx_flags

When inheriting tx_flags from one skbuff to another, always apply a
mask to avoid overwriting unrelated other bits in the field.

The two SKBTX_SHARED_FRAG cases clears all other bits. In practice,
tx_flags are zero at this point now. But this is fragile. Timestamp
flags are set, for instance, if in tcp_gso_segment, after this clear
in skb_segment.

The SKBTX_ANY_TSTAMP mask in __skb_tstamp_tx ensures that new
skbs do not accidentally inherit flags such as SKBTX_SHARED_FRAG.
