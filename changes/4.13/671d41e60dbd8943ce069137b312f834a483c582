net-next: mediatek: add RX IRQ delay support

The PDMA engine used for RX allows IRQ aggregation. The patch sets up the
corresponding registers to aggregate 4 IRQs into one. Using aggregation
reduces the load on the core handling to a quarter thus reducing IRQ
latency and increasing RX performance by around 10%.
