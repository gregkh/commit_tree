powerpc/64s: Avoid cpabort in context switch when possible

The ISA v3.0B copy-paste facility only requires cpabort when switching
to a process that has foreign real addresses mapped (direct access to
accelerators), to clear a potential copy buffer filled by a previous
thread. There is no accelerator driver implemented yet, so cpabort can
be removed. It can be be re-added when a driver is implemented.

POWER9 DD1 requires the copy buffer to always be cleared on context
switch, but if accelerators are not in use, then an unpaired copy from
a dummy region is sufficient to clear data out of the copy buffer.

This increases context switch performance by about 5% on POWER9.
