drm/i915/cnl: Introduce Cannonlake platform defition.

Cannonlake is a Intel® Processor containing Intel® HD Graphics
following Kabylake.

It is Gen10.

Let's start by adding the platform definition based on previous
platforms but yet as alpha_support.

On following patches we will start adding PCI IDs and the
platform specific changes.

CNL has an increased DDB size as Damien had previously
noticed and provided a separated patch that got squashed here.

v2: Squash DDB size here per Ander request.
