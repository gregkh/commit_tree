staging: wilc1000: New cfg packet format in handle_set_wfi_drv_handler

Change the config packet format used in handle_set_wfi_drv_handler()
to align the host driver with the new format used in the wilc firmware.

The change updates the format in which the host driver provides the
firmware with the drv_handler index and also uses two new
fields viz. "mode" and 'name" in the config packet along with this index
to directly provide details about the interface and its mode to the
firmware instead of having multiple if-else statements in the host driver
to decide which interface to configure.

This change requires users to move to the newer version of the wilc
firmware(14.02 or higher) available on the vendor tree on github or on the
linux-firmware project. The existing firmware files on the linux-firmware
project are very old and best not used.
