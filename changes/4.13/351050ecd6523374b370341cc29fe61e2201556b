kcm: do not attach PF_KCM sockets to avoid deadlock

syzkaller had no problem to trigger a deadlock, attaching a KCM socket
to another one (or itself). (original syzkaller report was a very
confusing lockdep splat during a sendmsg())

It seems KCM claims to only support TCP, but no enforcement is done,
so we might need to add additional checks.
