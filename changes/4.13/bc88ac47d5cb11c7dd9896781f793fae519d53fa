scsi: cxlflash: Support AFU debug

Adopt the SISLite AFU debug capability to allow future CXL Flash
adapters the ability to better debug AFU issues. Update the SISLite
header with the changes necessary to support AFU debug operations
and create a host ioctl interface for user debug software. Also
update the cxlflash documentation to describe this new host ioctl.
