rtc: brcmstb-waketimer: Add Broadcom STB wake-timer

This adds support for the Broadcom STB wake-timer which is a timer in
the chip's 27Mhz clock domain that offers the ability to wake the system
(wake-up source) from suspend states (S2, S3, S5). It is supported using
the rtc framework allowing us to configure alarms for system wake-up.
