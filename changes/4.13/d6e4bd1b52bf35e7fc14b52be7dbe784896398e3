nvmem: rockchip-efuse: amend compatible rk322x-efuse to rk3228-efuse

As the comments from Heiko Stuebner <heiko@sntech.de> that compatible
should not contain any placeholders, this patch fix it for rk3228 SoC.

Note that this is a fix for v4.13, due to fixing the current non-standard
binding name that should not become part of an official kernel release.
