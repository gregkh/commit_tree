rcu: Move expediting-related access/control out of rcupdate.h

The rcu_gp_is_normal(), rcu_gp_is_expedited(), rcu_expedite_gp(), and
rcu_unexpedite_gp() functions are intended only for use within the
RCU implementation itself -- the sysfs access is what should be used
outside of RCU.  This commit therefore moves the declarations for
these functions to kernel/rcu/rcu.h, and also includes this file into
kernel/rcu/rcutorture.c and kernel/rcu/rcuperf.c.  This also has the
beneficial effect of shrinking rcupdate.c a bit.
