usb: gadget: configfs: make qw_sign attribute symmetric

Currently qw_sign requires UTF-8 character to set, but returns UTF-16
when read. This isn't obvious when simply using cat since the null
characters are not visible, but hexdump unveils the true string:

  # echo MSFT100 > os_desc/qw_sign
  # hexdump -C os_desc/qw_sign
  00000000  4d 00 53 00 46 00 54 00  31 00 30 00 30 00        |M.S.F.T.1.0.0.|

Make qw_sign symmetric by returning an UTF-8 string too. Also follow
common convention and add a new line at the end.
