platform/chrome: cros_ec_lightbar - Add lightbar program feature to sysfs

Add a program feature so we can upload and run programs for lightbar
sequences. We should be able to use this to shift sequences out of the
EC and save space there.

  $ cat <suitable program bin> > /sys/devices/.../cros_ec/program
  $ echo program > /sys/devices/.../cros_ec/sequence
