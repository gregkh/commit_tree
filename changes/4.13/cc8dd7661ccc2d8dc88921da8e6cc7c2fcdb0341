drm/omap: fix tiled buffer stride calculations

omap_gem uses page alignment for buffer stride. The related calculations
are a bit off, though, as byte stride of 4096 gets aligned to 8192,
instead of 4096.

This patch changes the code to use DIV_ROUND_UP(), which fixes those
calculations and makes them more readable.
