ext4: ea_inode owner should be the same as the inode owner

Quota charging is based on the ownership of the inode. Currently, the
xattr inode owner is set to the caller which may be different from the
parent inode owner. This is inconsistent with how quota is charged for
xattr block and regular data block writes.
