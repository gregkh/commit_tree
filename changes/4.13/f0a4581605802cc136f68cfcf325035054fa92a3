net: phy: marvell: make some functions static

functions m88e1510_get_temp_critical, m88e1510_set_temp_critical and
m88e1510_get_temp_alarm can be made static as they not need to be
in global scope.

Cleans up sparse warnings:
 "symbol 'm88e1510_get_temp_alarm' was not declared. Should it be static?"
 "symbol 'm88e1510_get_temp_critical' was not declared. Should it be
  static?"
