platform/x86: fujitsu-laptop: allocate fujitsu_bl in acpi_fujitsu_bl_add()

Only allocate memory for struct fujitsu_bl when the FUJ02B1 ACPI device
is present.  Use devm_kzalloc() for allocating memory to simplify
cleanup.

Due to the fact that the power property of the backlight device created
by the backlight driver is accessed from acpi_fujitsu_laptop_add(),
pointer to the allocated memory will remain stored in a module-wide
variable until the backlight driver is extracted into a separate module.
