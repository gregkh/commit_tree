KVM: arm/arm64: Allow GICv2 to supply a uaccess register function

We are about to differentiate between writes from a VCPU and from
userspace to the GIC's GICD_ISACTIVER and GICD_ICACTIVER registers due
to different synchronization requirements.

Expand the macro to define a register description for the GIC to take
uaccess functions as well.
