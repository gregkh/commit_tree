drm/i915: Enable HPLL watermarks on g4x

I don't see why we couldn't use the HPLL watermarks on g4x. So let's
enable them. Let's assume a 35 usec memory latency for the HPLL mode.
That's roughly what PNV uses.

Based on the behaviour of the ELK box I have 35 usec is probably
overkill. Actually all the current latency values used seem overkill as
I can reduce them pretty drastically before I start to see underruns.
But let's play things a bit safe for now.
