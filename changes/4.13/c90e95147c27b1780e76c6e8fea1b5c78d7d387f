net_sched: remove warning from qdisc_hash_add

It was added in commit e57a784d8cae ("pkt_sched: set root qdisc
before change() in attach_default_qdiscs()") to hide duplicates
from "tc qdisc show" for incative deivices.

After 59cc1f61f ("net: sched: convert qdisc linked list to hashtable")
it triggered when classful qdisc is added to inactive device because
default qdiscs are added before switching root qdisc.

Anyway after commit ea3274695353 ("net: sched: avoid duplicates in
qdisc dump") duplicates are filtered right in dumper.
