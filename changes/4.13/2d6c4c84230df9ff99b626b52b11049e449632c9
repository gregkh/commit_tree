drm/i915: Use discardable buffers for rings

The contents of a ring are only valid between HEAD and TAIL, when the
ring is idle (HEAD == TAIL) we can simply let the pages go under memory
pressure if they are not pinned by an active context. Any new content
will be written after HEAD and so the ring will again be valid between
HEAD and TAIL, everything outside can be discarded.

Note that we take care of ensuring that we do not reset the HEAD
backwards following a GPU hang on an idle ring.

The same precautions are what enable us to use stolen memory for rings.
