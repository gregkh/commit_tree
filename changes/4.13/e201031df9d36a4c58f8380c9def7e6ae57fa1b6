[media] cec: stih: allow to use max CEC logical addresses

Hardware could support up to 16 logical addresses which is more
than needed by CEC specifications.
Let use CEC_MAX_LOG_ADDRS instead of limited it on one.
stih_cec_adap_log_addr() function was alredy written to support
multiple addresses requests.
