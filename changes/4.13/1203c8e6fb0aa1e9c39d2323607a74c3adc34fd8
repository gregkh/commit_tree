fault-inject: simplify access check for fail-nth

The fail-nth file is created with 0666 and the access is permitted if
and only if the task is current.

This file is owned by the currnet user.  So we can create it with 0644
and allow the owner to write it.  This enables to watch the status of
task->fail_nth from another processes.
