tcp_bbr: cut pacing rate only if filled pipe

In bbr_set_pacing_rate(), which decides whether to cut the pacing
rate, there was some code that considered exiting STARTUP to be
equivalent to the notion of filling the pipe (i.e.,
bbr_full_bw_reached()). Specifically, as the code was structured,
exiting STARTUP and going into PROBE_RTT could cause us to cut the
pacing rate down to something silly and low, based on whatever
bandwidth samples we've had so far, when it's possible that all of
them have been small app-limited bandwidth samples that are not
representative of the bandwidth available in the path. (The code was
correct at the time it was written, but the state machine changed
without this spot being adjusted correspondingly.)
