gpio-exar/8250-exar: Make set of exported GPIOs configurable

On the SIMATIC, IOT2040 only a single pin is exportable as GPIO, the
rest is required to operate the UART. To allow modeling this case,
expand the platform device data structure to specify a (consecutive) pin
subset for exporting by the gpio-exar driver.
