PCI/MSI: Ignore affinity if pre/post vector count is more than min_vecs

min_vecs is the minimum amount of vectors needed to operate in MSI-X mode
which may just include the vectors that don't need affinity.

Disabling affinity settings causes the qla2xxx driver scsi_add_host() to fail
when blk_mq is enabled as the blk_mq_pci_map_queues() expects affinity masks
on each vector.
