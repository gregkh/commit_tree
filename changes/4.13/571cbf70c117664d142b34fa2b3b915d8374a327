gpu: host1x: Forbid relocation address shifting in the firewall

Incorrectly shifted relocation address will cause a lower memory
corruption and likely a hang on a write or a read of an arbitrary data
in case of IOMMU absence. As of now, there is no known use for the
address shifting and adding a proper shifts / sizes validation is a much
more work. Let's forbid shifts in the firewall till a proper validation
is implemented.
