mmc: block: move multi-ioctl() to use block layer

This switches also the multiple-command ioctl() call to issue
all ioctl()s through the block layer instead of going directly
to the device.

We extend the passed argument with an argument count and loop
over all passed commands in the ioctl() issue function called
from the block layer.

By doing this we are again loosening the grip on the big host
lock, since two calls to mmc_get_card()/mmc_put_card() are
removed.
