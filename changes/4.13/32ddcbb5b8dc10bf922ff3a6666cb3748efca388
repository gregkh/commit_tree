[media] lirc_zilog: Fix whitespace style checks

Fix style issues reported by checkpatch, affecting whitespace only:

 * CHECK: "Please don't use multiple blank lines".
   Two of these still triggering and left untouched because used for
   separating logical blocks (vars from functions, etc.).

 * CHECK: "spaces preferred around that '<operator>'".
   All fixed.

 * CHECK: "Alignment should match open parenthesis".
   All fixed except one on line 1161, left untouched for readability.

Move towards recommended coding style without compromising readability.
