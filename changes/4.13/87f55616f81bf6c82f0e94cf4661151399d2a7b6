iwlwifi: mvm: rs: fix TLC statistics collection

Statistics should be collected according to the actual rate a
frame/aggregation was transmitted and not according to the initial rate
from the last LQ command (these rates are different if the frames were
retransmitted at a lower rate from the rate scale table).

This is needed to remove throughput degradation.
