svcrdma: Use generic RDMA R/W API in RPC Call path

The current svcrdma recvfrom code path has a lot of detail about
registration mode and the type of port (iWARP, IB, etc).

Instead, use the RDMA core's generic R/W API. This shares code with
other RDMA-enabled ULPs that manages the gory details of buffer
registration and the posting of RDMA Read Work Requests.

Since the Read list marshaling code is being replaced, I took the
opportunity to replace C structure-based XDR encoding code with more
portable code that uses pointer arithmetic.
