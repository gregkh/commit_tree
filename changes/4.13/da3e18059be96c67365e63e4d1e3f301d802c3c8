[media] staging: atomisp: Ignore errors from second gpio in ov2680 driver

As the existing comment in the driver indicates the sensor has only 1 pin,
but some boards may have 2 gpios defined and we toggle both as we we don't
know which one is the right one. However if the ACPI resources table
defines only 1 gpio (as expected) the gpio1_ctrl call will always fail,
causing the probing of the driver to file.

This commit ignore the return value of the gpio1_ctrl call, fixing this.
