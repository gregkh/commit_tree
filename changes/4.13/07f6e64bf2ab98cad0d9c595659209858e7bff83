srcu: Make SRCU be once again optional

Commit d160a727c40e ("srcu: Make SRCU be built by default") in response
to build errors, which were caused by code that included srcu.h
despite !SRCU.  However, srcutiny.o is almost 2K of code, which is not
insignificant for those attempting to run the Linux kernel on IoT devices.
This commit therefore makes SRCU be once again optional, and adjusts
srcu.h to allow error-free inclusion in !SRCU kernel builds.
