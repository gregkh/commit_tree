drm/i915: Store i915_gem_object_is_coherent() as a bit next to cache-dirty

For ease of use (i.e. avoiding a few checks and function calls), store
the object's cache coherency next to the cache is dirty bit.

Specifically this patch aims to reduce the frequency of no-op calls to
i915_gem_object_clflush() to counter-act the increase of such calls for
GPU only objects in the previous patch.

v2: Replace cache_dirty & ~cache_coherent with cache_dirty &&
!cache_coherent as gcc generates much better code for the latter
