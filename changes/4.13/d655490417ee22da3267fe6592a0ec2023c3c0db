bpf: allow to specify log level and reduce it for test_verifier

For the test_verifier case, it's quite hard to parse log level 2 to
figure out what's causing an issue when used to log level 1. We do
want to use bpf_verify_program() in order to simulate some of the
tests with strict alignment. So just add an argument to pass the level
and put it to 1 for test_verifier.
