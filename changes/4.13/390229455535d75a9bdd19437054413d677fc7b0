thunderbolt: Do not fail if DROM data CRC32 is invalid

There are devices out there where CRC32 of the DROM is not correct. One
reason for this is that the ICM firmware does not validate it and it
seems that neither does the Apple driver. To be able to support such
devices we continue parsing the DROM contents regardless of whether
CRC32 failed or not. We still keep the warning there.
