rds: tcp: set linger to 1 when unloading a rds-tcp

If we are unloading the rds_tcp module, we can set linger to 1
and drop pending packets to accelerate reconnect. The peer will
end up resetting the connection based on new generation numbers
of the new incarnation, so hanging on to unsent TCP packets via
linger is mostly pointless in this case.
