media: platform: davinci: return -EINVAL for VPFE_CMD_S_CCDC_RAW_PARAMS ioctl

this patch makes sure VPFE_CMD_S_CCDC_RAW_PARAMS ioctl no longer works
for vpfe_capture driver with a minimal patch suitable for backporting.

- This ioctl was never in public api and was only defined in kernel header.
- The function set_params constantly mixes up pointers and phys_addr_t
  numbers.
- This is part of a 'VPFE_CMD_S_CCDC_RAW_PARAMS' ioctl command that is
  described as an 'experimental ioctl that will change in future kernels'.
- The code to allocate the table never gets called after we copy_from_user
  the user input over the kernel settings, and then compare them
  for inequality.
- We then go on to use an address provided by user space as both the
  __user pointer for input and pass it through phys_to_virt to come up
  with a kernel pointer to copy the data to. This looks like a trivially
  exploitable root hole.

Due to these reasons we make sure this ioctl now returns -EINVAL and backport
this patch as far as possible.
