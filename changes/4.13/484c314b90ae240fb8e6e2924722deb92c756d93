iio: light: rpr0521 on-off sequence change for CONFIG_PM

Refactor _set_power_state(), _resume() and _suspend().
Enable measurement only when needed, not in _init(). System can suspend
during measurement and measurement is continued on resume.
Pm turns off measurement when both ps and als measurements are disabled for
2 seconds. During off-time the power save is 20-500mA, typically 180mA.
