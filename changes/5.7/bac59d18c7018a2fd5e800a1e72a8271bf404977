x86/setup: Fix static memory detection

When booting x86 images in qemu, the following warning is seen randomly
if DEBUG_LOCKDEP is enabled.

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1 at kernel/locking/lockdep.c:1119
	  lockdep_register_key+0xc0/0x100

static_obj() returns true if an address is between _stext and _end.

On x86, this includes the brk memory space. Problem is that this memory
block is not static on x86; its unused portions are released after init
and can be allocated. This results in the observed warning if a lockdep
object is allocated from this memory.

Solve the problem by implementing arch_is_kernel_initmem_freed() for
x86 and have it return true if an address is within the released memory
range.

The same problem was solved for s390 with commit

  7a5da02de8d6e ("locking/lockdep: check for freed initmem in static_obj()"),

which introduced arch_is_kernel_initmem_freed().
