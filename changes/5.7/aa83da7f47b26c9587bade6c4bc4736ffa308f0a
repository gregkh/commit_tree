gfs2: More gfs2_find_jhead fixes

It turns out that when extending an existing bio, gfs2_find_jhead fails to
check if the block number is consecutive, which leads to incorrect reads for
fragmented journals.

In addition, limit the maximum bio size to an arbitrary value of 2 megabytes:
since commit 07173c3ec276 ("block: enable multipage bvecs"), if we just keep
adding pages until bio_add_page fails, bios will grow much larger than useful,
which pins more memory than necessary with barely any additional performance
gains.
