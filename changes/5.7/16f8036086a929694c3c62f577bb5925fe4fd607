net: flow_offload: skip hw stats check for FLOW_ACTION_HW_STATS_DONT_CARE

This patch adds FLOW_ACTION_HW_STATS_DONT_CARE which tells the driver
that the frontend does not need counters, this hw stats type request
never fails. The FLOW_ACTION_HW_STATS_DISABLED type explicitly requests
the driver to disable the stats, however, if the driver cannot disable
counters, it bails out.

TCA_ACT_HW_STATS_* maintains the 1:1 mapping with FLOW_ACTION_HW_STATS_*
except by disabled which is mapped to FLOW_ACTION_HW_STATS_DISABLED
(this is 0 in tc). Add tc_act_hw_stats() to perform the mapping between
TCA_ACT_HW_STATS_* and FLOW_ACTION_HW_STATS_*.
