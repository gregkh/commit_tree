bpf: Remove recursion prevention from rcu free callback

If an element is freed via RCU then recursion into BPF instrumentation
functions is not a concern. The element is already detached from the map
and the RCU callback does not hold any locks on which a kprobe, perf event
or tracepoint attached BPF program could deadlock.
