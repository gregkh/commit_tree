kbuild: avoid concurrency issue in parallel building dtbs and dtbs_check

'make dtbs_check' checks the shecma in addition to building *.dtb files,
in other words, 'make dtbs_check' is a super-set of 'make dtbs'.
So, you do not have to do 'make dtbs dtbs_check', but I want to keep
the build system as robust as possible in any use.

Currently, 'dtbs' and 'dtbs_check' are independent of each other.
In parallel building, two threads descend into arch/*/boot/dts/,
one for dtbs and the other for dtbs_check, then end up with building
the same DTB simultaneously.

This commit fixes the concurrency issue. Otherwise, I see build errors
like follows:

$ make ARCH=arm64 defconfig
$ make -j16 ARCH=arm64 DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm/psci.yaml dtbs dtbs_check
