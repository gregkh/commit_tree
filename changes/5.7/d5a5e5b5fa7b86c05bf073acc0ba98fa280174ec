Input: synaptics-rmi4 - really fix attn_data use-after-free

Fix a use-after-free noticed by running with KASAN enabled. If
rmi_irq_fn() is run twice in a row, then rmi_f11_attention() (among
others) will end up reading from drvdata->attn_data.data, which was
freed and left dangling in rmi_irq_fn().

Commit 55edde9fff1a ("Input: synaptics-rmi4 - prevent UAF reported by
KASAN") correctly identified and analyzed this bug. However the attempted
fix only NULLed out a local variable, missing the fact that
drvdata->attn_data is a struct, not a pointer.

NULL out the correct pointer in the driver data to prevent the attention
functions from copying from it.

Fixes: b908d3cd812a ("Input: synaptics-rmi4 - allow to add attention data")
