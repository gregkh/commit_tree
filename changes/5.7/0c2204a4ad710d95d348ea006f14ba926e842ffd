net: qrtr: Migrate nameservice to kernel from userspace

The QRTR nameservice has been maintained in userspace for some time. This
commit migrates it to Linux kernel. This change is required in order to
eliminate the need of starting a userspace daemon for making the WiFi
functional for ath11k based devices. Since the QRTR NS is not usually
packed in most of the distros, users need to clone, build and install it
to get the WiFi working. It will become a hassle when the user doesn't
have any other source of network connectivity.
