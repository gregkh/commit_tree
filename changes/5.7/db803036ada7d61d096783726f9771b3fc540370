umh: fix memory leak on execve failure

If a UMH process created by fork_usermode_blob() fails to execute,
a pair of struct file allocated by umh_pipe_setup() will leak.

Under normal conditions, the caller (like bpfilter) needs to manage the
lifetime of the UMH and its two pipes. But when fork_usermode_blob()
fails, the caller doesn't really have a way to know what needs to be
done. It seems better to do the cleanup ourselves in this case.
