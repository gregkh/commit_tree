x86/Hyper-V: Report crash data in die() when panic_on_oops is set

When oops happens with panic_on_oops unset, the oops
thread is killed by die() and system continues to run.
In such case, guest should not report crash register
data to host since system still runs. Check panic_on_oops
and return directly in hyperv_report_panic() when the function
is called in the die() and panic_on_oops is unset. Fix it.
