gpu/drm: Ingenic: Fix opaque pointer casted to wrong type

The opaque pointer passed to the IRQ handler is a pointer to the
drm_device, not a pointer to our ingenic_drm structure.

It still worked, because our ingenic_drm structure contains the
drm_device as its first field, so the pointer received had the same
value, but this was not semantically correct.
