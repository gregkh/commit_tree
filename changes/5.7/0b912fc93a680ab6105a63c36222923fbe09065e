net: dsa: felix: support changing the MTU

Changing the MTU for this switch means altering the
DEV_GMII:MAC_CFG_STATUS:MAC_MAXLEN_CFG field MAX_LEN, which in turn
limits the size of frames that can be received.

Special accounting needs to be done for the DSA CPU port (NPI port in
hardware terms). The NPI port configuration needs to be held inside the
private ocelot structure, since it is now accessed from multiple places.
