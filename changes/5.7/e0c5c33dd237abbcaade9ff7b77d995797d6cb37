MAINTAINERS: Update URL for wireless drivers

Previously, http://wireless.kernel.org would redirect to
https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org, however, this is no longer the case
and most pages return 404.

https is used because http://wireless.kernel.org/* redirects to
https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/*
