scsi: sr: remove references to BLK_DEV_SR_VENDOR, leave it enabled

This kernel configuration is basically enabling/disabling sr driver quirks
detection. While these quirks are for fairly rare devices (very old CD
burners, and a glucometer), the additional detection of these models is a
very minimal amount of code.

The logic behind the quirks is always built into the sr driver.

This also removes the config from all the defconfig files that are enabling
this already.
