drop_monitor: work around gcc-10 stringop-overflow warning

The current gcc-10 snapshot produces a false-positive warning:

net/core/drop_monitor.c: In function 'trace_drop_common.constprop':
cc1: error: writing 8 bytes into a region of size 0 [-Werror=stringop-overflow=]
In file included from net/core/drop_monitor.c:23:
include/uapi/linux/net_dropmon.h:36:8: note: at offset 0 to object 'entries' with size 4 declared here
   36 |  __u32 entries;
      |        ^~~~~~~

I reported this in the gcc bugzilla, but in case it does not get
fixed in the release, work around it by using a temporary variable.
