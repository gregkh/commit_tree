task_work_run: don't take ->pi_lock unconditionally

As Peter pointed out, task_work() can avoid ->pi_lock and cmpxchg()
if task->task_works == NULL && !PF_EXITING.

And in fact the only reason why task_work_run() needs ->pi_lock is
the possible race with task_work_cancel(), we can optimize this code
and make the locking more clear.
