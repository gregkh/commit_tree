media: tvp5150: add support to limit sdtv standards

The tvp5150 accepts NTSC(M,J,4.43), PAL (B,D,G,H,I,M,N) and SECAM video
data and is able to auto-detect the input signal. The auto-detection
does not work if the connector does not receive an input signal and the
tvp5150 might not be configured correctly. This misconfiguration leads
into wrong decoded video streams if the tvp5150 gets powered on before
the video signal is present.

Limit the supported sdtv standards according to the actual selected
connector to avoid a misconfiguration.
