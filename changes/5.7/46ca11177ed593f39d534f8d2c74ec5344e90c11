selftests: mlxsw: qos_mc_aware: Specify arping timeout as an integer

Starting from iputils s20190709 (used in Fedora 31), arping does not
support timeout being specified as a decimal:

$ arping -c 1 -I swp1 -b 192.0.2.66 -q -w 0.1
arping: invalid argument: '0.1'

Previously, such timeouts were rounded to an integer.

Fix this by specifying the timeout as an integer.
