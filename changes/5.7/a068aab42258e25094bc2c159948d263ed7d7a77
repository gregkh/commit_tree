bonding: Fix reference count leak in bond_sysfs_slave_add.

kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails.
If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to
properly clean up the memory associated with the object. Previous
commit "b8eb718348b8" fixed a similar problem.

Fixes: 07699f9a7c8d ("bonding: add sysfs /slave dir for bond slave devices.")
