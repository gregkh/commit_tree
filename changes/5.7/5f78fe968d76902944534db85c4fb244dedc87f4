net/smc: simplify normal link termination

smc_lgr_terminate() and smc_lgr_terminate_sched() both result in soft
link termination, smc_lgr_terminate_sched() is scheduling a worker for
this task. Take out complexity by always using the termination worker
and getting rid of smc_lgr_terminate() completely.
