mptcp: set correct vfs info for subflows

When a subflow is created via mptcp_subflow_create_socket(),
a new 'struct socket' is allocated, with a new i_ino value.

When inspecting TCP sockets via the procfs and or the diag
interface, the above ones are not related to the process owning
the MPTCP master socket, even if they are a logical part of it
('ss -p' shows an empty process field)

Additionally, subflows created by the path manager get
the uid/gid from the running workqueue.

Subflows are part of the owning MPTCP master socket, let's
adjust the vfs info to reflect this.

After this patch, 'ss' correctly displays subflows as belonging
to the msk socket creator.
