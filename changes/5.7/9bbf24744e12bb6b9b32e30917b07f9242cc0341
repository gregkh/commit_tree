KVM: selftests: Add support for vcpu_args_set to aarch64 and s390x

Currently vcpu_args_set is only implemented for x86. This makes writing
tests with multiple vCPUs difficult as each guest vCPU must either a.)
do the same thing or b.) derive some kind of unique token from it's
registers or the architecture. To simplify the process of writing tests
with multiple vCPUs for s390 and aarch64, add set args functions for
those architectures.
