mm/Makefile: disable KCSAN for kmemleak

Kmemleak could scan task stacks while plain writes happens to those stack
variables which could results in data races.  For example, in
sys_rt_sigaction and do_sigaction(), it could have plain writes in a
32-byte size.  Since the kmemleak does not care about the actual values of
a non-pointer and all do_sigaction() call sites only copy to stack
variables, just disable KCSAN for kmemleak to avoid annotating anything
outside Kmemleak just because Kmemleak scans everything.
