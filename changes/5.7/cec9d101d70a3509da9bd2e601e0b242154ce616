clk: rockchip: fix incorrect configuration of rk3228 aclk_gpu* clocks

The following changes prevent the unrecoverable freezes and rcu_sched
stall warnings experienced in each of my attempts to take advantage of
lima.

Replace the COMPOSITE_NOGATE definition of aclk_gpu_pre with a
COMPOSITE that retains the selection of HDMIPHY as the PLL source, but
instead makes uses of the aclk_gpu PLL source gate and parent names
defined by mux_pll_src_4plls_p rather than mux_aclk_gpu_pre_p.

Remove the now unused mux_aclk_gpu_pre_p and the four named but also
unused definitions (cpll_gpu, gpll_gpu, hdmiphy_gpu and usb480m_gpu)
of the aclk_gpu PLL source gate.

Use the correct gate offset for aclk_gpu and aclk_gpu_noc.
