pie: remove pie_vars->accu_prob_overflows

The variable pie_vars->accu_prob is used as an accumulator for
probability values. Since probabilty values are scaled using the
MAX_PROB macro denoting (2^64 - 1), pie_vars->accu_prob is
likely to overflow as it is of type u64.

The variable pie_vars->accu_prob_overflows counts the number of
times the variable pie_vars->accu_prob overflows.

The MAX_PROB macro needs to be equal to at least (2^39 - 1) in
order to do precise calculations without any underflow. Thus
MAX_PROB can be reduced to (2^56 - 1) without affecting the
precision in calculations drastically. Doing so will eliminate
the need for the variable pie_vars->accu_prob_overflows as the
variable pie_vars->accu_prob will never overflow.

Removing the variable pie_vars->accu_prob_overflows also reduces
the size of the structure pie_vars to exactly 64 bytes.
