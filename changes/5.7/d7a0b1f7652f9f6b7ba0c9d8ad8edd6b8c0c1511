net: dsa: b53: Restore VLAN entries upon (re)configuration

The first time b53_configure_vlan() is called we have not configured any
VLAN entries yet, since that happens later when interfaces get brought
up. When b53_configure_vlan() is called again from suspend/resume we
need to restore all VLAN entries though.
