xfs: factor inode lookup from xfs_ifree_cluster

There's lots of indent in this code which makes it a bit hard to
follow. We are also going to completely rework the inode lookup code
as part of the inode reclaim rework, so factor out the inode lookup
code from the inode cluster freeing code.

Based on prototype code from Christoph Hellwig.
