io_uring: remove extra nxt check after punt

After __io_queue_sqe() ended up in io_queue_async_work(), it's already
known that there is no @nxt req, so skip the check and return from the
function.

Also, @nxt initialisation now can be done just before
io_put_req_find_next(), as there is no jumping until it's checked.
