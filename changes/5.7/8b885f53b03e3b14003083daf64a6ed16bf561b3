mm/page_alloc: make pcpu_drain_mutex and pcpu_drain static

Fix the following sparse warning:

  mm/page_alloc.c:106:1: warning: symbol 'pcpu_drain_mutex' was not declared. Should it be static?
  mm/page_alloc.c:107:1: warning: symbol '__pcpu_scope_pcpu_drain' was not declared. Should it be static?
