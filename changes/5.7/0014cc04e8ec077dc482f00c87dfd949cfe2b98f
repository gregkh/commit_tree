ima: Set file->f_mode instead of file->f_flags in ima_calc_file_hash()

Commit a408e4a86b36 ("ima: open a new file instance if no read
permissions") tries to create a new file descriptor to calculate a file
digest if the file has not been opened with O_RDONLY flag. However, if a
new file descriptor cannot be obtained, it sets the FMODE_READ flag to
file->f_flags instead of file->f_mode.

This patch fixes this issue by replacing f_flags with f_mode as it was
before that commit.
