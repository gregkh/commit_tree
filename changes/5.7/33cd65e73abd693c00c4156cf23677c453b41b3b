kasan: disable branch tracing for core runtime

During early boot, while KASAN is not yet initialized, it is possible to
enter reporting code-path and end up in kasan_report().

While uninitialized, the branch there prevents generating any reports,
however, under certain circumstances when branches are being traced
(TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING), we may recurse deep enough to cause kernel
reboots without warning.

To prevent similar issues in future, we should disable branch tracing
for the core runtime.

[elver@google.com: remove duplicate DISABLE_BRANCH_PROFILING, per Qian Cai]
