drm/i915/gem: Take a copy of the engines for context_barrier_task

When applying the context-barrier, we only care about the current
engines, as the next set of engines will be naturally after the barrier.
So we can skip holding the ctx->engines_mutex while constructing the
request by taking a sneaky reference to the i915_gem_engines instead.
