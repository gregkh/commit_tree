hinic: fix a bug of ndo_stop

if some function in ndo_stop interface returns failure because of
hardware fault, must go on excuting rest steps rather than return
failure directly, otherwise will cause memory leak.And bump the
timeout for SET_FUNC_STATE to ensure that cmd won't return failure
when hw is busy. Otherwise hw may stomp host memory if we free
memory regardless of the return value of SET_FUNC_STATE.
