drm/i915: Polish CHV .load_luts() a bit

It irks me to use crtc_state_is_legacy_gamma() inside the guts
of the CHV color management code. Let's get rid of it and instead
just consult cgm_mode to figure out if we want to enable the pipe
gamma or the CGM gamma.

Also CHV display engine is based on i965/g4x so we should fall back
to the i965 path when the CGM gamma is not used.
