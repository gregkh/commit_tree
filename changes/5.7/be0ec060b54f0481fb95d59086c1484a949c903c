ARM: dts: bcm: HR2: Fix PPI interrupt types

These error messages are output when booting on a BCM HR2 system:
    GIC: PPI11 is secure or misconfigured
    GIC: PPI13 is secure or misconfigured

Per ARM documentation these interrupts are triggered on a rising edge.
See ARM Cortex A-9 MPCore Technical Reference Manual, Revision r4p1,
Section 3.3.8 Interrupt Configuration Registers.

The same issue was resolved for NSP systems in commit 5f1aa51c7a1e
("ARM: dts: NSP: Fix PPI interrupt types").
