drm/i915: Keep track of request among the scheduling lists

If we keep track of when the i915_request.sched.link is on the HW
runlist, or in the priority queue we can simplify our interactions with
the request (such as during rescheduling). This also simplifies the next
patch where we introduce a new in-between list, for requests that are
ready but neither on the run list or in the queue.

v2: Update i915_sched_node.link explanation for current usage where it
is a link on both the queue and on the runlists.
