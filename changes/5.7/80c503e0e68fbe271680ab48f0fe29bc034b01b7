locktorture: Print ratio of acquisitions, not failures

The __torture_print_stats() function in locktorture.c carefully
initializes local variable "min" to statp[0].n_lock_acquired, but
then compares it to statp[i].n_lock_fail.  Given that the .n_lock_fail
field should normally be zero, and given the initialization, it seems
reasonable to display the maximum and minimum number acquisitions
instead of miscomputing the maximum and minimum number of failures.
This commit therefore switches from failures to acquisitions.

And this turns out to be not only a day-zero bug, but entirely my
own fault.  I hate it when that happens!
