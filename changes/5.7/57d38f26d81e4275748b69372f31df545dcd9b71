vt: fix unicode console freeing with a common interface

By directly using kfree() in different places we risk missing one if
it is switched to using vfree(), especially if the corresponding
vmalloc() is hidden away within a common abstraction.

Oh wait, that's exactly what happened here.

So let's fix this by creating a common abstraction for the free case
as well.
