ipv4: nexthop version of fib_info_nh_uses_dev

Similar to the last path, need to fix fib_info_nh_uses_dev for
external nexthops to avoid referencing multiple nh_grp structs.
Move the device check in fib_info_nh_uses_dev to a helper and
create a nexthop version that is called if the fib_info uses an
external nexthop.
