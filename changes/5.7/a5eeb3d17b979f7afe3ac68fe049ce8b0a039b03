btrfs: add helper to get the end offset of a file extent item

Getting the end offset for a file extent item requires a bit of code since
the extent can be either inline or regular/prealloc. There are some places
all over the code base that open code this logic and in another patch
later in this series it will be needed again. Therefore encapsulate this
logic in a helper function and use it.
