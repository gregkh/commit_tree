rcutorture: Add 100-CPU configuration

The small-system rcutorture configurations have served us well for a great
many years, but it is now time to add a larger one.  This commit does
just that, but does not add it to the defaults in CFLIST.  This allows
the kvm.sh argument '--configs "4*CFLIST TREE10" to run four instances
of each of the default configurations concurrently with one instance of
the large configuration.
