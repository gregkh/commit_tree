usb: dwc3: Rework resets initialization to be more flexible

The dwc3 core binding specifies one reset.

However some variants of the hardware may have more. Previously
this was handled by using the dwc3-of-simple glue driver, but
that resulted in a proliferation of bindings for for every
variant, when the only difference was the clocks and resets
lists.

So this patch reworks the reading of the resets to fetch all the
resets specified in the dts together.

This patch was recommended by Rob Herring <robh@kernel.org>
as an alternative to creating multiple bindings for each variant
of hardware.
