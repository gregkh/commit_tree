rcutorture: Add READ_ONCE() to rcu_torture_count and rcu_torture_batch

The rcutorture rcu_torture_count and rcu_torture_batch per-CPU variables
are read locklessly, so this commit adds the READ_ONCE() to a load in
order to avoid various types of compiler vandalism^Woptimization.

This data race was reported by KCSAN. Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely and due to this being rcutorture.
