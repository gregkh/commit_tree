sfc: ethtool: Refactor to remove fallthrough comments in case blocks

Converting fallthrough comments to fallthrough; creates warnings
in this code when compiled with gcc.

This code is overly complicated and reads rather better with a
little refactoring and no fallthrough uses at all.

Remove the fallthrough comments and simplify the written source
code while reducing the object code size.

Consolidate duplicated switch/case blocks for IPV4 and IPV6.
