powerpc/bpf: Enable bpf_probe_read{, str}() on powerpc again

The commit 0ebeea8ca8a4d1d453a ("bpf: Restrict bpf_probe_read{, str}() only
to archs where they work") caused that bpf_probe_read{, str}() functions
were not longer available on architectures where the same logical address
might have different content in kernel and user memory mapping. These
architectures should use probe_read_{user,kernel}_str helpers.

For backward compatibility, the problematic functions are still available
on architectures where the user and kernel address spaces are not
overlapping. This is defined CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_NON_OVERLAPPING_ADDRESS_SPACE.

At the moment, these backward compatible functions are enabled only on x86_64,
arm, and arm64. Let's do it also on powerpc that has the non overlapping
address space as well.
