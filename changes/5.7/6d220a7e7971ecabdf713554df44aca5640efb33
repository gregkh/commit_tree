drm/amdkfd: Add queue information to sysfs

Provide compute queues information in sysfs under /sys/class/kfd/kfd/proc.
The format is /sys/class/kfd/kfd/proc/<pid>/queues/<queue id>/XX where
XX are size, type, and gpuid three files to represent queue size, queue
type, and the GPU this queue uses. <queue id> folder and files underneath
are generated when a queue is created. They are removed when the queue is
destroyed.
