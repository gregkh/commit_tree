arm64: cpufeature: handle conflicts based on capability

Each system capability can be of either boot, local, or system scope,
depending on when the state of the capability is finalized. When we
detect a conflict on a late CPU, we either offline the CPU or panic the
system. We currently always panic if the conflict is caused by a boot
scope capability, and offline the CPU if the conflict is caused by a
local or system scope capability.

We're going to want to add a new capability (for pointer authentication)
which needs to be boot scope but doesn't need to panic the system when a
conflict is detected. So add a new flag to specify whether the
capability requires the system to panic or not. Current boot scope
capabilities are updated to set the flag, so there should be no
functional change as a result of this patch.
