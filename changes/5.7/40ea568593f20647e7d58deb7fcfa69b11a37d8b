thermal/drivers/cpufreq_cooling: Remove abusing WARN_ON

The WARN_ON macros are used at the entry functions state2power() and
set_cur_state().

state2power() is called with the max_state retrieved from
get_max_state which returns cpufreq_cdev->max_level, then it check if
max_state is > cpufreq_cdev->max_level. The test does not really makes
sense but let's assume we want to make sure to catch an error if the
code evolves. However the WARN_ON is overkill.

set_cur_state() is also called from userspace if we write to the
sysfs. It is easy to see a stack dumped by just writing to sysfs
/sys/class/thermal/cooling_device0/cur_state a value greater than
"max_level". A bit scary. Returing -EINVAL is enough.

Remove these WARN_ON.
