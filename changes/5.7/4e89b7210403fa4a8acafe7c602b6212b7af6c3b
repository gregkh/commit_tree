fix multiplication overflow in copy_fdtable()

cpy and set really should be size_t; we won't get an overflow on that,
since sysctl_nr_open can't be set above ~(size_t)0 / sizeof(void *),
so nr that would've managed to overflow size_t on that multiplication
won't get anywhere near copy_fdtable() - we'll fail with EMFILE
before that.
