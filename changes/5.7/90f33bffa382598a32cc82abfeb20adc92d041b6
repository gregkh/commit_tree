nexthops: don't modify published nexthop groups

We must avoid modifying published nexthop groups while they might be
in use, otherwise we might see NULL ptr dereferences. In order to do
that we allocate 2 nexthoup group structures upon nexthop creation
and swap between them when we have to delete an entry. The reason is
that we can't fail nexthop group removal, so we can't handle allocation
failure thus we move the extra allocation on creation where we can
safely fail and return ENOMEM.
