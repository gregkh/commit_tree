selftests/vm: fix map_hugetlb length used for testing read and write

Commit fa7b9a805c79 ("tools/selftest/vm: allow choosing mem size and page
size in map_hugetlb") added the possibility to change the size of memory
mapped for the test, but left the read and write test using the default
value.  This is unnoticed when mapping a length greater than the default
one, but segfaults otherwise.

Fix read_bytes() and write_bytes() by giving them the real length.

Also fix the call to munmap().
