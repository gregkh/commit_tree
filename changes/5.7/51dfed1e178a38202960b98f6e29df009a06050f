ASoC: SOF: Intel: add SoundWire configuration interface

Now that the SoundWire core supports the multi-step initialization,
call the relevant APIs.

The actual hardware enablement can be done in two places, ideally we'd
want to startup the SoundWire IP as soon as possible (while still
taking power rail dependencies into account)

However when suspend/resume is implemented, the DSP device will be
resumed first, and only when the DSP firmware is downloaded/booted
would the SoundWire child devices be resumed, so there are only
marginal benefits in starting the IP earlier for the first probe.
