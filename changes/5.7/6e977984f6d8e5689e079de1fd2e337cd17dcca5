KVM: arm64: Save/restore sp_el0 as part of __guest_enter

We currently save/restore sp_el0 in C code. This is a bit unsafe,
as a lot of the C code expects 'current' to be accessible from
there (and the opportunity to run kernel code in HYP is specially
great with VHE).

Instead, let's move the save/restore of sp_el0 to the assembly
code (in __guest_enter), making sure that sp_el0 is correct
very early on when we exit the guest, and is preserved as long
as possible to its host value when we enter the guest.
