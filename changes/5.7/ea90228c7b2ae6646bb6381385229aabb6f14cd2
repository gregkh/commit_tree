iommu/amd: Fix get_acpihid_device_id()

acpi_dev_hid_uid_match() expects a null pointer for UID if it doesn't
exist. The acpihid_map_entry contains a char buffer for holding the
UID. If no UID was provided in the IVRS table, this buffer will be
zeroed. If we pass in a null string, acpi_dev_hid_uid_match() will
return false because it will try and match an empty string to the ACPI
UID of the device.
