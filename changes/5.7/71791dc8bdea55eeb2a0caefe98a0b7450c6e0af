net: axienet: Check for DMA mapping errors

Especially with the default 32-bit DMA mask, DMA buffers are a limited
resource, so their allocation can fail.
So as the DMA API documentation requires, add error checking code after
dma_map_single() calls to catch the case where we run out of "low" memory.
