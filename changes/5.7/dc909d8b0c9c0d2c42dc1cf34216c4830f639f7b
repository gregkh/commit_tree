powerpc/numa: Early request for home node associativity

Currently the kernel detects if its running on a shared lpar platform
and requests home node associativity before the scheduler sched_domains
are setup. However between the time NUMA setup is initialized and the
request for home node associativity, workqueue initializes its per node
cpumask. The per node workqueue possible cpumask may turn invalid
after home node associativity resulting in weird situations like
workqueue possible cpumask being a subset of workqueue online cpumask.

This can be fixed by requesting home node associativity earlier just
before NUMA setup. However at the NUMA setup time, kernel may not be in
a position to detect if its running on a shared lpar platform. So
request for home node associativity and if the request fails, fallback
on the device tree property.
