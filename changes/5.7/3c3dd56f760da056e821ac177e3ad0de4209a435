i2c: fix missing pm_runtime_put_sync in i2c_device_probe

In case of the I2C client exposes the flag I2C_CLIENT_HOST_NOTIFY,
pm_runtime_get_sync is called in order to always keep active the
adapter. However later on, pm_runtime_put_sync is never called
within the function in case of an error. This commit add this
error handling.
