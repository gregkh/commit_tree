net: ipv4: really enforce backoff for redirects

In commit b406472b5ad7 ("net: ipv4: avoid mixed n_redirects and
rate_tokens usage") I missed the fact that a 0 'rate_tokens' will
bypass the backoff algorithm.

Since rate_tokens is cleared after a redirect silence, and never
incremented on redirects, if the host keeps receiving packets
requiring redirect it will reply ignoring the backoff.

Additionally, the 'rate_last' field will be updated with the
cadence of the ingress packet requiring redirect. If that rate is
high enough, that will prevent the host from generating any
other kind of ICMP messages

The check for a zero 'rate_tokens' value was likely a shortcut
to avoid the more complex backoff algorithm after a redirect
silence period. Address the issue checking for 'n_redirects'
instead, which is incremented on successful redirect, and
does not interfere with other ICMP replies.
