afs: Don't unlock fetched data pages until the op completes successfully

Don't call req->page_done() on each page as we finish filling it with
the data coming from the network.  Whilst this might speed up the
application a bit, it's a problem if there's a network failure and the
operation has to be reissued.

If this happens, an oops occurs because afs_readpages_page_done() clears
the pointer to each page it unlocks and when a retry happens, the
pointers to the pages it wants to fill are now NULL (and the pages have
been unlocked anyway).

Instead, wait till the operation completes successfully and only then
release all the pages after clearing any terminal gap (the server can
give us less data than we requested as we're allowed to ask for more
than is available).

KASAN produces a bug like the following, and even without KASAN, it can
oops and panic.
