KVM: SVM: keep DR6 synchronized with vcpu->arch.dr6

kvm_x86_ops.set_dr6 is only ever called with vcpu->arch.dr6 as the
second argument.  Ensure that the VMCB value is synchronized to
vcpu->arch.dr6 on #DB (both "normal" and nested) and nested vmentry, so
that the current value of DR6 is always available in vcpu->arch.dr6.
The get_dr6 callback can just access vcpu->arch.dr6 and becomes redundant.
