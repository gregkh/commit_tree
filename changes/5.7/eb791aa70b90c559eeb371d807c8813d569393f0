iommu/amd: Fix race in increase_address_space()/fetch_pte()

The 'pt_root' and 'mode' struct members of 'struct protection_domain'
need to be get/set atomically, otherwise the page-table of the domain
can get corrupted.

Merge the fields into one atomic64_t struct member which can be
get/set atomically.
