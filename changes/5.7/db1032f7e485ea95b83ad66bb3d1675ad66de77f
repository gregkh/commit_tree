tty: n_tracesink: Use the correct style for SPDX License Identifier

This patch corrects the SPDX License Identifier style in
header file related to Kernel driver API to route trace data.
For C header files Documentation/process/license-rules.rst
mandates C-like comments (opposed to C source files where
C++ style should be used).
