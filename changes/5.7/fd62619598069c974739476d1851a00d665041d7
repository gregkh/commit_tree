efi/libstub/x86: Avoid EFI map buffer alloc in allocate_e820()

In allocate_e820(), call the EFI get_memory_map() service directly
instead of indirectly via efi_get_memory_map(). This avoids allocation
of a buffer and return of the full EFI memory map, which is not needed
here and would otherwise need to be freed.

Routine allocate_e820() only needs to know how many EFI memory
descriptors there are in the map to allocate an adequately sized
e820ext buffer, if it's needed. Note that since efi_get_memory_map()
returns a memory map buffer sized with extra headroom, allocate_e820()
now needs to explicitly factor that into the e820ext size calculation.
