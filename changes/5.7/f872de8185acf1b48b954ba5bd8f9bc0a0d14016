batman-adv: Fix refcnt leak in batadv_show_throughput_override

batadv_show_throughput_override() invokes batadv_hardif_get_by_netdev(),
which gets a batadv_hard_iface object from net_dev with increased refcnt
and its reference is assigned to a local pointer 'hard_iface'.

When batadv_show_throughput_override() returns, "hard_iface" becomes
invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.

The issue happens in the normal path of
batadv_show_throughput_override(), which forgets to decrease the refcnt
increased by batadv_hardif_get_by_netdev() before the function returns,
causing a refcnt leak.

Fix this issue by calling batadv_hardif_put() before the
batadv_show_throughput_override() returns in the normal path.
