sched/fair: Don't NUMA balance for kthreads

Stefano reported a crash with using SQPOLL with io_uring:

  BUG: kernel NULL pointer dereference, address: 00000000000003b0
  CPU: 2 PID: 1307 Comm: io_uring-sq Not tainted 5.7.0-rc7 #11
  RIP: 0010:task_numa_work+0x4f/0x2c0
  Call Trace:
   task_work_run+0x68/0xa0
   io_sq_thread+0x252/0x3d0
   kthread+0xf9/0x130
   ret_from_fork+0x35/0x40

which is task_numa_work() oopsing on current->mm being NULL.

The task work is queued by task_tick_numa(), which checks if current->mm is
NULL at the time of the call. But this state isn't necessarily persistent,
if the kthread is using use_mm() to temporarily adopt the mm of a task.

Change the task_tick_numa() check to exclude kernel threads in general,
as it doesn't make sense to attempt ot balance for kthreads anyway.
