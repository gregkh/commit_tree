arm64: perf: Support new DT compatibles

Add support for matching the new PMUs. For now, this just wires them up
as generic PMUv3 such that people writing DTs for new SoCs can do the
right thing, and at least have architectural and raw events be usable.
We can come back and fill in event maps for sysfs and/or perf tools at
a later date.
