ARM: tegra: Remove pen-locking from cpuidle-tegra20

Pen-locking is meant to block CPU0 if CPU1 wakes up during of entering
into LP2 because of some interrupt firing up, preventing unnecessary LP2
enter that will be resumed immediately. Apparently this case doesn't
happen often in practice, I checked how often it takes place and found
that after ~20 hours of browsing web, managing email, watching videos and
idling (15+ hours) there is only a dozen of early LP2 entering abortions
and they all happened while device was idling. Thus let's remove the
pen-locking and make LP2 entering uninterruptible, simplifying code quite
a lot. This will also become very handy for the upcoming unified cpuidle
driver, allowing to have a common LP2 code-path across of different
hardware generations.
