mptcp: Initialize map_seq upon subflow establishment

When the other MPTCP-peer uses 32-bit data-sequence numbers, we rely on
map_seq to indicate how to expand to a 64-bit data-sequence number in
expand_seq() when receiving data.

For new subflows, this field is not initialized, thus results in an
"invalid" mapping being discarded.

Fix this by initializing map_seq upon subflow establishment time.
