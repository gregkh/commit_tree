soundwire: stream: don't program ports when a stream that has not been prepared

In the Intel QA multi-pipelines test case, there are two pipelines for
playback and capture on the same bus. The test fails with an error
when setting port params:

[  599.224812] rt711 sdw:0:25d:711:0: invalid dpn_prop direction 1 port_num 0
[  599.224815] sdw_program_slave_port_params failed -22
[  599.224819] intel-sdw sdw-master-0: Program transport params failed: -22
[  599.224822] intel-sdw sdw-master-0: Program params failed: -22
[  599.224828] sdw_enable_stream: SDW0 Pin2-Playback: done

This problem is root-caused to the programming of the capture stream
ports while it is not yet prepared, the calling sequence is:

(1) hw_params for playback. The playback stream provide the port
    information to Bus.
(2) stream_prepare for playback, Transport and port parameters
    are computed for playback.
(3) hw_params for capture. The capture stream provide the port
    information to Bus, but it has not been prepared so is not
    accounted for in the bandwidth allocation.
(4) stream_enable for playback. Program transport and port parameters
    for all masters and slaves. Since the transport and port parameters
    are not computed for capture stream, sdw_program_slave_port_params
    will generate a error when setting port params for capture.

in step (4), we should only program the ports for the stream that have
been prepared. A stream that is only in CONFIGURED state should be
ignored, its ports will be programmed when it becomes PREPARED.

Tested on Comet Lake.
