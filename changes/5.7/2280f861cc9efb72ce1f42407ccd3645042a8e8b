ARM: dts: rockchip: add sram to bus_intmem nodename for rk3288

A test with the command below gives for example these errors:

arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3288-evb-act8846.dt.yaml:
bus_intmem@ff700000: $nodename:0: 'bus_intmem@ff700000'
does not match '^sram(@.*)?'
arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3288-evb-rk808.dt.yaml:
bus_intmem@ff700000: $nodename:0: 'bus_intmem@ff700000'
does not match '^sram(@.*)?'

'rockchip-pmu-sram.txt' inherit properties from 'sram.yaml'.
Fix this error by adding 'sram' to the bus_intmem nodename
in 'rk3288.dtsi'. But 'sram' is also a node name already in use.
To prevent confusion rename it to 'pmu_sram'.
