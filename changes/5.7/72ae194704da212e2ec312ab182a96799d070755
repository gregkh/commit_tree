xhci: bail out early if driver can't accress host in resume

Bail out early if the xHC host needs to be reset at resume
but driver can't access xHC PCI registers.

If xhci driver already fails to reset the controller then there
is no point in attempting to free, re-initialize, re-allocate and
re-start the host. If failure to access the host is detected later,
failing the resume, xhci interrupts will be double freed
when remove is called.
