userfaultfd: wp: support swap and page migration

For either swap and page migration, we all use the bit 2 of the entry to
identify whether this entry is uffd write-protected.  It plays a similar
role as the existing soft dirty bit in swap entries but only for keeping
the uffd-wp tracking for a specific PTE/PMD.

Something special here is that when we want to recover the uffd-wp bit
from a swap/migration entry to the PTE bit we'll also need to take care of
the _PAGE_RW bit and make sure it's cleared, otherwise even with the
_PAGE_UFFD_WP bit we can't trap it at all.

In change_pte_range() we do nothing for uffd if the PTE is a swap entry.
That can lead to data mismatch if the page that we are going to write
protect is swapped out when sending the UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT.  This patch
also applies/removes the uffd-wp bit even for the swap entries.
