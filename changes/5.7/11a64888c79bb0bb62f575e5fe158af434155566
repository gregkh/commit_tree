rtw88: 8822c: config RF table path B before path A

After MAC switched power, the hardware's RF registers will have
its default value, but the default value for path B is incorrect.
So, load RF path B first, to decrease the period between MAC on
and RF path B config.

By test, if we load path A first, then there's ~300ms that the
path B is incorrect, it could lead to BT coex's A2DP glitch.
But if we configure path B first, there will only have ~3ms,
significantly lower possibility to have A2DP sound glitch.
