slub: avoid redzone when choosing freepointer location

Marco Elver reported system crashes when booting with "slub_debug=Z".

The freepointer location (s->offset) was not taking into account that
the "inuse" size that includes the redzone area should not be used by
the freelist pointer.  Change the calculation to save the area of the
object that an inline freepointer may be written into.

Fixes: 3202fa62fb43 ("slub: relocate freelist pointer to middle of object")
