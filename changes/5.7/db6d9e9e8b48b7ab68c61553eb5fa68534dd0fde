mac80211: Fix setting txpower to zero

With multiple VIFS ath10k, and probably others, tries to find the
minimum txpower for all vifs and uses that when setting txpower in
the firmware.

If a second vif is added and starts to scan, it's txpower is not
initialized yet and it set to zero.

ath10k had a patch to ignore zero values, but then it is impossible
to actually set txpower to zero.

So, instead initialize the txpower to INT_MIN in mac80211, and let
drivers know that means the power has not been set and so should
be ignored.

This should fix regression in:
