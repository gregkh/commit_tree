ASoC: Intel: boards: add sof_sdw machine driver

This machine driver provides support for different configurations:

RT700, RT711, RT1308 (1x and 2x, I2S or SoundWire mode), and RT715
CometLake, Icelake, TigerLake.
PDM digital microphones
HDMI

To avoid introducing one driver per configuration, this common machine
driver relies on platform-specific information, tables and quirks to
dynamically create the relevant dailinks.

Unlike a lot of machine drivers, we use different DAI links for
SoundWire capture and playback since the Cadence PDIs can do capture
OR playback, not both simultaneously.

For each configuration, the card component string is updated so that UCM
can select the relevant parts.
