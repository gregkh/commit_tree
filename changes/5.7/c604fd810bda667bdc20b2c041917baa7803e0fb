arm64: dts: rockchip: swap interrupts interrupt-names rk3399 gpu node

Dts files with Rockchip rk3399 'gpu' nodes were manually verified.
In order to automate this process arm,mali-midgard.txt
has been converted to yaml. In the new setup dtbs_check with
arm,mali-midgard.yaml expects interrupts and interrupt-names values
in the same order. Fix this for rk3399.

make ARCH=arm64 dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/gpu/
arm,mali-midgard.yaml
