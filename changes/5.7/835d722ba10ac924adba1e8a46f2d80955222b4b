coresight: cti: Initial CoreSight CTI Driver

This introduces a baseline CTI driver and associated configuration files.

Uses the platform agnostic naming standard for CoreSight devices, along
with a generic platform probing method that currently supports device
tree descriptions, but allows for the ACPI bindings to be added once these
have been defined for the CTI devices.

Driver will probe for the device on the AMBA bus, and load the CTI driver
on CoreSight ID match to CTI IDs in tables.

Initial sysfs support for enable / disable provided.

Default CTI interconnection data is generated based on hardware
register signal counts, with no additional connection information.
