PM / Domains: Allow no domain-idle-states DT property in genpd when parsing

Commit 2c361684803e ("PM / Domains: Don't treat zero found compatible idle
states as an error"), moved of_genpd_parse_idle_states() towards allowing
none compatible idle state to be found for the device node, rather than
returning an error code.

However, it didn't consider that the "domain-idle-states" DT property may
be missing as it's optional, which makes of_count_phandle_with_args() to
return -ENOENT. Let's fix this to make the behaviour consistent.
