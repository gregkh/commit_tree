lockdep: Add hrtimer context tracing bits

Set current->irq_config = 1 for hrtimers which are not marked to expire in
hard interrupt context during hrtimer_init(). These timers will expire in
softirq context on PREEMPT_RT.

Setting this allows lockdep to differentiate these timers. If a timer is
marked to expire in hard interrupt context then the timer callback is not
supposed to acquire a regular spinlock instead of a raw_spinlock in the
expiry callback.
