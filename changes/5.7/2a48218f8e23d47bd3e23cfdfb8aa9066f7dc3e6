ALSA: usb-audio: Add mixer workaround for TRX40 and co

Some recent boards (supposedly with a new AMD platform) contain the
USB audio class 2 device that is often tied with HD-audio.  The device
exposes an Input Gain Pad control (id=19, control=12) but this node
doesn't behave correctly, returning an error for each inquiry of
GET_MIN and GET_MAX that should have been mandatory.

As a workaround, simply ignore this node by adding a usbmix_name_map
table entry.  The currently known devices are:
* 0414:a002 - Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Pro WiFi
* 0b05:1916 - ASUS ROG Zenith II
* 0b05:1917 - ASUS ROG Strix
* 0db0:0d64 - MSI TRX40 Creator
* 0db0:543d - MSI TRX40
