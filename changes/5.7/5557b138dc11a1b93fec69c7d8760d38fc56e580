habanalabs: support temperature offset via sysfs

This commit adds support for offsetting the temperatures reading
by a specified value as defined in
https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/hwmon/sysfs-interface
using the standard sysfs defined for hwmon.
This is required by system administrators to inject errors to test
their monitoring applications in data centers.
