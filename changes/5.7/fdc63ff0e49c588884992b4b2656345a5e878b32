ftrace/x86: Fix trace event registration for syscalls without arguments

The refactoring of SYSCALL_DEFINE0() macros removed the ABI stubs and
simply defines __abi_sys_$NAME as alias of __do_sys_$NAME.

As a result kallsyms_lookup() returns "__do_sys_$NAME" which does not match
with the declared trace event name.

See also commit 1c758a2202a6 ("tracing/x86: Update syscall trace events to
handle new prefixed syscall func names").

Add __do_sys_ to the valid prefixes which are checked in
arch_syscall_match_sym_name().
