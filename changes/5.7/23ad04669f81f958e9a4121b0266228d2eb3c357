samples: bpf: Fix build error

GCC 10 is very strict about symbol clash, and lwt_len_hist_user contains
a symbol which clashes with libbpf:

/usr/bin/ld: samples/bpf/lwt_len_hist_user.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `bpf_log_buf'; samples/bpf/bpf_load.o:(.bss+0x8c0): first defined here
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status

bpf_log_buf here seems to be a leftover, so removing it.
