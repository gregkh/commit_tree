bpf: Allow selecting reuseport socket from a SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH

SOCKMAP & SOCKHASH now support storing references to listening
sockets. Nothing keeps us from using these map types a collection of
sockets to select from in BPF reuseport programs. Whitelist the map types
with the bpf_sk_select_reuseport helper.

The restriction that the socket has to be a member of a reuseport group
still applies. Sockets in SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH that don't have sk_reuseport_cb
set are not a valid target and we signal it with -EINVAL.

The main benefit from this change is that, in contrast to
REUSEPORT_SOCKARRAY, SOCK{MAP,HASH} don't impose a restriction that a
listening socket can be just one BPF map at the same time.
