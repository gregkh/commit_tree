powerpc/32: Warn and return ENOSYS on syscalls from kernel

Since commit b86fb88855ea ("powerpc/32: implement fast entry for
syscalls on non BOOKE") and commit 1a4b739bbb4f ("powerpc/32:
implement fast entry for syscalls on BOOKE"), syscalls from
kernel are unexpected and can have catastrophic consequences
as it will destroy the kernel stack.

Test MSR_PR on syscall entry. In case syscall is from kernel,
emit a warning and return ENOSYS error.
