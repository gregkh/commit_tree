hsr: use upper/lower device infrastructure

netdev_upper_dev_link() is useful to manage lower/upper interfaces.
And this function internally validates looping, maximum depth.
All or most virtual interfaces that could have a real interface
(e.g. macsec, macvlan, ipvlan etc.) use lower/upper infrastructure.
