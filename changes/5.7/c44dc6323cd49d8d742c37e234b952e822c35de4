powerpc/64s/kuap: Restore AMR in fast_interrupt_return

Interrupts that use fast_interrupt_return actually do lock AMR, but
they have been ones which tend to come from userspace (or kernel bugs)
in radix mode. With kuap on hash, segment interrupts are taken in
kernel often, which quickly breaks due to the missing restore.
