ARM: dts: sunxi: Fix dtc 'dma-ranges' warnings

'#address-cells' and '#size-cells' are needed in the same node (for the
child bus) as 'dma-ranges' in order to parse it. The kernel is more lax
and will walk up the tree to get the properties from a parent node, but
it's better to be explicit. dtc now does checks on 'dma-ranges' and is
more strict:

arch/arm/boot/dts/sun5i.dtsi:189.4-52: Warning (dma_ranges_format): \
