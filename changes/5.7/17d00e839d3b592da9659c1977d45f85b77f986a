net/mlx5: Add command entry handling completion

When FW response to commands is very slow and all command entries in
use are waiting for completion we can have a race where commands can get
timeout before they get out of the queue and handled. Timeout
completion on uninitialized command will cause releasing command's
buffers before accessing it for initialization and then we will get NULL
pointer exception while trying access it. It may also cause releasing
buffers of another command since we may have timeout completion before
even allocating entry index for this command.
Add entry handling completion to avoid this race.
