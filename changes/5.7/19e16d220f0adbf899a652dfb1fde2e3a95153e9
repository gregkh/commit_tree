neigh: support smaller retrans_time settting

Currently, we limited the retrans_time to be greater than HZ/2. i.e.
setting retrans_time less than 500ms will not work. This makes the user
unable to achieve a more accurate control for bonding arp fast failover.

Update the sanity check to HZ/100, which is 10ms, to let users have more
ability on the retrans_time control.

v3: sync the behavior with IPv6 and update all the timer handler
v2: use HZ instead of hard code number
