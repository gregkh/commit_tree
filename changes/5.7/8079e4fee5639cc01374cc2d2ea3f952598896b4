Revert "mac80211: support NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_CONTROL_PORT_OVER_NL80211_MAC_ADDRS"

This reverts commit 9b125c27998719288e4dcf2faf54511039526692.

As Jouni points out, there's really no need for this, since the
RSN pre-authentication frames are normal data frames, not port
control frames (locally).
