serial: 8250: Fix rs485 delay after console write

Due to a silly copy-paste mistake, commit 7f9803072ff6 ("serial: 8250:
Support console on software emulated rs485 ports") erroneously pauses
for the duration of delay_rts_before_send after writing to the console,
instead of delay_rts_after_send.  Mea culpa.
