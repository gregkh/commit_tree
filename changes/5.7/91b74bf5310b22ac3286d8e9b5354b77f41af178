IB/mlx5: Optimize u64 division on 32-bit arches

Commit f164be8c0366 ("IB/mlx5: Extend caps stage to handle VAR
capabilities") introduced a straight "/" division of the u64 variable
"bar_size".

This was fixed with commit 685eff513183 ("IB/mlx5: Use div64_u64 for
num_var_hw_entries calculation"). However, div64_u64() is redundant here
as mlx5_var_table::stride_size is of type u32.  Make the actual code way
more optimized on 32-bit kernels using div_u64() and fix 80 chars
break-through by the way.
