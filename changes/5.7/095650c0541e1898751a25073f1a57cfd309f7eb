iwlwifi: add support for version 2 of SOC_CONFIGURATION_CMD

This new command is mostly backwards compatible, with the exception
that the device_type element was changed into a bitmask.  The device
type bit remains the same (because we only had 0 and 1 anyway), but
when using v1 we can't set any other bits, because that would change
the integer.

Other than that, the struct remains the same and the driver can set
the device_type bit in both cases, but it can only set the low_latency
bit if VER_2 is used.
