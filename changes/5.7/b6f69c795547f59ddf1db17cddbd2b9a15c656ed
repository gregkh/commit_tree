Revert "ALSA: uapi: Drop asound.h inclusion from asoc.h"

This reverts commit 645c08f17f477915f6d900b767e789852f150054
which was reported to break the build a program using this header.

The original issue was addressed in the alsa-lib side recently, so we
can make the header more self-contained again.
