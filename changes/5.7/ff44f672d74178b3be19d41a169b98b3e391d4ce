thermal/drivers/cpufreq_cooling: Fix return of cpufreq_set_cur_state

When setting the cooling device current state from userspace via sysfs,
the operation fails by returning an -EINVAL.

It appears the recent changes with the per-policy frequency QoS
introduced a regression as reported by:

 https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/3/20/599

The function freq_qos_update_request returns 0 or 1 describing update
effectiveness, and a negative error code on failure. However,
cpufreq_set_cur_state returns 0 on success or an error code otherwise.

Consider the QoS update as successful if the function does not return
an error.
