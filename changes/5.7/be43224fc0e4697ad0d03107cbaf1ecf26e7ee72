netdevsim: Ensure policer drop counter always increases

In case the policer drop counter is retrieved when the jiffies value is
a multiple of 64, the counter will not be incremented.

This randomly breaks a selftest [1] the reads the counter twice and
checks that it was incremented:

```
TEST: Trap policer                                                  [FAIL]
	Policer drop counter was not incremented
```

Fix by always incrementing the counter by 1.
