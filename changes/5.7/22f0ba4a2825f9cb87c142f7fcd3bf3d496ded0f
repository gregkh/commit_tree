scsi: dpt_i2o: rename adpt_i2o_to_scsi() to adpt_i2o_scsi_complete()

Rename the badly named function into adpt_i2o_scsi_complete(), and make it
a void function as the return value is never used.  This also fixes a
potential use-after-free as the return value might be evaluated from the
command result after the command has been freed.
