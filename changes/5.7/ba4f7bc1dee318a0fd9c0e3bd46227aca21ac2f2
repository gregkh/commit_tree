sched/deadline: Make two functions static

Since commit 06a76fe08d4 ("sched/deadline: Move DL related code
from sched/core.c to sched/deadline.c"), DL related code moved to
deadline.c.

Make the following two functions static since they're only used in
deadline.c:

	dl_change_utilization()
	init_dl_rq_bw_ratio()
