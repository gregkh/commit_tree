habanalabs: split the host MMU properties

Host memory may be allocated with huge pages.
A different virtual range may be used for mapping in this case.
Add Huge PCI MMU (HPMMU) properties to support it.
This patch is a prerequisite for future ASICs support and has no effect on
Goya ASIC as currently a single virtual host range is used for all page
sizes.
