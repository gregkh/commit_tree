iio: adc: ad7192: fix null pointer de-reference crash during probe

When the 'spi_device_id' table was removed, it omitted to cleanup/fix the
assignment:
   'indio_dev->name = spi_get_device_id(spi)->name;'

After that patch 'spi_get_device_id(spi)' returns NULL, so this crashes
during probe with null de-ref.

This change fixes this by introducing an ad7192_chip_info struct, and
defines all part-names [that should be assigned to indio_dev->name] in a
'ad7192_chip_info_tbl' table.

With this change, the old 'st->devid' is also moved to be a
'chip_info->chip_id'. And the old 'ID_AD719X' macros have been renamed to
'CHIPID_AD719X'. Tld identifiers have been re-purposed to be enum/index
values in the new 'ad7192_chip_info_tbl'.

This should fix the bug, and maintain the ABI for the 'indio_dev->name'
field.
