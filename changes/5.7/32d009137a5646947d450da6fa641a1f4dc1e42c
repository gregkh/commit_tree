x86/boot: Reload GDTR after copying to the end of the buffer

The GDT may get overwritten during the copy or during extract_kernel,
which will cause problems if any segment register is touched before the
GDTR is reloaded by the decompressed kernel. For safety update the GDTR
to point to the GDT within the copied kernel.
