block: simplify queue allocation

Current make_request based drivers use either blk_alloc_queue_node or
blk_alloc_queue to allocate a queue, and then set up the make_request_fn
function pointer and a few parameters using the blk_queue_make_request
helper.  Simplify this by passing the make_request pointer to
blk_alloc_queue, and while at it merge the _node variant into the main
helper by always passing a node_id, and remove the superfluous gfp_mask
parameter.  A lower-level __blk_alloc_queue is kept for the blk-mq case.
