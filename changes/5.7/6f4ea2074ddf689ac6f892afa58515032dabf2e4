ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for Focusrite Scarlett 2i2

Force it to use asynchronous playback.

Same quirk has already been added for Focusrite Scarlett Solo (2nd gen)
with a commit 46f5710f0b88 ("ALSA: usb-audio: Add quirk for Focusrite
Scarlett Solo").

This also seems to prevent regular clicks when playing at 44100Hz
on Scarlett 2i2 (2nd gen). I did not notice any side effects.

Moved both quirks to snd_usb_audioformat_attributes_quirk() as suggested.
