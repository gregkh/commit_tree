powerpc/32: don't restore r0, r6-r8 on exception entry path after trace_hardirqs_off()

Since commit b86fb88855ea ("powerpc/32: implement fast entry for
syscalls on non BOOKE") and commit 1a4b739bbb4f ("powerpc/32:
implement fast entry for syscalls on BOOKE"), syscalls don't
use the exception entry path anymore. It is therefore pointless
to restore r0 and r6-r8 after calling trace_hardirqs_off().

In the meantime, drop the '2:' label which is unused and misleading.
