iio: adc: stm32-dfsdm: fix device used to request dma

DMA channel request should use device struct from platform device struct.
Currently it's using iio device struct. But at this stage when probing,
device struct isn't yet registered (e.g. device_register is done in
iio_device_register). Since commit 71723a96b8b1 ("dmaengine: Create
symlinks between DMA channels and slaves"), a warning message is printed
as the links in sysfs can't be created, due to device isn't yet registered:
- Cannot create DMA slave symlink
- Cannot create DMA dma:rx symlink

Fix this by using device struct from platform device to request dma chan.
