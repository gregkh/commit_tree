bitops: always inline sign extension helpers

With CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE, objtool reports:

  drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gem/i915_gem_execbuffer.o: warning: objtool: i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl()+0x5b7: call to gen8_canonical_addr() with UACCESS enabled

This means i915_gem_execbuffer2_ioctl() is calling gen8_canonical_addr()
from the user_access_begin/end critical region (i.e, with SMAP disabled).

While it's probably harmless in this case, in general we like to avoid
extra function calls in SMAP-disabled regions because it can open up
inadvertent security holes.

Fix the warning by changing the sign extension helpers to __always_inline.
This convinces GCC to inline gen8_canonical_addr().

The sign extension functions are trivial anyway, so it makes sense to
always inline them.  With my test optimize-for-size-based config, this
actually shrinks the text size of i915_gem_execbuffer.o by 45 bytes -- and
no change for vmlinux.
