x86/Kconfig: Make CMDLINE_OVERRIDE depend on non-empty CMDLINE

When trying to boot an allmodconfig kernel that is built with
KCONFIG_ALLCONFIG=$(pwd)/arch/x86/configs/x86_64_defconfig, it doesn't
boot since CONFIG_CMDLINE_OVERRIDE gets enabled and that requires the
user to pass the full cmdline to CONFIG_CMDLINE.

Change so that CONFIG_CMDLINE_OVERRIDE gets set only if CONFIG_CMDLINE
is set to something except an empty string.
