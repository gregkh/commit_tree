Revert "block: end bio with BLK_STS_AGAIN in case of non-mq devs and REQ_NOWAIT"

This reverts commit c58c1f83436b501d45d4050fd1296d71a9760bcb.

io_uring does do the right thing for this case, and we're still returning
-EAGAIN to userspace for the cases we don't support. Revert this change
to avoid doing endless spins of resubmits.
