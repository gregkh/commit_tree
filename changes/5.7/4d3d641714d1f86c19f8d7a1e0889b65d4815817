clk: tegra: Fix initial rate for pll_a on Tegra124

pll_a_out0 and the I2S clocks are already configured to default to rates
corresponding to a 44.1 kHz sampling rate, but the pll_a configuration
was set to a default that is not listed in the frequency table, which
caused the PLL code to compute an invalid configuration. As a result of
this invalid configuration, Jetson TK1 fails to resume from suspend.

This used to get papered over because the ASoC driver would force audio
clocks to a 44.1 kHz configuration on boot. However, that's not really
necessary and was hence removed in commit ff5d18cb04f4 ("ASoC: tegra:
Enable audio mclk during tegra_asoc_utils_init()").

Fix the initial rate for pll_a so that it matches the 44.1 kHz entry in
the pll_a frequency table.
