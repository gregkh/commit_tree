iio: st_sensors: rely on odr mask to know if odr can be set

Indeed, relying on addr being not 0 cannot work because some device have
their register to set odr at address 0. As a matter of fact, if the odr
can be set, then there is a mask.

Sensors with ODR register at address 0 are: lsm303dlh, lsm303dlhc, lsm303dlm
