ASoC: wm8960: Fix wrong clock after suspend & resume

After suspend & resume, wm8960_hw_params may be called when
bias_level is not SND_SOC_BIAS_ON, then wm8960_configure_clocking
is not called. But if sample rate is changed at that time, then
the output clock rate will be not correct.

So judgement of bias_level is SND_SOC_BIAS_ON in wm8960_hw_params
is not necessary and it causes above issue.
