ALSA: pcm: Use a macro for parameter masks to reduce the needed cast

The parameter bit mask needs often explicit cast with __force,
e.g. for the PCM subformat type.  Instead of adding __force at each
place, which is error prone, this patch introduces a new macro and
replaces the all bit shift with it.  This fixes the sparse warnings
like the following:
  sound/core/pcm_native.c:2508:30: warning: restricted snd_pcm_access_t degrades to integer

No functional changes, just sparse warning fixes.
