btrfs: parameterize dev_extent_min for chunk allocation

Currently, we ignore a device whose available space is less than
"BTRFS_STRIPE_LEN * dev_stripes". This is a lower limit for current
allocation policy (to maximize the number of stripes). This commit
parameterizes dev_extent_min, so that other policies can set their own
lower limitat to ignore a device with insufficient space.
