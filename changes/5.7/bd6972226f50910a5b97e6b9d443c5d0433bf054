mptcp: use untruncated hash in ADD_ADDR HMAC

There is some ambiguity in the RFC as to whether the ADD_ADDR HMAC is
the rightmost 64 bits of the entire hash or of the leftmost 160 bits
of the hash.  The intention, as clarified with the author of the RFC,
is the entire hash.

This change returns the entire hash from
mptcp_crypto_hmac_sha (instead of only the first 160 bits), and moves
any truncation/selection operation on the hash to the caller.
