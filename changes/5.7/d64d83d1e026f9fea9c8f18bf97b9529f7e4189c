KVM: x86: Handle PKU CPUID adjustment in VMX code

Move the setting of the PKU CPUID bit into VMX to eliminate an instance
of the undesirable "unsigned f_* = *_supported ? F(*) : 0" pattern in
the common CPUID handling code.  Drop ->pku_supported(), CPUID
adjustment was the only user.

Note, some AMD CPUs now support PKU, but SVM doesn't yet support
exposing it to a guest.

No functional change intended.
