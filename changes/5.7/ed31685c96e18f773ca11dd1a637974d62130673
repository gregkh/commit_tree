console: Introduce ->exit() callback

Some consoles might require special operations on unregistering.
For instance, serial console, when registered in the kernel,
keeps power on for entire time, until it gets unregistered.
Example of use:

	->setup(console):
		pm_runtime_get(...);

	->exit(console):
		pm_runtime_put(...);

For such cases to have a balance we would provide ->exit() callback.
