x86/boot: Mark global variables as static

Mike Lothian reports that after commit
  964124a97b97 ("efi/x86: Remove extra headroom for setup block")
gcc 10.1.0 fails with

  HOSTCC  arch/x86/boot/tools/build
  /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.1.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld:
  error: linker defined: multiple definition of '_end'
  /usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/10.1.0/../../../../x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld:
  /tmp/ccEkW0jM.o: previous definition here
  collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status
  make[1]: *** [scripts/Makefile.host:103: arch/x86/boot/tools/build] Error 1
  make: *** [arch/x86/Makefile:303: bzImage] Error 2

The issue is with the _end variable that was added, to hold the end of
the compressed kernel from zoffsets.h (ZO__end). The name clashes with
the linker-defined _end symbol that indicates the end of the build
program itself.

Even when there is no compile-time error, this causes build to use
memory past the end of its .bss section.

To solve this, mark _end as static, and for symmetry, mark the rest of
the variables that keep track of symbols from the compressed kernel as
static as well.
