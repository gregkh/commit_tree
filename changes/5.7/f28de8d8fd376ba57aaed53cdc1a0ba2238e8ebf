btrfs: clear DEAD_RELOC_TREE before dropping the reloc root

The DEAD_RELOC_TREE flag is in place in order to avoid a use after free
in init_reloc_root, tracking the presence of reloc_root.  However adding
the explicit tree references in previous patches makes the use after
free impossible because at this point we no longer have a reloc_control
set on the fs_info and thus cannot enter the function.

So move this to be coupled with clearing the root->reloc_root so we're
consistent with all other operations of the reloc root.
