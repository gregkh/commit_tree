KVM: Clean up local variable usage in __kvm_set_memory_region()

Clean up __kvm_set_memory_region() to achieve several goals:

  - Remove local variables that serve no real purpose
  - Improve the readability of the code
  - Better show the relationship between the 'old' and 'new' memslot
  - Prepare for dynamically sizing memslots
  - Document subtle gotchas (via comments)

Note, using 'tmp' to hold the initial memslot is not strictly necessary
at this juncture, e.g. 'old' could be directly copied from
id_to_memslot(), but keep the pointer usage as id_to_memslot() will be
able to return a NULL pointer once memslots are dynamically sized.
