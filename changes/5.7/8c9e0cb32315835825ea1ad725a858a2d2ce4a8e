srcu: Fix __call_srcu()/srcu_get_delay() datarace

The srcu_struct structure's ->srcu_gp_seq_needed_exp field is accessed
locklessly, so updates must use WRITE_ONCE().  This commit therefore
adds the needed WRITE_ONCE() invocations.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
due to failure being unlikely.
