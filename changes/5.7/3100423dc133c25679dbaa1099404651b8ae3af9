ARM: imx: provide v7_cpu_resume() only on ARM_CPU_SUSPEND=y

512a928affd5 ("ARM: imx: build v7_cpu_resume() unconditionally")
introduced an unintended linker error for i.MX6 configurations that have
ARM_CPU_SUSPEND=n which can happen if neither CONFIG_PM, CONFIG_CPU_IDLE,
nor ARM_PSCI_FW are selected.

Fix this by having v7_cpu_resume() compiled only when cpu_resume() it
calls is available as well.

The C declaration for the function remains unguarded to avoid future code
inadvertently using a stub and introducing a regression to the bug the
original commit fixed.
