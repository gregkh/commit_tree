floppy: remove dead code for drives scanning on ARM

On ARM, function fd_scandrives pre-dates Git era, is #ifed 0 out, not
used, and cannot even compile since it references an fdc variable that's
not declared anywhere (supposed to be the global one that we're turning
to current_fdc apparently).

There was also an ifdefde out include of mach/floppy.h that does not
exist anymore either. Let's get rid of them since they complicate the
fixing of the driver.
