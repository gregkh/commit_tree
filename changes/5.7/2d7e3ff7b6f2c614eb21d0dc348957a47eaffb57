RDMA/mlx5: Set GRH fields in query QP on RoCE

GRH fields such as sgid_index, hop limit, et. are set in the QP context
when QP is created/modified.

Currently, when query QP is performed, we fill the GRH fields only if the
GRH bit is set in the QP context, but this bit is not set for RoCE. Adjust
the check so we will set all relevant data for the RoCE too.

Since this data is returned to userspace, the below is an ABI regression.
