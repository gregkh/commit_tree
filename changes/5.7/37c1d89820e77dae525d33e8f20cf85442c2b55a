drm/bridge: ti-sn65dsi86: Use 18-bit DP if we can

The current bridge driver always forced us to use 24 bits per pixel
over the DP link.  This is a waste if you are hooked up to a panel
that only supports 6 bits per color or fewer, since in that case you
can run at 18 bits per pixel and thus end up at a lower DP clock rate.

Let's support this.

While at it, let's clean up the math in the function to avoid rounding
errors (and round in the correct direction when we have to round).
Numbers are sufficiently small (because mode->clock is in kHz) that we
don't need to worry about integer overflow.
