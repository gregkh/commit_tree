ARM: dts: sun8i-a83t: Add thermal trip points/cooling maps

This enables passive cooling by down-regulating CPU voltage
and frequency.

For the trip points, I used values from the BSP code directly.

The critical trip point value is 30°C above the maximum recommended
ambient temperature (70°C) for the SoC from the datasheet, so there's
some headroom even at such a high ambient temperature.
