locktorture: Use private random-number generators

Both lock_torture_writer() and lock_torture_reader() use the "static"
keyword on their DEFINE_TORTURE_RANDOM(rand) declarations, which means
that a single instance of a random-number generator are shared among all
the writers and another is shared among all the readers.  Unfortunately,
this random-number generator was not designed for concurrent access.
This commit therefore removes both "static" keywords so that each reader
and each writer gets its own random-number generator.
