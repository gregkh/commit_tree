samples, bpf: Refactor perf_event user program with libbpf bpf_link

The bpf_program__attach of libbpf(using bpf_link) is much more intuitive
than the previous method using ioctl.

bpf_program__attach_perf_event manages the enable of perf_event and
attach of BPF programs to it, so there's no neeed to do this
directly with ioctl.

In addition, bpf_link provides consistency in the use of API because it
allows disable (detach, destroy) for multiple events to be treated as
one bpf_link__destroy. Also, bpf_link__destroy manages the close() of
perf_event fd.

This commit refactors samples that attach the bpf program to perf_event
by using libbbpf instead of ioctl. Also the bpf_load in the samples were
removed and migrated to use libbbpf API.
