xsk: Add overflow check for u64 division, stored into u32

The npgs member of struct xdp_umem is an u32 entity, and stores the
number of pages the UMEM consumes. The calculation of npgs

  npgs = size / PAGE_SIZE

can overflow.

To avoid overflow scenarios, the division is now first stored in a
u64, and the result is verified to fit into 32b.

An alternative would be storing the npgs as a u64, however, this
wastes memory and is an unrealisticly large packet area.
