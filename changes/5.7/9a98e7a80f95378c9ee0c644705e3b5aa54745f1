vt: don't use kmalloc() for the unicode screen buffer

Even if the actual screen size is bounded in vc_do_resize(), the unicode
buffer is still a little more than twice the size of the glyph buffer
and may exceed MAX_ORDER down the kmalloc() path. This can be triggered
from user space.

Since there is no point having a physically contiguous buffer here,
let's avoid the above issue as well as reducing pressure on high order
allocations by using vmalloc() instead.
