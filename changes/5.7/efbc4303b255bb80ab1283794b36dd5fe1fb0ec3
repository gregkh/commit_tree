powerpc/pseries: Handle UE event for memcpy_mcsafe

memcpy_mcsafe has been implemented for power machines which is used
by pmem infrastructure, so that an UE encountered during memcpy from
pmem devices would not result in panic instead a right error code
is returned. The implementation expects machine check handler to ignore
the event and set nip to continue the execution from fixup code.

Appropriate changes are already made to powernv machine check handler,
make similar changes to pseries machine check handler to ignore the
the event and set nip to continue execution at the fixup entry if we
hit UE at an instruction with a fixup entry.

while we are at it, have a common function which searches the exception
table entry and updates nip with fixup address, and any future common
changes can be made in this function that are valid for both architectures.

powernv changes are made by
commit 895e3dceeb97 ("powerpc/mce: Handle UE event for memcpy_mcsafe")
