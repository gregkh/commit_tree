PCI: Add support for root bus sizing

In certain cases we should be able to enumerate IO and MEM ranges of all
PCI devices installed in the system, and then set respective host bridge
apertures basing on calculated size and alignment.  Particularly when
firmware is broken and fails to assign bridge windows properly, like on
Alpha UP1500 platform.

Actually, almost everything is already in place, and required changes are
minimal:

- add "size_windows" flag to struct pci_host_bridge: when set, it
  instructs __pci_bus_size_bridges() to continue with the root bus;
- in the __pci_bus_size_bridges() path: add checks for bus->self,
  as it can legitimately be null for the root bus.
