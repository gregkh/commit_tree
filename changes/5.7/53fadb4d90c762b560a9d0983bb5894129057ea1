spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Simplify bytes_per_word gymnastics

Reduce the if-then-else-if-then-else sequence to:
 - a simple division in the case of bytes_per_word calculation
 - a memcpy command with a variable size. The semantics of larger-than-8
   xfer->bits_per_word is that those words are to be interpreted and
   transmitted in CPU native endianness.
