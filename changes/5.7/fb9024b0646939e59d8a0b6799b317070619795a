scsi: qla2xxx: Do not log message when reading port speed via sysfs

Calling ql_log() inside qla2x00_port_speed_show() is causing messages to be
output to the console for no particularly good reason.  The sysfs read
routine should just return the information to userspace.  The only reason
to log a message is when the port speed actually changes, and this already
occurs elsewhere.
