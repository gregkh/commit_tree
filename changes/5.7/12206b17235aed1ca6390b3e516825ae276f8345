net/mlx5: Add support for resource dump

On driver load:
- Initialize resource dump data structure and memory access tools (mkey
  & pd).
- Read the resource dump's menu which contains the FW segment
  identifier. Each record is identified by the segment name (ASCII).

During the driver's course of life, users (like reporters) may request
dumps per segment. The user should create a command providing the
segment identifier (SW enumeration) and command keys. In return, the
user receives a command context. In order to receive the dump, the user
should supply the command context and a memory (aligned to a PAGE) on
which the dump content will be written. Since the dump may be larger
than the given memory, the user may resubmit the command until received
an indication of end-of-dump. It is the user's responsibility to destroy
the command.
