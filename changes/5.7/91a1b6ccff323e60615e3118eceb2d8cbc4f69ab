arm64: rename ptrauth key structures to be user-specific

We currently enable ptrauth for userspace, but do not use it within the
kernel. We're going to enable it for the kernel, and will need to manage
a separate set of ptrauth keys for the kernel.

We currently keep all 5 keys in struct ptrauth_keys. However, as the
kernel will only need to use 1 key, it is a bit wasteful to allocate a
whole ptrauth_keys struct for every thread.

Therefore, a subsequent patch will define a separate struct, with only 1
key, for the kernel. In preparation for that, rename the existing struct
(and associated macros and functions) to reflect that they are specific
to userspace.
