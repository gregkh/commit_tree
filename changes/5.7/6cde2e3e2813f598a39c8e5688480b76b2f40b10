scsi: lpfc: Remove handler for obsolete ELS - Read Port Status (RPS)

There was report of an odd "Fix me..." log message, which was tracked down
to the lpfc_els_rcv_rps() routine. This was in handling of a very old and
obsolete ELS - Read Port Status. The RPS ELS was defined in FC-LS-1, but
deprecated in FC-LS-2, and removed from all later FC-LS revisions. It was
replaced by the Read Diagnostic Parameters (RDP) ELS and the Link Error
Status Block descriptor.

There should be no support for the RSP ELS.  Remove support from driver.
