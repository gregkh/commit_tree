drm/i915: s/need_cd2x_updare/can_cd2x_update/

intel_cdclk_needs_cd2x_update() is named rather confusingly.
We don't have to do a cd2x update, rather we are allowed to
do one (as opposed to a full PLL reprogramming with its heavy
handed modeset). So let's rename the function to
intel_cdclk_can_cd2x_update().
