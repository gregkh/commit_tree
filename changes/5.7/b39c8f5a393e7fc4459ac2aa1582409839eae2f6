btrfs: fix ref-verify to catch operations on 0 ref extents

While debugging I noticed I wasn't getting ref verify errors before
everything blew up.  Turns out it's because we don't warn when we try to
add a normal ref via btrfs_inc_ref() if the block entry exists but has 0
references.  This is incorrect, we should never be doing anything other
than adding a new extent once a block entry drops to 0 references.
