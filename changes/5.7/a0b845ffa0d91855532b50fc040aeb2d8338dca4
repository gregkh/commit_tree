apparmor: fix potential label refcnt leak in aa_change_profile

aa_change_profile() invokes aa_get_current_label(), which returns
a reference of the current task's label.

According to the comment of aa_get_current_label(), the returned
reference must be put with aa_put_label().
However, when the original object pointed by "label" becomes
unreachable because aa_change_profile() returns or a new object
is assigned to "label", reference count increased by
aa_get_current_label() is not decreased, causing a refcnt leak.

Fix this by calling aa_put_label() before aa_change_profile() return
and dropping unnecessary aa_get_current_label().
