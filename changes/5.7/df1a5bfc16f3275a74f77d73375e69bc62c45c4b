drm/i915/psr: Force PSR probe only after full initialization

Commit 60c6a14b489b ("drm/i915/display: Force the state compute phase
once to enable PSR") was forcing the state compute too earlier
causing errors because not everything was initialized, so here
moving to the end of i915_driver_modeset_probe() when the display is
all initialized.

Also fixing the place where it disarm the force probe as during the
atomic check phase errors could happen like the ones due locking and
it would cause PSR to never be enabled if that happens.
Leaving the disarm to the atomic commit phase, intel_psr_enable() or
intel_psr_update() will be called even if the current state do not
allow PSR to be enabled.

v2: Check if intel_dp is null in intel_psr_force_mode_changed_set()
v3: Check intel_dp before get dev_priv
v4:
- renamed intel_psr_force_mode_changed_set() to
intel_psr_set_force_mode_changed()
- removed the set parameter from intel_psr_set_force_mode_changed()
- not calling intel_psr_set_force_mode_changed() from
intel_psr_enable/update(), directly setting it after the same checks
that intel_psr_set_force_mode_changed() does
- moved intel_psr_set_force_mode_changed() arm call to
i915_driver_modeset_probe() as it is a better for a PSR call, all the
functions calls happening between the old and the new function call
will cause issue
