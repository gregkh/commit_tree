MAINTAINERS: remove entry after hp100 driver removal

Commit a10079c66290 ("staging: remove hp100 driver") removed all files
from ./drivers/staging/hp/, but missed to adjust MAINTAINERS.

Since then, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains:

  warning: no file matches F: drivers/staging/hp/hp100.*

So, drop HP100 Driver entry in MAINTAINERS now.
