selftests/bpf: Fix usleep() implementation

nanosleep syscall expects pointer to struct timespec, not nanoseconds
directly. Current implementation fulfills its purpose of invoking nanosleep
syscall, but doesn't really provide sleeping capabilities, which can cause
flakiness for tests relying on usleep() to wait for something.
