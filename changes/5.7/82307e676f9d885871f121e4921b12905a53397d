KVM: PPC: Move memslot memory allocation into prepare_memory_region()

Allocate the rmap array during kvm_arch_prepare_memory_region() to pave
the way for removing kvm_arch_create_memslot() altogether.  Moving PPC's
memory allocation only changes the order of kernel memory allocations
between PPC and common KVM code.

No functional change intended.
