kbuild: remove cc-option switch from -Wframe-larger-than=

This CONFIG option was added by commit 35bb5b1e0e84 ("Add option to
enable -Wframe-larger-than= on gcc 4.4"). At that time, the cc-option
check was needed.

According to Documentation/process/changes.rst, the current minimal
supported version of GCC is 4.6, so you can assume GCC supports it.
Clang supports it as well.

Remove the cc-option switch and redundant comments.
