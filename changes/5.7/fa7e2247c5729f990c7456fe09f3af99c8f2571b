dma-direct: make uncached_kernel_address more general

Rename the symbol to arch_dma_set_uncached, and pass a size to it as
well as allow an error return.  That will allow reusing this hook for
in-place pagetable remapping.

As the in-place remap doesn't always require an explicit cache flush,
also detangle ARCH_HAS_DMA_PREP_COHERENT from ARCH_HAS_DMA_SET_UNCACHED.
