net/mlx5e: Remove warning "devices are not on same switch HW"

On tunnel decap rule insertion, the indirect mechanism will attempt to
offload the rule on all uplink representors which will trigger the
"devices are not on same switch HW, can't offload forwarding" message
for the uplink which isn't on the same switch HW as the VF representor.

The above flow is valid and shouldn't cause warning message,
fix by removing the warning and only report this flow using extack.
