KVM: nSVM: avoid loss of pending IRQ/NMI before entering L2

This patch reproduces for nSVM the change that was made for nVMX in
commit b5861e5cf2fc ("KVM: nVMX: Fix loss of pending IRQ/NMI before
entering L2").  While I do not have a test that breaks without it, I
cannot see why it would not be necessary since all events are unblocked
by VMRUN's setting of GIF back to 1.
