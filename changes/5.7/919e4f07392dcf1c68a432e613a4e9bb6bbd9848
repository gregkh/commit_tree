drm/i915/display: Set TRANS_DDI_MODE_SELECT to default value when clearing DDI select

TGL is suffering of timeouts and fifo underruns when disabling
transcoder in MST mode, this is fixed by set TRANS_DDI_MODE_SELECT to
0(HDMI mode) when clearing DDI select.

Although BSpec disable sequence don't require this step, it is a
harmless change and it is also done by Windows driver.
Anyhow HW team was notified about that but it can take some time to
documentation to be updated.

A case that always lead to those issues is:
- do a modeset enabling pipe A and pipe B in the same MST stream
leaving A as master
- disable pipe A, promote B as master doing a full modeset in A
- enable pipe A, changing the master transcoder back to A(doing a
full modeset in B)
- Pow: underruns and timeouts

The transcoders involved will only work again when complete disabled
and their power wells turned off causing a reset in their registers.

v2: Setting TRANS_DDI_MODE_SELECT to default when clearing DDI select
not anymore when disabling TRANS_DDI, both work but this one looks
more safe. (Ville comment)
