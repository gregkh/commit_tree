btrfs: slightly simplify global block reserve calculations

In btrfs_update_global_block_rsv the lines:

  num_bytes = block_rsv->size - block_rsv->reserved;
  block_rsv->reserved += num_bytes;

imply:

  block_rsv->reserved = block_rsv->size;

Assign block_rsv->size to block_rsv->reserved directly and reorder lines
so they match the other branch.
