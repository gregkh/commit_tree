ACPICA: utilities: fix sprintf()

This contains changes for the following ACPICA commit ID's:

d3c5fb4cf5b2880d789c987eb847fc3de3774abc

On 32-bit, the provided sprintf() is non-functional: with a size of
ACPI_UINT32_MAX, String + Size will wrap, meaning End < Start, and
acpi_ut_bound_string_output() will never output anything as a result.

The symptom we saw of this was acpixtract failing to output anything.
