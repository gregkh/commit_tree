x86/syscalls: Revert "x86/syscalls: Make __X32_SYSCALL_BIT be unsigned long"

Revert

  45e29d119e99 ("x86/syscalls: Make __X32_SYSCALL_BIT be unsigned long")

and add a comment to discourage someone else from making the same
mistake again.

It turns out that some user code fails to compile if __X32_SYSCALL_BIT
is unsigned long. See, for example [1] below.

 [ bp: Massage and do the same thing in the respective tools/ header. ]
