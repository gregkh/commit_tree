tcp: fix stretch ACK bugs in Scalable

Change Scalable to properly handle stretch ACKs in additive
increase mode by passing in the count of ACKed packets to
tcp_cong_avoid_ai().

In addition, because we are now precisely accounting for
stretch ACKs, including delayed ACKs, we can now change
TCP_SCALABLE_AI_CNT to 100.
