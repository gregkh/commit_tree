mm/hmm: remove HMM_FAULT_SNAPSHOT

Now that flags are handled on a fine-grained per-page basis this global
flag is redundant and has a confusing overlap with the pfn_flags_mask and
default_flags.

Normalize the HMM_FAULT_SNAPSHOT behavior into one place. Callers needing
the SNAPSHOT behavior should set a pfn_flags_mask and default_flags that
always results in a cleared HMM_PFN_VALID. Then no pages will be faulted,
and HMM_FAULT_SNAPSHOT is not a special flow that overrides the masking
mechanism.

As this is the last flag, also remove the flags argument. If future flags
are needed they can be part of the struct hmm_range function arguments.
