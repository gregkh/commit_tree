drm/i915: Track hw reported context runtime

GPU saves accumulated context runtime (in CS timestamp units) in PPHWSP
which will be useful for us in cases when we are not able to track context
busyness ourselves (like with GuC). Keep a copy of this in struct
intel_context from where it can be easily read even if the context is not
pinned.

v2:
 (Chris)
 * Do not store pphwsp address in intel_context.
 * Log CS wrap-around.
 * Simplify calculation by relying on integer wraparound.
v3:
 * Include total/avg in traces and error state for debugging
