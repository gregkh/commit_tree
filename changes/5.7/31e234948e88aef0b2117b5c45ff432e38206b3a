staging: wilc1000: use YAML schemas for DT binding documentation

Use YAML schemas for wilc1000 DT binding documentations. Currently, the
files are present in '/drivers/staging/wilc1000/' but these will be
moved to '/Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/wireless/' later once
the driver move out-of-staging.
