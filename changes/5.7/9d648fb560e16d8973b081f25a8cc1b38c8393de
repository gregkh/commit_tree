ethtool: fix incorrect tx-checksumming settings reporting

Currently, ethtool feature mask for checksum command is ORed with
NETIF_F_FCOE_CRC_BIT, which is bit's position number, instead of the
actual feature bit - NETIF_F_FCOE_CRC.

The invalid bitmask here might affect unrelated features when toggling
TX checksumming. For example, TX checksumming is always mistakenly
reported as enabled on the netdevs tested (mlx5, virtio_net).
