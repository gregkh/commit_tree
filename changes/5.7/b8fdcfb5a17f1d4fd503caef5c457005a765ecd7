perf map: Fix off by one in strncpy() size argument

This patch fixes an off-by-one error in strncpy size argument in
tools/perf/util/map.c. The issue is that in:

        strncmp(filename, "/system/lib/", 11)

the passed string literal: "/system/lib/" has 12 bytes (without the NULL
byte) and the passed size argument is 11. As a result, the logic won't
match the ending "/" byte and will pass filepaths that are stored in
other directories e.g. "/system/libmalicious/bin" or just
"/system/libmalicious".

This functionality seems to be present only on Android. I assume the
/system/ directory is only writable by the root user, so I don't think
this bug has much (or any) security impact.
