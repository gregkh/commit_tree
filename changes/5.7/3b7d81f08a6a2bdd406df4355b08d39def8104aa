i2c: qcom-geni: Grow a dev pointer to simplify code

Some lines are long here. Use a struct dev pointer to shorten lines and
simplify code. The clk_get() call can fail because of EPROBE_DEFER
problems too, so just remove the error print message because it isn't
useful. Finally, platform_get_irq() already prints an error so just
remove that error message.
