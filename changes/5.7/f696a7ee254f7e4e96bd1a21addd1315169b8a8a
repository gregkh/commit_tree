iwlwifi: yoyo: add PCI config space region type

Add a new region type that allows us to dump the PCI config space.
This is mostly the same as dumping a memory region, but reading from
the device's config space instead.

In order to make this generic and independent of the trans type, we
make a function called iwl_dump_ini_config_iter() that calls a new op
in the transport to read its config space.
