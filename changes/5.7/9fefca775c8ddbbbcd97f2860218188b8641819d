gpiolib: notify user-space about line status changes after flags are set

Currently we emit the REQUESTED line state event after the line is
requested but before the flags are configured. This is obviously wrong
as we want to pass the updated lineinfo to user-space together with the
event.

Since the flags can be configured in different ways depending on how the
line is being requested - we need to call the notifier chain in different
places separately.
