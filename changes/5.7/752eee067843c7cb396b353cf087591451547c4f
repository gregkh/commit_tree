ice: remove unnecessary fallthrough comments

Fallthrough comments are used to explicitly indicate the code is intended
to flow from one case statement to the next in a switch statement rather
than break out of the switch statement.  They are only needed when a case
has one or more statements to execute before falling through to the next
case, not when there is a list of cases for which the same statement(s)
should be executed.
