selftests: netdevsim: Always initialize 'RET' variable

The variable is used by log_test() to check if the test case completely
successfully or not. In case it is not initialized at the start of a
test case, it is possible for the test case to fail despite not
encountering any errors.

Example:

```
...
TEST: Trap group statistics                                         [ OK ]
TEST: Trap policer                                                  [FAIL]
	Policer drop counter was not incremented
TEST: Trap policer binding                                          [FAIL]
	Policer drop counter was not incremented
```

Failure of trap_policer_test() caused trap_policer_bind_test() to fail
as well.

Fix by adding missing initialization of the variable.
