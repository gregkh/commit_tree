r8152: support additional Microsoft Surface Ethernet Adapter variant

Device id 0927 is the RTL8153B-based component of the 'Surface USB-C to
Ethernet and USB Adapter' and may be used as a component of other devices
in future. Tested and working with the r8152 driver.

Update the cdc_ether blacklist due to the RTL8153 'network jam on suspend'
issue which this device will cause (personally confirmed).
