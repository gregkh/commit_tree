kvm: x86: Use KVM CPU capabilities to determine CR4 reserved bits

Using CPUID data can be useful for the processor compatibility
check, but that's it.  Using it to compute guest-reserved bits
can have both false positives (such as LA57 and UMIP which we
are already handling) and false negatives: in particular, with
this patch we don't allow anymore a KVM guest to set CR4.PKE
when CR4.PKE is clear on the host.
