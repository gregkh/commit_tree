arm64: crypto: Modernize names for AES function macros

Now that the rest of the code has been converted to the modern START/END
macros the AES_ENTRY() and AES_ENDPROC() macros look out of place and
like they need updating. Rename them to AES_FUNC_START() and AES_FUNC_END()
to line up with the modern style assembly macros.
