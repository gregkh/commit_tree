KVM: VMX: Gracefully handle faults on VMXON

Gracefully handle faults on VMXON, e.g. #GP due to VMX being disabled by
BIOS, instead of letting the fault crash the system.  Now that KVM uses
cpufeatures to query support instead of reading MSR_IA32_FEAT_CTL
directly, it's possible for a bug in a different subsystem to cause KVM
to incorrectly attempt VMXON[*].  Crashing the system is especially
annoying if the system is configured such that hardware_enable() will
be triggered during boot.

Oppurtunistically rename @addr to @vmxon_pointer and use a named param
to reference it in the inline assembly.

Print 0xdeadbeef in the ultra-"rare" case that reading MSR_IA32_FEAT_CTL
also faults.
