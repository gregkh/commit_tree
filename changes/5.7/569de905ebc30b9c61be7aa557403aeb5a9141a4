bpf: Dont iterate over possible CPUs with interrupts disabled

pcpu_freelist_populate() is disabling interrupts and then iterates over the
possible CPUs. The reason why this disables interrupts is to silence
lockdep because the invoked ___pcpu_freelist_push() takes spin locks.

Neither the interrupt disabling nor the locking are required in this
function because it's called during initialization and the resulting map is
not yet visible to anything.

Split out the actual push assignement into an inline, call it from the loop
and remove the interrupt disable.
