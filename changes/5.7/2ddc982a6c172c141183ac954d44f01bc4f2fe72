iio: industrialio-core: Fix debugfs read

Currently iio_debugfs_read_reg calls debugfs_reg_access
every time it is ran. Reading the same hardware register
multiple times during the same reading of a debugfs file
can cause unintended effects.

For example for each: cat iio:device0/direct_reg_access
the file_operations.read function will be called at least
twice. First will return the full length of the string in
bytes  and the second will return 0.

This patch makes iio_debugfs_read_reg to call debugfs_reg_access
only when the user's buffer position (*ppos) is 0. (meaning
it is the beginning of a new reading of the debugfs file).
