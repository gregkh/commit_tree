mm,thp: stop leaking unreleased file pages

When collapse_file() calls try_to_release_page(), it has already isolated
the page: so if releasing buffers happens to fail (as it sometimes does),
remember to putback_lru_page(): otherwise that page is left unreclaimable
and unfreeable, and the file extent uncollapsible.
