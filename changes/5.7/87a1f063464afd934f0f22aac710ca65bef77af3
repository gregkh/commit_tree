arm64: trap to EL1 accesses to AMU counters from EL0

The activity monitors extension is an optional extension introduced
by the ARMv8.4 CPU architecture. In order to access the activity
monitors counters safely, if desired, the kernel should detect the
presence of the extension through the feature register, and mediate
the access.

Therefore, disable direct accesses to activity monitors counters
from EL0 (userspace) and trap them to EL1 (kernel).

To be noted that the ARM64_AMU_EXTN kernel config does not have an
effect on this code. Given that the amuserenr_el0 resets to an
UNKNOWN value, setting the trap of EL0 accesses to EL1 is always
attempted for safety and security considerations. Therefore firmware
should still ensure accesses to AMU registers are not trapped in
EL2/EL3 as this code cannot be bypassed if the CPU implements the
Activity Monitors Unit.
