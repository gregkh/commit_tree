serial: 8250: 8250_omap: Extend driver data to pass FIFO trigger info

Although same 8250 compliant UART IP is reused across different SoC,
their integration wrt DMA varies greatly across SoCs. Therefore,
different SoC may need to use different FIFO trigger level for DMA
event and DMA configuration parameters. Provide a way to pass this
information via driver data. This is required to support UART DMA on
AM654/J721e SoCs.
