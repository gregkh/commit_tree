crypto: ccree - swap SHA384 and SHA512 larval hashes at build time

Due to the way the hardware works, every double word in the SHA384 and
SHA512 larval hashes must be swapped.  Currently this is done at run
time, during driver initialization.

However, this swapping can easily be done at build time.  Treating each
double word as two words has the benefit of changing the larval hashes'
types from u64[] to u32[], like for all other hashes, and allows
dropping the casts and size doublings when calling cc_set_sram_desc().
