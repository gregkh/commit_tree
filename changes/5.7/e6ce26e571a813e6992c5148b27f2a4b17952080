gfs2: remove check for quotas on in gfs2_quota_check

This patch removes a check from gfs2_quota_check for whether quotas
are enabled by the superblock. There is a test just prior for the
GIF_QD_LOCKED bit in the inode, and that can only be set by functions
that already check that quotas are enabled in the superblock.
Therefore, the check is redundant.
