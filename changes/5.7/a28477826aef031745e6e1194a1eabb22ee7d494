drm/i915/gt: Lift set-wedged engine dumping out of user paths

The user (e.g. gem_eio) can manipulate the driver into wedging itself,
allowing the user to trigger voluminous logging of inconsequential
details. If we lift the dump to direct calls to intel_gt_set_wedged(),
out of the intel_reset failure handling, we keep the detail logging for
what we expect are true HW or test failures without being tricked.
