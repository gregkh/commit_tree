ASoC: tlv320adcx140: Remove undocumented property

Remove undocumented and unneeded ti,use-internal-reg from the example as
it was an artifact from initial development.  The code does not query
for this property and as the document indicates if areg-supply is
undefined then the internal regulator is used.

Fixes: 302c0b7490cd ("dt-bindings: sound: Add TLV320ADCx140 dt
bindings")
