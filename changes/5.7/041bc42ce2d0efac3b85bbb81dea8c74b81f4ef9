KVM: VMX: Micro-optimize vmexit time when not exposing PMU

PMU is not exposed to guest by most of products from cloud providers since the
bad performance of PMU emulation and security concern. However, it calls
perf_guest_switch_get_msrs() and clear_atomic_switch_msr() unconditionally
even if PMU is not exposed to the guest before each vmentry.

~2% vmexit time reduced can be observed by kvm-unit-tests/vmexit.flat on my
SKX server.
