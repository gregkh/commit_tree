x86/unwind: Prevent false warnings for non-current tasks

There's some daring kernel code out there which dumps the stack of
another task without first making sure the task is inactive.  If the
task happens to be running while the unwinder is reading the stack,
unusual unwinder warnings can result.

There's no race-free way for the unwinder to know whether such a warning
is legitimate, so just disable unwinder warnings for all non-current
tasks.
