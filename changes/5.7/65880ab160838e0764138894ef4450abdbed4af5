ARM: OMAP2+: pm33xx-core: Extend platform_data ops for cpuidle

In order for am335x and am437x to properly enter deeper c-states in
cpuidle they must always call into the sleep33/43xx suspend code and
also sometimes invoke the wkup_m3_ipc driver. These are both controlled
by the pm33xx module so we must provide a method for the platform code
to call back into the module when it is available as the core cpuidle
ops that are invoked by the cpuidle-arm driver must remain as built in.

Extend the init platform op to take an idle function as an argument so
that we can use this to call into the pm33xx module for c-states that
need it. Also add a deinit op so we can unregister this idle function
from the PM core when the pm33xx module gets unloaded.
