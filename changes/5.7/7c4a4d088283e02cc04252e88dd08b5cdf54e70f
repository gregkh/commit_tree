dmaengine: idxd: Merge definition of dsa_batch_desc into dsa_hw_desc

We don't need a special structure just for batch descriptors. The
layout matches the general form for other descriptors.

Merge the desc_list_addr field into the union of other aliases for
the the third quadword in the structure.

Create a union to alias "xfer_size" with "desc_count".
