KVM: x86: Move gpa_val and gpa_available into the emulator context

Move the GPA tracking into the emulator context now that the context is
guaranteed to be initialized via __init_emulate_ctxt() prior to
dereferencing gpa_{available,val}, i.e. now that seeing a stale
gpa_available will also trigger a WARN due to an invalid context.
