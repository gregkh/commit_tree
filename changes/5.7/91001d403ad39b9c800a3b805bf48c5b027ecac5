KVM: x86: Warn on zero-size save state for valid CPUID 0xD.N sub-leaf

WARN if the save state size for a valid XCR0-managed sub-leaf is zero,
which would indicate a KVM or CPU bug.  Add a comment to explain why KVM
WARNs so the reader doesn't have to tease out the relevant bits from
Intel's SDM and KVM's XCR0/XSS code.
