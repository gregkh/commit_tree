KVM: VMX: Explicitly clear RFLAGS.CF and RFLAGS.ZF in VM-Exit RSB path

Clear CF and ZF in the VM-Exit path after doing __FILL_RETURN_BUFFER so
that KVM doesn't interpret clobbered RFLAGS as a VM-Fail.  Filling the
RSB has always clobbered RFLAGS, its current incarnation just happens
clear CF and ZF in the processs.  Relying on the macro to clear CF and
ZF is extremely fragile, e.g. commit 089dd8e53126e ("x86/speculation:
Change FILL_RETURN_BUFFER to work with objtool") tweaks the loop such
that the ZF flag is always set.
