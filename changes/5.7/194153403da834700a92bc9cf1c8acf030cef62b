dt-bindings: arm: fix Rockchip Kylin board bindings

A test with the command below gives this error:

arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3036-kylin.dt.yaml: /: compatible:
['rockchip,rk3036-kylin', 'rockchip,rk3036']
is not valid under any of the given schemas

Normally the dt-binding is the authoritative part, so boards should follow
the binding, but in the kylin-case the compatible from the .dts is used for
years in the field now, so fix the binding, as otherwise
we would break old users.

Fix this error by changing 'rockchip,kylin-rk3036' to
'rockchip,rk3036-kylin' in rockchip.yaml.

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
