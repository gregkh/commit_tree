arm64: head: Annotate stext and preserve_boot_args as code

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotation of assembly
functions new macros have been introduced. These replace ENTRY and
ENDPROC with two different annotations for normal functions and those
with unusual calling conventions.  Neither stext nor preserve_boot_args
is called with the usual AAPCS calling conventions and they should
therefore be annotated as code.
