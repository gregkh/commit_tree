powerpc/mm: Don't kmap_atomic() in pte_offset_map() on PPC32

On PPC32, pte_offset_map() does a kmap_atomic() in order to support
page tables allocated in high memory, just like ARM and x86/32.

But since at least 2008 and commit 8054a3428fbe ("powerpc: Remove dead
CONFIG_HIGHPTE"), page tables are never allocated in high memory.

When the page is in low mem, kmap_atomic() just returns the page
address but still disable preemption and pagefault. And it is
not an inlined function, so we suffer function call for no reason.

Make pte_offset_map() the same as pte_offset_kernel() and make
pte_unmap() void, in the same way as PPC64 which doesn't have HIGHMEM.
