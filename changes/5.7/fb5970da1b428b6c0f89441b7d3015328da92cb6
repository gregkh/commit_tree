drm/i915/gt: Use the kernel_context to measure the breadcrumb size

We set up a dummy ring in order to measure the size we require for our
breadcrumb emission, so that we don't have to manually count dwords! We
can pass in the kernel_context to use for this so that if required it is
known for the breadcrumb emitter, and we can reuse some details from the
kernel_context to reduce the number of temporaries we have to mock.
