bpf: Prevent mmap()'ing read-only maps as writable

As discussed in [0], it's dangerous to allow mapping BPF map, that's meant to
be frozen and is read-only on BPF program side, because that allows user-space
to actually store a writable view to the page even after it is frozen. This is
exacerbated by BPF verifier making a strong assumption that contents of such
frozen map will remain unchanged. To prevent this, disallow mapping
BPF_F_RDONLY_PROG mmap()'able BPF maps as writable, ever.
