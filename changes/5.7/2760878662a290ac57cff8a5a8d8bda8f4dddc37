clk: Bail out when calculating phase fails during clk registration

Bail out of clk registration if we fail to get the phase for a clk that
has a clk_ops::get_phase() callback. Print a warning too so that driver
authors can easily figure out that some clk is unable to read back phase
information at boot.
