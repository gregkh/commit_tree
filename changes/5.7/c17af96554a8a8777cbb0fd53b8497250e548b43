btrfs: raid56: simplify tracking of Q stripe presence

There are temporary variables tracking the index of P and Q stripes, but
none of them is really used as such, merely for determining if the Q
stripe is present. This leads to compiler warnings with
-Wunused-but-set-variable and has been reported several times.

fs/btrfs/raid56.c: In function ‘finish_rmw’:
fs/btrfs/raid56.c:1199:6: warning: variable ‘p_stripe’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 1199 |  int p_stripe = -1;
      |      ^~~~~~~~
fs/btrfs/raid56.c: In function ‘finish_parity_scrub’:
fs/btrfs/raid56.c:2356:6: warning: variable ‘p_stripe’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 2356 |  int p_stripe = -1;
      |      ^~~~~~~~

Replace the two variables with one that has a clear meaning and also get
rid of the warnings. The logic that verifies that there are only 2
valid cases is unchanged.
