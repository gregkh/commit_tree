tty: serial: qcom_geni_serial: Allocate port->rx_fifo buffer in probe

To fix the RX cancel command failure, rx_fifo buffer needs to be
flushed in stop_rx() by calling handle_rx().In handle_rx() the data
in rx_fifo buffer is read and then dropped, not sent to upper layers.

If set_termios is called before startup, by this time memory is not
allocated to port->rx_fifo buffer, which leads to a NULL pointer
dereference.

To avoid this NULL pointer dereference allocate memory to port->rx_fifo
in probe itself.
