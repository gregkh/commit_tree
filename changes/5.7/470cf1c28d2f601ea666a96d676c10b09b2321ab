clocksource/drivers/timer-cs5535: Request irq with non-NULL dev_id

Recently all usages of setup_irq() was replaced by request_irq().
request_irq() does a few sanity checks that were not done in
setup_irq(), if they fail irq registration will fail. One of the check
is to ensure that non-NULL dev_id is passed in the case of shared irq.

Fix it by passing non-NULL dev_id while registering the shared irq.
