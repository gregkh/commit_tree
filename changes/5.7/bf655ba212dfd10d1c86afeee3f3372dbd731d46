net: mscc: ocelot: fix address ageing time (again)

ocelot_set_ageing_time has 2 callers:
 - felix_set_ageing_time: from drivers/net/dsa/ocelot/felix.c
 - ocelot_port_attr_ageing_set: from drivers/net/ethernet/mscc/ocelot.c

The issue described in the fixed commit below actually happened for the
felix_set_ageing_time code path only, since ocelot_port_attr_ageing_set
was already dividing by 1000. So to make both paths symmetrical (and to
fix addresses getting aged way too fast on Ocelot), stop dividing by
1000 at caller side altogether.

Fixes: c0d7eccbc761 ("net: mscc: ocelot: ANA_AUTOAGE_AGE_PERIOD holds a value in seconds, not ms")
