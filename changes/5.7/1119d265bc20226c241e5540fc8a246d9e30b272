objtool: Fix infinite loop in find_jump_table()

Kristen found a hang in objtool when building with -ffunction-sections.

It was caused by evergreen_pcie_gen2_enable.cold() being laid out
immediately before evergreen_pcie_gen2_enable().  Since their "pfunc" is
always the same, find_jump_table() got into an infinite loop because it
didn't recognize the boundary between the two functions.

Fix that with a new prev_insn_same_sym() helper, which doesn't cross
subfunction boundaries.
