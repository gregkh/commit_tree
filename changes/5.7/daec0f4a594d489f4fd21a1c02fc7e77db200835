fpga: zynq: Remove clk_get error message for probe defer

In probe, the driver checks for devm_clk_get return and print error
message in the failing case. However for -EPROBE_DEFER this message is
confusing so avoid it.

The similar change was done also by commit 28910cee898c
("fpga: xilinx-pr-decoupler: Remove clk_get error message for probe defer")
