usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix use after free issue as part of queue failure

In AIO case, the request is freed up if ep_queue fails.
However, io_data->req still has the reference to this freed
request. In the case of this failure if there is aio_cancel
call on this io_data it will lead to an invalid dequeue
operation and a potential use after free issue.
Fix this by setting the io_data->req to NULL when the request
is freed as part of queue failure.
