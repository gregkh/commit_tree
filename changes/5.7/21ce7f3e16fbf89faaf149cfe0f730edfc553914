net: dsa: ocelot: the MAC table on Felix is twice as large

When running 'bridge fdb dump' on Felix, sometimes learnt and static MAC
addresses would appear, sometimes they wouldn't.

Turns out, the MAC table has 4096 entries on VSC7514 (Ocelot) and 8192
entries on VSC9959 (Felix), so the existing code from the Ocelot common
library only dumped half of Felix's MAC table. They are both organized
as a 4-way set-associative TCAM, so we just need a single variable
indicating the correct number of rows.
