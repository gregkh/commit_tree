sch_sfq: validate silly quantum values

syzbot managed to set up sfq so that q->scaled_quantum was zero,
triggering an infinite loop in sfq_dequeue()

More generally, we must only accept quantum between 1 and 2^18 - 7,
meaning scaled_quantum must be in [1, 0x7FFF] range.

Otherwise, we also could have a loop in sfq_dequeue()
if scaled_quantum happens to be 0x8000, since slot->allot
could indefinitely switch between 0 and 0x8000.
