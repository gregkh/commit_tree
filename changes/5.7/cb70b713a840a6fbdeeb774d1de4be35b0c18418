drm/i915/sdvo: Reduce the size of the on stack buffers

The strings we want to print to the on stack buffers should
be no more than
8 * 3 + strlen("(GET_SCALED_HDTV_RESOLUTION_SUPPORT)") + 1 = 61
bytes. So let's shrink the buffers down to 64 bytes.

Also switch the BUG_ON()s to WARN_ON()s if I made a mistake in
my arithmentic.
