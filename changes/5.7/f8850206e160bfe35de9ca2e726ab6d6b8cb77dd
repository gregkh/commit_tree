gpio: Switch timestamps to ktime_get_ns()

The existing use of ktime_get_real_ns() in the timestamps from
the GPIO events is dubious.

We have had several discussions about this timestamp, and it is
unclear whether userspace has ever taken into account that a
timestamp from ktime_get_real_ns() can actually move backwards
in time relative the previous timetamp, and userspace is more
likely to expect a monotonic counter.

Background:
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-gpio/CAK8P3a1Skvm48sje8FNDPLYqyz9Lf8q0qX1QETWtyZTxuX4k1g@mail.gmail.com/
https://marc.info/?l=linux-gpio&m=151661955709074&w=2

The change is ABI incompatible, but incompatible in a way that
is IMO more likely to fix future bugs rather than break current
userspace. To the best of my knowledge all userspace expects
a monotonic timestamp and users are just lucky that they very
seldom move backwards in time.
