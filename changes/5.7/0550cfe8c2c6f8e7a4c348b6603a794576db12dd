security: Fix hook iteration for secid_to_secctx

secid_to_secctx is not stackable, and since the BPF LSM registers this
hook by default, the call_int_hook logic is not suitable which
"bails-on-fail" and casues issues when other LSMs register this hook and
eventually breaks Audit.

In order to fix this, directly iterate over the security hooks instead
of using call_int_hook as suggested in:
