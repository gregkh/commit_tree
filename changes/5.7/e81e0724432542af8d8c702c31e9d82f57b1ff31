objtool: Support Clang non-section symbols in ORC generation

When compiling the kernel with AS=clang, objtool produces a lot of
warnings:

  warning: objtool: missing symbol for section .text
  warning: objtool: missing symbol for section .init.text
  warning: objtool: missing symbol for section .ref.text

It then fails to generate the ORC table.

The problem is that objtool assumes text section symbols always exist.
But the Clang assembler is aggressive about removing them.

When generating relocations for the ORC table, objtool always tries to
reference instructions by their section symbol offset.  If the section
symbol doesn't exist, it bails.

Do a fallback: when a section symbol isn't available, reference a
function symbol instead.
