linux/bits.h: add compile time sanity check of GENMASK inputs

GENMASK() and GENMASK_ULL() are supposed to be called with the high bit as
the first argument and the low bit as the second argument.  Mixing them
will return a mask with zero bits set.

Recent commits show getting this wrong is not uncommon, see e.g.  commit
aa4c0c9091b0 ("net: stmmac: Fix misuses of GENMASK macro") and commit
9bdd7bb3a844 ("clocksource/drivers/npcm: Fix misuse of GENMASK macro").

To prevent such mistakes from appearing again, add compile time sanity
checking to the arguments of GENMASK() and GENMASK_ULL().  If both
arguments are known at compile time, and the low bit is higher than the
high bit, break the build to detect the mistake immediately.

Since GENMASK() is used in declarations, BUILD_BUG_ON_ZERO() must be used
instead of BUILD_BUG_ON().

__builtin_constant_p does not evaluate is argument, it only checks if it
is a constant or not at compile time, and __builtin_choose_expr does not
evaluate the expression that is not chosen.  Therefore, GENMASK(x++, 0)
does only evaluate x++ once.

Commit 95b980d62d52 ("linux/bits.h: make BIT(), GENMASK(), and friends
available in assembly") made the macros in linux/bits.h available in
assembly.  Since BUILD_BUG_OR_ZERO() is not asm compatible, disable the
checks if the file is included in an asm file.

Due to bugs in GCC versions before 4.9 [0], disable the check if building
with a too old GCC compiler.
