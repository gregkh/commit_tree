hwmon: (da9052) Synchronize access with mfd

When tsi-as-adc is configured it is possible for in7[0123]_input read to
return an incorrect value if a concurrent read to in[456]_input is
performed. This is caused by a concurrent manipulation of the mux
channel without proper locking as hwmon and mfd use different locks for
synchronization.

Switch hwmon to use the same lock as mfd when accessing the TSI channel.
