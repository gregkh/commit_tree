scsi: hpsa: correct race condition in offload enabled

Correct race condition where ioaccel is re-enabled before the raid_map is
updated. For RAID_1, RAID_1ADM, and RAID 5/6 there is a BUG_ON called which
is bad.

 - Change event thread to disable ioaccel only. Send all requests down the
   RAID path instead.

 - Have rescan thread handle offload_enable.

 - Since there is only one rescan allowed at a time, turning
   offload_enabled on/off should not be racy. Each handler queues up a
   rescan if one is already in progress.

  - For timing diagram, offload_enabled is initially off due to a change
    (transformation: splitmirror/remirror), ...

  otbe = offload_to_be_enabled
  oe   = offload_enabled

   T11                                                  * BUG_ON

  T0 - I/O completion with UA 0x3f 0x0e sets rescan flag.
  T1 - rescan worker thread starts a rescan.
  T2 - event comes in
  T3 - event thread starts and issues "Acknowledge" message
  ...
  T6 - rescan thread has bypassed code to reload new raid map.
  ...
  T7 - event thread runs and sets offload_to_be_enabled
  ...
  T9 - rescan thread turns on offload_enabled.
  T10- request comes in and goes down ioaccel path.
  T11- BUG_ON.

 - After the patch is applied, ioaccel_enabled can only be re-enabled in
   the re-scan thread.
