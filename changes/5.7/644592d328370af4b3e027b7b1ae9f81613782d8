objtool: Fail the kernel build on fatal errors

When objtool encounters a fatal error, it usually means the binary is
corrupt or otherwise broken in some way.  Up until now, such errors were
just treated as warnings which didn't fail the kernel build.

However, objtool is now stable enough that if a fatal error is
discovered, it most likely means something is seriously wrong and it
should fail the kernel build.

Note that this doesn't apply to "normal" objtool warnings; only fatal
ones.
