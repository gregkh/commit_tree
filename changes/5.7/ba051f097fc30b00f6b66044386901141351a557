arm64/kernel: Fix return value when cpu_online() fails in __cpu_up()

If boot_secondary() was successful, and cpu_online() was an error in
__cpu_up(), -EIO was returned, but 0 is returned by commit d22b115cbfbb7
("arm64/kernel: Simplify __cpu_up() by bailing out early").
Therefore, bringup_wait_for_ap() causes the primary core to wait for a
long time, which may cause boot failure.
This commit sets -EIO to return code under the same conditions.
