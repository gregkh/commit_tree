drm/amd/display: fix inputting clk lvl into dml for RN

[Why]
Previous logic is only good for 15W parts. Other configuration
need a smarter logic to match clk levels with pp table in the fuse.

[How]
Cache all 8 DPM level's clock data, find lvl that match each pstate
in the pp table and build input into DML base on that
