mm: kmem: rename (__)memcg_kmem_(un)charge_memcg() to __memcg_kmem_(un)charge()

Drop the _memcg suffix from (__)memcg_kmem_(un)charge functions.  It's
shorter and more obvious.

These are the most basic functions which are just (un)charging the given
cgroup with the given amount of pages.

Also fix up the corresponding comments.
