bpf: Simplify reg_set_min_max_inv handling

reg_set_min_max_inv() contains exactly the same logic as reg_set_min_max(),
just flipped around. While this makes sense in a cBPF verifier (where ALU
operations are not symmetric), it does not make sense for eBPF.

Replace reg_set_min_max_inv() with a helper that flips the opcode around,
then lets reg_set_min_max() do the complicated work.
