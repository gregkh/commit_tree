KVM: x86/mmu: Ignore guest CR3 on fast root switch for direct MMU

Ignore the guest's CR3 when looking for a cached root for a direct MMU,
the guest's CR3 has no impact on the direct MMU's shadow pages (the
role check ensures compatibility with CR0.WP, etc...).

Zero out root_cr3 when allocating the direct roots to make it clear that
it's ignored.
