ring-buffer: Remove all BUG() calls

There's a lot of checks to make sure the ring buffer is working, and if an
anomaly is detected, it safely shuts itself down. But there's a few cases
that it will call BUG(), which defeats the point of being safe (it crashes
the kernel when an anomaly is found!). There's no reason for them. Switch
them all to either WARN_ON_ONCE() (when no ring buffer descriptor is present),
or to RB_WARN_ON() (when a ring buffer descriptor is present).
