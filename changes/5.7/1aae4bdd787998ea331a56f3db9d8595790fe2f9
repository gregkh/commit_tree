bpf: Switch BPF UAPI #define constants used from BPF program side to enums

Switch BPF UAPI constants, previously defined as #define macro, to anonymous
enum values. This preserves constants values and behavior in expressions, but
has added advantaged of being captured as part of DWARF and, subsequently, BTF
type info. Which, in turn, greatly improves usefulness of generated vmlinux.h
for BPF applications, as it will not require BPF users to copy/paste various
flags and constants, which are frequently used with BPF helpers. Only those
constants that are used/useful from BPF program side are converted.
