IB/qib: Call kobject_put() when kobject_init_and_add() fails

When kobject_init_and_add() returns an error in the function
qib_create_port_files(), the function kobject_put() is not called for the
corresponding kobject, which potentially leads to memory leak.

This patch fixes the issue by calling kobject_put() even if
kobject_init_and_add() fails. In addition, the ppd->diagc_kobj is released
along with other kobjects when the sysfs is unregistered.
