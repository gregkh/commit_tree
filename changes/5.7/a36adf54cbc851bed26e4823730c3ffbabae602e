ath11k: config reorder queue for all tids during peer setup

Currently rx tid setup is happening for TID 0 and TID 16
during peer setup. And if other TID packets received for
the peer it will be redirected to rx error ring and not through
reo ring. And this rx tid configuration cannot be done
in the rx error ring path since it is a atomic context.
So moving the rx tid setup for all tids during the peer setup.
This is required to enable PN offload functionality to route
all packets through reo ring.
