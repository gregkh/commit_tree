drm/i915: Add invert-brightness quirk for Thundersoft TST178 tablet

The Thundersoft TST178 tablet uses a DSI panel with an external PWM
controller (as all DSI panels do). But unlike other DSI panels a duty-cycle
of 100% turns the backlight off and 0% sets it to maximum brightness.

I've checked the VBT and there is a BDB_LVDS_BACKLIGHT section, but
it does not set the active_low_pwm flag. This tablet re-uses the main
PCI vendor and product ids for the subsystem ids, so I see no other option
then to add a DMI based quirk to fix this.

Note that the PWM backlight code in intel_panel.c currently does not honor
the vbt.active_low_pwm flag, but that does not matter in this case.
