soundwire: stream: do not update parameters during DISABLED-PREPARED transition

After a system suspend, the ALSA/ASoC core will invoke the .prepare()
callback and a TRIGGER_START when INFO_RESUME is not supported.

Likewise, when an underflow occurs, the .prepare callback will be invoked.

In both cases, the stream can be in DISABLED mode, and will transition
into the PREPARED mode. We however don't want the bus bandwidth to be
recomputed.
