ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix unexpected init_amp override

The commit 1c76aa5fb48d ("ALSA: hda/realtek - Allow skipping
spec->init_amp detection") changed the way to assign spec->init_amp
field that specifies the way to initialize the amp.  Along with the
change, the commit also replaced a few fixups that set spec->init_amp
in HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PROBE with HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PRE_PROBE.  This was rather
aligning to the other fixups, and not supposed to change the actual
behavior.

However, this change turned out to cause a regression on FSC S7020,
which hit exactly the above.  The reason was that there is still one
place that overrides spec->init_amp after HDA_FIXUP_ACT_PRE_PROBE
call, namely in alc_ssid_check().

This patch fixes the regression by adding the proper spec->init_amp
override check, i.e. verifying whether it's still ALC_INIT_UNDEFINED.
