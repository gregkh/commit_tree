ubi: fastmap: Free unused fastmap anchor peb during detach

When CONFIG_MTD_UBI_FASTMAP is enabled, fm_anchor will be assigned
a free PEB during ubi_wl_init() or ubi_update_fastmap(). However
if fastmap is not used or disabled on the MTD device, ubi_wl_entry
related with the PEB will not be freed during detach.

So Fix it by freeing the unused fastmap anchor during detach.
