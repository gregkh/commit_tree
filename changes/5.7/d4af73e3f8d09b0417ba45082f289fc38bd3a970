mm/hugetlb: remove unnecessary memory fetch in PageHeadHuge()

Commit f1e61557f023 ("mm: pack compound_dtor and compound_order into one
word in struct page") changed compound_dtor from a pointer to an array
index in order to pack it.  To check if page has the hugeltbfs
compound_dtor, we can just compare the index directly without fetching the
function pointer.  Said commit did that with PageHuge() and we can do the
same with PageHeadHuge() to make the code a bit smaller and faster.
