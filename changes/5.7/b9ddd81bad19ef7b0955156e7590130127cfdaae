ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: initial SoundWire machine driver autodetect

For now we have a limited number of machine driver configurations, and
we can detect them based on the link configuration returned after
checking hardware and firmware (BIOS) configurations.

The link configuration is checked with a link_mask as well as a list
of _ADR descriptors for each link.

There is a chance that in extreme cases where the BIOS contains too
much information we would need to detect which Slave devices actually
report as 'attached'. This would be more accurate than static
table-based solutions, but it also introduces timing dependencies
since we don't know when those devices might become attached, so will
only be only be looked at if we see limitations with static methods
and the usual quirks based e.g. on DMI information.
