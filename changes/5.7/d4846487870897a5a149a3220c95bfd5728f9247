ceph: decode interval_sets for delegated inos

Starting in Octopus, the MDS will hand out caps that allow the client
to do asynchronous file creates under certain conditions. As part of
that, the MDS will delegate ranges of inode numbers to the client.

Add the infrastructure to decode these ranges, and stuff them into an
xarray for later consumption by the async creation code.

Because the xarray code currently only handles unsigned long indexes,
and those are 32-bits on 32-bit arches, we only enable the decoding when
running on a 64-bit arch.
