gcc-10: mark more functions __init to avoid section mismatch warnings

It seems that for whatever reason, gcc-10 ends up not inlining a couple
of functions that used to be inlined before.  Even if they only have one
single callsite - it looks like gcc may have decided that the code was
unlikely, and not worth inlining.

The code generation difference is harmless, but caused a few new section
mismatch errors, since the (now no longer inlined) function wasn't in
the __init section, but called other init functions:

   Section mismatch in reference from the function kexec_free_initrd() to the function .init.text:free_initrd_mem()
   Section mismatch in reference from the function tpm2_calc_event_log_size() to the function .init.text:early_memremap()
   Section mismatch in reference from the function tpm2_calc_event_log_size() to the function .init.text:early_memunmap()

So add the appropriate __init annotation to make modpost not complain.
In both cases there were trivially just a single callsite from another
__init function.
