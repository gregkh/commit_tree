irqchip/gic-v4.1: Ensure mutual exclusion between vPE affinity change and RD access

Before GICv4.1, all operations would be serialized with the affinity
changes by virtue of using the same ITS command queue. With v4.1, things
change, as invalidations (and a number of other operations) are issued
using the redistributor MMIO frame.

We must thus make sure that these redistributor accesses cannot race
against aginst the affinity change, or we may end-up talking to the
wrong redistributor.

To ensure this, we expand the irq_to_cpuid() helper to take a spinlock
when the LPI is mapped to a vLPI (a new per-VPE lock) on each operation
that requires mutual exclusion.
