x86/entry/entry_32: Route int3 through common_exception

int3 is not using the common_exception path for purely historical reasons,
but there is no reason to keep it the only exception which is different.

Make it use common_exception so the upcoming changes to autogenerate the
entry stubs do not have to special case int3.
