arm64: Introduce get_cpu_ops() helper function

This introduces get_cpu_ops() to return the CPU operations according to
the given CPU index. For now, it simply returns the @cpu_ops[cpu] as
before. Also, helper function __cpu_try_die() is introduced to be shared
by cpu_die() and ipi_cpu_crash_stop(). So it shouldn't introduce any
functional changes.
