io-wq: handle hashed writes in chains

We always punt async buffered writes to an io-wq helper, as the core
kernel does not have IOCB_NOWAIT support for that. Most buffered async
writes complete very quickly, as it's just a copy operation. This means
that doing multiple locking roundtrips on the shared wqe lock for each
buffered write is wasteful. Additionally, buffered writes are hashed
work items, which means that any buffered write to a given file is
serialized.

Keep identicaly hashed work items contiguously in @wqe->work_list, and
track a tail for each hash bucket. On dequeue of a hashed item, splice
all of the same hash in one go using the tracked tail. Until the batch
is done, the caller doesn't have to synchronize with the wqe or worker
locks again.
