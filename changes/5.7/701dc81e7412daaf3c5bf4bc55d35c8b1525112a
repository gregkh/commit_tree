s390/mm: remove fake numa support

It turned out that fake numa support is rather useless on s390, since
there are no scenarios where there is any performance or other benefit
when used.

However it does provide maintenance cost and breaks from time to time.
Therefore remove it.

CONFIG_NUMA is still supported with a very small backend and only one
node. This way userspace applications which require NUMA interfaces
continue to work.

Note that NODES_SHIFT is set to 1 (= 2 nodes) instead of 0 (= 1 node),
since there is quite a bit of kernel code which assumes that more than
one node is possible if CONFIG_NUMA is enabled.
