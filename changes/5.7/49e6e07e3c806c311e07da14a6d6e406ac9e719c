MIPS: pass non-NULL dev_id on shared request_irq()

Recently all usages of setup_irq() was replaced by request_irq().
request_irq() does a few sanity checks that were not done in
setup_irq(), if they fail irq registration will fail. One of the check
is to ensure that non-NULL dev_id is passed in the case of shared irq.
This caused malta on qemu to hang.

Fix it by passing handler as dev_id to all request_irq()'s that are
shared. For sni, instead of passing non-NULL dev_id, remove shared irq
flags.
