spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Don't access reserved fields in SPI_MCR

The SPI_MCR_PCSIS macro assumes that the controller has a number of chip
select signals equal to 6. That is not always the case, but actually is
described through the driver-specific "spi-num-chipselects" device tree
binding. LS1028A for example only has 4 chip selects.

Don't write to the upper bits of the PCSIS field, which are reserved in
the reference manual.
