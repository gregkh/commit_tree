ASoC: SOF: add core id to sof_ipc_comp

Adds core id to sof_ipc_comp. The intention of this change
is to inform FW on which core that particular component
should run. Right now core id is only passed when pipeline
is created, which is not flexible enough and doesn't allow
for FW to handle this the right way.
