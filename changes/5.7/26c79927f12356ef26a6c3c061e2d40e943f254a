ath11k: Configure hash based reo destination ring selection

Current implementation of pdev based reo destination ring
selection is replaced by hash based ring selection so as to
ensure all the available rings are utilized for better performance.

The 4 reo destination rings are selected by the HW based on the
hash value computed from the received packet based on the 5 tuple
{ip src/ip dst/src port/dst port/protocol}. Out of the 32 hash values
used by the hw, the driver assigns 8 values per reo destination ring
to each of the 4 reo destination rings.
