gcc-plugins/stackleak: Avoid assignment for unused macro argument

With GCC version >= 8, the cgraph_create_edge() macro argument using
"frequency" goes unused. Instead of assigning a temporary variable for
the argument, pass the compute_call_stmt_bb_frequency() call directly
as the macro argument so that it will just not be called when it is
not wanted by the macros.

Silences the warning:

scripts/gcc-plugins/stackleak_plugin.c:54:6: warning: variable ‘frequency’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Now builds cleanly with gcc-7 and gcc-9. Both boot and pass
STACKLEAK_ERASING LKDTM test.
