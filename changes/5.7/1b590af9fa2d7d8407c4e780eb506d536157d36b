staging: rtl8723bs: rtw_cmd: Compress lines for immediate return

Compress two lines into a single line if immediate return statement is found.
It also removes variable cmd_obj as it is no longer needed.

It is done using script Coccinelle.
And coccinelle uses following semantic patch for this compression function:

@@
expression ret;
identifier f;
@@

-ret =
+return
     f(...);
-return ret;
