staging: wilc1000: Use crc7 in lib/ rather than a private copy

The code in lib/ is the desired polynomial, and even includes
the 1-bit left shift in the table rather than needing to code
it explicitly.

While I'm in Kconfig, add a description of what a WILC1000 is.
Kconfig questions that require me to look up a data sheet to
find out that I probably don't have one are a pet peeve.
