nvme: Fix ctrl use-after-free during sysfs deletion

In case nvme_sysfs_delete() is called by the user before taking the ctrl
reference count, the ctrl may be freed during the creation and cause the
bug. Take the reference as soon as the controller is externally visible,
which is done by cdev_device_add() in nvme_init_ctrl(). Also take the
reference count at the core layer instead of taking it on each transport
separately.
