net/mlx5e: Don't allow forwarding between uplink

We can install forwarding packets rule between uplink
in switchdev mode, as show below. But the hardware does
not do that as expected (mlnx_perf -i $PF1, we can't get
the counter of the PF1). By the way, if we add the uplink
PF0, PF1 to Open vSwitch and enable hw-offload, the rules
can be offloaded but not work fine too. This patch add a
check and if so return -EOPNOTSUPP.

$ tc filter add dev $PF0 protocol all parent ffff: prio 1 handle 1 \
    flower skip_sw action mirred egress redirect dev $PF1

$ tc -d -s filter show dev $PF0 ingress
