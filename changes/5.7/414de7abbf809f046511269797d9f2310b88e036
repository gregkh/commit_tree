KVM: Drop kvm_arch_create_memslot()

Remove kvm_arch_create_memslot() now that all arch implementations are
effectively nops.  Removing kvm_arch_create_memslot() eliminates the
possibility for arch specific code to allocate memory prior to setting
a memslot, which sets the stage for simplifying kvm_free_memslot().
