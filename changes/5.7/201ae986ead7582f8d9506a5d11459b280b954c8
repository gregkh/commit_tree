KVM: s390: protvirt: Implement interrupt injection

This defines the necessary data structures in the SIE control block to
inject machine checks,external and I/O interrupts. We first define the
the interrupt injection control, which defines the next interrupt to
inject. Then we define the fields that contain the payload for machine
checks,external and I/O interrupts.
This is then used to implement interruption injection for the following
list of interruption types:

   - I/O (uses inject io interruption)
     __deliver_io

   - External (uses inject external interruption)
     __deliver_cpu_timer
     __deliver_ckc
     __deliver_emergency_signal
     __deliver_external_call

   - cpu restart (uses inject restart interruption)
     __deliver_restart

   - machine checks (uses mcic, failing address and external damage)
     __write_machine_check

Please note that posted interrupts (GISA) are not used for protected
guests as of today.

The service interrupt is handled in a followup patch.
