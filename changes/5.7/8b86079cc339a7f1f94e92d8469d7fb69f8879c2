KVM: x86: Simplify handling of Centaur CPUID leafs

Refactor the handling of the Centaur-only CPUID leaf to detect the leaf
via a runtime query instead of adding a one-off callback in the static
array.  When the callback was introduced, there were additional fields
in the array's structs, and more importantly, retpoline wasn't a thing.

No functional change intended.
