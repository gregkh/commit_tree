tpm: Don't make log failures fatal

If a TPM is in disabled state, it's reasonable for it to have an empty
log. Bailing out of probe in this case means that the PPI interface
isn't available, so there's no way to then enable the TPM from the OS.
In general it seems reasonable to ignore log errors - they shouldn't
interfere with any other TPM functionality.
