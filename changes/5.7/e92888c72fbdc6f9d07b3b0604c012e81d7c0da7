bpf: Enforce returning 0 for fentry/fexit progs

Currently, tracing/fentry and tracing/fexit prog
return values are not enforced. In trampoline codes,
the fentry/fexit prog return values are ignored.
Let us enforce it to be 0 to avoid confusion and
allows potential future extension.

This patch also explicitly added return value
checking for tracing/raw_tp, tracing/fmod_ret,
and freplace programs such that these program
return values can be anything. The purpose are
two folds:
 1. to make it explicit about return value expectations
    for these programs in verifier.
 2. for tracing prog_type, if a future attach type
    is added, the default is -ENOTSUPP which will
    enforce to specify return value ranges explicitly.
