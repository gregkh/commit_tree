net: qrtr: send msgs from local of same id as broadcast

If the local node id(qrtr_local_nid) is not modified after its
initialization, it equals to the broadcast node id(QRTR_NODE_BCAST).
So the messages from local node should not be taken as broadcast
and keep the process going to send them out anyway.

The definitions are as follow:
static unsigned int qrtr_local_nid = NUMA_NO_NODE;
