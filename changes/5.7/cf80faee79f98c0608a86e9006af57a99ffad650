devlink: add function to take snapshot while locked

A future change is going to add a new devlink command to request
a snapshot on demand. This function will want to call the
devlink_region_snapshot_create function while already holding the
devlink instance lock.

Extract the logic of this function into a static function prefixed by
`__` to indicate that it is an internal helper function. Modify the
original function to be implemented in terms of the new locked
function.
