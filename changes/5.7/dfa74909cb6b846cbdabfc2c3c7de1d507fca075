xdp: Reset prog in dev_change_xdp_fd when fd is negative

The commit mentioned in the Fixes tag reuses the local prog variable
when looking up an expected_fd. The variable is not reset when fd < 0
causing a detach with the expected_fd set to actually call
dev_xdp_install for the existing program. The end result is that the
detach does not happen.
