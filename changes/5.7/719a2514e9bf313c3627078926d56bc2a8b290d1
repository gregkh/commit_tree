ceph: consider inode's last read/write when calculating wanted caps

Add i_last_rd and i_last_wr to ceph_inode_info. These fields are
used to track the last time the client acquired read/write caps for
the inode.

If there is no read/write on an inode for 'caps_wanted_delay_max'
seconds, __ceph_caps_file_wanted() does not request caps for read/write
even there are open files.

Call __ceph_touch_fmode() for dir operations. __ceph_caps_file_wanted()
calculates dir's wanted caps according to last dir read/modification. If
there is recent dir read, dir inode wants CEPH_CAP_ANY_SHARED caps. If
there is recent dir modification, also wants CEPH_CAP_FILE_EXCL.

Readdir is a special case. Dir inode wants CEPH_CAP_FILE_EXCL after
readdir, as with that, modifications do not need to release
CEPH_CAP_FILE_SHARED or invalidate all dentry leases issued by readdir.
