Input: elants_i2c - support palm detection

Elan uses the least significant bit of byte 33 to signal the type of
contact (finger versus palm). The default value is 1 for all firmwares,
which is reported as MT_TOOL_FINGER. If firmware supports palm detection,
the bit will change to 0 and the driver will report such contact as
MT_TOOL_PALM.
