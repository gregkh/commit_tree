vfio/pci: Add sriov_configure support

With the VF Token interface we can now expect that a vfio userspace
driver must be in collaboration with the PF driver, an unwitting
userspace driver will not be able to get past the GET_DEVICE_FD step
in accessing the device.  We can now move on to actually allowing
SR-IOV to be enabled by vfio-pci on the PF.  Support for this is not
enabled by default in this commit, but it does provide a module option
for this to be enabled (enable_sriov=1).  Enabling VFs is rather
straightforward, except we don't want to risk that a VF might get
autoprobed and bound to other drivers, so a bus notifier is used to
"capture" VFs to vfio-pci using the driver_override support.  We
assume any later action to bind the device to other drivers is
condoned by the system admin and allow it with a log warning.

vfio-pci will disable SR-IOV on a PF before releasing the device,
allowing a VF driver to be assured other drivers cannot take over the
PF and that any other userspace driver must know the shared VF token.
This support also does not provide a mechanism for the PF userspace
driver itself to manipulate SR-IOV through the vfio API.  With this
patch SR-IOV can only be enabled via the host sysfs interface and the
PF driver user cannot create or remove VFs.
