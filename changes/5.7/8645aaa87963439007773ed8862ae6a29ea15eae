powerpc/eeh: Add sysfs files in late probe

Move creating the EEH specific sysfs files into eeh_add_device_late()
rather than being open-coded all over the place. Calling the function is
generally done immediately after calling eeh_add_device_late() anyway. This
is also a correctness fix since currently the sysfs files will be added
even if the EEH probe happens to fail.

Similarly, on pseries we currently add the sysfs files before calling
eeh_add_device_late(). This is flat-out broken since the sysfs files
require the pci_dev->dev.archdata.edev pointer to be set, and that is done
in eeh_add_device_late().
