btrfs: introduce per-inode file extent tree

In order to keep track of where we have file extents on disk, and thus
where it is safe to adjust the i_size to, we need to have a tree in
place to keep track of the contiguous areas we have file extents for.

Add helpers to use this tree, as it's not required for NO_HOLES file
systems.  We will use this by setting DIRTY for areas we know we have
file extent item's set, and clearing it when we remove file extent items
for truncation.
