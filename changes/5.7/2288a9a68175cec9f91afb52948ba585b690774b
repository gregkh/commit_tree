mm/hmm: return -EFAULT when setting HMM_PFN_ERROR on requested valid pages

hmm_range_fault() should never return 0 if the caller requested a valid
page, but the pfns output for that page would be HMM_PFN_ERROR.

hmm_pte_need_fault() must always be called before setting HMM_PFN_ERROR to
detect if the page is in faulting mode or not.

Fix two cases in hmm_vma_walk_pmd() and reorganize some of the duplicated
code.
