sched/rt: Optimize cpupri_find() on non-heterogenous systems

By introducing a new cpupri_find_fitness() function that takes the
fitness_fn as an argument and only called when asym_system static key is
enabled.

cpupri_find() is now a wrapper function that calls cpupri_find_fitness()
passing NULL as a fitness_fn, hence disabling the logic that handles
fitness by default.
