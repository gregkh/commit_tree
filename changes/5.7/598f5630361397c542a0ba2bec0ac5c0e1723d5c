um: Fix overlapping ELF segments when statically linked

When statically linked, the .text section in UML kernels is not page
aligned, causing it to share a page with the executable headers. As
.text and the executable headers have different permissions, this causes
the kernel to wish to map the same page twice (once as headers with r--
permissions, once as .text with r-x permissions), causing a segfault,
and a nasty message printed to the host kernel's dmesg:

"Uhuuh, elf segment at 0000000060000000 requested but the memory is
mapped already"

By aligning the .text to a page boundary (as in the dynamically linked
version in dyn.lds.S), there is no such overlap, and the kernel runs
correctly.
