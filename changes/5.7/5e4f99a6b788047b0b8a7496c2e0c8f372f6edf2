staging: iio: ad2s1210: Fix SPI reading

If the serial interface is used, the 8-bit address should be latched using
the rising edge of the WR/FSYNC signal.

This basically means that a CS change is required between the first byte
sent, and the second one.
This change splits the single-transfer transfer of 2 bytes into 2 transfers
with a single byte, and CS change in-between.

Note fixes tag is not accurate, but reflects a point beyond which there
are too many refactors to make backporting straight forward.
