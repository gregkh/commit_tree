rtc: make definitions in include/uapi/linux/rtc.h actually useful for user space

BIT() macro is not defined in UAPI headers; there is, however, similarly
defined _BITUL() macro present in include/uapi/linux/const.h; use it
instead and include <linux/const.h> and <linux/ioctl.h> in order to make
the definitions provided in the header useful.
