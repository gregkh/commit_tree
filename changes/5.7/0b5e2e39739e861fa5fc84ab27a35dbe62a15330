nexthop: Expand nexthop_is_multipath in a few places

I got too fancy consolidating checks on multipath type. The result
is that path lookups can access 2 different nh_grp structs as exposed
by Nik's torture tests. Expand nexthop_is_multipath within nexthop.h to
avoid multiple, nh_grp dereferences and make decisions based on the
consistent struct.

Only 2 places left using nexthop_is_multipath are within IPv6, both
only check that the nexthop is a multipath for a branching decision
which are acceptable.
