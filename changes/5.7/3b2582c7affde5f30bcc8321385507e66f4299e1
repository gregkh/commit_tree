batman-adv: Avoid RCU list-traversal in spinlock

The new CONFIG_PROVE_RCU_LIST requires a condition statement in
(h)list_for_each_entry_rcu when the code might be executed in a non RCU
non-reader section with the writer lock. Otherwise lockdep might cause a
false positive warning like

  =============================
  WARNING: suspicious RCU usage
  -----------------------------
  translation-table.c:940 RCU-list traversed in non-reader section!!

batman-adv is (mostly) following the examples from the RCU documentation
and is using the normal list-traversal primitives instead of the RCU
list-traversal primitives when the writer (spin)lock is held.

The remaining users of RCU list-traversal primitives with writer spinlock
have to be converted to the same style as the rest of the code.
