Input: goodix - add support for getting IRQ + reset GPIOs on Bay Trail devices

On most Bay Trail (x86, UEFI + ACPI) devices the ACPI tables do not have
a _DSD with a "daffd814-6eba-4d8c-8a91-bc9bbf4aa301" UUID, adding
"irq-gpios" and "reset-gpios" mappings, so we cannot get the GPIOS by name
without first manually adding mappings ourselves.

These devices contain 2 GpioIo resource in their _CRS table, on all 4 such
devices which I have access to, the order of the 2 GPIOs is reset, int.

Note that the GPIO to which the touchscreen controller irq pin is connected
is configured in direct-irq mode on these Bay Trail devices, the
pinctrl-baytrail.c driver still allows controlling the pin as a GPIO in
this case, but this is not necessarily the case on other X86 ACPI
platforms, nor do we have a guarantee that the GPIO order is the same
elsewhere, so we limit the use of a _CRS table with 2 GpioIo resources
to Bay Trail devices only.
