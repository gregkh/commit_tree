drm/amdgpu: disable gpu_sched load balancer for vcn jobs

VCN HW doesn't support dynamic load balance on multiple instances
for a context. This patch initializes VNC entities with only one
drm_gpu_scheduler picked by drm_sched_pick_best(). Picking a
drm_gpu_scheduler using drm_sched_pick_best() ensures that we
do load balance among multiple contexts but not among multiple
jobs in a context.
