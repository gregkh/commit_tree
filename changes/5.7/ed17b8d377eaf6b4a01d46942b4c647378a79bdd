xfrm: fix a warning in xfrm_policy_insert_list

This waring can be triggered simply by:

  # ip xfrm policy update src 192.168.1.1/24 dst 192.168.1.2/24 dir in \
    priority 1 mark 0 mask 0x10  #[1]
  # ip xfrm policy update src 192.168.1.1/24 dst 192.168.1.2/24 dir in \
    priority 2 mark 0 mask 0x1   #[2]
  # ip xfrm policy update src 192.168.1.1/24 dst 192.168.1.2/24 dir in \
    priority 2 mark 0 mask 0x10  #[3]

Then dmesg shows:

  [ ] WARNING: CPU: 1 PID: 7265 at net/xfrm/xfrm_policy.c:1548

The issue was introduced by Commit 7cb8a93968e3 ("xfrm: Allow inserting
policies with matching mark and different priorities"). After that, the
policies [1] and [2] would be able to be added with different priorities.

However, policy [3] will actually match both [1] and [2]. Policy [1]
was matched due to the 1st 'return true' in xfrm_policy_mark_match(),
and policy [2] was matched due to the 2nd 'return true' in there. It
caused WARN_ON() in xfrm_policy_insert_list().

This patch is to fix it by only (the same value and priority) as the
same policy in xfrm_policy_mark_match().

Thanks to Yuehaibing, we could make this fix better.

v1->v2:
  - check policy->mark.v == pol->mark.v only without mask.
