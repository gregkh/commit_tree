ALSA: hda: Add driver blacklist

The recent AMD platform exposes an HD-audio bus but without any actual
codecs, which is internally tied with a USB-audio device, supposedly.
It results in "no codecs" error of HD-audio bus driver, and it's
nothing but a waste of resources.

This patch introduces a static blacklist table for skipping such a
known bogus PCI SSID entry.  As of writing this patch, the known SSIDs
are:
* 1043:874f - ASUS ROG Zenith II / Strix
* 1462:cb59 - MSI TRX40 Creator
* 1462:cb60 - MSI TRX40
