KVM: Reinstall old memslots if arch preparation fails

Reinstall the old memslots if preparing the new memory region fails
after invalidating a to-be-{re}moved memslot.

Remove the superfluous 'old_memslots' variable so that it's somewhat
clear that the error handling path needs to free the unused memslots,
not simply the 'old' memslots.
