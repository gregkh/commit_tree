platform/chrome: cros_usbpd_notify: Fix cros-usbpd-notify notifier

cros-usbpd-notify notifier was returning NOTIFY_BAD when no host event
was available in the MKBP message.
But MKBP messages are used to transmit other information, so return
NOTIFY_DONE instead, to allow other notifier to be called.
