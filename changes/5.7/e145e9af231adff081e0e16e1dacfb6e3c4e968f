ASoC: SOF: Generic probe compress operations

Define system-agnostic probe compress flow which serves as a base for
actual, hardware-dependent implementations.
As per firmware spec, maximum of one extraction stream is allowed, while
for injection, there can be plenty.

Apart from probe_pointer, all probe compress operations are mandatory.
Copy operation is defined as unified as its flow should be shared across
all SOF systems.
