mei: me: fix irq number stored in hw struct

Commit 261b3e1f2a01 ("mei: me: store irq number in the hw struct.")
stores the irq number in the hw struct before MSI is enabled.  This
caused a regression for mei_me_synchronize_irq() waiting for the wrong
irq number.  On my laptop this causes a hang on shutdown.  Fix the issue
by storing the irq number after enabling MSI.
