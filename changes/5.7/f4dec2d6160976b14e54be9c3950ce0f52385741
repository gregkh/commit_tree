Revert "Input: i8042 - add ThinkPad S230u to i8042 nomux list"

This reverts commit 18931506465a762ffd3f4803d36a18d336a67da9. From Kevin
Locke:

"... nomux only appeared to fix the issue because the controller
continued working after warm reboots. After more thorough testing from
both warm and cold start, I now believe the entry should be added to
i8042_dmi_reset_table rather than i8042_dmi_nomux_table as i8042.reset=1
alone is sufficient to avoid the issue from both states while
i8042.nomux is not."
