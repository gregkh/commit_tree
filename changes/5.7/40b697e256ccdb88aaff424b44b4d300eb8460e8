drm/etnaviv: fix perfmon domain interation

The GC860 has one GPU device which has a 2d and 3d core. In this case
we want to expose perfmon information for both cores.

The driver has one array which contains all possible perfmon domains
with some meta data - doms_meta. Here we can see that for the GC860
two elements of that array are relevant:

  doms_3d: is at index 0 in the doms_meta array with 8 perfmon domains
  doms_2d: is at index 1 in the doms_meta array with 1 perfmon domain

The userspace driver wants to get a list of all perfmon domains and
their perfmon signals. This is done by iterating over all domains and
their signals. If the userspace driver wants to access the domain with
id 8 the kernel driver fails and returns invalid data from doms_3d with
and invalid offset.

This results in:
  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address 00000000

On such a device it is not possible to use the userspace driver at all.

The fix for this off-by-one error is quite simple.
