nft_set_pipapo: Prepare for vectorised implementation: alignment

SIMD vector extension sets require stricter alignment than native
instruction sets to operate efficiently (AVX, NEON) or for some
instructions to work at all (AltiVec).

Provide facilities to define arbitrary alignment for lookup tables
and scratch maps. By defining byte alignment with NFT_PIPAPO_ALIGN,
lt_aligned and scratch_aligned pointers become available.

Additional headroom is allocated, and pointers to the possibly
unaligned, originally allocated areas are kept so that they can
be freed.
