tty: serial: owl: add "much needed" clk_prepare_enable()

commit 8ba92cf59335 ("arm64: dts: actions: s700: Add Clock Management Unit")
breaks the UART on Cubieboard7-lite (based on S700 SoC), This is due to the
fact that generic clk routine clk_disable_unused() disables the gate clks,
and that in turns disables OWL UART (but UART driver never enables it). To
prove this theory, Andre suggested to use "clk_ignore_unused" in kernel
commnd line and it worked (Kernel happily lands into RAMFS world :)).

This commit fix this up by adding clk_prepare_enable().
