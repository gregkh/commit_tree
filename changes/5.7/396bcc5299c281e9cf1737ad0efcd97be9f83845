mm: remove CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGE_PAGECACHE

Commit e496cf3d7821 ("thp: introduce CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGE_PAGECACHE")
notes that it should be reverted when the PowerPC problem was fixed.  The
commit fixing the PowerPC problem (953c66c2b22a) did not revert the
commit; instead setting CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGE_PAGECACHE to the same as
CONFIG_TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE.  Checking with Kirill and Aneesh, this was an
oversight, so remove the Kconfig symbol and undo the work of commit
e496cf3d7821.
