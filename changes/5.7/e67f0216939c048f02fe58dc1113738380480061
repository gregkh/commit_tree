ovl: clear ATTR_FILE from attr->ia_valid

ovl_setattr() can be passed an attr which has ATTR_FILE set and
attr->ia_file is a file pointer to overlay file. This is done in
open(O_TRUNC) path.

We should either replace with attr->ia_file with underlying file object or
clear ATTR_FILE so that underlying filesystem does not end up using
overlayfs file object pointer.

There are no good use cases yet so for now clear ATTR_FILE. fuse seems to
be one user which can use this. But it can work even without this.  So it
is not mandatory to pass ATTR_FILE to fuse.
