net: axienet: Factor out TX descriptor chain cleanup

Factor out the code that cleans up a number of connected TX descriptors,
as we will need it to properly roll back a failed _xmit() call.
There are subtle differences between cleaning up a successfully sent
chain (unknown number of involved descriptors, total data size needed)
and a chain that was about to set up (number of descriptors known), so
cater for those variations with some extra parameters.
