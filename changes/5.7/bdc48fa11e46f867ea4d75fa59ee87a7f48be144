checkpatch/coding-style: deprecate 80-column warning

Yes, staying withing 80 columns is certainly still _preferred_.  But
it's not the hard limit that the checkpatch warnings imply, and other
concerns can most certainly dominate.

Increase the default limit to 100 characters.  Not because 100
characters is some hard limit either, but that's certainly a "what are
you doing" kind of value and less likely to be about the occasional
slightly longer lines.

Miscellanea:

 - to avoid unnecessary whitespace changes in files, checkpatch will no
   longer emit a warning about line length when scanning files unless
   --strict is also used

 - Add a bit to coding-style about alignment to open parenthesis
