brcmfmac: Fix driver crash on USB control transfer timeout

When the control transfer gets timed out, the error status
was returned without killing that urb, this leads to using
the same urb. This issue causes the kernel crash as the same
urb is sumbitted multiple times. The fix is to kill the
urb for timeout transfer before returning error
