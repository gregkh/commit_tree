ceph: simplify calling of ceph_get_fmode()

Originally, calling ceph_get_fmode() for open files is by thread that
handles request reply. There is a small window between updating caps and
and waking the request initiator. We need to prevent ceph_check_caps()
from releasing wanted caps in the window.

Previous patches made fill_inode() call __ceph_touch_fmode() for open file
requests. This prevented ceph_check_caps() from releasing wanted caps for
'caps_wanted_delay_min' seconds, enough for request initiator to get
woken up and call ceph_get_fmode().

This allows us to now call ceph_get_fmode() in ceph_open() instead.
