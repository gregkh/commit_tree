tpm: check event log version before reading final events

This fixes the boot issues since 5.3 on several Dell models when the TPM
is enabled. Depending on the exact grub binary, booting the kernel would
freeze early, or just report an error parsing the final events log.

We get an event log in the SHA-1 format, which doesn't have a
tcg_efi_specid_event_head in the first event, and there is a final events
table which doesn't match the crypto agile format.
__calc_tpm2_event_size reads bad "count" and "efispecid->num_algs", and
either fails, or loops long enough for the machine to be appear frozen.

So we now only parse the final events table, which is per the spec always
supposed to be in the crypto agile format, when we got a event log in this
format.

Fixes: 166a2809d65b2 ("tpm: Don't duplicate events from the final event log in the TCG2 log")
