powerpc/64s/exception: Soft NMI interrupt should not use ret_from_except

The soft NMI handler does not reconcile interrupt state, so it should
not return via the normal ret_from_except path. Return like other NMIs,
using the EXCEPTION_RESTORE_REGS macro.

This becomes important when the scv interrupt is implemented, which
must handle soft-masked interrupts that have r13 set to something
other than the PACA -- returning to kernel in this case must restore
r13.
