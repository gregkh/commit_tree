platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Make pmc_core_substate_res_show() generic

Currently pmc_core_substate_res_show() uses array of char pointers
i.e., lpm_modes for Tiger Lake directly to iterate through and to get
the number of low power modes which is hardcoded and cannot be re-used
for future platforms that support sub-states. To maintain readability,
make pmc_core_substate_res_show() generic, so that it can re-used for
future platforms.
