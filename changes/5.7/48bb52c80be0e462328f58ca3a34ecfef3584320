devlink: Add auto dump flag to health reporter

On low memory system, run time dumps can consume too much memory. Add
administrator ability to disable auto dumps per reporter as part of the
error flow handle routine.

This attribute is not relevant while executing
DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_DUMP_GET.

By default, auto dump is activated for any reporter that has a dump method,
as part of the reporter registration to devlink.
