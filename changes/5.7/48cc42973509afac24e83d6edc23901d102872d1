ALSA: usb-audio: Filter error from connector kctl ops, too

The ignore_ctl_error option should filter the error at kctl accesses,
but there was an overlook: mixer_ctl_connector_get() returns an error
from the request.

This patch covers the forgotten code path and apply filter_error()
properly.  The locking error is still returned since this is a fatal
error that has to be reported even with ignore_ctl_error option.
