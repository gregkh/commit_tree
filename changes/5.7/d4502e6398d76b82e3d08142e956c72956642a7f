ARM: dts: rockchip: swap clocks and clock-names values for i2s nodes

Current dts files with 'i2s' nodes are manually verified.
In order to automate this process rockchip-i2s.txt
has to be converted to yaml. In the new setup dtbs_check with
rockchip-i2s.yaml expect clocks and clock-names values
in the same order. Fix this for some older Rockchip models.

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=Documentation/devicetree/bindings/sound/rockchip-i2s.yaml
