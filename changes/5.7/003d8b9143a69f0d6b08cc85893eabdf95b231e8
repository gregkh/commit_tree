drm/i915/gem: Only call eb_lookup_vma once during execbuf ioctl

As we no longer stash anything inside i915_vma under the exclusive
protection of struct_mutex, we do not need to revoke the i915_vma
stashes before dropping struct_mutex to handle pagefaults. Knowing that
we must drop the struct_mutex while keeping the eb->vma around, means
that we are required to hold onto to the object reference until we have
marked the vma as active.
