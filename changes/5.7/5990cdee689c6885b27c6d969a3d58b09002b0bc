lib/mpi: Fix building for powerpc with clang

0day reports over and over on an powerpc randconfig with clang:

lib/mpi/generic_mpih-mul1.c:37:13: error: invalid use of a cast in a
inline asm context requiring an l-value: remove the cast or build with
-fheinous-gnu-extensions

Remove the superfluous casts, which have been done previously for x86
and arm32 in commit dea632cadd12 ("lib/mpi: fix build with clang") and
commit 7b7c1df2883d ("lib/mpi/longlong.h: fix building with 32-bit
x86").
