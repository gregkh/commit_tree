mmc: sdhci-msm: Deactivate CQE during SDHC reset

When SDHC gets reset (E.g. in runtime suspend path), CQE also gets
reset and goes to disable state. But s/w state still points it as CQE
is in enabled state. Since s/w and h/w states goes out of sync,
it results in s/w request timeout for subsequent CQE requests.

To synchronize CQE s/w and h/w state during SDHC reset,
explicitly deactivate CQE just before SDHC reset.
