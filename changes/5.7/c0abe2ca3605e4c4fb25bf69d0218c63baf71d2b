remoteproc: Traverse rproc_list under RCU read lock

In order to be able to traverse the mostly read-only rproc_list without
locking during panic migrate traversal to be done under rcu_read_lock().

Mutual exclusion for modifications of the list continues to be handled
by the rproc_list_mutex and a synchronization point is added before
releasing objects that are popped from the list.
