torture: Forgive -EBUSY from boottime CPU-hotplug operations

During boot, CPU hotplug is often disabled, for example by PCI probing.
On large systems that take substantial time to boot, this can result
in spurious RCU_HOTPLUG errors.  This commit therefore forgives any
boottime -EBUSY CPU-hotplug failures by adjusting counters to pretend
that the corresponding attempt never happened.  A non-splat record
of the failed attempt is emitted to the console with the added string
"(-EBUSY forgiven during boot)".
