ASoC: convert rockchip spdif bindings to yaml

Current dts files with 'spdif' nodes are manually verified.
In order to automate this process rockchip-spdif.txt
has to be converted to yaml.

Also rk3188.dtsi, rk3288.dtsi use an extra fallback string,
so change this in the documentation.

Changed:
"rockchip,rk3188-spdif", "rockchip,rk3066-spdif"
"rockchip,rk3288-spdif", "rockchip,rk3066-spdif"
