EDAC/synopsys: Do not dump uninitialized pinf->col

On the ZynqMP platform, zynqmp_get_error_info() is used to read out
error information. In this function, the pinf->col parameter is not
used (it is only used by the Zynq platform's zynq_get_error_info()). So
there's no need to print pinf->col on ZynqMP.

In order to differentiate on which platform handle_error() is executed,
use DDR_ECC_INTR_SUPPORT as the check condition to distinguish between
Zynq and ZynqMP platforms.
