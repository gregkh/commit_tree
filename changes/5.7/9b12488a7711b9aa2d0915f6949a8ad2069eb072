userfaultfd: selftests: add write-protect test

Add uffd tests for write protection.

Instead of introducing new tests for it, let's simply squashing uffd-wp
tests into existing uffd-missing test cases.  Changes are:

(1) Bouncing tests

  We do the write-protection in two ways during the bouncing test:

  - By using UFFDIO_COPY_MODE_WP when resolving MISSING pages: then
    we'll make sure for each bounce process every single page will be
    at least fault twice: once for MISSING, once for WP.

  - By direct call UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT on existing faulted memories:
    To further torture the explicit page protection procedures of
    uffd-wp, we split each bounce procedure into two halves (in the
    background thread): the first half will be MISSING+WP for each
    page as explained above.  After the first half, we write protect
    the faulted region in the background thread to make sure at least
    half of the pages will be write protected again which is the first
    half to test the new UFFDIO_WRITEPROTECT call.  Then we continue
    with the 2nd half, which will contain both MISSING and WP faulting
    tests for the 2nd half and WP-only faults from the 1st half.

(2) Event/Signal test

  Mostly previous tests but will do MISSING+WP for each page.  For
  sigbus-mode test we'll need to provide standalone path to handle the
  write protection faults.

For all tests, do statistics as well for uffd-wp pages.
