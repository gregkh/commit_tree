clk: Move rate and accuracy recalc to mostly consumer APIs

There's some confusion about when recalc is done for the rate and
accuracy clk consumer APIs in relation to the prepare lock being taken.
Oddly enough, we take the lock again in debugfs APIs so that we can call
the internal "clk_core" APIs to get these fields with any necessary
recalculations. Instead of having this confusion, let's introduce a
recalc variant of these two consumer APIs as internal helpers and call
them from the consumer APIs and the debugfs code so that we don't take
the lock more than once.
