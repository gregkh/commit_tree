drm/i915/gt: Expose busywait duration to sysfs

We busywait on an inflight request (one that is currently executing on
HW, and so might complete quickly) prior to setting up an interrupt and
sleeping. The trade off is that we keep an expensive CPU core busy in
order to avoid wake up latency: where that trade off should lie is best
left to the sysadmin.

The busywait mechanism can be compiled out with

	./scripts/config --set-val DRM_I915_SPIN_REQUEST 0

The maximum busywait duration can be adjusted per-engine using,

	/sys/class/drm/card?/engine/*/ms_busywait_duration_ns
