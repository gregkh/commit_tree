inet: Use fallthrough;

Convert the various uses of fallthrough comments to fallthrough;

Done via script

And by hand:

net/ipv6/ip6_fib.c has a fallthrough comment outside of an #ifdef block
that causes gcc to emit a warning if converted in-place.

So move the new fallthrough; inside the containing #ifdef/#endif too.
