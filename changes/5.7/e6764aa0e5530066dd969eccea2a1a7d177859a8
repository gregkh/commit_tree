Revert "kobject: Make sure the parent does not get released before its children"

This reverts commit 4ef12f7198023c09ad6d25b652bd8748c965c7fa.

Guenter reports:

	All my arm64be (arm64 big endian) boot tests crash with this
	patch applied. Reverting it fixes the problem. Crash log and
	bisect results (from pending-fixes branch) below.

And also:
	arm64 images don't crash but report lots of "poison overwritten"
	backtraces like the one below. On arm, I see "refcount_t:
	underflow", also attached.  I didn't bisect those, but given the
	context I would suspect the same culprit.
