drm/amd/display: Workaround to do HDCP authentication twice on certain displays

[Why]
When transitioning from SST to MST, the HDCP repeater in some MST
displays will enter a bad state. The HDCP repeater is recovered after
failing and performing authentication again.

[How]
Add monitor patch to trigger HDCP authentication failure after
encryption is enabled and re-authenticate.
