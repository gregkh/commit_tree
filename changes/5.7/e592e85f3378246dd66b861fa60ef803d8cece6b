drm/amd/display: writing stereo polarity register if swapped

[why]
on some displays that prefer swapped polarity we were seeing L/R images
swapped because OTG_STEREO_SYNC_OUTPUT_POLARITY would always be mapped
to 0

[how]
fix initial dal3 implementation to properly update the polarity field
according to the crtc_stereo_flags (same as
OTG_STEREO_EYE_FLAG_POLARITY)
