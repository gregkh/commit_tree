selftests/powerpc: Always build the tm-poison test 64-bit

The tm-poison test includes inline asm which is 64-bit only, so the
test must be built 64-bit in order to work.

Otherwise it fails, eg:
  # file tm-poison
  tm-poison: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, PowerPC or cisco 4500, version 1 (SYSV) ...
  # ./tm-poison
  test: tm_poison_test
  Unknown value 0x1fff71150 leaked into f31!
  Unknown value 0x1fff710c0 leaked into vr31!
  failure: tm_poison_test
