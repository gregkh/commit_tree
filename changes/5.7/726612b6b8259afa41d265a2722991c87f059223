nvme: Make nvme_uninit_ctrl symmetric to nvme_init_ctrl

Put the ctrl reference count at nvme_uninit_ctrl as opposed to
nvme_init_ctrl which takes it. This decrease the reference count at the
core layer instead of decreasing it on each transport separately.
Also move the call of nvme_uninit_ctrl at PCI driver after calling to
nvme_release_prp_pools and nvme_dev_unmap, in order to put the reference
count after using the dev. This is safe because those functions use
nvme_dev which is freed only later at nvme_pci_free_ctrl.
