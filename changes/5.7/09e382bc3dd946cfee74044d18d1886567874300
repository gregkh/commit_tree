This patch does the following to improve RDP processing:

 - Rename field port_id to d_id in ELS and PUREX iocb structs to match FW
   spec.

 - Remove redundant comments from ELS and PUREX iocb structs.

 - Refactor fields in ELS iocb struct for error subcode common access.

 - Properly use error subcode fields in rdp processing routine.

 - Add print logs for alloc failure in purex rdp processing routine.
