s390/kaslr: add support for R_390_JMP_SLOT relocation type

With certain kernel configurations, the R_390_JMP_SLOT relocation type
might be generated, which is not expected by the KASLR relocation code,
and the kernel stops with the message "Unknown relocation type".

This was found with a zfcpdump kernel config, where CONFIG_MODULES=n
and CONFIG_VFIO=n. In that case, symbol_get() is used on undefined
__weak symbols in virt/kvm/vfio.c, which results in the generation
of R_390_JMP_SLOT relocation types.

Fix this by handling R_390_JMP_SLOT similar to R_390_GLOB_DAT.
