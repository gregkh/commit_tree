s390/qeth: allow configuration of TX queues for IQD devices

Similar to the support for z/VM NICs, but we need to take extra care
about the dedicated mcast queue:

1. netdev_pick_tx() is unaware of this limitation and might select the
   mcast txq. Catch this.
2. require at least _two_ TX queues - one for ucast, one for mcast.
3. when reducing the number of TX queues, there's a potential race
   where netdev_cap_txqueue() over-rules the selected txq index and
   falls back to index 0. This would place ucast traffic on the mcast
   queue, and result in TX errors.
   So for IQD, reject a reduction while the interface is running.
