btrfs: free the reloc_control in a consistent way

If we have an error while processing the reloc roots we could leak roots
that were added to rc->reloc_roots before we hit the error.  We could
have also not removed the reloc tree mapping from our rb_tree, so clean
up any remaining nodes in the reloc root rb_tree.
