fanotify: turn off support for FAN_DIR_MODIFY

FAN_DIR_MODIFY has been enabled by commit 44d705b0370b ("fanotify:
report name info for FAN_DIR_MODIFY event") in 5.7-rc1. Now we are
planning further extensions to the fanotify API and during that we
realized that FAN_DIR_MODIFY may behave slightly differently to be more
consistent with extensions we plan. So until we finalize these
extensions, let's not bind our hands with exposing FAN_DIR_MODIFY to
userland.
