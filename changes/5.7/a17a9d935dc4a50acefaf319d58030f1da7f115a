ext4: increase wait time needed before reuse of deleted inode numbers

Current wait times have proven to be too short to protect against inode
reuses that lead to metadata inconsistencies.

Now that we will retry the inode allocation if we can't find any
recently deleted inodes, it's a lot safer to increase the recently
deleted time from 5 seconds to a minute.
