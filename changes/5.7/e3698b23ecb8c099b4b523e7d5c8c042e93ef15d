tools headers: Synchronize linux/bits.h with the kernel sources

To pick up the changes in these csets:

  295bcca84916 ("linux/bits.h: add compile time sanity check of GENMASK inputs")
  3945ff37d2f4 ("linux/bits.h: Extract common header for vDSO")

To address this tools/perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/include/linux/bits.h' differs from latest version at 'include/linux/bits.h'
  diff -u tools/include/linux/bits.h include/linux/bits.h

This clashes with usage of userspace's static_assert(), that, at least
on glibc, is guarded by a ifnded/endif pair, do the same to our copy of
build_bug.h and avoid that diff in check_headers.sh so that we continue
checking for drifts with the kernel sources master copy.

This will all be tested with the set of build containers that includes
uCLibc, musl libc, lots of glibc versions in lots of distros and cross
build environments.

The tools/objtool, tools/bpf, etc were tested as well.
