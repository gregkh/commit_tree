iwlwifi: add mac/rf types and 160MHz to the device tables

Add MAC ID, RF ID and the bit that tells us whether the device can
handle 160MHz bandwidth to the device struct.

This allows us to chose the correct structure and string depending on
these parameters.  Do so for all the 0x2526 devices we already moved
to the new table.
