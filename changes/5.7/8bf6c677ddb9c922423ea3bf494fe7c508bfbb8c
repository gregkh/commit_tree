completion: Use lockdep_assert_RT_in_threaded_ctx() in complete_all()

The warning was intended to spot complete_all() users from hardirq
context on PREEMPT_RT. The warning as-is will also trigger in interrupt
handlers, which are threaded on PREEMPT_RT, which was not intended.

Use lockdep_assert_RT_in_threaded_ctx() which triggers in non-preemptive
context on PREEMPT_RT.
