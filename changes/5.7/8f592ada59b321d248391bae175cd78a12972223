efi/earlycon: Fix early printk for wider fonts

When I play with terminus fonts I noticed the efi early printk does
not work because the earlycon code assumes font width is 8.

Here add the code to adapt with larger fonts.  Tested with all kinds
of kernel built-in fonts on my laptop. Also tested with a local draft
patch for 14x28 !bold terminus font.
