drm/qxl: qxl_release use after free

qxl_release should not be accesses after qxl_push_*_ring_release() calls:
userspace driver can process submitted command quickly, move qxl_release
into release_ring, generate interrupt and trigger garbage collector.

It can lead to crashes in qxl driver or trigger memory corruption
in some kmalloc-192 slab object

Gerd Hoffmann proposes to swap the qxl_release_fence_buffer_objects() +
qxl_push_{cursor,command}_ring_release() calls to close that race window.
