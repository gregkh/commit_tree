btrfs: call btrfs_check_uuid_tree_entry directly in btrfs_uuid_tree_iterate

btrfs_uuid_tree_iterate is called from only once place and its 2nd
argument is always btrfs_check_uuid_tree_entry. Simplify
btrfs_uuid_tree_iterate's signature by removing its 2nd argument and
directly calling btrfs_check_uuid_tree_entry. Also move the latter into
uuid-tree.h. No functional changes.
