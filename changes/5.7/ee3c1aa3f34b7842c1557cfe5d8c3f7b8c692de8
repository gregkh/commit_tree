wireguard: selftests: use newer iproute2 for gcc-10

gcc-10 switched to defaulting to -fno-common, which broke iproute2-5.4.
This was fixed in iproute-5.6, so switch to that. Because we're after a
stable testing surface, we generally don't like to bump these
unnecessarily, but in this case, being able to actually build is a basic
necessity.
