rcu: Add READ_ONCE() to rcu_node ->gp_seq

The rcu_node structure's ->gp_seq field is read locklessly, so this
commit adds the READ_ONCE() to several loads in order to avoid
destructive compiler optimizations.

This data race was reported by KCSAN.  Not appropriate for backporting
because this affects only tracing and warnings.
