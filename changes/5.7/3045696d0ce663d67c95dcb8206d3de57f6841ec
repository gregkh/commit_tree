HID: quirks: Remove ITE 8595 entry from hid_have_special_driver

The ITE 8595 chip used in various 2-in-1 keyboard docks works fine with
the hid-generic driver (minus the RF_KILL key) and also keeps working fine
when swapping drivers, so there is no need to have it in the
hid_have_special_driver list.

Note the other 2 USB ids in hid-ite.c were never added to
hid_have_special_driver.
