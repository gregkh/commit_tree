drm/amdgpu/sriov set driver_table address in VF

With the recent patch to unify VRAM address for driver
table(a83f82e). VF cannot dump table info any more because
SMU_MSG_SetDriverDramAddrHigh/Low were deleted in the
function of smu_update_table.

Therefore, VF also needs to set driver_table address
in smu_hw_init to fix this regression issue.
