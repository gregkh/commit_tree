drm/bridge: sii902x: Select SND_SOC_HDMI_CODEC if SND_SOC is configured

To enable HDMI audio the SND_SOC_HDMI_CODEC needs to be
configured. Enable HDMI audio by selecting SND_SOC_HDMI_CODEC if
SND_SOC is configured. SND_SOC_HDMI_CODEC has no config menu entry and
should be selected automatically by the drivers using it.
