gfs2: If go_sync returns error, withdraw but skip invalidate

Before this patch, if the go_sync operation returned an error during
the do_xmote process (such as unable to sync metadata to the journal)
the code did goto out. That kept the glock locked, so it could not be
given away, which correctly avoids file system corruption. However,
it never set the withdraw bit or requeueing the glock work. So it would
hang forever, unable to ever demote the glock.

This patch changes to goto to a new label, skip_inval, so that errors
from go_sync are treated the same way as errors from go_inval:
The delayed withdraw bit is set and the work is requeued. That way,
the logd should eventually figure out there's a problem and withdraw
properly there.
