docs: deprecated.rst: Add BUG()-family

Linus continues to remind[1] people to stop using the BUG()-family of
functions. We should have this better documented (even if checkpatch.pl
has been warning[2] since 2015), so add more details to deprecated.rst,
as a distinct place to point people to for guidance.
