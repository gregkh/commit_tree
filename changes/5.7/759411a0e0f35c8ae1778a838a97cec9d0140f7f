staging: wlan-ng: Fix third argument going over 80 characters

Create a new 'status' variable to store the value of a long argument
that goes over 80 characters. The status variable is also used for
an if check. Replacing that long statement in both places makes the
code much easier to read.

Note: the status variable is assigned after a needed byte order
conversion for usbin->rxfrm.desc.status, which uses a reference.
