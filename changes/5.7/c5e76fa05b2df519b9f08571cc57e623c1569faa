powerpc/pseries: Fix of_read_drc_info_cell() to point at next record

The expectation is that when calling of_read_drc_info_cell()
repeatedly to parse multiple drc-info records that the in/out curval
parameter points at the start of the next record on return. However,
the current behavior has curval still pointing at the final value of
the record just parsed. The result of which is that if the
ibm,drc-info property contains multiple properties the parsed value
of the drc_type for any record after the first has the power_domain
value of the previous record appended to the type string.

eg: observed the following 0xffffffff prepended to PHB

  drc-info: type: \xff\xff\xff\xffPHB, prefix: PHB , index_start: 0x20000001
  drc-info: suffix_start: 1, sequential_elems: 3072, sequential_inc: 1
  drc-info: power-domain: 0xffffffff, last_index: 0x20000c00

In practice PHBs are the only type of connector in the ibm,drc-info
property that has multiple records. So, it breaks PHB hotplug, but by
chance not PCI, CPU, slot, or memory because they happen to only ever
be a single record.

Fix by incrementing curval past the power_domain value to point at
drc_type string of next record.
