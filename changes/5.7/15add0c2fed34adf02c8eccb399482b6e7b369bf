drm/amd/display: Add initialitions for PLL2 clock source

[Why]
Starting from 14nm, the PLL is built into the PHY and the PLL is mapped
to PHY on 1 to 1 basis. In the code, the DP port is mapped to a PLL that was not
initialized. This causes DP to HDMI dongle to not light up the display.

[How]
Initializations added for PLL2 when creating resources.
