drm: Release filp before global lock

The file is not part of the global drm resource and can be released
prior to take the global mutex to drop the open_count (and potentially
close) the drm device. As the global mutex is indeed global, not only
within the device but across devices, a slow file release mechanism can
bottleneck the entire system.

However, inside drm_close_helper() there are a number of dev->driver
callbacks that take the drm_device as the first parameter... Worryingly
some of those callbacks may be (implicitly) depending on the global
mutex.

v2: Drop the debug message for the open-count, it's included with the
drm_file_free() debug message -- and for good measure make that up as
reading outside of the mutex.

v3: Separate the calling of the filp cleanup outside of
drm_global_mutex into a new drm_release_noglobal() hook, so that we can
phase the transition. drm/savage relies on the global mutex, and there
may be more, so be cautious.
