stmmac: fix pointer check after utilization in stmmac_interrupt

The paranoidal pointer check in IRQ handler looks very strange - it
really protects us only against bogus drivers which request IRQ line
with null pointer dev_id. However, the code fragment is incorrect
because the dev pointer is used before the actual check which leads
to undefined behavior. Remove the check to avoid confusing people
with incorrect code.
