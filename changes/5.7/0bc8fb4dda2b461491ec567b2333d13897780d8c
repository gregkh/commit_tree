um: Implement ndelay/udelay in time-travel mode

In external or inf-cpu time-travel mode, ndelay/udelay currently
just waste CPU time since the simulation time doesn't advance.
Implement them properly in this case.

Note that the "if (time_travel_mode == ...)" parts compile out
if CONFIG_UML_TIME_TRAVEL_SUPPORT isn't set, time_travel_mode is
defined to TT_MODE_OFF in that case.
