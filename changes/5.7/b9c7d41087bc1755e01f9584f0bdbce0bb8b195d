ALSA: pcm: More helper macros for reducing snd_pcm_format_t cast

snd_pcm_format_t is a strong-typed integer and requires the explicit
cast with __force if converted or compared with a normal integer
value.  Since most of use cases do iterate over all formats and test /
set the mask, provide a couple of new helper macros that do the
explicit cast.
