ARC: Fix ICCM & DCCM runtime size checks

As of today the ICCM and DCCM size checks are incorrectly using
mismatched units (KiB checked against bytes). The CONFIG_ARC_DCCM_SZ
and CONFIG_ARC_ICCM_SZ are in KiB, but the size calculated in
runtime and stored in cpu->dccm.sz and cpu->iccm.sz is in bytes.

Fix that.
