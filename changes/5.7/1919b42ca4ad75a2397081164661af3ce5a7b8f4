ASoC: SOF: ipc: check ipc return value before data copy

In tx_wait_done the ipc payload is copied before the DSP transaction
error code is checked. This might lead to corrupted data in kernel side
even though the error would be handled later. It is also pointless to
copy the data in case of error. So change the order of error check and
copy.
