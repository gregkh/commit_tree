drm/i915/gt: Expose timeslice duration to sysfs

Execlists uses a scheduling quantum (a timeslice) to alternate execution
between ready-to-run contexts of equal priority. This ensures that all
users (though only if they of equal importance) have the opportunity to
run and prevents livelocks where contexts may have implicit ordering due
to userspace semaphores.

The timeslicing mechanism can be compiled out with

	./scripts/config --set-val DRM_I915_TIMESLICE_DURATION 0

The timeslice duration can be adjusted per-engine using,

	/sys/class/drm/card?/engine/*/timeslice_duration_ms
