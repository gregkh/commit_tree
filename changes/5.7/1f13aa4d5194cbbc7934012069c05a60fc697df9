ARM: 8973/1: Add missing newline terminator to kernel message

Before commit 874f9c7da9a4acbc ("printk: create pr_<level> functions"),
pr_*() calls without a trailing newline characters would be printed with
a newline character appended, both on the console and in the output of
the dmesg command.

After that commit, no new line character is appended, and the output of
the next pr_*() call of the same type may be appended:

    -No ATAGs?
    -hw-breakpoint: found 5 (+1 reserved) breakpoint and 4 watchpoint registers.
    +No ATAGs?hw-breakpoint: found 5 (+1 reserved) breakpoint and 4 watchpoint registers.

While this commit has been reverted in commit a0cba2179ea4c182 ("Revert
"printk: create pr_<level> functions""), it's still good practice to
terminate kernel messages with newlines.
