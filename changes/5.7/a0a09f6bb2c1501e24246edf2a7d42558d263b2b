devlink: convert snapshot destructor callback to region op

It does not makes sense that two snapshots for a given region would use
different destructors. Simplify snapshot creation by adding
a .destructor op for regions.

This operation will replace the data_destructor for the snapshot
creation, and makes snapshot creation easier.
