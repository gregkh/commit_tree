KVM: arm64: vgic-v4: Initialize GICv4.1 even in the absence of a virtual ITS

KVM now expects to be able to use HW-accelerated delivery of vSGIs
as soon as the guest has enabled thm. Unfortunately, we only
initialize the GICv4 context if we have a virtual ITS exposed to
the guest.

Fix it by always initializing the GICv4.1 context if it is
available on the host.
