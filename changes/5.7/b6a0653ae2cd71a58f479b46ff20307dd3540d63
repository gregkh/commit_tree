KVM: nVMX: properly handle errors in nested_vmx_handle_enlightened_vmptrld()

nested_vmx_handle_enlightened_vmptrld() fails in two cases:
- when we fail to kvm_vcpu_map() the supplied GPA
- when revision_id is incorrect.
Genuine Hyper-V raises #UD in the former case (at least with *some*
incorrect GPAs) and does VMfailInvalid() in the later. KVM doesn't do
anything so L1 just gets stuck retrying the same faulty VMLAUNCH.

nested_vmx_handle_enlightened_vmptrld() has two call sites:
nested_vmx_run() and nested_get_vmcs12_pages(). The former needs to queue
do much: the failure there happens after migration when L2 was running (and
L1 did something weird like wrote to VP assist page from a different vCPU),
just kill L1 with KVM_EXIT_INTERNAL_ERROR.
