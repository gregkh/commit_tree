platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Dump low power status registers on an S0ix.y failure

Platforms prior to Tiger Lake has no sub-states of S0ix and accessing
device PM states that are latched whenever there is a PC10 entry is
possible with the help of slp_s0_debug_status and slp_s0_dbg_latch
debugfs entries.

If a platform has sub-states of S0ix, no such entries are created.
Hence, dump low power status registers on resume When any attempt to
enter any low power state was unsuccessful.
