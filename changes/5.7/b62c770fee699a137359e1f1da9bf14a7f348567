ACPI: Update Tiger Lake ACPI device IDs

Tiger Lake's new unique ACPI device IDs for DPTF and fan drivers are not
valid as the IDs are missing 'C'. Fix the IDs by updating them.

After the update, the new IDs should now look like
INT1047 --> INTC1047
INT1040 --> INTC1040
INT1043 --> INTC1043
INT1044 --> INTC1044
