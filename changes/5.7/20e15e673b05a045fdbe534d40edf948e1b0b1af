PCI/AER: Add pci_aer_raw_clear_status() to unconditionally clear Error Status

Per the SFI _OSC and DPC Updates ECN [1] implementation note flowchart, the
OS seems to be expected to clear AER status even if it doesn't have
ownership of the AER capability.  Unlike the DPC capability, where a DPC
ECN [2] specifies a window when the OS is allowed to access DPC registers
even if it doesn't have ownership, there is no clear model for AER.

Add pci_aer_raw_clear_status() to clear the AER error status registers
unconditionally.  This is intended for use only by the EDR path (see [2]).
