net: bareudp: avoid uninitialized variable warning

clang points out that building without IPv6 would lead to returning
an uninitialized variable if a packet with family!=AF_INET is
passed into bareudp_udp_encap_recv():

drivers/net/bareudp.c:139:6: error: variable 'err' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false [-Werror,-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
        if (family == AF_INET)
            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/net/bareudp.c:146:15: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        if (unlikely(err)) {
                     ^~~
include/linux/compiler.h:78:42: note: expanded from macro 'unlikely'
 # define unlikely(x)    __builtin_expect(!!(x), 0)
                                            ^
drivers/net/bareudp.c:139:2: note: remove the 'if' if its condition is always true
        if (family == AF_INET)
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This cannot happen in practice, so change the condition in a way that
gcc sees the IPv4 case as unconditionally true here.
For consistency, change all the similar constructs in this file the
same way, using "if(IS_ENABLED())" instead of #if IS_ENABLED()".
