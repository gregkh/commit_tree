objtool: Support Clang non-section symbols in ORC dump

Historically, the relocation symbols for ORC entries have only been
section symbols:

  .text+0: sp:sp+8 bp:(und) type:call end:0

However, the Clang assembler is aggressive about stripping section
symbols.  In that case we will need to use function symbols:

  freezing_slow_path+0: sp:sp+8 bp:(und) type:call end:0

In preparation for the generation of such entries in "objtool orc
generate", add support for reading them in "objtool orc dump".
