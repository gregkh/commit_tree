arm64: ftrace: Correct annotation of ftrace_caller assembly

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotation of assembly
functions new macros have been introduced. These replace ENTRY and
ENDPROC with two different annotations for normal functions and those
with unusual calling conventions.

The patchable function entry versions of ftrace_*_caller don't follow the
usual AAPCS rules, pushing things onto the stack which they don't clean up,
and therefore should be annotated as code rather than functions.
