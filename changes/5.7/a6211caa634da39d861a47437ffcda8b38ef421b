net: revert "net: get rid of an signed integer overflow in ip_idents_reserve()"

Commit adb03115f459 ("net: get rid of an signed integer overflow in ip_idents_reserve()")
used atomic_cmpxchg to replace "atomic_add_return" inside the function
"ip_idents_reserve". The reason was to avoid UBSAN warning.
However, this change has caused performance degrade and in GCC-8,
fno-strict-overflow is now mapped to -fwrapv -fwrapv-pointer
and signed integer overflow is now undefined by default at all
optimization levels[1]. Moreover, it was a bug in UBSAN vs -fwrapv
/-fno-strict-overflow, so Let's revert it safely.
