device_cgroup: Cleanup cgroup eBPF device filter code

Original cgroup v2 eBPF code for filtering device access made it
possible to compile with CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE=n and still use the eBPF
filtering. Change
commit 4b7d4d453fc4 ("device_cgroup: Export devcgroup_check_permission")
reverted this, making it required to set it to y.

Since the device filtering (and all the docs) for cgroup v2 is no longer
a "device controller" like it was in v1, someone might compile their
kernel with CONFIG_CGROUP_DEVICE=n. Then (for linux 5.5+) the eBPF
filter will not be invoked, and all processes will be allowed access
to all devices, no matter what the eBPF filter says.
