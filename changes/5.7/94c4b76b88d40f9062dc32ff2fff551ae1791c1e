KVM: selftests: Introduce steal-time test

The steal-time test confirms what is reported to the guest as stolen
time is consistent with the run_delay reported for the VCPU thread
on the host. Both x86_64 and AArch64 have the concept of steal/stolen
time so this test is introduced for both architectures.

While adding the test we ensure .gitignore has all tests listed
(it was missing s390x/resets) and that the Makefile has all tests
listed in alphabetical order (not really necessary, but it almost
was already...). We also extend the common API with a new num-guest-
pages call and a new timespec call.
