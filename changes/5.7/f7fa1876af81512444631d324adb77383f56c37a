MAINTAINERS: update email address for Naoya Horiguchi

My email address has changed due to system upgrade, so please update it
in MAINTAINERS list.  My old address (n-horiguchi@ah.jp.nec.com) will be
still active for a few months.

Note that my email system has some encoding issue and can't send patches
in raw format via git-send-email.  So patches from me will be delivered
via my free address (nao.horiguchi@gmail.com) or GitHub.
