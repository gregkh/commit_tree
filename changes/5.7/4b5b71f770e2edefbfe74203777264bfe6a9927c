net: tc35815: Fix phydev supported/advertising mask

Commit 3c1bcc8614db ("net: ethernet: Convert phydev advertize and
supported from u32 to link mode") updated ethernet drivers to use a
linkmode bitmap. It mistakenly dropped a bitwise negation in the
tc35815 ethernet driver on a bitmask to set the supported/advertising
flags.

Found by Anthony via code inspection, not tested as I do not have the
required hardware.
