drm/edid: Document why we don't bounds check the DispID CEA block start/end

After much head scratching I managed to convince myself that
for_each_displayid_db() has already done the bounds checks for
the DispID CEA data block. Which is why we don't need to repeat
them in cea_db_offsets(). To avoid having to go through that
pain again in the future add a comment which explains this fact.
