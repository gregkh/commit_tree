mac80211: fix 11w when using encapsulation offloading

The 802.11 encapsulation returned early when setting up the keys in case
offloading was enabled. This causes ieee802.11w to not work anymore. Fix
this by moving the check for offloading into the switch/case construct and
allowing CCMP/GCMP keys. With this patch applied ieee80211w works again
when enabling offloading.
