ucount: Make sure ucounts in /proc/sys/user don't regress again

Commit 769071ac9f20 "ns: Introduce Time Namespace" broke reporting of
inotify ucounts (max_inotify_instances, max_inotify_watches) in
/proc/sys/user because it has added UCOUNT_TIME_NAMESPACES into enum
ucount_type but didn't properly update reporting in
kernel/ucount.c:setup_userns_sysctls(). This problem got fixed in commit
eeec26d5da82 "time/namespace: Add max_time_namespaces ucount".

Add BUILD_BUG_ON to catch a similar problem in the future.
