cifs: fix uninitialised lease_key in open_shroot()

SMB2_open_init() expects a pre-initialised lease_key when opening a
file with a lease, so set pfid->lease_key prior to calling it in
open_shroot().

This issue was observed when performing some DFS failover tests and
the lease key was never randomly generated.
