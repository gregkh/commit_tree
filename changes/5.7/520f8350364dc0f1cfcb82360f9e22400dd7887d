drm/i915: properly sanity check batch_start_offset

Check the edge case where batch_start_offset sits exactly on the batch
size.

v2: add new range_overflows variant to capture the special case where
the size is permitted to be zero, like with batch_len.

v3: other way around. the common case is the exclusive one which should
just be >=, with that we then just need to convert the three odd ball
cases that don't apply to use the new inclusive _end version.

Testcase: igt/gem_exec_params/invalid-batch-start-offset
