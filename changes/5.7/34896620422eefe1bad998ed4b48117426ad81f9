PM: QoS: Drop debugfs interface

After commit c3082a674f46 ("PM: QoS: Get rid of unused flags") the
only global PM QoS class in use is PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY and the
existing PM QoS debugfs interface has become overly complicated (as
it takes other potentially possible PM QoS classes that are not there
any more into account).  It is also not particularly useful (the
"type" of the PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY is known, its aggregate value
can be read from /dev/cpu_dma_latency and the number of requests in
the queue does not really matter) and there are no known users
depending on it.  Moreover, there are dedicated trace events that
can be used for tracking PM QoS usage with much higher precision.

For these reasons, drop the PM QoS debugfs interface altogether.
