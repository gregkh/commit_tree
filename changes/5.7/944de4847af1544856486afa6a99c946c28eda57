net: hns3: fix RSS config lost after VF reset.

Currently, VF's RSS configuration would be set to default
after VF reset, the the user's one will loss.

To fix it, this patch separates hclgevf_rss_init_hw() into
two parts, one sets up the default RSS configuration and
just be called when driver loading, one configures the hardware
and be called by driver loading or reset.
