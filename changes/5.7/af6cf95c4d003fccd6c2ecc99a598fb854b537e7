powerpc/maple: Fix declaration made after definition

When building ppc64 defconfig, Clang errors (trimmed for brevity):

  arch/powerpc/platforms/maple/setup.c:365:1: error: attribute declaration
  must precede definition [-Werror,-Wignored-attributes]
  machine_device_initcall(maple, maple_cpc925_edac_setup);
  ^

machine_device_initcall expands to __define_machine_initcall, which in
turn has the macro machine_is used in it, which declares mach_##name
with an __attribute__((weak)). define_machine actually defines
mach_##name, which in this file happens before the declaration, hence
the warning.

To fix this, move define_machine after machine_device_initcall so that
the declaration occurs before the definition, which matches how
machine_device_initcall and define_machine work throughout
arch/powerpc.

While we're here, remove some spaces before tabs.
