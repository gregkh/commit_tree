media: m88ds3103: Add support for ds3103b demod

The ds3103b demodulator identifies as an m88rs600, but requires different
clock settings and firmware, along with differences in register settings.

Changes were reverse engineered using an instrumented downstream GPLv2
driver to compare i2c traffic and clocking. The mclk functions are from
the downstream GPLv2 driver.
