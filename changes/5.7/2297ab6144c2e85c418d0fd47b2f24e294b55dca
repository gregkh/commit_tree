gfs2: Fix problems regarding gfs2_qa_get and _put

This patch fixes a couple of places in which gfs2_qa_get and gfs2_qa_put are
not balanced: we now keep references around whenever a file is open for writing
(see gfs2_open_common and gfs2_release), so we need to put all references we
grab in function gfs2_create_inode.  This was broken in the successful case and
on one error path.

This also means that we don't have a reference to put in gfs2_evict_inode.

In addition, gfs2_qa_put was called for the wrong inode in gfs2_link.
