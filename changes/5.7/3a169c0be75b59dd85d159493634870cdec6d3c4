xen/blkfront: fix memory allocation flags in blkfront_setup_indirect()

Commit 1d5c76e664333 ("xen-blkfront: switch kcalloc to kvcalloc for
large array allocation") didn't fix the issue it was meant to, as the
flags for allocating the memory are GFP_NOIO, which will lead the
memory allocation falling back to kmalloc().

So instead of GFP_NOIO use GFP_KERNEL and do all the memory allocation
in blkfront_setup_indirect() in a memalloc_noio_{save,restore} section.
