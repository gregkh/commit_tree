dmaengine: owl: Use correct lock in owl_dma_get_pchan()

When the kernel is built with lockdep support and the owl-dma driver is
used, the following message is shown:

The obvious fix would be to use 'spin_lock_init()' on 'pchan->lock'
before attempting to call 'spin_lock_irqsave()' in 'owl_dma_get_pchan()'.

However, according to Manivannan Sadhasivam, 'pchan->lock' was supposed
to only protect 'pchan->vchan' while 'od->lock' does a similar job in
'owl_dma_terminate_pchan()'.

Therefore, this patch substitutes 'pchan->lock' with 'od->lock' and
removes the 'lock' attribute in 'owl_dma_pchan' struct.
