media: aspeed: Use runtime configuration

The aspeed video IP has some differences between SoC families. Currently
the driver decides which registers to use at compile time, which means
a single kernel can not be used between platforms.

Switch to using runtime configuration of the registers that vary between
SoC families. This is in preparation for upcoming ast2600 support.
