x86/Hyper-V: Report crash register data when sysctl_record_panic_msg is not set

When sysctl_record_panic_msg is not set, the panic will
not be reported to Hyper-V via hyperv_report_panic_msg().
So the crash should be reported via hyperv_report_panic().

Fixes: 81b18bce48af ("Drivers: HV: Send one page worth of kmsg dump over Hyper-V during panic")
