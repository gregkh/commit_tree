PM: QoS: Drop PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY notifier chain

Notice that pm_qos_remove_notifier() is not used at all and the only
caller of pm_qos_add_notifier() is the cpuidle core, which only needs
the PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY notifier to invoke wake_up_all_idle_cpus()
upon changes of the PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY target value.

First, to ensure that wake_up_all_idle_cpus() will be called
whenever the PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY target value changes, modify the
pm_qos_add/update/remove_request() family of functions to check if
the effective constraint for the PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY has changed
and call wake_up_all_idle_cpus() directly in that case.

Next, drop the PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY notifier from cpuidle as it is
not necessary any more.

Finally, drop both pm_qos_add_notifier() and pm_qos_remove_notifier(),
as they have no callers now, along with cpu_dma_lat_notifier which is
only used by them.
