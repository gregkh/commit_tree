mm/sparse.c: allocate memmap preferring the given node

When allocating memmap for hot added memory with the classic sparse, the
specified 'nid' is ignored in populate_section_memmap().

While in allocating memmap for the classic sparse during boot, the node
given by 'nid' is preferred.  And VMEMMAP prefers the node of 'nid' in
both boot stage and memory hot adding.  So seems no reason to not respect
the node of 'nid' for the classic sparse when hot adding memory.

Use kvmalloc_node instead to use the passed in 'nid'.
