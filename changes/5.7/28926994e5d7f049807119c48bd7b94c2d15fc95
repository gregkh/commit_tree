usb: host: fhci-hcd: annotate PIPE_CONTROL switch case with fallthrough

After this was made buildable for something other than PPC32, kbuild
starts warning

drivers/usb/host/fhci-hcd.c:398:8: warning: this statement may fall
through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

I don't know this code, but from the construction (initializing size
with 0 and explicitly using "size +=" in the PIPE_BULK case) I assume
that fallthrough is indeed intended.
