clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Do not update counter on updating the period

Write to trigger register(OMAP_TIMER_TRIGGER_REG) will load the value
in Load register(OMAP_TIMER_LOAD_REG) into Counter register
(OMAP_TIMER_COUNTER_REG).

omap_dm_timer_set_load() writes into trigger register every time load
register is updated. When timer is configured in pwm mode, this causes
disruption in current pwm cycle, which is not expected especially when
pwm is used as PPS signal for synchronized PTP clocks. So do not write
into trigger register on updating the period.
