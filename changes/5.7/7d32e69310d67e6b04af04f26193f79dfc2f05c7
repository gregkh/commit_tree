kbuild, btf: Fix dependencies for DEBUG_INFO_BTF

Currently turning on DEBUG_INFO_SPLIT when DEBUG_INFO_BTF is also
enabled will produce invalid btf file, since gen_btf function in
link-vmlinux.sh script doesn't handle *.dwo files.

Enabling DEBUG_INFO_REDUCED will also produce invalid btf file,
and using GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT with BTF makes no sense.
