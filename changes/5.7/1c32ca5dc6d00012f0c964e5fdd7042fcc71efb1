KVM: arm: vgic: Fix limit condition when writing to GICD_I[CS]ACTIVER

When deciding whether a guest has to be stopped we check whether this
is a private interrupt or not. Unfortunately, there's an off-by-one bug
here, and we fail to recognize a whole range of interrupts as being
global (GICv2 SPIs 32-63).

Fix the condition from > to be >=.
