net: dsa: sja1105: the PTP_CLK extts input reacts on both edges

It looks like the sja1105 external timestamping input is not as generic
as we thought. When fed a signal with 50% duty cycle, it will timestamp
both the rising and the falling edge. When fed a short pulse signal,
only the timestamp of the falling edge will be seen in the PTPSYNCTS
register, because that of the rising edge had been overwritten. So the
moral is: don't feed it short pulse inputs.

Luckily this is not a complete deal breaker, as we can still work with
1 Hz square waves. But the problem is that the extts polling period was
not dimensioned enough for this input signal. If we leave the period at
half a second, we risk losing timestamps due to jitter in the measuring
process. So we need to increase it to 4 times per second.

Also, the very least we can do to inform the user is to deny any other
flags combination than with PTP_RISING_EDGE and PTP_FALLING_EDGE both
set.
