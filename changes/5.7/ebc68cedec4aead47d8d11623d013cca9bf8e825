Input: i8042 - add Acer Aspire 5738z to nomux list

The Acer Aspire 5738z has a button to disable (and re-enable) the
touchpad next to the touchpad.

When this button is pressed a LED underneath indicates that the touchpad
is disabled (and an event is send to userspace and GNOME shows its
touchpad enabled / disable OSD thingie).

So far so good, but after re-enabling the touchpad it no longer works.

The laptop does not have an external ps2 port, so mux mode is not needed
and disabling mux mode fixes the touchpad no longer working after toggling
it off and back on again, so lets add this laptop model to the nomux list.
