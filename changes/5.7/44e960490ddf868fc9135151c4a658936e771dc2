driver core: Fix handling of SYNC_STATE_ONLY + STATELESS device links

Commit 21c27f06587d ("driver core: Fix SYNC_STATE_ONLY device link
implementation") didn't completely fix STATELESS + SYNC_STATE_ONLY
handling.

What looks like an optimization in that commit is actually a bug that
causes an if condition to always take the else path. This prevents
reordering of devices in the dpm_list when a DL_FLAG_STATELESS device
link is create on top of an existing DL_FLAG_SYNC_STATE_ONLY device
link.
