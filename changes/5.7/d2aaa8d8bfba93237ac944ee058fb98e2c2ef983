ASoC: soc-pcm: fix state tracking error in snd_soc_component_open/close()

ASoC component open/close and snd_soc_component_module_get/put are called
independently for each component-substream pair, so the logic added in
commit dd03907bf129 ("ASoC: soc-pcm: call snd_soc_component_open/close()
once") was not sufficient and led to PCM playback and module unload errors.

Implement handling of failures directly in soc_pcm_components_open(),
so that any successfully opened components are closed upon error with
other components. This allows to clean up error handling in
soc_pcm_open() without adding more state tracking.
