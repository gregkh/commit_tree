staging: wfx: fix init/remove vs IRQ race

Current code races in init/exit with interrupt handlers. This is noticed
by the warning below. Fix it by using devres for ordering allocations and
IRQ de/registration.

WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 827 at drivers/staging/wfx/bus_spi.c:142 wfx_spi_irq_handler+0x5c/0x64 [wfx]
race condition in driver init/deinit
