sched/fair: Enable tuning of decay period

Thermal pressure follows pelt signals which means the decay period for
thermal pressure is the default pelt decay period. Depending on SoC
characteristics and thermal activity, it might be beneficial to decay
thermal pressure slower, but still in-tune with the pelt signals.  One way
to achieve this is to provide a command line parameter to set a decay
shift parameter to an integer between 0 and 10.
