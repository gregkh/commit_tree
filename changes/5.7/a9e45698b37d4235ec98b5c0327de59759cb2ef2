Bluetooth: Remove adv set for directed advertising

Extended advertising Data is set during bluetooth initialization
by default which causes InvalidHCICommandParameters when setting
Extended advertising parameters.

As per Core Spec 5.2 Vol 2, PART E, Sec 7.8.53, for
advertising_event_property LE_LEGACY_ADV_DIRECT_IND does not
supports advertising data when the advertising set already
contains some, the controller shall return erroc code
'InvalidHCICommandParameters(0x12).

So it is required to remove adv set for handle 0x00. since we use
instance 0 for directed adv.
