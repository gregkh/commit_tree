x86/split_lock: Provide handle_guest_split_lock()

Without at least minimal handling for split lock detection induced #AC,
VMX will just run into the same problem as the VMWare hypervisor, which
was reported by Kenneth.

It will inject the #AC blindly into the guest whether the guest is
prepared or not.

Provide a function for guest mode which acts depending on the host
SLD mode. If mode == sld_warn, treat it like user space, i.e. emit a
warning, disable SLD and mark the task accordingly. Otherwise force
SIGBUS.

 [ bp: Add a !CPU_SUP_INTEL stub for handle_guest_split_lock(). ]
