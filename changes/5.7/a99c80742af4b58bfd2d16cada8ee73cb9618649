scsi: lpfc: Fix compiler warning on frame size

The following error is see from the compiler:

  drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c: In function
    ‘lpfc_cpuhp_get_eq’: drivers/scsi/lpfc/lpfc_init.c:12660:1:
      error: the frame size of 1032 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes
         [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

The issue is due to allocating a cpumask on the stack.

Fix by converting to a dynamical allocation of the cpu mask.
