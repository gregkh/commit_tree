buffer: remove useless comment and WB_REASON_FREE_MORE_MEM, reason.

free_more_memory func has been completely removed in commit bc48f001de12
("buffer: eliminate the need to call free_more_memory() in __getblk_slow()")

So comment and `WB_REASON_FREE_MORE_MEM` reason about free_more_memory
are no longer needed.
