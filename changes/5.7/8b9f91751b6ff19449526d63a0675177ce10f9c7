media: vimc: streamer: if kthread_stop fails, ignore the error

Ignore errors returned from kthread_stop since the
vimc subdevices should still be notified that
streaming stopped so they can release the memory for
the streaming, and also kthread should be set to NULL.
kthread_stop can return -EINTR in case the thread
did not yet run. This can happen if userspace calls
streamon and streamoff right after.
