libbpf: Fix bpf_get_link_xdp_id flags handling

Currently if one of XDP_FLAGS_{DRV,HW,SKB}_MODE flags is passed to
bpf_get_link_xdp_id() and there is a single XDP program attached to
ifindex, that program's id will be returned by bpf_get_link_xdp_id() in
prog_id argument no matter what mode the program is attached in, i.e.
flags argument is not taken into account.

For example, if there is a single program attached with
XDP_FLAGS_SKB_MODE but user calls bpf_get_link_xdp_id() with flags =
XDP_FLAGS_DRV_MODE, that skb program will be returned.

Fix it by returning info->prog_id only if user didn't specify flags. If
flags is specified then return corresponding mode-specific-field from
struct xdp_link_info.

The initial error was introduced in commit 50db9f073188 ("libbpf: Add a
support for getting xdp prog id on ifindex") and then refactored in
473f4e133a12 so 473f4e133a12 is used in the Fixes tag.

Fixes: 473f4e133a12 ("libbpf: Add bpf_get_link_xdp_info() function to get more XDP information")
