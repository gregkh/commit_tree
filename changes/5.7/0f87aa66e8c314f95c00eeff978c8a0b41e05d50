serial: sunhv: Initialize lock for non-registered console

The commit a3cb39d258ef
("serial: core: Allow detach and attach serial device for console")
changed a bit logic behind lock initialization since for most of the console
driver it's supposed to have lock already initialized even if console is not
enabled. However, it's not the case for Sparc HV console.

Initialize lock explicitly in the ->probe().

Note, there is still an open question should or shouldn't not this driver
register console properly.
