sched/fair: Fix unthrottle_cfs_rq() for leaf_cfs_rq list

Although not exactly identical, unthrottle_cfs_rq() and enqueue_task_fair()
are quite close and follow the same sequence for enqueuing an entity in the
cfs hierarchy. Modify unthrottle_cfs_rq() to use the same pattern as
enqueue_task_fair(). This fixes a problem already faced with the latter and
add an optimization in the last for_each_sched_entity loop.
