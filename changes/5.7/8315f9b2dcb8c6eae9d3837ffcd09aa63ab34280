octeontx2-af: Set discovery ID for RVUM block

Currently there is no way for AF dependent drivers in
any domain to check if the AF driver is loaded. This
patch sets an ID for RVUM block which will automatically
reflects in PF/VFs discovery register which they can
check and defer their probe until AF is up.
