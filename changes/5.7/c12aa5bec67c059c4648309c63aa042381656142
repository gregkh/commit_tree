usb: musb: jz4740: Unconditionally depend on devicetree

The jz4740-musb driver is unconditionally probed from devicetree, so we
can add a hard dependency on devicetree. This makes the code a bit
cleaner, and is more future-proof as the platform data is now retrieved
using of_device_get_match_data().
