scsi: bnx2fc: Process the RQE with CQE in interrupt context

Filesystem goes to read-only after continuous error injection because RQE
was handled in deferred context, leading to mismatch between CQE and RQE.

Specifically, this patch makes the following changes:

 - Process the RQE with CQE in interrupt context, before putting it into
   the work queue.

 - Producer and consumer indices are also updated in the interrupt context
   to guarantee the the order of processing.
