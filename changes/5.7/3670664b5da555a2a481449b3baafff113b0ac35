tty: evh_bytechan: Fix out of bounds accesses

ev_byte_channel_send() assumes that its third argument is a 16 byte
array. Some places where it is called it may not be (or we can't
easily tell if it is). Newer compilers have started producing warnings
about this, so make sure we actually pass a 16 byte array.

There may be more elegant solutions to this, but the driver is quite
old and hasn't been updated in many years.

The warnings (from a powerpc allyesconfig build) are:
