drm/bridge: synopsys: dw-hdmi: allow ycbcr420 modes for >= 0x200a

Now the DW-HDMI Controller supports the HDMI2.0 modes, enable support
for these modes in the connector if the platform supports them.
We limit these modes to DW-HDMI IP version >= 0x200a which
are designed to support HDMI2.0 display modes.
