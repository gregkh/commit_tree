net/mlx5e: Fix MLX5_TC_CT dependencies

Change MLX5_TC_CT config dependencies to include MLX5_ESWITCH instead of
MLX5_CORE_EN && NET_SWITCHDEV, which are already required by MLX5_ESWITCH.
Without this change mlx5 fails to compile if user disables MLX5_ESWITCH
without also manually disabling MLX5_TC_CT.
