dmaengine: tegra210-adma: Fix an error handling path in 'tegra_adma_probe()'

Commit b53611fb1ce9 ("dmaengine: tegra210-adma: Fix crash during probe")
has moved some code in the probe function and reordered the error handling
path accordingly.
However, a goto has been missed.

Fix it and goto the right label if 'dma_async_device_register()' fails, so
that all resources are released.
