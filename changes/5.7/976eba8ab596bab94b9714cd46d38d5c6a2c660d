ip_vti: receive ipip packet by calling ip_tunnel_rcv

In Commit dd9ee3444014 ("vti4: Fix a ipip packet processing bug in
'IPCOMP' virtual tunnel"), it tries to receive IPIP packets in vti
by calling xfrm_input(). This case happens when a small packet or
frag sent by peer is too small to get compressed.

However, xfrm_input() will still get to the IPCOMP path where skb
sec_path is set, but never dropped while it should have been done
in vti_ipcomp4_protocol.cb_handler(vti_rcv_cb), as it's not an
ipcomp4 packet. This will cause that the packet can never pass
xfrm4_policy_check() in the upper protocol rcv functions.

So this patch is to call ip_tunnel_rcv() to process IPIP packets
instead.
