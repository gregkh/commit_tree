uio: add resource managed devm_uio_register_device() function

This change adds a resource managed equivalent of uio_register_device().
Not adding devm_uio_unregister_device(), since the intent is to discourage
it's usage. Having such a function may allow some bad driver designs. Most
users of devm_*register*() functions rarely use the unregister equivalents.
