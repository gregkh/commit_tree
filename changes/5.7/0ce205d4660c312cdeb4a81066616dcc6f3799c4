net: macb: Fix runtime PM refcounting

The commit e6a41c23df0d, while trying to fix an issue,

    ("net: macb: ensure interface is not suspended on at91rm9200")

introduced a refcounting regression, because in error case refcounter
must be balanced. Fix it by calling pm_runtime_put_noidle() in error case.

While here, fix the same mistake in other couple of places.
