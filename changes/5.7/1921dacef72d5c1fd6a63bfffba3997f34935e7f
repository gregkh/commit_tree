Input: goodix - make resetting the controller at probe independent from the GPIO setup

Before this commit we would always reset the controller at probe when we
have access to the GPIOs which are necessary to do a reset.

Doing the reset requires access to the GPIOs, but just because we have
access to the GPIOs does not mean that we should always reset the
controller at probe. On X86 ACPI platforms the BIOS / UEFI firmware will
already have reset the controller and it will have loaded the device
specific config into the controller. Doing the reset sometimes causes the
controller to lose its configuration, so on X86 ACPI platforms this is not
a good idea.

This commit adds a new reset_controller_at_probe boolean to control the
reset at probe behavior.

This commits sets the new bool to true when we set irq_pin_access_method
to IRQ_PIN_ACCESS_GPIO, so there are no functional changes.
