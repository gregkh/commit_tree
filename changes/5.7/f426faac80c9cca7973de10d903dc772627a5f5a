crypto: chelsio - remove extra allocation for chtls_dev

chtls_uld_add allocates room for info->nports net_device structs
following the chtls_dev struct, presumably because it was originally
intended that the ports array would be stored there. This is suggested
by the assignment which was present in initial versions and removed by
c4e848586cf1 ("crypto: chelsio - remove redundant assignment to
cdev->ports"):

	cdev->ports = (struct net_device **)(cdev + 1);

This assignment was never used, being overwritten by lldi->ports
immediately afterwards, and I couldn't find any uses of the memory
allocated past the end of the struct.
