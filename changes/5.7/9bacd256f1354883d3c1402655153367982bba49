tcp: cache line align MAX_TCP_HEADER

TCP stack is dumb in how it cooks its output packets.

Depending on MAX_HEADER value, we might chose a bad ending point
for the headers.

If we align the end of TCP headers to cache line boundary, we
make sure to always use the smallest number of cache lines,
which always help.
