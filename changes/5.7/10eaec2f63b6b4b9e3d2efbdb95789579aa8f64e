mm: kmem: cleanup (__)memcg_kmem_charge_memcg() arguments

Patch series "mm: memcg: kmem API cleanup", v2.

This patchset aims to clean up the kernel memory charging API.  It doesn't
bring any functional changes, just removes unused arguments, renames some
functions and fixes some comments.

Currently it's not obvious which functions are most basic
(memcg_kmem_(un)charge_memcg()) and which are based on them
(memcg_kmem_(un)charge()).  The patchset renames these functions and
removes unused arguments:

TL;DR:
was:
  memcg_kmem_charge_memcg(page, gfp, order, memcg)
  memcg_kmem_uncharge_memcg(memcg, nr_pages)
  memcg_kmem_charge(page, gfp, order)
  memcg_kmem_uncharge(page, order)

now:
  memcg_kmem_charge(memcg, gfp, nr_pages)
  memcg_kmem_uncharge(memcg, nr_pages)
  memcg_kmem_charge_page(page, gfp, order)
  memcg_kmem_uncharge_page(page, order)

This patch (of 6):

The first argument of memcg_kmem_charge_memcg() and
__memcg_kmem_charge_memcg() is the page pointer and it's not used.  Let's
drop it.

Memcg pointer is passed as the last argument.  Move it to the first place
for consistency with other memcg functions, e.g.
__memcg_kmem_uncharge_memcg() or try_charge().
