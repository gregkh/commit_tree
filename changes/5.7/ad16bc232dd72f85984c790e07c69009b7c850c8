dmaengine: at_hdmac: Return err in case the chan is not free at alloc res time

Having a list of descriptors allocated for the channel at
device_alloc_chan_resources() time is a sign for bad free usage.
Return err and add a debug message in case the channel is not
free from a previous use.

atchan->descs_allocated becomes useless, get rid of it. More,
drop the error message in atc_desc_get() because now it would
introduce an extra if statement. The callers of atc_desc_get()
already print error messages in case the callee fails, no one
is hurt.
