io-wq: split hashing and enqueueing

It's a preparation patch removing io_wq_enqueue_hashed(), which
now should be done by io_wq_hash_work() + io_wq_enqueue().

Also, set hash value for dependant works, and do it as late as possible,
because req->file can be unavailable before. This hash will be ignored
by io-wq.
