mm, memcg: prevent memory.max load tearing

This one is a bit more nuanced because we have memcg_max_mutex, which is
mostly just used for enforcing invariants, but we still need to READ_ONCE
since (despite its name) it doesn't really protect memory.max access.

On write (page_counter_set_max() and memory_max_write()) we use xchg(),
which uses smp_mb(), so that's already fine.
