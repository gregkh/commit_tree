KVM: s390/mm: Make pages accessible before destroying the guest

Before we destroy the secure configuration, we better make all
pages accessible again. This also happens during reboot, where we reboot
into a non-secure guest that then can go again into secure mode. As
this "new" secure guest will have a new ID we cannot reuse the old page
state.
