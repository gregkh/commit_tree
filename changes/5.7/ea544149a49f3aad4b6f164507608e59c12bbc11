btrfs: move hint_byte into find_free_extent_ctl

This commit moves hint_byte into find_free_extent_ctl, so that we can
modify the hint_byte in the other functions. This will help us split
find_free_extent further. This commit also renames the function argument
"hint_byte" to "hint_byte_orig" to avoid misuse.
