rtc: jz4740: Rename vendor-specific DT properties

These properties are never set anywhere within any of the upstream
devicetree files, so I assume I'm not breaking the ABI with this change.

Rename vendor-specific DT properties to have the 'ingenic,' prefix,
which they should have had from the start.
