kbuild: do not pass $(KBUILD_CFLAGS) to scripts/mkcompile_h

scripts/mkcompile_h uses $(CC) only for getting the version string.

I suspected there was a specific reason why the additional flags were
needed, and dug the commit history. This code dates back to at least
2002 [1], but I could not get any more clue.

Just get rid of it.
