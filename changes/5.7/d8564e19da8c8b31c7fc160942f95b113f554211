s390/qdio: allow for non-contiguous SBAL array in init_data

Upper-layer drivers allocate their SBALs by calling qdio_alloc_buffers()
for each individual queue. But when later passing the SBAL addresses to
qdio_establish(), they need to be in a single array of pointers.
So if the driver uses multiple Input or Output queues, it needs to
allocate a temporary array just to present all its SBAL pointers in this
layout.

This patch slightly changes the format of the QDIO initialization data,
so that drivers can pass a per-queue array where each element points to
a queue's SBAL array.
zfcp doesn't use multiple queues, so the impact there is trivial.
For qeth this brings a nice reduction in complexity, and removes
a page-sized allocation.
