security: Refactor declaration of LSM hooks

The information about the different types of LSM hooks is scattered
in two locations i.e. union security_list_options and
struct security_hook_heads. Rather than duplicating this information
even further for BPF_PROG_TYPE_LSM, define all the hooks with the
LSM_HOOK macro in lsm_hook_defs.h which is then used to generate all
the data structures required by the LSM framework.

The LSM hooks are defined as:

  LSM_HOOK(<return_type>, <default_value>, <hook_name>, args...)

with <default_value> acccessible in security.c as:

  LSM_RET_DEFAULT(<hook_name>)
