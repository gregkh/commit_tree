bus: mhi: core: Offload register accesses to the controller

When reading or writing MHI registers, the core assumes that the physical
link is a memory mapped PCI link.  This assumption may not hold for all
MHI devices.  The controller knows what is the physical link (ie PCI, I2C,
SPI, etc), and therefore knows the proper methods to access that link.
The controller can also handle link specific error scenarios, such as
reading -1 when the PCI link went down.

Therefore, it is appropriate that the MHI core requests the controller to
make register accesses on behalf of the core, which abstracts the core
from link specifics, and end up removing an unnecessary assumption.
