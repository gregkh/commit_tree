console: Don't perform test for CON_BRL flag

We don't call braille_register_console() without CON_BRL flag set.
And the _braille_unregister_console() already tests for console to have
CON_BRL flag. No need to repeat this in braille_unregister_console().

Drop the repetitive checks from Braille console driver.
