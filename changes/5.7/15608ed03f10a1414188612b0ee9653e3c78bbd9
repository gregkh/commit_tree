KVM: x86: Add helpers to perform CPUID-based guest vendor check

Add helpers to provide CPUID-based guest vendor checks, i.e. to do the
ugly register comparisons.  Use the new helpers to check for an AMD
guest vendor in guest_cpuid_is_amd() as well as in the existing emulator
flows.

Using the new helpers fixes a _very_ theoretical bug where
guest_cpuid_is_amd() would get a false positive on a non-AMD virtual CPU
with a vendor string beginning with "Auth" due to the previous logic
only checking EBX.  It also fixes a marginally less theoretically bug
where guest_cpuid_is_amd() would incorrectly return false for a guest
CPU with "AMDisbetter!" as its vendor string.
