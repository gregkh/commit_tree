ASoC: soc-pcm: adjustment for DAI member 0 reset

commit 3635bf09a89cf ("ASoC: soc-pcm: add symmetry for channels and
sample bits") set 0 not only to dai->rate but also to dai->channels and
dai->sample_bits if DAI was not active at soc_pcm_close().

and

commit d3383420c969c ("ASoC: soc-pcm: move DAIs parameters cleaning into
hw_free()") moved it from soc_pcm_close() to soc_pcm_hw_free().

These happen at v3.14.
But, maybe because of branch merge conflict or something similar happen
then, soc_pcm_close() still has old settings
(care only dai->rate, doesn't care dai->channels/sample_bits).
This is 100% duplicated operation.

This patch removes soc_pcm_close() side operation which supposed to
already moved to soc_pcm_hw_free().
