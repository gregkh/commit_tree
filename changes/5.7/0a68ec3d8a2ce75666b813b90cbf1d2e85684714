USB: serial: f81232: set F81534A serial port with RS232 mode

The Fintek F81532A/534A/535/536 is USB-to-2/4/8/12 serial ports device
and the serial ports are default disabled. Each port contains max 3 pins
GPIO and the 3 pins are default pull high with input mode.

When the serial port had activated (running probe()), we'll transform the
3 pins from GPIO function publicly to control Tranceiver privately use.
We'll default set to 0/0/1 for control transceiver to RS232 mode.

Otherwise, If the serial port is not active, the 3 pins is in GPIO mode
and controlled by global GPIO device with VID/PID: 2c42/16f8.
