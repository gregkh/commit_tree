bpf: Add test ops for BPF_PROG_TYPE_TRACING

The current fexit and fentry tests rely on a different program to
exercise the functions they attach to. Instead of doing this, implement
the test operations for tracing which will also be used for
BPF_MODIFY_RETURN in a subsequent patch.

Also, clean up the fexit test to use the generated skeleton.
