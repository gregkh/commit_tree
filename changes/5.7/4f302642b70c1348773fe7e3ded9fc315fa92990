dmaengine: idxd: fix interrupt completion after unmasking

The current implementation may miss completions after we unmask the
interrupt. In order to make sure we process all competions, we need to:
1. Do an MMIO read from the device as a barrier to ensure that all PCI
   writes for completions have arrived.
2. Check for any additional completions that we missed.
