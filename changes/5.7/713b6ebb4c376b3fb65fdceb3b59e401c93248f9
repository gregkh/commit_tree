net: ipa: fix a bug in ipa_endpoint_stop()

In ipa_endpoint_stop(), for TX endpoints we set the number of retries
to 0.  When we break out of the loop, retries being 0 means we return
EIO rather than the value of ret (which should be 0).

Fix this by using a non-zero retry count for both RX and TX
channels, and just break out of the loop after calling
gsi_channel_stop() for TX channels.  This way only RX channels
will retry, and the retry count will be non-zero at the end
for TX channels (so the proper value gets returned).
