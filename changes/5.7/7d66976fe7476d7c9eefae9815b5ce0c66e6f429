i2c: at91: Fix pinmux after devm_gpiod_get() for bus recovery

devm_gpiod_get() usually calls gpio_request_enable() for non-strict pinmux
drivers. These puts the pins in GPIO mode, whithout notifying the pinctrl
driver. At this point, the I2C bus no longer owns the pins. To mux the
pins back to the I2C bus, we use the pinctrl driver to change the state
of the pins to GPIO, before using devm_gpiod_get(). After the pins are
received as GPIOs, we switch theer pinctrl state back to the default
one,
