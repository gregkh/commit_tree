staging: greybus: Fix uninitialized scalar variable

In the "gb_tty_set_termios" function the "newline" variable is declared
but not initialized. So the "flow_control" member is not initialized and
the OR / AND operations with itself results in an undefined value in
this member.

The purpose of the code is to set the flow control type, so remove the
OR / AND self operator and set the value directly.
