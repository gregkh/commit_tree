irqchip/ti-sci-inta: Fix processing of masked irqs

The ti_sci_inta_irq_handler() does not take into account INTA IRQs state
(masked/unmasked) as it uses INTA_STATUS_CLEAR_j register to get INTA IRQs
status, which provides raw status value.
This causes hard IRQ handlers to be called or threaded handlers to be
scheduled many times even if corresponding INTA IRQ is masked.
Above, first of all, affects the LEVEL interrupts processing and causes
unexpected behavior up the system stack or crash.

Fix it by using the Interrupt Masked Status INTA_STATUSM_j register which
provides masked INTA IRQs status.
