mptcp: Use per-subflow storage for DATA_FIN sequence number

Instead of reading the MPTCP-level sequence number when sending DATA_FIN,
store the data in the subflow so it can be safely accessed when the
subflow TCP headers are written to the packet without the MPTCP-level
lock held. This also allows the MPTCP-level socket to close individual
subflows without closing the MPTCP connection.
