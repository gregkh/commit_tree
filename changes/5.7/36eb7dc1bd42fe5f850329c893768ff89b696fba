cpufreq: imx6q: Fixes unwanted cpu overclocking on i.MX6ULL

imx6ul_opp_check_speed_grading is called for both i.MX6UL and i.MX6ULL.
Since the i.MX6ULL was introduced to a separate ocotp compatible node
later, it is possible that the i.MX6ULL has also dtbs with
"fsl,imx6ull-ocotp". On a system without nvmem-cell speed grade a
missing check on this node causes a driver fail without considering
the cpu speed grade.

This patch prevents unwanted cpu overclocking on i.MX6ULL with compatible
node "fsl,imx6ull-ocotp" in old dtbs without nvmem-cell speed grade.
