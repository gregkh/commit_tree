usb: typec: mux: intel: Handle alt mode HPD_HIGH

According to the PMC Type C Subsystem (TCSS) Mux programming guide rev
0.6, when a device is transitioning to DP Alternate Mode state, if the
HPD_STATE (bit 7) field in the status update command VDO is set to
HPD_HIGH, the HPD_HIGH field in the Alternate Mode request “mode_data”
field (bit 14) should also be set. Ensure the bit is correctly handled
while issuing the Alternate Mode request.
