make build_open_flags() treat O_CREAT | O_EXCL as implying O_NOFOLLOW

O_CREAT | O_EXCL means "-EEXIST if we run into a trailing symlink".
As it is, we might or might not have LOOKUP_FOLLOW in op->intent
in that case - that depends upon having O_NOFOLLOW in open flags.
It doesn't matter, since we won't be checking it in that case -
do_last() bails out earlier.

However, making sure it's not set (i.e. acting as if we had an explicit
O_NOFOLLOW) makes the behaviour more explicit and allows to reorder the
check for O_CREAT | O_EXCL in do_last() with the call of step_into()
immediately following it.
