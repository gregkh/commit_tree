media: venus: firmware: Ignore secure call error on first resume

With the latest cleanup in qcom scm driver the secure monitor
call for setting the remote processor state returns EINVAL when
it is called for the first time and after another scm call
auth_and_reset. The error returned from scm call could be ignored
because the state transition is already done in auth_and_reset.
