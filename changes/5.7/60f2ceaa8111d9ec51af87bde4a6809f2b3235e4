posix-cpu-timers: Remove unnecessary locking around cpu_clock_sample_group

As of e78c3496790e ("time, signal: Protect resource use statistics
with seqlock") cpu_clock_sample_group no longers needs siglock
protection.  Unfortunately no one realized it at the time.

Remove the extra locking that is for cpu_clock_sample_group and not
for cpu_clock_sample.  This significantly simplifies the code.
