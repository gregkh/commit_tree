scsi: lpfc: Fix scsi host template for SLI3 vports

SCSI layer sends driver IOs with more s/g segments than driver can handle.
This results in "Too many sg segments from dma_map_sg. Config 64, seg_cnt
219" error messages from the lpfc_scsi_prep_dma_buf_s3() routine.

The was due to use the driver using individual templates for pport and
vport, host reset enabled or not, nvme vs scsi, etc. In the end, there was
a combination for a vport that didn't match the pport.

Rather than enumerating more templates and more discretionary assignments,
revert to a base template that is copied to a template specific to the
pport/vport. Then, based on role, attributes and sli type, modify the
fields that are different for that port.  Added a log message to
lpfc_create_port to validate values.
