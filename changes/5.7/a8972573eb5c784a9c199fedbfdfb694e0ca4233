checkpatch: support "base-commit:" format

In order to support the get-lore-mbox.py tool described in [1], I ran:

    git format-patch --base=<commit> --cover-letter <revrange>

...  which generated a "base-commit: <commit-hash>" tag at the end of the
cover letter.  However, checkpatch.pl generated an error upon encounting
"base-commit:" in the cover letter:

    "ERROR: Please use git commit description style..."

...  because it found the "commit" keyword, and failed to recognize that
it was part of the "base-commit" phrase, and as such, should not be
subjected to the same commit description style rules.

Update checkpatch.pl to include a special case for "base-commit:" (at the
start of the line, possibly with some leading whitespace) so that that tag
no longer generates a checkpatch error.
