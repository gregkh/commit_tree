tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Avoid duplicate Package strings for json

For platforms where multiple packages/die, this makes "Package-" key
duplicate. To make unique, add die and cpu id to key name.

So "Package-0" key name will change to "Package-0-die-x:cpu-x".

For example:
$sudo ./intel-speed-select -f json  perf-profile info
Intel(R) Speed Select Technology
Executing on CPU model:106[0x6a]
{
  "package-0:die-0:cpu-0": {
    "perf-profile-level-0": {
      "cpu-count": "32",
      "enable-cpu-count": "32",
...
...
 "package-1:die-0:cpu-16": {

    "perf-profile-level-0": {
      "cpu-count": "32",
      "enable-cpu-count": "32",
      "enable-cpu-mask": "ffff0000,ffff0000",
...
...

For non json format, there is no change. Here when print_package_info()
is called, it will return the level to print for other information.
This level is used formatting. Also in some function duplicate code
was there to print package,die and CPU information. Replace all that
code with a call to print_package_info().
