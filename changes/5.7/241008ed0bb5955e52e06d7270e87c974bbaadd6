mtd: rawnand: ams-delta: Push inversion handling to gpiolib

Let platforms take care of declaring correct GPIO pin polarity so we
can just ask a GPIO line to be asserted or deasserted and gpiolib deals
with the rest depending on how the platform is configured.

Inspired by similar changes to regulator drivers by Linus Walleij
