x86, sched: Add support for frequency invariance on XEON_PHI_KNL/KNM

The scheduler needs the ratio freq_curr/freq_max for frequency-invariant
accounting. On Xeon Phi CPUs set freq_max to the second-highest frequency
reported by the CPU.

Xeon Phi CPUs such as Knights Landing and Knights Mill typically have either
one or two turbo frequencies; in the former case that's 100 MHz above the base
frequency, in the latter case the two levels are 100 MHz and 200 MHz above
base frequency.

We set freq_max to the second-highest frequency reported by the CPU. This
could be the base frequency (if only one turbo level is available) or the first
turbo level (if two levels are available). The rationale is to compromise
between power efficiency or performance -- going straight to max turbo would
favor efficiency and blindly using base freq would favor performance.

For reference, this is how MSR_TURBO_RATIO_LIMIT must be parsed on a Xeon Phi
to get the available frequencies (taken from a comment in turbostat's sources):

    [0] -- Reserved
    [7:1] -- Base value of number of active cores of bucket 1.
    [15:8] -- Base value of freq ratio of bucket 1.
    [20:16] -- +ve delta of number of active cores of bucket 2.
    i.e. active cores of bucket 2 =
    active cores of bucket 1 + delta
    [23:21] -- Negative delta of freq ratio of bucket 2.
    i.e. freq ratio of bucket 2 =
    freq ratio of bucket 1 - delta
    [28:24]-- +ve delta of number of active cores of bucket 3.
    [31:29]-- -ve delta of freq ratio of bucket 3.
    [36:32]-- +ve delta of number of active cores of bucket 4.
    [39:37]-- -ve delta of freq ratio of bucket 4.
    [44:40]-- +ve delta of number of active cores of bucket 5.
    [47:45]-- -ve delta of freq ratio of bucket 5.
    [52:48]-- +ve delta of number of active cores of bucket 6.
    [55:53]-- -ve delta of freq ratio of bucket 6.
    [60:56]-- +ve delta of number of active cores of bucket 7.
    [63:61]-- -ve delta of freq ratio of bucket 7.

1. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION: TBENCH +5%
-------------------------------------

A performance evaluation was conducted on a Knights Mill machine (see "Test
Setup" below), were the frequency-invariance patch (on schedutil) is compared
to both non-invariant schedutil and active intel_pstate with powersave: all
three tested kernels behave the same performance-wise and with regard to power
consumption (performance per watt). The only notable difference is tbench:

comparison ratio of performance with baseline; 1.00 means neutral,
higher is better:

                      I_PSTATE      FREQ-INV
    ----------------------------------------
    tbench                1.04          1.05

performance-per-watt ratios with baseline; 1.00 means neutral, higher is better:

                      I_PSTATE      FREQ-INV
    ----------------------------------------
    tbench                1.03          1.04

which essentially means that frequency-invariant schedutil is 5% better than
baseline, the same as intel_pstate+powersave.

As the results above are averaged over the varying parameter, here the detailed
table.
