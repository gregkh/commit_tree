x86/mm: Remove the now redundant N_MEMORY check

In commit

  f70029bbaacb ("mm, memory_hotplug: drop CONFIG_MOVABLE_NODE")

the dependency on CONFIG_MOVABLE_NODE was removed for N_MEMORY.
Before, CONFIG_HIGHMEM && !CONFIG_MOVABLE_NODE could make (N_MEMORY ==
N_NORMAL_MEMORY) be true.

After that commit, N_MEMORY cannot be equal to N_NORMAL_MEMORY. So the
conditional check in paging_init() is not needed anymore, remove it.
