Btrfs: don't iterate mod seq list when putting a tree mod seq

Each new element added to the mod seq list is always appended to the list,
and each one gets a sequence number coming from a counter which gets
incremented everytime a new element is added to the list (or a new node
is added to the tree mod log rbtree). Therefore the element with the
lowest sequence number is always the first element in the list.

So just remove the list iteration at btrfs_put_tree_mod_seq() that
computes the minimum sequence number in the list and replace it with
a check for the first element's sequence number.
