arm64: dts: rockchip: fix inverted headphone detection on Pinebook Pro

On the Pinebook Pro the headphone jack is dual use. It can be used either
as a normal headphone jack or as a debug serial connection. This
functionality is controlled via a small hardware switch on the mainboard.
Unfortunately flipping this switch biases the headphone detection switch
inside the headphone jack at 3.3 V if in `debug UART` position but
to GND when in `headphone out` position.
This results in an inversion of the headphone detection logic depending
on the switch position.
Since the headphone jack can only be used for audio when in
`headphone out` position this commit changes the headphone detect GPIO
logic to be correct for that case rather than for the debug UART.
