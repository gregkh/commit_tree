ASoC: soc-pcm: merge playback/cature_active into stream_active

DAI has playback_active and capture_active to care usage count.
OTOH, we have SNDRV_PCM_STREAM_PLAYBACK/CAPTURE.
But because of this kind of implementation mismatch,
ALSA SoC has many verbose code.

To solve this issue, this patch merge playback_active/capture_active
into stream_active[2];
