ice: Fix Port VLAN priority bits

Currently when configuring a port VLAN for a VF we are only shifting the
QoS bits by 12. This is incorrect. Fix this by getting rid of the ICE
specific VLAN defines and use the kernel VLAN defines instead.

Also, don't assign a value to vlanprio until the VLAN ID and QoS
parameters have been validated.

Also, there are many places we do (le16_to_cpu(vsi->info.pvid) &
VLAN_VID_MASK). Instead do (vf->port_vlan_info & VLAN_VID_MASK) because
we always save what's stored in vsi->info.pvid to vf->port_vlan_info in
the CPU's endianness.
