usb: phy: twl6030-usb: Fix a resource leak in an error handling path in 'twl6030_usb_probe()'

A call to 'regulator_get()' is hidden in 'twl6030_usb_ldo_init()'. A
corresponding put must be performed in the error handling path, as
already done in the remove function.

While at it, also move a 'free_irq()' call in the error handling path in
order to be consistent.
