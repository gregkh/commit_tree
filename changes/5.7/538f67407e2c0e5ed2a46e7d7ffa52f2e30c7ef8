HID: i2c-hid: reset Synaptics SYNA2393 on resume

On the Dell XPS 9570, the Synaptics SYNA2393 touchpad generates spurious
interrupts after resuming from suspend until it receives some input or
is reset. Add it to the quirk I2C_HID_QUIRK_RESET_ON_RESUME so that it
is reset when resuming from suspend.
