gfs2: Return bool from gfs2_assert functions

The gfs2_assert functions only print messages when the filesystem hasn't been
withdrawn yet, and they indicate whether or not they've printed something in
their return value.  However, none of the callers use that information, so
simply return whether or not the assert has failed.

(The gfs2_assert functions are still backwards; they return false when an
assertion is true.)
