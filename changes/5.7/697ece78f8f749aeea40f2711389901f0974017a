powerpc/32s: reorder Linux PTE bits to better match Hash PTE bits.

Reorder Linux PTE bits to (almost) match Hash PTE bits.

RW Kernel : PP = 00
RO Kernel : PP = 00
RW User   : PP = 01
RO User   : PP = 11

So naturally, we should have
_PAGE_USER = 0x001
_PAGE_RW   = 0x002

Today 0x001 and 0x002 and _PAGE_PRESENT and _PAGE_HASHPTE which
both are software only bits.

Switch _PAGE_USER and _PAGE_PRESET
Switch _PAGE_RW and _PAGE_HASHPTE

This allows to remove a few insns.
