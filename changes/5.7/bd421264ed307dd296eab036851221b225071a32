iommu: Fix deferred domain attachment

The IOMMU core code has support for deferring the attachment of a domain
to a device. This is needed in kdump kernels where the new domain must
not be attached to a device before the device driver takes it over.

When the AMD IOMMU driver got converted to use the dma-iommu
implementation, the deferred attaching got lost. The code in
dma-iommu.c has support for deferred attaching, but it calls into
iommu_attach_device() to actually do it. But iommu_attach_device()
will check if the device should be deferred in it code-path and do
nothing, breaking deferred attachment.

Move the is_deferred_attach() check out of the attach_device path and
into iommu_group_add_device() to make deferred attaching work from the
dma-iommu code.
