drivers: soc: xilinx: fix firmware driver Kconfig dependency

The firmware driver is optional, but the power driver depends on it,
which needs to be reflected in Kconfig to avoid link errors:

aarch64-linux-ld: drivers/soc/xilinx/zynqmp_power.o: in function `zynqmp_pm_isr':
zynqmp_power.c:(.text+0x284): undefined reference to `zynqmp_pm_invoke_fn'

The firmware driver can probably be allowed for compile-testing as
well, so it's best to drop the dependency on the ZYNQ platform
here and allow building as long as the firmware code is built-in.
