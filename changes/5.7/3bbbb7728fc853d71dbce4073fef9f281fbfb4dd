ASoC: dapm: connect virtual mux with default value

Since a virtual mixer has no backing registers
to decide which path to connect,
it will try to match with initial state.
This is to ensure that the default mixer choice will be
correctly powered up during initialization.
Invert flag is used to select initial state of the virtual switch.
Since actual hardware can't be disconnected by virtual switch,
connected is better choice as initial state in many cases.
