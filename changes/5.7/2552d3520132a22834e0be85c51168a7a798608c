PM: QoS: Rename things related to the CPU latency QoS

First, rename PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LAT_DEFAULT_VALUE to
PM_QOS_CPU_LATENCY_DEFAULT_VALUE and update all of the code
referring to it accordingly.

Next, rename cpu_dma_constraints to cpu_latency_constraints, move
the definition of it closer to the functions referring to it and
update all of them accordingly.  [While at it, add a comment to mark
the start of the code related to the CPU latency QoS.]

Finally, rename the pm_qos_power_*() family of functions and
pm_qos_power_fops to cpu_latency_qos_*() and cpu_latency_qos_fops,
respectively, and update the definition of cpu_latency_qos_miscdev.
[While at it, update the miscdev interface code start comment.]

No intentional functional impact.
