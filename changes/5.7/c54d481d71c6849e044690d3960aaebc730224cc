apparmor: Fix use-after-free in aa_audit_rule_init

In the implementation of aa_audit_rule_init(), when aa_label_parse()
fails the allocated memory for rule is released using
aa_audit_rule_free(). But after this release, the return statement
tries to access the label field of the rule which results in
use-after-free. Before releasing the rule, copy errNo and return it
after release.
