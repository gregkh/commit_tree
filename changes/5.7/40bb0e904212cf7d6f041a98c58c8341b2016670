Revert "powerpc/32s: reorder Linux PTE bits to better match Hash PTE bits."

This reverts commit 697ece78f8f749aeea40f2711389901f0974017a.

The implementation of SWAP on powerpc requires page protection
bits to not be one of the least significant PTE bits.

Until the SWAP implementation is changed and this requirement voids,
we have to keep at least _PAGE_RW outside of the 3 last bits.

For now, revert to previous PTE bits order. A further rework
may come later.
