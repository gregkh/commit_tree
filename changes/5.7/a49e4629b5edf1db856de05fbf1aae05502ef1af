cpuset: Make cpuset hotplug synchronous

Convert cpuset_hotplug_workfn() into synchronous call for cpu hotplug
path. For memory hotplug path it still gets queued as a work item.

Since cpuset_hotplug_workfn() can be made synchronous for cpu hotplug
path, it is not required to wait for cpuset hotplug while thawing
processes.
