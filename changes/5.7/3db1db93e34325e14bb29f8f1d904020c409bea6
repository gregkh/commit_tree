s390/qdio: cleanly split alloc and establish

All that qdio_allocate() actually uses from the init_data is the cdev,
and the number of Input and Output Queues. Have the driver pass those as
parameters, and defer the init_data processing into qdio_establish().
This includes writing per-device(!) trace entries, and most of the
sanity checks.
