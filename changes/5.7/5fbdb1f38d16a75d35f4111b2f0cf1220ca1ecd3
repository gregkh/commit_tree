drm/amd/display: Don't take the address of skip_scdc_overwrite in dc_link_detect_helper

Clang warns:

../drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/core/dc_link.c:980:36:
warning: address of 'sink->edid_caps.panel_patch.skip_scdc_overwrite'
will always evaluate to 'true' [-Wpointer-bool-conversion]
                if (&sink->edid_caps.panel_patch.skip_scdc_overwrite)
                ~~   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 warning generated.

This is probably not what was intended so remove the address of
operator, which matches how skip_scdc_overwrite is handled in the rest
of the driver.

While we're here, drop an extra newline after this if block.
