platform/x86: touchscreen_dmi: Add EFI embedded firmware info support

Sofar we have been unable to get permission from the vendors to put the
firmware for touchscreens listed in touchscreen_dmi in linux-firmware.

Some of the tablets with such a touchscreen have a touchscreen driver, and
thus a copy of the firmware, as part of their EFI code.

This commit adds the necessary info for the new EFI embedded-firmware code
to extract these firmwares, making the touchscreen work OOTB without the
user needing to manually add the firmware.
