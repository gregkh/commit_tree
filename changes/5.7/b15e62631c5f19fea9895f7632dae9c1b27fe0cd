net sched: fix reporting the first-time use timestamp

When a new action is installed, firstuse field of 'tcf_t' is explicitly set
to 0. Value of zero means "new action, not yet used"; as a packet hits the
action, 'firstuse' is stamped with the current jiffies value.

tcf_tm_dump() should return 0 for firstuse if action has not yet been hit.
