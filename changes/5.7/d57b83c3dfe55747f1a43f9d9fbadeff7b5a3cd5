habanalabs: modify the return values of hl_read/write routines

The hl read and write routines implement the hwmon_ops read and write
interface routines respectively.
These routines are expected to return a completion status when called,
which was not the case until this commit.
This commit modifies these routines to return 0 upon success and a
negative error value upon failure.
