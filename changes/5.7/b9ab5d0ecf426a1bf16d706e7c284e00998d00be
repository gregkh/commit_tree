net/mlx5e: Add context to the preactivate hook

Sometimes the preactivate hook of mlx5e_safe_switch_channels needs more
parameters than just struct mlx5e_priv *. For such cases, a new
parameter (void *context) is added to preactivate hooks.

Some of the existing normal functions are currently used as preactivate
callbacks. To avoid adding an extra unused parameter, they are wrapped
in an automatic way using the MLX5E_DEFINE_PREACTIVATE_WRAPPER_CTX
macro.
