svcrdma: Refactor chunk list encoders

Same idea as the receive-side changes I did a while back: use
xdr_stream helpers rather than open-coding the XDR chunk list
encoders. This builds the Reply transport header from beginning to
end without backtracking.

As additional clean-ups, fill in documenting comments for the XDR
encoders and sprinkle some trace points in the new encoding
functions.
