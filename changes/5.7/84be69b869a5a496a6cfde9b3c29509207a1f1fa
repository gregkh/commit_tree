nexthop: Fix attribute checking for groups

For nexthop groups, attributes after NHA_GROUP_TYPE are invalid, but
nh_check_attr_group starts checking at NHA_GROUP. The group type defaults
to multipath and the NHA_GROUP_TYPE is currently optional so this has
slipped through so far. Fix the attribute checking to handle support of
new group types.
