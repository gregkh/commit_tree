s390/mm: remove page table downgrade support

This update consolidates page table handling code. Because
there are hardly any 31-bit binaries left we do not need to
optimize for that.

No extra efforts are needed to ensure that a compat task does
not map anything above 2GB. The TASK_SIZE limit for 31-bit
tasks is 2GB already and the generic code does check that a
resulting map address would not surpass that limit.
