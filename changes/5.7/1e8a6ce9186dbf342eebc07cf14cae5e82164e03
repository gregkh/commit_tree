drm/bridge: anx6345: set correct BPC for display_info of connector

Some drivers (e.g. sun4i-drm) need this info to decide whether they
need to enable dithering. Currently driver reports what panel supports
and if panel supports 8 we don't get dithering enabled.

Hardcode BPC to 6 for now since that's the only BPC
that driver supports.
