Input: mms114 - fix handling of mms345l

MMS345L is another first generation touch screen from Melfas,
which uses the same registers as MMS152.

However, using I2C_M_NOSTART for it causes errors when reading:

	i2c i2c-0: sendbytes: NAK bailout.
	mms114 0-0048: __mms114_read_reg: i2c transfer failed (-5)

The driver works fine as soon as I2C_M_NOSTART is removed.

[dtor: removed separate mms345l handling, made everyone use standard
transfer mode, propagated the 10bit addressing flag to the read part of the
transfer as well.]
