selftests/ftrace: Check required filter files before running test

Without CONFIG_DYNAMIC_FTRACE, some tests get failure because required
filter files(set_ftrace_filter/available_filter_functions/stack_trace_filter)
are missing.  So implement check_filter_file() and make all related tests
check required filter files by it.

BTW: set_ftrace_filter and available_filter_functions are introduced together
so just check either of them.
