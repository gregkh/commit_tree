genirq: Provide interrupt injection mechanism

Error injection mechanisms need a half ways safe way to inject interrupts as
invoking generic_handle_irq() or the actual device interrupt handler
directly from e.g. a debugfs write is not guaranteed to be safe.

On x86 generic_handle_irq() is unsafe due to the hardware trainwreck which
is the base of x86 interrupt delivery and affinity management.

Move the irq debugfs injection code into a separate function which can be
used by error injection code as well.

The implementation prevents at least that state is corrupted, but it cannot
close a very tiny race window on x86 which might result in a stale and not
serviced device interrupt under very unlikely circumstances.

This is explicitly for debugging and testing and not for production use or
abuse in random driver code.
