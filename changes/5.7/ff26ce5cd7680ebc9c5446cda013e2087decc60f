libbpf: Add support for dynamic program attach target

Currently when you want to attach a trace program to a bpf program
the section name needs to match the tracepoint/function semantics.

However the addition of the bpf_program__set_attach_target() API
allows you to specify the tracepoint/function dynamically.

The call flow would look something like this:

  xdp_fd = bpf_prog_get_fd_by_id(id);
  trace_obj = bpf_object__open_file("func.o", NULL);
  prog = bpf_object__find_program_by_title(trace_obj,
                                           "fentry/myfunc");
  bpf_program__set_expected_attach_type(prog, BPF_TRACE_FENTRY);
  bpf_program__set_attach_target(prog, xdp_fd,
                                 "xdpfilt_blk_all");
  bpf_object__load(trace_obj)
