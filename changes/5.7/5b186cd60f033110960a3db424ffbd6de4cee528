nfp: flower: fix used time of merge flow statistics

Prior to this change the correct value for the used counter is calculated
but not stored nor, therefore, propagated to user-space. In use-cases such
as OVS use-case at least this results in active flows being removed from
the hardware datapath. Which results in both unnecessary flow tear-down
and setup, and packet processing on the host.

This patch addresses the problem by saving the calculated used value
which allows the value to propagate to user-space.

Found by inspection.
