KVM: nVMX: Rename EPTP validity helper and associated variables

Rename valid_ept_address() to nested_vmx_check_eptp() to follow the nVMX
nomenclature and to reflect that the function now checks a lot more than
just the address contained in the EPTP.  Rename address to new_eptp in
associated code.

No functional change intended.
