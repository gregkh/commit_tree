btrfs: Mark pinned log extents as excluded

In preparation to making pinned extents per-transaction ensure that log
such extents are always excluded from caching. To achieve this in
addition to marking them via btrfs_pin_extent_for_log_replay they also
need to be marked with btrfs_add_excluded_extent to prevent log tree
extent buffer being loaded by the free space caching thread. That's
required since log tree blocks are not recorded in the extent tree, hence
they always look free.
