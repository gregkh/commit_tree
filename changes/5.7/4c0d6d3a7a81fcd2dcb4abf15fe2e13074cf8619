net: phylink: add separate pcs operations structure

Add a separate set of PCS operations, which MAC drivers can use to
couple phylink with their associated MAC PCS layer.  The PCS
operations include:

- pcs_get_state() - reads the link up/down, resolved speed, duplex
   and pause from the PCS.
- pcs_config() - configures the PCS for the specified mode, PHY
   interface type, and setting the advertisement.
- pcs_an_restart() - restarts 802.3 in-band negotiation with the
   link partner
- pcs_link_up() - informs the PCS that link has come up, and the
   parameters of the link. Link parameters are used to program the
   PCS for fixed speed and non-inband modes.
