KVM: Drop "const" attribute from old memslot in commit_memory_region()

Drop the "const" attribute from @old in kvm_arch_commit_memory_region()
to allow arch specific code to free arch specific resources in the old
memslot without having to cast away the attribute.  Freeing resources in
kvm_arch_commit_memory_region() paves the way for simplifying
kvm_free_memslot() by eliminating the last usage of its @dont param.
