mvneta: add XDP ethtool errors stats for TX to driver

Adding ethtool stats for when XDP transmitted packets overrun the TX
queue. This is recorded separately for XDP_TX and ndo_xdp_xmit. This
is an important aid for troubleshooting XDP based setups.

It is currently a known weakness and property of XDP that there isn't
any push-back or congestion feedback when transmitting frames via XDP.
It's easy to realise when redirecting from a higher speed link into a
slower speed link, or simply two ingress links into a single egress.
The situation can also happen when Ethernet flow control is active.

For testing the patch and provoking the situation to occur on my
Espressobin board, I configured the TX-queue to be smaller (434) than
RX-queue (512) and overload network with large MTU size frames (as a
larger frame takes longer to transmit).

Hopefully the upcoming XDP TX hook can be extended to provide insight
into these TX queue overflows, to allow programmable adaptation
strategies.
