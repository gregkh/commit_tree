mm/memory.c: clarify a confusing comment for vm_iomap_memory

The param "start" actually referes to the physical memory start, which is
to be mapped into virtual area vma.  And it is the field vma->vm_start
which stands for the start of the area.

Most of the time, we do not read through whole implementation of a
function but only the definition and essential comments.  Accurate
comments are definitely the base stone.
