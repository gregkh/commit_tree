um: virtio: Implement VHOST_USER_PROTOCOL_F_INBAND_NOTIFICATIONS

Implement in-band notifications that are necessary for running
vhost-user devices under externally synchronized time-travel
mode (which is in a follow-up patch). This feature makes what
usually should be eventfd notifications in-band messages.

We'll prefer this feature, under the assumption that only a
few (simulation) devices will ever support it, since it's not
very efficient.
