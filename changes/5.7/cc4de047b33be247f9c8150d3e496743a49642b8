net: tcp: fix rx timestamp behavior for tcp_recvmsg

The stated intent of the original commit is to is to "return the timestamp
corresponding to the highest sequence number data returned." The current
implementation returns the timestamp for the last byte of the last fully
read skb, which is not necessarily the last byte in the recv buffer. This
patch converts behavior to the original definition, and to the behavior of
the previous draft versions of commit 98aaa913b4ed ("tcp: Extend
SOF_TIMESTAMPING_RX_SOFTWARE to TCP recvmsg") which also match this
behavior.
