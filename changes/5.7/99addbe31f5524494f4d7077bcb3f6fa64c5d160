net: broadcom: Select BROADCOM_PHY for BCMGENET

The GENET controller on the Raspberry Pi 4 (2711) is typically
interfaced with an external Broadcom PHY via a RGMII electrical
interface. To make sure that delays are properly configured at the PHY
side, ensure that we the dedicated Broadcom PHY driver
(CONFIG_BROADCOM_PHY) is enabled for this to happen.
