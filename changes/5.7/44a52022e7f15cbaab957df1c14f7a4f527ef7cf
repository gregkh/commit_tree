ext2: fix empty body warnings when -Wextra is used

When EXT2_ATTR_DEBUG is not defined, modify the 2 debug macros
to use the no_printk() macro instead of <nothing>.
This fixes gcc warnings when -Wextra is used:

../fs/ext2/xattr.c:252:42: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
../fs/ext2/xattr.c:258:42: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
../fs/ext2/xattr.c:330:42: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
../fs/ext2/xattr.c:872:45: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘else’ statement [-Wempty-body]

I have verified that the only object code change (with gcc 7.5.0) is
the reversal of some instructions from 'cmp a,b' to 'cmp b,a'.
