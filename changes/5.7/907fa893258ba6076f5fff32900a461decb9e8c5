exfat: add the dummy mount options to be backward compatible with staging/exfat

As Ubuntu and Fedora release new version used kernel version equal to or
higher than v5.4, They started to support kernel exfat filesystem.

Linus reported a mount error with new version of exfat on Fedora:

        exfat: Unknown parameter 'namecase'

This is because there is a difference in mount option between old
staging/exfat and new exfat.  And utf8, debug, and codepage options as
well as namecase have been removed from new exfat.

This patch add the dummy mount options as deprecated option to be
backward compatible with old one.
