tty: xilinx_uartps: Fix missing id assignment to the console

When serial console has been assigned to ttyPS1 (which is serial1 alias)
console index is not updated property and pointing to index -1 (statically
initialized) which ends up in situation where nothing has been printed on
the port.

The commit 18cc7ac8a28e ("Revert "serial: uartps: Register own uart console
and driver structures"") didn't contain this line which was removed by
accident.
