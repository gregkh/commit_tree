ALSA: usb-audio: Check mapping at creating connector controls, too

Add the mapping check to build_connector_control() so that the device
specific quirk can provide the node to skip for the badly behaving
connector controls.  As an example, ALC1220-VB-based codec implements
the skip entry for the broken SPDIF connector detection.
