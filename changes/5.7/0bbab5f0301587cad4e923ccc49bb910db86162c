cfg80211: fix debugfs rename crash

Removing the "if (IS_ERR(dir)) dir = NULL;" check only works
if we adjust the remaining code to not rely on it being NULL.
Check IS_ERR_OR_NULL() before attempting to dereference it.

I'm not actually entirely sure this fixes the syzbot crash as
the kernel config indicates that they do have DEBUG_FS in the
kernel, but this is what I found when looking there.
