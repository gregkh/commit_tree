drm/i915: remove always-defined CONFIG_AS_MOVNTDQA

CONFIG_AS_MOVNTDQA was introduced by commit 0b1de5d58e19 ("drm/i915:
Use SSE4.1 movntdqa to accelerate reads from WC memory").

We raise the minimal supported binutils version from time to time.
The last bump was commit 1fb12b35e5ff ("kbuild: Raise the minimum
required binutils version to 2.21").

I confirmed the code in $(call as-instr,...) can be assembled by the
binutils 2.21 assembler and also by LLVM integrated assembler.

Remove CONFIG_AS_MOVNTDQA, which is always defined.
