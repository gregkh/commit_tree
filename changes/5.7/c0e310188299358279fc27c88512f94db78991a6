drm/i915: Skip barriers inside waits

Attaching to the i915_active barrier is a two stage process, and a flush
is only effective when the barrier is activation. Thus it is possible
for us to see a barrier, and attempt to flush, only for our flush to
have no effect. As such, before attempting to activate signaling on the
fence we need to double check it is a fence!
