IB/rdmavt: Always return ERR_PTR from rvt_create_mmap_info()

The commit below modified rvt_create_mmap_info() to return ERR_PTR's but
didn't update the callers to handle them. Modify rvt_create_mmap_info() to
only return ERR_PTR and fix all error checking after
rvt_create_mmap_info() was called.

Fixes: ff23dfa13457 ("IB: Pass only ib_udata in function prototypes")
