dmaengine: dmatest: Fix process hang when reading 'wait' parameter

If we do

  % echo 1 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/run
  [  115.851124] dmatest: Could not start test, no channels configured

  % echo dma8chan7 > /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/channel
  [  127.563872] dmatest: Added 1 threads using dma8chan7

  % cat /sys/module/dmatest/parameters/wait
  ... !!! HANG !!! ...

The culprit is the commit 6138f967bccc

  ("dmaengine: dmatest: Use fixed point div to calculate iops")

which makes threads not to run, but pending and being kicked off by writing
to the 'run' node. However, it forgot to consider 'wait' routine to avoid
above mentioned case.

In order to fix this, check for really running threads, i.e. with pending
and done flags unset.

It's pity the culprit commit hadn't updated documentation and tested all
possible scenarios.
