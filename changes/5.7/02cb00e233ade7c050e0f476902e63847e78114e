nvmet: Add get_mdts op for controllers

Some transports, such as RDMA, would like to set the Maximum Data
Transfer Size (MDTS) according to device/port/ctrl characteristics.
This will enable the transport to set the optimal MDTS according to
controller needs and device capabilities. Add a new nvmet transport
op that is called during ctrl identification. This will not effect
transports that don't implement this option. The return value of the new
op is according to the NVMe spec definition for MDTS.
