f2fs: fix to account compressed blocks in f2fs_compressed_blocks()

por_fsstress reports inconsistent status in orphan inode, the root cause
of this is in f2fs_write_raw_pages() we decrease i_compr_blocks incorrectly
due to wrong calculation in f2fs_compressed_blocks().

So this patch exposes below two functions based on __f2fs_cluster_blocks:
- f2fs_compressed_blocks: get count of compressed blocks in compressed cluster
- f2fs_cluster_blocks: get count of valid blocks (including reserved blocks)
in compressed cluster.

Then use f2fs_compress_blocks() to get correct compressed blocks count in
f2fs_write_raw_pages().

sanity_check_inode: inode (ino=ad80) hash inconsistent i_compr_blocks:2, i_blocks:1, run fsck to fix
