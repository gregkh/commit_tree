PCI: hv: Move retarget related structures into tlfs header

Currently, retarget_msi_interrupt and other structures it relys on are
defined in pci-hyperv.c. However, those structures are actually defined
in Hypervisor Top-Level Functional Specification [1] and may be
different in sizes of fields or layout from architecture to
architecture. Let's move those definitions into x86's tlfs header file
to support virtual PCI on non-x86 architectures in the future. Note that
"__packed" attribute is added to these structures during the movement
for the same reason as we use the attribute for other TLFS structures in
the header file: make sure the structures meet the specification and
avoid anything unexpected from the compilers.

Additionally, rename struct retarget_msi_interrupt to
hv_retarget_msi_interrupt for the consistent naming convention, also
mirroring the name in TLFS.
