RISC-V: Introduce a new config for SBI v0.1

We now have SBI v0.2 which is more scalable and extendable to handle
future needs for RISC-V supervisor interfaces.

Introduce a new config and move all SBI v0.1 code under that config.
This allows to implement the new replacement SBI extensions cleanly
and remove v0.1 extensions easily in future. Currently, the config
is enabled by default. Once all M-mode software, with v0.1, is no
longer in use, this config option and all relevant code can be easily
removed.
