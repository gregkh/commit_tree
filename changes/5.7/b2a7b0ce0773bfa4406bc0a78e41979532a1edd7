drm/amd/display: Use cursor locking to prevent flip delays

[Why]
Current locking scheme for cursor can result in a flip missing
its vsync, deferring it for one or more vsyncs.  Result is a
potential for stuttering when cursor is moved.

[How]
Use cursor update lock so that flips are not blocked while cursor
is being programmed.
