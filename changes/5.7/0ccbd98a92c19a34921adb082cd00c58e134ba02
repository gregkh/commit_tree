arm64: entry: Annotate vector table and handlers as code

In an effort to clarify and simplify the annotation of assembly
functions new macros have been introduced. These replace ENTRY and
ENDPROC with two different annotations for normal functions and those
with unusual calling conventions. The vector table and handlers aren't
normal C style code so should be annotated as CODE.
