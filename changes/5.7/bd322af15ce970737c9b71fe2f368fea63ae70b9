ata: make SATA_PMP option selectable only if any SATA host driver is enabled

There is no reason to expose SATA_PMP config option when no SATA
host drivers are enabled. To fix it add SATA_HOST config option,
make all SATA host drivers select it and finally make SATA_PMP
config options depend on it.

This also serves as preparation for the future changes which
optimize libata core code size on PATA only setups.
