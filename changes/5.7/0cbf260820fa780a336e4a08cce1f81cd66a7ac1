bus: mhi: core: Add support for registering MHI controllers

This commit adds support for registering MHI controller drivers with
the MHI stack. MHI controller drivers manages the interaction with the
MHI client devices such as the external modems and WiFi chipsets. They
are also the MHI bus master in charge of managing the physical link
between the host and client device.
