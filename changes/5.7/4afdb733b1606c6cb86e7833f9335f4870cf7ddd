fixed file set unregister and update").

It is down to the order that we wait for work done before flushing it
while nobody is likely going to wake us up.

We can drop that completion on stack as flushing work itself is a sync
operation we need and no more is left behind it.

To that end, io_file_put::done is re-used for indicating if it can be
freed in the workqueue worker context.
