arm64: dts: ls1028a: delete extraneous #interrupt-cells for ENETC RCIE

This specifier overrides the interrupt specifier with 3 cells from gic
(/interrupt-controller@6000000), but in fact ENETC is not an interrupt
controller, so the property is bogus.

Interrupts used by the children of the ENETC RCIE must use the full
3-cell specifier required by the GIC.

The issue has no functional consequence so there is no real reason to
port the patch to stable trees.
