Input: goodix - fix spurious key release events

The goodix panel sends spurious interrupts after a 'finger up' event,
which always cause a timeout.
We were exiting the interrupt handler by reporting touch_num == 0, but
this was still processed as valid and caused the code to use the
uninitialised point_data, creating spurious key release events.

Report an error from the interrupt handler so as to avoid processing
invalid point_data further.
