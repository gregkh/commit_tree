iwlwifi: convert the 9260-1x1 device to use the new parameters

The 9260-1x1 device can be differentiated using the PCI device ID.
There is a single occurrence of this device, so continue relying on
the device and subsystem device IDs.

The name of this device was incorrect, so add a new string
specifically for it.
