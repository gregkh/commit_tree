drm/edid: Fix off-by-one in DispID DTD pixel clock

The DispID DTD pixel clock is documented as:
"00 00 00 h → FF FF FF h | Pixel clock ÷ 10,000 0.01 → 167,772.16 Mega Pixels per Sec"
Which seems to imply that we to add one to the raw value.

Reality seems to agree as there are tiled displays in the wild
which currently show a 10kHz difference in the pixel clock
between the tiles (one tile gets its mode from the base EDID,
the other from the DispID block).
