net/mlx5: Avoid processing commands before cmdif is ready

When driver is reloading during recovery flow, it can't get new commands
till command interface is up again. Otherwise we may get to null pointer
trying to access non initialized command structures.

Add cmdif state to avoid processing commands while cmdif is not ready.
