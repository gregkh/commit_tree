drm/amd/display: Fix wrongly passed static prefix

Currently, gcc spews a warning as:
  drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/dc/dcn10/dcn10_hubbub.c: In function ‘hubbub1_verify_allow_pstate_change_high’:
  ./include/drm/drm_print.h:316:2: warning: ‘debug_data’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]

This is because the code checks against a static value although it's
basically a constant and guaranteed to be set.

This patch changes the type prefix from static to const for addressing
the compile warning above and also for letting the compiler optimize
better.
