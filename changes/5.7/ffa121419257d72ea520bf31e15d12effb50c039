drm/amd/display: Set clock optimization required after update clocks

[WHY]
We see an issue that caused clk_optimized_required to be set true in
certain cases, causing passive flips to fail. This is because of a typo
where wm_optimized_required was set twice.

[HOW]
Set clk_optimized_required to false after updating clocks.
