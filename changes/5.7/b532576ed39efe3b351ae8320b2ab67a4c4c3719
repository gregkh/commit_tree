io_uring: don't add non-IO requests to iopoll pending list

We normally disable any commands that aren't specifically poll commands
for a ring that is setup for polling, but we do allow buffer provide and
remove commands to support buffer selection for polled IO. Once a
request is issued, we add it to the poll list to poll for completion. But
we should not do that for non-IO commands, as those request complete
inline immediately and aren't pollable. If we do, we can leave requests
on the iopoll list after they are freed.
