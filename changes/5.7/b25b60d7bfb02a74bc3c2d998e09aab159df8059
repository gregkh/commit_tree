SUNRPC: Fix a potential buffer overflow in 'svc_print_xprts()'

'maxlen' is the total size of the destination buffer. There is only one
caller and this value is 256.

When we compute the size already used and what we would like to add in
the buffer, the trailling NULL character is not taken into account.
However, this trailling character will be added by the 'strcat' once we
have checked that we have enough place.

So, there is a off-by-one issue and 1 byte of the stack could be
erroneously overwridden.

Take into account the trailling NULL, when checking if there is enough
place in the destination buffer.


While at it, also replace a 'sprintf' by a safer 'snprintf', check for
output truncation and avoid a superfluous 'strlen'.
