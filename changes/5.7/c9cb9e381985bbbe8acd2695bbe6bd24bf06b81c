gfs2: don't call quota_unhold if quotas are not locked

Before this patch, function gfs2_quota_unlock checked if quotas are
turned off, and if so, it branched to label out, which called
gfs2_quota_unhold. With the new system of gfs2_qa_get and put, we
no longer want to call gfs2_quota_unhold or we won't balance our
gets and puts.
