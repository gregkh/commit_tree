ALSA: usb-audio: Quirks for Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Master onboard audio

Gigabyte TRX40 Aorus Master is equipped with two USB-audio devices,
a Realtek ALC1220-VB codec (USB ID 0414:a001) and an ESS SABRE9218 DAC
(USB ID 0414:a000).  The latter serves solely for the headphone output
on the front panel while the former serves for the rest I/Os (mostly
for the I/Os in the rear panel but also including the front mic).

Both chips do work more or less with the unmodified USB-audio driver,
but there are a few glitches.  The ALC1220-VB returns an error for an
inquiry to some jacks, as already seen on other TRX40-based mobos.
However this machine has a slightly incompatible configuration, hence
the existing mapping cannot be used as is.

Meanwhile the ESS chip seems working without any quirk.  But since
both audio devices don't provide any specific names, both cards appear
as "USB-Audio", and it's quite confusing for users.

This patch is an attempt to overcome those issues:

- The specific mapping table for ALC1220-VB is provided, reducing the
  non-working nodes and renaming the badly chosen controls.
  The connector map isn't needed here unlike other TRX40 quirks.

- For both USB IDs (0414:a000 and 0414:a001), provide specific card
  name strings, so that user-space can identify more easily; and more
  importantly, UCM profile can be applied to each.
