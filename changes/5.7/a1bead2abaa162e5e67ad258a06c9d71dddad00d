KVM: VMX: Directly query Intel PT mode when refreshing PMUs

Use vmx_pt_mode_is_host_guest() in intel_pmu_refresh() instead of
bouncing through kvm_x86_ops->pt_supported, and remove ->pt_supported()
as the PMU code was the last remaining user.

Opportunistically clean up the wording of a comment that referenced
kvm_x86_ops->pt_supported().

No functional change intended.
