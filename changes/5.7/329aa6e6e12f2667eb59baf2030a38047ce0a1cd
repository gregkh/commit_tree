n_gsm: introduce enum gsm_mux_state

gsm_mux->state is clearly an enumeration. So introduce one and use it
-- compiler now checks if valid values are assigned to the field.

Note that a compiler warns about unhandled cases in switch. Add default
cases with a pr_debug (which is not printed by default).

The values of the states are preserved thanks to the nature of enum.
