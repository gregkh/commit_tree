cpu/hotplug: Hide cpu_up/down()

Use separate functions for the device core to bring a CPU up and down.

Users outside the device core must use add/remove_cpu() which will take
care of extra housekeeping work like keeping sysfs in sync.

Make cpu_up/down() static and replace the extra layer of indirection.

[ tglx: Removed the extra wrapper functions and adjusted function names ]
