arm64: tegra: Add EEPROM supplies

The following warning is observed on Jetson TX1, Jetson Nano and Jetson
TX2 platforms because the supply regulators are not specified for the
EEPROMs.

 WARNING KERN at24 0-0050: 0-0050 supply vcc not found, using dummy regulator
 WARNING KERN at24 0-0057: 0-0057 supply vcc not found, using dummy regulator

For both of these platforms the EEPROM is powered by the main 1.8V
supply rail and so populate the supply for these devices to fix these
warnings.
