clk: sunxi-ng: sun8i-de2: H6 doesn't have rotate core

DE3 documentation regarding presence of rotate core in H6 is a bit
confusing. Register descriptions mention bits for enabling rotate core
clocks and reset, but general overview doesn't list it as feature of H6
display engine, BSP kernel doesn't support it and there is no interrupt
listed for it. Manual poking registers also didn't reveal presence of
rotate core.

Let's assume there isn't any rotate core on H6 present and remove
related clocks. With that done, structures are same as those for H5, so
just reuse H5 structure.
