ACPI: EC: Do not clear boot_ec_is_ecdt in acpi_ec_add()

The reason for clearing boot_ec_is_ecdt in acpi_ec_add() (if a
PNP0C09 device object matching the ECDT boot EC had been found in
the namespace) was to cause acpi_ec_ecdt_start() to return early,
but since the latter does not look at boot_ec_is_ecdt any more,
acpi_ec_add() need not clear it.

Moreover, doing that may be confusing as it may cause "DSDT" to be
printed instead of "ECDT" in the EC initialization completion
message, so stop doing it.

While at it, split the EC initialization completion message into
two messages, one regarding the boot EC and another one printed
regardless of whether or not the EC at hand is the boot one.
