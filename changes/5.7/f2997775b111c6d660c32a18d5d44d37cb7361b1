rtc: sa1100: fix possible race condition

Both RTC IRQs are requested before the struct rtc_device is allocated,
this may lead to a NULL pointer dereference in the IRQ handler.

To fix this issue, allocating the rtc_device struct before requesting
the IRQs using devm_rtc_allocate_device, and use rtc_register_device
to register the RTC device.
