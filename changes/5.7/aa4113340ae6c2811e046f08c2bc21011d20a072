powerpc/fsl_booke: Avoid creating duplicate tlb1 entry

In the current implementation, the call to loadcam_multi() is wrapped
between switch_to_as1() and restore_to_as0() calls so, when it tries
to create its own temporary AS=1 TLB1 entry, it ends up duplicating
the existing one created by switch_to_as1(). Add a check to skip
creating the temporary entry if already running in AS=1.
