iommu: Use C99 flexible array in fwspec

Although the 1-element array was a typical pre-C99 way to implement
variable-length structures, and indeed is a fundamental construct in the
APIs of certain other popular platforms, there's no good reason for it
here (and in particular the sizeof() trick is far too "clever" for its
own good). We can just as easily implement iommu_fwspec's preallocation
behaviour using a standard flexible array member, so let's make it look
the way most readers would expect.
