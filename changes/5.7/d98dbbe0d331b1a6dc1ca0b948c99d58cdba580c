scripts: documentation-file-ref-check: Add line break before exit

If execute ./scripts/documentation-file-ref-check in a directory which is
not a git tree, it will exit without a line break, fix it.

[loongson@localhost linux-5.7-rc1]$ ./scripts/documentation-file-ref-check
Warning: can't check if file exists, as this is not a git tree[loongson@localhost linux-5.7-rc1]$
