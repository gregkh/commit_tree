ASoC: SOF: Intel: add min/max channels for SSP on Baytrail/Broadwell

Major regressions were detected by SOF CI on CherryTrail and Broadwell:

[   25.705750]  SSP2-Codec: ASoC: no backend playback stream
[   27.923378]  SSP2-Codec: ASoC: no users playback at close - state

This is root-caused to the introduction of the DAI capability checks
with snd_soc_dai_stream_valid(). Its use in soc-pcm.c makes it a
requirement for all DAIs to report at least a non-zero min_channels
field.

For some reason the SSP structures used for SKL+ did provide this
information but legacy platforms didn't.
