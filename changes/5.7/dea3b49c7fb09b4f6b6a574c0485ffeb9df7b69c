io_uring: keep all sqe->flags in req->flags

It's a good idea to not read sqe->flags twice, as it's prone to security
bugs. Instead of passing it around, embeed them in req->flags. It's
already so except for IOSQE_IO_LINK.
1. rename former REQ_F_LINK -> REQ_F_LINK_HEAD
2. introduce and copy REQ_F_LINK, which mimics IO_IOSQE_LINK

And leave req_set_fail_links() using new REQ_F_LINK, because it's more
sensible.
