KVM: x86: Move XSAVES CPUID adjust to VMX's KVM cpu cap update

Move the clearing of the XSAVES CPUID bit into VMX, which has a separate
VMCS control to enable XSAVES in non-root, to eliminate the last ugly
renmant of the undesirable "unsigned f_* = *_supported ? F(*) : 0"
pattern in the common CPUID handling code.

Drop ->xsaves_supported(), CPUID adjustment was the only user.

No functional change intended.
