USB: Select better matching USB drivers when available

Now that USB device drivers can reuse code from the generic USB device
driver, we need to make sure that they get selected rather than the
generic driver. Add an id_table and match vfunc to the usb_device_driver
struct, which will get used to select a better matching driver at
->probe time.

This is a similar mechanism to that used in the HID drivers, with the
generic driver being selected unless there's a better matching one found
in the registered drivers (see hid_generic_match() in
drivers/hid/hid-generic.c).
