ovl: fix value of i_ino for lower hardlink corner case

Commit 6dde1e42f497 ("ovl: make i_ino consistent with st_ino in more
cases"), relaxed the condition nfs_export=on in order to set the value of
i_ino to xino map of real ino.

Specifically, it also relaxed the pre-condition that index=on for
consistent i_ino. This opened the corner case of lower hardlink in
ovl_get_inode(), which calls ovl_fill_inode() with ino=0 and then
ovl_init_inode() is called to set i_ino to lower real ino without the xino
mapping.

Pass the correct values of ino;fsid in this case to ovl_fill_inode(), so it
can initialize i_ino correctly.
