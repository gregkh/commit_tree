x86/entry/64: Fix unwind hints in __switch_to_asm()

UNWIND_HINT_FUNC has some limitations: specifically, it doesn't reset
all the registers to undefined.  This causes objtool to get confused
about the RBP push in __switch_to_asm(), resulting in bad ORC data.

While __switch_to_asm() does do some stack magic, it's otherwise a
normal callable-from-C function, so just annotate it as a function,
which makes objtool happy and allows it to produces the correct hints
automatically.
