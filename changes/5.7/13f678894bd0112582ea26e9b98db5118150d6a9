KVM: Don't free new memslot if allocation of said memslot fails

The two implementations of kvm_arch_create_memslot() in x86 and PPC are
both good citizens and free up all local resources if creation fails.
Return immediately (via a superfluous goto) instead of calling
kvm_free_memslot().

Note, the call to kvm_free_memslot() is effectively an expensive nop in
this case as there are no resources to be freed.

No functional change intended.
