cgroup.c: Use built-in RCU list checking

list_for_each_entry_rcu has built-in RCU and lock checking.
Pass cond argument to list_for_each_entry_rcu() to silence
false lockdep warning when  CONFIG_PROVE_RCU_LIST is enabled
by default.

Even though the function css_next_child() already checks if
cgroup_mutex or rcu_read_lock() is held using
cgroup_assert_mutex_or_rcu_locked(), there is a need to pass
cond to list_for_each_entry_rcu() to avoid false positive
lockdep warning.
