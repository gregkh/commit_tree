media: uapi: h264: Add DPB entry field reference flags

Using the field information attached to v4l2 buffers is not enough to
determine the type of field referenced by a DPB entry: the decoded
frame might contain the full picture (both top and bottom fields)
but the reference only point to one of them.
Let's add new V4L2_H264_DPB_ENTRY_FLAG_ flags to express that.

[Keep only 2 flags and add some details about they mean]
