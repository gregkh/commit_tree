mm/gup: page->hpage_pinned_refcount: exact pin counts for huge pages

For huge pages (and in fact, any compound page), the GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS
scheme tends to overflow too easily, each tail page increments the head
page->_refcount by GUP_PIN_COUNTING_BIAS (1024).  That limits the number
of huge pages that can be pinned.

This patch removes that limitation, by using an exact form of pin counting
for compound pages of order > 1.  The "order > 1" is required because this
approach uses the 3rd struct page in the compound page, and order 1
compound pages only have two pages, so that won't work there.

A new struct page field, hpage_pinned_refcount, has been added, replacing
a padding field in the union (so no new space is used).

This enhancement also has a useful side effect: huge pages and compound
pages (of order > 1) do not suffer from the "potential false positives"
problem that is discussed in the page_dma_pinned() comment block.  That is
because these compound pages have extra space for tracking things, so they
get exact pin counts instead of overloading page->_refcount.

Documentation/core-api/pin_user_pages.rst is updated accordingly.
