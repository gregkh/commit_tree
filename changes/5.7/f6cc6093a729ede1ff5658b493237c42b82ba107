UAS: fix deadlock in error handling and PM flushing work

A SCSI error handler and block runtime PM must not allocate
memory with GFP_KERNEL. Furthermore they must not wait for
tasks allocating memory with GFP_KERNEL.
That means that they cannot share a workqueue with arbitrary tasks.

Fix this for UAS using a private workqueue.
