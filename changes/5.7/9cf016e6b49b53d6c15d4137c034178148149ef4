lib: test_stackinit.c: XFAIL switch variable init tests

The tests for initializing a variable defined between a switch statement's
test and its first "case" statement are currently not initialized in
Clang[1] nor the proposed auto-initialization feature in GCC.

We should retain the test (so that we can evaluate compiler fixes), but
mark it as an "expected fail".  The rest of the kernel source will be
adjusted to avoid this corner case.

Also disable -Wswitch-unreachable for the test so that the intentionally
broken code won't trigger warnings for GCC (nor future Clang) when
initialization happens this unhandled place.
