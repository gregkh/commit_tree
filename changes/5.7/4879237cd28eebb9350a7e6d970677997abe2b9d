scsi: qla2xxx: Handle cases for limiting RDP response payload length

This patch reduces RDP response payload length, if requesting port is a
domain controller (sid 0xfffc01) and fw is earlier than 8.09.00 and fw is
not 8.05.65 then limit the RDP response payload length to maximum of 256
bytes by terminating the response just before the optical element
descriptor.
