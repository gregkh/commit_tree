staging: comedi: Fix comedi_device refcnt leak in comedi_open

comedi_open() invokes comedi_dev_get_from_minor(), which returns a
reference of the COMEDI device to "dev" with increased refcount.

When comedi_open() returns, "dev" becomes invalid, so the refcount
should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.

The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
comedi_open(). When "cfp" allocation is failed, the refcnt increased by
comedi_dev_get_from_minor() is not decreased, causing a refcnt leak.

Fix this issue by calling comedi_dev_put() on this error path when "cfp"
allocation is failed.
