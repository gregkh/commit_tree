gfs2: eliminate gfs2_rsqa_alloc in favor of gfs2_qa_alloc

Before this patch, multiple callers called gfs2_rsqa_alloc to force
the existence of a reservations structure and a quota data structure
if needed. However, now the reservations are handled separately, so
the quota data is only the quota data. So we eliminate the one in
favor of just calling gfs2_qa_alloc directly.
