powerpc: Update MAINTAINERS

A while back Paul pointed out I'd been maintaining the tree more or
less solo for over five years, so perhaps it's time to update the
MAINTAINERS entry.

Ben & Paul still wrote most of the code, so keep them as Reviewers so
they still get Cc'ed on things. But if you're wondering why your patch
hasn't been merged that's my fault.
