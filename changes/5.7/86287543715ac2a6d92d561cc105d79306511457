net: atlantic: fix missing | operator when assigning rec->llc

rec->llc is currently being assigned twice, once with the lower 8 bits
from packed_record[8] and then re-assigned afterwards with data from
packed_record[9].  This looks like a type, I believe the second assignment
should be using the |= operator rather than a direct assignment.
