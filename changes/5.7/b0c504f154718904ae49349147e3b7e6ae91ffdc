virtio-balloon: add support for providing free page reports to host

Add support for the page reporting feature provided by virtio-balloon.
Reporting differs from the regular balloon functionality in that is is
much less durable than a standard memory balloon.  Instead of creating a
list of pages that cannot be accessed the pages are only inaccessible
while they are being indicated to the virtio interface.  Once the
interface has acknowledged them they are placed back into their respective
free lists and are once again accessible by the guest system.

Unlike a standard balloon we don't inflate and deflate the pages.  Instead
we perform the reporting, and once the reporting is completed it is
assumed that the page has been dropped from the guest and will be faulted
back in the next time the page is accessed.
