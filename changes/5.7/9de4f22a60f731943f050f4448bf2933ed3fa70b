mm: code cleanup for MADV_FREE

Some comments for MADV_FREE is revised and added to help people understand
the MADV_FREE code, especially the page flag, PG_swapbacked.  This makes
page_is_file_cache() isn't consistent with its comments.  So the function
is renamed to page_is_file_lru() to make them consistent again.  All these
are put in one patch as one logical change.
