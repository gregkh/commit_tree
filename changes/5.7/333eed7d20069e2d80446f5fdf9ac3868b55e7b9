PM: QoS: Simplify definitions of CPU latency QoS trace events

Modify the definitions of the CPU latency QoS trace events to take
one argument (since PM_QOS_CPU_DMA_LATENCY is always passed as the
pm_qos_class argument to them) and update the documentation of them
accordingly (while at it, make it explicitly mention CPU latency QoS
and relocate it after the device PM QoS trace events documentation).

The names and output format of the trace events do not change to
preserve user space compatibility.

No intentional functional impact.
