ACPI: Add new tiny-power-button driver to directly signal init

Virtual machines often use an ACPI power button event to tell the
machine to shut down gracefully.

Provide an extremely lightweight "tiny power button" driver to handle
this event by signaling init directly, rather than running a separate
daemon (such as acpid or systemd-logind) that adds to startup time and
VM image complexity.

The kernel configuration defines the default signal to send init, and
userspace can change this signal via a module parameter.
