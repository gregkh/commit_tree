net/mlx5: Verify goto chain offload support

According to PRM, forward to flow table along with either packet
reformat or decap is supported only if reformat_and_fwd_to_table
capability is set for the flow table.

Add dependency on the capability and pack all the conditions for "goto
chain" in a single function.

Fix language in error message in case of not supporting forward to a
lower numbered flow table.
