Input: i8042 - add ThinkPad S230u to i8042 nomux list

On the Lenovo ThinkPad Twist S230u (3347-4HU) with BIOS version
"GDETC1WW (1.81 ) 06/27/2019", whether booted in UEFI or Legacy/CSM mode
the keyboard, Synaptics TouchPad, and TrackPoint either do not function
or stop functioning a few minutes after boot.  This problem has been
noted before, perhaps only occurring on BIOS 1.57 and
later.[1][2][3][4][5]

This model does not have an external PS/2 port, so mux does not appear
to be useful.

Odds of a BIOS fix appear to be low: 1.57 was released over 6 years ago
and although the [BIOS changelog] notes "Fixed an issue of UEFI
touchpad/trackpoint/keyboard/touchscreen" in 1.58, it appears to be
insufficient.

Adding 33474HU to the nomux list avoids the issue on my system.
