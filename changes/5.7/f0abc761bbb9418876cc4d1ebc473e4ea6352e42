RDMA/core: Fix race between destroy and release FD object

The call to ->lookup_put() was too early and it caused an unlock of the
read/write protection of the uobject after the FD was put. This allows a
race:

     CPU1                                 CPU2
 rdma_lookup_put_uobject()
   lookup_put_fd_uobject()
     fput()
				   fput()
				     uverbs_uobject_fd_release()
				       WARN_ON(uverbs_try_lock_object(uobj,
					       UVERBS_LOOKUP_WRITE));
   atomic_dec(usecnt)

Fix the code by changing the order, first unlock and call to
->lookup_put() after that.
