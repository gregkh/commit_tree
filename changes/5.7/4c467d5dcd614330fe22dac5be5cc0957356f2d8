drm/i915/uc: autogenerate uC checker functions

We want to map uC-level checks to GuC/HuC-level ones. The mapping from
the uC state to the GuC/HuC one follows the same pattern for all the
functions:

 uc_xxx_guc() -> guc_is_yyy()

So we can easily use a macro to autogenerate the functions via macros by
passing in the 2 mapped states.
