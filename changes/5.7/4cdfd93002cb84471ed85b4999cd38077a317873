btrfs: handle NULL roots in btrfs_put/btrfs_grab_fs_root

We want to use this for dropping all roots, and in some error cases we
may not have a root, so handle this to make the cleanup code easier.
Make btrfs_grab_fs_root the same so we can use it in cases where the
root may not exist (like the quota root).
