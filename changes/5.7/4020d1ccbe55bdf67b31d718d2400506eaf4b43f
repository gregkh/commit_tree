ALSA: usb-audio: mixer: volume quirk for ESS Technology Asus USB DAC

The Asus USB DAC is a USB type-C audio dongle for connecting to
the headset and headphone. The volume minimum value -23040 which
is 0xa600 in hexadecimal with the resolution value 1 indicates
this should be endianness issue caused by the firmware bug. Add
a volume quirk to fix the volume control problem.

Also fixes this warning:
  Warning! Unlikely big volume range (=23040), cval->res is probably wrong.
  [5] FU [Headset Capture Volume] ch = 1, val = -23040/0/1

  [7] FU [Headset Playback Volume] ch = 1, val = -23040/0/1
