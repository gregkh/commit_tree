RDMA/uverbs: Move IB_EVENT_DEVICE_FATAL to destroy_uobj

When multiple async FDs were allowed to exist the idea was for all
broadcast events to be delivered to all async FDs, however
IB_EVENT_DEVICE_FATAL was missed.

Instead of having ib_uverbs_free_hw_resources() special case the global
async_fd, have it cause the event during the uobject destruction. Every
async fd is now a uobject so simply generate the IB_EVENT_DEVICE_FATAL
while destroying the async fd uobject. This ensures every async FD gets a
copy of the event.
