bpf, sockmap: Let all kernel-land lookup values in SOCKMAP/SOCKHASH

Don't require the kernel code, like BPF helpers, that needs access to
SOCK{MAP,HASH} map contents to live in net/core/sock_map.c. Expose the
lookup operation to all kernel-land.

Lookup from BPF context is not whitelisted yet. While syscalls have a
dedicated lookup handler.
