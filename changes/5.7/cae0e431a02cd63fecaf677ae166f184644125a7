x86/boot: Clear direction and interrupt flags in startup_64

startup_32 already clears these flags on entry, do it in startup_64 as
well for consistency.

The direction flag in particular is not specified to be cleared in the
boot protocol documentation, and we currently call into C code
(paging_prepare) without explicitly clearing it.
