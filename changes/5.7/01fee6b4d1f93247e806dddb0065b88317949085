selftests/resctrl: Add MBA test

MBA (Memory Bandwidth Allocation) test starts a stressful memory
bandwidth benchmark and allocates memory bandwidth from 100% down
to 10% for the benchmark process. For each allocation, compare
perf IMC counter and mbm total bytes from resctrl. The difference
between the two values should be within a threshold to pass the test.

Default benchmark is built-in fill_buf. But users can specify their
own benchmark by option "-b".

We can add memory bandwidth allocation for multiple processes in the
future.
