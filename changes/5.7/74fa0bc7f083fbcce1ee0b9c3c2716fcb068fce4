KVM: x86: Hoist loop counter and terminator to top of __do_cpuid_func()

Declare "i" and "max_idx" at the top of __do_cpuid_func() to consolidate
a handful of declarations in various case statements.

More importantly, establish the pattern of using max_idx instead of e.g.
entry->eax as the loop terminator in preparation for refactoring how
entry is handled in __do_cpuid_func().

No functional change intended.
