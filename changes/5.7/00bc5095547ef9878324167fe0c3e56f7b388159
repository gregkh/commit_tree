vfio-pci/nvlink2: Allow fallback to ibm,mmio-atsd[0]

Older versions of skiboot only provide a single value in the device
tree property "ibm,mmio-atsd", even when multiple Address Translation
Shoot Down (ATSD) registers are present. This prevents NVLink2 devices
(other than the first) from being used with vfio-pci because vfio-pci
expects to be able to assign a dedicated ATSD register to each NVLink2
device.

However, ATSD registers can be shared among devices. This change
allows vfio-pci to fall back to sharing the register at index 0 if
necessary.
