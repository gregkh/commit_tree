scsi: qla2xxx: Fix hang when issuing nvme disconnect-all in NPIV

In NPIV environment, a NPIV host may use a queue pair created by base host
or other NPIVs, so the check for a queue pair created by this NPIV is not
correct, and can cause an abort to fail, which in turn means the NVME
command not returned.  This leads to hang in nvme_fc layer in
nvme_fc_delete_association() which waits for all I/Os to be returned, which
is seen as hang in the application.
