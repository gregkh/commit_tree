net: bmac: Fix read of MAC address from ROM

In bmac_get_station_address, We're reading two bytes at a time from ROM,
but we do that six times, resulting in 12 bytes of read & writes. This
means we will write off the end of the six-byte destination buffer.

This change fixes the for-loop to only read/write six bytes.

Based on a proposed fix from Finn Thain <fthain@telegraphics.com.au>.
