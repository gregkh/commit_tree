scsi: lpfc: add RDF registration and Link Integrity FPIN logging

This patch modifies lpfc to register for Link Integrity events via the use
of an RDF ELS and to perform Link Integrity FPIN logging.

Specifically, the driver was modified to:

 - Format and issue the RDF ELS immediately following SCR registration.
   This registers the ability of the driver to receive FPIN ELS.

 - Adds decoding of the FPIN els into the received descriptors, with
   logging of the Link Integrity event information. After decoding, the ELS
   is delivered to the scsi fc transport to be delivered to any user-space
   applications.

 - To aid in logging, simple helpers were added to create enum to name
   string lookup functions that utilize the initialization helpers from the
   fc_els.h header.

 - Note: base header definitions for the ELS's don't populate the
   descriptor payloads. As such, lpfc creates it's own version of the
   structures, using the base definitions (mostly headers) and additionally
   declaring the descriptors that will complete the population of the ELS.
