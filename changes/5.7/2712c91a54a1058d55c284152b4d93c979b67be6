Input: i8042 - add ThinkPad S230u to i8042 reset list

On the Lenovo ThinkPad Twist S230u (3347-4HU) with BIOS version
"GDETC1WW (1.81 ) 06/27/2019", the keyboard, Synaptics TouchPad, and
TrackPoint either do not function or stop functioning a few minutes
after boot.  This problem has been noted before, perhaps only occurring
with BIOS 1.57 and later.[1][2][3][4][5]

Odds of a BIOS fix appear to be low: 1.57 was released over 6 years ago
and although the [BIOS changelog] notes "Fixed an issue of UEFI
touchpad/trackpoint/keyboard/touchscreen" in 1.58, it appears to be
insufficient.

Setting i8042.reset=1 or adding 33474HU to the reset list avoids the
issue on my system from either warm or cold boot.
