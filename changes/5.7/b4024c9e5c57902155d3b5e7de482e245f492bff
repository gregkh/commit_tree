felix: Fix initialization of ioremap resources

The caller of devm_ioremap_resource(), either accidentally
or by wrong assumption, is writing back derived resource data
to global static resource initialization tables that should
have been constant.  Meaning that after it computes the final
physical start address it saves the address for no reason
in the static tables.  This doesn't affect the first driver
probing after reboot, but it breaks consecutive driver reloads
(i.e. driver unbind & bind) because the initialization tables
no longer have the correct initial values.  So the next probe()
will map the device registers to wrong physical addresses,
causing ARM SError async exceptions.
This patch fixes all of the above.
