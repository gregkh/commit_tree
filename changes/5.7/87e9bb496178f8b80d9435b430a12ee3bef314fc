drm/i915/dsi: Enable ICL DSI transcoder as part of encoder->enable

Enable the dsi transcoder, panel and backlight as part of
encoder->enable and not encoder->pre_enable. We need to have pipe src
size, among other things, set before enabling the transcoder, to avoid
FIFO underruns and possibly other issues.

v2 by Jani:
- Rebase on the crtc enable sequence update
