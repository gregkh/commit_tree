net: phylink: improve initial mac configuration

Improve the initial MAC configuration so we get a configuration which
more represents the final operating mode, in particular with respect
to the flow control settings.

We do this by:
1) more fully initialising our phy state, so we can use this as the
   initial state for PHY based connections.
2) reading the fixed link state.
3) ensuring that in-band mode has sane pause settings for SGMII vs
   802.3z negotiation modes.

In all three cases, we ensure that state->link is false, just in case
any MAC drivers have other ideas by mis-using this member, and we also
take account of manual pause mode configuration at this point.

This avoids MLO_PAUSE_AN being seen in mac_config() when operating in
PHY, fixed mode or inband SGMII mode, thereby giving cleaner semantics
to the pause flags.  As a result of this, the pause flags now indicate
in a mode-independent way what is required from a mac_config()
implementation.
