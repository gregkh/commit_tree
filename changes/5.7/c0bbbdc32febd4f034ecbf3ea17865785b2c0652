__netif_receive_skb_core: pass skb by reference

__netif_receive_skb_core may change the skb pointer passed into it (e.g.
in rx_handler). The original skb may be freed as a result of this
operation.

The callers of __netif_receive_skb_core may further process original skb
by using pt_prev pointer returned by __netif_receive_skb_core thus
leading to unpleasant effects.

The solution is to pass skb by reference into __netif_receive_skb_core.

v2: Added Fixes tag and comment regarding ppt_prev and skb invariant.
