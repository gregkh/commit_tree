gpiolib: improve the robustness of watch/unwatch ioctl()

This makes the new ioctl() a bit more robust - we now check if a line
is already being watched and return -EBUSY if the user-space tries to
start watching it again. Same for unwatch - return -EBUSY if user-space
tries to unwatch a line that's not being watched.
