x86: ia32_setup_frame(): consolidate uaccess areas

Currently we have user_access block, followed by __put_user(),
deciding what the restorer will be and finally a put_user_try
block.

Moving the calculation of restorer first allows the rest
(actual copyout work) to coalesce into a single user_access block.
