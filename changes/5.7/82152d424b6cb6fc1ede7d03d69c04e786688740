Make the "Reducing compressed framebufer size" message be DRM_INFO_ONCE()

This was sort of annoying me:

random:~$ dmesg | tail -1
[523884.039227] [drm] Reducing the compressed framebuffer size. This may lead to less power savings than a non-reduced-size. Try to increase stolen memory size if available in BIOS.
random:~$ dmesg | grep -c "Reducing the compressed"
47

This patch makes it DRM_INFO_ONCE() just like the similar message
farther down in that function is pr_info_once().
