ASoC: codecs: wsa881x: remove soundwire stream handling

There could be multiple instances of this codec on any platform,
so handling stream directly in this codec driver can lead to
multiple calls to prepare/enable/disable on the same SoundWire stream.
Move this stream handling to machine driver to fix this issue.
