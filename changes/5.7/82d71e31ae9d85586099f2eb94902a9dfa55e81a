drm/i915/gt: Poison GTT scratch pages

Using a clear page for scratch means that we have relatively benign
errors in case it is accidentally used, but that can be rather too
benign for debugging. If we poison the scratch, ideally it quickly
results in an obvious error.

v2: Set each page individually just in case we are using highmem for our
scratch page.
v3: Pick a new scratch register as MI_STORE_REGISTER_MEM does not work
with GPR0 on gen7, unbelievably.
v4: Haswell still considers 3DPRIM a privileged register!
