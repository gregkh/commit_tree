usb: gadget: composite: Inform controller driver of self-powered

Different configuration/condition may draw different power. Inform the
controller driver of the change so it can respond properly (e.g.
GET_STATUS request). This fixes an issue with setting MaxPower from
configfs. The composite driver doesn't check this value when setting
self-powered.
