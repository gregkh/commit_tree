iio: adc: xilinx: fix potential use-after-free on remove

When cancel_delayed_work() returns, the delayed work may still
be running. This means that the core could potentially free
the private structure (struct xadc) while the delayed work
is still using it. This is a potential use-after-free.

Fix by calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), which waits for
any residual work to finish before returning.
