ext4: replace opencoded i_writecount usage with inode_is_open_for_write()

There is a function which clearly conveys the objective of checking
i_writecount. Additionally the usage in ext4_mb_initialize_context was
wrong, since a node would have wrongfully been reported as writable if
i_writecount had a negative value (MMAP_DENY_WRITE).
