ARM: dts: sun8i: a83t: Enable PMIC power supplies on various boards

On the Bananapi M3 and Cubietruck Plus, the DC input jacks are wired to
the ACIN pins, which is represented by the AC power supply. Both boards
have connectors for LiPo batteries, which are represented by the battery
power supply.

The H8 Homlet is a set-top box design. The DC input jack is wired to the
ACIN pins, but there are no battery connectors.

Enable these power supplies in the device tree.
