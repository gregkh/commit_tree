PCI: ibmphp: Turn semaphores into completions or mutexes

The sem_exit variable is conceptually a completion, so it should be called
that.

Similarly, the semOperations semaphore is a simple mutex, and can be
changed into that, respectively.

With both converted, the ibmphp_hpc_initvars() function is no longer used
and can be removed.
