powerpc/dma: untangle vio_dma_mapping_ops from dma_iommu_ops

vio_dma_mapping_ops currently does a lot of indirect calls through
dma_iommu_ops, which not only make the code harder to follow but are
also expensive in the post-spectre world.  Unwind the indirect calls
by calling the ppc_iommu_* or iommu_* APIs directly applicable, or
just use the dma_iommu_* methods directly where we can.
