serial: sh-sci: Fix setting SCSCR_TIE while transferring data

We disable transmission interrupt (clear SCSCR_TIE) after all data has been transmitted
(if uart_circ_empty(xmit)). While transmitting, if the data is still in the tty buffer,
re-enable the SCSCR_TIE bit, which was done at sci_start_tx().
This is unnecessary processing, wasting CPU operation if the data transmission length is large.
And further, transmit end, FIFO empty bits disabling have also been performed in the step above.
