iwlwifi: fix bad dma handling in page_mem dumping flow

Prior to gen2 we allocate the paging memory via alloc_pages
which requires passing ownership on the memory between the
cpu and the device using dma_sync_single_for_cpu and
dma_sync_single_for_device.

Add missing dma_sync_single_for_device in iwl_dump_paging
after copying the memory.

since gen2, we allocate the paging memory using dma_alloc_coherent
which does not need passing ownership between the cpu and device.

Remove unneeded call to dma_sync_single_for_cpu in
iwl_trans_pcie_dump_data prior to copying the memory.
