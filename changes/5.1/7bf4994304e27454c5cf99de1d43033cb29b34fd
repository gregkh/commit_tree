btrfs: plumb level through the compression interface

Zlib compression supports multiple levels, but doesn't require changing
in how a workspace itself is created and managed. Zstd introduces a
different memory requirement such that higher levels of compression
require more memory.

This requires changes in how the alloc()/get() methods work for zstd.
This pach plumbs compression level through the interface as a parameter
in preparation for zstd compression levels.  This gives the compression
types opportunity to create/manage based on the compression level.
