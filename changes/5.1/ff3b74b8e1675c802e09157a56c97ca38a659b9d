blk-mq: add trace block plug and unplug for multiple queues

For now, we just trace plug for single queue device or drivers
provide .commit_rqs, and have not trace plug for multiple queues
device. But, unplug events will be recorded when call
blk_mq_flush_plug_list(). Then, trace events will be asymmetrical,
just have unplug and without plug.

This patch add trace plug and unplug for multiple queues device in
blk_mq_make_request(). After that, we can accurately trace plug and
unplug for multiple queues.
