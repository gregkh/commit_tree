tty: ldisc: add sysctl to prevent autoloading of ldiscs

By default, the kernel will automatically load the module of any line
dicipline that is asked for.  As this sometimes isn't the safest thing
to do, provide a sysctl to disable this feature.

By default, we set this to 'y' as that is the historical way that Linux
has worked, and we do not want to break working systems.  But in the
future, perhaps this can default to 'n' to prevent this functionality.
