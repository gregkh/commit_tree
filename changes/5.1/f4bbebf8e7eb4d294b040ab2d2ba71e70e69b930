drm/amd/display: extending AUX SW Timeout

[Why]
AUX takes longer to reply when using active DP-DVI dongle on some asics
resulting in up to 2000+ us edid read (timeout).

[How]
1. Adjust AUX poll to match spec
2. Extend the SW timeout. This does not affect normal
operation since we exit the loop as soon as AUX acks.
