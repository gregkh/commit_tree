media: lgdt330x: fix lock status reporting

A typo in code cleanup commit db9c1007bc07 ("media: lgdt330x: do
some cleanups at status logic") broke the FE_HAS_LOCK reporting
for 3303 chips by inadvertently modifying the register mask.

The broken lock status is critial as it prevents video capture
cards from reporting signal strength, scanning for channels,
and capturing video.

Fix regression by reverting mask change.
