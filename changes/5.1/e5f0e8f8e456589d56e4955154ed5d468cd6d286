net: sched: introduce and use qdisc tree flush/purge helpers

The same code to flush qdisc tree and purge the qdisc queue
is duplicated in many places and in most cases it does not
respect NOLOCK qdisc: the global backlog len is used and the
per CPU values are ignored.

This change addresses the above, factoring-out the relevant
code and using the helpers introduced by the previous patch
to fetch the correct backlog len.
