arm64: tegra: custom name for hda sound card

"nvidia,model" property is added to pass custom name for hda sound card.
This is parsed in hda driver and used for card name. This aligns with the
way with which sound cards are named in general.

This patch populates above for jetson-tx1, jetson-tx2 and jetson-xavier.
