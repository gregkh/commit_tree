rtc: support for the Amlogic Meson RTC

Add support for the RTC block on the 32-bit Amlogic Meson6, Meson8,
Meson8b and Meson8m2 SoCs.

The RTC is split in to two parts, which are both managed by this driver:
- the AHB front end
- and a simple serial connection to the actual registers

The RTC_COUNTER register which holds the time is 32-bits wide.

There are four 32-bit wide (in total: 16 bytes) "regmem" registers which
are exposed using nvmem. On Amlogic's 3.10 kernel this is used to store
data which needs to survive a suspend / resume cycle.
