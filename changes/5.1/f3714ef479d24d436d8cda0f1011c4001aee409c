btrfs: Refactor btrfs_get_extent_fiemap

Make btrfs_get_extent_fiemap a bit more friendly. First step is to
rename the closely related, yet arbitrary named
range_start/found_end/found variables. They define the delalloc range
that is found in case a real extent wasn't found. Subsequently remove
an unnecessary check for hole_em since it's guaranteed to be set i.e the
check is always true. Top it off by giving all comments a refresh.

No functional changes.
