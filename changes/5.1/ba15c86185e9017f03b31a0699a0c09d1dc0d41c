RISC-V: Remove NR_CPUs check during hartid search from DT

In non-smp configuration, hartid can be higher that NR_CPUS.
riscv_of_processor_hartid should not be compared to hartid to NR_CPUS in
that case. Moreover, this function checks all the DT properties of a
hart node. NR_CPUS comparison seems out of place.
