rcu: Determine expedited-GP IPI handler at build time

Back when there could be multiple RCU flavors running in the same kernel
at the same time, it was necessary to specify the expedited grace-period
IPI handler at runtime.  Now that there is only one RCU flavor, the
IPI handler can be determined at build time.  There is therefore no
longer any reason for the RCU-preempt and RCU-sched IPI handlers to
have different names, nor is there any reason to pass these handlers in
function arguments and in the data structures enclosing workqueues.

This commit therefore makes all these changes, pushing the specification
of the expedited grace-period IPI handler down to the point of use.
