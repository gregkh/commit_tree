y2038: remove struct definition redirects

We now use 64-bit time_t on all architectures, so the __kernel_timex,
__kernel_timeval and __kernel_timespec redirects can be removed
after having served their purpose.

This makes it all much less confusing, as the __kernel_* types
now always refer to the same layout based on 64-bit time_t across
all 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.
