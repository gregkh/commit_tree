kbuild: hardcode genksyms path and remove GENKSYMS variable

The genksyms source was integrated into the kernel tree in 2003.

I do not expect anybody still using the external /sbin/genksyms.
Kbuild does not need to provide the ability to override GENKSYMS.

Let's remove the GENKSYMS variable, and use the hardcoded path.

Since it occurred in the pre-git era, I attached the commit message
in case somebody is interested in the historical background.

  | kbuild: [PATCH] put genksyms in scripts dir
  |
  | This puts genksyms into scripts/genksyms/.
  |
  | genksyms used to be maintained externally, though the only possible user
  | was the kernel build. Moving it into the kernel sources makes it easier to
  | keep it uptodate, like for example updating it to generate linker scripts
  | directly instead of postprocessing the generated header file fragments
  | with sed, as we do currently.
  |
  | Also, genksyms does not handle __typeof__, which needs to be fixed since
  | some of the exported symbol in the kernel are defined using __typeof__.
