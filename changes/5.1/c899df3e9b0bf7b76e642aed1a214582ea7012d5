ASoC:intel:skl:fix a simultaneous playback & capture issue on hda platform

If playback and capture are enabled concurrently, when the capture stops
the output becomes inaudile. The playback application will become stuck
and underrun after a timeout.

This is caused by mistaken use of the stream_id, which should only be
set for playback and not for capture

Tested on Apollolake and Kabylake with SST driver.
