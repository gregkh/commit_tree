platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Include Reserved IP for LTR

Recently introduced commit "platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Show Latency
Tolerance info <51337cd94d18184601ac0fb4cf1a02b8bbabc3d7> skipped the
LTR from a reserved IP. Though this doesn't cause any functional issue
but it is needed for the consumers of "ltr_ignore" as the index printing
for "ltr_show" is missing. For example, w/o this change, a user that wants
to ignore LTR from ME would do something like

echo 5 > ltr_ignore

but the index for ME is 6. Printing a reserved IP helps to properly
calculate LTR ignore offsets.
