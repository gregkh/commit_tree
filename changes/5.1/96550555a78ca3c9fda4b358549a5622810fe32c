drm/i915: Pass down rc in intel_encoder->compute_config()

Something that I completely missed when implementing the new MST VCPI
atomic helpers is that with those helpers, there's technically a chance
of us having to grab additional modeset locks in ->compute_config() and
furthermore, that means we have the potential to hit a normal modeset
deadlock. However, because ->compute_config() only returns a bool this
means we can't return -EDEADLK when we need to drop locks and try again
which means we end up just failing the atomic check permanently. Whoops.

So, fix this by modifying ->compute_config() to pass down an actual
error code instead of a bool so that the atomic check can be restarted
on modeset deadlocks.

Thanks to Ville Syrjälä for pointing this out!

Changes since v1:
* Add some newlines
* Return only -EINVAL from hsw_crt_compute_config()
* Propogate return code from intel_dp_compute_dsc_params()
* Change all of the intel_dp_compute_link_config*() variants
* Don't miss if (hdmi_port_clock_valid()) branch in
  intel_hdmi_compute_config()
