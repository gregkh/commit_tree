ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix speakers on Acer Predator Helios 500 Ryzen laptops

On an Acer Predator Helios 500 (Ryzen version), the laptop's speakers
don't work out of the box.

The problem can be worked around with hdajackretask, remapping the
"Black Headphone, Right side" pin (0x21) to the Internal speaker.

This patch adds a quirk to change this mapping by default.
