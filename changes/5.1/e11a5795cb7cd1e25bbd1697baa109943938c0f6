perf/aux: Make perf_event accessible to setup_aux()

When pmu::setup_aux() is called the coresight PMU needs to know which
sink to use for the session by looking up the information in the
event's attr::config2 field.

As such simply replace the cpu information by the complete perf_event
structure and change all affected customers.
