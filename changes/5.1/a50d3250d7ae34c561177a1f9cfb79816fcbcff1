powerpc/64s: Make reliable stacktrace dependency clearer

Make the HAVE_RELIABLE_STACKTRACE Kconfig option depend on
PPC_BOOK3S_64 for documentation purposes. Before this patch, it
depended on PPC64 && CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN and because CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN
implies PPC_BOOK3S_64, there's no functional change here.
