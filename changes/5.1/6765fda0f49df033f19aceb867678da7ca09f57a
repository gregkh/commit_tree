habanalabs: fix validation of WREG32 to DMA completion

This patch fix a bug in the validation of WREG32 in DMA queues. The
validation was too strict. It allowed the user to set the completion
address only for DMA channel 1.

The fix allows the user to set the completion address for all 5 DMA
channels.
