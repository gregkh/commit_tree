crypto: arm64/aes-ccm - don't use an atomic walk needlessly

When the AES-CCM code was first added, the NEON register were saved
and restored eagerly, and so the code avoided doing so, and executed
the scatterwalk in atomic context inside the kernel_neon_begin/end
section.

This has been changed in the meantime, so switch to non-atomic
scatterwalks.
