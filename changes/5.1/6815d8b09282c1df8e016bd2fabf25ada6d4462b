ptp_qoriq: support external trigger stamp FIFO

The external trigger stamp FIFO was introduced as a new feature
for QorIQ 1588 timer IP block. This patch is to support it by
adding a new dts property "fsl,extts-fifo". Any QorIQ 1588 timer
supporting this feature is required to add this property in its
dts node.

In addition, the FIFO should be cleaned up before enabling external
trigger interrupts. Otherwise, there will be interrupts immediately
just after enabling external trigger interrupts.
