s390/setup: set control program code via diag 318

The s390x diagnose 318 instruction sets the control program name code (CPNC)
and control program version code (CPVC) to provide useful information
regarding the OS during debugging. The CPNC is explicitly set to 4 to
indicate a Linux/KVM environment.

The CPVC is a 7-byte value containing:

 - 3-byte Linux version code, currently set to 0
 - 3-byte unique value, currently set to 0
 - 1-byte trailing null
