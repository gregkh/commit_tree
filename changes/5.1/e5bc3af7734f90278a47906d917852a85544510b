rcu: Consolidate PREEMPT and !PREEMPT synchronize_rcu()

Now that rcu_blocking_is_gp() makes the correct immediate-return
decision for both PREEMPT and !PREEMPT, a single implementation of
synchronize_rcu() will work correctly under both configurations.
This commit therefore eliminates a few lines of code by consolidating
the two implementations of synchronize_rcu().
