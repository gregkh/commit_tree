clk: Add (devm_)clk_get_optional() functions

This adds clk_get_optional() and devm_clk_get_optional() functions to get
optional clocks.

They behave the same as (devm_)clk_get() except where there is no clock
producer. In this case, instead of returning -ENOENT, the function
returns NULL. This makes error checking simpler and allows
clk_prepare_enable, etc to be called on the returned reference
without additional checks.
