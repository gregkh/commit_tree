tcp: move snd_cwnd & snd_cwnd_cnt init to tcp_disconnect()

Passive connections can inherit proper value by cloning,
if we make sure all listeners have the proper values there.

tcp_disconnect() was setting snd_cwnd to 2, which seems
quite obsolete since IW10 adoption.

Also remove an obsolete comment.
