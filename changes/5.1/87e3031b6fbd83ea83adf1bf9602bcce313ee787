interconnect: Allow endpoints translation via DT

Currently we support only platform data for specifying the interconnect
endpoints. As now the endpoints are hard-coded into the consumer driver
this may lead to complications when a single driver is used by multiple
SoCs, which may have different interconnect topology.
To avoid cluttering the consumer drivers, introduce a translation function
to help us get the board specific interconnect data from device-tree.
