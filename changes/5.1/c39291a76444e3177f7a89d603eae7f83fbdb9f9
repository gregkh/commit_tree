ASoC: simple-card: cleanup DAI link loop method - step2

Current simple-card is parsing DAI link for both "normal sound" and
"DPCM sound". On this driver, it needs to count and parse
DAIs/Links/Codec Conf from each links.
Then, counting/parsing link loop are very similar, but using different
implementation. Because of this background, the link loop code is very
mysterious. Mystery code will be trouble in the future.

This patch cleanups the code by using asoc_simple_card_for_each_link()
which judges normal link / DPCM link.
