platform/chrome: wilco_ec: Add support for raw commands in debugfs

Add a debugfs attribute that allows sending raw commands to the EC.
This is useful for development and debug but should not be enabled
in a production environment.

To test:
Get the EC firmware build date
First send the request command
> echo 00 f0 38 00 03 00 > raw
Then read the result. "12/21/18" is in the middle of the response
> cat raw
00 31 32 2f 32 31 2f 31 38 00 00 0f 01 00 01 00  .12/21/18.......
