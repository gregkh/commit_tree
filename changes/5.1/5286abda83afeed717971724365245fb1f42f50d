ARM: dts: rockchip: add HCLK_HDMI to rk3066 vio power-domain

A MK808 TV stick with rk3066 processor boots normal with logo
and console, but after booting the monitor remains black.
This patch fixes a vblank wait time out by adding HCLK_HDMI
to the vio power-domain node.

The HCLK_HDMI clock is now part of the logic
that enables the RK3066_PD_VIO power domain.
