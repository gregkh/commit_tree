drm/amd/display: Apply all surface updates onto surfaces

[Why]
Most surface updates weren't propagated onto the surface during
dc_commit_updates_for_stream. This makes it more difficult for DC to
determine the actual surface update type required.

[How]
Use copy_surface_update_to_plane to propagate the changes. The FreeSync
surface timing information update for BTR has been moved out of
amdgpu_dm.c into this function as well.
