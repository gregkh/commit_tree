drm/i915/execlists: Move RCS mmio workaround to new common wa_list

We can move the remaining RCS workarounds applied to only gen8 to the
engine->wa_list, and then reduce all engine->init_hw callbacks to common
code. The benefit of using the new wa_list is that we verify that the
registers are indeed restored and keep their magic values.

v2: INSTPM_FORCE_ORDERING is already part of gen8_ctx_workarounds, and
as confirmed by the mmio verification is a part of the context image!
v3: MI_MODE is already part of gen8_ctx_workarounds...
