batman-adv: Move common genl doit code pre/post hooks

The commit ff4c92d85c6f ("genetlink: introduce pre_doit/post_doit hooks")
intoduced a mechanism to run specific code for doit hooks before/after the
hooks are run. Since all doit hooks are requiring the batadv softif, it
should be retrieved/freed in these helpers to simplify the code.
