s390/cpu_mf: add store cpu counter multiple instruction support

Add support for the STORE CPU COUNTER MULTIPLE instruction to extract
a range of counters from a counter set.

An assembler macro is used to create the instruction opcode because
the counter set identifier is part of the instruction and, thus,
cannot be easily specified as parameter.
