scsi: hisi_sas: Fix losing directly attached disk when hot-plug

Hot-plugging SAS wire of direct hard disk backplane may cause disk lost. We
have done this test with several types of SATA disk from different venders,
and only two models from Seagate has this problem, ST4000NM0035-1V4107 and
ST3000VM002-1ET166.

The root cause is that the disk doesn't send D2H frame after OOB finished.
SAS controller will issue phyup interrupt only when D2H frame is received,
otherwise, will be waiting there all the time.

When this issue happen, we can find the disk again with link reset.  To fix
this issue, we setup an timer after OOB finished. If the PHY is not up in
20s, do link reset. Notes: the 20s is an experience value.
