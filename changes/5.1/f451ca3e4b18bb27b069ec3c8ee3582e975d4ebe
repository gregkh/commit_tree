ARM: davinci: cp-intc: add a wrapper around cp_intc_init()

We're going to extend the cp_intc_init() function with a config
structure so we can drop the intc-related fields from davinci_soc_info.

Once we do it, we won't be able to use this routine directly as the
init_irq callback. Wrap the calls in additional helpers that don't
take parameters and can be assigned to init_irq.
