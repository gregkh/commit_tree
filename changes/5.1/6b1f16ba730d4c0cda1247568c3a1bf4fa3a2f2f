s390/pkey: add one more argument space for debug feature entry

The debug feature entries have been used with up to 5 arguents
(including the pointer to the format string) but there was only
space reserved for 4 arguemnts. So now the registration does
reserve space for 5 times a long value.

This fixes a sometime appearing weired value as the last
value of an debug feature entry like this:

... pkey_sec2protkey zcrypt_send_cprb (cardnr=10 domain=12)
   failed with errno -2143346254
