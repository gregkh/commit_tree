scsi: ufs: Remove select of phy-qcom-ufs from ufs-qcom

CONFIG_SCSI_UFS_QCOM selects CONFIG_PHY_QCOM_UFS, assuming that this was
the only possible PHY driver Qualcomm's UFS controller would use. But in
SDM845, the UFS driver is bundled into phy-qcom-qmp, and phy-qcom-ufs is
unused.

Remove the select, since for SDM845 it adds useless drivers to the build.
