arm64: dts: renesas: r8a7796: salvator-xs: Convert to new LVDS DT bindings

As of commit 6d2ca85279becdff ("dt-bindings: display: renesas: Deprecate
LVDS support in the DU bindings"), the internal LVDS encoder has DT
bindings separate from the DU.  The device trees for all R-Car H3 and
M3-W development boards were ported over to the new model, but
Salvator-XS boards equipped with an R-Car M3-W SoC were forgotten.
