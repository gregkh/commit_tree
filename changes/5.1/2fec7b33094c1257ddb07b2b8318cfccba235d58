Documentation/CodingStyle: Use directory-local variables for emacs settings

In emacs 23.1 support for directory-local variables was added (see also
https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu-emacs/2009-07/msg00000.html).
Simplify the settings in coding-style.rst by using that feature.
Additionally, do not inherit any settings from emacs' linux coding style
to minimize dependencies on the version of emacs that is being used.

I have verified with several large and nontrivial kernel source files
that the new settings format code according to what checkpatch expects.
