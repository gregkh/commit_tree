xprtrdma: Check inline size before providing a Write chunk

In very rare cases, an NFS READ operation might predict that the
non-payload part of the RPC Call is large. For instance, an
NFSv4 COMPOUND with a large GETATTR result, in combination with a
large Kerberos credential, could push the non-payload part to be
several kilobytes.

If the non-payload part is larger than the connection's inline
threshold, the client is required to provision a Reply chunk. The
current Linux client does not check for this case. There are two
obvious ways to handle it:

a. Provision a Write chunk for the payload and a Reply chunk for
   the non-payload part

b. Provision a Reply chunk for the whole RPC Reply

Some testing at a recent NFS bake-a-thon showed that servers can
mostly handle a. but there are some corner cases that do not work
yet. b. already works (it has to, to handle krb5i/p), but could be
somewhat less efficient. However, I expect this scenario to be very
rare -- no-one has reported a problem yet.

So I'm going to implement b. Sometime later I will provide some
patches to help make b. a little more efficient by more carefully
choosing the Reply chunk's segment sizes to ensure the payload is
optimally aligned.
