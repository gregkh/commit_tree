ath10k: update HOST capability qmi message

HOST capability interface data structures are updated
in HL3.1 fw version. Update the qmi host capability
members for compatibility across different firmware
versions.
Since this change breaks backward compatibility with
HL2.0 fw, HL2.0 fw upgrade to WLAN.HL.2.0-01617-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
or later version is required.

Testing:
        Tested on QCS404 platform(WCN3990 HW).
        Tested FW: WLAN.HL.3.1-00784-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1,
                   WLAN.HL.2.0-01617-QCAHLSWMTPLZ-1
