fs: move generic stat response attr handling to vfs_getattr_nosec

generic_fillattr is an optional helper that isn't used by all file
systems, move handling purely based on inode flags to vfs_getattr_nosec,
which is common code.

This fixes setting this flag for file systems not using generic_fillattr
like xfs.
