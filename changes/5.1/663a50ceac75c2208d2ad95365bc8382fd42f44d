drm/i915/gvt: do not let pin count of shadow mm go negative

shadow mm's pin count got increased in workload preparation phase, which
is after workload scanning.
it will get decreased in complete_current_workload() anyway after
workload completion.
Sometimes, if a workload meets a scanning error, its shadow mm pin count
will not get increased but will get decreased in the end.
This patch lets shadow mm's pin count not go below 0.
