drm/amdgpu: Add AMDGPU_CHUNK_ID_SCHEDULED_DEPENDENCIES

New chunk for dependency on start of job's execution instead on
the end. This is used for GPU deadlock prevention when
userspace uses mid-IB fences to wait for mid-IB work on other rings.

v2: Fix typo in AMDGPU_CHUNK_ID_SCHEDULED_DEPENDENCIES
v3: Bump KMS version
v4: put old fence AFTER acquiring the scheduled fence.
