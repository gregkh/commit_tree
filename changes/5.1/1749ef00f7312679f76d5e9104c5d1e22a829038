scsi: core: replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in scsi_scan.c

We had a test-report where, under memory pressure, adding LUNs to the
systems would fail (the tests add LUNs strictly in sequence):

[ 5526.587439] scsi_alloc_sdev: Allocation failure during SCSI scanning, some SCSI devices might not be configured
[ 5526.588562] scsi_alloc_sdev: Allocation failure during SCSI scanning, some SCSI devices might not be configured

Looking at the code of scsi_alloc_sdev(), and all the calling contexts,
there seems to be no reason to use GFP_ATMOIC here. All the different
call-contexts use a mutex at some point, and nothing in between that
requires no sleeping, as far as I could see. Additionally, the code that
later allocates the block queue for the device (scsi_mq_alloc_queue())
already uses GFP_KERNEL.

There are similar allocations in two other functions:
scsi_probe_and_add_lun(), and scsi_add_lun(),; that can also be done with
GFP_KERNEL.

Here is the contexts for the three functions so far:

    scsi_alloc_sdev()
        scsi_probe_and_add_lun()
            scsi_sequential_lun_scan()
                __scsi_scan_target()
                    scsi_scan_target()
                        mutex_lock()
                    scsi_scan_channel()
                        scsi_scan_host_selected()
                            mutex_lock()
            scsi_report_lun_scan()
                __scsi_scan_target()
    	            ...
            __scsi_add_device()
                mutex_lock()
            __scsi_scan_target()
                ...
        scsi_report_lun_scan()
            ...
        scsi_get_host_dev()
            mutex_lock()

    scsi_probe_and_add_lun()
        ...

    scsi_add_lun()
        scsi_probe_and_add_lun()
            ...

So replace all these, and give them a bit of a better chance to succeed,
with more chances of reclaim.
