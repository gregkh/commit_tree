net: split out functions related to registering inflight socket files

We need this functionality for the io_uring file registration, but
we cannot rely on it since CONFIG_UNIX can be modular. Move the helpers
to a separate file, that's always builtin to the kernel if CONFIG_UNIX is
m/y.

No functional changes in this patch, just moving code around.
