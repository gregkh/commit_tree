drm: rockchip: vop: add rk3066 vop definitions

This patch adds the rk3066 VOP definitions.

The VOP or LCD Controller serves as interface between
framebuffer memory and a display device (LCD panel or TV set).

This SOC has two symmetrical LCDC's for a dual panel application.

A LCDC has 5 display layers.
Only 3 are used here.

- Video layer 0 (Win0)
- Video layer 1 (Win1)
- OSD layer     (Win2)

Win0 and Win1 are exchangeable.
Maximum resolution is 1920x1080.

The LCDC0 output is connected to:
- LCDC0 IO (without IOMUX)
- HDMI TX video input

The LCDC1 output is connected to:
- LCDC1 IO (with IOMUX)
- HDMI TX video input

The HDMI TX input can switch between LCDC0 and LCDC1.
