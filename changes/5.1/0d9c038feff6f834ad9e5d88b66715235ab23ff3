zcrypt: handle AP Info notification from CHSC SEI command

The current AP bus implementation periodically polls the AP configuration
to detect changes. When the AP configuration is dynamically changed via the
SE or an SCLP instruction, the changes will not be reflected to sysfs until
the next time the AP configuration is polled. The CHSC architecture
provides a Store Event Information (SEI) command to make notification of an
AP configuration change. This patch introduces a handler to process
notification from the CHSC SEI command by immediately kicking off an AP bus
scan-after-event.
