PCI: pci-bridge-emul: Create per-bridge copy of register behavior

The behavior of the different registers of the PCI-to-PCI bridge is
currently encoded in two global arrays, shared by all instances of
PCI-to-PCI bridge emulation.

However, we will need to tweak the behavior on a per-bridge basis, to
accommodate for different capabilities of the platforms where this
code is used. In preparation for this, create a per-bridge copy of the
register behavior arrays, so that they can later be tweaked on a
per-bridge basis.
