selftests/bpf: fix segfault of test_progs when prog loading failed

The test_progs subtests, test_spin_lock() and test_map_lock(),
requires BTF present to run successfully.
Currently, when BTF failed to load, test_progs will segfault,
  $ ./test_progs
  ...
  12: (bf) r1 = r8
  13: (85) call bpf_spin_lock#93
  map 'hash_map' has to have BTF in order to use bpf_spin_lock

  libbpf: -- END LOG --
  libbpf: failed to load program 'map_lock_demo'
  libbpf: failed to load object './test_map_lock.o'
  test_map_lock:bpf_prog_load errno 13
  Segmentation fault

The segfault is caused by uninitialized variable "obj", which
is used in bpf_object__close(obj), when bpf prog failed to load.

Initializing variable "obj" to NULL in two occasions fixed the problem.
  $ ./test_progs
  ...
  Summary: 219 PASSED, 2 FAILED
