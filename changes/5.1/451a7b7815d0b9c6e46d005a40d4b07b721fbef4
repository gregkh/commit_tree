media: imx: lift CSI and PRP ENC/VF width alignment restriction

The CSI, PRP ENC, and PRP VF subdevices shouldn't have to care about
IDMAC line start address alignment. With compose rectangle support in
the capture driver, they don't have to anymore.
If the direct CSI -> IC path is enabled, the CSI output width must
still be aligned to 8 pixels (IC burst length).
