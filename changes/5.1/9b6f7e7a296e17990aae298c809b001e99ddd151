ALSA: hda: program stripe bits for controller

Platforms having multiple SORs and hdmi/dp sinks require higher
bandwidth to support simultaneous playbacks of higher resolution.
If hda controller supports multiple SDO lines, STRIPE can be used
to indicate how many of the SDO lines the stream should be striped
across.

During stream start stripe control bits are programmed to use given
number of sdo lines and the same is cleared during stream stop.
