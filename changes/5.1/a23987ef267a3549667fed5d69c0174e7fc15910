powerpc: sstep: Add support for darn instruction

This adds emulation support for the following integer instructions:
  * Deliver A Random Number (darn)

As suggested by Michael, this uses a raw .long for specifying the
instruction word when using inline assembly to retain compatibility
with older binutils.
