net/mlx5e: Switch to Toeplitz RSS hash by default

Although XOR hash function can perform very well on some special use
cases, to align with all drivers, mlx5 driver should use Toeplitz hash
by default.
Toeplitz is more stable for the general use case and it is more standard
and reliable.

On top of that, since XOR (MLX5_RX_HASH_FN_INVERTED_XOR8) gives only a
repeated 8 bits pattern. When used for udp tunneling RSS source port
manipulation it results in fixed source port, which will cause bad RSS
spread.
