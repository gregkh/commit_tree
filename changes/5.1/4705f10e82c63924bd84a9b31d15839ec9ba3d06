scsi: qla2xxx: Fix FC-AL connection target discovery

Commit 7f147f9bfd44 ("scsi: qla2xxx: Fix N2N target discovery with Local
loop") fixed N2N target discovery for local loop.  However, same code is
used for FC-AL discovery as well. Added check to make sure we are bypassing
area and domain check only in N2N topology for target discovery.
