arm64: debug: Ensure debug handlers check triggering exception level

Debug exception handlers may be called for exceptions generated both by
user and kernel code. In many cases, this is checked explicitly, but
in other cases things either happen to work by happy accident or they
go slightly wrong. For example, executing 'brk #4' from userspace will
enter the kprobes code and be ignored, but the instruction will be
retried forever in userspace instead of delivering a SIGTRAP.

Fix this issue in the most stable-friendly fashion by simply adding
explicit checks of the triggering exception level to all of our debug
exception handlers.
