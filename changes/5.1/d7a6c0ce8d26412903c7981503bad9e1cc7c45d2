USB: Consolidate LPM checks to avoid enabling LPM twice

USB Bluetooth controller QCA ROME (0cf3:e007) sometimes stops working
after S3:
[ 165.110742] Bluetooth: hci0: using NVM file: qca/nvm_usb_00000302.bin
[ 168.432065] Bluetooth: hci0: Failed to send body at 4 of 1953 (-110)

After some experiments, I found that disabling LPM can workaround the
issue.

On some platforms, the USB power is cut during S3, so the driver uses
reset-resume to resume the device. During port resume, LPM gets enabled
twice, by usb_reset_and_verify_device() and usb_port_resume().

Consolidate all checks into new LPM helpers to make sure LPM only gets
enabled once.
