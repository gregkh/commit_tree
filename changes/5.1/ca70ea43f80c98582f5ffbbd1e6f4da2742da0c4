ARM: 8847/1: pm: fix HYP/SVC mode mismatch when MCPM is used

MCPM does a soft reset of the CPUs and uses common cpu_resume() routine to
perform low-level platform initialization. This results in a try to install
HYP stubs for the second time for each CPU and results in false HYP/SVC
mode mismatch detection. The HYP stubs are already installed at the
beginning of the kernel initialization on the boot CPU (head.S) or in the
secondary_startup() for other CPUs. To fix this issue MCPM code should use
a cpu_resume() routine without HYP stubs installation.

This change fixes HYP/SVC mode mismatch on Samsung Exynos5422-based Odroid
XU3/XU4/HC1 boards.
