btrfs: Refactor shrink_delalloc

Add a couple of comments regarding the logic flow in shrink_delalloc.
Then, cease using max_reclaim as a temporary variable when calculating
nr_pages. Finally give max_reclaim a more becoming name, which
uneqivocally shows at what this variable really holds. No functional
changes.
