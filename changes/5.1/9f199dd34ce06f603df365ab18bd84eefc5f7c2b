irqdomain: Allow the default irq domain to be retrieved

The default irq domain allows legacy code to create irqdomain
mappings without having to track the domain it is allocating
from. Setting the default domain is a one shot, fire and forget
operation, and no effort was made to be able to retrieve this
information at a later point in time.

Newer irqdomain APIs (the hierarchical stuff) relies on both
the irqchip code to track the irqdomain it is allocating from,
as well as some form of firmware abstraction to easily identify
which piece of HW maps to which irq domain (DT, ACPI).

For systems without such firmware (or legacy platform that are
getting dragged into the 21st century), things are a bit harder.
For these cases (and these cases only!), let's provide a way
to retrieve the default domain, allowing the use of the v2 API
without having to resort to platform-specific hacks.
