net: thunderx: raise XDP MTU to 1508

The thunderx driver splits frames bigger than 1530 bytes to multiple
pages, making impossible to run an eBPF program on it.
This leads to a maximum MTU of 1508 if QinQ is in use.

The thunderx driver forbids to load an eBPF program if the MTU is higher
than 1500 bytes. Raise the limit to 1508 so it is possible to use L2
protocols which need some more headroom.
