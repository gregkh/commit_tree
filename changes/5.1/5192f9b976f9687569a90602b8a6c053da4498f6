KVM: x86: Use a u64 when passing the MMIO gen around

KVM currently uses an 'unsigned int' for the MMIO generation number
despite it being derived from the 64-bit memslots generation and
being propagated to (potentially) 64-bit sptes.  There is no hidden
agenda behind using an 'unsigned int', it's done simply because the
MMIO generation will never set bits above bit 19.

Passing a u64 will allow the "update in-progress" flag to be relocated
from bit 0 to bit 63 and removes the need to cast the generation back
to a u64 when propagating it to a spte.
