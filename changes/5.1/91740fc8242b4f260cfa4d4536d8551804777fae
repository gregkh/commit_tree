ARM: imx6q: cpuidle: fix bug that CPU might not wake up at expected time

In the current cpuidle implementation for i.MX6q, the CPU that sets
'WAIT_UNCLOCKED' and the CPU that returns to 'WAIT_CLOCKED' are always
the same. While the CPU that sets 'WAIT_UNCLOCKED' is in IDLE state of
"WAIT", if the other CPU wakes up and enters IDLE state of "WFI"
istead of "WAIT", this CPU can not wake up at expired time.
 Because, in the case of "WFI", the CPU must be waked up by the local
timer interrupt. But, while 'WAIT_UNCLOCKED' is set, the local timer
is stopped, when all CPUs execute "wfi" instruction. As a result, the
local timer interrupt is not fired.
 In this situation, this CPU will wake up by IRQ different from local
timer. (e.g. broacast timer)

So, this fix changes CPU to return to 'WAIT_CLOCKED'.
