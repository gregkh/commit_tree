Input: soc_button_array - add usage-page 0x01 usage-id 0xca mapping

The ACPI0011 _DSD button descriptor on a CHT based Intel Compute Sticks
contains a mapping for usage-page 0x01 usage-id 0xca.

As described in hutrr52_system_display_rotation_lock_controls_0.pdf this
should be mapped as a "System Display Rotation Lock Slider Switch", this
commit adds support for this, silencing the following warning:

soc_button_array ACPI0011:00: Unknown button index 4 upage 01 usage ca,
ignoring
