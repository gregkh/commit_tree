NFS/flexfiles: Avoid unnecessary layout invalidations

In ff_layout_mirror_valid() we may not want to invalidate the layout
segment despite the call to GETDEVICEINFO failing. The reason is that
a read may still be able to make progress on another mirror.

So instead we let the caller (in this case nfs4_ff_layout_prepare_ds())
decide whether or not it needs to invalidate.
