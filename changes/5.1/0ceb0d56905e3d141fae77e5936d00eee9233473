arm64: alternative: Apply alternatives early in boot process

Currently alternatives are applied very late in the boot process (and
a long time after we enable scheduling). Some alternative sequences,
such as those that alter the way CPU context is stored, must be applied
much earlier in the boot sequence.

Introduce apply_boot_alternatives() to allow some alternatives to be
applied immediately after we detect the CPU features of the boot CPU.
