drm/i915/icl: Define MOCS table for Icelake

The table has been unified across OSes to minimize virtualization overhead.

The MOCS table is now published as part of bspec, and versioned. Entries
are supposed to never be modified, but new ones can be added. Adding
entries increases table version. The patch includes version 1 entries.

Meaning of each entry is now explained in bspec, and user mode clients
are expected to know what each entry means. The 3 entries used for previous
platforms are still compatible with their legacy definitions, but that is
not guaranteed to be true for future platforms.

v2: Fixed SCC values, improved commit comment (Daniele)
v3: Improved MOCS table comment (Daniele)
v4: Moved new entries below gen9 ones. Put common entries into
    definition to be used in multiple arrays. (Lucas)
v5: Made defines for or-ing flags. Renamed macros from MOCS_TABLE
    to MOCS_ENTRIES. Switched LE_CoS to upper case. (Joonas)
v6: Removed definitions of reserved entries. (Michal)
    Increased limit of entries sent to the hardware on gen11+.
v7: Simplify table as done for previou gens (Lucas)
v8: Rebase on cached number of entries per-platform and use new
    MOCS_ENTRY() macro (Lucas)
v9: Update comment (from Tomasz)

BSpec: 34007
