fanotify: add support for create/attrib/move/delete events

Add support for events with data type FSNOTIFY_EVENT_INODE
(e.g. create/attrib/move/delete) for inode and filesystem mark types.

The "inode" events do not carry enough information (i.e. path) to
report event->fd, so we do not allow setting a mask for those events
unless group supports reporting fid.

The "inode" events are not supported on a mount mark, because they do
not carry enough information (i.e. path) to be filtered by mount point.

The "dirent" events (create/move/delete) report the fid of the parent
directory where events took place without specifying the filename of the
child. In the future, fanotify may get support for reporting filename
information for those events.
