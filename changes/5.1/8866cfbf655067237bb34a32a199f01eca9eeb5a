media: video-i2c: add Melexis MLX90640 thermal camera

Add initial support for MLX90640 thermal cameras which output an 32x24
greyscale pixel image along with 2 rows of coefficent data.

Because of this the data outputed is really 32x26 and needs the two rows
removed after using the coefficent information to generate processed
images in userspace.
