usb: musb: Kconfig: Drop dependency on CONFIG_USB for jz4740

The Kconfig entry previously depended on USB_OTG_BLACKLIST_HUB
unconditionally, which is an option that is only available when
CONFIG_USB is enabled. However, the USB IP in the JZ4740 SoC does not
support host mode, only gadget mode, so it makes sense to allow it to
build when CONFIG_USB is not set.
