docs: Revamp tainted-kernels.rst to make it more comprehensible

Add a section about decoding /proc/sys/kernel/tainted, create a more
understandable intro and a hopefully explain better the tainted flags in
bugs, oops or panics messages. Only thing missing then is a table that
quickly describes the various bits and taint flags before going into more
detail, so add that as well.

That table is partly based on a section from Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt,
but a bit more compact. To avoid confusion I added the shortened version to
kernel.txt; the same table is used in three different places now:
./tools/debugging/kernel-chktaint,
Documentation/admin-guide/tainted-kernels.rst and
Documentation/sysctl/kernel.txt

During review of v1 (see above) a number of existing issues with the text
were raised, like outdated usages as well as incomplete or missing
descriptions.  Address most of those as well.
