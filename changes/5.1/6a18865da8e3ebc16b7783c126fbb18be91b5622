media: i2c: adv748x: store number of CSI-2 lanes described in device tree

The adv748x CSI-2 transmitters TXA and TXB can use different number of
lanes to transmit data. In order to be able to configure the device
correctly this information need to be parsed from device tree and stored
in each TX private data structure.

TXA supports 1, 2 and 4 lanes while TXB supports 1 lane.
