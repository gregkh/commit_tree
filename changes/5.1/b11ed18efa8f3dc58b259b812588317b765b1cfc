lib/lzo: fix bugs for very short or empty input

For very short input data (0 - 1 bytes), lzo-rle was not behaving
correctly.  Fix this behaviour and update documentation accordingly.

For zero-length input, lzo v0 outputs an end-of-stream marker only,
which was misinterpreted by lzo-rle as a bitstream version number.
Ensure bitstream versions > 0 require a minimum stream length of 5.

Also fixes a bug in handling the tail for very short inputs when a
bitstream version is present.
