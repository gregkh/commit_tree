habanalabs: implement INFO IOCTL

This patch implements the INFO IOCTL. That IOCTL is used by the user to
query information that is relevant/needed by the user in order to submit
deep learning jobs to Goya.

The information is divided into several categories, such as H/W IP, Events
that happened, DDR usage and more.
