bcache: fix input overflow to cache set sysfs file io_error_halflife

Cache set sysfs entry io_error_halflife is used to set c->error_decay.
c->error_decay is in type unsigned int, and it is converted by
strtoul_or_return(), therefore overflow to c->error_decay is possible
for a large input value.

This patch fixes the overflow by using strtoul_safe_clamp() to convert
input string to an unsigned long value in range [0, UINT_MAX], then
divides by 88 and set it to c->error_decay.
