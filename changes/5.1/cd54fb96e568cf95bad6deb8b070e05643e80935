drm/tegra: sor: Parse more data from HDA format

The HDA format data passed to the SOR from the HDA codec contains more
information than just the rate and number of channels. Parse all the
fields and store them in an internal structure for subsequent use.

While at it, also fix an off-by-one error in the number of channels.
