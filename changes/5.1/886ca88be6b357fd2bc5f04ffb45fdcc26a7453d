ACPI / bus: Respect PRP0001 when retrieving device match data

In the PRP0001 case, the compatible string may have additional data
affiliated with the device.  When we call device_get_match_data() on
such device, we will get nothing since currently
acpi_device_get_match_data() doesn't respect PRP0001.

To fix the above, try acpi_of_match_device() if there is no ACPI
table in the driver.

Anyway, note that the device is expected to get its own proper
ACPI ID.
