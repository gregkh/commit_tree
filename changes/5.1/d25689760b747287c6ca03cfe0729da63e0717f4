drm/amdgpu/display: Keep malloc ref to MST port

Just like i915 and nouveau, it's a good idea for us to hold a malloc
reference to the port here so that we never pass a freed pointer to any
of the DP MST helper functions.

Also, we stop unsetting aconnector->port in
dm_dp_destroy_mst_connector(). There's literally no point to that
assignment that I can see anyway.
