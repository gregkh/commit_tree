x86/kvm/mmu: reset MMU context when 32-bit guest switches PAE

Commit 47c42e6b4192 ("KVM: x86: fix handling of role.cr4_pae and rename it
to 'gpte_size'") introduced a regression: 32-bit PAE guests stopped
working. The issue appears to be: when guest switches (enables) PAE we need
to re-initialize MMU context (set context->root_level, do
reset_rsvds_bits_mask(), ...) but init_kvm_tdp_mmu() doesn't do that
because we threw away is_pae(vcpu) flag from mmu role. Restore it to
kvm_mmu_extended_role (as we now don't need it in base role) to fix
the issue.
