power: supply: ds2782: fix possible use-after-free on remove

In remove(), use cancel_delayed_work_sync() to cancel the
delayed work. Otherwise there's a chance that this work
will continue to run until after the device has been removed.

While we're here, fix the deallocation order in remove(),
to correspond to the inverse of the probe() allocation
order. This guarantees that any remaining work can run
to completion with all driver structures still intact.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
