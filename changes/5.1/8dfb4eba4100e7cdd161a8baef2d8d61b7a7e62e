esp4: add length check for UDP encapsulation

esp_output_udp_encap can produce a length that doesn't fit in the 16
bits of a UDP header's length field. In that case, we'll send a
fragmented packet whose length is larger than IP_MAX_MTU (resulting in
"Oversized IP packet" warnings on receive) and with a bogus UDP
length.

To prevent this, add a length check to esp_output_udp_encap and return
 -EMSGSIZE on failure.

This seems to be older than git history.
