libnvdimm/pmem: Honor force_raw for legacy pmem regions

For recovery, where non-dax access is needed to a given physical address
range, and testing, allow the 'force_raw' attribute to override the
default establishment of a dev_pagemap.

Otherwise without this capability it is possible to end up with a
namespace that can not be activated due to corrupted info-block, and one
that can not be repaired due to a section collision.
