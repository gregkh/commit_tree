media: gpu: ipu-v3: Add planar support to interlaced scan

To support interlaced scan with planar formats, cpmem SLUV must
be programmed with the correct chroma line stride. For full and
partial planar 4:2:2 (YUV422P, NV16), chroma line stride must
be doubled. For full and partial planar 4:2:0 (YUV420, YVU420, NV12),
chroma line stride must _not_ be doubled, since a single chroma line
is shared by two luma lines.
