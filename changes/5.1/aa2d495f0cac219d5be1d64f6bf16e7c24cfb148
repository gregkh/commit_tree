HID: Add support for Toshiba WT10A tablet bluetooth keyboard

The bluetooth-keyboard which comes with the Toshiba WT10A tablet uses
a couple of usage codes in the vendor specific ffbc page.

The keyboard has a vendor-id of 04f2 which maps to Chicony.

Other then adding a few keymappings for the ffbc usages, no special
handling is necessary. So rather then adding a new hid-toshiba driver,
this commit adds the ID and 2 extra key-mappings to the hid-topseed
driver. The hid-topseed driver already contains mapping for some
ffbc usages (and does nothing else) and it already binds to another
Chicony manufactured keyboard.
