drm/i915/params: set i915.enable_hangcheck permissions to 0600

i915.enable_hangcheck has been an outlier since its introduction in
commit 3e0dc6b01f53 ("drm/i915: hangcheck disable parameter") with 0644
permissions, while all the rest are either 0400 or 0600. Follow suit
with 0600.

IGT never reads the value, so there should be no impact.
