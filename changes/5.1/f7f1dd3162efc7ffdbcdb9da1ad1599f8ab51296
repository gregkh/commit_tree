afs: Check for rxrpc call completion in wait loop

Check the state of the rxrpc call backing an afs call in each iteration of
the call wait loop in case the rxrpc call has already been terminated at
the rxrpc layer.

Interrupt the wait loop and mark the afs call as complete if the rxrpc
layer call is complete.

There were cases where rxrpc errors were not passed up to afs, which could
result in this loop waiting forever for an afs call to transition to
AFS_CALL_COMPLETE while the rx call was already complete.
