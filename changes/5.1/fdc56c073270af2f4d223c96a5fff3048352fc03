PM-runtime: Consolidate code to get active/suspended time

In a step to consolidate the code for fetching the PM-runtime
active/suspended time for a device, add a common function for that
and make the existing pm_runtime_suspended_time() call it.

Also add a corresponding pm_runtime_active_time() calling the new
common function.
