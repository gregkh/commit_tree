bcache: not use hard coded memset size in bch_cache_accounting_clear()

In stats.c:bch_cache_accounting_clear(), a hard coded number '7' is
used in memset(). It is because in struct cache_stats, there are 7
atomic_t type members. This is not good when new members added into
struct stats, the hard coded number will only clear part of memory.

This patch replaces 'sizeof(unsigned long) * 7' by more generic
'sizeof(struct cache_stats))', to avoid potential error if new
member added into struct cache_stats.
