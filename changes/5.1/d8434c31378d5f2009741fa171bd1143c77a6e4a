i2c: core-smbus: don't trace smbus_reply data on errors

If an smbus transfer fails, there's no guarantee that the output
buffer was written.  So, avoid trying to show the output buffer when
tracing after an error.  This was 'mostly harmless', but would trip
up kasan checking if left-over cruft in byte 0 is a large length,
causing us to read from unwritten memory.
