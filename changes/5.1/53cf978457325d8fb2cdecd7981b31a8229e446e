jbd2: fix deadlock while checkpoint thread waits commit thread to finish

This issue was found when I tried to put checkpoint work in a separate thread,
the deadlock below happened:
         Thread1                                |   Thread2
__jbd2_log_wait_for_space                       |
jbd2_log_do_checkpoint (hold j_checkpoint_mutex)|
  if (jh->b_transaction != NULL)                |
    ...                                         |
    jbd2_log_start_commit(journal, tid);        |jbd2_update_log_tail
                                                |  will lock j_checkpoint_mutex,
                                                |  but will be blocked here.
                                                |
    jbd2_log_wait_commit(journal, tid);         |
    wait_event(journal->j_wait_done_commit,     |
     !tid_gt(tid, journal->j_commit_sequence)); |
     ...                                        |wake_up(j_wait_done_commit)
  }                                             |

then deadlock occurs, Thread1 will never be waken up.

To fix this issue, drop j_checkpoint_mutex in jbd2_log_do_checkpoint()
when we are going to wait for transaction commit.
