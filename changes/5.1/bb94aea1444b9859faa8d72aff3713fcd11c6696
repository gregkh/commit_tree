blk-mq: save default hctx into ctx->hctxs for not-supported type

Currently, we check whether the hctx type is supported every time
in hot path. Actually, this is not necessary, we could save the
default hctx into ctx->hctxs if the type is not supported when
map swqueues and use it directly with ctx->hctxs[type].

We also needn't check whether the poll is enabled or not, because
the caller would clear the REQ_HIPRI in that case.
