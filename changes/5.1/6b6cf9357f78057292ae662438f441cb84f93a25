IB/hfi1: Set PbcInsertHcrc for TID RDMA packets

All TID RDMA packets are in KDETH packet format and therefore the
PbcInsertHcrc must be set properly before sending the packet to
hardware. Otherwise, the packets will be dropped by the receiver.
By default, HCRC is not inserted for 9B packets without KDETH, and
this patch adds that back for TID RDMA packets.
