rds: ib: force endiannes annotation

While the endiannes is being handled correctly as indicated by the comment
above the offending line - sparse was unhappy with the missing annotation
as be64_to_cpu() expects a __be64 argument. To mitigate this annotation
all involved variables are changed to a consistent __le64 and the
 conversion to uint64_t delayed to the call to rds_cong_map_updated().
