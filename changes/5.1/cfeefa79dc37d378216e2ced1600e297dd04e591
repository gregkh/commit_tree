spi: cadence: Convert to use CS GPIO descriptors

This converts the Cadence SPI master driver to use GPIO
descriptors for chip select handling.

The Cadence driver was allocating a state container just
to hold the requested GPIO line and contained lots of
polarity inversion code. As this is all handled by gpiolib
and a simple devm_* request in the core, and as the driver
is fully device tree only, most of this code chunk goes
away in favour of central handling. The setup/cleanup
callbacks goes away.

This driver does NOT drive the CS line by setting the
value of the GPIO so it relies on the SPI core to do
this, which should work just fine with the descriptors.
