percpu: use nr_groups as check condition

group_cnt array is defined with NR_CPUS entries, but normally
nr_groups will not reach up to NR_CPUS. So there is no issue
to the current code.

Checking other parts of pcpu_build_alloc_info, use nr_groups as
check condition, so make it consistent to use 'group < nr_groups'
as for loop check. In case we do have nr_groups equals with NR_CPUS,
we could also avoid memory access out of bounds.
