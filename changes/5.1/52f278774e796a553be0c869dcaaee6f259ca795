bpf: implement BPF_LWT_ENCAP_IP mode in bpf_lwt_push_encap

Implement BPF_LWT_ENCAP_IP mode in bpf_lwt_push_encap BPF helper.
It enables BPF programs (specifically, BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_IN and
BPF_PROG_TYPE_LWT_XMIT prog types) to add IP encapsulation headers
to packets (e.g. IP/GRE, GUE, IPIP).

This is useful when thousands of different short-lived flows should be
encapped, each with different and dynamically determined destination.
Although lwtunnels can be used in some of these scenarios, the ability
to dynamically generate encap headers adds more flexibility, e.g.
when routing depends on the state of the host (reflected in global bpf
maps).

v7 changes:
 - added a call skb_clear_hash();
 - removed calls to skb_set_transport_header();
 - refuse to encap GSO-enabled packets.

v8 changes:
 - fix build errors when LWT is not enabled.

Note: the next patch in the patchset with deal with GSO-enabled packets,
which are currently rejected at encapping attempt.
