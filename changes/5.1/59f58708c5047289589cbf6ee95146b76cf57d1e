e1000e: Exclude device from suspend direct complete optimization

e1000e sets different WoL settings in system suspend callback and
runtime suspend callback.

The suspend direct complete optimization leaves e1000e in runtime
suspended state with wrong WoL setting during system suspend.

To fix this, we need to disable suspend direct complete optimization to
let e1000e always use suspend callback to set correct WoL during system
suspend.
