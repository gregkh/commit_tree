ARM: dts: exynos: Fix conflicting fixed-regulator GPIO flags and properties

Bindings of the fixed-regulator, which precedes support for GPIO flags
passed via phandle descriptor, introduced its own method annotating
that the given GPIO line is active low or high - by using
'enable-active-high' property. The driver always ignored flags passed
via GPIO descriptor.

Fix the conflicting GPIO flags to match the status forced by the
'enable-active-high' property to avoid future confusion.
