net/smc: reduce amount of status updates to peer

In smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() the received cdc message is evaluated.
To reduce the number of messaged triggered by this evaluation the logic
is streamlined. For the write_blocked condition we do not need to send
a response immediately. The remaining conditions can be put together
into one if clause.
