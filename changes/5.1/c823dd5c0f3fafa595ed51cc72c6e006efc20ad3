KVM: VMX: Fold __vmx_vcpu_run() back into vmx_vcpu_run()

...now that the code is no longer tagged with STACK_FRAME_NON_STANDARD.
Arguably, providing __vmx_vcpu_run() to break up vmx_vcpu_run() is
valuable on its own, but the previous split was purposely made as small
as possible to limit the effects STACK_FRAME_NON_STANDARD.  In other
words, the current split is now completely arbitrary and likely not the
most logical.

This also allows renaming ____vmx_vcpu_run() to __vmx_vcpu_run() in a
future patch.
