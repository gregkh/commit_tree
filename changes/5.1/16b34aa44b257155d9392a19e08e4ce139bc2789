cifs: prevent starvation in wait_for_free_credits for multi-credit requests

Reserve the last MAX_COMPOUND credits for any request asking for >1 credit.
This is to prevent future compound requests from becoming starved while waiting
for potentially many requests is there is a large number of concurrent
singe-credit requests.

However, we need to protect from servers that are very slow to hand out
new credits on new sessions so we only do this IFF there are 2*MAX_COMPOUND
(arbitrary) credits already in flight.
