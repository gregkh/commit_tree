ARM: orion: don't use using 64-bit DMA masks

clang warns about statically defined DMA masks from the DMA_BIT_MASK
macro with length 64:

arch/arm/plat-orion/common.c:625:29: error: shift count >= width of type [-Werror,-Wshift-count-overflow]
                .coherent_dma_mask      = DMA_BIT_MASK(64),
                                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
include/linux/dma-mapping.h:141:54: note: expanded from macro 'DMA_BIT_MASK'
 #define DMA_BIT_MASK(n) (((n) == 64) ? ~0ULL : ((1ULL<<(n))-1))

The ones in orion shouldn't really be 64 bit masks, so changing them
to what the driver can support avoids the warning.
