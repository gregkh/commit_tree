bpf: verifier: remove dead code

Instead of overwriting dead code with jmp -1 instructions
remove it completely for root.  Adjust verifier state and
line info appropriately.

v2:
 - adjust func_info (Alexei);
 - make sure first instruction retains line info (Alexei).
v4: (Yonghong)
 - remove unnecessary if (!insn to remove) checks;
 - always keep last line info if first live instruction lacks one.
v5: (Martin Lau)
 - improve and clarify comments.
