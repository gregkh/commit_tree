tpm: Simplify the measurements loop

The responsibility of tpm1_bios_measurements_start() is to walk over the
first *pos measurements, ensuring the skipped and to-be-read
measurements are not out-of-boundary.

This commit simplifies the loop by employing a do-while loop with
the necessary sanity check.
