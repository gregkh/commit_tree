batman-adv: Snoop DHCPACKs for DAT

In a 1000 nodes mesh network (Freifunk Hamburg) we can still see
30KBit/s of ARP traffic (equalling about 25% of all layer two
specific overhead, remaining after some filtering) flooded through
the mesh. These 30KBit/s are mainly ARP Requests from the
gateways / DHCP servers.

By snooping DHCPACKs we can learn about MAC/IP address pairs
in the DHCP range without relying on ARP. This patch is in preparation
to eliminate the need for mesh wide message flooding for IPv4 address
resolution.

Also this allows to quickly update a MAC/IP pair at least in the DHT when
DHCP reassigns an IP address to a new host.
