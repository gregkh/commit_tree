ACPI / APEI: Move NOTIFY_SEA between the estatus-queue and NOTIFY_NMI

The estatus-queue code is currently hidden by the NOTIFY_NMI #ifdefs.
Once NOTIFY_SEA starts using the estatus-queue we can stop hiding
it as each architecture has a user that can't be turned off.

Split the existing CONFIG_HAVE_ACPI_APEI_NMI block in two, and move
the SEA code into the gap.

Move the code around ... and changes the stale comment describing
why the status queue is necessary: printk() is no longer the issue,
its the helpers like memory_failure_queue() that aren't nmi safe.
