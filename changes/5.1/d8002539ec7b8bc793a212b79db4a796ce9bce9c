ALSA: fireface: comment cleanup about destination address of async transactions for MIDI messages

In Fireface series, registration of higher 4 bytes of destination
address for asynchronous transaction of MIDI messages is done by
a write transaction to model-specific register.

On the other hand, registration of lower 4 bytes of the address is
selectable from 4 options. A register for this registration includes
the other purpose options such as input attenuation. Thus this
driver expects userspace applications to configure the register.

Actual behaviour for the asynchronous transaction is different
depending on protocols. In former protocol, destination offset
of each transaction is the same as the registered address even if
it is block request. In latter models, destination offset of each
transaction is the offset of previous transaction plus 4 byte
and the transaction is quadlet request.

This commit cleanups comments about the above mechanism.
