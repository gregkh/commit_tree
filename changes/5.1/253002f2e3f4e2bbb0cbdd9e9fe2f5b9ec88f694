Btrfs: remove assertion when searching for a key in a node/leaf

At ctree.c:key_search(), the assertion that verifies the first key on a
child extent buffer corresponds to the key at a specific slot in the
parent has a disadvantage: we effectively hit a BUG_ON() which requires
rebooting the machine later. It also does not tell any information about
which extent buffer is affected, from which root, the expected and found
keys, etc.

However as of commit 581c1760415c48 ("btrfs: Validate child tree block's
level and first key"), that assertion is not needed since at the time we
read an extent buffer from disk we validate that its first key matches the
key, at the respective slot, in the parent extent buffer. Therefore just
remove the assertion at key_search().
