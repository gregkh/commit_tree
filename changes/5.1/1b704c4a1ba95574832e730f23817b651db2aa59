hv_netvsc: Fix unwanted wakeup after tx_disable

After queue stopped, the wakeup mechanism may wake it up again
when ring buffer usage is lower than a threshold. This may cause
send path panic on NULL pointer when we stopped all tx queues in
netvsc_detach and start removing the netvsc device.

This patch fix it by adding a tx_disable flag to prevent unwanted
queue wakeup.
