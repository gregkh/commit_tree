fs: add fget_many() and fput_many()

Some uses cases repeatedly get and put references to the same file, but
the only exposed interface is doing these one at the time. As each of
these entail an atomic inc or dec on a shared structure, that cost can
add up.

Add fget_many(), which works just like fget(), except it takes an
argument for how many references to get on the file. Ditto fput_many(),
which can drop an arbitrary number of references to a file.
