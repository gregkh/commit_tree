perf tools: Add cpu_topology object

Make struct cpu_topo global and rename it to 'struct cpu_topology', so
that it can be used from the 'perf record' command in the following
patches.

Add the following interface functions to load/free cpu topology details:

  struct cpu_topology *cpu_topology__new(void);
  void cpu_topology__delete(struct cpu_topology *tp);

Move it to a separate source file cputopo.c together with numa related
object in the following patches.

No functional change, the new interface will be used in upcoming changes.
