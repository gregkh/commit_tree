arm/arm64: KVM: Statically configure the host's view of MPIDR

We currently eagerly save/restore MPIDR. It turns out to be
slightly pointless:
- On the host, this value is known as soon as we're scheduled on a
  physical CPU
- In the guest, this value cannot change, as it is set by KVM
  (and this is a read-only register)

The result of the above is that we can perfectly avoid the eager
saving of MPIDR_EL1, and only keep the restore. We just have
to setup the host contexts appropriately at boot time.
