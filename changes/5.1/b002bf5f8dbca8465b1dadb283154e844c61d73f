iio: adc: meson-saradc: enable the temperature sensor two more SoCs

Meson8b and Meson8m2 use the same logic to convert the ADC register
value to celsius, which is different from Meson8:
- Meson8 has different multiplier and divider values
- Meson8 uses a 4-bit TSC (temperature sensor coefficient) which fits
  into the 4-bit field in the MESON_SAR_ADC_DELTA_10 register:
  MESON_SAR_ADC_DELTA_10_TS_C_MASK. Meson8b and Meson8m2 have a 5-bit
  TSC which requires writing the upper-most bit into the
  MESON_HHI_DPLL_TOP_0[9] register from the HHI register area.

This adds support for the temperature sensor on the Meson8b and Meson8m2
SoCs by implementing the logic to write the upper-most TSC bit into the
HHI register area. The SoC-specific values (temperature_trimming_bits,
temperature_multiplier, temperature_divider) are added - these simply
integrate into the existing infrastructure (which was implemented for
Meson8) and thus require no further changes to the existing temperature
calculation logic.
