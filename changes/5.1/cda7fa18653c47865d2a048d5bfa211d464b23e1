scsi: lpfc: Correct __lpfc_sli_issue_iocb_s4 lockdep check

The outer routine lpfc_sli_issue_iocb(), which decomposes into the
SLI3 (s3) or SLI4 (s4) subroutines takes out the locks. For s3, it takes
out the hbalock. For s4, it takes out the ring_lock. The lockdep check in
the s3 and s4 subroutines both check hbalock, which is incorrect for s4.

Revise the s4 subroutine to lockdep check the ring_lock.
