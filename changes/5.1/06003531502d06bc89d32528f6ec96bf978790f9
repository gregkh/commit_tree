iio: dac: mcp4725: add missing powerdown bits in store eeprom

When issuing the write DAC register and write eeprom command, the two
powerdown bits (PD0 and PD1) are assumed by the chip to be present in
the bytes sent. Leaving them at 0 implies "powerdown disabled" which is
a different state that the current one. By adding the current state of
the powerdown in the i2c write, the chip will correctly power-on exactly
like as it is at the moment of store_eeprom call.

This is documented in MCP4725's datasheet, FIGURE 6-2: "Write Commands
for DAC Input Register and EEPROM" and MCP4726's datasheet, FIGURE 6-3:
"Write All Memory Command".
