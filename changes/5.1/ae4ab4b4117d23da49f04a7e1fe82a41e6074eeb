btf: expose API to work with raw btf_ext data

This patch changes struct btf_ext to retain original data in sequential
block of memory, which makes it possible to expose
btf_ext__get_raw_data() interface similar to btf__get_raw_data(), allowing
users of libbpf to get access to raw representation of .BTF.ext section.
