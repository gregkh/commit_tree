cfg80211: Notify previous user request during self managed wiphy registration

Commit c82c06ce43d3("cfg80211: Notify all User Hints To self managed wiphys")
notified all new user hints to self managed wiphy's after device registration.
But it didn't do this for anything other than cell base hints done before
registration.

This needs to be done during wiphy registration of a self managed device also,
so that the previous user settings are retained.
