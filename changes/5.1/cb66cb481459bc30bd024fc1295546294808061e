MAINTAINERS: fix GTA02 entry and mark as orphan

The entry for GTA02 never had paths listed; fix that.  commit 9d76295ac608
("[ARM] GTA02/FreeRunner: Add machine definition"), which added the entry
for GTA02, created two new files named
arch/arm/mach-s3c2442/{include/mach/gta02.h,mach-gta02.c}, which were then
renamed in commit dd6f01b5ccba ("ARM: S3C2440: move mach-s3c2440/* into
mach-s3c24xx/") to
arch/arm/mach-s3c24xx/{include/mach/gta02.h,mach-gta02.c}.

Also, the GTA02 maintainer's email address is from a domain that doesn't
have an MX record anymore and appears to have expired.  Remove the
maintainer and mark the subsystem as orphan.
