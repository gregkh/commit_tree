tpm: remove @space from tpm_transmit()

Remove @space from tpm_transmit() API` in order to completely remove the
bound between low-level transmission functionality and TPM spaces. The
only real dependency existing is the amount of data saved before trying
to send a command to the TPM.

It doesn't really matter if we save always a bit more than needed so
this commit changes the amount saved always to be the size of the TPM
header and three handles.
