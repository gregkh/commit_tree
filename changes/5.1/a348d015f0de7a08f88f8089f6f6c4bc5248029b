PCI: dwc: Improve code readability and simplify mask/unmask operations

Improve code readability and simplifies mask/unmask operations by
inverting the applied logic (no functional change is intended).

Replace variable name from irq_status to irq_mask, since its goal is to
keep track of which interrupts are masked or not.
