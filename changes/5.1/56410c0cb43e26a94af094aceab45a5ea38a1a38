hwrng: optee: Initialize some structs using memset instead of braces

Clang warns:

One way to fix these warnings is to add additional braces like Clang
suggests; however, there has been a bit of push back from some
maintainers, who just prefer memset as it is unambiguous, doesn't
depend on a particular compiler version, and properly initializes all
subobjects [1][2]. Do that here so there are no more warnings.
