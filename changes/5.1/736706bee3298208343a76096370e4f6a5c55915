get rid of legacy 'get_ds()' function

Every in-kernel use of this function defined it to KERNEL_DS (either as
an actual define, or as an inline function).  It's an entirely
historical artifact, and long long long ago used to actually read the
segment selector valueof '%ds' on x86.

Which in the kernel is always KERNEL_DS.

Inspired by a patch from Jann Horn that just did this for a very small
subset of users (the ones in fs/), along with Al who suggested a script.
I then just took it to the logical extreme and removed all the remaining
gunk.

Roughly scripted with

   git grep -l '(get_ds())' -- :^tools/ | xargs sed -i 's/(get_ds())/(KERNEL_DS)/'
   git grep -lw 'get_ds' -- :^tools/ | xargs sed -i '/^#define get_ds()/d'

plus manual fixups to remove a few unusual usage patterns, the couple of
inline function cases and to fix up a comment that had become stale.

The 'get_ds()' function remains in an x86 kvm selftest, since in user
space it actually does something relevant.
