xfs: split up allocation btree verifier

Similar to the inode btree verifier, the same allocation btree
verifier structure is shared between the by-bno (bnobt) and by-size
(cntbt) btrees. This prevents the ability to distinguish magic
values between them. Separate the verifier into two, one for each
tree, and assign them appropriately. No functional changes.
