xfs: factor xfs_da3_blkinfo verification into common helper

With the verifier magic value helper in place, we've left a bit more
duplicate code across the verifiers that involve struct
xfs_da3_blkinfo. This includes the da node, xattr leaf and dir leaf
verifiers, all of which perform similar checks for v4 and v5
filesystems.

Create a common helper to verify an xfs_da3_blkinfo structure,
taking care to only access v5 fields where appropriate, and refactor
the aforementioned verifiers to use the helper. No functional
changes.
