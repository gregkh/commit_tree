hwrng: Fix unsigned comparison with less than zero

The return from the call to tee_client_invoke_func can be a
negative error code however this is being assigned to an
unsigned variable 'ret' hence the check is always false.
Fix this by making 'ret' an int.

Detected by Coccinelle ("Unsigned expression compared with zero:
ret < 0")
