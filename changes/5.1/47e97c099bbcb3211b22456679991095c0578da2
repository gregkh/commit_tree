KVM: VMX: Load/save guest CR2 via C code in __vmx_vcpu_run()

...to eliminate its parameter and struct vcpu_vmx offset definition
from the assembly blob.  Accessing CR2 from C versus assembly doesn't
change the likelihood of taking a page fault (and modifying CR2) while
it's loaded with the guest's value, so long as we don't do anything
silly between accessing CR2 and VM-Enter/VM-Exit.
