irqchip/sifive-plic: Differentiate between PLIC handler and context

We explicitly differentiate between PLIC handler and context because
PLIC context is for given mode of HART whereas PLIC handler is per-CPU
software construct meant for handling interrupts from a particular
PLIC context.

To achieve this differentiation, we rename "nr_handlers" to "nr_contexts"
and "nr_mapped" to "nr_handlers" in plic_init().
