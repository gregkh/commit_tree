ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Add quirk for PoV TAB-P1006W-232 (v1.0) tablet

Add a DMI quirk for the Point of View TAB-P1006W-232 (v1.0) tablet, this
tablet is special in a number of ways:

1) It uses the 2nd GPIO resource in the ACPI tables for jack-detect rather
then using the rt5651 codec's builtin jack-detect functionality

2) It uses the 3th GPIO resource in the ACPI tables to control the
external amplifier rather then the usual first non GpioInt resource and
the GPIO is active-low.

3) It is a BYTCR device, without a CHAN package and it uses SSP0-AIF1
rather then the default SSP0-AIF2.

4) Its internal mic is a digital mic (the first x86 rt5651 device that
I'm aware of which does this), combined with having its headset-mic
connected to IN2.
