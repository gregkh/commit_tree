ACPI / APEI: Use separate fixmap pages for arm64 NMI-like notifications

Now that ghes notification helpers provide the fixmap slots and
take the lock themselves, multiple NMI-like notifications can
be used on arm64.

These should be named after their notification method as they can't
all be called 'NMI'. x86's NOTIFY_NMI already is, change the SEA
fixmap entry to be called FIX_APEI_GHES_SEA.

Future patches can add support for FIX_APEI_GHES_SEI and
FIX_APEI_GHES_SDEI_{NORMAL,CRITICAL}.

Because all of ghes.c builds on both architectures, provide a
constant for each fixmap entry that the architecture will never
use.
