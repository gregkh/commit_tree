ARCv2: boot log: refurbish HS core/release identification

HS core names and releases have so far been identified based solely on
IDENTIFY.ARCVER field. With the future HS releases this will not
be sufficient as same ARCVER 0x54 could be an HS38 or HS48.

So rewrite the code to use a new BCR to identify the cores properly.
