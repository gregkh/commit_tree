drm/i915/dsi: Enable dithering for 6 bpc panels

The display engine has 2 dithering enable bits which both need to be set
for dithering to happen, 1 in the PIPECONF register which is taken care of
by i9xx_set_pipeconf() and a second bit at the encoder level.

The dsi code was not setting the encoder level dithering enable bit causing
dithering to be disabled, this commit fixes this.
