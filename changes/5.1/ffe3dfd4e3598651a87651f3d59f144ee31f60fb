powerpc/dma: stop overriding dma_get_required_mask

The ppc_md and pci_controller_ops methods are unused now and can be
removed.  The dma_nommu implementation is generic to the generic one
except for using max_pfn instead of calling into the memblock API,
and all other dma_map_ops instances implement a method of their own.
