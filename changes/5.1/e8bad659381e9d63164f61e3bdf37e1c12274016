gpu: host1x: Cancel only job that actually got stuck

Host1x doesn't have information about jobs inter-dependency, that is
something that will become available once host1x will get a proper
jobs scheduler implementation. Currently a hang job causes other unrelated
jobs to be canceled, that is a relic from downstream driver which is
irrelevant to upstream. Let's cancel only the hanging job and not to touch
other jobs in queue.
