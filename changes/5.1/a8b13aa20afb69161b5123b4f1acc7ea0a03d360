fanotify: enable FAN_REPORT_FID init flag

When setting up an fanotify listener, user may request to get fid
information in event instead of an open file descriptor.

The fid obtained with event on a watched object contains the file
handle returned by name_to_handle_at(2) and fsid returned by statfs(2).

Restrict FAN_REPORT_FID to class FAN_CLASS_NOTIF, because we have have
no good reason to support reporting fid on permission events.

When setting a mark, we need to make sure that the filesystem
supports encoding file handles with name_to_handle_at(2) and that
statfs(2) encodes a non-zero fsid.
