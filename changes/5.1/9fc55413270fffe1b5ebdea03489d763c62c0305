net: hns3: fix improper error handling in the hclge_init_ae_dev()

While hclge_init_umv_space() failed in the hclge_init_ae_dev(),
we should undo all the operation which has been done successfully,
the last success operation maybe hclge_mac_mdio_config(), so if
hclge_init_umv_space() failed, we also need to undo it.
