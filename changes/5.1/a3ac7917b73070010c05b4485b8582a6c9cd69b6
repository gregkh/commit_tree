Revert "parport: daisy: use new parport device model"

This reverts commit 1aec4211204d9463d1fd209eb50453de16254599.

Steven Rostedt reports that it causes a hang at bootup and bisected it
to this commit.

The troigger is apparently a module alias for "parport_lowlevel" that
points to "parport_pc", which causes a hang with

    modprobe -q -- parport_lowlevel

blocking forever with a backtrace like this:

Supid says:
 "Due to the new device model daisy driver will now try to find the
  parallel ports while trying to register its driver so that it can bind
  with them. Now, since daisy driver is loaded while parport bus is
  initialising the list of parport is still empty and it tries to load
  the lowlevel driver, which has an alias set to parport_pc, now causes
  a deadlock"

But I don't think the daisy driver should be loaded by the parport
initialization in the first place, so let's revert the whole change.

If the daisy driver can just initialize separately on its own (like a
driver should), instead of hooking into the parport init sequence
directly, this issue probably would go away.
