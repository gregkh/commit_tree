percpu: stop printing kernel addresses

Since commit ad67b74d2469d9b8 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p"),
at boot "____ptrval____" is printed instead of actual addresses:

    percpu: Embedded 38 pages/cpu @(____ptrval____) s124376 r0 d31272 u524288

Instead of changing the print to "%px", and leaking kernel addresses,
just remove the print completely, cfr. e.g. commit 071929dbdd865f77
("arm64: Stop printing the virtual memory layout").
