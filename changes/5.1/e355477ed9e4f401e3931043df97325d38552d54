net/mlx5: Make mlx5_cmd_exec_cb() a safe API

APIs that have deferred callbacks should have some kind of cleanup
function that callers can use to fence the callbacks. Otherwise things
like module unloading can lead to dangling function pointers, or worse.

The IB MR code is the only place that calls this function and had a
really poor attempt at creating this fence. Provide a good version in
the core code as future patches will add more places that need this
fence.
