misc/mei/hdcp: Enabling the HDCP authentication

Request to ME to configure a port as authenticated.

On Success, ME FW will mark the port as authenticated and provides
HDCP cipher with the encryption keys.

Enabling the Authentication can be requested once all stages of
HDCP2.2 authentication is completed by interacting with ME FW.

Only after this stage, driver can enable the HDCP encryption for
the port, through HW registers.
