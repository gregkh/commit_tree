PCI: Fix "try" semantics of bus and slot reset

The commit referenced below introduced device locking around save and
restore of state for each device during a PCI bus "try" reset, making it
decidely non-"try" and prone to deadlock in the event that a device is
already locked.  Restore __pci_reset_bus() and __pci_reset_slot() to their
advertised locking semantics by pushing the save and restore functions into
the branch where the entire tree is already locked.  Extend the helper
function names with "_locked" and update the comment to reflect this
calling requirement.
