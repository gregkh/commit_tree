batman-adv: Add aggregated_ogms mesh genl configuration

The mesh interface can delay OGM messages to aggregate different ogms
together in a single OGM packet.

The BATADV_CMD_SET_MESH/BATADV_CMD_GET_MESH commands allow to set/get the
configuration of this feature using the BATADV_ATTR_AGGREGATED_OGMS_ENABLED
attribute. Setting the u8 to zero will disable this feature and setting it
to something else is enabling this feature.
