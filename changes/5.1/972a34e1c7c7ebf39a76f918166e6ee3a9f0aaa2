usb: ehci: fsl: Update register accessing for arm/arm64 platforms

arm/arm64's io.h doesn't define clrbits32() and clrsetbits_be32(), which
causing compile failure on some Layerscape Platforms (such as LS1021A and
LS2012A which also integrates FSL EHCI controller). So use
ioread32be()/iowrite32be() instead to make it workable on both
powerpc and arm.
