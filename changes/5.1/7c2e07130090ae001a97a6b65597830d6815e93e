clk: x86: Add system specific quirk to mark clocks as critical

Since commit 648e921888ad ("clk: x86: Stop marking clocks as
CLK_IS_CRITICAL"), the pmc_plt_clocks of the Bay Trail SoC are
unconditionally gated off. Unfortunately this will break systems where these
clocks are used for external purposes beyond the kernel's knowledge. Fix it
by implementing a system specific quirk to mark the necessary pmc_plt_clks as
critical.
