socket: Use old_timeval types for socket timestamps

As part of y2038 solution, all internal uses of
struct timeval are replaced by struct __kernel_old_timeval
and struct compat_timeval by struct old_timeval32.
Make socket timestamps use these new types.

This is mainly to be able to verify that the kernel build
is y2038 safe when such non y2038 safe types are not
supported anymore.
