drm/i915: Use drm_hdmi_avi_infoframe_quant_range() for SDVO HDMI as well

Fill out the AVI infoframe quantization range bits using
drm_hdmi_avi_infoframe_quant_range() for SDVO HDMI encoder as well.

This changes the behaviour slightly as
drm_hdmi_avi_infoframe_quant_range() will set a non-zero Q bit
even when QS==0 iff the Q bit matched the default quantization
range for the given mode. This matches the recommendation in
HDMI 2.0 and is allowed even before that.
