gpio: zynq: properly support runtime PM for GPIO used as interrupts

The Zynq GPIO driver currently implements runtime PM by:

 - Enabling runtime PM support in ->probe() and letting the runtime PM
   reference counter drop to zero at the end of ->probe().

 - Increasing the runtime PM reference counter in ->request() and
   decreasing it in ->free().

However, the latter is not sufficient: when a GPIO is used as an
interrupt, ->request() and ->free() are not called. Due to this, the
runtime PM counter remains to zero when the only GPIOs in use are used
as interrupts, causing them to simply not work.

To address this problem, this commit implement the
->irq_request_resources() and ->irq_release_resources() hooks,
ensuring that the runtime PM counter is properly
incremented/decremented. Since we override the default hooks, we keep
the existing behavior by making sure they call gpiochip_reqres_irq() /
gpiochip_relres_irq() respectively.
