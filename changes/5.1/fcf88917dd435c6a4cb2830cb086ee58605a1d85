slab: fix a crash by reading /proc/slab_allocators

The commit 510ded33e075 ("slab: implement slab_root_caches list")
changes the name of the list node within "struct kmem_cache" from "list"
to "root_caches_node", but leaks_show() still use the "list" which
causes a crash when reading /proc/slab_allocators.

You need to have CONFIG_SLAB=y and CONFIG_MEMCG=y to see the problem,
because without MEMCG all slab caches are root caches, and the "list"
node happens to be the right one.
