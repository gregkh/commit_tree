drm/nouveau: Remove unnecessary VCPI checks in nv50_msto_cleanup()

There is no need to look at the port's VCPI allocation before calling
drm_dp_mst_deallocate_vcpi(), as we already have msto->disabled to let
us avoid cleaning up an msto more then once. The DP MST core will never
call drm_dp_mst_deallocate_vcpi() on it's own, which is presumably what
these checks are meant to protect against.

More importantly though, we're about to stop clearing mstc->port in the
next commit, which means if we could potentially hit a use-after-free
error if we tried to check mstc->port->vcpi here. So to make life easier
for anyone who bisects this code in the future, use msto->disabled
instead to check whether or not we need to deallocate VCPI instead.
