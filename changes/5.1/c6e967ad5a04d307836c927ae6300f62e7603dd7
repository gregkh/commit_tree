ARM: dts: Add wlcore wakeirq for omap3-evm

With wlcore supporting optional wakeirqs, let's configure it for
omap3-evm and update the related pin muxing as some pins are left
unmuxed.

Let's configure a wakeirq both for the wlcore GPIO and the SDIO
dat1 pin in case wlcore starts supporting SDIO dat1 interrupt at
some point.

Note that for off-mode, the wlcore reset GPIO will have a glitch
meaning wlcore will reset. The only way to workaround for this
currently is to configure the reset pin with SAFE_MODE + PULL.
