KVM: arm/arm64: consolidate arch timer trap handlers

At the moment we have separate system register emulation handlers for
each timer register. Actually they are quite similar, and we rely on
kvm_arm_timer_[gs]et_reg() for the actual emulation anyways, so let's
just merge all of those handlers into one function, which just marshalls
the arguments and then hands off to a set of common accessors.
This makes extending the emulation to include EL2 timers much easier.
