selftests/bpf: skip verifier tests for unsupported program types

Use recently introduced bpf_probe_prog_type() to skip tests in the
test_verifier() if bpf_verify_program() fails. The skipped test is
indicated in the output.

Example:

...
679/p bpf_get_stack return R0 within range SKIP (unsupported program
type 5)
680/p ld_abs: invalid op 1 OK
...
Summary: 863 PASSED, 165 SKIPPED, 3 FAILED
