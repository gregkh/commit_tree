introduce cloning of fs_context

new primitive: vfs_dup_fs_context().  Comes with fs_context
method (->dup()) for copying the filesystem-specific parts
of fs_context, along with LSM one (->fs_context_dup()) for
doing the same to LSM parts.

[needs better commit message, and change of Author:, anyway]
