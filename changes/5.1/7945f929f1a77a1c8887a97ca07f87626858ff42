drivers: provide devm_platform_ioremap_resource()

There are currently 1200+ instances of using platform_get_resource()
and devm_ioremap_resource() together in the kernel tree.

This patch wraps these two calls in a single helper. Thanks to that
we don't have to declare a local variable for struct resource * and can
omit the redundant argument for resource type. We also have one
function call less.
