drm/i915: Fix > vs >= mismatch in watermark/ddb calculations

Bspec says we have to reject the watermark if it's >= the ddb
allocation. Fix the code to reject the == case as it should.
For transition watermarks we can just use >=, for the rest
we'll do +1 when calculating the minimum ddb allocation size.
