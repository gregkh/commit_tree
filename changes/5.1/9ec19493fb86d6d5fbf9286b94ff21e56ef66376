KVM: x86: clear SMM flags before loading state while leaving SMM

RSM emulation is currently broken on VMX when the interrupted guest has
CR4.VMXE=1.  Stop dancing around the issue of HF_SMM_MASK being set when
loading SMSTATE into architectural state, e.g. by toggling it for
problematic flows, and simply clear HF_SMM_MASK prior to loading
architectural state (from SMRAM save state area).
