ALSA: hda/realtek - Add quirk for Tuxedo XC 1509

This adds a SND_PCI_QUIRK(...) line for the Tuxedo XC 1509.

The Tuxedo XC 1509 and the System76 oryp5 are the same barebone
notebooks manufactured by Clevo. To name the fixups both use after the
actual underlying hardware, this patch also changes System76_orpy5
to clevo_pb51ed in 2 enum symbols and one function name,
matching the other pci_quirk entries which are also named after the
device ODM.
