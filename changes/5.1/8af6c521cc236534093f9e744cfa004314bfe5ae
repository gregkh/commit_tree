ASoC: rsnd: gen: fix SSI9 4/5/6/7 busif related register address

Currently each SSI unit 's busif mode/adinr/dalign address is
registered by: (in busif4 case)
RSND_GEN_M_REG(SSI_BUSIF4_MODE, 0x500, 0x80)
RSND_GEN_M_REG(SSI_BUSIF4_ADINR,0x504, 0x80)
RSND_GEN_M_REG(SSI_BUSIF4_DALIGN, 0x508, 0x80)

But according to user manual 41.1.4 Register Configuration
ssi9 4/5/6/7 busif mode/adinr/dalign register address
( SSI9-[4/5/6/7]_BUSIF_[MODE/ADINR/DALIGN] )
are out of this rule.

This patch registers ssi9 4/5/6/7 mode/adinr/dalign register
as single register, and access these registers in case of
SSI9 BUSIF 4/5/6/7.

Fixes: commit 8c9d75033340 ("ASoC: rsnd: ssiu: Support BUSIF other than BUSIF0")
