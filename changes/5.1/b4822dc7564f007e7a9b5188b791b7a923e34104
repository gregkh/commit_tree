clocksource/drivers/tegra: Add Tegra210 timer support

Add support for the Tegra210 timer that runs at oscillator clock
(TMR10-TMR13). We need these timers to work as clock event device and to
replace the ARMv8 architected timer due to it can't survive across the
power cycle of the CPU core or CPUPORESET signal. So it can't be a wake-up
source when CPU suspends in power down state.

Also convert the original driver to use timer-of API.
