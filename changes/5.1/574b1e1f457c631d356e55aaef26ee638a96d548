devlink: Modify reply of DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_GET

Avoid sending attributes related to recovery:
DEVLINK_ATTR_HEALTH_REPORTER_GRACEFUL_PERIOD and
DEVLINK_ATTR_HEALTH_REPORTER_AUTO_RECOVER in reply to
DEVLINK_CMD_HEALTH_REPORTER_GET for a reporter which didn't register a
recover operation.
These parameters can't be configured on a reporter that did not provide
a recover operation, thus not needed to return them.
