New fields were added to struct iwl_fw_ini_region_cfg.
add those field and apply the changes the result from this change

offset field is used to differentiate between the different LMACs
and any memory access to the region addresses should be
base_addr + offset.

A fifo struct is to hold the meta data needed for fifo regions

Also move range_data_size and num_of_ranges into a struct under the
union to be aligned to the struct in the FW.
