ALSA: hda/tegra: property for card name

An optional property "nvidia,model" is introduced for hda to pass custom
name for the sound card. The suffix "-hda" in the name passed is useful
to distinguish between multiple cards available for a platform.
When the property is not specified, default name("tegra-hda") mentioned
in hda driver is used. This property can be added in platform specific
file of the board and card name can relate to the board in use.
