bridge: join all-snoopers multicast address

Next to snooping IGMP/MLD queries RFC4541, section 2.1.1.a) recommends
to snoop multicast router advertisements to detect multicast routers.

Multicast router advertisements are sent to an "all-snoopers"
multicast address. To be able to receive them reliably, we need to
join this group.

Otherwise other snooping switches might refrain from forwarding these
advertisements to us.
