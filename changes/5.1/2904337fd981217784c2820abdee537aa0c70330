s390/cio: Use cpa range elsewhere within vfio-ccw

Since we have a little function to see whether a channel
program address falls within a range of CCWs, let's use
it in the other places of code that make these checks.

(Why isn't ccw_head fully removed?  Well, because this
way some longs lines don't have to be reflowed.)
