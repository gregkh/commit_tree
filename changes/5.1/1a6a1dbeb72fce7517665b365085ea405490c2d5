lib/ubsan: default UBSAN_ALIGNMENT to not set

When booting an allmodconfig kernel, there are a lot of false-positives.
With a message like this 'UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in...' with a call
trace that follows.

UBSAN warnings are a result of enabling noisy CONFIG_UBSAN_ALIGNMENT
which is disabled by default if HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS=y.

It's noisy even if don't have efficient unaligned access, e.g.  people
often add __cacheline_aligned_in_smp in structs, but forget to align
allocations of such struct (kmalloc() give 8-byte alignment in worst
case).

Rework so that when building a allmodconfig kernel that turns everything
into '=m' or '=y' will turn off UBSAN_ALIGNMENT.
