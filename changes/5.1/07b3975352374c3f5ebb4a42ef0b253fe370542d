net: stmmac: don't stop NAPI processing when dropping a packet

Currently, if we drop a packet, we exit from NAPI loop before the budget
is consumed. In some situations this will make the RX processing stall
e.g. when flood pinging the system with oversized packets, as the
errorneous packets are not dropped efficiently.

If we drop a packet, we should just continue to the next one as long as
the budget allows.
