HID: intel-ish-hid: remove data[128] usage on stack when sending HBM request

Instead of using an 128-byte on-stack array to store the request, we can
instantiate the request on stack directly. This can save the stack usage of
these functions, since most of the requests are much smaller than 128 bytes.
