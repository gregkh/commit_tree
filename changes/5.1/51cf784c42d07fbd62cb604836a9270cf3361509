device-dax: Start defining a dax bus model

Towards eliminating the dax_class, move the dax-device-attribute
enabling to a new bus.c file in the core. The amount of code
thrash of sub-sequent patches is reduced as no logic changes are made,
just pure code movement.

A temporary export of unregister_dex_dax() and dax_attribute_groups is
needed to preserve compilation, but those symbols become static again in
a follow-on patch.
