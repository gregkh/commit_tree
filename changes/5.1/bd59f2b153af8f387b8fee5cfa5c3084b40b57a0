drm/todo: Tick off some tinydrm entries

- Better manual-upload support for atomic
  The new damage helper has the necessary pieces to make this work.

- tinydrm_gem_cma_prime_import_sg_table
  This is now moved to the CMA helper and can be set using the
  DRM_GEM_CMA_VMAP_DRIVER_OPS macro.

- tinydrm_fb_create
  This is now covered by drm_gem_fb_create_with_dirty()
