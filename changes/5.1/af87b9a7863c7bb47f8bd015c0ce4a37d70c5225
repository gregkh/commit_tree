libnvdimm: Schedule device registration on node local to the device

Force the device registration for nvdimm devices to be closer to the actual
device. This is achieved by using either the NUMA node ID of the region, or
of the parent. By doing this we can have everything above the region based
on the region, and everything below the region based on the nvdimm bus.

By guaranteeing NUMA locality I see an improvement of as high as 25% for
per-node init of a system with 12TB of persistent memory.
