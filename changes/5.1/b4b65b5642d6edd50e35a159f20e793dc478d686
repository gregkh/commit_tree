KVM: x86: cleanup freeing of nested state

Ensure that the VCPU free path goes through vmx_leave_nested and
thus nested_vmx_vmexit, so that the cancellation of the timer does
not have to be in free_nested.  In addition, because some paths through
nested_vmx_vmexit do not go through sync_vmcs12, the cancellation of
the timer is moved there.
