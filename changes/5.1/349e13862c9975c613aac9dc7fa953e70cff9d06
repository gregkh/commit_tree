ASoC: Intel: bytcht_es8316: Add support for SSP0 (BYTCR)

Add support for having the codec connected to SSP0 instead of SSP2. This
is controlled through a new quirk parameter, similar to how this is done
in the bytcr_rt5640 and bytcr_rt5651 machine drivers.

Bay Trail CR (cost reduced) SoCs do not have an SSP2, so we default to SSP0
there.

Note the SPP0 quirk gets BIT(16) because bits 0-15 are reserved for non
boolean quirks like the input-map added in a later commit in this series.
