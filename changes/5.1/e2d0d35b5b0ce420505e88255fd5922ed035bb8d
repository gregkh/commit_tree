batman-adv: Add gateway mesh genl configuration

The mesh/soft-interface can optimize the handling of DHCP packets. Instead
of flooding them through the whole mesh, it can be forwarded as unicast to
a specific gateway server. The originator which injects the packets in the
mesh has to select (based on sel_class thresholds) a responsible gateway
server. This is done by switching this originator to the gw_mode client.
The servers announce their forwarding bandwidth (download/upload) when the
gw_mode server was selected.

The BATADV_CMD_SET_MESH/BATADV_CMD_GET_MESH commands allow to set/get the
configuration of this feature using the attributes:

* u8 BATADV_ATTR_GW_MODE (0 == off, 1 == client, 2 == server)
* u32 BATADV_ATTR_GW_BANDWIDTH_DOWN (in 100 kbit/s steps)
* u32 BATADV_ATTR_GW_BANDWIDTH_UP (in 100 kbit/s steps)
* u32 BATADV_ATTR_GW_SEL_CLASS
