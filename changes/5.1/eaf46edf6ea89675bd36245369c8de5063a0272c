crypto: arm64/aes-ccm - fix logical bug in AAD MAC handling

The NEON MAC calculation routine fails to handle the case correctly
where there is some data in the buffer, and the input fills it up
exactly. In this case, we enter the loop at the end with w8 == 0,
while a negative value is assumed, and so the loop carries on until
the increment of the 32-bit counter wraps around, which is quite
obviously wrong.

So omit the loop altogether in this case, and exit right away.
