usb: core: Simplify return value of usb_get_configuration()

It is better to initialize the return value "result" to -ENOMEM
than to 0. And because "result" takes the return value of
usb_parse_configuration() which returns 0 for success, setting
"result" to 0 at before and after of the for loop is unnecessary.
