misc/mei/hdcp: Client driver for HDCP application

ME FW contributes a vital role in HDCP2.2 authentication.
HDCP2.2 driver needs to communicate to ME FW for each step of the
HDCP2.2 authentication.

ME FW prepare and HDCP2.2 authentication  parameters and encrypt them
as per spec. With such parameter Driver prepares HDCP2.2 auth messages
and communicate with HDCP2.2 sink.

Similarly HDCP2.2 sink's response is shared with ME FW for decrypt and
verification.

Once All the steps of HDCP2.2 authentications are complete on driver's
request ME FW will configure the port as authenticated and supply the
HDCP keys to the Gen HW for encryption.

Only after this stage HDCP2.2 driver can start the HDCP2.2 encryption
for a port.

ME FW is interfaced to kernel through MEI Bus Driver. To obtain the
HDCP2.2 services from the ME FW through MEI Bus driver MEI Client
Driver is developed.
