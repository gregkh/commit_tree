binder: reduce mmap_sem write-side lock

binder has used write-side mmap_sem semaphore to release memory
mapped at address space of the process. However, right lock to
release pages is down_read, not down_write because page table lock
already protects the race for parallel freeing.

Please do not use mmap_sem write-side lock which is well known
contented lock.
