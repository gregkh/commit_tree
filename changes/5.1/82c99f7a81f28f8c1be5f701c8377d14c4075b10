perf/x86/intel: Update KBL Package C-state events to also include PC8/PC9/PC10 counters

Kaby Lake (and Coffee Lake) has PC8/PC9/PC10 residency counters.

This patch updates the list of Kaby/Coffee Lake PMU event counters
from the snb_cstates[] list of events to the hswult_cstates[]
list of events, which keeps all previously supported events and
also adds the PKG_C8, PKG_C9 and PKG_C10 residency counters.

This allows user space tools to profile them through the perf interface.
