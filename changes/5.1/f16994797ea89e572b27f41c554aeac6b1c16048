cifs: fix incorrect handling of smb2_set_sparse() return in smb3_simple_falloc

smb2_set_sparse does not return -errno, it returns a boolean where
true means success.
Change this to just ignore the return value just like the other callsites.

Additionally add code to handle the case where we must set the file sparse
and possibly also extending it.
