smb3: request more credits on tree connect

If we try large I/O (read or write) immediately after mount
we won't typically have enough credits because we only request
large amounts of credits on the first session setup.  So if
large I/O is attempted soon after mount we will typically only
have about 43 credits rather than 105 credits (with this patch)
available for the large i/o (which needs 64 credits minimum).

This patch requests more credits during tree connect, which
helps ensure that we have enough credits when mount completes
(between these requests and the first session setup) in order
 to start large I/O immediately after mount if needed.
