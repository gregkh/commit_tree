sched: Replace synchronize_sched() with synchronize_rcu()

Now that synchronize_rcu() waits for preempt-disable regions of
code as well as RCU read-side critical sections, synchronize_sched()
can be replaced by synchronize_rcu(), in fact, synchronize_sched()
is now completely equivalent to synchronize_rcu().  This commit
therefore replaces synchronize_sched() with synchronize_rcu() so that
synchronize_sched() can eventually be removed entirely.
