KVM: nVMX: always use early vmcs check when EPT is disabled

The remaining failures of vmx.flat when EPT is disabled are caused by
incorrectly reflecting VMfails to the L1 hypervisor.  What happens is
that nested_vmx_restore_host_state corrupts the guest CR3, reloading it
with the host's shadow CR3 instead, because it blindly loads GUEST_CR3
from the vmcs01.

For simplicity let's just always use hardware VMCS checks when EPT is
disabled.  This way, nested_vmx_restore_host_state is not reached at
all (or at least shouldn't be reached).
