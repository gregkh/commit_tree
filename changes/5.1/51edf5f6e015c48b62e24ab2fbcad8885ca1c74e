btf: allow to customize dedup hash table size

Default size of dedup table (16k) is good enough for most binaries, even
typical vmlinux images. But there are cases of binaries with huge amount
of BTF types (e.g., allyesconfig variants of kernel), which benefit from
having bigger dedup table size to lower amount of unnecessary hash
collisions. Tools like pahole, thus, can tune this parameter to reach
optimal performance.

This change also serves double purpose of allowing tests to force hash
collisions to test some corner cases, used in follow up patch.
