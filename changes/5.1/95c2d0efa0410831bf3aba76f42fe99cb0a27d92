pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7790: Initialize TDSEL register for ES1.0

Documentation for ES1.0 says that some bits in TDSEL must be set (ch
5.3.39 in R-Car H2 v0.91). However, the reset value of the register is
0, so software has to do it. Add this to the kernel driver to ensure
this is really done independent of firmware versions and use
whitelisting for ES versions known to need this.

This is needed for some SD cards supporting SDR104 transfer mode. For
me, TDSEL was not initialized by the firmware and I had problems with
the card when re-inserting it.
