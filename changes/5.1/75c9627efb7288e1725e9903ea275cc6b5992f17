ceph: map snapid to anonymous bdev ID

ceph_getattr() return zero dev ID for head inodes and set dev ID to
snapid directly for snaphost inodes. This is not good because userspace
utilities may consider device ID of 0 as invalid, snapid may conflict
with other device's ID.

This patch introduces "snapids to anonymous bdev IDs" map. we create a
new mapping when we see a snapid for the first time. we trim unused
mapping after it is ilde for 5 minutes.
