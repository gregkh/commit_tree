crypto: arm64/ghash - register PMULL variants as separate algos

The arm64 GHASH implementation either uses 8-bit or 64-bit
polynomial multiplication instructions, since the latter are
faster but not mandatory in the architecture.

Since that prevents us from testing both implementations on the
same system, let's expose both implementations to the crypto API,
with the priorities reflecting that the P64 version is the
preferred one if available.
