fuse: Verify userspace asks to requeue interrupt that we really sent

When queue_interrupt() is called from fuse_dev_do_write(), it came from
userspace directly. Userspace may pass any request id, even the request's
we have not interrupted (or even background's request). This patch adds
sanity check to make kernel safe against that.
