btrfs: move to function pointers for get/put workspaces

The previous patch added generic helpers for get_workspace() and
put_workspace(). Now, we can migrate ownership of the workspace_manager
to be in the compression type code as the compression code itself
doesn't care beyond being able to get a workspace. The init/cleanup and
get/put methods are abstracted so each compression algorithm can decide
how they want to manage their workspaces.
