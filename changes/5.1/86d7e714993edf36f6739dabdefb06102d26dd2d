net/mlx5e: Update tx reporter status in case channels were successfully opened

Once channels were successfully opened, update tx reporter health state to
healthy. This is needed for the following scenario:
- SQ has an un-recovered error reported to the devlink health, resulting tx
  reporter state to be error.
- Current channels (including this SQ) are closed
- New channels are opened
After that flow, the original error was "solved", and tx reporter state
should be healthy. However, as it was resolved as a side effect, and not
via tx reporter recover method, driver needs to inform devlink health
about it.
