sparc64/pci_sun4v: fix ATU checks for large DMA masks

Now that we allow drivers to always need to set larger than required
DMA masks we need to be a little more careful in the sun4v PCI iommu
driver to chose when to select the ATU support - a larger DMA mask
can be set even when the platform does not support ATU, so we always
have to check if it is avaiable before using it.  Add a little helper
for that and use it in all the places where we make ATU usage decisions
based on the DMA mask.
