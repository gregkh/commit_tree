drm/amd/display: Restructure DCN10 hubbub

[Why]
Change DCN10 hubbub to use hubbub as a base and allow all future DCN
hubbubs to do the same instead of using DCN10_hubbub. This increases
readability and doesn't require future hubbubs to inherit anything
other than the base hubbub struct.

[How]
Create separate DCN10_hubbub struct which uses the hubbub struct as
a base.
