nfsd: Don't release the callback slot unless it was actually held

If there are multiple callbacks queued, waiting for the callback
slot when the callback gets shut down, then they all currently
end up acting as if they hold the slot, and call
nfsd4_cb_sequence_done() resulting in interesting side-effects.

In addition, the 'retry_nowait' path in nfsd4_cb_sequence_done()
causes a loop back to nfsd4_cb_prepare() without first freeing the
slot, which causes a deadlock when nfsd41_cb_get_slot() gets called
a second time.

This patch therefore adds a boolean to track whether or not the
callback did pick up the slot, so that it can do the right thing
in these 2 cases.
