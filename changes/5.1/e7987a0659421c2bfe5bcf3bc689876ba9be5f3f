dmaengine: at_hdmac: drop useless LIST_HEAD

Drop LIST_HEAD where the variable it declares is never used.

tmp_list has been declared since the introduction of the driver
and has never been used.  The two declarations of list were
introduced with the containing functions but were also not used.

The semantic patch that fixes this problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
identifier x;
@@
- LIST_HEAD(x);
  ... when != x
// </smpl>
