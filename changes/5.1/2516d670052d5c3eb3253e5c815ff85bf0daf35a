cpufreq: arm_big_little: Register an Energy Model

Now that PM_OPP provides a helper function to estimate the power
consumed by CPUs, make sure to try and register an Energy Model (EM)
from the arm_big_little CPUFreq driver, hence ensuring interested
subsystems (the task scheduler, for example) can make use of that
information when available.
