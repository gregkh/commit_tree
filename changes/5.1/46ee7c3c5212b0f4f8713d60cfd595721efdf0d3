powerpc/eeh: Use debugfs_create_u32 for eeh_max_freezes

There's no need to the custom getter/setter functions so we should remove
them in favour of using the generic one. While we're here, change the type
of eeh_max_freeze to u32 and print the value in decimal rather than
hex because printing it in hex makes no sense.
