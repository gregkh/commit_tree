MIPS: mm: Add set_cpu_context() for ASID assignments

When we gain MMID support we'll be storing MMIDs as atomic64_t values
and accessing them via atomic64_* functions. This necessitates that we
don't use cpu_context() as the left hand side of an assignment, ie. as a
modifiable lvalue. In preparation for this introduce a new
set_cpu_context() function & replace all assignments with cpu_context()
on their left hand side with an equivalent call to set_cpu_context().

To enforce that cpu_context() should not be used for assignments, we
rewrite it as a static inline function.
