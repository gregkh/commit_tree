net: bridge: fix per-port af_packet sockets

When the commit below was introduced it changed two visible things:
 - the skb was no longer passed through the protocol handlers with the
   original device
 - the skb was passed up the stack with skb->dev = bridge

The first change broke af_packet sockets on bridge ports. For example we
use them for hostapd which listens for ETH_P_PAE packets on the ports.
We discussed two possible fixes:
 - create a clone and pass it through NF_HOOK(), act on the original skb
   based on the result
 - somehow signal to the caller from the okfn() that it was called,
   meaning the skb is ok to be passed, which this patch is trying to
   implement via returning 1 from the bridge link-local okfn()

Note that we rely on the fact that NF_QUEUE/STOLEN would return 0 and
drop/error would return < 0 thus the okfn() is called only when the
return was 1, so we signal to the caller that it was called by preserving
the return value from nf_hook().
