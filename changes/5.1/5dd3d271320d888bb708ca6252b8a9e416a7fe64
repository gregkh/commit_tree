ALSA: hda: Add api to program stripe control bits

Controllers and codecs can support striping of audio out across
multiple SDO lines. The number of supported SDO lines can be
specific to chip. GCAP register can be read to know the maximum
supported SDO lines.

snd_hdac_get_stream_stripe_ctl() is exposed to program stripe bits
on controller and codec side.
stripe value: 0 for 1SDO, 1 for 2SDO, 2 for 4SDO lines, etc.,
