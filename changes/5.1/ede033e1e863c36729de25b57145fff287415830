dt-bindings: gpio: document the new pull-up/pull-down flags

This commit extends the flags that can be used in GPIO specifiers to
indicate if a pull-up resistor or pull-down resistor should be
enabled.

While some pinctrl DT bindings already offer the capability of
configuring pull-up/pull-down resistors at the pin level, a number of
simple GPIO controllers don't have any pinmuxing capability, and
therefore do not rely on the pinctrl DT bindings.

Such simple GPIO controllers however sometimes allow to configure
pull-up and pull-down resistors on a per-pin basis, and whether such
resistors should be enabled or not is a highly board-specific HW
characteristic.

By using two additional bits of the GPIO flag specifier, we can easily
allow the Device Tree to describe which GPIOs should have their
pull-up or pull-down resistors enabled. Even though the two options
are mutually exclusive, we still need two bits to encode at least
three states: no pull-up/pull-down, pull-up, pull-down.
