sparc64: add custom adjtimex/clock_adjtime functions

sparc64 is the only architecture on Linux that has a 'timeval'
definition with a 32-bit tv_usec but a 64-bit tv_sec. This causes
problems for sparc32 compat mode when we convert it to use the
new __kernel_timex type that has the same layout as all other
64-bit architectures.

To avoid adding sparc64 specific code into the generic adjtimex
implementation, this adds a wrapper in the sparc64 system call handling
that converts the sparc64 'timex' into the new '__kernel_timex'.

At this point, the two structures are defined to be identical,
but that will change in the next step once we convert sparc32.
