tools/memory-model: Add scripts to check github litmus tests

The https://github.com/paulmckrcu/litmus repository contains a large
number of C-language litmus tests that include "Result:" comments
predicting the verification result.  This commit adds a number of scripts
that run tests on these litmus tests:

checkghlitmus.sh:
	Runs all litmus tests in the https://github.com/paulmckrcu/litmus
        archive that are C-language and that have "Result:" comment lines
	documenting expected results, comparing the actual results to
	those expected.  Clones the repository if it has not already
	been cloned into the "tools/memory-model/litmus" directory.

initlitmushist.sh
	Run all litmus tests having no more than the specified number
	of processes given a specified timeout, recording the results in
	.litmus.out files.  Clones the repository if it has not already
	been cloned into the "tools/memory-model/litmus" directory.

newlitmushist.sh
	For all new or updated litmus tests having no more than the
	specified number of processes given a specified timeout, run
	and record the results in .litmus.out files.

checklitmushist.sh
	Run all litmus tests having .litmus.out files from previous
	initlitmushist.sh or newlitmushist.sh runs, comparing the
	herd output to that of the original runs.

The above scripts will run litmus tests concurrently, by default with
one job per available CPU.  Giving any of these scripts the --help
argument will cause them to print usage information.

This commit also adds a number of helper scripts that are not intended
to be invoked from the command line:

cmplitmushist.sh: Compare the output of two different runs of the same
	litmus test.

judgelitmus.sh: Compare the output of a litmus test to its "Result:"
	comment line.

parseargs.sh: Parse command-line arguments.

runlitmushist.sh: Run the litmus tests whose pathnames are provided one
	per line on standard input.

While in the area, this commit also makes the existing checklitmus.sh
and checkalllitmus.sh scripts use parseargs.sh in order to provide a
bit of uniformity.  In addition, per-litmus-test status output is directed
to stdout, while end-of-test summary information is directed to stderr.
Finally, the error flag standardizes on "!!!" to assist those familiar
with rcutorture output.

The defaults for the parseargs.sh arguments may be overridden by using
environment variables: LKMM_DESTDIR for --destdir, LKMM_HERD_OPTIONS
for --herdoptions, LKMM_JOBS for --jobs, LKMM_PROCS for --procs, and
LKMM_TIMEOUT for --timeout.
