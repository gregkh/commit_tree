libbpf: Introduce bpf_object__btf

Add new accessor for bpf_object to get opaque struct btf * from it.

struct btf * is needed for all operations with BTF and it's present in
bpf_object. The only thing missing is a way to get it.

Example use-case is to get BTF key_type_id and value_type_id for a map in
bpf_object. It can be done with btf__get_map_kv_tids() but that function
requires struct btf *.

Similar API can be added for struct btf_ext but no use-case for it yet.
