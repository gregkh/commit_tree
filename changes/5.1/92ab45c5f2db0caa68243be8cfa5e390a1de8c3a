powerpc: Avoid circular header inclusion in mmu-hash.h

When activating CONFIG_THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK, linux/sched.h includes
asm/current.h. This generates a circular dependency. To avoid that,
asm/processor.h shall not be included in mmu-hash.h.

In order to do that, this patch moves into a new header called
asm/task_size_64/32.h all the TASK_SIZE related constants, which can
then be included in mmu-hash.h directly.
