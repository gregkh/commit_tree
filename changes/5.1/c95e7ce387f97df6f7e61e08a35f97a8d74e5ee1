drm/i915/selftests: Create a clean GGTT for vma/gtt selftesting

Some tests (e.g. igt_vma_pin1) presume that we have a completely clean
GGTT so that it can probe boundaries without fear that something is
already allocated there. However, the mock device is starting to get
complicated and following similar rules to the live device, i.e. we
can't guarantee that i915->ggtt remains clean, so create a temporary
address_space equivalent to the mock ggtt for the purpose.
