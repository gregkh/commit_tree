riscv/vdso: don't clear PG_reserved

The VDSO is part of the kernel image and therefore the struct pages are
marked as reserved during boot.

As we install a special mapping, the actual struct pages will never be
exposed to MM via the page tables.  We can therefore leave the pages
marked as reserved.
