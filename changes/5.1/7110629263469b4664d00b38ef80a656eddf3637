tpm: fix an invalid condition in tpm_common_poll

The poll condition should only check response_length,
because reads should only be issued if there is data to read.
The response_read flag only prevents double writes.
The problem was that the write set the response_read to false,
enqued a tpm job, and returned. Then application called poll
which checked the response_read flag and returned EPOLLIN.
Then the application called read, but got nothing.
After all that the async_work kicked in.
Added also mutex_lock around the poll check to prevent
other possible race conditions.
