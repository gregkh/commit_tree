null_blk: prevent crash from bad home_node value

At module load, if the selected home_node value is greater than
the available numa nodes, the system will crash in
__alloc_pages_nodemask() due to a bad paging request.  Prevent this
user error crash by detecting the bad value, logging an error, and
setting g_home_node back to the default of NUMA_NO_NODE.
