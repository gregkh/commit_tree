Revert "KVM: Eliminate extra function calls in kvm_get_dirty_log_protect()"

The value of "dirty_bitmap[i]" is already check before setting its value
to mask. The following check of "mask" is redundant. The check of "mask" was
introduced by commit 58d2930f4ee3 ("KVM: Eliminate extra function calls in
kvm_get_dirty_log_protect()"), revert it.
