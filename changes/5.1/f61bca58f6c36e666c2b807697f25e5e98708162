net/smc: move unhash before release of clcsock

Commit <26d92e951fe0>
("net/smc: move unhash as early as possible in smc_release()")
fixes one occurrence in the smc code, but the same pattern exists
in other places. This patch covers the remaining occurrences and
makes sure, the unhash operation is done before the smc->clcsock is
released. This avoids a potential use-after-free in smc_diag_dump().
