selinux: fix NULL dereference in policydb_destroy()

The conversion to kvmalloc() forgot to account for the possibility that
p->type_attr_map_array might be null in policydb_destroy().

Fix this by destroying its contents only if it is not NULL.

Also make sure ebitmap_init() is called on all entries before
policydb_destroy() can be called. Right now this is a no-op, because
both kvcalloc() and ebitmap_init() just zero out the whole struct, but
let's rather not rely on a specific implementation.
