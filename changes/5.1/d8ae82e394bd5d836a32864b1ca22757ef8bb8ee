xfs: split XFS_BMAPI_DELALLOC handling from xfs_bmapi_write

Delalloc conversion has traditionally been part of our function to
allocate blocks on disk (first xfs_bmapi, then xfs_bmapi_write), but
delalloc conversion is a little special as we really do not want
to allocate blocks over holes, for which we don't have reservations.

Split the delalloc conversions into a separate helper to keep the
code simple and structured.
