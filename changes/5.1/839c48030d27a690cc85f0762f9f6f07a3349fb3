habanalabs: add basic Goya h/w initialization

This patch adds the basic part of Goya's H/W initialization. It adds code
that initializes Goya's internal CPU, various registers that are related to
internal routing, scrambling, workarounds for H/W bugs, etc.

It also initializes Goya's security scheme that prevents the user from
abusing Goya to steal data from the host, crash the host, change
Goya's F/W, etc.
