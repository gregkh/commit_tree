KVM: Never start grow vCPU halt_poll_ns from value below halt_poll_ns_grow_start

grow_halt_poll_ns() have a strange behaviour in case
(vcpu->halt_poll_ns != 0) &&
(vcpu->halt_poll_ns < halt_poll_ns_grow_start).

In this case, vcpu->halt_poll_ns will be multiplied by grow factor
(halt_poll_ns_grow) which will require several grow iteration in order
to reach a value bigger than halt_poll_ns_grow_start.
This means that growing vcpu->halt_poll_ns from value of 0 is slower
than growing it from a positive value less than halt_poll_ns_grow_start.
Which is misleading and inaccurate.

Fix issue by changing grow_halt_poll_ns() to set vcpu->halt_poll_ns
to halt_poll_ns_grow_start in any case that
(vcpu->halt_poll_ns < halt_poll_ns_grow_start).
Regardless if vcpu->halt_poll_ns is 0.

use READ_ONCE to get a consistent number for all cases.
