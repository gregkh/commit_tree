net: hns3: do reinitialization while mqprio configuration changed

When user changes the mqprio configuration, enet need to be
uninited and inited besides down'ed and up'ed, because the queue
num may change when the TC num changes.

Also, it is more suitable to do the down/unint/init/up operation
in hclge module using hclge_notify_client, because this config
change may affect PF and its VF.
