mlxsw: spectrum_switchdev: Handle SWITCHDEV_PORT_ATTR_SET

Following patches will change the way we communicate setting a port's
attribute and use a notifier to perform those tasks.

Prepare mlxsw to support receiving notifier events targeting
SWITCHDEV_PORT_ATTR_SET and utilize the switchdev_handle_port_attr_set()
to handle stacking of devices.
