libbpf: Add a helper for retrieving a map fd for a given name

XDP samples are mostly cooperating with eBPF maps through their file
descriptors. In case of a eBPF program that contains multiple maps it
might be tiresome to iterate through them and call bpf_map__fd for each
one. Add a helper mostly based on bpf_object__find_map_by_name, but
instead of returning the struct bpf_map pointer, return map fd.
