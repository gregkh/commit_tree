net/mlx5: E-Switch, Disable esw manager vport correctly

When disabling vport, relevant vport configurations will be cleaned
up. These cleanups should be done to the vports which had these configs
applied at vport enablement. As esw manager vport didn't have such
vport config applied, cleanup should not touch it.
