mic: Rename ioremap pointer to remap

Some architectures (like MIPS) implement ioremap as a macro, and this
leads to conflicts with the ioremap function pointer in various mic
structures.

 drivers/misc/mic/vop/vop_vringh.c:
   In function 'vop_virtio_init_post':
 drivers/misc/mic/vop/vop_vringh.c:86:13:
   error: macro "ioremap" passed 3 arguments, but takes just 2

Rename ioremap to remap to fix this.  Likewise for iounmap.
