i2c: ocores: do not handle IRQ if IF is not set

If the Interrupt Flag (IF) is not set, we should not handle the IRQ:
- the line can be shared with other devices
- it can be a spurious interrupt

To avoid reading twice the status register, the ocores_process() function
expects it to be read by the caller.
