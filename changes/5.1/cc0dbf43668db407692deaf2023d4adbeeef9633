arm: dts: vexpress-v2p-ca15_a7: Add cpu dynamic-power-coefficient information

A CPUfreq driver, like the ARM big.LITTLE driver used on the TC2 board,
which provide the Energy Model with power cost information via the
PM_OPP of_dev_pm_opp_get_cpu_power() function, do need the
dynamic-power-coefficient (C) in the device tree.

Method used to obtain the C value:

C is computed by measuring energy (E) consumption of a frequency domain
(FD) over a 10s runtime (t) sysbench workload running at each Operating
Performance Point (OPP) affine to 1 or 2 CPUs of that FD while the other
CPUs of the system are hotplugged out.

By definition all CPUs of a FD have the the same micro-architecture. An
OPP is characterized by a certain frequency (f) and voltage (V) value.
The corresponding power values (P) are calculated by dividing the delta
of the E values between the runs with 2 and 1 CPUs by t.

With n data tuples (P, f, V), n equal to number of OPPs for this
frequency domain, we can solve C by:

P = Pstat + Pdyn

P = Pstat + CV²f

Cx = (Px - P1)/(Vx²fx - V1²f1) with x = {2, ..., n}

The C value is the arithmetic mean out of {C2, ..., Cn}.
