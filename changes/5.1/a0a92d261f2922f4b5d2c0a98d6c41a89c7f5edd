fsnotify: move mask out of struct fsnotify_event

Common fsnotify_event helpers have no need for the mask field.
It is only used by backend code, so move the field out of the
abstract fsnotify_event struct and into the concrete backend
event structs.

This change packs struct inotify_event_info better on 64bit
machine and will allow us to cram some more fields into
struct fanotify_event_info.
