ASoC: cs35l35: Disable regulators on driver removal

The chips main power supplies VA and VP are enabled during probe but
then never disabled, this will cause warnings from the regulator
framework on driver removal. Fix this by adding a remove callback and
disabling the supplies, whilst doing so follow best practice and put the
chip back into reset as well.
