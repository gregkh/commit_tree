mm/filemap.c: remove redundant test from find_get_pages_contig

After we establish a reference on the page, we check the pointer
continues to be in the correct position in i_pages.  Checking
page->index afterwards is unnecessary; if it were to change, then the
pointer to it from the page cache would also move.  The check used to be
done before grabbing a reference on the page which was racy (see commit
9cbb4cb21b19f ("mm: find_get_pages_contig fixlet")), but nobody noticed
that moving the check after grabbing the reference was redundant.
