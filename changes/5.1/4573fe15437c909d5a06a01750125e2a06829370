dynamic_debug: use pointer comparison in ddebug_remove_module

Now that we store the passed-in string directly in ddebug_add_module, we
can use pointer equality instead of strcmp.  This is a little more
efficient, but more importantly, this also makes the code somewhat more
correct:

Currently, if one loads and then unloads a module whose name happens to
match the KBUILD_MODNAME of some built-in functionality (which need not
even be modular at all), all of their dynamic debug entries vanish along
with those of the actual module.  For example, loading and unloading a
core.ko hides all pr_debugs from drivers/base/core.c and other built-in
files called core.c (incidentally, there is an in-tree module whose name
is core, but I just tested this with an out-of-tree trivial one).
