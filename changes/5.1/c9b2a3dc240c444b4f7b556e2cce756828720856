MIPS: mm: Consolidate drop_mmu_context() has-ASID checks

If an mm does not have an ASID on the local CPU then drop_mmu_context()
is always redundant, since there's no context to "drop". Various callers
of drop_mmu_context() check whether the mm has been allocated an ASID
before making the call. Move that check into drop_mmu_context() and
remove it from callers to simplify them.
