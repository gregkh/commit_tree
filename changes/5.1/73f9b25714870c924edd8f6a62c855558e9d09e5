rsi: resolve power save issue after S4 resume

We are redownloading the firmware after S4 restore and observed in
stress test that mac80211 sometimes gives power save request after
resume which causes the firmware in bad state. mac_ops_resumed flag
is added to skip that request until initialisation is done and Keeping
power save state is NONE.
