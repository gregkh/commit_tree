mfd: htc-i2cpld: Make it explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig for this option is currently:

config HTC_I2CPLD
        bool "HTC I2C PLD chip support"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.
Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
