ASoC: es8316: Add jack-detect support

Adding jack-detect support may seem weird for a codec with only
a single output, but it is necessary. The ES8316 appnote showing
the intended usage uses a jack-receptacle which physically disconnects
the speakers from the output when a jack is plugged in.

But all 3 devices using the es8316 which I have (2 Cherry Trail
devices and one Bay Trail CR device), use an analog mux to disconnect
the speakers, driven by a GPIO. In order to enable/disable the speakers
at the right time, we need jack-detect.

The same goes for the microphone where we must correctly set the mux
for the single ADC to either the internal or the headset microphone.

All devices I have support the es8316's builtin jack-detect functionality.
