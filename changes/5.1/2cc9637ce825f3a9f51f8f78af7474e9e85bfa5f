s390/dasd: Fix capacity calculation for large volumes

The DASD driver incorrectly limits the maximum number of blocks of ECKD
DASD volumes to 32 bit numbers. Volumes with a capacity greater than
2^32-1 blocks are incorrectly recognized as smaller volumes.

This results in the following volume capacity limits depending on the
formatted block size:

  BLKSIZE  MAX_GB   MAX_CYL
      512    2047   5843492
     1024    4095   8676701
     2048    8191  13634816
     4096   16383  23860929

The same problem occurs when a volume with more than 17895697 cylinders
is accessed in raw-track-access mode.

Fix this problem by adding an explicit type cast when calculating the
maximum number of blocks.
