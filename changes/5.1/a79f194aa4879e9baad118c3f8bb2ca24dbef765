NFSv4/flexfiles: Abort I/O early if the layout segment was invalidated

If a layout segment gets invalidated while a pNFS I/O operation
is queued for transmission, then we ideally want to abort
immediately. This is particularly the case when there is a large
number of I/O related RPCs queued in the RPC layer, and the layout
segment gets invalidated due to an ENOSPC error, or an EACCES (because
the client was fenced). We may end up forced to spam the MDS with a
lot of otherwise unnecessary LAYOUTERRORs after that I/O fails.
