powerpc: Rename THREAD_INFO to TASK_STACK

This patch renames THREAD_INFO to TASK_STACK, because it is in fact
the offset of the pointer to the stack in task_struct so this pointer
will not be impacted by the move of THREAD_INFO.

Also make it available on 64-bit, as we'll need it there when we
activate THREAD_INFO_IN_TASK.
