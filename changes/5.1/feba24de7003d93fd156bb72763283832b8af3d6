drm/qxl: add mode/framebuffer check functions

Add a helper functions to check video modes.  Also add a helper to check
framebuffer buffer objects, using the former for consistency.  That way
we should not fail in qxl_primary_atomic_check() because video modes
which are too big will not be added to the mode list in the first place.
