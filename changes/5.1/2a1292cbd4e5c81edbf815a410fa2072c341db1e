perf report: Parse time quantum

Many workloads change over time. 'perf report' currently aggregates the
whole time range reported in perf.data.

This patch adds an option for a time quantum to quantisize the perf.data
over time.

This just adds the option, will be used in follow on patches for a time
sort key.
