locking/atomics: Check generated headers are up-to-date

Now that all the generated atomic headers are in place, it would be good
to ensure that:

b) developers don't directly modify the generated headers.

To ensure both of these properties, let's add a Kbuild step to check
that the generated headers are up-to-date.
