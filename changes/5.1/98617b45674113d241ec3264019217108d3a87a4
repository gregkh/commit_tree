media: imx-pxp: Start using the format VUYA32 instead of YUV32 (v2)

Buffers generated with YUV32 format seems to be incorrect, hence use
VUYA32 instead.

Changes from v1:
Add both formats VUYA32 and VUYX32 but associate only VUYX32 to the
output queue as the alpha channel of buffers is ignored on this queue.
