cifs: fix kref underflow in close_shroot()

Fix a bug where we used to not initialize the cached fid structure at all
in open_shroot() if the open was successful but we did not get a lease.
This would leave the structure uninitialized and later when we close the handle
we would in close_shroot() try to kref_put() an uninitialized refcount.

Fix this by always initializing this structure if the open was successful
but only do the extra get() if we got a lease.
This extra get() is only used to hold the structure until we get a lease
break from the server at which point we will kref_put() it during lease
processing.
