fat: enable .splice_write to support splice on O_DIRECT file

Now splice() on O_DIRECT-opened fat file will return -EFAULT, that is
because the default .splice_write, namely default_file_splice_write(),
will construct an ITER_KVEC iov_iter and dio_refill_pages() in dio path
can not handle it.

Fix it by implementing .splice_write through iter_file_splice_write().
