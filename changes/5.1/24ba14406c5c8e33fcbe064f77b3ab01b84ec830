route: Add multipath_hash in flowi_common to make user-define hash

Current fib_multipath_hash_policy can make hash based on the L3 or
L4. But it only work on the outer IP. So a specific tunnel always
has the same hash value. But a specific tunnel may contain so many
inner connections.

This patch provide a generic multipath_hash in floi_common. It can
make a user-define hash which can mix with L3 or L4 hash.
