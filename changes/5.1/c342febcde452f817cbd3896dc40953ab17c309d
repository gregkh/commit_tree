ASoC: soc-core: Fix probe deferral following prelink failure

Commit 78a24e10cd94 ("ASoC: soc-core: clear platform pointers on error")
re-worked the clean-up of any platform pointers that may have been
initialised by the function snd_soc_init_platform(). This commit missed
one error path where if any of the prelinks for a soundcard failed to
initialise, then these platform pointers would not be cleaned-up. This
then prevents the soundcard from being initialised following a probe
deferral when any of the soundcard prelinks cannot be found.

Fix this by ensuring that soc_cleanup_platform() is called when
initialising the soundcard prelinks fails.
