netfilter: fix NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_TEE dependencies

With NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_TEE=y and IP6_NF_IPTABLES=m, we get a link
error when referencing the NF_DUP_IPV6 module:

net/netfilter/xt_TEE.o: In function `tee_tg6':
xt_TEE.c:(.text+0x14): undefined reference to `nf_dup_ipv6'

The problem here is the 'select NF_DUP_IPV6 if IP6_NF_IPTABLES'
that forces NF_DUP_IPV6 to be =m as well rather than setting it
to =y as was intended here. Adding a soft dependency on
IP6_NF_IPTABLES avoids that broken configuration.
