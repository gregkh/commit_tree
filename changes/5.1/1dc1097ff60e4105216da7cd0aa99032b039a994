ext4: avoid panic during forced reboot

When admin calls "reboot -f" - i.e., does a hard system reboot by
directly calling reboot(2) - ext4 filesystem mounted with errors=panic
can panic the system. This happens because the underlying device gets
disabled without unmounting the filesystem and thus some syscall running
in parallel to reboot(2) can result in the filesystem getting IO errors.

This is somewhat surprising to the users so try improve the behavior by
switching to errors=remount-ro behavior when the system is running
reboot(2).
