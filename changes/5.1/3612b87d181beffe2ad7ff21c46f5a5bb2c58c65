watchdog: sbc60xxwdt: Mark expected switch fall-through

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warning:

drivers/watchdog/sbc60xxwdt.c: In function ‘fop_ioctl’:
drivers/watchdog/sbc60xxwdt.c:272:3: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
   wdt_keepalive();
   ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/watchdog/sbc60xxwdt.c:275:2: note: here
  case WDIOC_GETTIMEOUT:
  ^~~~

Notice that, in this particular case, the code comment is modified
in accordance with what GCC is expecting to find.

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
