arm64: KVM: Fix architecturally invalid reset value for FPEXC32_EL2

Due to what looks like a typo dating back to the original addition
of FPEXC32_EL2 handling, KVM currently initialises this register to
an architecturally invalid value.

As a result, the VECITR field (RES1) in bits [10:8] is initialised
with 0, and the two reserved (RES0) bits [6:5] are initialised with
1.  (In the Common VFP Subarchitecture as specified by ARMv7-A,
these two bits were IMP DEF.  ARMv8-A removes them.)

This patch changes the reset value from 0x70 to 0x700, which
reflects the architectural constraints and is presumably what was
originally intended.
