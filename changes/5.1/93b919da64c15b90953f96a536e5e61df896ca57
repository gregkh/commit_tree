debugfs: fix use-after-free on symlink traversal

symlink body shouldn't be freed without an RCU delay.  Switch debugfs to
->destroy_inode() and use of call_rcu(); free both the inode and symlink
body in the callback.  Similar to solution for bpf, only here it's even
more obvious that ->evict_inode() can be dropped.
