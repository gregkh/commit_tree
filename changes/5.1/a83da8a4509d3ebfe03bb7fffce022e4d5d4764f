scsi: sd: Optimal I/O size should be a multiple of physical block size

It was reported that some devices report an OPTIMAL TRANSFER LENGTH of
0xFFFF blocks. That looks bogus, especially for a device with a
4096-byte physical block size.

Ignore OPTIMAL TRANSFER LENGTH if it is not a multiple of the device's
reported physical block size.

To make the sanity checking conditionals more readable--and to
facilitate printing warnings--relocate the checking to a helper
function. No functional change aside from the printks.
