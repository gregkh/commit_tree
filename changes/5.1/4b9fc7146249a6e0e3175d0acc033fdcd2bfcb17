net: rds: exchange of 8K and 1M pool

Before the commit 490ea5967b0d ("RDS: IB: move FMR code to its own file"),
when the dirty_count is greater than 9/10 of max_items of 8K pool,
1M pool is used, Vice versa. After the commit 490ea5967b0d ("RDS: IB: move
FMR code to its own file"), the above is removed. When we make the
following tests.

Server:
  rds-stress -r 1.1.1.16 -D 1M

Client:
  rds-stress -r 1.1.1.14 -s 1.1.1.16 -D 1M

The following will appear.
"

   1    0    0     0.00     0.00     0.00    0.00 0.00 -1.00

"
So this exchange between 8K and 1M pool is added back.
