io_uring: support for IO polling

Add support for a polled io_uring instance. When a read or write is
submitted to a polled io_uring, the application must poll for
completions on the CQ ring through io_uring_enter(2). Polled IO may not
generate IRQ completions, hence they need to be actively found by the
application itself.

To use polling, io_uring_setup() must be used with the
IORING_SETUP_IOPOLL flag being set. It is illegal to mix and match
polled and non-polled IO on an io_uring.
