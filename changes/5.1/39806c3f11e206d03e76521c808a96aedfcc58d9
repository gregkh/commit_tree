drm/i915: Include register polling in reg_rw traces

We generally omit register polling from the i915_reg_rw tracepoint.
Understandable since polling could generate a lot of noise in the
trace. The downside is that the trace is incomplete. As a compromise
let's trace the final register value observed while polling. That
should be generally sufficient to observe what the code should be
doing next.

I suppose in some cases it might make sense to also trace the initial
register value, and maybe the number of times we polled. But that
would require a separate tracepoint so let's leave it for the future.

The other users of _NOTRACE() are i915_pmu and i2c bitbanging,
which I decided to leave alone.

Next we should do something to claw back the tracepoints for
planes and whatnot which were switched to _FW() a while back.
I guess just new macros for raw_rw+trace. The question is
what to call it?
