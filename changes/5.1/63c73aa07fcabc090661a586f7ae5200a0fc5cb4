KVM: VMX: Create a stack frame in vCPU-run

...in preparation for moving to a proper assembly sub-routnine.
vCPU-run isn't a leaf function since it calls vmx_update_host_rsp()
and vmx_vmenter().  And since we need to save/restore RBP anyways,
unconditionally creating the frame costs a single MOV, i.e. don't
bother keying off CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER or using FRAME_BEGIN, etc...
