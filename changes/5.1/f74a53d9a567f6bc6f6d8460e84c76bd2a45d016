tools: libbpf: add a correctly named define for map iteration

For historical reasons the helper to loop over maps in an object
is called bpf_map__for_each while it really should be called
bpf_object__for_each_map.  Rename and add a correctly named
define for backward compatibility.

Switch all in-tree users to the correct name (Quentin).
