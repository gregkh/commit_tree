usb: assign ACPI companions for embedded USB devices

USB devices permanently connected to USB ports may be described in ACPI
tables and share ACPI devices with ports they are connected to. See [1]
for details.

This will allow us to describe sideband resources for devices, such as,
for example, hard reset line for BT USB controllers.
