drm/i915: Remove GPU reset dependence on struct_mutex

Now that the submission backends are controlled via their own spinlocks,
with a wave of a magic wand we can lift the struct_mutex requirement
around GPU reset. That is we allow the submission frontend (userspace)
to keep on submitting while we process the GPU reset as we can suspend
the backend independently.

The major change is around the backoff/handoff strategy for performing
the reset. With no mutex deadlock, we no longer have to coordinate with
any waiter, and just perform the reset immediately.
