fuse: clean up fuse_writepage_in_flight()

Restructure the function to better separate the locked and the unlocked
parts.  Use the "old_req" local variable to mean only the queued request,
and not any auxiliary requests added onto its misc.write.next list.  These
changes are in preparation for the following patch.

Also turn BUG_ON instances into WARN_ON and add a header comment explaining
what the function does.
