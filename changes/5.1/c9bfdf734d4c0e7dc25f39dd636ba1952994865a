arm64: cpufeature: Set SYSREG_GIC_CPUIF as a boot system feature

It is not supported to have some CPUs using GICv3 sysreg CPU interface
while some others do not.

Once ICC_SRE_EL1.SRE is set on a CPU, the bit cannot be cleared. Since
matching this feature require setting ICC_SRE_EL1.SRE, it cannot be
turned off if found on a CPU.

Set the feature as STRICT_BOOT, if boot CPU has it, all other CPUs are
required to have it.
