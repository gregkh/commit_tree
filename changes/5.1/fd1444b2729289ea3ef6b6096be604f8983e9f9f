mm, compaction: ignore the fragmentation avoidance boost for isolation and compaction

When pageblocks get fragmented, watermarks are artifically boosted to
reclaim pages to avoid further fragmentation events.  However,
compaction is often either fragmentation-neutral or moving movable pages
away from unmovable/reclaimable pages.  As the true watermarks are
preserved, allow compaction to ignore the boost factor.

The expected impact is very slight as the main benefit is that
compaction is slightly more likely to succeed when the system has been
fragmented very recently.  On both 1-socket and 2-socket machines for
THP-intensive allocation during fragmentation the success rate was
increased by less than 1% which is marginal.  However, detailed tracing
indicated that failure of migration due to a premature ENOMEM triggered
by watermark checks were eliminated.
