ACPI / utils: Drop reference in test for device presence

When commit 8661423eea1a ("ACPI / utils: Add new acpi_dev_present
helper") introduced acpi_dev_present(), it missed the fact that
bus_find_device() took a reference on the device found by it and
the callers of acpi_dev_present() don't drop that reference.

Drop the reference on the device in acpi_dev_present().
