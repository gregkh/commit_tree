powerpc: 'current_set' is now a table of task_struct pointers

The table of pointers 'current_set' has been used for retrieving
the stack and current. They used to be thread_info pointers as
they were pointing to the stack and current was taken from the
'task' field of the thread_info.

Now, the pointers of 'current_set' table are now both pointers
to task_struct and pointers to thread_info.

As they are used to get current, and the stack pointer is
retrieved from current's stack field, this patch changes
their type to task_struct, and renames secondary_ti to
secondary_current.
