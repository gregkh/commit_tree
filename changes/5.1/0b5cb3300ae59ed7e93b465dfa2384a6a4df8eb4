RDMA/srp: Increase max_segment_size

The default behavior of the SCSI core is to set the block layer request
queue parameter max_segment_size to 64 KB. That means that elements of
scatterlists are limited to 64 KB. Since RDMA adapters support larger
sizes, increase max_segment_size for the SRP initiator.

Notes:
- The SCSI max_segment_size parameter was introduced in kernel v5.0. See
  also commit 50c2e9107f17 ("scsi: introduce a max_segment_size
  host_template parameters").
- Some other block drivers already set max_segment_size to UINT_MAX,
  e.g. nbd and rbd.
