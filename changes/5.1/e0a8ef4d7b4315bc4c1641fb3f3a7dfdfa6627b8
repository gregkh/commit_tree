brcmfmac: add basic validation of shared RAM address

While experimenting with firmware loading I ended up in a state of
firmware reporting shared RAM address 0x04000001. It was causing:
[   94.448015] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address cd680001
due to reading out of the mapped memory.

This patch adds some basic validation to avoid kernel crashes due to the
unexpected firmware behavior.
