mtd: spi-nor: cadence-quadspi: write upto 8-bytes data in STIG mode

cadence-quadspi controller allows upto eight bytes of data to
be written in software Triggered Instruction generator (STIG) mode
of operation. Lower 4 bytes are written through writedatalower and
upper 4 bytes by writedataupper register.

This patch allows all the 8 bytes to be written.
