Revert "KVM: MMU: zap pages in batch"

Unwinding optimizations related to obsolete pages is a step towards
removing x86 KVM's fast invalidate mechanism, i.e. this is one part of
a revert all patches from the series that introduced the mechanism[1].

This reverts commit e7d11c7a894986a13817c1c001e1e7668c5c4eb4.
