net: dsa: Add setter for SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_PORT_BRIDGE_FLAGS

In preparation for removing SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_PORT_BRIDGE_FLAGS_SUPPORT,
add support for a function that processes the
SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_PORT_BRIDGE_FLAGS and
SWITCHDEV_ATTR_ID_PORT_PRE_BRIDGE_FLAGS attributes and returns not
supported for any flag set, since DSA does not currently support
toggling those bridge port attributes (yet).
