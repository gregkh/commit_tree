loop: set GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN after blkdev_reread_part()

Commit 0da03cab87e6
("loop: Fix deadlock when calling blkdev_reread_part()") moves
blkdev_reread_part() out of the loop_ctl_mutex. However,
GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN is set before __blkdev_reread_part(). As a result,
__blkdev_reread_part() will fail the check of GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN and
will not rescan the loop device to delete all partitions.

Below are steps to reproduce the issue:

step1 # dd if=/dev/zero of=tmp.raw bs=1M count=100
step2 # losetup -P /dev/loop0 tmp.raw
step3 # parted /dev/loop0 mklabel gpt
step4 # parted -a none -s /dev/loop0 mkpart primary 64s 1
step5 # losetup -d /dev/loop0

Step5 will not be able to delete /dev/loop0p1 (introduced by step4) and
there is below kernel warning message:

[  464.414043] __loop_clr_fd: partition scan of loop0 failed (rc=-22)

This patch sets GENHD_FL_NO_PART_SCAN after blkdev_reread_part().
