ceph: handle the case where a dentry has been renamed on outstanding req

It's possible for us to issue a lookup to revalidate a dentry
concurrently with a rename. If done in the right order, then we could
end up processing dentry info in the reply that no longer reflects the
state of the dentry.

If req->r_dentry->d_name differs from the one in the trace, then just
ignore the trace in the reply. We only need to do this however if the
parent's i_rwsem is not held.
