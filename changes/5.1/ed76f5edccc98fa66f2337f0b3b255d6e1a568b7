net: sched: protect filter_chain list with filter_chain_lock mutex

Extend tcf_chain with new filter_chain_lock mutex. Always lock the chain
when accessing filter_chain list, instead of relying on rtnl lock.
Dereference filter_chain with tcf_chain_dereference() lockdep macro to
verify that all users of chain_list have the lock taken.

Rearrange tp insert/remove code in tc_new_tfilter/tc_del_tfilter to execute
all necessary code while holding chain lock in order to prevent
invalidation of chain_info structure by potential concurrent change. This
also serializes calls to tcf_chain0_head_change(), which allows head change
callbacks to rely on filter_chain_lock for synchronization instead of rtnl
mutex.
