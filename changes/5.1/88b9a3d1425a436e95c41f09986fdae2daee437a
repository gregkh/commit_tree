powerpc/smp: Fix NMI IPI xmon timeout

The xmon debugger IPI handler waits in the callback function while
xmon is still active. This means they don't complete the IPI, and the
initiator always times out waiting for them.

Things manage to work after the timeout because there is some fallback
logic to keep NMI IPI state sane in case of the timeout, but this is a
bit ugly.

This patch changes NMI IPI back to half-asynchronous (i.e., wait for
everyone to call in, do not wait for IPI function to complete), but
the complexity is avoided by going one step further and allowing new
IPIs to be issued before the IPI functions to all complete.

If synchronization against that is required, it is left up to the
caller, but current callers don't require that. In fact with the
timeout handling, callers must be able to cope with this already.
