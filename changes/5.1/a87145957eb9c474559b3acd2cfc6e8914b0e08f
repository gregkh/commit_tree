RDMA/bnxt_re: fix or'ing of data into an uninitialized struct member

The struct member comp_mask has not been initialized however a bit
pattern is being bitwise or'd into the member and hence other bit
fields in comp_mask may contain any garbage from the stack. Fix this
by making the bitwise or into an assignment.
