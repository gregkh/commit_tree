nfsd/nfsd3_proc_readdir: fix buffer count and page pointers

After this commit
  f875a79 nfsd: allow nfsv3 readdir request to be larger.
nfsv3 readdir request size can be larger than PAGE_SIZE. So if the
directory been read is large enough, we can use multiple pages
in rq_respages. Update buffer count and page pointers like we do
in readdirplus to make this happen.

Now listing a directory within 3000 files will panic because we
are counting in a wrong way and would write on random page.
