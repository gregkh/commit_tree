MAINTAINERS: Update filesystem-dax and NVDIMM entries

Ross has moved on to other areas.

Matthew and Jan are trusted reviewers for DAX.

Dan is now coordinating filesystem-dax pull requests.

Ira and Keith are now involved with the NVDIMM and Device-DAX
sub-systems.

The linux-nvdimm mailing hosts a patchwork instance for both DAX and
NVDIMM patches.
