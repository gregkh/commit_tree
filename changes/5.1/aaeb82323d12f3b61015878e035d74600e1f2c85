scsi: hisi_sas: print PHY RX errors count for later revision of v3 hw

The later revision of v3 hw has added an function of interrupt coalesce
according to time for PHY RX errors. We set the coalesce time to 1s.  Then
we print PHY RX errors count when PHY RX errors happen, and don't need to
worry that there may be too much log prints.

Besides, we use hisi_sas_phy.lock to protect error count value. Because we
update them by calling phy_get_events_v3_hw(), which is also used by core
driver (for get PHY events function).

We relocate phy_get_events_v3_hw() to avoid a further declaration.
