drm/i915: Drop fake breadcrumb irq

Missed breadcrumb detection is defunct due to the tight coupling with
dma_fence signaling and the myriad ways we may signal fences from
everywhere but from an interrupt, i.e. we frequently signal a fence
before we even see its interrupt. This means that even if we miss an
interrupt for a fence, it still is signaled before our breadcrumb
hangcheck fires, so simplify the breadcrumb hangchecking by moving it
into the GPU hangcheck and forgo fake interrupts.
