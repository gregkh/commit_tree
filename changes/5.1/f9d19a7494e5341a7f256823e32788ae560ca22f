net: atm: Use IS_ENABLED in atm_dev_ioctl

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

net/atm/resources.c:256:6: warning: variable 'number' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
net/atm/resources.c:212:7: warning: variable 'iobuf_len' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]

Clang won't realize that compat is 0 when CONFIG_COMPAT is not set until
the constant folding stage, which happens after this semantic analysis.
Use IS_ENABLED instead so that the zero is present at the semantic
analysis stage, which eliminates this warning.
