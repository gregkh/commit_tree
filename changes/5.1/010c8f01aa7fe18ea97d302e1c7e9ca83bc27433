net: Get rid of switchdev_port_attr_get()

With the bridge no longer calling switchdev_port_attr_get() to obtain
the supported bridge port flags from a driver but instead trying to set
the bridge port flags directly and relying on driver to reject
unsupported configurations, we can effectively get rid of
switchdev_port_attr_get() entirely since this was the only place where
it was called.
