selftests/bpf: add btf_dedup test for VOID equivalence check

This patch adds specific test exposing bug in btf_dedup_is_equiv() when
comparing candidate VOID type to a non-VOID canonical type. It's
important for canonical type to be anonymous, otherwise name equality
check will do the right thing and will exit early.
