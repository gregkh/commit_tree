sch_cake: Simplify logic in cake_select_tin()

With more modes added the logic in cake_select_tin() was getting a bit
hairy, and it turns out we can actually simplify it quite a bit. This also
allows us to get rid of one of the two diffserv parsing functions, which
has the added benefit that already-zeroed DSCP fields won't get re-written.
