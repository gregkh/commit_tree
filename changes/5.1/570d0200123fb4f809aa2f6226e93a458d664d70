driver core: move device->knode_class to device_private

As the description of struct device_private says, it stores data which
is private to driver core. And it already has similar fields like:
knode_parent, knode_driver, knode_driver and knode_bus. This look it is
more proper to put knode_class together with those fields to make it
private to driver core.

This patch move device->knode_class to device_private to make it comply
with code convention.
