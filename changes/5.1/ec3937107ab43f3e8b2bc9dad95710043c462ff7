x86/mm/KASLR: Fix the size of the direct mapping section

kernel_randomize_memory() uses __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT to calculate
the maximum amount of system RAM supported. The size of the direct
mapping section is obtained from the smaller one of the below two
values:

  (actual system RAM size + padding size) vs (max system RAM size supported)

This calculation is wrong since commit

  b83ce5ee9147 ("x86/mm/64: Make __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT always 52").

In it, __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT was changed to be 52, regardless of whether
the kernel is using 4-level or 5-level page tables. Thus, it will always
use 4 PB as the maximum amount of system RAM, even in 4-level paging
mode where it should actually be 64 TB.

Thus, the size of the direct mapping section will always
be the sum of the actual system RAM size plus the padding size.

Even when the amount of system RAM is 64 TB, the following layout will
still be used. Obviously KALSR will be weakened significantly.

   |____|_______actual RAM_______|_padding_|______the rest_______|
   0            64TB                                            ~120TB

Instead, it should be like this:

   |____|_______actual RAM_______|_________the rest______________|
   0            64TB                                            ~120TB

The size of padding region is controlled by
CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY_PHYSICAL_PADDING, which is 10 TB by default.

The above issue only exists when
CONFIG_RANDOMIZE_MEMORY_PHYSICAL_PADDING is set to a non-zero value,
which is the case when CONFIG_MEMORY_HOTPLUG is enabled. Otherwise,
using __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT doesn't affect KASLR.

Fix it by replacing __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT with MAX_PHYSMEM_BITS.
