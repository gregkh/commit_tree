parisc: Detect QEMU earlier in boot process

While adding LASI support to QEMU, I noticed that the QEMU detection in
the kernel happens much too late. For example, when a LASI chip is found
by the kernel, it registers the LASI LED driver as well.  But when we
run on QEMU it makes sense to avoid spending unnecessary CPU cycles, so
we need to access the running_on_QEMU flag earlier than before.

This patch now makes the QEMU detection the fist task of the Linux
kernel by moving it to where the kernel enters the C-coding.
