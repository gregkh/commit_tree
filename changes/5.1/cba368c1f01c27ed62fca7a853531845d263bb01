bpf: Only print ref_obj_id for refcounted reg

Naresh reported that test_align fails because of the mismatch at the
verbose printout of the register states.  The reason is due to the newly
added ref_obj_id.

ref_obj_id is only useful for refcounted reg.  Thus, this patch fixes it
by only printing ref_obj_id for refcounted reg.  While at it, it also uses
comma instead of space to separate between "id" and "ref_obj_id".
