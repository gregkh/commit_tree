usb: dwc3: Reset num_trbs after skipping

Currently req->num_trbs is not reset after the TRBs are skipped and
processed from the cancelled list. The gadget driver may reuse the
request with an invalid req->num_trbs, and DWC3 will incorrectly skip
trbs. To fix this, simply reset req->num_trbs to 0 after skipping
through all of them.
