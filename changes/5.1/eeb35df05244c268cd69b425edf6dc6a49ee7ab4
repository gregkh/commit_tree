PM / Domains: Mark "name" const in dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name()

As of the patch ("PM / Domains: Mark "name" const in
genpd_dev_pm_attach_by_name()") it's clear that the name in
dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name() can be const.  Mark it as so.  This
allows drivers to pass in a name that was declared "const" in a
driver.
