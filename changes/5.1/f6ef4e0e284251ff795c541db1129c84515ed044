ALSA: hda/realtek - Apply ALC294 hp init also for S4 resume

The init sequence for ALC294 headphone stuff is needed not only for
the boot up time but also for the resume from hibernation, where the
device is switched from the boot kernel without sound driver to the
suspended image.  Since we record the PM event in the device
power_state field, we can now recognize the call pattern and apply the
sequence conditionally.
