nvmem: core: Fix device reference leak

__nvmem_device_get() make use of bus_find_device() to get the relevant
device and this function increase the reference count of the device
found, however this is not accounted for anywhere. Fix
__nvmem_device_get() and __nvmem_device_put() to properly release this
reference count.
