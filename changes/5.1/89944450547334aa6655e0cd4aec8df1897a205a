IB/{hw,sw}: Remove 'uobject->context' dependency in object creation APIs

Now when we have the udata passed to all the ib_xxx object creation APIs
and the additional macro 'rdma_udata_to_drv_context' to get the
ib_ucontext from ib_udata stored in uverbs_attr_bundle, we can finally
start to remove the dependency of the drivers in the
ib_xxx->uobject->context.
