lightnvm: pblk: prevent stall due to wb threshold

In order to respect mw_cuinits, pblk's write buffer maintains a
backpointer to protect data not yet persisted; when writing to the write
buffer, this backpointer defines a threshold that pblk's rate-limiter
enforces.

On small PU configurations, the following scenarios might take place: (i)
the threshold is larger than the write buffer and (ii) the threshold is
smaller than the write buffer, but larger than the maximun allowed
split bio - 256KB at this moment (Note that writes are not always
split - we only do this when we the size of the buffer is smaller
than the buffer). In both cases, pblk's rate-limiter prevents the I/O to
be written to the buffer, thus stalling.

This patch fixes the original backpointer implementation by considering
the threshold both on buffer creation and on the rate-limiters path,
when bio_split is triggered (case (ii) above).
