drm/cirrus: add plane setup

Commit "f4bd542bca drm/fb-helper: Scale back depth to supported maximum"
uncovered a bug in the cirrus driver.  It must create its own primary
plane, using the correct format list, depending on the bpp module
parameter, so it is consistent with mode_config->preferred_depth.
