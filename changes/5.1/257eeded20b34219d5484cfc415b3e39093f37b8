net: Move all TC actions identifiers to one place

Move all the TC identifiers to one place, to the same enum that defines
the identifier of police action. This makes it easier choose numbers for
new actions since they are now defined in one place. We preserve the
original values for binary compatibility. New IDs should be added inside
the enum.
