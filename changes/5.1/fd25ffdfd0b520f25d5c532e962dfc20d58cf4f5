of: unittest: remove report of expected error

update_node_properties() reports an error when the test data contains
a node (such as "/aliases") that already exists in the base devicetree.
The error is caused by of_fdt_unflatten_tree() autogenerating the
"name" property, thus both the existing node and the new node will
have a property with the same name.  Suppress reporting the known
error.
