tipc: change to check tipc_own_id to return in tipc_net_stop

When running a syz script, a panic occurred:

[  156.088228] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in tipc_disc_timeout+0x9c9/0xb20 [tipc]
[  156.094315] Call Trace:

It was caused by the netns freed without deleting the discoverer timer,
while later on the netns would be accessed in the timer handler.

The timer should have been deleted by tipc_net_stop() when cleaning up a
netns. However, tipc has been able to enable a bearer and start d->timer
without the local node_addr set since Commit 52dfae5c85a4 ("tipc: obtain
node identity from interface by default"), which caused the timer not to
be deleted in tipc_net_stop() then.

So fix it in tipc_net_stop() by changing to check local node_id instead
of local node_addr, as Jon suggested.

While at it, remove the calling of tipc_nametbl_withdraw() there, since
tipc_nametbl_stop() will take of the nametbl's freeing after.

Fixes: 52dfae5c85a4 ("tipc: obtain node identity from interface by default")
