perf tools: Update x86's syscall_64.tbl, no change in tools/perf behaviour

To pick the changes in 7948450d4556 ("x86/x32: use time64 versions of
sigtimedwait and recvmmsg"), that doesn't cause any change in behaviour
in tools/perf/ as it deals just with the x32 entries.

This silences this tools/perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl'
  diff -u tools/perf/arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl arch/x86/entry/syscalls/syscall_64.tbl
