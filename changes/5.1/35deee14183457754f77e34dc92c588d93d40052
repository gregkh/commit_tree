media: sun6i: Add support for JPEG media bus format

The CSI controller can take raw data from the data bus and output it
directly to capture buffers. This can be used to support the JPEG media
bus format.

While the controller can report minimum and maximum bytes per line, it
has no way to report how many lines were captured in the last frame.
Thus, even when the on-bus data is framed correctly, we have no way to
accertain the actual amount of data captured, unless we scan the buffer
for JPEG EOI markers, or sequential zeros. For now we leave bytesused
alone, and leave it up to userspace applications to parse the data.
