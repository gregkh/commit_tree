drm: forward declare struct drm_file in drm_syncobj.h

drm_syncobj.h uses struct drm_file pointers, forward declare struct
drm_file to make the header self-contained. This prepares for dropping
drmP.h from files including drm_syncobj.h.

Switch from "" to <> includes while at it.

v2: forward declare instead of including drm_file.h (Daniel)
