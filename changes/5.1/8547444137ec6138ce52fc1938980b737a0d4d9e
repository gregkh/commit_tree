drm/i915: Identify active requests

To allow requests to forgo a common execution timeline, one question we
need to be able to answer is "is this request running?". To track
whether a request has started on HW, we can emit a breadcrumb at the
beginning of the request and check its timeline's HWSP to see if the
breadcrumb has advanced past the start of this request. (This is in
contrast to the global timeline where we need only ask if we are on the
global timeline and if the timeline has advanced past the end of the
previous request.)

There is still confusion from a preempted request, which has already
started but relinquished the HW to a high priority request. For the
common case, this discrepancy should be negligible. However, for
identification of hung requests, knowing which one was running at the
time of the hang will be much more important.
