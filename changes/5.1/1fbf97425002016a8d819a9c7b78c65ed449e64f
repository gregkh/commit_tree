scsi: lpfc: Convert ring number to hardware queue for nvme wqe posting.

SLI4 nvme functions are passing the SLI3 ring number when posting wqe to
hardware. This should be indicating the hardware queue to use, not the ring
number.

Replace ring number with the hardware queue that should be used.

Note: SCSI avoided this issue as it utilized an older lfpc_issue_iocb
routine that properly adapts.
