tools headers uapi: Sync asm-generic/mman-common.h and linux/mman.h

To deal with the move of some defines from asm-generic/mmap-common.h to
linux/mman.h done in:

  746c9398f5ac ("arch: move common mmap flags to linux/mman.h")

The generated mmap_flags array stays the same:

  $ tools/perf/trace/beauty/mmap_flags.sh
  static const char *mmap_flags[] = {
	[ilog2(0x40) + 1] = "32BIT",
	[ilog2(0x01) + 1] = "SHARED",
	[ilog2(0x02) + 1] = "PRIVATE",
	[ilog2(0x10) + 1] = "FIXED",
	[ilog2(0x20) + 1] = "ANONYMOUS",
	[ilog2(0x100000) + 1] = "FIXED_NOREPLACE",
	[ilog2(0x0100) + 1] = "GROWSDOWN",
	[ilog2(0x0800) + 1] = "DENYWRITE",
	[ilog2(0x1000) + 1] = "EXECUTABLE",
	[ilog2(0x2000) + 1] = "LOCKED",
	[ilog2(0x4000) + 1] = "NORESERVE",
	[ilog2(0x8000) + 1] = "POPULATE",
	[ilog2(0x10000) + 1] = "NONBLOCK",
	[ilog2(0x20000) + 1] = "STACK",
	[ilog2(0x40000) + 1] = "HUGETLB",
	[ilog2(0x80000) + 1] = "SYNC",
  };
  $

And to have the system's sys/mman.h find the definition of MAP_SHARED
and MAP_PRIVATE, make sure they are defined in the tools/ mman-common.h
in a way that keeps it the same as the kernel's, need for keeping the
Android's NDK cross build working.

This silences these perf build warnings:

  diff -u tools/include/uapi/asm-generic/mman-common.h include/uapi/asm-generic/mman-common.h
