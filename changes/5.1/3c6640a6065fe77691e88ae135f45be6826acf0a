media: imx: Allow interweave with top/bottom lines swapped

Allow sequential->interlaced interweaving but with top/bottom
lines swapped to the output buffer.

This can be accomplished by adding one line length to IDMAC output
channel address, with a negative line length for the interlace offset.

This is to allow the seq-bt -> interlaced-bt transformation, where
bottom lines are still dominant (older in time) but with top lines
first in the interweaved output buffer.

With this support, the CSI can now allow seq-bt at its source pads,
e.g. the following transformations are allowed in CSI from sink to
source:

seq-tb -> seq-bt
seq-bt -> seq-bt
alternate -> seq-bt
