leds: trigger: netdev: use memcpy in device_name_store

If userspace doesn't end the input with a newline (which can easily
happen if the write happens from a C program that does write(fd,
iface, strlen(iface))), we may end up including garbage from a
previous, longer value in the device_name. For example

# cat device_name

# printf 'eth12' > device_name
# cat device_name
eth12
# printf 'eth3' > device_name
# cat device_name
eth32

I highly doubt anybody is relying on this behaviour, so switch to
simply copying the bytes (we've already checked that size is <
IFNAMSIZ) and unconditionally zero-terminate it; of course, we also
still have to strip a trailing newline.

This is also preparation for future patches.
