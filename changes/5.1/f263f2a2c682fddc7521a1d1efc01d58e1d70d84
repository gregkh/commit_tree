MIPS: Compile post DMA flush only when needed

dma_sync_phys() is only called for some CPUs when a mapping is removed.
Add ARCH_HAS_SYNC_DMA_FOR_CPU only for the CPUs listed in
cpu_needs_post_dma_flush() which need this extra call and do not compile
this code in for other CPUs. We need this for R10000, R12000, BMIPS5000
CPUs and CPUs supporting MAAR which was introduced in MIPS32r5.

This will hopefully improve the performance of the not affected devices.
