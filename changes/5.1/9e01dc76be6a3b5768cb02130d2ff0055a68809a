KVM: arm/arm64: arch_timer: Assign the phys timer on VHE systems

VHE systems don't have to emulate the physical timer, we can simply
assign the EL1 physical timer directly to the VM as the host always
uses the EL2 timers.

In order to minimize the amount of cruft, AArch32 gets definitions for
the physical timer too, but is should be generally unused on this
architecture.
