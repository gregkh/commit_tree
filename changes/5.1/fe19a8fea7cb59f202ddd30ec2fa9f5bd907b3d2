ipvs: avoid indirect calls when calculating checksums

The function pointer ip_vs_protocol->csum_check is only used in protocol
specific code, and never in the generic one.
Remove the function pointer from struct ip_vs_protocol and call the
checksum functions directly.
This reduces the performance impact of the Spectre mitigation, and
should give a small improvement even with RETPOLINES disabled.
