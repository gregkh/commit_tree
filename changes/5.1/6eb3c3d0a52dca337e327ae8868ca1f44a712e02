exec: increase BINPRM_BUF_SIZE to 256

Large enterprise clients often run applications out of networked file
systems where the IT mandated layout of project volumes can end up
leading to paths that are longer than 128 characters.  Bumping this up
to the next order of two solves this problem in all but the most
egregious case while still fitting into a 512b slab.
