tools/bpf: print out btf log at LIBBPF_WARN level

Currently, the btf log is allocated and printed out in case
of error at LIBBPF_DEBUG level.
Such logs from kernel are very important for debugging.
For example, bpf syscall BPF_PROG_LOAD command can get
verifier logs back to user space. In function load_program()
of libbpf.c, the log buffer is allocated unconditionally
and printed out at pr_warning() level.

Let us do the similar thing here for btf. Allocate buffer
unconditionally and print out error logs at pr_warning() level.
This can reduce one global function and
optimize for common situations where pr_warning()
is activated either by default or by user supplied
debug output function.
