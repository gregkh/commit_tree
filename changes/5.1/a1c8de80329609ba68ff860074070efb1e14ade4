batman-adv: Add distributed_arp_table mesh genl configuration

The mesh interface can use a distributed hash table to answer ARP requests
without flooding the request through the whole mesh.

The BATADV_CMD_SET_MESH/BATADV_CMD_GET_MESH commands allow to set/get the
configuration of this feature using the
BATADV_ATTR_DISTRIBUTED_ARP_TABLE_ENABLED attribute. Setting the u8 to zero
will disable this feature and setting it to something else is enabling this
feature.
