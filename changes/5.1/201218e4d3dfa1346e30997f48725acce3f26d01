apparmor: delete the dentry in aafs_remove() to avoid a leak

Although the apparmorfs dentries are always dropped from the dentry cache
when the usage count drops to zero, there is no guarantee that this will
happen in aafs_remove(), as another thread might still be using it. In
this scenario, this means that the dentry will temporarily continue to
appear in the results of lookups, even after the call to aafs_remove().

In the case of removal of a profile - it also causes simple_rmdir()
on the profile directory to fail, as the directory won't be empty until
the usage counts of all child dentries have decreased to zero. This
results in the dentry for the profile directory leaking and appearing
empty in the file system tree forever.
