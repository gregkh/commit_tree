selftests: bpf: functional and min/max reasoning unit tests for JMP32

This patch adds unit tests for new JMP32 instructions.

This patch also added the new BPF_JMP32_REG and BPF_JMP32_IMM macros to
samples/bpf/bpf_insn.h so that JMP32 insn builders are available to tests
under 'samples' directory.
