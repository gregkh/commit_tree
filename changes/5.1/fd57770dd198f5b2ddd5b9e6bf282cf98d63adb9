net/smc: wait for pending work before clcsock release_sock

When the clcsock is already released using sock_release() and a pending
smc_listen_work accesses the clcsock than that will fail. Solve this
by canceling and waiting for the work to complete first. Because the
work holds the sock_lock it must make sure that the lock is not hold
before the new helper smc_clcsock_release() is invoked. And before the
smc_listen_work starts working check if the parent listen socket is
still valid, otherwise stop the work early.
