rcu: Consolidate PREEMPT and !PREEMPT synchronize_rcu_expedited()

The CONFIG_PREEMPT=n and CONFIG_PREEMPT=y implementations of
synchronize_rcu_expedited() are quite similar, and with small
modifications to rcu_blocking_is_gp() can be made identical.  This commit
therefore makes this change in order to save a few lines of code and to
reduce the amount of duplicate code.
