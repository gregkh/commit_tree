drivers: qcom: rpmh: avoid sending sleep/wake sets immediately

Fix the redundant call being made to send the sleep and wake requests
immediately to the controller.

As per the patch [1], the sleep and wake request votes are cached in
rpmh controller and sent during rpmh_flush(). These requests needs to be
sent only during entry of deeper system low power modes or suspend.
