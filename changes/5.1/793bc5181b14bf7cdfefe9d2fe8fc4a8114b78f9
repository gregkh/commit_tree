ext4: annotate more implicit fall throughs

There is a plan to build the kernel with -Wimplicit-fallthrough and
these places in the code produced warnings (W=1). Fix them up.

This commit remove the following warnings:

  fs/ext4/indirect.c:1182:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  fs/ext4/indirect.c:1188:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  fs/ext4/indirect.c:1432:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  fs/ext4/indirect.c:1440:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
