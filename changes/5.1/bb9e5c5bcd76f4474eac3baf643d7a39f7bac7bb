mac8390: Fix mmio access size probe

The bug that Stan reported is as follows. After a restart, a 16-bit NIC
may be incorrectly identified as a 32-bit NIC and stop working.

mac8390 slot.E: Memory length resource not found, probing
mac8390 slot.E: Farallon EtherMac II-C (type farallon)
mac8390 slot.E: MAC 00:00:c5:30:c2:99, IRQ 61, 32 KB shared memory at 0xfeed0000, 32-bit access.

The bug never arises after a cold start and only intermittently after a
warm start. (I didn't investigate why the bug is intermittent.)

It turns out that memcpy_toio() is deprecated and memcmp_withio() also
has issues. Replacing these calls with mmio accessors fixes the problem.
