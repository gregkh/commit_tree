  CHECK   drivers/acpi/acpi_configfs.c
drivers/acpi/acpi_configfs.c:100:31: warning: symbol 'acpi_table_bin_attrs' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/acpi/acpi_configfs.c:196:27: warning: symbol 'acpi_table_attrs' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/acpi/acpi_configfs.c:236:34: warning: symbol 'acpi_table_group_ops' was not declared. Should it be static?
