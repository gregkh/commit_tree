mfd / platform: cros_ec: Move device sysfs attributes to its own driver

The entire way how cros debugfs attibutes are created is broken.
cros_ec_sysfs should be its own driver and its attributes should be
associated with the sysfs driver not the mfd driver.

The patch also adds the sysfs documentation.
