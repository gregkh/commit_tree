drm: Fix drm_release() and device unplug

If userspace has open fd(s) when drm_dev_unplug() is run, it will result
in drm_dev_unregister() being called twice. First in drm_dev_unplug() and
then later in drm_release() through the call to drm_put_dev().

Since userspace already holds a ref on drm_device through the drm_minor,
it's not necessary to add extra ref counting based on no open file
handles. Instead just drm_dev_put() unconditionally in drm_dev_unplug().

We now have this:
- Userpace holds a ref on drm_device as long as there's open fd(s)
- The driver holds a ref on drm_device as long as it's bound to the
  struct device

When both sides are done with drm_device, it is released.
