HID: Increase maximum report size allowed by hid_field_extract()

Commit 71f6fa90a353 ("HID: increase maximum global item tag report size
to 256") increases the max report size from 128 to 256.

We also need to update the report size in hid_field_extract() otherwise
it complains and truncates now valid report size:
[ 406.165461] hid-sensor-hub 001F:8086:22D8.0002: hid_field_extract() called with n (192) > 32! (kworker/5:1)
