xfs: always check magic values in on-disk byte order

Most verifiers that check on-disk magic values convert the CPU
endian magic value constant to disk endian to facilitate compile
time optimization of the byte swap and reduce the need for runtime
byte swaps in buffer verifiers. Several buffer verifiers do not
follow this pattern. Update those verifiers for consistency.

Also fix up a random typo in the inode readahead verifier name.
