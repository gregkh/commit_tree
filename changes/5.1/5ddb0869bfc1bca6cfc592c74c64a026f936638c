leds: lp55xx: fix null deref on firmware load failure

I've stumbled upon a kernel crash and the logs
pointed me towards the lp5562 driver:

> <4>[306013.841294] lp5562 0-0030: Direct firmware load for lp5562 failed with error -2
> <4>[306013.894990] lp5562 0-0030: Falling back to user helper
> ...
> <3>[306073.924886] lp5562 0-0030: firmware request failed
> <1>[306073.939456] Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual address 00000000
> <4>[306074.251011] PC is at _raw_spin_lock+0x1c/0x58
> <4>[306074.255539] LR is at release_firmware+0x6c/0x138
> ...

After taking a look I noticed firmware_release()
could be called with either NULL or a dangling
pointer.
