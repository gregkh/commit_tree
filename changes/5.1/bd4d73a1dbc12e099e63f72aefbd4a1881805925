drm/savage: mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

drivers/gpu/drm/savage/savage_state.c:301:8: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
drivers/gpu/drm/savage/savage_state.c:438:8: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
drivers/gpu/drm/savage/savage_state.c:559:8: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
drivers/gpu/drm/savage/savage_state.c:697:8: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enabling
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
