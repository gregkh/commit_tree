drm/amd/display: don't call dm_pp_ function from an fpu block

Powerplay functions called from dm_pp_* functions tend to do a
mutex_lock which isn't safe to do inside a kernel_fpu_begin/end block as
those will disable/enable preemption.

Rearrange the dm_pp_get_clock_levels_by_type_with_voltage calls to make
sure they happen outside of kernel_fpu_begin/end.
