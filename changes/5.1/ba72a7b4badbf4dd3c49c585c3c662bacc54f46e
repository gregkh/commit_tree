selftests/bpf: test for BPF_F_LOCK

Add C based test that runs 4 bpf programs in parallel
that update the same hash and array maps.
And another 2 threads that read from these two maps
via lookup(key, value, BPF_F_LOCK) api
to make sure the user space sees consistent value in both
hash and array elements while user space races with kernel bpf progs.
