regulator: core: Drop lockdep annotation in drms_uA_update()

commit e5e21f70bfd3 ("regulator: core: Take lock before applying system
load") took the regulator lock before calling drms_uA_update() in order
to silence a lockdep warning during regulator_register().

However, we are not supposed to need locks at this point as the regulator
is in the process of being registered, so there should be no possibility
of concurrent access.

Instead, remove the unnecessary locking and simply drop the lockdep
annotation, since it is no longer valid.
