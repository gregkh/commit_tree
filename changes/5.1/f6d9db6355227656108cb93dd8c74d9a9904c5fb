kbuild: deb-pkg: avoid implicit effects

* The man page for dpkg-source(1) notes:

>      -b, --build directory [format-specific-parameters]
>             Build  a  source  package  (--build since dpkg 1.17.14).
>             <...>

  Thus it would be more foolproof to explicitly use 1.0 (as we always
  did) than to rely on dpkg-source's defaults.

* In a similar vein, debian/rules is not made executable by mkdebian,
  and dpkg-source warns about that but still silently fixes the file.
  Let's be explicit once again.
