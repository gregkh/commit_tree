mlxsw: core: Add API for QSFP module temperature thresholds reading

Add new API to read QSFP module's temperature thresholds - warning and
critical.

New internal API reads the temperature thresholds from the modules,
which are equipped with the thermal sensor. These thresholds will be
exposed via hwmon subsystem.
