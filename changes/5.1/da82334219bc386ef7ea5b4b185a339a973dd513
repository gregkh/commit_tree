IB/core: Allocate a bit for SRQ ODP support

The ODP support matrix is per operation and per transport. The support for
each transport (RC, UD, etc.) is described with a bit field.

ODP for SRQ WQEs is considered a different kind of support from ODP for RQ
WQs and therefore needs a different capability bit.
