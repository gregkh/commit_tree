lkdtm: Print real addresses

Today, when doing a lkdtm test before the readiness of the
random generator, (ptrval) is printed instead of the address
at which it perform the fault:

[ 1597.337030] lkdtm: Performing direct entry EXEC_USERSPACE
[ 1597.337142] lkdtm: attempting ok execution at (ptrval)
[ 1597.337398] lkdtm: attempting bad execution at (ptrval)
[ 1597.337460] kernel tried to execute user page (77858000) -exploit attempt? (uid: 0)
[ 1597.344769] Unable to handle kernel paging request for instruction fetch
[ 1597.351392] Faulting instruction address: 0x77858000
[ 1597.356312] Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]

If the lkdtm test is done later on, it prints an hashed address.

In both cases this is pointless. The purpose of the test is to
ensure the kernel generates an Oops at the expected address,
so real addresses needs to be printed. This patch fixes that.
