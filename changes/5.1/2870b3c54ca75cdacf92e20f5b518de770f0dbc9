gpio: pca953x: Use PCA_LATCH_INT

The commit 0cdf21b34e30

  ("gpio: pca953x: set the PCA_PCAL flag also when matching by DT")

introduces a helper macro which tells that chip supports latched interrupts,
but the macro was never used for ACPI or legacy enumeration.

So, make use of it for legacy and ACPI enumeration.
