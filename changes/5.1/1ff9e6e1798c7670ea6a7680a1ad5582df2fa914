mm: memcontrol: expose THP events on a per-memcg basis

Currently THP allocation events data is fairly opaque, since you can
only get it system-wide.  This patch makes it easier to reason about
transparent hugepage behaviour on a per-memcg basis.

For anonymous THP-backed pages, we already have MEMCG_RSS_HUGE in v1,
which is used for v1's rss_huge [sic].  This is reused here as it's
fairly involved to untangle NR_ANON_THPS right now to make it per-memcg,
since right now some of this is delegated to rmap before we have any
memcg actually assigned to the page.  It's a good idea to rework that,
but let's leave untangling THP allocation for a future patch.
