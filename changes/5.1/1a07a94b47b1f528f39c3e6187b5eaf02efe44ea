drm/sun4i: tcon top: Fix NULL/invalid pointer dereference in sun8i_tcon_top_un/bind

There are two problems here:

1. Not all clk_data->hws[] need to be initialized, depending on various
   configured quirks. This leads to NULL ptr deref in
   clk_hw_unregister_gate() in sun8i_tcon_top_unbind()
2. If there is error when registering the clk_data->hws[],
   err_unregister_gates error path will try to unregister
   IS_ERR()=true (invalid) pointer.

For problem (1) I have this stack trace:

Unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at virtual
  address 0000000000000008

Problem (2) was identified by head scratching.
