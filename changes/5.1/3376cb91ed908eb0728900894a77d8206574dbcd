powerpc/eeh: Cleanup eeh_pe_clear_frozen_state()

The 'clear_sw_state' parameter for eeh_pe_clear_frozen_state() is
redundant because it has no effect (except in the rare case of a
hardware error part way through unfreezing a tree of PEs, where it
would dangerously allow partial de-isolation before returning
failure).

It is passed down to __eeh_pe_clear_frozen_state(), and from there to
eeh_unfreeze_pe(), where it causes EEH_PE_ISOLATED to be removed
from the state of each PE during the traversal.  However, when the
traversal finishes, EEH_PE_ISOLATED is unconditionally removed by a
call to eeh_pe_state_clear() regardless of the parameter's value.

So remove the flag and pass false to eeh_unfreeze_pe() (to avoid the
rare case described above, as it was before the flag was introduced).
Also, perform the recursion directly in the function and eliminate a
bit of boilerplate.

There should be no change in functionality, except as mentioned above.
