btrfs: split btrfs_set_lock_blocking_rw to read and write helpers

There are many callers that hardcode the desired lock type so we can
avoid the switch and call them directly. Split the current function to
two but leave a helper that still takes the variable lock type to make
current code compile.  The call sites will be converted in followup
patches.
