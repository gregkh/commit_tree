net: phy: don't clear BMCR in genphy_soft_reset

So far we effectively clear the BMCR register. Some PHY's can deal
with this (e.g. because they reset BMCR to a default as part of a
soft-reset) whilst on others this causes issues because e.g. the
autoneg bit is cleared. Marvell is an example, see also thread [0].
So let's be a little bit more gentle and leave all bits we're not
interested in as-is. This change is needed for PHY drivers to
properly deal with the original patch.
