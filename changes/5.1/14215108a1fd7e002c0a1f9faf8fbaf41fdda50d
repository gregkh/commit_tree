net_sched: initialize net pointer inside tcf_exts_init()

For tcindex filter, it is too late to initialize the
net pointer in tcf_exts_validate(), as tcf_exts_get_net()
requires a non-NULL net pointer. We can just move its
initialization into tcf_exts_init(), which just requires
an additional parameter.

This makes the code in tcindex_alloc_perfect_hash()
prettier.
