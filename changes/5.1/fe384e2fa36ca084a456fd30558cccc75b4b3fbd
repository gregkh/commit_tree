net/sched: don't dereference a->goto_chain to read the chain index

callers of tcf_gact_goto_chain_index() can potentially read an old value
of the chain index, or even dereference a NULL 'goto_chain' pointer,
because 'goto_chain' and 'tcfa_action' are read in the traffic path
without caring of concurrent write in the control path. The most recent
value of chain index can be read also from a->tcfa_action (it's encoded
there together with TC_ACT_GOTO_CHAIN bits), so we don't really need to
dereference 'goto_chain': just read the chain id from the control action.
