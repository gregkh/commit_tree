cifs: replace snprintf with scnprintf

a trivial patch that replaces all use of snprintf with scnprintf.
scnprintf() is generally seen as a safer function to use than
snprintf for many use cases.

In our case, there is no actual difference between the two since we never
look at the return value. Thus we did not have any of the bugs that
scnprintf protects against and the patch does nothing.

However, for people reading our code it will be a receipt that we
have done our due dilligence and checked our code for this type of bugs.
