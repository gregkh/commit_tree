mlxsw: spectrum_router: Mark RIF index as taken before creation

The presence of an allocated RIF in mlxsw_sp->router->rifs[rif_index] marks
that rif_index as taken.
Set the marking of a taken RIF to happen before calling ops->create in
order to allow creation of a GRE underlay RIF, which may be allocated and
created as part of an overlay RIF creation.
