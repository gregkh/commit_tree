torture: Explain and simplify odd "for" loop in mkinitrd.sh

Why a Bourne-shell "for" loop?  And why 192 instances of "a"?  This commit
adds a shell comment to present the answer to these mysteries.  It also
uses a series of factor-of-four Bourne-shell assignments to make it
easy to see how many instances there are, replacing the earlier wall of
'a' characters.
