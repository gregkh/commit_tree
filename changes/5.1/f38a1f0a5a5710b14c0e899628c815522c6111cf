libbpf: handle BTF parsing and loading properly

This patch splits and cleans up error handling logic for loading BTF data.
Previously, if BTF data was parsed successfully, but failed to load into
kernel, we'd report nonsensical error code, instead of error returned from
btf__load(). Now btf__new() and btf__load() are handled separately with proper
cleanup and warning reporting.
