btrfs: check if there are free block groups for commit

may_commit_transaction will skip committing the transaction if we don't
have enough pinned space or if we're trying to find space for a SYSTEM
chunk.  However, if we have pending free block groups in this transaction
we still want to commit as we may be able to allocate a chunk to make
our reservation.  So instead of just returning ENOSPC, check if we have
free block groups pending, and if so commit the transaction to allow us
to use that free space.
