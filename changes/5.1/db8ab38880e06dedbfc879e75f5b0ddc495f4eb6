netfilter: nf_tables: merge ipv4 and ipv6 nat chain types

Merge the ipv4 and ipv6 nat chain type. This is the last
missing piece which allows to provide inet family support
for nat in a follow patch.

The kconfig knobs for ipv4/ipv6 nat chain are removed, the
nat chain type will be built unconditionally if NFT_NAT
expression is enabled.
