devlink: Add health reporter create/destroy functionality

Devlink health reporter is an instance for reporting, diagnosing and
recovering from run time errors discovered by the reporters.
Define it's data structure and supported operations.
In addition, expose devlink API to create and destroy a reporter.
Each devlink instance will hold it's own reporters list.

As part of the allocation, driver shall provide a set of callbacks which
will be used by devlink in order to handle health reports and user
commands related to this reporter. In addition, driver is entitled to
provide some priv pointer, which can be fetched from the reporter by
devlink_health_reporter_priv function.

For each reporter, devlink will hold a metadata of statistics,
dump msg and status.

For passing dumps and diagnose data to the user-space, it will use devlink
fmsg API.
