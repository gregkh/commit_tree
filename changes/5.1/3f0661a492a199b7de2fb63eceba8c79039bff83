scsi: target/core: Remove several state tests from the TMF code

Whether or not a session is being torn down does not affect whether or not
SCSI commands are in the task set. Hence remove the "tearing down" checks
from the TMF code. The TRANSPORT_ISTATE_PROCESSING check is left out
because it is now safe to wait for a command that is in that state. The
CMD_T_PRE_EXECUTE is left out because abort processing is postponed until
after commands have left the pre-execute state since the patch that makes
TMF processing synchronous.

See also commit 1c21a48055a6 ("target: Avoid early CMD_T_PRE_EXECUTE
failures during ABORT_TASK").
