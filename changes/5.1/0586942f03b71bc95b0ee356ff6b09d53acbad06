lightnvm: pblk: fix race condition on GC

This patch fixes a race condition where a write is mapped to the last
sectors of a line. The write is synced to the device but the L2P is not
updated yet. When the line is garbage collected before the L2P update
is performed, the sectors are ignored by the GC logic and the line is
freed before all sectors are moved. When the L2P is finally updated, it
contains a mapping to a freed line, subsequent reads of the
corresponding LBAs fail.

This patch introduces a per line counter specifying the number of
sectors that are synced to the device but have not been updated in the
L2P. Lines with a counter of greater than zero will not be selected
for GC.
