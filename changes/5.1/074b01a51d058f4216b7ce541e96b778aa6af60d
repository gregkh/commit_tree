rtc: Fix UBSAN overflow warning

Users may call 'ioctl' and pass a very big value on 'tm->tm_year'.
It can be overflowed in 'int' after add 1900.
In function 'rtc_month_days' and 'mktime64', also treated it as an
'unsigned' parameter.

UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in drivers/rtc/rtc-lib.c:103:59
signed integer overflow:
2147483647 + 1900 cannot be represented in type 'int'

UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in drivers/rtc/rtc-lib.c:119:30
signed integer overflow:
2147483647 + 1900 cannot be represented in type 'int'

So, covert it to 'unsigned' explicitly.
