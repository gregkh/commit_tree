perf script python: Add Python3 support to intel-pt-events.py

Support both Python2 and Python3 in the intel-pt-events.py script

There may be differences in the ordering of output lines due to
differences in dictionary ordering etc.  However the format within lines
should be unchanged.

The use of 'from __future__' implies the minimum supported Python2 version
is now v2.6
