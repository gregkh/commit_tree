netfilter: convert the proto argument from u8 to u16

The proto in struct xt_match and struct xt_target is u16, when
calling xt_check_target/match, their proto argument is u8,
and will cause truncation, it is harmless to ip packet, since
ip proto is u8

if a etable's match/target has proto that is u16, will cause
the check failure.

and convert be16 to short in bridge/netfilter/ebtables.c
