drm/i915: avoid division by zero on skl_calc_wrpll_link

If for some unexpected reason the registers all read zero it's better
to WARN and return instead of dividing by zero and completely freezing
the machine.

See commit 0e005888b833 ("drm/i915: avoid division by zero on
cnl_calc_wrpll_link") for detail.
