scsi: lpfc: Synchronize hardware queues with SCSI MQ interface

Now that the lower half has much better per-cpu parallelization using the
hardware queues, the SCSI MQ support needs to be tied into it.

The involves the following mods:

 - Use the hardware queue info from the midlayer to help select the
   hardware queue to utilize. This required change to the get_scsi-buf_xxx
   routines.

 - Remove lpfc_sli4_scmd_to_wqidx_distr() routine. No longer needed.

 - Includes fix for SLI-3 that does not have multi queue parallelization.
