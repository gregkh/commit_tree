drm/i915: Measure the required reserved size for request emission

Instead of tediously and fragilely counting up the number of dwords
required to emit the breadcrumb to seal a request, fake a request and
measure it automatically once during engine setup.

The downside is that this requires a fair amount of mocking to create a
proper breadcrumb. Still, should be less error prone in future as the
breadcrumb size fluctuates!
