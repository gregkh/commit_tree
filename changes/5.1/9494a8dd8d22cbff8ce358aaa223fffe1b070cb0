habanalabs: add h/w queues module

This patch adds the H/W queues module and the code to initialize Goya's
various compute and DMA engines and their queues.

Goya has 5 DMA channels, 8 TPC engines and a single MME engine. For each
channel/engine, there is a H/W queue logic which is used to pass commands
from the user to the H/W. That logic is called QMAN.

There are two types of QMANs: external and internal. The DMA QMANs are
considered external while the TPC and MME QMANs are considered internal.
For each external queue there is a completion queue, which is located on
the Host memory.

The differences between external and internal QMANs are:

1. The location of the queue's memory. External QMANs are located on the
   Host memory while internal QMANs are located on the on-chip memory.

2. The external QMAN write an entry to a completion queue and sends an
   MSI-X interrupt upon completion of a command buffer that was given to
   it. The internal QMAN doesn't do that.
