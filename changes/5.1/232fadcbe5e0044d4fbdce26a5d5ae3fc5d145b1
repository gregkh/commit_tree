drm/hisilicon/kirin: prepare for drmP.h removal from drm_modeset_helper.h

The use of drmP.h is discouraged and removal of it from
drm_modeset_helper.h caused kirin to fail to build.

This patch introduce the necessary fixes to prepare for the
drmP.h removal from drm_modeset_helper.h.
List of include files sorted alphabetically.

Build tested on arm x86 allmodconfig using the following hack
to the Kconfig file:

| -       depends on DRM && OF && ARM64
| +       depends on DRM && OF && (ARM64 || (X86_64 && COMPILE_TEST))

Build failed on 32bit ARM - so the X86_64 hack was required.
The COMPILE_TEST hack is not submitted as the preferred fix
is something where we have coverage on 32bit ARM too.
