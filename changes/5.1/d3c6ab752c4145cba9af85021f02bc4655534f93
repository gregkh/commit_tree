btrfs: make zstd memory requirements monotonic

It is possible based on the level configurations that a higher level
workspace uses less memory than a lower level workspace. In order to
reuse workspaces, this must be made a monotonic relationship. This
precomputes the required memory for each level and enforces the
monotonicity between level and memory required. This is also done
in upstream zstd in [1].
