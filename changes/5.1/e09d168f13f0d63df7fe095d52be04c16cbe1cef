gpio: AMD G-Series PCH gpio driver

GPIO platform driver for the AMD G-series PCH (eg. on GX-412TC)

This driver doesn't registers itself automatically, as it needs to
be provided with platform specific configuration, provided by some
board driver setup code.

Didn't implement oftree probing yet, as it's rarely found on x86.
