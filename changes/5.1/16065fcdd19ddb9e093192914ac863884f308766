drm/virtio: do NOT reuse resource ids

Bisected guest kernel changes crashing qemu.  Landed at
"6c1cd97bda drm/virtio: fix resource id handling".  Looked again, and
noticed we where not only leaking *some* ids, but *all* ids.  The old
code never ever called virtio_gpu_resource_id_put().

So, commit 6c1cd97bda effectively makes the linux kernel starting
re-using IDs after releasing them, and apparently virglrenderer can't
deal with that.  Oops.

This patch puts a temporary stopgap into place for the 5.0 release.
