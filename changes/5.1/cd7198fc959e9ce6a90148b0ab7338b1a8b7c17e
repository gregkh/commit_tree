docs: Use underscore not hyphen in label

sphinx emits warning

       WARNING: undefined label: memory-allocation ...

This seems to be caused by the use of a hyphen in the label name instead
of an underscore.  Using an underscore for the label name and the
reference clears the warning.

Use underscore not hyphen in label and reference.
