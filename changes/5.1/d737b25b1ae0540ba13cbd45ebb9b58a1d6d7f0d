IB/hfi1: Do not flush send queue in the TID RDMA second leg

When a QP is put into error state, the send queue will be flushed.
This mechanism is implemented in both the first and the second leg
of the send engine. Since the second leg is only responsible for
data transactions in the KDETH space for the TID RDMA WRITE request,
it should not perform the flushing of the send queue.

This patch removes the flushing function of the second leg, but
still keeps the bailing out of the QP if it is put into error state.
