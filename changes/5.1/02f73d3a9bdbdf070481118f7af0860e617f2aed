ath10k: fix descriptor size in ce tx completion for WCN3990

When the driver receives the tx completion of the
descriptor over ce, it clears the nbytes configured
for that particular descriptor. WCN3990 uses ce
descriptors with 64-bit address.

Currently during handling the tx completion of the
descriptors, the nbytes are accessed from the descriptors
using ce_desc for 32-bit targets. This will lead to clearing
of memory at incorrect offset if DMA MASK is set to greater
than 32 bits.

Attach different ce tx copy completed handler for targets
using address above 32-bit address.
