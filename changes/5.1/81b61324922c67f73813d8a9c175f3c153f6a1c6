powerpc/pseries: Perform full re-add of CPU for topology update post-migration

On pseries systems, performing a partition migration can result in
altering the nodes a CPU is assigned to on the destination system. For
exampl, pre-migration on the source system CPUs are in node 1 and 3,
post-migration on the destination system CPUs are in nodes 2 and 3.

Handling the node change for a CPU can cause corruption in the slab
cache if we hit a timing where a CPUs node is changed while cache_reap()
is invoked. The corruption occurs because the slab cache code appears
to rely on the CPU and slab cache pages being on the same node.

The current dynamic updating of a CPUs node done in arch/powerpc/mm/numa.c
does not prevent us from hitting this scenario.

Changing the device tree property update notification handler that
recognizes an affinity change for a CPU to do a full DLPAR remove and
add of the CPU instead of dynamically changing its node resolves this
issue.
