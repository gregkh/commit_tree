device core: Consolidate locking and unlocking of parent and device

Try to consolidate all of the locking and unlocking of both the parent and
device when attaching or removing a driver from a given device.

To do that I first consolidated the lock pattern into two functions
__device_driver_lock and __device_driver_unlock. After doing that I then
created functions specific to attaching and detaching the driver while
acquiring these locks. By doing this I was able to reduce the number of
spots where we touch need_parent_lock from 12 down to 4.

This patch should produce no functional changes, it is meant to be a code
clean-up/consolidation only.
