perf script python: Add Python3 support to netdev-times.py

Support both Python2 and Python3 in the netdev-times.py script

There may be differences in the ordering of output lines due to
differences in dictionary ordering etc.  However the format within lines
should be unchanged.

The use of 'from __future__' implies the minimum supported Python2
version is now v2.6.
