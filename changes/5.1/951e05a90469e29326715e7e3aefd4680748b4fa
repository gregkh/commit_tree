btrfs: Remove impossible condition from mergable_maps

We can never have extents marked as EXTENT_MAP_DELALLOC since this
value is only ever used by btrfs_get_extent_fiemap. In this case the
extent map is created by btrfs_get_extent_fiemap and is never really
published, this flag is used to return the corresponding userspace one.
Considering this, it's pointless having a check for EXTENT_MAP_DELALLOC
in mergable_maps. Just remove it.
