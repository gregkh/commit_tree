infiniband: prefix header search paths with $(srctree)/

Currently, the Kbuild core manipulates header search paths in a crazy
way [1].

To fix this mess, I want all Makefiles to add explicit $(srctree)/ to
the search paths in the srctree. Some Makefiles are already written in
that way, but not all. The goal of this work is to make the notation
consistent, and finally get rid of the gross hacks.

Having whitespaces after -I does not matter since commit 48f6e3cf5bc6
("kbuild: do not drop -I without parameter").
