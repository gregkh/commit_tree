mm/hugetlb: enable PUD level huge page migration

Architectures like arm64 have PUD level HugeTLB pages for certain configs
(1GB huge page is PUD based on ARM64_4K_PAGES base page size) that can
be enabled for migration.  It can be achieved through checking for
PUD_SHIFT order based HugeTLB pages during migration.
