crypto: x86/aesni-gcm - fix crash on empty plaintext

gcmaes_crypt_by_sg() dereferences the NULL pointer returned by
scatterwalk_ffwd() when encrypting an empty plaintext and the source
scatterlist ends immediately after the associated data.

Fix it by only fast-forwarding to the src/dst data scatterlists if the
data length is nonzero.

This bug is reproduced by the "rfc4543(gcm(aes))" test vectors when run
with the new AEAD test manager.
