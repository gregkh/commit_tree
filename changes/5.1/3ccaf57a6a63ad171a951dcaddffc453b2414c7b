XArray: Add support for 1s-based allocation

A lot of places want to allocate IDs starting at 1 instead of 0.
While the xa_alloc() API supports this, it's not very efficient if lots
of IDs are allocated, due to having to walk down to the bottom of the
tree to see if ID 1 is available, then all the way over to the next
non-allocated ID.  This method marks ID 0 as being occupied which wastes
one slot in the XArray, but preserves xa_empty() as working.
