cifs: Fix use-after-free in SMB2_read

There is a KASAN use-after-free:
BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in SMB2_read+0x1136/0x1190
Read of size 8 at addr ffff8880b4e45e50 by task ln/1009

Should not release the 'req' because it will use in the trace.

Fixes: eccb4422cf97 ("smb3: Add ftrace tracepoints for improved SMB3 debugging")
