RDMA: Handle PD allocations by IB/core

The PD allocations in IB/core allows us to simplify drivers and their
error flows in their .alloc_pd() paths. The changes in .alloc_pd() go hand
in had with relevant update in .dealloc_pd().

We will use this opportunity and convert .dealloc_pd() to don't fail, as
it was suggested a long time ago, failures are not happening as we have
never seen a WARN_ON print.
