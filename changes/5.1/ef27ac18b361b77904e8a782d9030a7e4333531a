lib/vsprintf.c: move sizeof(struct printf_spec) next to its definition

At the time of commit d048419311ff ("lib/vsprintf.c: expand field_width
to 24 bits"), there was no compiletime_assert/BUILD_BUG/....  variant
that could be used outside function scope.  Now we have static_assert(),
so move the assertion next to the definition instead of hiding it in
some arbitrary function.

Also add the appropriate #include to avoid relying on build_bug.h being
pulled in via some arbitrary chain of includes.
