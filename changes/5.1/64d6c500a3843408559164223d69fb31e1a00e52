drm/i915: Generalise GPU activity tracking

We currently track GPU memory usage inside VMA, such that we never
release memory used by the GPU until after it has finished accessing it.
However, we may want to track other resources aside from VMA, or we may
want to split a VMA into multiple independent regions and track each
separately. For this purpose, generalise our request tracking (akin to
struct reservation_object) so that we can embed it into other objects.

v2: Tweak error handling during selftest setup.
