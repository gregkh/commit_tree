dmaengine: xilinx_dma: autodetect whether the HW supports scatter-gather

The AXIDMA and CDMA HW can be either direct-access or scatter-gather
version. These are SW incompatible.

The driver can handle both versions: a DT property was used to
tell the driver whether to assume the HW is in scatter-gather mode.

This patch makes the driver to autodetect this information. The DT
property is not required anymore.

No changes for VDMA.
