block: add BLK_MQ_POLL_CLASSIC for hybrid poll and return EINVAL for unexpected value

For q->poll_nsec == -1, means doing classic poll, not hybrid poll.
We introduce a new flag BLK_MQ_POLL_CLASSIC to replace -1, which
may make code much easier to read.

Additionally, since val is an int obtained with kstrtoint(), val can be
a negative value other than -1, so return -EINVAL for that case.

Thanks to Damien Le Moal for some good suggestion.
