r8169: disable default rx interrupt coalescing on RTL8168

It was reported that re-introducing ASPM, in combination with RX
interrupt coalescing, results in significantly increased packet
latency, see [0]. Disabling ASPM or RX interrupt coalescing fixes
the issue. Therefore change the driver's default to disable RX
interrupt coalescing. Users still have the option to enable RX
coalescing via ethtool.
