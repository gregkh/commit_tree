vcs: fasync(): make it consistent with poll()

We use POLLPRI not POLLIN to wait for data with poll() as there is
never any incoming data stream per se. Let's use the same semantic
with fasync() for consistency, including the fact that a vt may go away.

No known user space ever relied on the SIGIO reason so far, let alone
FASYNC, so the risk of breakage is pretty much nonexistent.
