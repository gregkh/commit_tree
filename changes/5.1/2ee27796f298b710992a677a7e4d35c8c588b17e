x86/cpu/intel: Lower the "ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to normal" message's log priority

The "ENERGY_PERF_BIAS: Set to 'normal', was 'performance'" message triggers
on pretty much every Intel machine. The purpose of log messages with
a warning level is to notify the user of something which potentially is
a problem, or at least somewhat unexpected.

This message clearly does not match those criteria, so lower its log
priority from warning to info.
