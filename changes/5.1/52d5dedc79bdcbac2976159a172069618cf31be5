Revert "KVM: MMU: reclaim the zapped-obsolete page first"

Unwinding optimizations related to obsolete pages is a step towards
removing x86 KVM's fast invalidate mechanism, i.e. this is one part of
a revert all patches from the series that introduced the mechanism[1].

This reverts commit 365c886860c4ba670d245e762b23987c912c129a.
