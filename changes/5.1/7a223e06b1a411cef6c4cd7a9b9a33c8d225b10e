KVM: x86: avoid misreporting level-triggered irqs as edge-triggered in tracing

In __apic_accept_irq() interface trig_mode is int and actually on some code
paths it is set above u8:

kvm_apic_set_irq() extracts it from 'struct kvm_lapic_irq' where trig_mode
is u16. This is done on purpose as e.g. kvm_set_msi_irq() sets it to
(1 << 15) & e->msi.data

kvm_apic_local_deliver sets it to reg & (1 << 15).

Fix the immediate issue by making 'tm' into u16. We may also want to adjust
__apic_accept_irq() interface and use proper sizes for vector, level,
trig_mode but this is not urgent.
