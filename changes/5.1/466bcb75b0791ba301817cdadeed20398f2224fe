drm/amdgpu/psp: ignore psp response status

In some cases, psp response status is not 0 even there is no
problem while the command is submitted. Some version of PSP FW
doesn't write 0 to that field.
So here we would like to only print a warning instead of an error
during psp initialization to avoid breaking hw_init and it doesn't
return -EINVAL.
