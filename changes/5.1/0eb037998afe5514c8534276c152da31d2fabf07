ARM: oxnas: remove CPU hotplug implementation

The CPU hotplug implementation on this platform is cargo-culted from
the plat-versatile implementation, and is buggy.  Once a CPU hits the
"low power" loop, it will wait for pen_release to be set to the CPU
number to wake up again - but nothing in this implementation does that.

So, once a CPU has entered cpu_die() it will never, ever leave.

Remove this useless cargo-culted implementation.
