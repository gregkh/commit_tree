char/nvram: Adopt arch_nvram_ops

NVRAMs on different platforms and architectures have different attributes
and access methods. E.g. some platforms have byte-at-a-time accessor
functions while others have byte-range accessor functions. Some have
checksum functionality while others do not. By calling ops struct methods
via the common wrapper functions, the nvram module and other drivers can
make use of the available NVRAM functionality in a portable way.
