i40e: add tracking of AF_XDP ZC state for each queue pair

In commit f3fef2b6e1cc ("i40e: Remove umem from VSI") a regression was
introduced; When the VSI was reset, the setup code would try to enable
AF_XDP ZC unconditionally (as long as there was a umem placed in the
netdev._rx struct). Here, we add a bitmap to the VSI that tracks if a
certain queue pair has been "zero-copy enabled" via the ndo_bpf. The
bitmap is used in i40e_xsk_umem, and enables zero-copy if and only if
XDP is enabled, the corresponding qid in the bitmap is set and the
umem is non-NULL.
