net: phy: fix issue with loading PHY driver w/o initramfs

It was reported that on a system with nfsboot and w/o initramfs network
fails because trying to load the PHY driver returns -ENOENT. Reason was
that due to missing initramfs the modprobe binary isn't available.
So we have to ignore error code -ENOENT.
