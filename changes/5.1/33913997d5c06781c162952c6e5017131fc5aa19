fanotify: rename struct fanotify_{,perm_}event_info

struct fanotify_event_info "inherits" from struct fsnotify_event and
therefore a more appropriate (and short) name for it is fanotify_event.
Same for struct fanotify_perm_event_info, which now "inherits" from
struct fanotify_event.

We plan to reuse the name struct fanotify_event_info for user visible
event info record format.
