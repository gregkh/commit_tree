btrfs: change set_level() to bound the level passed in

Currently, the only user of set_level() is zlib which sets an internal
workspace parameter. As level is now plumbed into get_workspace(), this
can be handled there rather than separately.

This repurposes set_level() to bound the level passed in so it can be
used when setting the mounts compression level and as well as verifying
the level before getting a workspace. The other benefit is this divides
the meaning of compress(0) and get_workspace(0). The former means we
want to use the default compression level of the compression type. The
latter means we can use any workspace available.
