HID: logitech: Handle 0 scroll events for the m560

hidpp_scroll_counter_handle_scroll() doesn't expect a 0-value scroll event, it
gets interpreted as a negative scroll direction event. This can cause scroll
direction resets and thus broken scrolling.

Fixes: 4435ff2f09a2fc ("HID: logitech: Enable high-resolution scrolling on Logitech mice")
