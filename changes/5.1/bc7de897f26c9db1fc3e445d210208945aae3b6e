misc: hpilo: Exclude unsupported device via blacklist

Instead of having explicit if statements excluding devices,
use a pci_device_id table of devices to blacklist.

HPE will put out minor updates to the iLO using the same device
info except for the subsystem device id. hpilo driver takes the
approach to claim based upon {Vendor, Device, SubVendor} and it
allows old software to work on new hardware without patching.

As our primary way to support our customers is via distros, the
patching process could take months to go upstream and then
backported to multiple releases of multiple distros.

This approach worked fairly well as this is only the second time
in 10+ years that we need to blacklist an instance.
