media: adv748x: Implement TX link_setup callback

When the adv748x driver is informed about a link being created from HDMI or
AFE to a CSI-2 TX output, the 'link_setup()' callback is invoked. Make
sure to implement proper routing management at link setup time, to route
the selected video stream to the desired TX output.
