xfs: fix reporting supported extra file attributes for statx()

statx(2) notes that any attribute that is not indicated as supported by
stx_attributes_mask has no usable value. Commit 5f955f26f3d42d ("xfs: report
crtime and attribute flags to statx") added support for informing userspace
of extra file attributes but forgot to list these flags as supported
making reporting them rather useless for the pedantic userspace author.
