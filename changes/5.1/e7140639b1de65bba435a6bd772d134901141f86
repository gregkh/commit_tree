powerpc/xmon: Fix opcode being uninitialized in print_insn_powerpc

When building with -Wsometimes-uninitialized, Clang warns:

  arch/powerpc/xmon/ppc-dis.c:157:7: warning: variable 'opcode' is used
  uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is false
  [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
    if (cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTRS_POWER9))
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  arch/powerpc/xmon/ppc-dis.c:167:7: note: uninitialized use occurs here
    if (opcode == NULL)
        ^~~~~~
  arch/powerpc/xmon/ppc-dis.c:157:3: note: remove the 'if' if its
  condition is always true
    if (cpu_has_feature(CPU_FTRS_POWER9))
    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  arch/powerpc/xmon/ppc-dis.c:132:38: note: initialize the variable
  'opcode' to silence this warning
    const struct powerpc_opcode *opcode;
                                       ^
                                        = NULL
  1 warning generated.

This warning seems to make no sense on the surface because opcode is set
to NULL right below this statement. However, there is a comma instead of
semicolon to end the dialect assignment, meaning that the opcode
assignment only happens in the if statement. Properly terminate that
line so that Clang no longer warns.
