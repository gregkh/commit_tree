netfilter: nft_compat: use .release_ops and remove list of extension

Add .release_ops, that is called in case of error at a later stage in
the expression initialization path, ie. .select_ops() has been already
set up operations and that needs to be undone. This allows us to unwind
.select_ops from the error path, ie. release the dynamic operations for
this extension.

Moreover, allocate one single operation instead of recycling them, this
comes at the cost of consuming a bit more memory per rule, but it
simplifies the infrastructure.
