drm/i915/tv: Nuke reported_modes[]

Remove the silly reported_modes[] array. I suppse once upon a time
this actually had something to do with modes we reported to userspace.
Now it is just the placeholder for the mode we use for load detection.
We don't need it even for that, and instead we can just rely on
the fallback mode in intel_get_load_detect_pipe().
