selftests: kvm/evmcs_test: complete I/O before migrating guest state

Starting state migration after an IO exit without first completing IO
may result in test failures.  We already have two tests that need this
(this patch in fact fixes evmcs_test, similar to what was fixed for
state_test in commit 0f73bbc851ed, "KVM: selftests: complete IO before
migrating guest state", 2019-03-13) and a third is coming.  So, move the
code to vcpu_save_state, and while at it do not access register state
until after I/O is complete.
