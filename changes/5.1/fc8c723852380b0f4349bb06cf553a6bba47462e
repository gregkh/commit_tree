media: gpu: ipu-csi: Swap fields according to input/output field types

The function ipu_csi_init_interface() was inverting the F-bit for
NTSC case, in the CCIR_CODE_1/2 registers. The result being that
for NTSC bottom-top field order, the CSI would swap fields and
capture in top-bottom order.

Instead, base field swap on the field order of the input to the CSI,
and the field order of the requested output. If the input/output
fields are sequential but different, swap fields, otherwise do
not swap. This requires passing both the input and output mbus
frame formats to ipu_csi_init_interface().

Move this code to a new private function ipu_csi_set_bt_interlaced_codes()
that programs the CCIR_CODE_1/2 registers for interlaced BT.656 (and
possibly interlaced BT.1120 in the future).

When detecting input video standard from the input frame width/height,
make sure to double height if input field type is alternate, since
in that case input height only includes lines for one field.
