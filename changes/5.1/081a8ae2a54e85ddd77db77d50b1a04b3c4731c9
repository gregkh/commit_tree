xfs: fix uninitialized error variable

A previous commit removed the initialization of variable 'error' to zero,
and can cause a bogus error return.  This occurs when error contains a
non-zero garbage value and the call to xchk_should_terminate detects a
pending fatal signal and checks for a zero error before setting it
to -EAGAIN. Fix the issue by initializing error to zero.
