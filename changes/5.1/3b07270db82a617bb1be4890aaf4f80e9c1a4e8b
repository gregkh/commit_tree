selftests: tdc_batch.py: add options needed for concurrency tests

Extend tdc_batch.py with several optional CLI arguments that are used for
implementation of concurrency tests in following patches in this set:

- Add optional argument to specify range of filter handles used in batch
  file [fitler_handle, filter_handle+number). This is needed for testing
  filter deletion where it is necessary to know exact handles of configured
  filters.

- Add optional argument to specify filter operation type (possible values
  are ['add', 'del', 'replace']) instead of hardcoded "add" value. This
  allows generation of batches for filter addition, deletion and
  replacement.

- Add optional argument to allow user to change mac address prefix that is
  used for all filters in batch. This is necessary to allow generating
  multiple batches with unique flower classifier keys.
