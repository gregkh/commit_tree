media: v4l2-subdev.h: v4l2_subdev_call: use temp __sd variable

The sd argument of this macro can be a more complex expression. Since it
is used 5 times in the macro it can be evaluated that many times as well.

So assign it to a temp variable in the beginning and use that instead.

This also avoids any potential side-effects of evaluating sd.
