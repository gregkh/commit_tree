nvme-tcp: support C2HData with SUCCESS flag

A C2HData PDU with the SUCCESS flag set indicates that the I/O was
completed by the controller successfully and means that a subsequent
completion response capsule PDU will be ommitted.

If we see this flag, fisrt we check that LAST_PDU flag is set as well,
and then we complete the request when the data transfer (and data digest
verification if its on) is done.

While we're at it, reuse a bit of code with nvme_fail_request.
