PM / wakeup: Drop wakeup_source_drop()

After commit d856f39ac1cc ("PM / wakeup: Rework wakeup source timer
cancellation") wakeup_source_drop() is a trivial wrapper around
__pm_relax() and it has no users except for wakeup_source_destroy()
and wakeup_source_trash() which also has no users, so drop it along
with the latter and make wakeup_source_destroy() call __pm_relax()
directly.
