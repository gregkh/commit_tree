spi: omap2-mcspi: Fix DMA and FIFO event trigger size mismatch

Commit b682cffa3ac6 ("spi: omap2-mcspi: Set FIFO DMA trigger level to word length")
broke SPI transfers where bits_per_word != 8. This is because of
mimsatch between McSPI FIFO level event trigger size (SPI word length) and
DMA request size(word length * maxburst). This leads to data
corruption, lockup and errors like:

	spi1.0: EOW timed out

Fix this by setting DMA maxburst size to 1 so that
McSPI FIFO level event trigger size matches DMA request size.
