drm/irq: Ditch DRIVER_IRQ_SHARED

This is only used by drm_irq_install(), which is an optional helper.
For legacy pci devices this is required (due to interrupt sharing without
msi/msi-x), and just making this the default exactly matches the behaviour
of all existing drivers using the drm_irq_install() helpers. In case that
ever becomes wrong drivers can roll their own irq handling, as many
drivers already do (for other reasons like needing a threaded interrupt
handler, or having an entire pile of different interrupt sources).

v2: Rebase

v3: Improve commit message (Emil)
