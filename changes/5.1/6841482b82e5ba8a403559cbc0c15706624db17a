gpu: host1x: Set up stream ID table

In order to enable the MMIO path stream ID protection provided by the
incarnation of host1x found in Tegra186 and later, the host1x must be
provided with the list of stream ID register offsets for each of its
clients. Some clients (such as VIC) have multiple stream ID registers
that are assumed to be contiguous. The host1x is programmed with the
base offset and a limit which provide the range of registers that the
host1x needs to monitor for writes.
