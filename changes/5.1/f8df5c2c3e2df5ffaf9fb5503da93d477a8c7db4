USB: serial: option: set driver_info for SIM5218 and compatibles

The SIMCom SIM5218 and compatible devices have 5 USB interfaces, only 4
of which are serial ports.  The fifth is a network interface supported
by the qmi-wwan driver.  Furthermore, the serial ports do not support
modem control signals.  Add driver_info flags to reflect this.
