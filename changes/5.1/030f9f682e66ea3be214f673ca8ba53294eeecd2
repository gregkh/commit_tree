media: ov7670: control clock along with power

This provides more power saving when the sensor is off.

While at that, do the delay on power/clock enable even if the sensor driver
itself doesn't control the GPIOs. This is required for the OLPC XO-1
platform, that lacks the proper power/reset properties in its DT, but
needs the delay after the sensor is clocked up.
