xfs: move xfs_iomap_write_allocate to xfs_aops.c

This function is a small wrapper only used by the writeback code, so
move it together with the writeback code and simplify it down to the
glorified do { } while loop that is now is.

A few bits intentionally got lost here: no need to call xfs_qm_dqattach
because quotas are always attached when we create the delalloc
reservation, and no need for the imap->br_startblock == 0 check given
that xfs_bmapi_convert_delalloc already has a WARN_ON_ONCE for exactly
that condition.
