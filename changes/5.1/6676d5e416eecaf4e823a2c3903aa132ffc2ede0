net: sched: set dedicated tcf_walker flag when tp is empty

Using tcf_walker->stop flag to determine when tcf_walker->fn() was called
at least once is unreliable. Some classifiers set 'stop' flag on error
before calling walker callback, other classifiers used to call it with NULL
filter pointer when empty. In order to prevent further regressions, extend
tcf_walker structure with dedicated 'nonempty' flag. Set this flag in
tcf_walker->fn() implementation that is used to check if classifier has
filters configured.
