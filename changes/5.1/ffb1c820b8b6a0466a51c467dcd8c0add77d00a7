scsi: hisi_sas: remove the check of sas_dev status in hisi_sas_I_T_nexus_reset()

When issing a hardreset to a SATA device when running IO, it is possible
that abnormal CQs of the device are returned. Then enter error handler, it
doesn't enter function hisi_sas_abort_task() as there is no timeout IO, and
it doesn't set device as HISI_SAS_DEV_EH. So when hardreset by libata
later, it actually doesn't issue hardreset as there is a check to judge
whether device is in error.

For this situation, actually need to hardreset the device to recover.
So remove the check of sas_dev status in hisi_sas_I_T_nexus_reset().

Before we add the check to avoid the endless loop of reset for
directly-attached SATA device at probe time, actually we flutter it for
it, so it is not necessary to add the check now.
