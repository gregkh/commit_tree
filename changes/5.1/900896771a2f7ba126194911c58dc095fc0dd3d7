ALSA: fireface: add model-dependent parameter for address range to receive async transaction

In Fireface series, drivers can register destination address for
asynchronous transaction which transfers MIDI messages from device.

In former models, all of the transactions arrive at the registered
address without any offset. In latter models, each of the transaction
arrives at the registered address with sequential offset within 0x00
to 0x7f. This seems to be for discontinuity detection.

This commit adds model-dependent member for the address range.
