drm/i915: Use b->irq_enable() as predicate for mock engine

Since commit  d4ccceb05591 ("drm/i915/icl: Ringbuffer interrupt handling")
we have required a mechanism to avoid touching the interrupt hardware
for breadcrumbs, superseding our mock interface for selftests.

The residual problem (ideas welcome) is in probing the mock ring
registers for ring_is_idle. Hmm, maybe we should just install
mock handlers for i915->uncore.mmio__write and friends? Only problem
being is that we would to truly mock some expected reads. :(
