power: supply: isp1704: switch to gpiod API

This migrates isp1704 driver from old GPIO API to new descriptor
based GPIO API and drops useless platform data as a side-effect.

Migration is simple, since all mainline users are DT based and
DT API does not change. Out of tree users of the platform data
need to migrate to gpiod_lookup_table as described here:
