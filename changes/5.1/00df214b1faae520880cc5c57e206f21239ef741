Bluetooth: btrtl: Restore old logic to assume firmware is already loaded

Realtek bluetooth may not work after reboot:
[   12.446130] Bluetooth: hci0: RTL: rtl: unknown IC info, lmp subver a99e, hci rev 826c, hci ver 0008

This is a regression introduced by commit 26503ad25de8 ("Bluetooth:
btrtl: split the device initialization into smaller parts"). The new
logic errors out early when no matching IC info can be found, in this
case it means the firmware is already loaded.

So let's assume the firmware is already loaded when we can't find
matching IC info, like the old logic did.
