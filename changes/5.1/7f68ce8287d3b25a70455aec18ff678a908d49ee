pwm: rcar: Add support "atomic" API

This patch adds support for "atomic" API. This behavior differs with
legacy APIs a little.

 Legacy APIs:
  The PWMCNT register will be updated in rcar_pwm_config() even if
  the PWM state is disabled.

 Atomic API:
  The PWMCNT register will be updated in rcar_pwm_apply() only if
  the PWM state is enabled. Otherwize, if a PWM runs with 30% duty
  cycles and the pwm_apply_state() is called with state->enabled = 0,
  ->duty_cycle = 60 and ->period = 100, this is possible to output
  a 60% duty cycle.
