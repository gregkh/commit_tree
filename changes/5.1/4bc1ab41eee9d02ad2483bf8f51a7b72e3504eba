media: imx: csi: Stop upstream before disabling IDMA channel

Move upstream stream off to just after receiving the last EOF completion
and disabling the CSI (and thus before disabling the IDMA channel) in
csi_stop(). For symmetry also move upstream stream on to beginning of
csi_start().

Doing this makes csi_s_stream() more symmetric with prp_s_stream() which
will require the same change to fix a hard lockup.
