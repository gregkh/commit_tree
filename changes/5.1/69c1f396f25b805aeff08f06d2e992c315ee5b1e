efi/x86: Convert x86 EFI earlyprintk into generic earlycon implementation

Move the x86 EFI earlyprintk implementation to a shared location under
drivers/firmware and tweak it slightly so we can expose it as an earlycon
implementation (which is generic) rather than earlyprintk (which is only
implemented for a few architectures)

This also involves switching to write-combine mappings by default (which
is required on ARM since device mappings lack memory semantics, and so
memcpy/memset may not be used on them), and adding support for shared
memory framebuffers on cache coherent non-x86 systems (which do not
tolerate mismatched attributes).

Note that 32-bit ARM does not populate its struct screen_info early
enough for earlycon=efifb to work, so it is disabled there.
