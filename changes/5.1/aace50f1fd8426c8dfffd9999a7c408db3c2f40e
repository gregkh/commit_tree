media: dt-bindings: media: sun6i: Separate H3 compatible from A31

The CSI controller found on the H3 (and H5) is a reduced version of the
one found on the A31. It only has 1 channel, instead of 4 channels for
time-multiplexed BT.656. Since the H3 is a reduced version, it cannot
"fallback" to a compatible that implements more features than it
supports.

Split out the H3 compatible as a separate entry, with no fallback.
