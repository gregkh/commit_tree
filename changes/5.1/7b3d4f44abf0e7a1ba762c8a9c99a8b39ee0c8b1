platform/chrome: Add new driver for Wilco EC

This EC is an incompatible variant of the typical Chrome OS embedded
controller.  It uses the same low-level communication and a similar
protocol with some significant differences.  The EC firmware does
not support the same mailbox commands so it is not registered as a
cros_ec device type.  This commit exports the wilco_ec_mailbox()
function so that other modules can use it to communicate with the EC.
