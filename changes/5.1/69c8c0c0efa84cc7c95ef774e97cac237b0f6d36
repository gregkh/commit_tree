i2c: ocores: add polling interface

This driver assumes that an interrupt line is always available for
the I2C master. This is not always the case and this patch adds support
for a polling version.

Report from Andrew Lunn:

  I did some timing tests for this. On my box, we request a udelay of
  80uS. The kernel actually delays for about 79uS. We then spin in
  ocores_wait() for an additional 10-11uS, which is 3 to 4 iterations.

  There are actually 9 bits on the wire, not 8, since there is an
  ACK/NACK bit after the actual data transfer. So i changed the delay to
  (9 * 1000) / i2c->bus_clock_khz. That resulted in ocores_wait() mostly
  not looping at all. But for reading an 4K AT24 EEPROM, it increased
  the read time by 10ms, from 424ms to 434ms. So we should probably keep
  with 8.
