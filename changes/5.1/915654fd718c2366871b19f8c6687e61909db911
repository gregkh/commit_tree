samples/bpf: Fix dummy program unloading for xdp_redirect samples

The xdp_redirect and xdp_redirect_map sample programs both load a dummy
program onto the egress interfaces. However, the unload code checks these
programs against the wrong id number, and thus refuses to unload them. Fix
the comparison to avoid this.
