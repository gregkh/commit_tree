IB/mlx5: Fix the locking of SRQ objects in ODP events

QP and SRQ objects are stored in different containers so the action to get
and lock a common resource during ODP event needs to address that.

While here get rid of 'refcount' and 'free' fields in mlx5_core_srq struct
and use the fields with same semantics in common structure.
