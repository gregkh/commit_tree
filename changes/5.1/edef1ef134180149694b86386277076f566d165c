ACPI / CPPC: Fix guaranteed performance handling

As per the ACPI specification, "Guaranteed Performance Register" is
a "Buffer" field and it cannot be "Integer", so treat the "Integer"
type for "Guaranteed Performance Register" field as invalid and
ignore its value in that case.

Also save one cpc_read() call when "Guaranteed Performance Register"
is not present, which means a register defined as:
"Register(SystemMemory, 0, 0, 0, 0)".
