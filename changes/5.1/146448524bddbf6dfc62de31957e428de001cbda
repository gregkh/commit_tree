s390/jump_label: Use "jdd" constraint on gcc9

[heiko.carstens@de.ibm.com]:
-----
Laura Abbott reported that the kernel doesn't build anymore with gcc 9,
due to the "X" constraint. Ilya provided the gcc 9 patch "S/390:
Introduce jdd constraint" which introduces the new "jdd" constraint
which fixes this.
-----

The support for section anchors on S/390 introduced in gcc9 has changed
the behavior of "X" constraint, which can now produce register
references. Since existing constraints, in particular, "i", do not fit
the intended use case on S/390, the new machine-specific "jdd"
constraint was introduced. This patch makes jump labels use "jdd"
constraint when building with gcc9.
