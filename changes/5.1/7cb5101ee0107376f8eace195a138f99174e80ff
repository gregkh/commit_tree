habanalabs: prevent host crash during suspend/resume

This patch fixes the implementation of suspend/resume of the device so that
upon resume of the device, the host won't crash due to PCI completion
timeout.

Upon suspend, the device is being reset due to PERST. Therefore, upon
resume, the driver must initialize the PCI controller as if the driver was
loaded. If the controller is not initialized and the device tries to
access the device through the PCI bars, the host will crash with PCI
completion timeout error.
