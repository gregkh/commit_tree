tracing/syscalls: Pass in hardcoded 6 into syscall_get_arguments()

The only users that calls syscall_get_arguments() with a variable and not a
hard coded '6' is ftrace_syscall_enter(). syscall_get_arguments() can be
optimized by removing a variable input, and always grabbing 6 arguments
regardless of what the system call actually uses.

Change ftrace_syscall_enter() to pass the 6 args into a local stack array
and copy the necessary arguments into the trace event as needed.

This is needed to remove two parameters from syscall_get_arguments().
