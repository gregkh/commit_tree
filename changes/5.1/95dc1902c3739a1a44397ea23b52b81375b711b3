net/mlx5e: Don't inherit flow flags on peer flow creation

Currently the peer flow inherits the flags from the original flow
after we've set it. At this time the flags are set according to
the flow state, e.g marked as going to slow path and such.

Even if not getting us to real bugs now, this opens the door to
get us to troubles later. Future proof the code and avoid the
inheritance, use the peer flags as were set on input when we
started adding the original flow.
