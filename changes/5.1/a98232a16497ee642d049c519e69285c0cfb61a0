selftests: mlxsw: Add a test for blackhole routes

Use a simple topology consisting of two hosts directly connected to a
router. Make sure IPv4/IPv6 ping works and then add blackhole routes.
Test that ping fails and that the routes are marked as offloaded. Use a
simple tc filter to test that packets were dropped by the ASIC and not
trapped to the CPU.
