RDMA/nldev: Share with user-space object IDs

Give to the user space tools unique identifier for PD, MR, CQ and CM_ID
objects, so they can be able to query on them with .doit callbacks.

QP .doit is not supported yet, till all drivers will be updated to provide
their LQPN to be equal to their restrack ID.
