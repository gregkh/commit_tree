cifs: simplify how we handle credits in compound_send_recv()

Since we can now wait for multiple requests atomically in
wait_for_free_request() we can now greatly simplify the handling
of the credits in this function.

This fixes a potential deadlock where many concurrent compound requests
could each have reserved 1 or 2 credits each but are all blocked
waiting for the final credits they need to be able to issue the requests
to the server.

Set a default timeout of 60 seconds for compounded requests.
