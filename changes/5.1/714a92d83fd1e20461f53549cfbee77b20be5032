perf tools: Fix legacy events symbol separator parsing

Fixing legacy symbol events parsing. We can't support single slash
separator, like 'cycles/u', because it conflicts with non empty terms,
like 'cycles/period/u'.

Keeping only '//' and ':' separator for these events:
  cycles//u
  cycles:k

And removing '/' separator support, which is not working
anymore. Also adding automated tests for above events.
