xsk: fix umem memory leak on cleanup

When the umem is cleaned up, the task that created it might already be
gone. If the task was gone, the xdp_umem_release function did not free
the pages member of struct xdp_umem.

It turned out that the task lookup was not needed at all; The code was
a left-over when we moved from task accounting to user accounting [1].

This patch fixes the memory leak by removing the task lookup logic
completely.
