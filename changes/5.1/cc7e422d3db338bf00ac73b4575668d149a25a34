drm/amd/display: Don't re-enable CRC when CONFIG_DEBUG_FS isn't defined

[Why]
When CONFIG_DEBUG_FS isn't defined then amdgpu_dm_crtc_set_crc_source
is NULL. This causes a compilation error since it's being called
unconditionally.

[How]
Guard the call based on CONFIG_DEBUG_FS - CRC capture isn't supported
without this.
