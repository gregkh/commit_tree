drm/atomic-helper: Make atomic_enable/disable crtc callbacks optional

Allow atomic_enable and atomic_disable operations from
drm_crtc_helper_funcs struct optional. With this, the target display
drivers don't need to define a dummy function if they don't need one.

Changes since v2:
* Don't make funcs optional
* Update kerneldoc for atomic_enable/disable
* Replace "if (funcs->atomic_enable)" by "if (funcs->commit)"
* Improve commit message
