drm/i915: Pull GAMMA_MODE write out from haswell_load_luts()

For bdw+ let's move the GAMMA_MODE write for the legacy LUT
mode into the .load_luts() funciton directly, rather than
relying on haswell_load_luts(). We'll be getting rid of
haswell_load_luts() entirely soon, and it's anyway cleaner
to have the GAMMA_MODE write in a single place.
