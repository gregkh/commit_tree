net/smc: propagate file from SMC to TCP socket

fcntl(fd, F_SETOWN, getpid()) selects the recipient of SIGURG signals
that are delivered when out-of-band data arrives on socket fd.
If an SMC socket program makes use of such an fcntl() call, it fails
in case of fallback to TCP-mode. In case of fallback the traffic is
processed with the internal TCP socket. Propagating field "file" from the
SMC socket to the internal TCP socket fixes the issue.
