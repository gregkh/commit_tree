batman-adv: Fix genl notification for throughput_override

The throughput_override sysfs file is not below the meshif but below a
hardif. The kobj has therefore not a pointer which can be used to find the
batadv_priv data. The pointer stored in the hardif object must be used
instead to find the correct meshif private data.
