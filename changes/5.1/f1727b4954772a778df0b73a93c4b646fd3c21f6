KVM: nVMX: Capture VM-Fail to a local var in nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw()

Unlike the primary vCPU-run flow, the nested early checks code doesn't
actually want to propagate VM-Fail back to 'vmx'.  Yay copy+paste.

In additional to eliminating the need to clear vmx->fail before
returning, using a local boolean also drops a reference to 'vmx' in the
asm blob.  Dropping the reference to 'vmx' will save a register in the
long run as future patches will shift all pointer references from 'vmx'
to 'vmx->loaded_vmcs'.
