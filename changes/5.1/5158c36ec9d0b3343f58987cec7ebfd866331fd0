ihex: Check if zero-length record is at the end of the blob

When verifying the validity of IHEX file we need to make sure that
zero-length record we found is located at the end of the file. Not
doing that could result in an invalid file with a bogus zero-length in
the middle short-circuiting the check and being reported as valid.
