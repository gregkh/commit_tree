block: bounce: make sure that bvec table is updated

Block bounce needs to allocate new page for doing IO, and the
new page has to be updated to bvec table.

Commit 6dc4f100c switches __blk_queue_bounce() to use the new
bio_for_each_segment_all() interface. Unfortunately the new
bio_for_each_segment_all() can't be used to update bvec table.

This patch fixes this issue by retrieving bvec from the table
directly, then the new allocated page can be updated to the bio.
This way is safe because the cloned bio is single page bvec.

Fixes: 6dc4f100c ("block: allow bio_for_each_segment_all() to iterate over multi-page bvec")
