scsi: sd: Remove superfluous residual assignments

Since commit 26e85fcd15f6 ("[SCSI] sd: Permit merged discard requests";
kernel v3.10) sd_done() sets the residual not only for failed special
requests but also for special requests that succeeded. Hence remove the
code from functions called by sd_init_command() that sets the residual.
This patch does not change any functionality.
