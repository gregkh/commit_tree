mac80211: Fix kernel panic due to use of txq after free

The txq of vif is added to active_txqs list for ATF TXQ scheduling
in the function ieee80211_queue_skb(), but it was not properly removed
before freeing the txq object. It was causing use after free of the txq
objects from the active_txqs list, result was kernel panic
due to invalid memory access.

Fix kernel invalid memory access by properly removing txq object
from active_txqs list before free the object.
