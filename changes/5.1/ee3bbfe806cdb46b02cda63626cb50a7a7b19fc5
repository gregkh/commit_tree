net/sched: let actions use RCU to access 'goto_chain'

use RCU when accessing the action chain, to avoid use after free in the
traffic path when 'goto chain' is replaced on existing TC actions (see
script below). Since the control action is read in the traffic path
without holding the action spinlock, we need to explicitly ensure that
a->goto_chain is not NULL before dereferencing (i.e it's not sufficient
to rely on the value of TC_ACT_GOTO_CHAIN bits). Not doing so caused NULL
dereferences in tcf_action_goto_chain_exec() when the following script:

 # tc chain add dev dd0 chain 42 ingress protocol ip flower \
 > ip_proto udp action pass index 4
 # tc filter add dev dd0 ingress protocol ip flower \
 > ip_proto udp action csum udp goto chain 42 index 66
 # tc chain del dev dd0 chain 42 ingress
 (start UDP traffic towards dd0)
 # tc action replace action csum udp pass index 66

was run repeatedly for several hours.
