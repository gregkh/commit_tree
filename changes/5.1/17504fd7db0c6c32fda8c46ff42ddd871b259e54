vt: annotate implicit fall throughs

There is a plan to build the kernel with -Wimplicit-fallthrough and
these places in the code produced warnings (W=1). Fix them up.

This commit remove the following warning:

  drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:2112:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  drivers/tty/vt/vt.c:2237:6: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
