xfs: clarify documentation for the function to reverify buffers

Improve the documentation around xfs_buf_ensure_ops, which is the
function that is responsible for cleaning up the b_ops state of buffers
that go through xrep_findroot_block but don't match anything.  Rename
the function to xfs_buf_reverify.

[darrick: this started off as bfoster mods of a previous patch of mine,
but the renaming part is now this separate patch.]
