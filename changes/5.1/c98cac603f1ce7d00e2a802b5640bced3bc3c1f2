rcu: Rename rcu_check_callbacks() to rcu_sched_clock_irq()

The name rcu_check_callbacks() arguably made sense back in the early
2000s when RCU was quite a bit simpler than it is today, but it has
become quite misleading, especially with the advent of dyntick-idle
and NO_HZ_FULL.  The rcu_check_callbacks() function is RCU's hook into
the scheduling-clock interrupt, and is now but one of many ways that
callbacks get promoted to invocable state.

This commit therefore changes the name to rcu_sched_clock_irq(),
which is the same number of characters and clearly indicates this
function's relation to the rest of the Linux kernel.  In addition, for
the sake of consistency, rcu_flavor_check_callbacks() is also renamed
to rcu_flavor_sched_clock_irq().

While in the area, the header comments for both functions are reworked.
