Revert "selftests: firmware: add CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK to config"

This reverts commit 7492902e8d22b568463897fa967c0886764cf034.

The commit tried to address an issue discovered by Dan where he got
a message saying:

'usermode helper disabled so ignoring test'.

Dans's commit is forcing CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK but just
having CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER suffices to emulate the_FALLBACK
functionality.

Dan's commit is trying to fix an issue which is hidden from a previous
commit. That issue will be addressed properly next.
