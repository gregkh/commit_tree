netfilter: nat: merge nf_nat_ipv4,6 into nat core

before:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  16566    1576    4136   22278    5706 nf_nat.ko
   3598	    844	      0	   4442	   115a	nf_nat_ipv6.ko
   3187	    844	      0	   4031	    fbf	nf_nat_ipv4.ko

after:
   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  22948    1612    4136   28696    7018 nf_nat.ko

... with ipv4/v6 nat now provided directly via nf_nat.ko.

Also changes:
       ret = nf_nat_ipv4_fn(priv, skb, state);
       if (ret != NF_DROP && ret != NF_STOLEN &&
into
	if (ret != NF_ACCEPT)
		return ret;

everywhere.

The nat hooks never should return anything other than
ACCEPT or DROP (and the latter only in rare error cases).

The original code uses multi-line ANDing including assignment-in-if:
        if (ret != NF_DROP && ret != NF_STOLEN &&
           !(IPCB(skb)->flags & IPSKB_XFRM_TRANSFORMED) &&
            (ct = nf_ct_get(skb, &ctinfo)) != NULL) {

I removed this while moving, breaking those in separate conditionals
and moving the assignments into extra lines.

checkpatch still generates some warnings:
 1. Overly long lines (of moved code).
    Breaking them is even more ugly. so I kept this as-is.
 2. use of extern function declarations in a .c file.
    This is necessary evil, we must call
    nf_nat_l3proto_register() from the nat core now.
    All l3proto related functions are removed later in this series,
    those prototypes are then removed as well.

v2: keep empty nf_nat_ipv6_csum_update stub for CONFIG_IPV6=n case.
v3: remove IS_ENABLED(NF_NAT_IPV4/6) tests, NF_NAT_IPVx toggles
    are removed here.
v4: also get rid of the assignments in conditionals.
