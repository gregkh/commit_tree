net_sched: return correct value for *notify* functions

It is confusing to directly use return value of netlink_send()/
netlink_unicast() as the return value of *notify*, as it may be not
error at all.

Example: in tc_del_tfilter(), after calling tfilter_del_notify(), it will
goto errout if (err). However, the netlink_send()/netlink_unicast() will
return positive value even for successful case. So it may not call
tcf_chain_tp_remove() and so on to clean up the resource, as a result,
resource is leaked.

It may be easier to only check the return value of tfilter_del_nofiy(),
but it is more clean to correct all related functions.
