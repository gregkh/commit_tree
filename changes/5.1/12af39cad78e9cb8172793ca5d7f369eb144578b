ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: disable ick autoidling when a hwmod requires that

Deny autoidle for hwmods with the OCPIF_SWSUP_IDLE flag,
that makes hwmods working properly which cannot handle
autoidle properly in lower power states.
Affected is e. g. the omap_hdq.
Since an ick might have mulitple users, autoidle is disabled
when an individual user requires that rather than in
_setup_iclk_autoidle. dss_ick is an example for that.
