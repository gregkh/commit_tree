net/smc: unlock LGR pending lock earlier for SMC-D

If SMC client and server connections are both established at the same
time, smc_connect_ism() cannot send a CLC confirm message while
smc_listen_work() is waiting for one due to lock contention. This can
result in timeouts in smc_clc_wait_msg() and failed SMC connections.

In case of SMC-D, the LGR pending lock is not needed while
smc_listen_work() is waiting for the CLC confirm message. So, this patch
releases the lock earlier for SMC-D to avoid the locking issue.
