bna: Mark expected switch fall-throughs

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch cases
where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warnings:

drivers/net/ethernet/brocade/bna/bfa_ioc.c:790:3: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
drivers/net/ethernet/brocade/bna/bfa_ioc.c:860:3: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enabling
-Wimplicit-fallthrough
