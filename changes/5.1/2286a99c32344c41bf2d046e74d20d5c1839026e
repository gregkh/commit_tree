iwlwifi: mvm: fix HE radiotap data4 for HE-TB PPDUs

In HE-TB PPDUs (labeled HE-TRIG in radiotap), we were overwriting
the data4.spatial_reuse_1 field with the spatial reuse data that
the firmware gives us for SU/MU PPDUs. Fix that by moving that,
we are already setting the data4.spatial_reuse_{1,2,3,4} fields
in the TB PPDU case.
