btrfs: drop the lock on error in btrfs_dev_replace_cancel

We should drop the lock on this error path.  This has been found by a
static tool.

The lock needs to be released, it's there to protect access to the
dev_replace members and is not supposed to be left locked. The value of
state that's being switched would need to be artifically changed to an
invalid value so the default: branch is taken.

Fixes: d189dd70e255 ("btrfs: fix use-after-free due to race between replace start and cancel")
