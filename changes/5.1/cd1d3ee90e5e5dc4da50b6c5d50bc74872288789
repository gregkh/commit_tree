drm/i915: Use intel_ types more consistently for watermark code (v2)

Try to be more consistent about intel_* types rather than drm_* types
for lower-level driver functions.

v2:
 - Also drop the intel_crtc parameter from compute_intermediate_wm()
   since we can just extract it from the crtc_state parameter. (Ville)
