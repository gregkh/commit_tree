ntb_hw_switchtec: Added support of >=4G memory windows

Current Switchtec's BAR setup registers are limited to 32bits,
corresponding to the maximum MW (memory window) size is <4G.

Increase the MW sizes with the addition of the BAR Setup Extension
Register for the upper 32bits of a 64bits MW size. This increases the MW
range to between 4K and 2^63.
