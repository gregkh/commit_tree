RDMA/bnxt_re: Enable GSI QP support for 57500 series

In the new 57500 series of adapters the GSI qp is a UD type QP unlike the
previous generation where it was a Raw Eth QP. Changing the control and
data path to support the same. Listing all the significant diffs:

 - AH creation resolve network type unconditionally
 - Add check at relevant places to distinguish from Raw Eth
   processing flow.
 - bnxt_re_process_res_ud_wc report completion with GRH flag
   when qp is GSI.
 - Change length, cfa_meta and smac to match new driver/hardware
   interface.
 - Add new driver/hardware interface.
