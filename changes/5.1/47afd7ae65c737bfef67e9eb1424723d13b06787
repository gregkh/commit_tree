pstore/ram: Add kmsg hlen zero check to ramoops_pstore_write()

If zero-length header happened in ramoops_write_kmsg_hdr(), that means
we will not be able to read back dmesg record later, since it will be
treated as invalid header in ramoops_pstore_read(). So we should not
execute the following code but return the error.
