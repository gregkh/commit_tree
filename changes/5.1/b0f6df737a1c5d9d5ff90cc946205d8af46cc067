cifs: cache FILE_ALL_INFO for the shared root handle

When we open the shared root handle also ask for FILE_ALL_INFORMATION since
we can do this at zero cost as part of a compound.
Cache this information as long as the lease is held and return and serve any
future requests from cache.

This allows us to serve "stat /<mountpoint>" directly from cache and avoid
a network roundtrip.  Since clients often want to do this quite a lot
this improve performance slightly.

As an example: xfstest generic/533 performs 43 stat operations on the root
of the share while it is run. Which are eliminated with this patch.
