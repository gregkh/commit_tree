ASoC: ak4458: Add support for AK4497

AK4497 is a 32-bit 2ch DAC and has the same register
map as AK4458 with few exceptions:

* AK4497 has one more register at the end of register space
  DFS_READ which is a read only register that allows users
  to read FS Auto Detection mode. We currently do not use
  this register so we use the same regmap structure as for ak4458.

* Because AK4458 is an 8ch DAC there are some fields that are
  only used by AK4458 and marked as reserved for AK4497, so for
  this reason we need to have a distinct set of controls, widgets
  and routes.
