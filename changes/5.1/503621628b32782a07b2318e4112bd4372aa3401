ARM: fix function graph tracer and unwinder dependencies

Naresh Kamboju recently reported that the function-graph tracer crashes
on ARM. The function-graph tracer assumes that the kernel is built with
frame pointers.

We explicitly disabled the function-graph tracer when building Thumb2,
since the Thumb2 ABI doesn't have frame pointers.

We recently changed the way the unwinder method was selected, which
seems to have made it more likely that we can end up with the function-
graph tracer enabled but without the kernel built with frame pointers.

Fix up the function graph tracer dependencies so the option is not
available when we have no possibility of having frame pointers, and
adjust the dependencies on the unwinder option to hide the non-frame
pointer unwinder options if the function-graph tracer is enabled.
