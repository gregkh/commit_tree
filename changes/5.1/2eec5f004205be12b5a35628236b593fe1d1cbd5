btrfs: let the assertion expression compile in all configs

A compiler warning (in a patch in development) pointed to a variable
that was used only inside and ASSERT:

  u64 root_objectid = root->root_key.objectid;
  ASSERT(root_objectid == ...);

  fs/btrfs/relocation.c: In function ‘insert_dirty_subv’:
  fs/btrfs/relocation.c:2138:6: warning: unused variable ‘root_objectid’ [-Wunused-variable]
    u64 root_objectid = root->root_key.objectid;
	^~~~~~~~~~~~~

When CONFIG_BRTFS_ASSERT isn't enabled, variable root_objectid isn't used.

Rework the assertion helper by adding a runtime check instead of the
'#ifdef CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT #else ...", so the compiler sees the
condition being passed into an inline function after preprocessing.
