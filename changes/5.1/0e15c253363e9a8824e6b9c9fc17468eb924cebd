drivers/IB,hfi1: do not se mmap_sem

This driver already uses gup_fast() and thus we can just drop the mmap_sem
protection around the pinned_vm counter. Note that the window between when
hfi1_can_pin_pages() is called and the actual counter is incremented
remains the same as mmap_sem was _only_ used for when ->pinned_vm was
touched.
