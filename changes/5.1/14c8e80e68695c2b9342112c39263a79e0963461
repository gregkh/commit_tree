media: v4l: ioctl: Sanitize num_planes before using it

The linked commit changed s_fmt/try_fmt to fail if num_planes is bogus.
This, however, is against the spec, which mandates drivers
to return a proper num_planes value, without an error.

Replace the num_planes check and instead clamp it to a sane value,
so we still make sure we don't overflow the planes array by accident.
