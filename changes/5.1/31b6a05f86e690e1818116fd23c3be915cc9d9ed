scsi: megaraid_sas: reduce module load time

megaraid_sas takes 1+ seconds to load while waiting for firmware:

[2.822603] megaraid_sas 0000:03:00.0: Waiting for FW to come to ready state
[3.871003] megaraid_sas 0000:03:00.0: FW now in Ready state

This is due to the following loop in megasas_transition_to_ready(), which
waits a minimum of 1 second, even though the FW becomes ready in tens of
millisecs:

        /*
         * The cur_state should not last for more than max_wait secs
         */
        for (i = 0; i < max_wait; i++) {
                ...
                msleep(1000);
        ...
        dev_info(&instance->pdev->dev, "FW now in Ready state\n");

This is a regression, caused by a change of the msleep granularity from 1
to 1000 due to concern about waiting too long on systems with coarse
jiffies.

To fix, increase iterations and use msleep(20), which results in:

[2.670627] megaraid_sas 0000:03:00.0: Waiting for FW to come to ready state
[2.739386] megaraid_sas 0000:03:00.0: FW now in Ready state
