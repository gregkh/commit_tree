genirq: Provide basic NMI management for interrupt lines

Add functionality to allocate interrupt lines that will deliver IRQs
as Non-Maskable Interrupts. These allocations are only successful if
the irqchip provides the necessary support and allows NMI delivery for the
interrupt line.

Interrupt lines allocated for NMI delivery must be enabled/disabled through
enable_nmi/disable_nmi_nosync to keep their state consistent.

To treat a PERCPU IRQ as NMI, the interrupt must not be shared nor threaded,
the irqchip directly managing the IRQ must be the root irqchip and the
irqchip cannot be behind a slow bus.
