crypto: arm64/aes-neonbs - fix returning final keystream block

The arm64 NEON bit-sliced implementation of AES-CTR fails the improved
skcipher tests because it sometimes produces the wrong ciphertext.  The
bug is that the final keystream block isn't returned from the assembly
code when the number of non-final blocks is zero.  This can happen if
the input data ends a few bytes after a page boundary.  In this case the
last bytes get "encrypted" by XOR'ing them with uninitialized memory.

Fix the assembly code to return the final keystream block when needed.
