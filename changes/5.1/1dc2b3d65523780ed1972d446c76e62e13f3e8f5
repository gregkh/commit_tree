qede: fix write to free'd pointer error and double free of ptp

The err2 error return path calls qede_ptp_disable that cleans up
on an error and frees ptp. After this, the free'd ptp is dereferenced
when ptp->clock is set to NULL and the code falls-through to error
path err1 that frees ptp again.

Fix this by calling qede_ptp_disable and exiting via an error
return path that does not set ptp->clock or kfree ptp.
