IB/{hfi1,qib}: Cleanup open coded sge sizing

Sge sizing is done in several places using an open coded method.

This can cause maintenance issues.  The open coded method is
encapsulated in a helper routine.  The helper was introduced with
commit:

1198fcea8a78 ("IB/hfi1, rdmavt: Move SGE state helper routines into
rdmavt")

Update all call sites that have the open coded path with the helper
routine.
