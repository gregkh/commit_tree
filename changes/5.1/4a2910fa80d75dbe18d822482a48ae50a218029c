ARM: 8836/1: drivers: amba: Update component matching to use the CoreSight UCI values.

The patches provide an update of amba_device and matching code to handle
the additional registers required for the Class 0x9 (CoreSight) UCI.

The *data pointer in the amba_id is used by the driver to provide extended
ID register values for matching.

CoreSight components where PID/CID pair is currently sufficient for
unique identification need not provide this additional information.
