component: Add documentation

While typing these I think doing an s/component_master/aggregate/
would be useful:
- it's shorter :-)
- I think component/aggregate is much more meaningful naming than
  component/puppetmaster or something like that. At least to my
  English ear "aggregate" emphasizes much more the "assemble a pile of
  things into something bigger" aspect, and there's not really much
  of a control hierarchy between aggregate and constituing components.

But that's way more than a quick doc typing exercise ...

Thanks to Ram for commenting on an initial draft of these docs.

v2: Review from Rafael:
- git add Documenation/driver-api/component.rst
- lots of polish to the wording + spelling fixes.

v3: Review from Russell:
- s/framework/helper
- clarify the documentation for component_match_add functions.

v4: Remove a few superflous "This".
