drm/amd/display: Pass app_tf by value rather than by reference

Clang warns when an expression that equals zero is used as a null
pointer constant (in lieu of NULL):

drivers/gpu/drm/amd/amdgpu/../display/amdgpu_dm/amdgpu_dm.c:4435:3:
warning: expression which evaluates to zero treated as a null pointer
constant of type 'const enum color_transfer_func *'
[-Wnon-literal-null-conversion]
                TRANSFER_FUNC_UNKNOWN,
                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1 warning generated.

This warning is caused by commit bb47de736661 ("drm/amdgpu: Set FreeSync
state using drm VRR properties") and it could be solved by using NULL
instead of TRANSFER_FUNC_UNKNOWN or casting TRANSFER_FUNC_UNKNOWN as a
pointer. However, after looking into it, there doesn't appear to be a
good reason to pass app_tf by reference as it is never mutated along the
way. This is the only code path in which app_tf is used:

mod_freesync_build_vrr_infopacket ->
    build_vrr_infopacket_v2 ->
        build_vrr_infopacket_fs2_data

Neither mod_freesync_build_vrr_infopacket or build_vrr_infopacket_v2
modify app_tf's value and build_vrr_infopacket_fs2_data expects just
the value so we can avoid dereferencing anything by just passing in
app_tf's value to mod_freesync_build_vrr_infopacket and
build_vrr_infopacket_v2.

There is no functional change because build_vrr_infopacket_fs2_data
doesn't do anything if TRANSFER_FUNC_UNKNOWN is passed to it, the same
as not calling build_vrr_infopacket_fs2_data at all like before this
change when NULL was used for app_tf.
