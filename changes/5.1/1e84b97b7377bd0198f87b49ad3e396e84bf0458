io_uring: fix notes on barriers

The application reading the CQ ring needs a barrier to pair with the
smp_store_release in io_commit_cqring, not the barrier after it.

Also a write barrier *after* writing something (but not *before*
writing anything interesting) doesn't order anything, so an smp_wmb()
after writing SQ tail is not needed.

Additionally consider reading SQ head and writing CQ tail in the notes.

Also add some clarifications how the various other fields in the ring
buffers are used.
