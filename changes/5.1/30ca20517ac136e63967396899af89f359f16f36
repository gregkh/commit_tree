tools headers: Move the nolibc header from rcutorture to tools/include/nolibc/

As suggested by Ingo, this header file might benefit other tools than
just rcutorture. For now it's quite limited, but is easy to extend, so
exposing it into tools/include/nolibc/ will make it much easier to
adopt by other tools.

The mkinitrd.sh script in rcutorture was updated to use this new location.
