SUNRPC: Introduce rpc_prepare_reply_pages()

prepare_reply_buffer() and its NFSv4 equivalents expose the details
of the RPC header and the auth slack values to upper layer
consumers, creating a layering violation, and duplicating code.

Remedy these issues by adding a new RPC client API that hides those
details from upper layers in a common helper function.
