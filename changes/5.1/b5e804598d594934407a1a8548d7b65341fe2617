aids which allows to test specific kernel behaviour depending on
specific facilities presence. It also affects CPU alternatives.

"facilities=" command line option format is comma separated list of
integer values to be additionally set or cleared (if value is starting
with "!"). Values ranges are also supported. e.g.:

facilities=!130-160,159,167-169
