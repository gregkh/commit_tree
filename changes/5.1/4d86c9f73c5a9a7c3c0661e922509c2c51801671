clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Remove omap_dm_timer_set_load_start

Commit 008258d995a6 ("clocksource/drivers/timer-ti-dm: Make
omap_dm_timer_set_load_start() static") made omap_dm_time_set_load_start
static because its prototype was not defined in a header. Unfortunately,
this causes a build warning on multi_v7_defconfig because this function
is not used anywhere in this translation unit:

drivers/clocksource/timer-ti-dm.c:589:12: error: unused function
'omap_dm_timer_set_load_start' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]

In fact, omap_dm_timer_set_load_start hasn't been used anywhere since
commit f190be7f39a5 ("staging: tidspbridge: remove driver") and the
prototype was removed in commit 592ea6bd1fad ("clocksource: timer-ti-dm:
Make unexported functions static"), which is probably where this should
have happened.
