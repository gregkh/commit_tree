time: Move CONTEXT_TRACKING to kernel/time/Kconfig

Both CONTEXT_TRACKING and CONTEXT_TRACKING_FORCE are currently defined
in kernel/rcu/kconfig, which might have made sense at some point, but
no longer does given that RCU refers to neither of these Kconfig options.

Therefore move them to kernel/time/Kconfig, where the rest of the
NO_HZ_FULL Kconfig options live.
