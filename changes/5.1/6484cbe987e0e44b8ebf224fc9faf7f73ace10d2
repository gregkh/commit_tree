rbd: handle DISCARD and WRITE_ZEROES separately

With discard_zeroes_data gone in commit 48920ff2a5a9 ("block: remove
the discard_zeroes_data flag"), continuing to provide this guarantee is
pointless: applications can't query it and discards can only be used
for deallocating.

Add OBJ_OP_ZEROOUT and move the existing logic under it.  As the first
step to divorcing OBJ_OP_DISCARD, stop worrying about copyups but keep
special casing whole-object layered discards.
