kernfs: Allocating memory for kernfs_iattrs with kmem_cache.

Creating a new cache for kernfs_iattrs.
Currently, memory is allocated with kzalloc() which
always gives aligned memory. On ARM, this is 64 byte aligned.
To avoid the wastage of memory in aligning the size requested,
a new cache for kernfs_iattrs is created.

Size of struct kernfs_iattrs is 80 Bytes.
On ARM, it will come in kmalloc-128 slab.
and it will come in kmalloc-192 slab if debug info is enabled.
Extra bytes taken 48 bytes.

Total number of objects created : 4096
Total saving = 48*4096 = 192 KB

After creating new slab(When debug info is enabled) :
sh-3.2# cat /proc/slabinfo
...
kernfs_iattrs_cache   4069   4096    128   32    1 : tunables    0    0    0 : slabdata    128    128      0
...

All testing has been done on ARM target.
