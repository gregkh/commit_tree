pwm: imx: Split into two drivers

The two PWM implementations called v1 (for i.MX1 and i.MX21) and v2 (for
i.MX27 and later) have nothing in common apart from needing two clocks
named "per" and "ipg" and being integrated in a SoC named i.MX.

So split the file containing the two disjunct drivers into two files and
two complete separate drivers.
