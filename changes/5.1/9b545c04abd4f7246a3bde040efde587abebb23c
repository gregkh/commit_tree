perf/x86/kvm: Avoid unnecessary work in guest filtering

KVM added a workaround for PEBS events leaking into guests with
commit:

  26a4f3c08de4 ("perf/x86: disable PEBS on a guest entry.")

This uses the VT entry/exit list to add an extra disable of the
PEBS_ENABLE MSR.

Intel also added a fix for this issue to microcode updates on
Haswell/Broadwell/Skylake.

It turns out using the MSR entry/exit list makes VM exits
significantly slower. The list is only needed for disabling
PEBS, because the GLOBAL_CTRL change gets optimized by
KVM into changing the VMCS.

Check for the microcode updates that have the microcode
fix for leaking PEBS, and disable the extra entry/exit list
entry for PEBS_ENABLE. In addition we always clear the
GLOBAL_CTRL for the PEBS counter while running in the guest,
which is enough to make them never fire at the wrong
side of the host/guest transition.

The overhead for VM exits with the filtering active with the patch is
reduced from 8% to 4%.

The microcode patch has already been merged into future platforms.
This patch is one-off thing. The quirks is used here.

For other old platforms which doesn't have microcode patch and quirks,
extra disable of the PEBS_ENABLE MSR is still required.
