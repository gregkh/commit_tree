cpcap-charger: generate events for userspace

The driver doesn't generate uevents on charger connect/disconnect.
This leads to UPower not detecting when AC is on or off... and that is
bad.

Reported by Arthur D. on github (
https://github.com/maemo-leste/bugtracker/issues/206 ), thanks to
Merlijn Wajer for suggesting a fix.
