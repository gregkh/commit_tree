fuse: support clients that don't implement 'opendir'

Allow filesystems to return ENOSYS from opendir, preventing the kernel from
sending opendir and releasedir messages in the future. This avoids
userspace transitions when filesystems don't need to keep track of state
per directory handle.

A new capability flag, FUSE_NO_OPENDIR_SUPPORT, parallels
FUSE_NO_OPEN_SUPPORT, indicating the new semantics for returning ENOSYS
from opendir.
