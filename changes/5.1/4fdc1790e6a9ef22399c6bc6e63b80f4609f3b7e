usb: handle warm-reset port requests on hub resume

On plug-in of my USB-C device, its USB_SS_PORT_LS_SS_INACTIVE
link state bit is set. Greping all the kernel for this bit shows
that the port status requests a warm-reset this way.

This just happens, if its the only device on the root hub, the hub
therefore resumes and the HCDs status_urb isn't yet available.
If a warm-reset request is detected, this sets the hubs event_bits,
which will prevent any auto-suspend and allows the hubs workqueue
to warm-reset the port later in port_event.
