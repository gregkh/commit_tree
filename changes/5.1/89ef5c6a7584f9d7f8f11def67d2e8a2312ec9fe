video: offb: annotate implicit fall throughs

There is a plan to build the kernel with -Wimplicit-fallthrough and
these places in the code produced warnings (W=1). Fix them up.

This commit remove the following warnings:

  drivers/video/fbdev/offb.c:211:5: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  drivers/video/fbdev/offb.c:142:3: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
