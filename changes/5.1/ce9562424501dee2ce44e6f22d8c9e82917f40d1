i2c: tegra: add bus clear Master Support

Bus clear feature of Tegra I2C controller helps to recover from
bus hang when I2C master loses the bus arbitration due to the
slave device holding SDA LOW continuously for some unknown reasons.

Per I2C specification, the device that held the bus LOW should
release it within 9 clock pulses.

During bus clear operation, Tegra I2C controller sends 9 clock
pulses and terminates the transaction with STOP condition.
Upon successful bus clear operation, bus goes to idle state and
driver retries the transaction.
