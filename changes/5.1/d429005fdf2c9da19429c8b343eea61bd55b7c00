cxgb4/cxgb4vf: Add support for SGE doorbell queue timer

T6 introduced a Timer Mechanism in SGE called the
SGE Doorbell Queue Timer. With this we can now configure
TX Queues to get CIDX Updates when:

    Time(CIDX == PIDX) >= Timer

Previously we rely on TX Queue Status Page updates by hardware
for DMA completions. This will make Hardware/Firmware actually
deliver the CIDX Updates as Ingress Queue messages with
commensurate Interrupts.

So we now have a new RX Path component for processing CIDX Updates
and reclaiming TX Descriptors faster.
