mac80211: don't attempt to rename ERR_PTR() debugfs dirs

We need to dereference the directory to get its parent to
be able to rename it, so it's clearly not safe to try to
do this with ERR_PTR() pointers. Skip in this case.

It seems that this is most likely what was causing the
report by syzbot, but I'm not entirely sure as it didn't
come with a reproducer this time.
