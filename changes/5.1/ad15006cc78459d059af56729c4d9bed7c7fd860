kbuild: clang: choose GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR not on LD

This causes an issue when trying to build with `make LD=ld.lld` if
ld.lld and the rest of your cross tools aren't in the same directory
(ex. /usr/local/bin) (as is the case for Android's build system), as the
GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR then gets set based on `which $(LD)` which will point
where LLVM tools are, not GCC/binutils tools are located.

Instead, select the GCC_TOOLCHAIN_DIR based on another tool provided by
binutils for which LLVM does not provide a substitute for, such as
elfedit.
