powerpc/6xx: fix setup and use of SPRN_SPRG_PGDIR for hash32

Not only the 603 but all 6xx need SPRN_SPRG_PGDIR to be initialised at
startup. This patch move it from __setup_cpu_603() to start_here()
and __secondary_start(), close to the initialisation of SPRN_THREAD.

Previously, virt addr of PGDIR was retrieved from thread struct.
Now that it is the phys addr which is stored in SPRN_SPRG_PGDIR,
hash_page() shall not convert it to phys anymore.
This patch removes the conversion.
