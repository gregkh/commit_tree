arm64: Skip preemption when exiting an NMI

Handling of an NMI should not set any TIF flags. For NMIs received from
EL0 the current exit path is safe to use.

However, an NMI received at EL1 could have interrupted some task context
that has set the TIF_NEED_RESCHED flag. Preempting a task should not
happen as a result of an NMI.

Skip preemption after handling an NMI from EL1.
