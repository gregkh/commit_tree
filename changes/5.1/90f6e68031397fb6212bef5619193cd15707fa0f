ASoC: codecs: ad193x: Fix frame polarity for DSP_A format

By default, the codec starts to interpret the left (first) channel on
the falling edge (low polarity) of LRCLK. However, for DSP_A, the left
channel needs to start on the rising edge of LRCLK. This patch fixes
this channel swap by toggling the bit which selects the LRCLK polarity.
