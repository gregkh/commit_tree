ASoC: da7219: Add recalc_rate function to return DAI clock rate

By making MCLK parent of DAI clocks, when querying the rate of the
clock the rate returned is now given from the parent clock so
gives the MCLK rate rather than 0 as previously returned. This is
a bit misleading, and actually there's no major reason why we can't
at least return the DAI WCLK rate, as set in HW, so that's what we
now do.
