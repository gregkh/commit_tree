dm: eliminate 'split_discard_bios' flag from DM target interface

There is no need to have DM core split discards on behalf of a DM target
now that blk_queue_split() handles splitting discards based on the
queue_limits.  A DM target just needs to set max_discard_sectors,
discard_granularity, etc, in queue_limits.
