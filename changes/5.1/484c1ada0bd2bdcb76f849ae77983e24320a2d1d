net/mlx5e: Use fail-safe channels reopen in tx reporter recover

When requested to recover from error, the tx reporter might open new
channels and close the existing ones. Use safe channels switch flow in
order to guarantee opened channels at the end of the recover flow.
For this purpose, define mlx5e_safe_reopen_channels function and use it
within those flows.
