gpio: mockup: fix debugfs read

The debugfs read callback must advance ppos or users using read() on
the file descriptor will never get the EOL. This wasn't spotted before
as I was using busybox cat for testing which uses sendfile() internally
and only noticed it now when switched to cat from coreutils.
