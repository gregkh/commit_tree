cpufreq: stats: Fix concurrency issues while resetting stats

It is possible for cpufreq_stats_clear_table() and
cpufreq_stats_record_transition() to get called concurrently and they
will try to update same variables simultaneously and may lead to
corruption of data.

Prevent that with the help of existing spinlock.
