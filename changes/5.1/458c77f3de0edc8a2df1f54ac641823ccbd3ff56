macintosh/via-cuda: Don't rely on Cuda to end a transfer

Certain Cuda transfers have to be ended by the driver. According
to Apple's open source Cuda driver, as found in mkLinux and XNU, this
applies to any "open ended request such as PRAM read". This fixes an
infinite polling loop in cuda_pram_read_byte().
