ACPI / video: Extend chassis-type detection with a "Lunch Box" check

Commit 53fa1f6e8a59 ("ACPI / video: Only default only_lcd to true on
Win8-ready _desktops_") introduced chassis type detection, limiting the
lcd_only check for the backlight to devices where the chassis-type
indicates their is no builtin LCD panel.

The purpose of the lcd_only check is to avoid advertising a backlight
interface on desktops, since skylake and newer machines seem to always
have a backlight interface even if there is no LCD panel. The limiting
of this check to desktops only was done to avoid breaking backlight
support on some laptops which do not have the lcd flag set.

The Fujitsu ESPRIMO Q910 which is a compact (NUC like) desktop machine
has a chassis type of 0x10 aka "Lunch Box". Without the lcd_only check
we end up falsely advertising backlight/brightness control on this
device. This commit extend the dmi_is_desktop check to return true
for type 0x10 to fix this.
