net_sched: add hit counter for matchall

Although matchall always matches packets, however, it still
relies on a protocol match first. So it is still useful to have
such a counter for matchall. Of course, unlike u32, every time
we hit a matchall filter, it is always a success, so we don't
have to distinguish them.

Sample output:

filter protocol 802.1Q pref 100 matchall chain 0
filter protocol 802.1Q pref 100 matchall chain 0 handle 0x1
  not_in_hw (rule hit 10)
	action order 1: vlan  pop continue
	 index 1 ref 1 bind 1 installed 40 sec used 1 sec
	Action statistics:
	Sent 836 bytes 10 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
	backlog 0b 0p requeues 0
