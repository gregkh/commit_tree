KVM: VMX: Use #defines in place of immediates in VM-Enter inline asm

...to prepare for moving the inline asm to a proper asm sub-routine.
Eliminating the immediates allows a nearly verbatim move, e.g. quotes,
newlines, tabs and __stringify need to be dropped, but other than those
cosmetic changes the only function change will be to replace the final
"jmp" with a "ret".
