udp: fix GRO reception in case of length mismatch

Currently, the UDP GRO code path does bad things on some edge
conditions - Aggregation can happen even on packet with different
lengths.

Fix the above by rewriting the 'complete' condition for GRO
packets. While at it, note explicitly that we allow merging the
first packet per burst below gso_size.
