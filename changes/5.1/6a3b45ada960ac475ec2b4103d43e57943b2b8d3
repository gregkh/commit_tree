drm/exynos/mixer: fix MIXER shadow registry synchronisation code

MIXER on Exynos5 SoCs uses different synchronisation method than Exynos4
to update internal state (shadow registers).
Apparently the driver implements it incorrectly. The rule should be
as follows:
- do not request updating registers until previous request was finished,
  ie. MXR_CFG_LAYER_UPDATE_COUNT must be 0.
- before setting registers synchronisation on VSYNC should be turned off,
  ie. MXR_STATUS_SYNC_ENABLE should be reset,
- after finishing MXR_STATUS_SYNC_ENABLE should be set again.
The patch hopefully implements it correctly.
Below sample kernel log from page fault caused by the bug:
