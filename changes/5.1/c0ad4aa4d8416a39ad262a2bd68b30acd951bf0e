sched/fair: Robustify CFS-bandwidth timer locking

Traditionally hrtimer callbacks were run with IRQs disabled, but with
the introduction of HRTIMER_MODE_SOFT it is possible they run from
SoftIRQ context, which does _NOT_ have IRQs disabled.

Allow for the CFS bandwidth timers (period_timer and slack_timer) to
be ran from SoftIRQ context; this entails removing the assumption that
IRQs are already disabled from the locking.

While mainline doesn't strictly need this, -RT forces all timers not
explicitly marked with MODE_HARD into MODE_SOFT and trips over this.
And marking these timers as MODE_HARD doesn't make sense as they're
not required for RT operation and can potentially be quite expensive.
