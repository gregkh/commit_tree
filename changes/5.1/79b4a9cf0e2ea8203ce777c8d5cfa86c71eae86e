MIPS: scall64-o32: Fix indirect syscall number load

Commit 4c21b8fd8f14 (MIPS: seccomp: Handle indirect system calls (o32))
added indirect syscall detection for O32 processes running on MIPS64,
but it did not work correctly for big endian kernel/processes. The
reason is that the syscall number is loaded from ARG1 using the lw
instruction while this is a 64-bit value, so zero is loaded instead of
the syscall number.

Fix the code by using the ld instruction instead. When running a 32-bit
processes on a 64 bit CPU, the values are properly sign-extended, so it
ensures the value passed to syscall_trace_enter is correct.

Recent systemd versions with seccomp enabled whitelist the getpid
syscall for their internal  processes (e.g. systemd-journald), but call
it through syscall(SYS_getpid). This fix therefore allows O32 big endian
systems with a 64-bit kernel to run recent systemd versions.
