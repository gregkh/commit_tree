drm/amd/display: interface to check if timing can be seamless

[Why]
Need to figure out whether a timing we want to commit matches
something that GOP already programmed, in which case
we can decide to some optimizations

[How]
1. Add way to check for DIG FE
2. Add way to check for matching OTG timing
3. Add way to check for matching pixel clock (if possible)
    - Currently only support DP for pixel clock, since it is easy to calc
