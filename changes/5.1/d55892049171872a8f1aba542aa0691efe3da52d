KVM: VMX: Use vcpu->arch.regs directly when saving/loading guest state

...now that all other references to struct vcpu_vmx have been removed.

Note that 'vmx' still needs to be passed into the asm blob in _ASM_ARG1
as it is consumed by vmx_update_host_rsp().  And similar to that code,
use _ASM_ARG2 in the assembly code to prepare for moving to proper asm,
while explicitly referencing the exact registers in the clobber list for
clarity in the short term and to avoid additional precompiler games.
