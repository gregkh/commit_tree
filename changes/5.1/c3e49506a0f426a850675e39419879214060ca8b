tracing: Split up onmatch action data

Currently, the onmatch action data binds the onmatch action to data
related to synthetic event generation.  Since we want to allow the
onmatch handler to potentially invoke a different action, and because
we expect other handlers to generate synthetic events, we need to
separate the data related to these two functions.

Also rename the onmatch data to something more descriptive, and create
and use common action data destroy function.
