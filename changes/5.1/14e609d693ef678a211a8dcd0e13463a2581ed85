powerpc/mm/32: add base address to mmu_mapin_ram()

At the time being, mmu_mapin_ram() always maps RAM from the beginning.
But some platforms like the WII have to map a second block of RAM.

This patch adds to mmu_mapin_ram() the base address of the block.
At the moment, only base address 0 is supported.
