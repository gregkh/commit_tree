cxgb4: clip_tbl: Use struct_size() in kvzalloc()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding the
size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along with memory
for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct foo {
    int stuff;
    struct boo entry[];
};

instance = kvzalloc(sizeof(struct foo) + count * sizeof(struct boo), GFP_KERNEL);

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can now
use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = kvzalloc(struct_size(instance, entry, count), GFP_KERNEL);

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
