KVM: nVMX: Let the compiler select the reg for holding HOST_RSP

...and provide an explicit name for the constraint.  Naming the input
constraint makes the code self-documenting and also avoids the fragility
of numerically referring to constraints, e.g. %4 breaks badly whenever
the constraints are modified.

Explicitly using RDX was inherited from vCPU-run, i.e. completely
arbitrary.  Even vCPU-run doesn't truly need to explicitly use RDX, but
doing so is more robust as vCPU-run needs tight control over its
register usage.

Note that while the naming "conflict" between host_rsp and HOST_RSP
is slightly confusing, the former will be renamed slightly in a
future patch, at which point HOST_RSP is absolutely what is desired.
