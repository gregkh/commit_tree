crypto: arm64/aes-ccm - fix bugs in non-NEON fallback routine

Commit 5092fcf34908 ("crypto: arm64/aes-ce-ccm: add non-SIMD generic
fallback") introduced C fallback code to replace the NEON routines
when invoked from a context where the NEON is not available (i.e.,
from the context of a softirq taken while the NEON is already being
used in kernel process context)

Fix two logical flaws in the MAC calculation of the associated data.
