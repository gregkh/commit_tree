mm/vmalloc: pass VM_USERMAP flags directly to __vmalloc_node_range()

vmalloc_user*() calls differ from normal vmalloc() only in that they set
VM_USERMAP flags for the area.  During the whole history of vmalloc.c
changes now it is possible simply to pass VM_USERMAP flags directly to
__vmalloc_node_range() call instead of finding the area (which obviously
takes time) after the allocation.
