staging: erofs: fix race of initializing xattrs of a inode at the same time

In real scenario, there could be several threads accessing xattrs
of the same xattr-uninitialized inode, and init_inode_xattrs()
almost at the same time.

That's actually an unexpected behavior, this patch closes the race.
