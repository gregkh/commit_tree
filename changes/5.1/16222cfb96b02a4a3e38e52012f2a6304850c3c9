s390/zcrypt: fix possible deadlock situation on ap queue remove

With commit 01396a374c3d ("s390/zcrypt: revisit ap device remove
procedure") the ap queue remove is now a two stage process. However,
a del_timer_sync() call may trigger the timer function which may
try to lock the very same spinlock as is held by the function
just initiating the del_timer_sync() call. This could end up in
a deadlock situation. Very unlikely but possible as you need to
remove an ap queue at the exact sime time when a timeout of a
request occurs.
