dt-bindings: clock: imx8mq: Fix numbering overlaps and gaps

IMX8MQ_CLK_USB_PHY_REF changes from 163 to 153, this way removing the gap.
All the following clock ids are now decreased by 10 to keep the numbering
right. Doing this, the IMX8MQ_CLK_CSI2_CORE is not overlapped with
IMX8MQ_CLK_GPT1 anymore. IMX8MQ_CLK_GPT1_ROOT changes from 193 to 183 and
all the following ids are updated accordingly.
