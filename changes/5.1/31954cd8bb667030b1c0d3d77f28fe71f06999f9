tcp: Refactor pingpong code

Instead of using pingpong as a single bit information, we refactor the
code to treat it as a counter. When interactive session is detected,
we set pingpong count to TCP_PINGPONG_THRESH. And when pingpong count
is >= TCP_PINGPONG_THRESH, we consider the session in pingpong mode.

This patch is a pure refactor and sets foundation for the next patch.
This patch itself does not change any pingpong logic.
