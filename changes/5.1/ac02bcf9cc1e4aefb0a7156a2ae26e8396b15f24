netfilter: ipv6: avoid indirect calls for IPV6=y case

indirect calls are only needed if ipv6 is a module.
Add helpers to abstract the v6ops indirections and use them instead.

fragment, reroute and route_input are kept as indirect calls.
The first two are not not used in hot path and route_input is only
used by bridge netfilter.
