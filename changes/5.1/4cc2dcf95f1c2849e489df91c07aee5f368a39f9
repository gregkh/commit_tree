crypto: testmgr - convert hash testing to use testvec_configs

Convert alg_test_hash() to use the new test framework, adding a list of
testvec_configs to test by default.  When the extra self-tests are
enabled, randomly generated testvec_configs are tested as well.

This improves hash test coverage mainly because now all algorithms have
a variety of data layouts tested, whereas before each algorithm was
responsible for declaring its own chunked test cases which were often
missing or provided poor test coverage.  The new code also tests both
the MAY_SLEEP and !MAY_SLEEP cases and buffers that cross pages.

This already found bugs in the hash walk code and in the arm32 and arm64
implementations of crct10dif.

I removed the hash chunked test vectors that were the same as
non-chunked ones, but left the ones that were unique.
