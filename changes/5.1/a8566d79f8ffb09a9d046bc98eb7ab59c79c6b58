media: vim2m: fix build breakage due to a merge conflict

A merge conflict rised when merging from -rc7. Fix it.

In this specific case, we don't need the if anymore, as the
work_run was moved to its rightful place (struct vim2m_ctx).

Fixes: b3e64e5b0778 ("media: vim2m: use per-file handler work queue")
Fixes: 240809ef6630 ("media: vim2m: only cancel work if it is for right context")
