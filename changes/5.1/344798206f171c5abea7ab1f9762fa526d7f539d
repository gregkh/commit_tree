software node: Implement get_named_child_node fwnode callback

This makes it possible to support drivers that use
fwnode_get_named_child_node() and device_get_named_child_node()
functions.

The node name is for now taken from a device property named
"name". That mimics the old style of naming of the nodes in
devicetree (though with modern flattened DT, the name is
matched against the actual node-name, it used to be done
with a property "name"). In Open Firmware DT the "name"
property is also still being used.
