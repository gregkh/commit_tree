drm/amd/display: Let updates with no scaling changes be fast

[Why]
DC was assuming that any surface_update->scaling_info
meant the update was at least medium.  However, if nothing
has changed there is no scaling to program, so there is
no problem with the update being fast

[How]
If every update flag is not set, the update is fast
