libnvdimm/dimm: Add a no-BLK quirk based on NVDIMM family

As Dexuan reports the NVDIMM_FAMILY_HYPERV platform is incompatible with
the existing Linux namespace implementation because it uses
NSLABEL_FLAG_LOCAL for x1-width PMEM interleave sets. Quirk it as an
platform / DIMM that does not provide BLK-aperture access. Allow the
libnvdimm core to assume no potential for aliasing. In case other
implementations make the same mistake, provide a "noblk" module
parameter to force-enable the quirk.
