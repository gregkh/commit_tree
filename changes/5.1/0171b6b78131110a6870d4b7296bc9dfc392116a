acpi/nfit: Require opt-in for read-only label configurations

Recent fixes to command handling enabled Linux to read label
configurations that it could not before. Unfortunately that means that
configurations that were operating in label-less mode will be broken as
the kernel ignores the existing namespace configuration and tries to
honor the new found labels.

Fortunately this seems limited to a case where Linux can quirk the
behavior and maintain the existing label-less semantics by default.
When the platform does not emit an _LSW method, disable all label access
methods. Provide a 'force_labels' module parameter to allow read-only
label operation.
