drm/i915: Prevent a race during I915_GEM_MMAP ioctl with WC set

Make sure the underlying VMA in the process address space is the
same as it was during vm_mmap to avoid applying WC to wrong VMA.

A more long-term solution would be to have vm_mmap_locked variant
in linux/mmap.h for when caller wants to hold mmap_sem for an
extended duration.

v2:
- Refactor the compare function
