Bluetooth: hci_qca: use wait_until_sent() for power pulses

wcn3990 requires a power pulse to turn ON/OFF along with
regulators. Sometimes we are observing the power pulses are sent
out with some time delay, due to queuing these commands. This is
causing synchronization issues with chip, which intern delay the
chip setup or may end up with communication issues.
