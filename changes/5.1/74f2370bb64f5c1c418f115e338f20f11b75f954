KVM: x86: expose MOVDIRI CPU feature into VM.

MOVDIRI moves doubleword or quadword from register to memory through
direct store which is implemented by using write combining (WC) for
writing data directly into memory without caching the data.

Availability of the MOVDIRI instruction is indicated by the presence of
the CPUID feature flag MOVDIRI(CPUID.0x07.0x0:ECX[bit 27]).

This patch exposes the movdiri feature to the guest.
