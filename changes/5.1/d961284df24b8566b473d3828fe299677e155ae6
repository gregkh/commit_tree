ath10k: correct the format of host memory chunks in wmi init command

This is a theoretical fix, the issue is found in code review.
When adding the host memory chunks into wmi-tlv init command,
there is no separate tlv header for each host memory chunk
in the struct array, which breaches the convention between
host and firmware, will result in mismatch between the two.

To fix this issue, add separate tlv headers for the host
memory chunks in wmi-tlv init command.
