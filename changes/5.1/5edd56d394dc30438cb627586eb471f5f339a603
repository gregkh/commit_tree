drm/i915/selftests: Check we can recover a wedged device

After declaring a terminally wedged device, we allow ourselves to
recover on the next GPU reset (manually triggered), or resume. Check
that resetting a wedged device does work.

v2: Add rpm (taken explicitly in the subtest in case we remove the outer
wakeref) and early warning to i915_reset() for missed wakerefs
