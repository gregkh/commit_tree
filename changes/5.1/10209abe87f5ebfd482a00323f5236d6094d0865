usb: dwc2: gadget: Add scatter-gather mode

This patch adds support for transferring requests, which are
non-contiguous in physical memory, i.e. the data buffer is described by
a scatter-list. This allows transferring large requests without relying
on error-prone contiguous buffer allocations. This way of allocating
requests is already implemented in functionfs and TCM USB functions and
automatically used if UDC driver advertises scatter-gather suppport.
