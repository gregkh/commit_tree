ARM: tegra: add "jedec,spi-nor" flash compatible binding

Starting with commit 8947e396a829 ("Documentation: dt: mtd: replace
"nor-jedec" binding with "jedec, spi-nor"") we have "jedec,spi-nor"
binding indicating support for JEDEC identification.

Use it for all flashes that are supposed to support READ ID op according
to the datasheets.
