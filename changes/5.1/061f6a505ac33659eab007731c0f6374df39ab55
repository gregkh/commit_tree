net: dsa: Add ndo_vlan_rx_{add, kill}_vid implementation

In order to properly support VLAN filtering being enabled/disabled on a
bridge, while having other ports being non bridge port members, we need
to support the ndo_vlan_rx_{add,kill}_vid callbacks in order to make
sure the non-bridge ports can continue receiving VLAN tags, even when
the switch is globally configured to do ingress/egress VID checking.

Since we can call dsa_port_vlan_{add,del} with a bridge_dev pointer
NULL, we now need to check that in these two functions.

We specifically deal with two possibly problematic cases:

- creating a bridge VLAN entry while there is an existing VLAN device
  claiming that same VID

- creating a VLAN device while there is an existing bridge VLAN entry
  with that VID

Those are both resolved with returning -EBUSY back to user-space.
