ALSA: hda/tegra: runtime power management support

This patch enables runtime power management(runtime PM) support for
hda. pm_runtime_enable() and pm_runtime_disable() are added during
device probe and remove respectively. The runtime PM callbacks will
be forbidden if hda controller does not have support for runtime PM.
pm_runtime_get_sync() and pm_runtime_put() are added for hda register
access. The callbacks for above will be added in subsequent patches.
