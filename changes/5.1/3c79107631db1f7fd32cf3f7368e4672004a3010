netfilter: ctnetlink: don't use conntrack/expect object addresses as id

else, we leak the addresses to userspace via ctnetlink events
and dumps.

Compute an ID on demand based on the immutable parts of nf_conn struct.

Another advantage compared to using an address is that there is no
immediate re-use of the same ID in case the conntrack entry is freed and
reallocated again immediately.
