Bluetooth: mgmt: Use struct_size() helper

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes, in particular in the
context in which this code is being used.

So, change the following form:

sizeof(*rp) + (sizeof(rp->entry[0]) * count);

to :

struct_size(rp, entry, count)

Notice that, in this case, variable rp_len is not necessary, hence
it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
