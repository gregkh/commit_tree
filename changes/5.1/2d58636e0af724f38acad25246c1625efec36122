char/nvram: Allow the set_checksum and initialize ioctls to be omitted

The drivers/char/nvram.c module has previously supported only RTC "CMOS"
NVRAM, for which it provides appropriate checksum ioctls. Make these
ioctls optional so the module can be re-used with other kinds of NVRAM.

The ops struct methods that implement the ioctls now return error
codes so that a multi-platform kernel binary can do the right thing when
running on hardware without a suitable NVRAM.
