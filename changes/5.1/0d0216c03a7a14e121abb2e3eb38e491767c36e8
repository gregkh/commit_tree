compat ABI: use non-compat openat and open_by_handle_at variants

The only difference between native and compat openat and open_by_handle_at
is that non-compat version forces O_LARGEFILE, and it should be the
default behaviour for all architectures, as we are going to drop the
support of 32-bit userspace off_t.
