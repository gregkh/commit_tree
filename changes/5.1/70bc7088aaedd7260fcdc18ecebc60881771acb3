btrfs: refactor btrfs_free_stale_devices() to get return value

Preparatory patch to add ioctl that allows to forget a device (ie.
reverse of scan).

Refactors btrfs_free_stale_devices() to obtain return status. As this
function can fail if it can't find the given path (returns -ENOENT) or
trying to delete a mounted device (returns -EBUSY).
