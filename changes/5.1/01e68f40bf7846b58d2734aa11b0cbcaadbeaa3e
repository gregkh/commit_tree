xfs: create a separate finobt verifier

The inobt verifier is reused for the inobt and finobt, which
prevents the ability to distinguish between magic values on a
per-tree basis. Create a separate finobt structure in preparation
for changes to enforce the appropriate magic value for the
associated tree. This patch has no functional change.
