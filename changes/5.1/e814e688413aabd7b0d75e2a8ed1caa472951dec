i2c: of: Try to find an I2C adapter matching the parent

If an I2C adapter doesn't match the provided device tree node, also try
matching the parent's device tree node. This allows finding an adapter
based on the device node of the parent device that was used to register
it.

This fixes a regression on Tegra124-based Chromebooks (Nyan) where the
eDP controller registers an I2C adapter that is used to read to EDID.
After commit 993a815dcbb2 ("dt-bindings: panel: Add missing .txt
suffix") this stopped working because the I2C adapter could no longer
be found. The approach in this patch fixes the regression without
introducing the issues that the above commit solved.
