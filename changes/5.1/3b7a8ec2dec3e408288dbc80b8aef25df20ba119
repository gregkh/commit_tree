samples/bpf: Check the prog id before exiting

Check the program id within the signal handler on polling xdp samples
that were previously converted to libbpf usage. Avoid the situation of
unloading the program that was not attached by sample that is exiting.
Handle also the case where bpf_get_link_xdp_id didn't exit with an error
but the xdp program was not found on an interface.
