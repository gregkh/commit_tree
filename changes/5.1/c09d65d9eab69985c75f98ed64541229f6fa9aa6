KVM: x86: Consider LAPIC TSC-Deadline timer expired if deadline too short

If guest sets MSR_IA32_TSCDEADLINE to value such that in host
time-domain it's shorter than lapic_timer_advance_ns, we can
reach a case that we call hrtimer_start() with expiration time set at
the past.

Because lapic_timer.timer is init with HRTIMER_MODE_ABS_PINNED, it
is not allowed to run in softirq and therefore will never expire.

To avoid such a scenario, verify that deadline expiration time is set on
host time-domain further than (now + lapic_timer_advance_ns).

A future patch can also consider adding a min_timer_deadline_ns module parameter,
similar to min_timer_period_us to avoid races that amount of ns it takes
to run logic could still call hrtimer_start() with expiration timer set
at the past.
