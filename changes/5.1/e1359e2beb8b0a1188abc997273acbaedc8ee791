KVM: x86/mmu: Detect MMIO generation wrap in any address space

The check to detect a wrap of the MMIO generation explicitly looks for a
generation number of zero.  Now that unique memslots generation numbers
are assigned to each address space, only address space 0 will get a
generation number of exactly zero when wrapping.  E.g. when address
space 1 goes from 0x7fffe to 0x80002, the MMIO generation number will
wrap to 0x2.  Adjust the MMIO generation to strip the address space
modifier prior to checking for a wrap.
