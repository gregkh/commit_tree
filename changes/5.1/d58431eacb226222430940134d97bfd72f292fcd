sunrpc: don't mark uninitialised items as VALID.

A recent commit added a call to cache_fresh_locked()
when an expired item was found.
The call sets the CACHE_VALID flag, so it is important
that the item actually is valid.
There are two ways it could be valid:
1/ If ->update has been called to fill in relevant content
2/ if CACHE_NEGATIVE is set, to say that content doesn't exist.

An expired item that is waiting for an update will be neither.
Setting CACHE_VALID will mean that a subsequent call to cache_put()
will be likely to dereference uninitialised pointers.

So we must make sure the item is valid, and we already have code to do
that in try_to_negate_entry().  This takes the hash lock and so cannot
be used directly, so take out the two lines that we need and use them.

Now cache_fresh_locked() is certain to be called only on
a valid item.
