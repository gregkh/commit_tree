drm/amd/display: Check that vrefresh is in freesync range

[Why]
Setting monitor refresh rate below freesync range would cause the
monitor to go blank indefinitely with freesync enabled

[How]
Set vrr_supported and ignore_msa_timing_param according to whether
the refresh rate is above or below the minimum freesync frequency.
