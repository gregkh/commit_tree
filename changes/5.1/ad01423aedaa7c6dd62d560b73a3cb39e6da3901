kthread: Do not use TIMER_IRQSAFE

The TIMER_IRQSAFE usage was introduced in commit 22597dc3d97b1 ("kthread:
initial support for delayed kthread work") which modelled the delayed
kthread code after workqueue's code. The workqueue code requires the flag
TIMER_IRQSAFE for synchronisation purpose. This is not true for kthread's
delay timer since all operations occur under a lock.

Remove TIMER_IRQSAFE from the timer initialisation and use timer_setup()
for initialisation purpose which is the official function.
