net-sysfs: call dev_hold if kobject_init_and_add success

In netdev_queue_add_kobject and rx_queue_add_kobject,
if sysfs_create_group failed, kobject_put will call
netdev_queue_release to decrease dev refcont, however
dev_hold has not be called. So we will see this while
unregistering dev:

unregister_netdevice: waiting for bcsh0 to become free. Usage count = -1
