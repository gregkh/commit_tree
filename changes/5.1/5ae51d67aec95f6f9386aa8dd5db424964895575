clk: clk-twl6040: Fix imprecise external abort for pdmclk

I noticed that modprobe clk-twl6040 can fail after a cold boot with:
abe_cm:clk:0010:0: failed to enable
...
Unhandled fault: imprecise external abort (0x1406) at 0xbe896b20

After searching around for a similar issue, I came across an earlier fix
that never got merged upstream in the Android tree for glass-omap-xrr02.
There is patch "MFD: twl6040-codec: Implement PDMCLK cold temp errata"
by Misael Lopez Cruz <misael.lopez@ti.com>.

Based on my observations, this fix is also needed when cold booting
devices, and not just for deeper idle modes. Since we now have a clock
driver for pdmclk, let's fix the issue in twl6040_pdmclk_prepare().
