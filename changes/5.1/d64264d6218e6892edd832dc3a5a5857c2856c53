ext4: add missing brelse() in add_new_gdb_meta_bg()

Currently in add_new_gdb_meta_bg() there is a missing brelse of gdb_bh
in case ext4_journal_get_write_access() fails.
Additionally kvfree() is missing in the same error path. Fix it by
moving the ext4_journal_get_write_access() before the ext4 sb update as
Ted suggested and release n_group_desc and gdb_bh in case it fails.
