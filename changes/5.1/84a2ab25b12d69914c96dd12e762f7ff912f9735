arm64: imx8mq: select PM support

The ATF on the i.MX8MQ device disables all non-essential power
domains. For correct on-SoC peripheral operation we need both
the power domain driver and generic domains, so device driver
probe gets ordered behind the power domain controller driver.

Select those options, as those being absent can lead to very
hard to debug failures.
