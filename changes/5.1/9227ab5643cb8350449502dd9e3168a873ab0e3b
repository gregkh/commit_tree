dmaengine: imx-dma: fix warning comparison of distinct pointer types

The warning got introduced by commit 930507c18304 ("arm64: add basic
Kconfig symbols for i.MX8"). Since it got enabled for arm64. The warning
haven't been seen before since size_t was 'unsigned int' when built on
arm32.

../drivers/dma/imx-dma.c: In function ‘imxdma_sg_next’:
../include/linux/kernel.h:846:29: warning: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast
   (!!(sizeof((typeof(x) *)1 == (typeof(y) *)1)))

Rework so that we use min_t and pass in the size_t that returns the
minimum of two values, using the specified type.
