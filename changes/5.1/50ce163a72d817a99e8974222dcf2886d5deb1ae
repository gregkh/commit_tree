tcp: tcp_grow_window() needs to respect tcp_space()

For some reason, tcp_grow_window() correctly tests if enough room
is present before attempting to increase tp->rcv_ssthresh,
but does not prevent it to grow past tcp_space()

This is causing hard to debug issues, like failing
the (__tcp_select_window(sk) >= tp->rcv_wnd) test
in __tcp_ack_snd_check(), causing ACK delays and possibly
slow flows.

Depending on tcp_rmem[2], MTU, skb->len/skb->truesize ratio,
we can see the problem happening on "netperf -t TCP_RR -- -r 2000,2000"
after about 60 round trips, when the active side no longer sends
immediate acks.

This bug predates git history.
