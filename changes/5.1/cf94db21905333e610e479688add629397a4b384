virtio: Honour 'may_reduce_num' in vring_create_virtqueue

vring_create_virtqueue() allows the caller to specify via the
may_reduce_num parameter whether the vring code is allowed to
allocate a smaller ring than specified.

However, the split ring allocation code tries to allocate a
smaller ring on allocation failure regardless of what the
caller specified. This may cause trouble for e.g. virtio-pci
in legacy mode, which does not support ring resizing. (The
packed ring code does not resize in any case.)

Let's fix this by bailing out immediately in the split ring code
if the requested size cannot be allocated and may_reduce_num has
not been specified.

While at it, fix a typo in the usage instructions.
