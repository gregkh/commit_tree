clk: qcom: Add CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT for 8998 branch clocks

A branch clock is basically a clock that can be gated for power savings,
but is also what devices/drivers consume.  Configuring a branch clock's
rate needs to be done at the source, so for all branch clocks which have
a defined parent, set CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT so that clk_set_rate() calls on
branch clocks can do what is expected.  This is important as most drivers
do not check the resulting clock rate after a successful clk_set_rate()
call, thus the driver may get out of sync with the actual hardware state
and weird issues might crop up.  This has been observed with issues
getting SDHCI to reliably support "fast" cards such as SDR104.
