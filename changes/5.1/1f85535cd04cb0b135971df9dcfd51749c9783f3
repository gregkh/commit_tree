drm/qxl: move qxl_primary_apply_cursor to correct place

The qxl device ties the cursor to the primary surface.  Therefore
calling qxl_io_destroy_primary() and qxl_io_create_primary() to switch
the framebuffer causes the cursor information being lost and the driver
must re-apply it.

The correct call order to do that is qxl_io_destroy_primary() +
qxl_io_create_primary() + qxl_primary_apply_cursor().

The old code did qxl_io_destroy_primary() + qxl_primary_apply_cursor() +
qxl_io_create_primary().  Due to qxl_primary_apply_cursor request being
queued in a ringbuffer and qxl_io_create_primary() trapping to the
hypervisor instantly there is a high chance that qxl_io_create_primary()
is processed first even with the wrong call order.  But it's racy and
thus not reliable.
