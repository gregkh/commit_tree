arm64: add ptrace regsets for ptrauth key management

Add two new ptrace regsets, which can be used to request and change the
pointer authentication keys of a thread. NT_ARM_PACA_KEYS gives access
to the instruction/data address keys, and NT_ARM_PACG_KEYS to the
generic authentication key. The keys are also part of the core dump file
of the process.

The regsets are only exposed if the kernel is compiled with
CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE=y, as the only intended use case is
checkpointing and restoring processes that are using pointer
authentication. (This can be changed later if there are other use
cases.)
