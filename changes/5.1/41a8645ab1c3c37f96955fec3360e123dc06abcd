KVM: PPC: Book3S PR: Add emulation for slbfee. instruction

Recent kernels, since commit e15a4fea4dee ("powerpc/64s/hash: Add
some SLB debugging tests", 2018-10-03) use the slbfee. instruction,
which PR KVM currently does not have code to emulate.  Consequently
recent kernels fail to boot under PR KVM.  This adds emulation of
slbfee., enabling these kernels to boot successfully.
