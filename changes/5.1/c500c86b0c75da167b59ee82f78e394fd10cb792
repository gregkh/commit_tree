net/mlx5e: support for two independent packet edit actions

This patch adds pedit_headers_action structure to store the result of
parsing tc pedit actions. Then, it calls alloc_tc_pedit_action() to
populate the mlx5e hardware intermediate representation once all actions
have been parsed.

This patch comes in preparation for the new flow_action infrastructure,
where each packet mangling comes in an separated action, ie. not packed
as in tc pedit.
