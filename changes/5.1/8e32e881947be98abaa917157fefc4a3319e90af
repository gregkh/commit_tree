pinctrl: sh-pfc: r8a7778: Fix HSPI pin numbers and names

When declaring the HSPI RX1_B and TX1_B pins, two mistakes were made:
  - the rows and columns in the BGA pin matrix, from which the pin
    numbers are derived, were exchanged,
  - it was not taken into account that pin row labelling skips
    characters I, O, Q, and S.

Fix the order, and the corresponding pin names.

Notes:
  - The actual values of the pin numbers don't really matter (they just
    have to be unique), so the wrong order didn't have any impact,
  - Changing the names of the pins is user-visible, but there are no
    users in (upstream) DTS files.
