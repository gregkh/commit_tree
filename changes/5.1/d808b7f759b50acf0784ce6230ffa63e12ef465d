nvmet: fix discover log page when offsets are used

The nvme target hadn't been taking the Get Log Page offset parameter
into consideration, and so has been returning corrupted log pages when
offsets are used. Since many tools, including nvme-cli, split the log
request to 4k, we've been breaking discovery log responses when more
than 3 subsystems exist.

Fix the returned data by internally generating the entire discovery
log page and copying only the requested bytes into the user buffer. The
command log page offset type has been modified to a native __le64 to
make it easier to extract the value from a command.
