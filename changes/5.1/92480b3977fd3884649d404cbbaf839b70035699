bonding: fix event handling for stacked bonds

When a bond is enslaved to another bond, bond_netdev_event() only
handles the event as if the bond is a master, and skips treating the
bond as a slave.

This leads to a refcount leak on the slave, since we don't remove the
adjacency to its master and the master holds a reference on the slave.

Reproducer:
  ip link add bondL type bond
  ip link add bondU type bond
  ip link set bondL master bondU
  ip link del bondL

No "Fixes:" tag, this code is older than git history.
