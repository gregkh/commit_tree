powerpc: sstep: Add support for maddhd, maddhdu, maddld instructions

This adds emulation support for the following integer instructions:
  * Multiply-Add High Doubleword (maddhd)
  * Multiply-Add High Doubleword Unsigned (maddhdu)
  * Multiply-Add Low Doubleword (maddld)

As suggested by Michael, this uses a raw .long for specifying the
instruction word when using inline assembly to retain compatibility
with older binutils.
