btrfs: split btrfs_clear_lock_blocking_rw to read and write helpers

There are many callers that hardcode the desired lock type so we can
avoid the switch and call them directly. Split the current function to
two. There are no remaining users of btrfs_clear_lock_blocking_rw so
it's removed.  The call sites will be converted in followup patches.
