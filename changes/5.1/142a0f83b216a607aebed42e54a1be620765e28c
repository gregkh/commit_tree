habanalabs: adjust Kconfig to fix build errors

The driver use the HWMON framework to display various sensors information.
Therefore, CONFIG_HWMON must be included to prevent build errors.

This patch adds "select HWMON" to the driver's Kconfig file to make sure
HWMON is built. In addition, to avoid breaking dependencies, it adds
dependency on HAS_IOMEM because HWMON is dependent on HAS_IOMEM.
