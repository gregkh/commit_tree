iwlwifi: mvm: fix RFH config command with >=10 CPUs

If we have >=10 (logical) CPUs, our command size exceeds the
internal buffer size and the command fails; fix that by using
IWL_HCMD_DFL_NOCOPY for the command that's allocated anyway.

While at it, also fix the leak of cmd, and use struct_size()
to calculate its size.
