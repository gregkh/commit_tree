net: sched: act_csum: Fix csum calc for tagged packets

The csum calculation is different for IPv4/6. For VLAN packets,
tc_skb_protocol returns the VLAN protocol rather than the packet's one
(e.g. IPv4/6), so csum is not calculated. Furthermore, VLAN may not be
stripped so csum is not calculated in this case too. Calculate the
csum for those cases.
