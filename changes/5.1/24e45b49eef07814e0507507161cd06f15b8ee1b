tools uapi x86: Sync vmx.h with the kernel

To pick up the changes from:

  2b27924bb1d4 ("KVM: nVMX: always use early vmcs check when EPT is disabled")

That causes this object in the tools/perf build process to be rebuilt:

  CC       /tmp/build/perf/arch/x86/util/kvm-stat.o

But it isn't using VMX_ABORT_ prefixed constants, so no change in
behaviour.

This silences this perf build warning:

  Warning: Kernel ABI header at 'tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h' differs from latest version at 'arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h'
  diff -u tools/arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h arch/x86/include/uapi/asm/vmx.h
