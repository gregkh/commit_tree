netfilter: reject: skip csum verification for protocols that don't support it

Some protocols have other means to verify the payload integrity
(AH, ESP, SCTP) while others are incompatible with nf_ip(6)_checksum
implementation because checksum is either optional or might be
partial (UDPLITE, DCCP, GRE). Because nf_ip(6)_checksum was used
to validate the packets, ip(6)tables REJECT rules were not capable
to generate ICMP(v6) errors for the protocols mentioned above.

This commit also fixes the incorrect pseudo-header protocol used
for IPv4 packets that carry other transport protocols than TCP or
UDP (pseudo-header used protocol 0 iso the proper value).
