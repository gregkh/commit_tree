RISC-V: Move cpuid to hartid mapping to SMP.

Currently, logical CPU id to physical hartid mapping is defined for both
smp and non-smp configurations. This is not required as we need this
only for smp configuration.  The mapping function can define directly
boot_cpu_hartid for non-smp use case.

The reverse mapping function i.e. hartid to cpuid can be called for any
valid but not booted harts. So it should return default cpu 0 only if it
is a boot hartid.
