asm-generic/io: Pass result of I/O accessor to __io_[p]ar()

The inX() and readX() I/O accessors must enforce ordering against
subsequent calls to the delay() routines, so that a read-back from a
device can be used to postpone a subsequent write to the same device.

On some architectures, including arm64, this ordering can only be
achieved by creating a dependency on the value returned by the I/O
accessor operation, so we need to pass the value we read to the
__io_par() and __io_ar() macros in these cases.
