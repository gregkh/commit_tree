pinctrl: armada-37xx: change suspend/resume time

Armada 3700 PCIe IP relies on the pinctrl IP managed by this
driver. For reasons related to the PCI core's organization when
suspending/resuming, PCI host controller drivers must reconfigure
their register at suspend_noirq()/resume_noirq() which happens after
suspend()/suspend_late() and before resume_early()/resume().

In the current state, after resuming from a suspend to RAM cycle the
PCIe IP is reconfigured before the pinctrl one which produces an
interrupt storm. The solution to support PCIe resume operation is to
change the "priority" of this pinctrl driver PM callbacks to
"_noirq()".
