habanalabs: use u64 when comparing variables' sum to u32_max

This patch fixes two smatch warnings about two if statements that are
always true because of the types of the variables used - u32 when
comparing the sum to u32_max.

The patch changes the types to be u64 so the accumalted sum can be checked
if it is larger than u32_max
