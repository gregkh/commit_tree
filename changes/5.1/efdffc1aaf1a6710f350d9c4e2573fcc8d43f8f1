dmaengine: bcm2835: Drop gratuitous list deletion

The BCM2835 DMA driver deletes a channel from a list upon termination
without having added it to a list first.  Moreover that operation is
protected by a spinlock which isn't taken anywhere else.  These appear
to be remnants of an older version of the driver which accidentally
got mainlined.  Remove the dead code.
