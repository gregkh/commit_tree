nvmem: core: Always reference the device returned by nvmem_device_get()

In nvmem_device_get(), when the device lookup fails with DT it
currently fallback on nvmem_find() which is wrong for two reasons.
First nvmem_find() return NULL when nothing is found instead of an
ERR_PTR. But nvmem_find() also just lookup the device, it doesn't
reference the module and increment the reference count like it is done
in the DT path.

To fix this we replace the call to nvmem_find() with a call to
__nvmem_device_get() which does all the referencing and return a
proper ERR_PTR in case of error.
