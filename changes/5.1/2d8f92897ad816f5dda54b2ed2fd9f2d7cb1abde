drm/meson: Uninstall IRQ handler

meson_drv_unbind() doesn't unregister the IRQ handler, which can lead to
use-after-free if the IRQ fires after unbind:

[   64.656876] Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address ffff000011706dbc
...
[   64.662001] pc : meson_irq+0x18/0x30 [meson_drm]

I'm assuming that a similar problem could happen on the error path of
bind(), so uninstall the IRQ handler there as well.
