net/mlx5e: Allow IPv4 ttl & IPv6 hop_limit rewrite for all L4 protocols

For some protocols we are not allowing IP header rewrite offload, since
the HW is not capable to properly adjust the l4 checksum. However, TTL
& HOPLIMIT modification can be done for all IP protocols, because they
are not part of the pseudo header taken into account for checksum.
