powerpc/eeh: Add include_passed to eeh_clear_pe_frozen_state()

Add a parameter to eeh_clear_pe_frozen_state() that allows
passed-through PEs to be excluded. Update callers to always pass true
so that there is no change in behaviour.

This is to prepare for follow-up work for passed-through devices.
