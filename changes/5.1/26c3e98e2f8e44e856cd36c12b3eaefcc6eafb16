livepatch: Shuffle klp_enable_patch()/klp_disable_patch() code

We are going to simplify the API and code by removing the registration
step. This would require calling init/free functions from enable/disable
ones.

This patch just moves the code to prevent more forward declarations.

This patch does not change the code except for two forward declarations.
