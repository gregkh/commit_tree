smb3: Fix enumerating snapshots to Azure

Some servers (see MS-SMB2 protocol specification
section 3.3.5.15.1) expect that the FSCTL enumerate snapshots
is done twice, with the first query having EXACTLY the minimum
size response buffer requested (16 bytes) which refreshes
the snapshot list (otherwise that and subsequent queries get
an empty list returned).  So had to add code to set
the maximum response size differently for the first snapshot
query (which gets the size needed for the second query which
contains the actual list of snapshots).
