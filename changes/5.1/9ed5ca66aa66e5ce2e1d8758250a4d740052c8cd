powerpc/eeh: Add include_passed to eeh_pe_state_clear()

Add a parameter to eeh_pe_state_clear() that allows passed-through PEs
to be excluded. Update callers to always pass true so that there is no
change in behaviour.

Also refactor to use direct traversal, to allow the removal of some
boilerplate.

This is to prepare for follow-up work for passed-through devices.
