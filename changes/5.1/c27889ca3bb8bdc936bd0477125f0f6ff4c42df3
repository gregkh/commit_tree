drm/ati_pcigart: Fix error code in drm_ati_pcigart_init()

The drm_ati_pcigart_init() function was originally suppose to return one
on success and zero on failure, but these days it returns a mix of
zero, one and -ENOMEM on failure.

This patch cleans it up and modifies the caller so now the function
returns zero on success and negative error codes on failure.
