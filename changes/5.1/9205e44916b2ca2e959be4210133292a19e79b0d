pblk: fix max_io calculation

When calculating the maximun I/O size allowed into the buffer, consider
the write size (ws_opt) used by the write thread in order to cover the
case in which, due to flushes, the mem and subm pointers are disaligned
by (ws_opt - 1). This case currently translates into a stall when
an I/O of the largest possible size is submitted.
