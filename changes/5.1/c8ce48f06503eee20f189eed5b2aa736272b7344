asm-generic: Make time32 syscall numbers optional

We don't want new architectures to even provide the old 32-bit time_t
based system calls any more, or define the syscall number macros.

Add a new __ARCH_WANT_TIME32_SYSCALLS macro that gets enabled for all
existing 32-bit architectures using the generic system call table,
so we don't change any current behavior.
Since this symbol is evaluated in user space as well, we cannot use
a Kconfig CONFIG_* macro but have to define it in uapi/asm/unistd.h.

On 64-bit architectures, the same system call numbers mostly refer to
the system calls we want to keep, as they already pass 64-bit time_t.

As new architectures no longer provide these, we need new exceptions
in checksyscalls.sh.
