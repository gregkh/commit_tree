Input: synaptics-rmi4 - write config register values to the right offset

Currently any changed config register values don't take effect, as the
function to write them back is called with the wrong register offset.

Fixes: ff8f83708b3e (Input: synaptics-rmi4 - add support for 2D
                     sensors and F11)
