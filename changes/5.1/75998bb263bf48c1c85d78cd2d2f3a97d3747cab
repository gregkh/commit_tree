perf stat: Fix --no-scale

The -c option to enable multiplex scaling has been useless for quite
some time because scaling is default.

It's only useful as --no-scale to disable scaling. But the non scaling
code path has bitrotted and doesn't print anything because perf output
code relies on value run/ena information.

Also even when we don't want to scale a value it's still useful to show
its multiplex percentage.

This patch:
  - Fixes help and documentation to show --no-scale instead of -c
  - Removes -c, only keeps the long option because -c doesn't support negatives.
  - Enables running/enabled even with --no-scale
  - And fixes some other problems in the no-scale output.

Before:

  $ perf stat --no-scale -e cycles true

   Performance counter stats for 'true':

       <not counted>      cycles

         0.000984154 seconds time elapsed

After:

  $ ./perf stat --no-scale -e cycles true

   Performance counter stats for 'true':

             706,070      cycles

         0.001219821 seconds time elapsed
