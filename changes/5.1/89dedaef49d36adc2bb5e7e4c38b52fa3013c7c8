libbpf: add libelf dependency to shared library build

The DPDK project is moving forward with its AF_XDP PMD, and during
that process some libbpf issues surfaced [1]: When libbpf was built
as a shared library, libelf was not included in the linking phase.
Since libelf is an internal depedency to libbpf, libelf should be
included. This patch adds '-lelf' to resolve that.
