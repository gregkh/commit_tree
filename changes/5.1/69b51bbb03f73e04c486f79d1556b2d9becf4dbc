net: hns3: fix to stop multiple HNS reset due to the AER changes

The commit bfcb79fca19d
("PCI/ERR: Run error recovery callbacks for all affected devices")
affected the non-fatal error recovery logic for the HNS and RDMA devices.
This is because each HNS PF under PCIe bus receive callbacks
from the AER driver when an error is reported for one of the PF.
This causes unwanted PF resets because
the HNS decides which PF to reset based on the reset type set.
The HNS error handling code sets the reset type based on the hw error
type detected.

This patch provides fix for the above issue for the recovery of
the hw errors in the HNS and RDMA devices.

This patch needs backporting to the kernel v5.0+
