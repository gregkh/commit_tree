arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404: Add QUP I2C and SPI nodes

Define all six QUP controllers, both as SPI and I2C, allowing boards to
enable these as needed. Associated pinmux states are also defined, to
require only pinconf states to be specified by the boards, as they are
enabled.

Note that SPI has not been tested.
