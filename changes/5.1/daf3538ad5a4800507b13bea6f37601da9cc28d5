mm,memory_hotplug: explicitly pass the head to isolate_huge_page

isolate_huge_page() expects we pass the head of hugetlb page to it:

  bool isolate_huge_page(...)
  {
	...
	VM_BUG_ON_PAGE(!PageHead(page), page);
	...
  }

While I really cannot think of any situation where we end up with a
non-head page between hands in do_migrate_range(), let us make sure the
code is as sane as possible by explicitly passing the Head.  Since we
already got the pointer, it does not take us extra effort.
