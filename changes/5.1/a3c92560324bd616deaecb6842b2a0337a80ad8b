block, bfq: reduce threshold for detecting command queueing

bfq simple heuristic from cfq for detecting whether the drive performs
command queueing: check whether the average number of in-flight requests
is above a given threshold. Unfortunately this heuristic does fail to
detect queueing (on drives with queueing) if processes doing I/O are few
and issue I/O with a low depth.

To reduce false negatives, this commit lowers the threshold.
