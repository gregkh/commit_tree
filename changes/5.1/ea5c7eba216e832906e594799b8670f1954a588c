ALSA: hda/realtek: Enable headset MIC of Acer TravelMate B114-21 with ALC233

The Acer TravelMate B114-21 laptop cannot detect and record sound from
headset MIC.  This patch adds the ALC233_FIXUP_ACER_HEADSET_MIC HDA verb
quirk chained with ALC233_FIXUP_ASUS_MIC_NO_PRESENCE pin quirk to fix
this issue.

[ fixed the missing brace and reordered the entry -- tiwai ]
