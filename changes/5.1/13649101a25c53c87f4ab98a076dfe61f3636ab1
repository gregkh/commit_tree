drm/nouveau/bios/ramcfg: fix missing parentheses when calculating RON

Currently, the expression for calculating RON is always going to result
in zero no matter the value of ram->mr[1] because the ! operator has
higher precedence than the shift >> operator.  I believe the missing
parentheses around the expression before appying the ! operator will
result in the desired result.
