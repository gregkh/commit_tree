vrf: Use orig netdev to count Ip6InNoRoutes and a fresh route lookup when sending dest unreach

When there is no route to an IPv6 dest addr, skb_dst(skb) points
to loopback dev in the case of that the IP6CB(skb)->iif is
enslaved to a vrf. This causes Ip6InNoRoutes to be incremented on the
loopback dev. This also causes the lookup to fail on icmpv6_send() and
the dest unreachable to not sent and Ip6OutNoRoutes gets incremented on
the loopback dev.

To reproduce:
* Gateway configuration:
        ip link add dev vrf_258 type vrf table 258
        ip link set dev enp0s9 master vrf_258
        ip addr add 66:1/64 dev enp0s9
        ip -6 route add unreachable default metric 8192 table 258
        sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1
        sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.enp0s9.forwarding=1
* Sender configuration:
        ip addr add 66::2/64 dev enp0s9
        ip -6 route add default via 66::1
and ping 67::1 for example from the sender.

Fix this by counting on the original netdev and reset the skb dst to
force a fresh lookup.

v2: Fix typo of destination address in the repro steps.
v3: Simplify the loopback check (per David Ahern) and use reverse
    Christmas tree format (per David Miller).
