x86/resctrl: Do not repeat rdtgroup mode initialization

When cache allocation is supported and the user creates a new resctrl
resource group, the allocations of the new resource group are
initialized to all regions that it can possibly use. At this time these
regions are all that are shareable by other resource groups as well as
regions that are not currently used. The new resource group's mode is
also initialized to reflect this initialization and set to "shareable".

The new resource group's mode is currently repeatedly initialized within
the loop that configures the hardware with the resource group's default
allocations.

Move the initialization of the resource group's mode outside the
hardware configuration loop. The resource group's mode is now
initialized only once as the final step to reflect that its configured
allocations are "shareable".
