block: add bio_set_polled() helper

For the upcoming async polled IO, we can't sleep allocating requests.
If we do, then we introduce a deadlock where the submitter already
has async polled IO in-flight, but can't wait for them to complete
since polled requests must be active found and reaped.

Utilize the helper in the blockdev DIRECT_IO code.
