ALSA: hda/realtek - add two more pin configuration sets to quirk table

We have two Dell laptops which have the codec 10ec0236 and 10ec0256
respectively, the headset mic on them can't work, need to apply the
quirk of ALC255_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE. So adding their pin
configurations in the pin quirk table.
