scsi: lpfc: Fix default driver parameter collision for allowing NPIV support

The conversion to enable SCSI and NVME fc4 support ran into an issue with
NPIV support. With NVME, NPIV is not currently supported, but with SCSI it
was. The driver reverted to its lowest setting meaning NPIV with SCSI was
not allowed.

Convert the NPIV checks and implementation so that SCSI can continue to
allow NPIV support.
