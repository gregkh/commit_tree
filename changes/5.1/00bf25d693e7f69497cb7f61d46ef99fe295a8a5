y2038: use time32 syscall names on 32-bit

This is the big flip, where all 32-bit architectures set COMPAT_32BIT_TIME
and use the _time32 system calls from the former compat layer instead
of the system calls that take __kernel_timespec and similar arguments.

The temporary redirects for __kernel_timespec, __kernel_itimerspec
and __kernel_timex can get removed with this.

It would be easy to split this commit by architecture, but with the new
generated system call tables, it's easy enough to do it all at once,
which makes it a little easier to check that the changes are the same
in each table.
