LSM: Plumb visibility into optional "enabled" state

In preparation for lifting the "is this LSM enabled?" logic out of the
individual LSMs, pass in any special enabled state tracking (as needed
for SELinux, AppArmor, and LoadPin). This should be an "int" to include
handling any future cases where "enabled" is exposed via sysctl which
has no "bool" type.
