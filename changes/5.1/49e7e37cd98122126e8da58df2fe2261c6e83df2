batman-adv: Prepare framework for vlan genl config

The batman-adv configuration interface was implemented solely using sysfs.
This approach was condemned by non-batadv developers as "huge mistake".
Instead a netlink/genl based implementation was suggested.

Beside the mesh/soft-interface specific configuration, the VLANs on top of
the mesh/soft-interface have configuration settings. The genl interface
reflects this by allowing to get/set it using the vlan specific commands
BATADV_CMD_GET_VLAN/BATADV_CMD_SET_VLAN.

The set command BATADV_CMD_SET_MESH will also notify interested userspace
listeners of the "config" mcast group using the BATADV_CMD_SET_VLAN command
message type that settings might have been changed and what the current
values are.
