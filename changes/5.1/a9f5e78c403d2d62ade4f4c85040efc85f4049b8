netfilter: nf_tables: check the result of dereferencing base_chain->stats

Check the result of dereferencing base_chain->stats, instead of result
of this_cpu_ptr with NULL.

base_chain->stats maybe be changed to NULL when a chain is updated and a
new NULL counter can be attached.

And we do not need to check returning of this_cpu_ptr since
base_chain->stats is from percpu allocator if it is non-NULL,
this_cpu_ptr returns a valid value.

And fix two sparse error by replacing rcu_access_pointer and
rcu_dereference with READ_ONCE under rcu_read_lock.

Thanks for Eric's help to finish this patch.
