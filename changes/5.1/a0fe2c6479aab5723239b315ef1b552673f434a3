linux/kernel.h: Use parentheses around argument in u64_to_user_ptr()

Use parentheses around uses of the argument in u64_to_user_ptr() to
ensure that the cast doesn't apply to part of the argument.

There are existing uses of the macro of the form

  u64_to_user_ptr(A + B)

which expands to

  (void __user *)(uintptr_t)A + B

(the cast applies to the first operand of the addition, the addition
is a pointer addition). This happens to still work as intended, the
semantic difference doesn't cause a difference in behavior.

But I want to use u64_to_user_ptr() with a ternary operator in the
argument, like so:

  u64_to_user_ptr(A ? B : C)

This currently doesn't work as intended.
