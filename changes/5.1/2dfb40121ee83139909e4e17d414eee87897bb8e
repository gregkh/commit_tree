selftests: bpf: prepare for break up of verifier tests

test_verifier.c has grown to be very long (almost 16 kLoC),
and it is very conflict prone since we always add tests at
the end.

Try to break it apart a little bit.  Allow test snippets
to be defined in separate files and include them automatically
into the huge test array.
