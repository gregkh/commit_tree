iommu/vt-d: Implement dma_[un]map_resource()

Currently the Intel IOMMU uses the default dma_[un]map_resource()
implementations does nothing and simply returns the physical address
unmodified.

However, this doesn't create the IOVA entries necessary for addresses
mapped this way to work when the IOMMU is enabled. Thus, when the
IOMMU is enabled, drivers relying on dma_map_resource() will trigger
DMAR errors. We see this when running ntb_transport with the IOMMU
enabled, DMA, and switchtec hardware.

The implementation for intel_map_resource() is nearly identical to
intel_map_page(), we just have to re-create __intel_map_single().
dma_unmap_resource() uses intel_unmap_page() directly as the
functions are identical.
