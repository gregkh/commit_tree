ipv4/route: fail early when inet dev is missing

If a non local multicast packet reaches ip_route_input_rcu() while
the ingress device IPv4 private data (in_dev) is NULL, we end up
doing a NULL pointer dereference in IN_DEV_MFORWARD().

Since the later call to ip_route_input_mc() is going to fail if
!in_dev, we can fail early in such scenario and avoid the dangerous
code path.

v1 -> v2:
 - clarified the commit message, no code changes
