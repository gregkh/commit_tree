drm/amd/display: Re-enable CRC capture following modeset

[Why]
During any modeset the CRTC stream is removed and a new stream is added.
This new stream doesn't carry over CRC capture state if it was
previously set.

[How]
Re-program the stream for CRC capture. The existing DRM callback can
be re-used here for the most part - the only modification needed is
additional locking now that it's called from within commit tail.
