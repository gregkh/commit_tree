xfs: use verifier magic field in dir2 leaf verifiers

The dir2 leaf verifiers share the same underlying structure
verification code, but implement six accessor functions to multiplex
the code across the two verifiers. Further, the magic value isn't
sufficiently abstracted such that the common helper has to manually
fix up the magic from the caller on v5 filesystems.

Use the magic field in the verifier structure to eliminate the
duplicate code and clean this all up. No functional change.
