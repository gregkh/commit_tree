Revert "ACPICA: Clear status of GPEs before enabling them"

Revert commit c8b1917c8987 ("ACPICA: Clear status of GPEs before
enabling them") that causes problems with Thunderbolt controllers
to occur if a dock device is connected at init time (the xhci_hcd
and thunderbolt modules crash which prevents peripherals connected
through them from working).

Commit c8b1917c8987 effectively causes commit ecc1165b8b74 ("ACPICA:
Dispatch active GPEs at init time") to get undone, so the problem
addressed by commit ecc1165b8b74 appears again as a result of it.

Fixes: c8b1917c8987 ("ACPICA: Clear status of GPEs before enabling them")
