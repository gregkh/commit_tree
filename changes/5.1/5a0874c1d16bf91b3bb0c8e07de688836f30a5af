rcu: Remove preemption disabling from expedited CPU selection

It turns out that it is queue_delayed_work_on() rather than
queue_work_on() that has difficulties when used concurrently with
CPU-hotplug removal operations.  It is therefore unnecessary to protect
CPU identification and queue_work_on() with preempt_disable().

This commit therefore removes the preempt_disable() and preempt_enable()
from sync_rcu_exp_select_cpus(), which has the further benefit of reducing
the number of changes that must be maintained in the -rt patchset.
