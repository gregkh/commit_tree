KVM: x86: Emulate MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES on AMD hosts

The CPUID flag ARCH_CAPABILITIES is unconditioinally exposed to host
userspace for all x86 hosts, i.e. KVM advertises ARCH_CAPABILITIES
regardless of hardware support under the pretense that KVM fully
emulates MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES.  Unfortunately, only VMX hosts
handle accesses to MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES (despite KVM_GET_MSRS
also reporting MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES for all hosts).

Move the MSR_IA32_ARCH_CAPABILITIES handling to common x86 code so
that it's emulated on AMD hosts.
