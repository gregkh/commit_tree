habanalabs: soft-reset device if context-switch fails

This patch fix a bug in the driver, where if the TPC or MME remains in
non-IDLE even after all the command submissions are done (due to user bug
or malicious user), then future command submissions will fail in the
context-switch stage and the driver will remain in "stuck" mode.

The fix is to do a soft-reset of the device in case the context-switch
fails, because the device should be IDLE during context-switch. If it is
not IDLE, then something is wrong and we should reset the compute engines.
