ASoC: dpcm: skip missing substream while applying symmetry

If for any reason, the backend does not have the requested substream
(like capture on a playback only backend), the BE will be skipped in
dpcm_be_dai_startup().

However, dpcm_apply_symmetry() does not skip those BE and will
dereference the be_substream (NULL) pointer anyway.

Like in dpcm_be_dai_startup(), just skip those BE.
