new helpers: vfs_create_mount(), fc_mount()

Create a new helper, vfs_create_mount(), that creates a detached vfsmount
object from an fs_context that has a superblock attached to it.

Almost all uses will be paired with immediately preceding vfs_get_tree();
add a helper for such combination.

Switch vfs_kern_mount() to use this.

NOTE: mild behaviour change; passing NULL as 'device name' to
something like procfs will change /proc/*/mountstats - "device none"
instead on "no device".  That is consistent with /proc/mounts et.al.

[do'h - EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL slipped in by mistake; removed]
[AV -- remove confused comment from vfs_create_mount()]
[AV -- removed the second argument]
