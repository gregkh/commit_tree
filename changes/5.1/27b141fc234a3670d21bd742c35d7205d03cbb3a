s390: ctcm: fix ctcm_new_device error return code

clang points out that the return code from this function is
undefined for one of the error paths:

../drivers/s390/net/ctcm_main.c:1595:7: warning: variable 'result' is used uninitialized whenever 'if' condition is true
      [-Wsometimes-uninitialized]
                if (priv->channel[direction] == NULL) {
                    ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../drivers/s390/net/ctcm_main.c:1638:9: note: uninitialized use occurs here
        return result;
               ^~~~~~
../drivers/s390/net/ctcm_main.c:1595:3: note: remove the 'if' if its condition is always false
                if (priv->channel[direction] == NULL) {
                ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
../drivers/s390/net/ctcm_main.c:1539:12: note: initialize the variable 'result' to silence this warning
        int result;
                  ^

Make it return -ENODEV here, as in the related failure cases.
gcc has a known bug in underreporting some of these warnings
when it has already eliminated the assignment of the return code
based on some earlier optimization step.
