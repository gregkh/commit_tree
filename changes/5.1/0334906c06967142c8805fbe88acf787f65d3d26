cpufreq: kryo: Release OPP tables on module removal

Commit 5ad7346b4ae2 ("cpufreq: kryo: Add module remove and exit") made
it possible to build the kryo cpufreq driver as a module, but it failed
to release all the resources, i.e. OPP tables, when the module is
unloaded.

This patch fixes it by releasing the OPP tables, by calling
dev_pm_opp_put_supported_hw() for them, from the
qcom_cpufreq_kryo_remove() routine. The array of pointers to the OPP
tables is also allocated dynamically now in qcom_cpufreq_kryo_probe(),
as the pointers will be required while releasing the resources.

Compile tested only.
