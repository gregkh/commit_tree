scsi: sd: Quiesce warning if device does not report optimal I/O size

Commit a83da8a4509d ("scsi: sd: Optimal I/O size should be a multiple
of physical block size") split one conditional into several separate
statements in an effort to provide more accurate warning messages when
a device reports a nonsensical value. However, this reorganization
accidentally dropped the precondition of the reported value being
larger than zero. This lead to a warning getting emitted on devices
that do not report an optimal I/O size at all.

Remain silent if a device does not report an optimal I/O size.
