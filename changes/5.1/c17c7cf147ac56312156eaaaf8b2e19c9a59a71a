usb: typec: tcpm: Remove unused functions

tcpm_update_source_capabilities() and tcpm_update_sink_capabilities()
are not used anywhere, and I don't recall why I introduced those functions
in the first place. Effectively that means that we don't know if they even
work, or ever did. Lets remove them.
