net: devlink: turn devlink into a built-in

Being able to build devlink as a module causes growing pains.
First all drivers had to add a meta dependency to make sure
they are not built in when devlink is built as a module.  Now
we are struggling to invoke ethtool compat code reliably.

Make devlink code built-in, users can still not build it at
all but the dynamically loadable module option is removed.
