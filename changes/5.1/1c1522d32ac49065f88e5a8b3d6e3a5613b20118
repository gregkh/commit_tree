EDAC, mce_amd: Print ExtErrorCode and description on a single line

Save a log line by printing the extended error code and the description
on a single line. This is similar to how errors are printed in other
subsystems, e.g. "#, description". If we don't have a valid description
then only the number/code is printed.
