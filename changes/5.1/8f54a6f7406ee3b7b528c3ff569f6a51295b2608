powerpc/kconfig: make _etext and data areas alignment configurable on 8xx

On 8xx, large pages (512kb or 8M) are used to map kernel linear
memory. Aligning to 8M reduces TLB misses as only 8M pages are used
in that case. We make 8M the default for data.

This patchs allows the user to do it via Kconfig.
