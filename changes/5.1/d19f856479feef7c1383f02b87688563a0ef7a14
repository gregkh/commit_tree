perf bpf: Add bpf_map dumper

At some point I'll suggest moving this to libbpf, for now I'll
experiment with ways to dump BPF maps set by events in 'perf trace',
starting with a very basic dumper for the current very limited needs
of the augmented_raw_syscalls code: dumping booleans.

Having functions that apply to the map keys and values and do table
lookup in things like syscall id to string tables should come next.
