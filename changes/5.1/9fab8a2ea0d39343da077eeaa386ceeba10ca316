drm/i915: Removing polling for struct_mutex from vmap shrinker

The wait-for-idle used from within the shrinker_lock_uninterruptible
depends on the struct_mutex locking state being known and declared to
i915_request_wait(). As it is conceivable that we reach the vmap
notifier from underneath struct_mutex (and so keep on relying on the
mutex_trylock_recursive), we should not blindly call i915_request_wait.

In the process we can remove the dubious polling to acquire
struct_mutex, and simply act, or not, on a successful trylock.
