security: keys: annotate implicit fall throughs

There is a plan to build the kernel with -Wimplicit-fallthrough and
these places in the code produced warnings (W=1). Fix them up.

This commit remove the following warnings:

  security/keys/request_key.c:293:7: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  security/keys/request_key.c:298:7: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  security/keys/request_key.c:307:7: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
