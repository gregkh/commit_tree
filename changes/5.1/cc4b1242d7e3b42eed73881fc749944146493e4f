vfs: fix preadv64v2 and pwritev64v2 compat syscalls with offset == -1

The preadv2 and pwritev2 syscalls are supposed to emulate the readv and
writev syscalls when offset == -1. Therefore the compat code should
check for offset before calling do_compat_preadv64 and
do_compat_pwritev64. This is the case for the preadv2 and pwritev2
syscalls, but handling of offset == -1 is missing in their 64-bit
equivalent.

This patch fixes that, calling do_compat_readv and do_compat_writev when
offset == -1. This fixes the following glibc tests on x32:
 - misc/tst-preadvwritev2
 - misc/tst-preadvwritev64v2
