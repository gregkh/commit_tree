bpf, libbpf: fixing leak when kernel does not support btf

We could end up in situation when we have object file w/ all btf
info, but kernel does not support btf yet. In this situation
currently libbpf just set obj->btf to NULL w/o freeing it first.
This patch is fixing it by making sure to run btf__free first.
