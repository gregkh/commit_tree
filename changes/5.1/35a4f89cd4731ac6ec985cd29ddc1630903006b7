arm64: dts: zcu100-revC: Give wifi some time after power-on

Somewhere along recent changes to power control of the wl1831, power-on
became very unreliable on the Ultra96, failing like this:

wl1271_sdio: probe of mmc2:0001:1 failed with error -16
wl1271_sdio: probe of mmc2:0001:2 failed with error -16

After playing with some dt parameters and comparing to other users of
this chip, it turned out we need some power-on delay to make things
stable again. In contrast to those other users which define 200 ms,
Ultra96 is already happy with 10 ms.
