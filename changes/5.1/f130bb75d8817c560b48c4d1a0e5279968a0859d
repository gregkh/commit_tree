iwlwifi: add FW recovery flow

Add new API and TLV for the ability to send commands in the beginning
and end of reset flow.

The full flow of recovery is:

1. While loading FW, get address (from the TLV) of target buffer
   to read in case of reset
2. If an error/assert happens read the address data from step 1.
3. Reset the HW and load the FW.
4. Send the data read in step 2.
5. Add station keys
6. Send notification to FW that reset flow is done.

The main use of the recovery flow is for support in PN/SN recovery
when offloaded
