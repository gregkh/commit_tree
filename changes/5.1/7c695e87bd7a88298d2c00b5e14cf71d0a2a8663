ARM: dts: omap4-droid4: Configure wlcore wakeirq

With wlcore supporting optional wakeirqs, we can configure it
for droid 4. This makes ssh connection usable with the SoC
entering deeper idle states.

Let's configure a wakeirq both for the wlcore GPIO and the SDIO
dat1 pin in case wlcore starts supporting SDIO dat1 interrupt at
some point.

And let's also add the missing keep-power-in-suspend while at it.
