sky2: Disable MSI on Dell Inspiron 1545 and Gateway P-79

Some sky2 chips fire IRQ after S3, before the driver is fully resumed:
[ 686.804877] do_IRQ: 1.37 No irq handler for vector

This is likely a platform bug that device isn't fully quiesced during
S3. Use MSI-X, maskable MSI or INTx can prevent this issue from
happening.

Since MSI-X and maskable MSI are not supported by this device, fallback
to use INTx on affected platforms.
