ARM: davinci: aintc: remove the timer-specific irq_set_handler()

I've been unable to figure out exactly why, but the IRQ_TINT1_TINT34
interrupt is being handled as level irq and it's configured in the
irq chip driver instead of set by the irq_set_type() callback.

Since this is probably some legacy hack for out-of-tree code - remove it.
