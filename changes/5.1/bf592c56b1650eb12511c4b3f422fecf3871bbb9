max17042_battery: fix potential use-after-free on device remove

The work which is scheduled on a POR boot is potentially left
pending or running until after the device module is removed,
which could result in a use-after-free.

Fix by registering a cancel/sync callback, which gets executed as
part of standard resource unwinding.

This issue was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
