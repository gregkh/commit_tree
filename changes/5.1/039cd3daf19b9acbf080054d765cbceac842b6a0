IB/hfi1: Increment the retry timeout value for TID RDMA READ request

The RC retry timeout value is based on the estimated time for the
response packet to come back. However, for TID RDMA READ request, due
to the use of header suppression, the driver is normally not notified
for each incoming response packet until the last TID RDMA READ response
packet. Consequently, the retry timeout value should be extended to
cover the transaction time for the entire length of a segment (default
256K) instead of that for a single packet. This patch addresses the
issue by introducing new retry timer functions to account for multiple
packets and wrapper functions for backward compatibility.
