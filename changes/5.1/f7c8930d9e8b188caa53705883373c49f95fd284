drm/amd/display: Fix deadlock with display during hanged ring recovery.

When ring hang happens amdgpu_dm_commit_planes during flip is holding
the BO reserved and then stack waiting for fences to signal in
reservation_object_wait_timeout_rcu (which won't signal because there
was a hnag). Then when we try to shutdown display block during reset
recovery from drm_atomic_helper_suspend we also try to reserve the BO
from dm_plane_helper_cleanup_fb ending in deadlock.
Also remove useless WARN_ON
