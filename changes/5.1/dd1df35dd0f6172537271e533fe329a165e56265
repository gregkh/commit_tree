media: soc_camera: Depend on BROKEN

This patch makes the SoC camera framework as well as effectively the few
remaining sensor drivers depend on BROKEN, rendering it uncompileable
without changes in Kconfig.

The purpose is to leave the code around if someone wishes to convert the
drivers to the modern day V4L2 sub-device framework without having to go
to see development history in git.
