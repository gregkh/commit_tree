serial: sprd: Modify the baud rate calculation formula

When the source clock is not divisible by the expected baud rate and
the remainder is not less than half of the expected baud rate, the old
formular will round up the frequency division coefficient. This will
make the actual baud rate less than the expected value and can not meet
the external transmission requirements.

Thus this patch modifies the baud rate calculation formula to support
the serial controller output the maximum baud rate.
