platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Avoid a u32 overflow

The register (SLP_S0_RES) at offset slp_s0_offset is a 32 bit register.
The pmc_core_adjust_slp_s0_step() could overflow the u32 value while
returning it after adjusting the step. Thus change to u64, this is
already accounted for in debugfs attribute (that wants to output a
64 bit value).
