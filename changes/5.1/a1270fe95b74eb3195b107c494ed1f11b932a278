bpf: User program for testing HBM

The program nrm creates a cgroup and attaches a BPF program to the
cgroup for testing HBM (Host Bandwidth Manager) for egress traffic.
One still needs to create network traffic. This can be done through
netesto, netperf or iperf3.
A follow-up patch contains a script to create traffic.

USAGE: hbm [-d] [-l] [-n <id>] [-r <rate>] [-s] [-t <secs>]
           [-w] [-h] [prog]
  Where:
   -d        Print BPF trace debug buffer
   -l        Also limit flows doing loopback
   -n <#>    To create cgroup "/hbm#" and attach prog. Default is /nrm1
             This is convenient when testing HBM in more than 1 cgroup
   -r <rate> Rate limit in Mbps
   -s        Get HBM stats (marked, dropped, etc.)
   -t <time> Exit after specified seconds (deault is 0)
   -w        Work conserving flag. cgroup can increase its bandwidth
             beyond the rate limit specified while there is available
             bandwidth. Current implementation assumes there is only
             NIC (eth0), but can be extended to support multiple NICs.
             Currrently only supported for egress. Note, this is just
	     a proof of concept.
   -h        Print this info
   prog      BPF program file name. Name defaults to hbm_out_kern.o

Management" presented at the 2018 Linux Plumbers Conference, Networking Track
