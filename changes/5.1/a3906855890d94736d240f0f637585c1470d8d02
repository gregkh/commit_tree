vfio/spapr_tce: Skip unsetting already unset table

VFIO TCE IOMMU v2 owns IOMMU tables. When we detach an IOMMU group from
a container, we need to unset these tables from the group which we do by
calling unset_window(). We also unset tables when removing a DMA window
via the VFIO_IOMMU_SPAPR_TCE_REMOVE ioctl.

The window removal checks if the table actually exists (hidden inside
tce_iommu_find_table()) but the group detaching does not so the user
may see duplicating messages:
pci 0009:03     : [PE# fd] Removing DMA window #0
pci 0009:03     : [PE# fd] Removing DMA window #1
pci 0009:03     : [PE# fd] Removing DMA window #0
pci 0009:03     : [PE# fd] Removing DMA window #1

At the moment this is not a problem as the second invocation
of unset_window() writes zeroes to the HW registers again and exits early
as there is no table.
