brcmfmac: rework bphy_err() to take struct brcmf_pub argument

This macro will be used in more places not just the cfg80211.c. It makes
sense to pass some common struct to it as "struct wiphy" is mostly
referenced in cfg80211 code only.

A very common one (used above the bus abstraction layer) is struct
brcmf_pub. Many functions already keep reference to it which will make
using bphy_err() simpler. It should also allow extending that macro's
logic if it's ever needed.

This improves code recently added in the commit 3ef005b82e2a ("brcmfmac:
add bphy_err() and use it in the cfg80211.c").
