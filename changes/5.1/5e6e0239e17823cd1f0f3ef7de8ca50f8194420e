habanalabs: make functions static or declare them

This patch fixes the below sparse warnings by either making the functions
static or by adding a declaration in the relevant header file.

In addition, the patch removes goya_mmap completely as it doesn't add any
additional benefit.

Fixes the following sparse warnings:
