rtc: pm8xxx: fix unintended sign extension

Shifting a u8 by 24 will cause the value to be promoted to an integer. If
the top bit of the u8 is set then the following conversion to an unsigned
long will sign extend the value causing the upper 32 bits to be set in
the result.

Fix this by casting the u8 value to an unsigned long before the shift.
