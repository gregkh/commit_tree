mm/memory_hotplug: do not unlock after failing to take the device_hotplug_lock

When adding memory by probing a memory block in the sysfs interface,
there is an obvious issue where we will unlock the device_hotplug_lock
when we failed to takes it.

That issue was introduced in 8df1d0e4a265 ("mm/memory_hotplug: make
add_memory() take the device_hotplug_lock").

We should drop out in time when failing to take the device_hotplug_lock.
