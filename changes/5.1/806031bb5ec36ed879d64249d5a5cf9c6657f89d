mm, migrate: immediately fail migration of a page with no migration handler

Pages with no migration handler use a fallback handler which sometimes
works and sometimes persistently retries.  A historical example was
blockdev pages but there are others such as odd refcounting when
page->private is used.  These are retried multiple times which is
wasteful during compaction so this patch will fail migration faster
unless the caller specifies MIGRATE_SYNC.

This is not expected to help THP allocation success rates but it did
reduce latencies very slightly in some cases.

The 2-socket results are not materially different.  Scan rates are
similar as expected.
