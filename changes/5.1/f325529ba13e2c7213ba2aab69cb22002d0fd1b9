drm: rcar-du: Convert live DT patches to sugar syntax

Using overlay sugar syntax makes the DTS files easier to read (and
write).

Overlay syntactic sugar for generating target-path fragments is
supported by the version of dtc supplied with the kernel since commit
50aafd60898a8b3e ("scripts/dtc: Update to upstream version
v1.4.6-21-g84e414b0b5bc").
