Btrfs: drop useless LIST_HEAD in merge_reloc_root

Drop LIST_HEAD where the variable it declares is never used.

The uses were removed in 3fd0a5585eb9 ("Btrfs: Metadata ENOSPC
handling for balance"), but not the declaration.

The semantic patch that fixes this problem is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
identifier x;
@@
- LIST_HEAD(x);
  ... when != x
// </smpl>
