samples: bpf: fix: broken sample regarding removed function

Currently, running sample "task_fd_query" and "tracex3" occurs the
following error. On kernel v5.0-rc* this sample will be unavailable
due to the removal of function 'blk_start_request' at commit "a1ce35f".
(function removed, as "Single Queue IO scheduler" no longer exists)

$ sudo ./task_fd_query
failed to create kprobe 'blk_start_request' error 'No such file or
directory'

This commit will change the function 'blk_start_request' to
'blk_mq_start_request' to fix the broken sample.
