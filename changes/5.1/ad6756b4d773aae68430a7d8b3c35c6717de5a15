drm/amd/display: Shift dc link aux to aux_payload

[Why]
aux_payload should be the struct used inside dc to start
aux transactions.  This will allow the old aux interface
to be seamlessly replaced.

[How]
Add three fields to aux_payload: reply, mot, defer_delay
This will mean that aux_payload has all data required
to submit a request.  Shift dc_link to use this struct
