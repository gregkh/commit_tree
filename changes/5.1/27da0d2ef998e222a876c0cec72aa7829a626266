appletalk: Fix compile regression

A bugfix just broke compilation of appletalk when CONFIG_SYSCTL
is disabled:

In file included from net/appletalk/ddp.c:65:
net/appletalk/ddp.c: In function 'atalk_init':
include/linux/atalk.h:164:34: error: expected expression before 'do'
 #define atalk_register_sysctl()  do { } while(0)
                                  ^~
net/appletalk/ddp.c:1934:7: note: in expansion of macro 'atalk_register_sysctl'
  rc = atalk_register_sysctl();

This is easier to avoid by using conventional inline functions
as stubs rather than macros. The header already has inline
functions for other purposes, so I'm changing over all the
macros for consistency.
