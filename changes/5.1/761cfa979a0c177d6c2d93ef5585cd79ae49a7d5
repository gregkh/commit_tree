net: ks8851: Reassert reset pin if chip ID check fails

Commit 73fdeb82e963 ("net: ks8851: Add optional vdd_io regulator and
reset gpio") amended the ks8851 driver to briefly assert the chip's
reset pin on probe. It also amended the probe routine's error path to
reassert the reset pin if a subsequent initialization step fails.

However the commit misplaced reassertion of the reset pin in the error
path such that it is not performed if the check of the Chip ID and
Enable Register (CIDER) fails. The error path is therefore slightly
asymmetrical to the probe routine's body. Fix it.
