init/calibrate.c: provide proper prototype

Sparse issues a warning:

    CHECK   init/calibrate.c
  init/calibrate.c:271:28: warning: symbol 'calibration_delay_done' was not declared. Should it be static?

The actual issue is that it's a __weak symbol that archs can override
(in fact, ARM does so), but no prototype is provided.  Let's provide one
to prevent surprises.
