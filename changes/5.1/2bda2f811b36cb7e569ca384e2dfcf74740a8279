mtd: spi-nor: add octal read flag for flash mt35xu512aba

Add octal read flag for flash mt35xu512aba.
This flash, mt35xu512aba, is only complaint to SFDP JESD216B and does
not seem to support newer JESD216C standard that provides auto
detection of Octal mode capabilities and opcodes. Therefore, this
capability is manually added using new SPI_NOR_OCTAL_READ flag.
