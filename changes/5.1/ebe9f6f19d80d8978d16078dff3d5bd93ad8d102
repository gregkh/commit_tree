acpi/nfit: Fix bus command validation

Commit 11189c1089da "acpi/nfit: Fix command-supported detection" broke
ND_CMD_CALL for bus-level commands. The "func = cmd" assumption is only
valid for:

    ND_CMD_ARS_CAP
    ND_CMD_ARS_START
    ND_CMD_ARS_STATUS
    ND_CMD_CLEAR_ERROR

The function number otherwise needs to be pulled from the command
payload for:

    NFIT_CMD_TRANSLATE_SPA
    NFIT_CMD_ARS_INJECT_SET
    NFIT_CMD_ARS_INJECT_CLEAR
    NFIT_CMD_ARS_INJECT_GET

Update cmd_to_func() for the bus case and call it in the common path.
