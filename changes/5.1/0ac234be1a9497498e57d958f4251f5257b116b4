ACPI / APEI: Switch estatus pool to use vmalloc memory

The ghes code is careful to parse and round firmware's advertised
memory requirements for CPER records, up to a maximum of 64K.
However when ghes_estatus_pool_expand() does its work, it splits
the requested size into PAGE_SIZE granules.

This means if firmware generates 5K of CPER records, and correctly
describes this in the table, __process_error() will silently fail as it
is unable to allocate more than PAGE_SIZE.

Switch the estatus pool to vmalloc() memory. On x86 vmalloc() memory
may fault and be fixed up by vmalloc_fault(). To prevent this call
vmalloc_sync_all() before an NMI handler could discover the memory.
