clocksource/arm_arch_timer: Store physical timer IRQ number for KVM on VHE

A host running in VHE mode gets the EL2 physical timer as its time
source (accessed using the EL1 sysreg accessors, which get re-directed
to the EL2 sysregs by VHE).

The EL1 physical timer remains unused by the host kernel, allowing us to
pass that on directly to a KVM guest and saves us from emulating this
timer for the guest on VHE systems.

Store the EL1 Physical Timer's IRQ number in
struct arch_timer_kvm_info on VHE systems to allow KVM to use it.
