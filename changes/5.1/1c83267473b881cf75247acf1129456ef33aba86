nvmem: core: Fix cell lookup when no cell is found

If the cell list is not empty and nvmem_find_cell_by_node/name() is
called for a cell that is not present in the list they will return an
invalid pointer instead of NULL. This happen because
list_for_each_entry() stop once it reach the list head again, but as
the list head is not contained in a struct nvmem_cell the iteration
variable then contains an invalid value.

This is easily solved by using a variable to iterate over the list and
one to return the cell found.
