ARCv2: Add explcit unaligned access support (and ability to disable too)

As of today we enable unaligned access unconditionally on ARCv2.
Do this under a Kconfig option to allow disable it for test, benchmarking
etc. Also while at it

  - Select HAVE_EFFICIENT_UNALIGNED_ACCESS
  - Although gcc defaults to unaligned access (since GNU 2018.03), add the
    right toggles for enabling or disabling as appropriate
  - update bootlog to prints both HW feature status (exists, enabled/disabled)
    and SW status (used / not used).
  - wire up the relaxed memcpy for unaligned access
