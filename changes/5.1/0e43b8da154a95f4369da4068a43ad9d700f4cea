gpu: host1x: Use correct semantics for HOST1X_CHANNEL_DMAEND

The HOST1X_CHANNEL_DMAEND is an offset relative to the value written to
the HOST1X_CHANNEL_DMASTART register, but it is currently treated as an
absolute address. This can cause SMMU faults if the CDMA fetches past a
pushbuffer's IOMMU mapping.

Properly setting the DMAEND prevents the CDMA from fetching beyond that
address and avoid such issues. This is currently not observed because a
whole (almost) page of essentially scratch space absorbs any excessive
prefetching by CDMA. However, changing the number of slots in the push
buffer can trigger these SMMU faults.
