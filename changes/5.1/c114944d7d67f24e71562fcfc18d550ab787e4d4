USB: w1 ds2490: Fix bug caused by improper use of altsetting array

The syzkaller USB fuzzer spotted a slab-out-of-bounds bug in the
ds2490 driver.  This bug is caused by improper use of the altsetting
array in the usb_interface structure (the array's entries are not
always stored in numerical order), combined with a naive assumption
that all interfaces probed by the driver will have the expected number
of altsettings.

The bug can be fixed by replacing references to the possibly
non-existent intf->altsetting[alt] entry with the guaranteed-to-exist
intf->cur_altsetting entry.
