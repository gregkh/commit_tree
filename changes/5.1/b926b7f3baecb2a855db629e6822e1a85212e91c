mm/resource: Move HMM pr_debug() deeper into resource code

HMM consumes physical address space for its own use, even
though nothing is mapped or accessible there.  It uses a
special resource description (IORES_DESC_DEVICE_PRIVATE_MEMORY)
to uniquely identify these areas.

When HMM consumes address space, it makes a best guess about
what to consume.  However, it is possible that a future memory
or device hotplug can collide with the reserved area.  In the
case of these conflicts, there is an error message in
register_memory_resource().

Later patches in this series move register_memory_resource()
from using request_resource_conflict() to __request_region().
Unfortunately, __request_region() does not return the conflict
like the previous function did, which makes it impossible to
check for IORES_DESC_DEVICE_PRIVATE_MEMORY in a conflicting
resource.

Instead of warning in register_memory_resource(), move the
check into the core resource code itself (__request_region())
where the conflicting resource _is_ available.  This has the
added bonus of producing a warning in case of HMM conflicts
with devices *or* RAM address space, as opposed to the RAM-
only warnings that were there previously.
