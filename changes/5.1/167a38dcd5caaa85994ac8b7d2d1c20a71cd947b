cpufreq: Pass updated policy to driver ->setpolicy() callback

The invocation of the ->setpolicy() cpufreq driver callback should
be equivalent to calling cpufreq_governor_limits(policy) for drivers
with internal governors, but in fact it isn't so, because the
temporary new_policy object is passed to it instead of the updated
policy.

That is a bit confusing, so make cpufreq_set_policy() pass the
updated policy to the driver ->setpolicy() callback.

No intentional changes of behavior.
