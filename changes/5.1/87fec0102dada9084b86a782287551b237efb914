crypto: bcm - remove -I. header search path and unused macro define

The header search path -I. in kernel Makefiles is very suspicious;
it allows the compiler to search for headers in the top of $(srctree),
where obviously no header file exists.

'git grep BCMDRIVER' has no hit. So, this macro is not referenced.

I was able to build this driver without the extra compiler options.
