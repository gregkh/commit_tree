IB/hfi1: Add static trace for TID RDMA WRITE protocol

This patch makes the following changes to the static trace:
1. Adds the decoding of TID RDMA WRITE packets in IB header trace;
2. Adds trace events for various stages of the TID RDMA WRITE
protocol. These events provide a fine-grained control for monitoring
and debugging the hfi1 driver in the filed.
