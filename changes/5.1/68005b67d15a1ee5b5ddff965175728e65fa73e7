powerpc/dma: use the generic direct mapping bypass

Now that we've switched all the powerpc nommu and swiotlb methods to
use the generic dma_direct_* calls we can remove these ops vectors
entirely and rely on the common direct mapping bypass that avoids
indirect function calls entirely.  This also allows to remove a whole
lot of boilerplate code related to setting up these operations.
