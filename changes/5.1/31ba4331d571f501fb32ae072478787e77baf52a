SMB3: passthru query info doesn't check for SMB3 FSCTL passthru

The passthrough queries from user space tools like smbinfo can be either
SMB3 QUERY_INFO or SMB3 FSCTL, but we are not checking for the latter.
Temporarily we return EOPNOTSUPP for SMB3 FSCTL passthrough requests
but once compounding fsctls is fixed can enable.
