RISC-V: Implement compile-time fixed mappings

This patch implements compile-time virtual to physical mappings. These
compile-time fixed mappings can be used by earlycon, ACPI, and early
ioremap for creating fixed mappings when FIX_EARLYCON_MEM=y.

To start with, we have enabled compile-time fixed mappings for earlycon.
