habanalabs: Dissociate RAZWI info from event types

This patch provides a workaround for a H/W bug in the RAZWI logger in
Goya. The logger doesn't recognize the initiator correctly and as a
result, accesses from one initiator are reported that were coming from a
different initiator.

The WA is to print the error information from the event entries we receive
without looking at the RAZWI logger at all.
