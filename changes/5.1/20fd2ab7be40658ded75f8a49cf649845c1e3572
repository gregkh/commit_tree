drm/i915/icl: remove dpll from clk_sel

We should not pass DPLL_ID_ICL_DPLL0 or DPLL_ID_ICL_DPLL1 to this
function because the path is only taken for non-combophy ports. Let the
warning trigger if improper value is given.

While at it, rename the function to match the register name we are
trying to program.

v2: fix typo in comment
