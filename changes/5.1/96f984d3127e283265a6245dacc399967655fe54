ACPI / scan: Create platform device for BSG2150 ACPI nodes

The Point of View TAB-P1006W-232-3G tablet has an ACPI firmware node with
a HID of BSG2150 describing the 2 Bosch sensors used in the device a
BMC150 compatible accelerometer and a BMC150 compatible magnetometer.

The ACPI firmware node actually contains 3 I2cSerialBusV2 resources,
but this seems to be a copy and paste job from the BSG1160 firmware node
on other devices, since there is no i2c-client listening to the 0x68
address listed in the third resource and the 0x68 address is identical
to the address of the third resource in the BSG1160 nodes, where as the
other 2 addresses are different.

Add the ID to the I2C multi instantiate list, so that the
i2c-multi-instantiate.c driver can handle it;

And add the necessary info to the i2c-multi-instantiate.c driver to
enumerate all I2C slaves correctly.

To avoid triggering the:

        if (i < multi->num_clients) {
                dev_err(dev, "Error finding driver, idx %d\n", i);

Error this commit lists the 3th device in the i2c_inst_data with a
type of "bsg2150_dummy_dev".
