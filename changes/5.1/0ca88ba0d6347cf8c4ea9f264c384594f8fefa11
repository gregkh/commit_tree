drm/i915: Always allocate an object/vma for the HWSP

Currently we only allocate an object and vma if we are using a GGTT
virtual HWSP, and a plain struct page for a physical HWSP. For
convenience later on with global timelines, it will be useful to always
have the status page being tracked by a struct i915_vma. Make it so.
