lib: objagg: implement optimization hints assembly and use hints for object creation

Implement simple greedy algo to find more optimized root-delta tree for
a given objagg instance. This "hints" can be used by a driver to:
1) check if the hints are better (driver's choice) than the original
   objagg tree. Driver does comparison of objagg stats and hints stats.
2) use the hints to create a new objagg instance which will construct
   the root-delta tree according to the passed hints. Currently, only a
   simple greedy algorithm is implemented. Basically it finds the roots
   according to the maximal possible user count including deltas.
