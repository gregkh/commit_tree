virt: vbox: Implement passing requestor info to the host for VirtualBox 6.0.x

VirtualBox 6.0.x has a new feature where the guest kernel driver passes
info about the origin of the request (e.g. userspace or kernelspace) to
the hypervisor.

If we do not pass this information then when running the 6.0.x userspace
guest-additions tools on a 6.0.x host, some requests will get denied
with a VERR_VERSION_MISMATCH error, breaking vboxservice.service and
the mounting of shared folders marked to be auto-mounted.

This commit implements passing the requestor info to the host, fixing this.
