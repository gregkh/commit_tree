perf script python: add Python3 support to check-perf-trace.py

Support both Python 2 and Python 3 in the check-perf-trace.py script.

There may be differences in the ordering of output lines due to
differences in dictionary ordering etc.  However the format within lines
should be unchanged.

The use of from __future__ implies the minimum supported version of
Python2 is now v2.6
