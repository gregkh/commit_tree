tools/testing/selftests/sysctl/sysctl.sh: add tests for >32-bit values written to 32-bit integers

Patch series "sysctl: fix range-checking in do_proc_dointvec_minmax_conv()", v2.

After being left with an unusable system after a typo executing
something like 'echo $((1<<24)) > /proc/sys/vm/max_map_count', I found
that do_proc_dointvec_minmax_conv() was missing a check to ensure that
the converted value actually fits in an int.

The first of the following patches enhances the sysctl selftest such
that it detects this problem; the second provides a minimal fix
(suitable for -stable) such that the selftest passes.  The third patch
then performs a more thorough refactoring to eliminate the code
duplication that led to the bug in the first place (maintaining the
passing status of the selftest).

This patch (of 3):

At present this exposes a bug in do_proc_dointvec_minmax_conv() (it
fails to check for values that are too wide to fit in an int).
