EDAC/mce_amd: Decode MCA_STATUS[Scrub] bit

Previous AMD systems have had a bit in MCA_STATUS to indicate that an
error was detected on a scrub operation. However, this bit was defined
differently within different banks and families/models.

Starting with Family 17h, MCA_STATUS[40] is either Reserved/Read-as-Zero
or defined as "Scrub", for all MCA banks and CPU models. Therefore, this
bit can be defined as the "Scrub" bit.

Define MCA_STATUS[40] as "Scrub" and decode it in the AMD MCE decoding
module for Family 17h and newer systems.
