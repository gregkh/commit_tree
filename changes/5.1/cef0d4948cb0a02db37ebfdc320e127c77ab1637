HID: debug: fix race condition with between rdesc_show() and device removal

There is a race condition that could happen if hid_debug_rdesc_show()
is running while hdev is in the process of going away (device removal,
system suspend, etc) which could result in NULL pointer dereference:

	 BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at 0000000783316040

Grab driver_input_lock to make sure the input device exists throughout the
whole process of dumping the rdesc.
