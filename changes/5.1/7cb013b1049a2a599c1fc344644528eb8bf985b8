media: ov5640: Set JPEG output timings when outputting JPEG data

When compression is turned on, the on-bus data is framed according to
the compression mode, and the height and width set in VFIFO_VSIZE and
VFIFO_HSIZE. If these are not updated correctly, the sensor will send
data framed in a manner unexpected by the capture interface, such as
having more bytes per line than expected, and having the extra data
dropped. This ultimately results in corrupted data.

Set the two values when the media bus is configured for JPEG data,
meaning the sensor would be in JPEG mode.
