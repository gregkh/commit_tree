Btrfs: do not overwrite error return value in the device replace ioctl

If the call to btrfs_dev_replace_by_ioctl() failed we would overwrite the
error returned to user space with -EFAULT if the call to copy_to_user()
failed as well. Fix that by calling copy_to_user() only if no error
happened before or a device replace operation was canceled.
