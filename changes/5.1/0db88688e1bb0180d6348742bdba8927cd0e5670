mfd: wm8350-core: Drop unused module infrastructure from non-modular code

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/mfd/Kconfig:config MFD_WM8350
drivers/mfd/Kconfig:    bool

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple traces of modular infrastructure use, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

We delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.

We replace module.h with init.h and export.h ; the latter since the
file does export some symbols.

Previous demodularizaion work has made wm8350_device_exit() no longer
used, so it is also removed from the 8350 core code.
