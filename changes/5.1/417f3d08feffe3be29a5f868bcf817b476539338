net: marvell: mvpp2: read correct pause bits

When reading the pause bits in mac_link_state, mvpp2 was reporting
the state of the "active pause" bits, which are set when the MAC is
in pause mode.  This is not what phylink wants - we want the
negotiated pause state.  Fix the definition so we read the correct
bits.
