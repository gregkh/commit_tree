net/mlx5: Add host params change event

In Embedded CPU (EC) configurations, the EC driver needs to know when
the number of virtual functions change on the corresponding PF at the
host side. This is required so the EC driver can create or destroy
representor net devices that represent the VFs ports.

Whenever a change in the number of VFs occurs, firmware will generate an
event towards the EC which will trigger a work to complete the rest of
the handling. The specifics of the handling will be introduced in a
downstream patch.
