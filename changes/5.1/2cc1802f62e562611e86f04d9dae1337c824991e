media: vb2: Keep dma-buf buffers mapped until they are freed

When using vb2 for video decoding, dequeued capture buffers may still
be accessed by the hardware: this is the case when they are used as
reference frames for decoding subsequent frames.

When the buffer is imported with dma-buf, it needs to be mapped before
access. Until now, it was mapped when queuing and unmapped when
dequeuing, which doesn't work for access as a reference frames.

One way to solve this would be to map the buffer again when it is
needed as a reference, but the mapping/unmapping operations can
seriously impact performance. As a result, map the buffer once (when it
is first needed when queued) and keep it mapped until it is freed.
