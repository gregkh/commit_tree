drm/i915: Wait for a moment before forcibly resetting the device

During igt, we ask to reset the device if any requests are still
outstanding at the end of a test, as this quickly kills off any
erroneous hanging request streams that may escape a test. However, since
it may take the device a few milliseconds to flush itself after the end
of a normal test, *cough* guc *cough*, we may accidentally tell the
device to reset itself after it idles. If we wait a moment, our usual
I915_IDLE_ENGINES_TIMEOUT of 200ms (seems a bit high, but still better
than umpteen hangchecks!), we can differentiate better between a stuck
engine and a healthy one, and so avoid prematurely forcing the reset and
any extra complications that may entail.
