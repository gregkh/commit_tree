i2c: tegra: update transfer timeout

Tegra194 allows max of 64K bytes and Tegra186 and prior allows
max of 4K bytes of transfer per packet.

one sec timeout is not enough for transfers more than 10K bytes
at STD bus rate.

This patch updates I2C transfer timeout based on the transfer size
and I2C bus rate to allow enough time during max transfer size at
lower bus speed.
