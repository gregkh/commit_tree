powerpc/eeh: Add eeh_force_recover to debugfs

This patch adds a debugfs interface to force scheduling a recovery event.
This can be used to recover a specific PE or schedule a "special" recovery
even that checks for errors at the PHB level.
To force a recovery of a normal PE, use:

 echo '<#pe>:<#phb>' > /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/eeh_force_recover

To force a scan for broken PHBs:

 echo 'hwcheck' > /sys/kernel/debug/powerpc/eeh_force_recover
