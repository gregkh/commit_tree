tracing: Do not free iter->trace in fail path of tracing_open_pipe()

Commit d716ff71dd12 ("tracing: Remove taking of trace_types_lock in
pipe files") use the current tracer instead of the copy in
tracing_open_pipe(), but it forget to remove the freeing sentence in
the error path.

There's an error path that can call kfree(iter->trace) after the iter->trace
was assigned to tr->current_trace, which would be bad to free.
