platform/x86: mlx-platform: Add support for fan capability registers

Provide support for the fan capability registers for the next generation
systems of types MQM87xx, MSN34xx, MSN37xx. These new registers provide
configuration for tachometers and fan drawers connectivity.  Use these
registers for next generation led, fan and hotplug structures in order
to distinguish between the systems which have minor configuration
differences. This reduces the amount of code used to describe such
systems.
