USB: serial: cp210x: add minimum baud rate for CP2105 SCI

Add minimum baud rate to the cp210x driver.

According to the datasheet for CP2105, the SCI supports 2400 as the
lowest baud rate. As this is not heeded in the current code, an error
message 'failed set req 0x1e size 4 status: -32' when trying to set a
lower baud rate such as 300.
The other cp210x models to date supports a minimum baud rate of 300.
