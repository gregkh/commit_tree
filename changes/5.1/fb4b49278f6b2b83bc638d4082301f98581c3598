drm/gem: Mark pinned pages as unevictable

The gem drivers use shmemfs to allocate backing storage for gem objects.
On Samsung Chromebook Plus, the drm/rockchip driver may call
rockchip_gem_get_pages -> drm_gem_get_pages -> shmem_read_mapping_page
to pin a lot of pages, breaking the page reclaim mechanism and causing
oom-killer invocation.

E.g. when the size of a zone is 3.9 GiB, the inactive_ratio is 5. If
active_anon / inactive_anon < 5 and all pages in the inactive_anon lru
are pinned, page reclaim would keep scanning inactive_anon lru without
reclaiming memory. It breaks page reclaim when the rockchip driver only
pins about 1/6 of the anon lru pages.

Mark these pinned pages as unevictable to avoid the premature oom-killer
invocation. See also similar patch on i915 driver [1].
