serial: Add Tegra Combined UART driver

The Tegra Combined UART (TCU) is a mailbox-based mechanism that allows
multiplexing multiple "virtual UARTs" into a single hardware serial
port. The TCU is the primary serial port on Tegra194 devices.

Add a TCU driver utilizing the mailbox framework, as the used mailboxes
are part of Tegra HSP blocks that are already controlled by the Tegra
HSP mailbox driver.
