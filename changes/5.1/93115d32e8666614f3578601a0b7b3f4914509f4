perf report: Display arch specific diagnostic counter sets, starting with s390

On s390 the event bc000 (also named CF_DIAG) extracts the CPU
Measurement Facility diagnostic counter sets and displays them as
counter number and counter value pairs sorted by counter set number.

Output:
 [root@s35lp76 perf]# ./perf report -D --stdio

The number in brackets is the offset into the raw data field of the
sample.

New functions trace_event_sample_raw__init() and s390_sample_raw() are
introduced in the code path to enable interpretation on non s390
platforms. This event bc000 attached raw data is generated only on s390
platform. Correct display on other platforms requires correct endianness
handling.

Committer notes:

Added a init function that sets up a evlist function pointer to avoid
repeated tests on evlist->env and calls to perf_env__name() that
involves normalizing, etc, for each PERF_RECORD_SAMPLE.

Removed needless __maybe_unused from the trace_event_raw()
prototype in session.h, move it to be an static function in evlist.

The 'offset' variable is a size_t, not an u64, fix it to avoid this on
some arches:
