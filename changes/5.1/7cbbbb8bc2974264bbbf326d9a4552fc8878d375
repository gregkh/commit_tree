kbuild: warn redundant generic-y

The generic-y is redundant under the following condition:

 - arch has its own implementation

 - the same header is added to generated-y

 - the same header is added to mandatory-y

If a redundant generic-y is found, the warning like follows is displayed:

  scripts/Makefile.asm-generic:20: redundant generic-y found in arch/arm/include/asm/Kbuild: timex.h

I fixed up arch Kbuild files found by this.
