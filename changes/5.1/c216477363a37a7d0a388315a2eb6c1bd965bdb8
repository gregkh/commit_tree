habanalabs: add debugfs support

This patch adds debugfs support to the driver. It allows the user-space to
display information that is contained in the internal structures of the
driver, such as:
- active command submissions
- active user virtual memory mappings
- number of allocated command buffers

It also enables the user to perform reads and writes through Goya's PCI
bars.
