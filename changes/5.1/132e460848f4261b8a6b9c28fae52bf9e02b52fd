new helper: do_new_mount_fc()

Create an fs_context-aware version of do_new_mount().  This takes an
fs_context with a superblock already attached to it.

Make do_new_mount() use do_new_mount_fc() rather than do_new_mount(); this
allows the consolidation of the mount creation, check and add steps.

To make this work, mount_too_revealing() is changed to take a superblock
rather than a mount (which the fs_context doesn't have available), allowing
this check to be done before the mount object is created.
