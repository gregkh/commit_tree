ARM: milbeaut: fix build with !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU

When HOTPLUG_CPU is disabled, some fields in the smp operations
are not available or needed:

arch/arm/mach-milbeaut/platsmp.c:90:3: error: field designator 'cpu_die' does not refer to any field in type
      'struct smp_operations'
        .cpu_die                = m10v_cpu_die,
         ^
arch/arm/mach-milbeaut/platsmp.c:91:3: error: field designator 'cpu_kill' does not refer to any field in type
      'struct smp_operations'
        .cpu_kill               = m10v_cpu_kill,
         ^

Hide them in an #ifdef like the other platforms do.
