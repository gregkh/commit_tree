pinctrl: qcom: spmi-gpio: Reorder debug print

It's reasonable to expect that people turn to the "gpio" debugfs file to
first and foremost learn about the direction and value of a gpio, and
second to that about it's pinconf. So reorder the value so each line
reads:

gpioN: direction value ...

This also makes it consistent with the TLMM pinctrl driver's output in
the same dump.
