net/mlx5: ethtool, Allow legacy link-modes configuration via non-extended ptys

Allow configuration of legacy link-modes even when extended link-modes
are supported. This requires reading of legacy advertisement even when
extended link-modes are supported. Since legacy and extended
advertisement are mutually excluded, wait for empty reply from extended
advertisement before reading legacy advertisement.
