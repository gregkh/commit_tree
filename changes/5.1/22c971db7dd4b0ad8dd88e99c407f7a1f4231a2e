staging: rtl8712: uninitialized memory in read_bbreg_hdl()

Colin King reported a bug in read_bbreg_hdl():

	memcpy(pcmd->rsp, (u8 *)&val, pcmd->rspsz);

The problem is that "val" is uninitialized.

This code is obviously not useful, but so far as I can tell
"pcmd->cmdcode" is never GEN_CMD_CODE(_Read_BBREG) so it's not harmful
either.  For now the easiest fix is to just call r8712_free_cmd_obj()
and return.
