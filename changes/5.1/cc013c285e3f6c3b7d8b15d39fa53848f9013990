phy: make phy-core explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/phy/Kconfig:config GENERIC_PHY
drivers/phy/Kconfig:    bool "PHY Core"

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the modular code that is essentially orphaned, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_init translates to device_initcall in the non-modular
case, the init ordering remains unchanged with this commit.

We don't remove module.h since the file is using other modular fcns
(to load other phy modules) even though the core support itself is
non-modular.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
