phy: make phy-armada375-usb2 explicitly non-modular

The Kconfig currently controlling compilation of this code is:

drivers/phy/marvell/Kconfig:config ARMADA375_USBCLUSTER_PHY
drivers/phy/marvell/Kconfig:    def_bool y

...meaning that it currently is not being built as a module by anyone.

Lets remove the couple of traces of modular infrastructure, so that
when reading the driver there is no doubt it is builtin-only.

Since module_platform_driver() uses the same init level priority as
builtin_platform_driver() the init ordering remains unchanged with
this commit.

Also note that MODULE_DEVICE_TABLE is a no-op for non-modular code.

We also delete the MODULE_LICENSE tag etc. since all that information
is already contained at the top of the file in the comments.
