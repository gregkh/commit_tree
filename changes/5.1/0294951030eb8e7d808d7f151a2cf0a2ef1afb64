PCI/VMD: Configure MPS settings before adding devices

In order to provide the most performance and/or compatible settings,
ensure VMD root buses observe the pcie bus tuning settings by
configuring those settings prior to adding the devices to the pcie tree.

This patch open-codes pci_rescan_bus() and configures the buses prior to
adding devices and attaching drivers.
