pinctrl: qcom: spmi-gpio: hardcode IRQ counts

The probing of this driver calls platform_irq_count, which will
setup all of the IRQs that are configured in device tree. In
preparation for converting this driver to be a hierarchical IRQ
chip, hardcode the IRQ count based on the hardware type so that all
the IRQs are not configured immediately and are configured on an
as-needed basis later in the boot process. This change will also
allow for the removal of the interrupts property later in this
patch series once the hierarchical IRQ chip support is in.

This patch also removes the generic qcom,spmi-gpio OF match since we
don't know the number of pins. All of the existing upstream bindings
already include the more-specific binding.

The pm8941 code was tested on a LG Nexus 5 (hammerhead) phone.
