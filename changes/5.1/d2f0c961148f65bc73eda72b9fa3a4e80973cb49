ipv4: ip_do_fragment: Preserve skb_iif during fragmentation

Previously, during fragmentation after forwarding, skb->skb_iif isn't
preserved, i.e. 'ip_copy_metadata' does not copy skb_iif from given
'from' skb.

As a result, ip_do_fragment's creates fragments with zero skb_iif,
leading to inconsistent behavior.

Assume for example an eBPF program attached at tc egress (post
forwarding) that examines __sk_buff->ingress_ifindex:
 - the correct iif is observed if forwarding path does not involve
   fragmentation/refragmentation
 - a bogus iif is observed if forwarding path involves
   fragmentation/refragmentatiom

Fix, by preserving skb_iif during 'ip_copy_metadata'.
