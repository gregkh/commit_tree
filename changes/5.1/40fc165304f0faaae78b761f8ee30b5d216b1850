usb: host: xhci-rcar: Add XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk

When plugging BUFFALO LUA4-U3-AGT USB3.0 to Gigabit Ethernet LAN
Adapter, warning messages filled up dmesg.

[  101.098287] xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: WARN Successful completion on short TX for slot 1 ep 4: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?
[  101.117463] xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: WARN Successful completion on short TX for slot 1 ep 4: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?
[  101.136513] xhci-hcd ee000000.usb: WARN Successful completion on short TX for slot 1 ep 4: needs XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk?

Adding the XHCI_TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk resolves the issue.
