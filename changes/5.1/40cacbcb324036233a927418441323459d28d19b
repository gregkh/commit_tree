mm, compaction: remove unnecessary zone parameter in some instances

A zone parameter is passed into a number of top-level compaction
functions despite the fact that it's already in compact_control.  This
is harmless but it did need an audit to check if zone actually ever
changes meaningfully.  This patches removes the parameter in a number of
top-level functions.  The change could be much deeper but this was
enough to briefly clarify the flow.

No functional change.
