ext4: don't update s_rev_level if not required

Don't update the superblock s_rev_level during mount if it isn't
actually necessary, only if superblock features are being set by
the kernel.  This was originally added for ext3 since it always
set the INCOMPAT_RECOVER and HAS_JOURNAL features during mount,
but this is not needed since no journal mode was added to ext4.

That will allow Geert to mount his 20-year-old ext2 rev 0.0 m68k
filesystem, as a testament of the backward compatibility of ext4.
