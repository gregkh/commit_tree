nfit/ars: Allow root to busy-poll the ARS state machine

The ARS implementation implements exponential back-off on the poll
interval to prevent high-frequency access to the DIMM / platform
interface. Depending on when the ARS completes the poll interval may
exceed the completion event by minutes. Allow root to reset the timeout
each time it probes the status. A one-second timeout is still enforced,
but root can otherwise can control the poll interval.
