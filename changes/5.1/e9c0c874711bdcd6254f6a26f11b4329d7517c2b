drm/dp: annotate implicit fall throughs

There is a plan to build the kernel with -Wimplicit-fallthrough and
these places in the code produced warnings (W=1). Fix them up.

This commit remove the following warnings:

  include/linux/compiler.h:77:22: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
  include/asm-generic/bug.h:134:2: note: in expansion of macro 'unlikely'
  drivers/gpu/drm/drm_dp_helper.c:155:3: note: in expansion of macro 'WARN'
  include/linux/compiler.h:77:22: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
