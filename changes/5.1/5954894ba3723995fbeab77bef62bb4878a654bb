net_sched: add performance counters for basic filter

Similar to u32 filter, it is useful to know how many times
we reach each basic filter and how many times we pass the
ematch attached to it.

Sample output:

filter protocol arp pref 49152 basic chain 0
filter protocol arp pref 49152 basic chain 0 handle 0x1  (rule hit 3 success 3)
	action order 1: gact action pass
	 random type none pass val 0
	 index 1 ref 1 bind 1 installed 81 sec used 4 sec
	Action statistics:
	Sent 126 bytes 3 pkt (dropped 0, overlimits 0 requeues 0)
	backlog 0b 0p requeues 0
