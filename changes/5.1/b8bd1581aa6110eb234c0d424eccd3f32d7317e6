cpufreq: intel_pstate: Rework iowait boosting to be less aggressive

The current iowait boosting mechanism in intel_pstate_update_util()
is quite aggressive, as it goes to the maximum P-state right away,
and may cause excessive amounts of energy to be used, which is not
desirable and arguably isn't necessary too.

Follow commit a5a0809bc58e ("cpufreq: schedutil: Make iowait boost
more energy efficient") that reworked the analogous iowait boost
mechanism in the schedutil governor and make the iowait boosting
in intel_pstate_update_util() work along the same lines.
