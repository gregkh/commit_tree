scsi: target/core: Inline transport_lun_remove_cmd()

Remove the code that clears .se_lun from transport_cmd_check_stop_to_fabric()
such that the transport_lun_remove_cmd() call can be moved into
target_release_cmd_kref(). Because this guarantees that
transport_lun_remove_cmd() will be called exactly once, it is safe to change
the cmpxchg() call into a test of se_cmd.lun_ref_active. Inline
transport_lun_remove_cmd() because it is not worth to keep it as a separate
function.
