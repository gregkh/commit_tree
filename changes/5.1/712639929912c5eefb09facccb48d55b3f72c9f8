sch_cake: Make the dual modes fairer

CAKE host fairness does not work well with TCP flows in dual-srchost and
dual-dsthost setup. The reason is that ACKs generated by TCP flows are
classified as sparse flows, and affect flow isolation from other hosts. Fix
this by calculating host_load based only on the bulk flows a host
generates. In a hash collision the host_bulk_flow_count values must be
decremented on the old hosts and incremented on the new ones *if* the queue
is in the bulk set.
