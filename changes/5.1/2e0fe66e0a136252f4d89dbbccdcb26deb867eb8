media: imx: csi: Disable CSI immediately after last EOF

Disable the CSI immediately after receiving the last EOF before stream
off (and thus before disabling the IDMA channel). Do this by moving the
wait for EOF completion into a new function csi_idmac_wait_last_eof().

This fixes a complete system hard lockup on the SabreAuto when streaming
from the ADV7180, by repeatedly sending a stream off immediately followed
by stream on:

while true; do v4l2-ctl  -d4 --stream-mmap --stream-count=3; done

Eventually this either causes the system lockup or EOF timeouts at all
subsequent stream on, until a system reset.

The lockup occurs when disabling the IDMA channel at stream off. Disabling
the CSI before disabling the IDMA channel appears to be a reliable fix for
the hard lockup.
