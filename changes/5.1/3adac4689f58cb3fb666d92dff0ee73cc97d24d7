drm/i915: Introduce concept of per-timeline (context) HWSP

Supplement the per-engine HWSP with a per-timeline HWSP. That is a
per-request pointer through which we can check a local seqno,
abstracting away the presumption of a global seqno. In this first step,
we point each request back into the engine's HWSP so everything
continues to work with the global timeline.

v2: s/i915_request_hwsp/hwsp_seqno/ to emphasis that this is the current
HW value and that we are accessing it via i915_request merely as a
convenience.
