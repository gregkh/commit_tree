audit: mark expected switch fall-through

In preparation to enabling -Wimplicit-fallthrough, mark switch
cases where we are expecting to fall through.

This patch fixes the following warning:

kernel/auditfilter.c: In function ‘audit_krule_to_data’:
kernel/auditfilter.c:668:7: warning: this statement may fall through [-Wimplicit-fallthrough=]
    if (krule->pflags & AUDIT_LOGINUID_LEGACY && !f->val) {
       ^
kernel/auditfilter.c:674:3: note: here
   default:
   ^~~~~~~

Warning level 3 was used: -Wimplicit-fallthrough=3

Notice that, in this particular case, the code comment is modified
in accordance with what GCC is expecting to find.

This patch is part of the ongoing efforts to enable
-Wimplicit-fallthrough.
