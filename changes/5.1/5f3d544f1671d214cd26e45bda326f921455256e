audit: remove audit_context when CONFIG_ AUDIT and not AUDITSYSCALL

Remove audit_context from struct task_struct and struct audit_buffer
when CONFIG_AUDIT is enabled but CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL is not.

Also, audit_log_name() (and supporting inode and fcaps functions) should
have been put back in auditsc.c when soft and hard link logging was
normalized since it is only used by syscall auditing.
