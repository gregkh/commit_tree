virt_wifi: Remove REGULATORY_WIPHY_SELF_MANAGED

REGULATORY_WIPHY_SELF_MANAGED as set here breaks NL80211_CMD_GET_REG,
because it expects the wiphy to do regulatory management. Since
virt_wifi does not do regulatory management, this triggers a WARN_ON in
NL80211_CMD_GET_REG and fails the netlink command.

Removing REGULATORY_WIPHY_SELF_MANAGED fixes the problem and the virtual
wireless network continues to work.
