Revert "KVM: MMU: drop kvm_mmu_zap_mmio_sptes"

Revert back to a dedicated (and slower) mechanism for handling the
scenario where all MMIO shadow PTEs need to be zapped due to overflowing
the MMIO generation number.  The MMIO generation scenario is almost
literally a one-in-a-million occurrence, i.e. is not a performance
sensitive scenario.

Restoring kvm_mmu_zap_mmio_sptes() leaves VM teardown as the only user
of kvm_mmu_invalidate_zap_all_pages() and paves the way for removing
the fast invalidate mechanism altogether.

This reverts commit a8eca9dcc656a405a28ffba43f3d86a1ff0eb331.
