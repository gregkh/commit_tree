KVM: arm/arm64: Simplify bg_timer programming

Instead of calling into kvm_timer_[un]schedule from the main kvm
blocking path, test if the VCPU is on the wait queue from the load/put
path and perform the background timer setup/cancel in this path.

This has the distinct advantage that we no longer race between load/put
and schedule/unschedule and programming and canceling of the bg_timer
always happens when the timer state is not loaded.

Note that we must now remove the checks in kvm_timer_blocking that do
not schedule a background timer if one of the timers can fire, because
we no longer have a guarantee that kvm_vcpu_check_block() will be called
before kvm_timer_blocking.
