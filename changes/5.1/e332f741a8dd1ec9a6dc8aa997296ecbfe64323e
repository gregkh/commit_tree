mm, compaction: be selective about what pageblocks to clear skip hints

Pageblock hints are cleared when compaction restarts or kswapd makes
enough progress that it can sleep but it's over-eager in that the bit is
cleared for migration sources with no LRU pages and migration targets
with no free pages.  As pageblock skip hint flushes are relatively rare
and out-of-band with respect to kswapd, this patch makes a few more
expensive checks to see if it's appropriate to even clear the bit.
Every pageblock that is not cleared will avoid 512 pages being scanned
unnecessarily on x86-64.

The impact is variable with different workloads showing small
differences in latency, success rates and scan rates.  This is expected
as clearing the hints is not that common but doing a small amount of
work out-of-band to avoid a large amount of work in-band later is
generally a good thing.
