powerpc/pseries/energy: Use OF accessor functions to read ibm,drc-indexes

In cpu_to_drc_index() in the case when FW_FEATURE_DRC_INFO is absent,
we currently use of_read_property() to obtain the pointer to the array
corresponding to the property "ibm,drc-indexes". The elements of this
array are of type __be32, but are accessed without any conversion to
the OS-endianness, which is buggy on a Little Endian OS.

Fix this by using of_property_read_u32_index() accessor function to
safely read the elements of the array.
