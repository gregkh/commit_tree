Bluetooth: mediatek: update the common setup between MT7622 and other devices

Update the setup sequence on MT7622 to apply the same flow with MT7663U
and MT7668U USB [1] as much as possible. These additional commands are
required to parse the corresponding event to determine what current state
the Bluetooth device is on and thus it's necessary to extend
mtk_hci_wmt_sync to support the reading status in the same patch.
