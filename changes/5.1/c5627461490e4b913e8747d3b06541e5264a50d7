drm/i915: Disable -Wuninitialized

This warning is disabled by default in scripts/Makefile.extrawarn when
W= is not provided but this Makefile adds -Wall after this warning is
disabled so it shows up in the build when it shouldn't:

In file included from drivers/gpu/drm/i915/intel_breadcrumbs.c:895:
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/selftests/intel_breadcrumbs.c:350:34: error:
variable 'wq' is uninitialized when used within its own initialization
[-Werror,-Wuninitialized]
        DECLARE_WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD_ONSTACK(wq);
                                        ^~
./include/linux/wait.h:74:63: note: expanded from macro

        struct wait_queue_head name = __WAIT_QUEUE_HEAD_INIT_ONSTACK(name)
                               ~~~~                                  ^~~~

        ({ init_waitqueue_head(&name); name; })
                                       ^~~~
1 error generated.

Explicitly disable the warning like commit 46e2068081e9 ("drm/i915:
Disable some extra clang warnings").
