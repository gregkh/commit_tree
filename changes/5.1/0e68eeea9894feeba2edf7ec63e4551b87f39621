platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Fix PCH IP sts reading

A previous commit "platform/x86: intel_pmc_core: Make the driver PCH
family agnostic <c977b98bbef5898ed3d30b08ea67622e9e82082a>" provided
better abstraction to this driver but has some fundamental issues.

e.g. the following condition

for (index = 0; index < pmcdev->map->ppfear_buckets &&
	index < PPFEAR_MAX_NUM_ENTRIES; index++, iter++)

is wrong because for CNL, PPFEAR_MAX_NUM_ENTRIES is hardcoded as 5 which
is _wrong_ and even though ppfear_buckets is 8, the loop fails to read
all eight registers needed for CNL PCH i.e. PPFEAR0 and PPFEAR1. This
patch refactors the pfear show logic to correctly read PCH IP power
gating status for Cannonlake and beyond.
