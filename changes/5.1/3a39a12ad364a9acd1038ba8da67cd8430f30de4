net: hns: fix KASAN: use-after-free in hns_nic_net_xmit_hw()

This patch is trying to fix the issue due to:
[27237.844750] BUG: KASAN: use-after-free in hns_nic_net_xmit_hw+0x708/0xa18[hns_enet_drv]

After hnae_queue_xmit() in hns_nic_net_xmit_hw(), can be
interrupted by interruptions, and than call hns_nic_tx_poll_one()
to handle the new packets, and free the skb. So, when turn back to
hns_nic_net_xmit_hw(), calling skb->len will cause use-after-free.

This patch update tx ring statistics in hns_nic_tx_poll_one() to
fix the bug.
