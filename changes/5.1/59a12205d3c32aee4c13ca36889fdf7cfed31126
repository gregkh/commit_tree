lkdtm: Add tests for NULL pointer dereference

Introduce lkdtm tests for NULL pointer dereference: check access or exec
at NULL address, since these errors tend to be reported differently from
the general fault error text. For example from x86:

    pr_alert("BUG: unable to handle kernel %s at %px\n",
        address < PAGE_SIZE ? "NULL pointer dereference" : "paging request",
        (void *)address);
