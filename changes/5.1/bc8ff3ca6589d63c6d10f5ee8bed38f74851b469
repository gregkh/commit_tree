docs/core-api/mm: fix user memory accessors formatting

The descriptions of userspace memory access functions had minor issues
with formatting that made kernel-doc unable to properly detect the
function/macro names and the return value sections:

./arch/x86/include/asm/uaccess.h:80: info: Scanning doc for

./arch/x86/lib/usercopy_32.c:90: warning: No description found for return

Fix the formatting.
