ASoC: rt274: Variable "buf" in function rt274_jack_detect() could be uninitialized

In function rt274_jack_detect(), local variable "buf" could
be uninitialized if function regmap_read() returns -EINVAL.
However, it will be used to calculate "hp" and "mic" and
make their value unpredictable while those value are used
in the caller. This is potentially unsafe.
