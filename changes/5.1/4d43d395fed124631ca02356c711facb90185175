workqueue: Try to catch flush_work() without INIT_WORK().

syzbot found a flush_work() caller who forgot to call INIT_WORK()
because that work_struct was allocated by kzalloc() [1]. But the message

  INFO: trying to register non-static key.
  the code is fine but needs lockdep annotation.
  turning off the locking correctness validator.

by lock_map_acquire() is failing to tell that INIT_WORK() is missing.

Since flush_work() without INIT_WORK() is a bug, and INIT_WORK() should
set ->func field to non-zero, let's warn if ->func field is zero.
