drm/msm: Truncate the buffer object name if the copy from user failed

(Resend since there was a compile error that I forgot to commit before sending)

If there is a error while doing a copy_from_user() for MSM_INFO_SET_NAME
make sure to truncate the object name so that there isn't a chance that
we'll have random data in the string.
