ext2: Fix underflow in ext2_max_size()

When ext2 filesystem is created with 64k block size, ext2_max_size()
will return value less than 0. Also, we cannot write any file in this fs
since the sb->maxbytes is less than 0. The core of the problem is that
the size of block index tree for such large block size is more than
i_blocks can carry. So fix the computation to count with this
possibility.

File size limits computed with the new function for the full range of
possible block sizes look like:

bits file_size
10     17247252480
11    275415851008
12   2196873666560
13   2197948973056
14   2198486220800
15   2198754754560
16   2198888906752
