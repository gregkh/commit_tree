ipc: Convert mqueue fs to fs_context

Convert the mqueue filesystem to use the filesystem context stuff.

Notes:

 (1) The relevant ipc namespace is selected in when the context is
     initialised (and it defaults to the current task's ipc namespace).
     The caller can override this before calling vfs_get_tree().

 (2) Rather than simply calling kern_mount_data(), mq_init_ns() and
     mq_internal_mount() create a context, adjust it and then do the rest
     of the mount procedure.

 (3) The lazy mqueue mounting on creation of a new namespace is retained
     from a previous patch, but the avoidance of sget() if no superblock
     yet exists is reverted and the superblock is again keyed on the
     namespace pointer.

     Yes, there was a performance gain in not searching the superblock
     hash, but it's only paid once per ipc namespace - and only if someone
     uses mqueue within that namespace, so I'm not sure it's worth it,
     especially as calling sget() allows avoidance of recursion.
