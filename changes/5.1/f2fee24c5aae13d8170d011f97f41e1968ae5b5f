ACPICA: Get rid of acpi_sleep_dispatch()

No need for the array of structs of function pointers when we can just
call the handfull of functions directly.

This could be further cleaned up if acpi_gbl_reduced_hardware was defined
true in the ACPI_REDUCED_HARDWARE case, but that's material for the next
round.
