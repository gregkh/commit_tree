ALSA: firewire-motu: use 'version' field of unit directory to identify model

Current ALSA firewire-motu driver uses the value of 'model' field
of unit directory in configuration ROM for modalias for MOTU
FireWire models. However, as long as I checked, Pre8 and
828mk3(Hybrid) have the same value for the field (=0x100800).

unit            | version   | model
--------------- | --------- | ----------
828mkII         | 0x000003  | 0x101800
Traveler        | 0x000009  | 0x107800
Pre8            | 0x00000f  | 0x100800 <-
828mk3(FW)      | 0x000015  | 0x106800
AudioExpress    | 0x000033  | 0x104800
828mk3(Hybrid)  | 0x000035  | 0x100800 <-

When updating firmware for MOTU 8pre FireWire from v1.0.0 to v1.0.3,
I got change of the value from 0x100800 to 0x103800. On the other
hand, the value of 'version' field is fixed to 0x00000f. As a quick
glance, the higher 12 bits of the value of 'version' field represent
firmware version, while the lower 12 bits is unknown.

By induction, the value of 'version' field represents actual model.

This commit changes modalias to match the value of 'version' field,
instead of 'model' field. For degug, long name of added sound card
includes hexadecimal value of 'model' field.
