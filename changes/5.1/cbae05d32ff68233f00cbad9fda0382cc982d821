printk: Pass caller information to log_store().

When thread1 called printk() which did not end with '\n', and then thread2
called printk() which ends with '\n' before thread1 calls pr_cont(), the
partial content saved into "struct cont" is flushed by thread2 despite the
partial content was generated by thread1. This leads to confusing output
as if the partial content was generated by thread2. Fix this problem by
passing correct caller information to log_store().

Before:

  [ T8533] abcdefghijklm
  [ T8533] ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  [ T8532] nopqrstuvwxyz
  [ T8532] abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  [ T8533] abcdefghijklm
  [ T8533] ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  [ T8532] nopqrstuvwxyz

After:

  [ T8507] abcdefghijklm
  [ T8508] ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  [ T8507] nopqrstuvwxyz
  [ T8507] abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  [ T8507] abcdefghijklm
  [ T8508] ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
  [ T8507] nopqrstuvwxyz
