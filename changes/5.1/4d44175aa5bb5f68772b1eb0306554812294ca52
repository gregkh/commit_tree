netfilter: nf_tables: handle nft_object lookups via rhltable

Instead of linear search, use rhlist interface to look up the objects.
This fixes rulesets with thousands of named objects (quota, counters and
the like).

We only use a single table for this and consider the address of the
table we're doing the lookup in as a part of the key.

This reduces restore time of a sample ruleset with ~20k named counters
from 37 seconds to 0.8 seconds.
