sched/topology: Fix percpu data types in struct sd_data & struct s_data

The percpu members of struct sd_data and s_data are declared as:

	struct ... ** __percpu member;

So their type is:

	__percpu pointer to pointer to struct ...

But looking at how they're used, their type should be:

	pointer to __percpu pointer to struct ...

and they should thus be declared as:

	struct ... * __percpu *member;

So fix the placement of '__percpu' in the definition of these
structures.

This addresses a bunch of Sparse's warnings like:

	warning: incorrect type in initializer (different address spaces)
	  expected void const [noderef] <asn:3> *__vpp_verify
	  got struct sched_domain **
