lantiq_etop: pass struct device to DMA API functions

The DMA API generally relies on a struct device to work properly, and
only barely works without one for legacy reasons.  Pass the easily
available struct device from the platform_device to remedy this.

Note this driver seems to lack dma_unmap_* calls entirely, but fixing
that is left for another time.
