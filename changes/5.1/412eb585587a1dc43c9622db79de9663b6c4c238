tpm: use tpm_buf in tpm_transmit_cmd() as the IO parameter

Since we pass an initialized struct tpm_buf instance in every call site
now, it is cleaner to pass that directly to the tpm_transmit_cmd() as
the TPM command/response buffer.

Fine-tune a little bit tpm_transmit() and tpm_transmit_cmd() comments
while doing this.
