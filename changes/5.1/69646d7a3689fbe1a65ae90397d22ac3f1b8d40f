tty/serial: atmel: RS485 HD w/DMA: enable RX after TX is stopped

In half-duplex operation, RX should be started after TX completes.

If DMA is used, there is a case when the DMA transfer completes but the
TX FIFO is not emptied, so the RX cannot be restarted just yet.

Use a boolean variable to store this state and rearm TX interrupt mask
to be signaled again that the transfer finished. In interrupt transmit
handler this variable is used to start RX. A warning message is generated
if RX is activated before TX fifo is cleared.

RX after TX is done")
