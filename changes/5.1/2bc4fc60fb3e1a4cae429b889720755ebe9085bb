kernel/sysctl.c: define minmax conv functions in terms of non-minmax versions

do_proc_do[u]intvec_minmax_conv() had included open-coded versions of
do_proc_do[u]intvec_conv(); the duplication led to buggy inconsistencies
(missing range checks).  To reduce the likelihood of such problems in the
future, we can instead refactor both to be defined in terms of their
non-bounded counterparts (plus the added check).
