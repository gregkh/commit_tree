tcp: change pingpong threshold to 3

In order to be more confident about an on-going interactive session, we
increment pingpong count by 1 for every interactive transaction and we
adjust TCP_PINGPONG_THRESH to 3.
This means, we only consider a session in pingpong mode after we see 3
interactive transactions, and start to activate delayed acks in quick
ack mode.
And in order to not over-count the credits, we only increase pingpong
count for the first packet sent in response for the previous received
packet.
This is mainly to prevent delaying the ack immediately after some
handshake protocol but no real interactive traffic pattern afterwards.
