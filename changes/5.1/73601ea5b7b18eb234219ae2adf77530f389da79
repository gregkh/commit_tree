fs/open.c: allow opening only regular files during execve()

syzbot is hitting lockdep warning [1] due to trying to open a fifo
during an execve() operation.  But we don't need to open non regular
files during an execve() operation, for all files which we will need are
the executable file itself and the interpreter programs like /bin/sh and
ld-linux.so.2 .

Since the manpage for execve(2) says that execve() returns EACCES when
the file or a script interpreter is not a regular file, and the manpage
for uselib(2) says that uselib() can return EACCES, and we use
FMODE_EXEC when opening for execve()/uselib(), we can bail out if a non
regular file is requested with FMODE_EXEC set.

Since this deadlock followed by khungtaskd warnings is trivially
reproducible by a local unprivileged user, and syzbot's frequent crash
due to this deadlock defers finding other bugs, let's workaround this
deadlock until we get a chance to find a better solution.
