ath10k: add a condition to fill the LDPC capability correctly

The firmware advertises the LDPC support information for HT in
HT capability info in the wmi service ready event. To provide
granularity, firmware now advertises WMI_HT_CAP_RX_LDPC and
WMI_HT_CAP_TX_LDPC separately. To support LDPC, host should
also check for WMI_HT_CAP_RX_LDPC and WMI_HT_CAP_TX_LDPC in HT
capabilities.

Add a condition to existing logic in host to know whether firmware
supports LDPC or not.
