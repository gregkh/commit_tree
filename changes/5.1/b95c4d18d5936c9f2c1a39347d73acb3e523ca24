<linux/kernel.h>: drop the gcc-3.3 'const' hack in roundup()

The single quotation marks around "const" were causing a documentation
markup warning with reST.  Instead of fixing that warning, just delete
that comment line and the gcc-3.3 hack of using "const" in the roundup()
macro since gcc-3.3 is no longer supported for kernel builds.

I did around 20 different $arch builds with no problems, but we'll just
have to see if this causes problems for anyone else out there.
