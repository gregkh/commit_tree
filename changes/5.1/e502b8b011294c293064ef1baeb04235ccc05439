RDMA/core: Don't depend device ODP capabilities on kconfig option

Device capability bits are exposing what specific device supports from HW
perspective. Those bits are not dependent on kernel configurations and
RDMA/core should ensure that proper interfaces to users will be disabled
if CONFIG_INFINIBAND_ON_DEMAND_PAGING is not set.
