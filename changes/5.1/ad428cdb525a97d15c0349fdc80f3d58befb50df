dax: Check the end of the block-device capacity with dax_direct_access()

The checks in __bdev_dax_supported() helped mitigate a potential data
corruption bug in the pmem driver's handling of section alignment
padding. Strengthen the checks, including checking the end of the range,
to validate the dev_pagemap, Xarray entries, and sector-to-pfn
translation established for pmem namespaces.
