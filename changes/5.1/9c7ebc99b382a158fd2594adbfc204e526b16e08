usb: dwc3: haps: Workaround matching VID PID

i.MX6QP and i.MX7D platform use a PCIe controller with the same VID and
PID as this USB controller. The system may incorrectly match this driver
to that PCIe controller. To workaround this, specifically use class type
USB with PCI device ID to prevent incorrect driver matching.
