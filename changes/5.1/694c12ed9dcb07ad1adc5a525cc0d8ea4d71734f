btrfs: Rename found_type to extent_type in btrfs_get_extent

found_type really holds the type of extent and is guaranteed to to have
a value between [0, 2]. The only time it can contain anything different
is if btrfs_lookup_file_extent returned a positive value and the
previous item is different than an extent. Avoid this situation by
simply checking found_key.type rather than assigning the item type to
found_type intermittently. Also make the variable an u8 to reduce stack
usage. No functional changes.
