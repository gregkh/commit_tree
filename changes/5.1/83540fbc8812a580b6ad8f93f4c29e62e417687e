tracing/perf: Use strndup_user() instead of buggy open-coded version

The first version of this method was missing the check for
`ret == PATH_MAX`; then such a check was added, but it didn't call kfree()
on error, so there was still a small memory leak in the error case.
Fix it by using strndup_user() instead of open-coding it.
