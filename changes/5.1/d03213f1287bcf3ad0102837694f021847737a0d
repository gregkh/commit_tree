HID: sony: Fix SHANWAN PS3 GamePad rumble and led settings support

Rumble support on SHANWAN PS3 gamepad is not working when a user
program has asked it to. If a HID Output Reports is sent via Control
Channel then it will be discard by gamepad, thus rumble motor and led
settings in Output Report are ignored.

This patch therefore sends HID Output Report via Interrupt Channel to
SHANWAN gamepad instead of Control Channel, fixing rumble motor and
led settings.
