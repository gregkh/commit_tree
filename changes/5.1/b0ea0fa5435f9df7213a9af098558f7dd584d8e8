IB/{core,hw}: Have ib_umem_get extract the ib_ucontext from ib_udata

ib_umem_get() can only be called in a method callback, which always has a
udata parameter. This allows ib_umem_get() to derive the ucontext pointer
directly from the udata without requiring the drivers to find it in some
way or another.
