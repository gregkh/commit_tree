RDMA/restrack: Prepare restrack_root to addition of extra fields per-type

As a preparation to extension of rdma_restrack_root to provide software
IDs, which will be per-type too. We convert the rdma_restrack_root from
struct with arrays to array of structs.

Such conversion allows us to drop rwsem lock in favour of internal XArray
lock.
