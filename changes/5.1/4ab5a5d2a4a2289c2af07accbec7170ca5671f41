tools: add a kernel-chktaint to tools/debugging

Add a script to the tools/ directory that shows if or why the running
kernel was tainted. The script was mostly written by Randy Dunlap; I
enhanced the script a bit.  There does not appear to be a good home for
this script. so create tools/debugging for tools of this nature.
