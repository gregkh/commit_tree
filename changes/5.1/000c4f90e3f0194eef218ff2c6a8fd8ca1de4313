drm/i915: Sanity check mmap length against object size

We assumed that vm_mmap() would reject an attempt to mmap past the end of
the filp (our object), but we were wrong.

Applications that tried to use the mmap beyond the end of the object
would be greeted by a SIGBUS. After this patch, those applications will
be told about the error on creating the mmap, rather than at a random
moment on later access.
