usb: gadget: net2272: Fix net2272_dequeue()

Restore the status of ep->stopped in function net2272_dequeue().

When the given request is not found in the endpoint queue
the function returns -EINVAL without restoring the state of
ep->stopped. Thus the endpoint keeps blocked and does not transfer
any data anymore.

This fix is only compile-tested, since we do not have a
corresponding hardware. An analogous fix was tested in the sibling
driver. See "usb: gadget: net2280: Fix net2280_dequeue()"
