nfp: nsp: set higher timeout for flash bundle

The management firmware now supports being passed a bundle with
multiple components to be stored in flash at once. This makes it
easier to update all components to a known state with a single
user command, however, this also has the potential to increase
the time required to perform the update significantly.

The management firmware only updates the components out of a bundle
which are outdated, however, we need to make sure we can handle
the absolute worst case where a CPLD update can take a long time
to perform.

We set a very conservative total timeout of 900s which already
adds a contingency.
