dt-bindings: iio: adc: meson-saradc: update temperature sensor support

Meson8b and Meson8m2 use a 5-bit wide TSC (temperature sensor
coefficient). The SAR ADC registers however can only store (the lower)
4 bits. The fifth (upper-most) bit is stored inside the
MESON_HHI_DPLL_TOP_0[9] register from the HHI register area.
This adds a syscon property to the HHI register area so a driver can
fetch the HHI register map and store the fifth TSC bit in there.
