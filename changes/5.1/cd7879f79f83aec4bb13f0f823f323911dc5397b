drm/i915/gvt: Roundup fb->height into tile's height at calucation fb->size

When fb is tiled and fb->height isn't the multiple of tile's height,
the format fb->size = fb->stride * fb->height, will get a smaller size
than the actual size. As the memory height of tiled fb should be multiple
of tile's height.
