net: stmmac: fix dropping of multi-descriptor RX frames

Packets without the last descriptor set should be dropped early. If we
receive a frame larger than the DMA buffer, the HW will continue using the
next descriptor. Driver mistakes these as individual frames, and sometimes
a truncated frame (without the LD set) may look like a valid packet.

This fixes a strange issue where the system replies to 4098-byte ping
although the MTU/DMA buffer size is set to 4096, and yet at the same
time it's logging an oversized packet.
