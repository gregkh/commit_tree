parisc: Improve initial IRQ to CPU assignment

On parisc, each IRQ can only be handled by one CPU, and currently CPU0
is choosen as default for handling all IRQs by default.
With this patch we now assign each requested IRQ to one of the online
CPUs (and thus distribute the IRQs across all CPUs), even without an
instance of irqbalance running.
