ACPI / APEI: Let the notification helper specify the fixmap slot

ghes_copy_tofrom_phys() uses a different fixmap slot depending on in_nmi().
This doesn't work when there are multiple NMI-like notifications, that
could interrupt each other.

As with the locking, move the chosen fixmap_idx to the notification helper.
This only matters for NMI-like notifications, anything calling
ghes_proc() can use the IRQ fixmap slot as its already holding an irqsave
spinlock.

This lets us collapse the ghes_ioremap_pfn_*() helpers.
