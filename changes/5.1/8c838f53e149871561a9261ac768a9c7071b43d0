dpaa2-eth: fix race condition with bql frame accounting

It might happen that Tx conf acknowledges a frame before it was
subscribed in bql, as subscribing was previously done after the enqueue
operation.

This patch moves the netdev_tx_sent_queue call before the actual frame
enqueue, so that this can never happen.
