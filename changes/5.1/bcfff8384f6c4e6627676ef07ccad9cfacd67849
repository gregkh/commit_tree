tpm: dynamically allocate the allocated_banks array

This patch renames active_banks (member of tpm_chip) to allocated_banks,
stores the number of allocated PCR banks in nr_allocated_banks (new member
of tpm_chip), and replaces the static array with a pointer to a dynamically
allocated array.

tpm2_get_pcr_allocation() determines if a PCR bank is allocated by checking
the mask in the TPML_PCR_SELECTION structure returned by the TPM for
TPM2_Get_Capability(). If a bank is not allocated, the TPM returns that
bank in TPML_PCR_SELECTION, with all bits in the mask set to zero. In this
case, the bank is not included in chip->allocated_banks, to avoid that TPM
driver users unnecessarily calculate a digest for that bank.

One PCR bank with algorithm set to SHA1 is always allocated for TPM 1.x.

As a consequence of the introduction of nr_allocated_banks,
tpm_pcr_extend() does not check anymore if the algorithm stored in tpm_chip
is equal to zero.
