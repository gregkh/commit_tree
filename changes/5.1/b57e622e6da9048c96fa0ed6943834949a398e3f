mm/hmm: convert to use vm_fault_t

Convert to use vm_fault_t type as return type for fault handler.

kbuild reported warning during testing of
*mm-create-the-new-vm_fault_t-type.patch* available in below link -
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10752741/

  kernel/memremap.c:46:34: warning: incorrect type in return expression
                           (different base types)
  kernel/memremap.c:46:34: expected restricted vm_fault_t
  kernel/memremap.c:46:34: got int

This patch has fixed the warnings and also hmm_devmem_fault() is
converted to return vm_fault_t to avoid further warnings.
