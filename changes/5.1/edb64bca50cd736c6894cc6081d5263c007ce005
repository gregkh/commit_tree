ARC: u-boot args: check that magic number is correct

In case of devboards we really often disable bootloader and load
Linux image in memory via JTAG. Even if kernel tries to verify
uboot_tag and uboot_arg there is sill a chance that we treat some
garbage in registers as valid u-boot arguments in JTAG case.
E.g. it is enough to have '1' in r0 to treat any value in r2 as
a boot command line.

So check that magic number passed from u-boot is correct and drop
u-boot arguments otherwise. That helps to reduce the possibility
of using garbage as u-boot arguments in JTAG case.

We can safely check U-boot magic value (0x0) in linux passed via
r1 register as U-boot pass it from the beginning. So there is no
backward-compatibility issues.
