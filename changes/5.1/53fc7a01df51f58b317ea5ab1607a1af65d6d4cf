audit: give a clue what CONFIG_CHANGE op was involved

The failure to add an audit rule due to audit locked gives no clue
what CONFIG_CHANGE operation failed.
Similarly the set operation is the only other operation that doesn't
give the "op=" field to indicate the action.
All other CONFIG_CHANGE records include an op= field to give a clue as
to what sort of configuration change is being executed.

Since these are the only CONFIG_CHANGE records that that do not have an
op= field, add them to bring them in line with the rest.

Old records:
type=CONFIG_CHANGE msg=audit(1519812997.781:374): pid=610 uid=0 auid=0 ses=1 subj=... audit_enabled=2 res=0
type=CONFIG_CHANGE msg=audit(2018-06-14 14:55:04.507:47) : audit_enabled=1 old=1 auid=unset ses=unset subj=... res=yes

New records:
type=CONFIG_CHANGE msg=audit(1520958477.855:100): pid=610 uid=0 auid=0 ses=1 subj=... op=add_rule audit_enabled=2 res=0

type=CONFIG_CHANGE msg=audit(2018-06-14 14:55:04.507:47) : op=set audit_enabled=1 old=1 auid=unset ses=unset subj=... res=yes
