audit: ignore fcaps on umount

Don't fetch fcaps when umount2 is called to avoid a process hang while
it waits for the missing resource to (possibly never) re-appear.

Note the comment above user_path_mountpoint_at():
 * A umount is a special case for path walking. We're not actually interested
 * in the inode in this situation, and ESTALE errors can be a problem.  We
 * simply want track down the dentry and vfsmount attached at the mountpoint
 * and avoid revalidating the last component.

This can happen on ceph, cifs, 9p, lustre, fuse (gluster) or NFS.
