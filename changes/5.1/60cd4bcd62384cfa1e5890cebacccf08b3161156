memcg: localize memcg_kmem_enabled() check

Move the memcg_kmem_enabled() checks into memcg kmem charge/uncharge
functions, so, the users don't have to explicitly check that condition.

This is purely code cleanup patch without any functional change.  Only
the order of checks in memcg_charge_slab() can potentially be changed
but the functionally it will be same.  This should not matter as
memcg_charge_slab() is not in the hot path.
