tpm: take TPM chip power gating out of tpm_transmit()

Call tpm_chip_start() and tpm_chip_stop() in

* tpm_chip_register()
* tpm_class_shutdown()
* tpm_del_char_device()
* tpm_pm_suspend()
* tpm_try_get_ops() and tpm_put_ops()
* tpm2_del_space()

And remove these calls from tpm_transmit(). The core reason for this
change is that in tpm_vtpm_proxy a locality change requires a virtual
TPM command (a command made up just for that driver).

The consequence of this is that this commit removes the remaining nested
calls.
