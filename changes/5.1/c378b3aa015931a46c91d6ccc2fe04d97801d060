gpio: pca953x: Fix dereference of irq data in shutdown

If a PCA953x gpio was used as an interrupt and then released,
the shutdown function was trying to extract the pca953x_chip
pointer directly from the irq_data, but in reality was getting
the gpio_chip structure.

The net effect was that the subsequent writes to the data
structure corrupted data in the gpio_chip structure, which wasn't
immediately obvious until attempting to use the GPIO again in the
future, at which point the kernel panics.

This fix correctly extracts the pca953x_chip structure via the
gpio_chip structure, as is correctly done in the other irq
functions.
