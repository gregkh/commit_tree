ASoC: pcm: update module refcount if module_get_upon_open is set

Setting the module_get_upon_open field for component driver
prevents the module refcount from being incremented during
component probe(). This could lead to the module being
allowed to be unloaded when a pcm stream is open. So,
if this field is set, the module's refcount should be
incremented during pcm open to prevent module removal
when the component is in use. And, the refcount should
be decremented upon pcm close.
