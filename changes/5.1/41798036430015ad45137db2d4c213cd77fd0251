crypto: cavium/zip - fix collision with generic cra_driver_name

The cavium/zip implementation of the deflate compression algorithm is
incorrectly being registered under the generic driver name, which
prevents the generic implementation from being registered with the
crypto API when CONFIG_CRYPTO_DEV_CAVIUM_ZIP=y.  Similarly the lzs
algorithm (which does not currently have a generic implementation...)
is incorrectly being registered as lzs-generic.

Fix the naming collision by adding a suffix "-cavium" to the
cra_driver_name of the cavium/zip algorithms.
