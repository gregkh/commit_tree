iio: adc: add STMPE ADC devicetree bindings

This adds the devicetree bindings for the STMPE ADC. This also corrects
a typo in st,sample-time it is rather "6 -> 124 clocks" according
to the datasheet and not 144.
We need to use the naming stmpe_adc in devicetree because this is given
by the mfd device.
