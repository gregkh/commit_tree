ALSA: hda/realtek: Enable headset MIC of Acer TravelMate X514-51T with ALC255

The Acer TravelMate X514-51T with ALC255 cannot detect the headset MIC
until ALC255_FIXUP_ACER_HEADSET_MIC quirk applied.  Although, the
internal DMIC uses another module - snd_soc_skl as the driver.  We still
need the NID 0x1a in the quirk to enable the headset MIC.
