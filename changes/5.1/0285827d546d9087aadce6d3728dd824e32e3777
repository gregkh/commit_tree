pwm: atmel: Add support for controllers with 32 bit counters

SAM9X60's PWM controller uses 32 bits counters thus it could generate
signals with higher period and duty cycles than the old ones. Prepare
the current driver to be able to work with old controllers (that uses
16 bits counters) and with the new SAM9X60's controller, by providing
counters information based on compatible string.
