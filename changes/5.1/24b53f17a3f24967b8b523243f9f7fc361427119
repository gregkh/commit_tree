ASoC: es8316: Add DAC mono mix switch mixer control

Export the DAC functionality to mix left + right together and then output
the same (mixed) signal on both outputs.

Various (x86) tablets with an ES8316 codec use a single speaker
connected between the headhpone LOUT and ROUT pins, expecting the output
to be in a mono differential mode. Presumably this is done to use the
power of both the left and right outputs to allow the speaker to be
louder.

The ES8316 codec does not have a differential output mode, but we can
emulate this by making both channels output the same through the mono mix
switch, combined with setting the Playback Polarity control to "R Invert",
which applias a 180 degrees phase inversion to the right channel.
