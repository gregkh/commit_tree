lib/string.c: implement a basic bcmp

A recent optimization in Clang (r355672) lowers comparisons of the
return value of memcmp against zero to comparisons of the return value
of bcmp against zero.  This helps some platforms that implement bcmp
more efficiently than memcmp.  glibc simply aliases bcmp to memcmp, but
an optimized implementation is in the works.

This results in linkage failures for all targets with Clang due to the
undefined symbol.  For now, just implement bcmp as a tailcail to memcmp
to unbreak the build.  This routine can be further optimized in the
future.

Other ideas discussed:

 * A weak alias was discussed, but breaks for architectures that define
   their own implementations of memcmp since aliases to declarations are
   not permitted (only definitions). Arch-specific memcmp
   implementations typically declare memcmp in C headers, but implement
   them in assembly.

 * -ffreestanding also is used sporadically throughout the kernel.

 * -fno-builtin-bcmp doesn't work when doing LTO.
