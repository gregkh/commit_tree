net/mlx5e: Improve MQPRIO resiliency

* Add netdev->tc_to_txq rollback in case of failure in
  mlx5e_update_netdev_queues().
* Fix broken transition between the two modes:
  MQPRIO DCB mode with tc==8, and MQPRIO channel mode.
* Disable MQPRIO channel mode if re-attaching with a different number
  of channels.
* Improve code sharing.
