ovl: fix IOCB_DIRECT if underlying fs doesn't support direct IO

Normally the check at open time suffices, but e.g loop device does set
IOCB_DIRECT after doing its own checks (which are not sufficent for
overlayfs).

Make sure we don't call the underlying filesystem read/write method with
the IOCB_DIRECT if it's not supported.
