csky: Make HAVE_TCM depend on !COMPILE_TEST

Building csky:allmodconfig results in the following build errors.

arch/csky/mm/tcm.c:9:2: error:
		#error "You should define ITCM_RAM_BASE"
    9 | #error "You should define ITCM_RAM_BASE"
      |  ^~~~~
arch/csky/mm/tcm.c:14:2: error:
		#error "You should define DTCM_RAM_BASE"
   14 | #error "You should define DTCM_RAM_BASE"
      |  ^~~~~
arch/csky/mm/tcm.c:18:2: error:
		#error "You should define correct DTCM_RAM_BASE"
   18 | #error "You should define correct DTCM_RAM_BASE"

This is seen with compile tests since those enable HAVE_TCM,
but do not provide useful default values for ITCM_RAM_BASE or
DTCM_RAM_BASE. Disable HAVE_TCM for commpile tests to avoid
the error.
