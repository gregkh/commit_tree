drm/gem: Clear mapping addresses for unused framebuffer planes

Set the returned mapping address to NULL if a framebuffer plane does
not have a BO associated with it. Likewise, ignore mappings of NULL
during framebuffer unmap operations. Allows users of the functions to
perform unmap operations of certain BOs by themselfes.
