kselftest/arm64: Provide a helper binary and "library" for SVE RDVL

SVE provides an instruction RDVL which reports the currently configured
vector length. In order to validate that our vector length configuration
interfaces are working correctly without having to build the C code for
our test programs with SVE enabled provide a trivial assembly library
with a C callable function that executes RDVL. Since these interfaces
also control behaviour on exec*() provide a trivial wrapper program which
reports the currently configured vector length on stdout, tests can use
this to verify that behaviour on exec*() is as expected.

In preparation for providing similar helper functionality for SME, the
Scalable Matrix Extension, which allows separately configured vector
lengths to be read back both the assembler function and wrapper binary
have SVE included in their name.
