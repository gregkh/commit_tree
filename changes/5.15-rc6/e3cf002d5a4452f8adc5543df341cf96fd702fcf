net: pcs: xpcs: fix incorrect CL37 AN sequence

According to Synopsys DesignWare Cores Ethernet PCS databook, it is
required to disable Clause 37 auto-negotiation by programming bit-12
(AN_ENABLE) to 0 if it is already enabled, before programming various
fields of VR_MII_AN_CTRL registers.

After all these programming are done, it is then required to enable
Clause 37 auto-negotiation by programming bit-12 (AN_ENABLE) to 1.
