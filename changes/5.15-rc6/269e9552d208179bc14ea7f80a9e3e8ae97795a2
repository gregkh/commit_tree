KVM: const-ify all relevant uses of struct kvm_memory_slot

As alluded to in commit f36f3f2846b5 ("KVM: add "new" argument to
kvm_arch_commit_memory_region"), a bunch of other places where struct
kvm_memory_slot is used, needs to be refactored to preserve the
"const"ness of struct kvm_memory_slot across-the-board.
