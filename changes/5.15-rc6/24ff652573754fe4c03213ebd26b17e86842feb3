objtool: Teach get_alt_entry() about more relocation types

Occasionally objtool encounters symbol (as opposed to section)
relocations in .altinstructions. Typically they are the alternatives
written by elf_add_alternative() as encountered on a noinstr
validation run on vmlinux after having already ran objtool on the
individual .o files.

Basically this is the counterpart of commit 44f6a7c0755d ("objtool:
Fix seg fault with Clang non-section symbols"), because when these new
assemblers (binutils now also does this) strip the section symbols,
elf_add_reloc_to_insn() is forced to emit symbol based relocations.

As such, teach get_alt_entry() about different relocation types.
