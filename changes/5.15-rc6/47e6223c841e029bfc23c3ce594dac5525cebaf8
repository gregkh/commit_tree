KVM: arm64: Unregister HYP sections from kmemleak in protected mode

Booting a KVM host in protected mode with kmemleak quickly results
in a pretty bad crash, as kmemleak doesn't know that the HYP sections
have been taken away. This is specially true for the BSS section,
which is part of the kernel BSS section and registered at boot time
by kmemleak itself.

Unregister the HYP part of the BSS before making that section
HYP-private. The rest of the HYP-specific data is obtained via
the page allocator or lives in other sections, none of which is
subjected to kmemleak.
