iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Add and use static helper function arm_smmu_cmdq_issue_cmd_with_sync()

The obvious key to the performance optimization of commit 587e6c10a7ce
("iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Reduce contention during command-queue insertion") is
to allow multiple cores to insert commands in parallel after a brief mutex
contention.

Obviously, inserting as many commands at a time as possible can reduce the
number of times the mutex contention participates, thereby improving the
overall performance. At least it reduces the number of calls to function
arm_smmu_cmdq_issue_cmdlist().

Therefore, function arm_smmu_cmdq_issue_cmd_with_sync() is added to insert
the 'cmd+sync' commands at a time.
