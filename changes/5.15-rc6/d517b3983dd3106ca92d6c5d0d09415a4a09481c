ceph: reconnect to the export targets on new mdsmaps

In the case where the export MDS has crashed just after the EImportStart
journal is flushed, a standby MDS takes over for it and when replaying
the EImportStart journal the MDS will wait the client to reconnect. That
may never happen because the client may not have registered or opened
the sessions yet.

When receiving a new map, ensure we reconnect to valid export targets as
well if their sessions don't exist yet.
