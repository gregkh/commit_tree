ARM: at91: pm: preload base address of controllers in tlb

In suspend/resume procedure for AT91 architecture different controllers
(PMC, SHDWC, RAM, RAM PHY, SFRBU) are accessed to do the proper settings
for power saving. Commit f0bbf17958e8 ("ARM: at91: pm: add self-refresh
support for sama7g5") introduced the access to RAMC PHY controller for
SAMA7G5. The access to this controller is done after RAMC ports are
closed, thus any TLB walk necessary for RAMC PHY virtual address will
fail. In the development branch this was not encountered. However, on
current kernel the issue is reproducible.

To solve the issue the previous mechanism of pre-loading the TLB with
the RAMC PHY virtual address has been used. However, only the addition
of this new pre-load breaks the functionality for ARMv5 based
devices (SAM9X60). This behavior has been encountered previously
while debugging this code and using the same mechanism for pre-loading
address for different controllers (e.g. pin controller, the assumption
being that other requested translations are replaced from TLB).

To solve this new issue the TLB flush + the extension of pre-loading
the rest of controllers to TLB (e.g. PMC, RAMC) has been added. The
rest of the controllers should have been pre-loaded previously, anyway.
