libbpf: Fix removal of inner map in bpf_object__create_map

If creating an outer map of a BTF-defined map-in-map fails (via
bpf_object__create_map()), then the previously created its inner map
won't be destroyed.

Fix this by ensuring that the destroy routines are not bypassed in the
case of a failure.
