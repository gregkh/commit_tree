i2c: acpi: fix resource leak in reconfiguration device addition

acpi_i2c_find_adapter_by_handle() calls bus_find_device() which takes a
reference on the adapter which is never released which will result in a
reference count leak and render the adapter unremovable.  Make sure to
put the adapter after creating the client in the same manner that we do
for OF.
