mm, slub: use migrate_disable() on PREEMPT_RT

We currently use preempt_disable() (directly or via get_cpu_ptr()) to stabilize
the pointer to kmem_cache_cpu. On PREEMPT_RT this would be incompatible with
the list_lock spinlock. We can use migrate_disable() instead, but that
increases overhead on !PREEMPT_RT as it's an unconditional function call.

In order to get the best available mechanism on both PREEMPT_RT and
!PREEMPT_RT, introduce private slub_get_cpu_ptr() and slub_put_cpu_ptr()
wrappers and use them.
