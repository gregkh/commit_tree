io_uring: io_uring_complete() trace should take an integer

It currently takes a long, and while that's normally OK, the io_uring
limit is an int. Internally in io_uring it's an int, but sometimes it's
passed as a long. That can yield confusing results where a completions
seems to generate a huge result:

ou-sqp-1297-1298    [001] ...1   788.056371: io_uring_complete: ring 000000000e98e046, user_data 0x0, result 4294967171, cflags 0

which is due to -ECANCELED being stored in an unsigned, and then passed
in as a long. Using the right int type, the trace looks correct:

iou-sqp-338-339     [002] ...1    15.633098: io_uring_complete: ring 00000000e0ac60cf, user_data 0x0, result -125, cflags 0
