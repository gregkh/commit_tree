ARM: dts: imx6dl-yapp4: Fix lp5562 LED driver probe

Since the LED multicolor framework support was added in commit
92a81562e695 ("leds: lp55xx: Add multicolor framework support to lp55xx")
LEDs on this platform stopped working.

Author of the framework attempted to accommodate this DT to the
framework in commit b86d3d21cd4c ("ARM: dts: imx6dl-yapp4: Add reg property
to the lp5562 channel node") but that is not sufficient. A color property
is now required even if the multicolor framework is not used, otherwise
the driver probe fails:

  lp5562: probe of 1-0030 failed with error -22

Add the color property to fix this.
