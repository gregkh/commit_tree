platform/chrome: cros_ec_proto: Send command again when timeout occurs

Sometimes kernel is trying to probe Fingerprint MCU (FPMCU) when it
hasn't initialized SPI yet. This can happen because FPMCU is restarted
during system boot and kernel can send message in short window
eg. between sysjump to RW and SPI initialization.
