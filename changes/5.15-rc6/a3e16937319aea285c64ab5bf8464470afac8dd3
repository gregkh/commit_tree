misc: gehc: Add SPI ID table

Currently autoloading for SPI devices does not use the DT ID table, it uses
SPI modalises. Supporting OF modalises is going to be difficult if not
impractical, an attempt was made but has been reverted, so ensure that
module autoloading works for this driver by adding a SPI ID table entry
for the device name part of the compatible - currently only the full
compatible is listed which isn't very idiomatic and won't match the
modalias that is generated.
