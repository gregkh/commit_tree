torture: Move parse-console.sh call to PATH-aware scripts

The last line of kvm-test-1-run-qemu.sh invokes parse-console.sh, but
kvm-test-1-run-qemu.sh is unaware of the PATH containing this script
and does not have the job title handy.  This commit therefore moves
the invocation of parse-console.sh to kvm-test-1-run.sh, which has
PATH and title at hand.  This commit does not add an invocation of
parse-console.sh to kvm-test-1-run-batch.sh because this latter script
is run in the background, and the information will be gathered at the
end of the full run.
