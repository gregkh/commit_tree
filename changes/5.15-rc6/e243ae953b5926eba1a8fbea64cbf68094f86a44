PCI: only build xen-pcifront in PV-enabled environments

The driver's module init function, pcifront_init(), invokes
xen_pv_domain() first thing. That construct produces constant "false"
when !CONFIG_XEN_PV. Hence there's no point building the driver in
non-PV configurations.

Drop the (now implicit and generally wrong) X86 dependency: At present,
XEN_PV can only be set when X86 is also enabled. In general an
architecture supporting Xen PV (and PCI) would want to have this driver
built.
