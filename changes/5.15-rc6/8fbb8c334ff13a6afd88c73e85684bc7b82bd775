arm64: dts: renesas: salvator-x(s): Factor out HDMI1 parts

Move the common parts related to the second HDMI interface on
Salvator-X(S) boards to salvator-common.dtsi, to reduce current and
avoid future duplication of board descriptions.

As this interface is not present on all SoCs that can be found on
Salvator-X(S), but only on R-Car H3, its description are protected by
the preprocessor symbol SOC_HAS_HDMI1, defined in r8a77951.dtsi.
