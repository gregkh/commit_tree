net/smc: improved fix wait on already cleared link

Commit 8f3d65c16679 ("net/smc: fix wait on already cleared link")
introduced link refcounting to avoid waits on already cleared links.
This patch extents and improves the refcounting to cover all
remaining possible cases for this kind of error situation.
