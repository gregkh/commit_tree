device property: build kunit tests without structleak plugin

The structleak plugin causes the stack frame size to grow immensely when
used with KUnit:

../drivers/base/test/property-entry-test.c:492:1: warning: the frame size of 2832 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
../drivers/base/test/property-entry-test.c:322:1: warning: the frame size of 2080 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
../drivers/base/test/property-entry-test.c:250:1: warning: the frame size of 4976 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
../drivers/base/test/property-entry-test.c:115:1: warning: the frame size of 3280 bytes is larger than 2048 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
