scsi: ufs: core: Fix task management completion

The UFS driver uses blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() when identifying task
management requests to complete, however blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() doesn't
work.

blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() only iterates requests dispatched by the block
layer. That appears as if it might have started since commit 37f4a24c2469
("blk-mq: centralise related handling into blk_mq_get_driver_tag") which
removed 'data->hctx->tags->rqs[rq->tag] = rq' from blk_mq_rq_ctx_init()
which gets called:

	blk_get_request
		blk_mq_alloc_request
			__blk_mq_alloc_request
				blk_mq_rq_ctx_init

Since UFS task management requests are not dispatched by the block layer,
hctx->tags->rqs[rq->tag] remains NULL, and since blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter()
relies on finding requests using hctx->tags->rqs[rq->tag], UFS task
management requests are never found by blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter().

By using blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter(), the UFS driver was relying on internal
details of the block layer, which was fragile and subsequently got
broken. Fix by removing the use of blk_mq_tagset_busy_iter() and having the
driver keep track of task management requests.
