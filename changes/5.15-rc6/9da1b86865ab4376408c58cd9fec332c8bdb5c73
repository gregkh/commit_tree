iio: adis16475: fix deadlock on frequency set

With commit 39c024b51b560
("iio: adis16475: improve sync scale mode handling"), two deadlocks were
introduced:
 1) The call to 'adis_write_reg_16()' was not changed to it's unlocked
    version.
 2) The lock was not being released on the success path of the function.

This change fixes both these issues.
