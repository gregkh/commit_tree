riscv/vdso: Move vdso data page up front

As commit 601255ae3c98 ("arm64: vdso: move data page before code pages"), the
same issue exists on riscv, testcase is shown below, make sure that vdso.so is
bigger than page size,

  struct timespec tp;
  clock_gettime(5, &tp);
  printf("tv_sec: %ld, tv_nsec: %ld\n", tp.tv_sec, tp.tv_nsec);

without this patch, test result : tv_sec: 0, tv_nsec: 0
   with this patch, test result : tv_sec: 1629271537, tv_nsec: 748000000

Move the vdso data page in front of the VDSO area to fix the issue.
