cgroup/cpuset: Change references of cpuset_mutex to cpuset_rwsem

Since commit 1243dc518c9d ("cgroup/cpuset: Convert cpuset_mutex to
percpu_rwsem"), cpuset_mutex has been replaced by cpuset_rwsem which is
a percpu rwsem. However, the comments in kernel/cgroup/cpuset.c still
reference cpuset_mutex which are now incorrect.

Change all the references of cpuset_mutex to cpuset_rwsem.
