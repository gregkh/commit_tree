net: mscc: ocelot: fix VCAP filters remaining active after being deleted

When ocelot_flower.c calls ocelot_vcap_filter_add(), the filter has a
given filter->id.cookie. This filter is added to the block->rules list.

However, when ocelot_flower.c calls ocelot_vcap_block_find_filter_by_id()
which passes the cookie as argument, the filter is never found by
filter->id.cookie when searching through the block->rules list.

This is unsurprising, since the filter->id.cookie is an unsigned long,
but the cookie argument provided to ocelot_vcap_block_find_filter_by_id()
is a signed int, and the comparison fails.
