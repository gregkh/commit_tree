netfilter: ip6_tables: zero-initialize fragment offset

ip6tables only sets the `IP6T_F_PROTO` flag on a rule if a protocol is
specified (`-p tcp`, for example).  However, if the flag is not set,
`ip6_packet_match` doesn't call `ipv6_find_hdr` for the skb, in which
case the fragment offset is left uninitialized and a garbage value is
passed to each matcher.
