xen/x86: adjust data placement

Both xen_pvh and xen_start_flags get written just once early during
init. Using the respective annotation then allows the open-coded placing
in .data to go away.

Additionally the former, like the latter, wants exporting, or else
xen_pvh_domain() can't be used from modules.
