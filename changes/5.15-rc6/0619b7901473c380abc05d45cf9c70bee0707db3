btrfs: prevent __btrfs_dump_space_info() to underflow its free space

It's not uncommon where __btrfs_dump_space_info() gets called
under over-commit situations.

In that case free space would underflow as total allocated space is not
enough to handle all the over-committed space.

Such underflow values can sometimes cause confusion for users enabled
enospc_debug mount option, and takes some seconds for developers to
convert the underflow value to signed result.

Just output the free space as s64 to avoid such problem.
