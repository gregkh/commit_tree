firmware: arm_scmi: Add method to override max message number

The maximum number of simultaneously pending messages is a transport
specific quantity that is usually described statically in struct scmi_desc.

Some transports, though, can calculate such number only at run-time after
some initial transport specific setup and probing is completed; moreover
the resulting max message numbers could also be different between rx and
tx channels.

Add an optional get_max_msg() operation so that a transport can report more
accurate max message numbers for each channel type.

The value in scmi_desc.max_msg is still used as default when transport does
not provide any get_max_msg() method.
