s390/qeth: fix deadlock during failing recovery

Commit 0b9902c1fcc5 ("s390/qeth: fix deadlock during recovery") removed
taking discipline_mutex inside qeth_do_reset(), fixing potential
deadlocks. An error path was missed though, that still takes
discipline_mutex and thus has the original deadlock potential.

Intermittent deadlocks were seen when a qeth channel path is configured
offline, causing a race between qeth_do_reset and ccwgroup_remove.
Call qeth_set_offline() directly in the qeth_do_reset() error case and
then a new variant of ccwgroup_set_offline(), without taking
discipline_mutex.
