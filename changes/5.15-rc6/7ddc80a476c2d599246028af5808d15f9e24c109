bpf: Teach stack depth check about async callbacks.

Teach max stack depth checking algorithm about async callbacks
that don't increase bpf program stack size.
Also add sanity check that bpf_tail_call didn't sneak into async cb.
It's impossible, since PTR_TO_CTX is not available in async cb,
hence the program cannot contain bpf_tail_call(ctx,...);
