perf symbol: Look for ImageBase in PE file to compute .text offset

Instead of using the file offset in the debug file.

This fixes a regression from 00a3423492bc90be ("perf symbols: Make
dso__load_bfd_symbols() load PE files from debug cache only"), causing
incorrect symbol resolution when debug file have been stripped from
non-debug sections (in which case its .text section is empty and doesn't
have any file position).

The debug files could also be created with a different file alignment,
and have different file positions from the mmap-ed binary, or have the
section reordered.

This instead looks for the file image base, using the corresponding bfd
*ABS* symbols. As PE symbols only have 4 bytes, it also needs to keep
.text section vma high bits.
