r8152: avoid to resubmit rx immediately

For the situation that the disconnect event comes very late when the
device is unplugged, the driver would resubmit the RX bulk transfer
after getting the callback with -EPROTO immediately and continually.
Finally, soft lockup occurs.

This patch avoids to resubmit RX immediately. It uses a workqueue to
schedule the RX NAPI. And the NAPI would resubmit the RX. It let the
disconnect event have opportunity to stop the submission before soft
lockup.
