mac80211: add support for BSS color change

The color change announcement is very similar to how CSA works where
we have an IE that includes a counter. When the counter hits 0, the new
color is applied via an updated beacon.

This patch makes the CSA counter functionality reusable, rather than
implementing it again. This also allows for future reuse incase support
for other counter IEs gets added.
