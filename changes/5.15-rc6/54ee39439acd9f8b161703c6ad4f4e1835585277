iavf: fix double unlock of crit_lock

The crit_lock mutex could be unlocked twice as reported here
https://lists.osuosl.org/pipermail/intel-wired-lan/Week-of-Mon-20210823/025525.html

Remove the superfluous unlock. Technically the problem was already
present before 5ac49f3c2702 as that commit only replaced the locking
primitive, but no functional change.
