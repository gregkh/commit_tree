ALSA: usb-audio: make array static const, makes object smaller

Don't populate array names_to_check on the stack but instead it
static.  Makes the object code smaller by 56 bytes.  Also clean
up checkpatch warning by adding extra const for names_to_check
and pointer s.

Before:
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  103512   34380       0  137892   21aa4 ./sound/usb/mixer.o

After:
    text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
  103264   34572       0  137836   21a6c ./sound/usb/mixer.o
