arm64: dts: fvp: Remove panel timings

The simple-panel driver already has hard-coded timings for
"arm,rtsm-display", and as such screams at us for trying to override a
fixed mode from DT. Since the exact values probably don't matter all
that much anyway, just remove the DT node to keep boot quiet.
