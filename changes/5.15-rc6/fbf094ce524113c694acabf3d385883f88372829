selftests: KVM: Call ucall_init when setting up in rseq_test

While x86 does not require any additional setup to use the ucall
infrastructure, arm64 needs to set up the MMIO address used to signal a
ucall to userspace. rseq_test does not initialize the MMIO address,
resulting in the test spinning indefinitely.

Fix the issue by calling ucall_init() during setup.
