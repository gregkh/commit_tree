xhci: Enable trust tx length quirk for Fresco FL11 USB controller

Tested on SD5200T TB3 dock which has Fresco Logic FL1100 USB 3.0 Host
Controller.
Before this patch streaming video from USB cam made mouse and keyboard
connected to the same USB bus unusable. Also video was jerky.
With this patch streaming video doesn't have any effect on other
periferals and video is smooth.
