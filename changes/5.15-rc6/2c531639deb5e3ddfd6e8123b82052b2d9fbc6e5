bpf: Add support for {set|get} socket options from setsockopt BPF

Add logic to call bpf_setsockopt() and bpf_getsockopt() from setsockopt BPF
programs. An example use case is when the user sets the IPV6_TCLASS socket
option, we would also like to change the tcp-cc for that socket.

We don't have any use case for calling bpf_setsockopt() from supposedly read-
only sys_getsockopt(), so it is made available to BPF_CGROUP_SETSOCKOPT only
at this point.
