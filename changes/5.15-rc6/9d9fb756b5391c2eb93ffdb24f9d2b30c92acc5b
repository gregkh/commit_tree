drm/vc4: hdmi: Limit noise when deferring snd card registration

We don't want to print an error message each time
devm_snd_soc_register_card() returns -EPROBE_DEFER, the function will
most likely succeed some time in the future, once the missing resources
are available. So use dev_err_probe(), which will redirect the messages
to the debug log level in such case.
