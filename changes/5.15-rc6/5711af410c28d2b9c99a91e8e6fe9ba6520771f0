dt-bindings: phy: renesas,usb2-phy: Document RZ/G2L phy bindings

Document USB phy bindings for RZ/G2L SoC.

RZ/G2L USB2.0 phy uses line ctrl register for OTG_ID pin changes. It uses
a different OTG-BC interrupt bit for device recognition. Apart from this,
the PHY reset is controlled by USBPHY control IP and Document reset is a
required property.
