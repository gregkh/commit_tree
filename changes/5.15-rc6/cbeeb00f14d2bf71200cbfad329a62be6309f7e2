drm/i915/display: fix level 0 adjustement on display ver >= 12

We should no longer increment level 0 by 1usec when we have 16Gb DIMMs.
Instead spec says to add 3usec (as opposed to 2) to each valid level
when punit replies 0 to level 0.

So set wm_lv_0_adjust_needed to false for DISPLAY_VER() >= 12 and set
the proper adjustment value when handling WaWmMemoryReadLatency.
