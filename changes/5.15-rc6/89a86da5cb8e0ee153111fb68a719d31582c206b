iio: adc: ad7192: Add IRQ flag

IRQ type in ad_sigma_delta_info struct was missing.

In Sigma-Delta devices the SDO line is also used as an interrupt.
Leaving IRQ on level instead of falling might trigger a sample read
when the IRQ is enabled, as the SDO line is already low. Not sure
if SDO line will always immediately go high in ad_sd_buffer_postenable
before the IRQ is enabled.

Also the datasheet seem to explicitly say the falling edge of the SDO
should be used as an interrupt:
>From the AD7192 datasheet: "The DOUT/RDY falling edge can be used
as an interrupt to a processor,"
