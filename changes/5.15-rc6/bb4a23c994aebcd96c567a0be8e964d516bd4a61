riscv/vdso: Refactor asm/vdso.h

The asm/vdso.h will be included in vdso.lds.S in the next patch, the
following cleanup is needed to avoid syntax error:

 1.the declaration of sys_riscv_flush_icache() is moved into asm/syscall.h.
 2.the definition of struct vdso_data is moved into kernel/vdso.c.
 2.the definition of VDSO_SYMBOL is placed under "#ifndef __ASSEMBLY__".

Also remove the redundant linux/types.h include.
