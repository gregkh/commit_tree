octeontx2-pf: Don't mask out supported link modes

Supported link modes are updated by firmware in shared
structure per interface. Kernel uses this value to display
supported link modes via ethtool.

Currently there is extra validation that firmware updated
modes are validated against internal list of supported modes.
As intenal list of supported modes are not updated frequently
new modes supported by firmware are not updated to ethtool.

Hence remove extra validation and report all firmware updated
modes.
