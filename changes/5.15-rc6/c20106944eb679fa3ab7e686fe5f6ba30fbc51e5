NFSD: Keep existing listeners on portlist error

If nfsd has existing listening sockets without any processes, then an error
returned from svc_create_xprt() for an additional transport will remove
those existing listeners.  We're seeing this in practice when userspace
attempts to create rpcrdma transports without having the rpcrdma modules
present before creating nfsd kernel processes.  Fix this by checking for
existing sockets before calling nfsd_destroy().
