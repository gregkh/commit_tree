ALSA: core: Add managed card creation

As a second step for preliminary to widen the devres usages among
sound drivers, this patch adds a new ALSA core API function,
snd_devm_card_new(), to create a snd_card object via devres.
When a card object is created by this new function, snd_card_free() is
called automatically and the card object resource gets released at the
device unbinding time.

However, the story isn't that simple.  A caveat is that we have to
call snd_card_free() at the very first of the whole resource release
procedure, in order to assure that the all exposed devices on
user-space are deleted and sync with processes accessing those devices
before releasing resources.

For achieving it, snd_card_register() adds a new devres action to
trigger snd_card_free() automatically when the given card object is a
"managed" one.  Since usually snd_card_register() is the last step of
the initialization, this should work in most cases.

With all these tricks, some drivers can get rid of the whole driver
remove callback code.

About a bit of implementation details: the patch adds two new flags to
snd_card object: managed and releasing.  The former indicates that the
object was created via snd_devm_card_new(), and the latter is used for
avoiding the double-free of snd_card_free() calls.  Both flags are
fairly internal and likely uninteresting to normal users.
