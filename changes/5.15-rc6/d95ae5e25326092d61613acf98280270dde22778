erofs: add support for the full decompressed length

Previously, there is no need to get the full decompressed length since
EROFS supports partial decompression. However for some other cases
such as fiemap, the full decompressed length is necessary for iomap to
make it work properly.

This patch adds a way to get the full decompressed length. Note that
it takes more metadata overhead and it'd be avoided if possible in the
performance sensitive scenario.
