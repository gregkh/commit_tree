usb: gadget: f_uac2: Populate SS descriptors' wBytesPerInterval

For Isochronous endpoints, the SS companion descriptor's
wBytesPerInterval field is required to reserve bus time in order
to transmit the required payload during the service interval.
If left at 0, the UAC2 function is unable to transact data on its
playback or capture endpoints in SuperSpeed mode.

Since f_uac2 currently does not support any bursting this value can
be exactly equal to the calculated wMaxPacketSize.

Tested with Windows 10 as a host.
