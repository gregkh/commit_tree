mips: clean up kernel-doc in cavium-octeon/*.c

Convert function comments to kernel-doc notation to remove
kernel-doc warnings in arch/mips/cavium-octeon/*.c.
Also clean up the comments in a few places.

   arch/mips/cavium-octeon/flash_setup.c:66: warning: This comment starts with '/**', but isn't a kernel-doc comment. Refer Documentation/doc-guide/kernel-doc.rst
