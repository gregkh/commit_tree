usb: typec: tcpm: Support non-PD mode

Even if the Type-C controller supports PD, it is doable to disable PD
capabilities with the current state machine in TCPM. Without enabling RX
in low-level drivers and with skipping the power negotiation, the port
is eligible to be a non-PD Type-C port. Use new flags whose values are
populated from the device tree to decide the port PD capability. Adding
"pd-disable" property in device tree indicates that the port does not
support PD. If PD is not supported, the device tree property
"typec-power-opmode" shall be added to specify the advertised Rp value
if the port supports SRC role.
