io_uring: optimise io_cqring_wait() hot path

Turns out we always init struct io_wait_queue in io_cqring_wait(), even
if it's not used after, i.e. there are already enough of CQEs. And often
it's exactly what happens, for instance, requests may have been
completed inline, or in case of io_uring_enter(submit=N, wait=1).

It shows up in my profiler, so optimise it by delaying the struct init.
