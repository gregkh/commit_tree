i2c: dev: Use sysfs_emit() in "show" functions

The sysfs_emit() function was introduced to make it less ambiguous
which function is preferred when writing to the output buffer in
a "show" callback [1].

Convert the IÂ²C device sysfs interface from sprintf() to sysfs_emit()
accordingly, as the latter is aware of the PAGE_SIZE buffer and correctly
returns the number of bytes written into the buffer.

No functional change intended.
