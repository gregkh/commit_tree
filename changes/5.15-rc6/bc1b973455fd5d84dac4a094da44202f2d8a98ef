tracing/probes: Allow for dot delimiter as well as slash for system names

Kprobe and uprobe events can add a "system" to the events that are created
via the kprobe_events and uprobe_events files respectively. If they do not
include a "system" in the name, then the default "kprobes" or "uprobes" is
used. The current notation to specify a system for one of these probe
events is to add a '/' delimiter in the name, where the content before the
'/' will be the system to use, and the content after will be the event
name.

 echo 'p:my_system/my_event' > kprobe_events

But this is inconsistent with the way histogram triggers separate their
system / event names. The histogram triggers use a '.' delimiter, which
can be confusing.

To allow this to be more consistent, as well as keep backward
compatibility, allow the kprobe and uprobe events to denote a system name
with either a '/' or a '.'.

That is:

  echo 'p:my_system/my_event' > kprobe_events

is equivalent to:

  echo 'p:my_system.my_event' > kprobe_events
