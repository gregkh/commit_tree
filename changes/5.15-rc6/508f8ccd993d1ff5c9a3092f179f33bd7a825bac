regulator: rt6245: make a const array func_base static, makes object smaller

Don't populate the const array func_base on the stack but instead it
static. Makes the object code smaller by 55 bytes:

Before:
   text    data     bss     dec    hex filename
   6422    3216      64    9702   25e6 drivers/regulator/rt6245-regulator.o

After:
   text    data     bss     dec    hex filename
   6303    3280      64    9647   25af drivers/regulator/rt6245-regulator.o

Reduction of 55 bytes
