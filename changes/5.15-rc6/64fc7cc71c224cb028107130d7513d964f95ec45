drm/i915: move vma slab to direct module init/exit

With the global kmem_cache shrink infrastructure gone there's nothing
special and we can convert them over.

I'm doing this split up into each patch because there's quite a bit of
noise with removing the static global.slab_vmas to just a
slab_vmas.

We have to keep i915_drv.h include in i915_globals otherwise there's
nothing anymore that pulls in GEM_BUG_ON.

v2: Make slab static (Jason, 0day)
