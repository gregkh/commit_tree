perf/core: fix userpage->time_enabled of inactive events

Users of rdpmc rely on the mmapped user page to calculate accurate
time_enabled. Currently, userpage->time_enabled is only updated when the
event is added to the pmu. As a result, inactive event (due to counter
multiplexing) does not have accurate userpage->time_enabled. This can
be reproduced with something like:

   /* open 20 task perf_event "cycles", to create multiplexing */

   fd = perf_event_open();  /* open task perf_event "cycles" */
   userpage = mmap(fd);     /* use mmap and rdmpc */

   while (true) {
     time_enabled_mmap = xxx; /* use logic in perf_event_mmap_page */
     time_enabled_read = read(fd).time_enabled;
     if (time_enabled_mmap > time_enabled_read)
         BUG();
   }

Fix this by updating userpage for inactive events in merge_sched_in.
