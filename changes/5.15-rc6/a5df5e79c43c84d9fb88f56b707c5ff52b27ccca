nvme: allow user toggling hmb usage

The NVMe host memory buffer may consume a non-negligable amount of
memory. Controllers are required to function without the host memory
buffer enabled, but with possibly degraded performance. Export a sysfs
property to toggle this feature on a per-device granularity so users may
choose to reclaim memory at the expense of storage performance.
