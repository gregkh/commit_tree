clk: qcom: dispcc-sm8250: Add additional parent clocks for DP

The clock controller has two additional clock source pairs, in order to
support more than a single DisplayPort PHY. List these, so it's possible
to describe them all.

Also drop the unnecessary freq_tbl for the link clock sources, to allow
these parents to be used.
