platform/x86: intel_skl_int3472: Correct null check

The int3472-discrete driver can enter an error path after initialising
int3472->clock.ena_gpio, but before it has registered the clock. This will
cause a NULL pointer dereference, because clkdev_drop() is not null aware.
Instead of guarding the call to skl_int3472_unregister_clock() by checking
for .ena_gpio, check specifically for the presence of the clk_lookup, which
will guarantee clkdev_create() has already been called.
