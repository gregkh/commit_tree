KVM: VMX: Remove explicit MMU reset in enter_rmode()

Drop an explicit MMU reset when entering emulated real mode now that the
vCPU INIT/RESET path correctly handles conditional MMU resets, e.g. if
INIT arrives while the vCPU is in 64-bit mode.

Note, while there are multiple other direct calls to vmx_set_cr0(), i.e.
paths that change CR0 without invoking kvm_post_set_cr0(), only the INIT
emulation can reach enter_rmode().  CLTS emulation only toggles CR.TS,
VM-Exit (and late VM-Fail) emulation cannot architecturally transition to
Real Mode, and VM-Enter to Real Mode is possible if and only if
Unrestricted Guest is enabled (exposed to L1).

This effectively reverts commit 8668a3c468ed ("KVM: VMX: Reset mmu
context when entering real mode")
