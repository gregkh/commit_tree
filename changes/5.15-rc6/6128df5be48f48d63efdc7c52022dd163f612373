ARC: mm: use SCRATCH_DATA0 register for caching pgdir in ARCv2 only

MMU SCRATCH_DATA0 register is intended to cache task pgd. However in
ARC700 SMP port, it has to be repurposed for re-entrant interrupt
handling, while UP port doesn't. We currently handle these use-cases
using a fabricated #define which has usual issues of dependency nesting
and obvious ugliness.

So clean this up: for ARC700 don't use to cache pgd (even in UP) and do
the opposite for ARCv2.

And while here, switch to canonical pgd_offset().
