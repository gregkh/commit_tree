ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: tag SoundWire BEs as non-atomic

The SoundWire BEs make use of 'stream' functions for .prepare and
.trigger. These functions will in turn force a Bank Switch, which
implies a wait operation.

Mark SoundWire BEs as nonatomic for consistency, but keep all other
types of BEs as is. The initialization of .nonatomic is done outside
of the create_sdw_dailink helper to avoid adding more parameters to
deal with a single exception to the rule that BEs are atomic.
