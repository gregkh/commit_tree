iommu/io-pgtable: Abstract iommu_iotlb_gather access

Previously io-pgtable merely passed the iommu_iotlb_gather pointer
through to helpers, but now it has grown its own direct dereference.
This turns out to break the build for !IOMMU_API configs where the
structure only has a dummy definition. It will probably also crash
drivers who don't use the gather mechanism and simply pass in NULL.

Wrap this dereference in a suitable helper which can both be stubbed
out for !IOMMU_API and encapsulate a NULL check otherwise.
