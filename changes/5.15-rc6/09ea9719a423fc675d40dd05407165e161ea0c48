media: venus: venc: Fix potential null pointer dereference on pointer fmt

Currently the call to find_format can potentially return a NULL to
fmt and the nullpointer is later dereferenced on the assignment of
pixmp->num_planes = fmt->num_planes.  Fix this by adding a NULL pointer
check and returning NULL for the failure case.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference null return")
