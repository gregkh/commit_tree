ext4: check and update i_disksize properly

After commit 3da40c7b0898 ("ext4: only call ext4_truncate when size <=
isize"), i_disksize could always be updated to i_size in ext4_setattr(),
and we could sure that i_disksize <= i_size since holding inode lock and
if i_disksize < i_size there are delalloc writes pending in the range
upto i_size. If the end of the current write is <= i_size, there's no
need to touch i_disksize since writeback will push i_disksize upto
i_size eventually. So we can switch to check i_size instead of
i_disksize in ext4_da_write_end() when write to the end of the file.
we also could remove ext4_mark_inode_dirty() together because we defer
inode dirtying to generic_write_end() or ext4_da_write_inline_data_end().
