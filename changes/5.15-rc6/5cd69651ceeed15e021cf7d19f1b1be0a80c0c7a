powerpc/powernv/pci: Set the IRQ chip data for P8/CXL devices

Before MSI domains, the default IRQ chip of PHB3 MSIs was patched by
pnv_set_msi_irq_chip() with the custom EOI handler pnv_ioda2_msi_eoi()
and the owning PHB was deduced from the 'ioda.irq_chip' field. This
path has been deprecated by the MSI domains but it is still in use by
the P8 CAPI 'cxl' driver.

Rewriting this driver to support MSI would be a waste of time.
Nevertheless, we can still remove the IRQ chip patch and set the IRQ
chip data instead. This is cleaner.
