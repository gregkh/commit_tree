drm/i915/gt: rename legacy engine->hw_id to engine->gen6_hw_id

We kept adding new engines and for that increasing hw_id unnecessarily:
it's not used since GRAPHICS_VER == 8. Prepend "gen6" to the field and
try to pack it in the structs to give a hint this field is actually not
used in recent platforms.
