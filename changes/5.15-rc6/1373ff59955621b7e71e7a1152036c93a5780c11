libbpf: Introduce 'btf_custom_path' to 'bpf_obj_open_opts'

btf_custom_path allows developers to load custom BTF which libbpf will
subsequently use for CO-RE relocation instead of vmlinux BTF.

Having btf_custom_path in bpf_object_open_opts one can directly use the
skeleton's <objname>_bpf__open_opts() API to pass in the btf_custom_path
parameter, as opposed to using bpf_object__load_xattr() which is slated to be
deprecated ([0]).

This work continues previous work started by another developer ([1]).
