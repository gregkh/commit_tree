string_helpers: Escape double quotes in escape_special

From an abstract point of view, escape_special's counterpart,
unescape_special, already handles the unescaping of blackslashed double
quote sequences.

As a more practical example, printk indexing is an example case where
this is already practically useful. Compare an example with
`ESCAPE_SPECIAL | ESCAPE_SPACE`, with quotes not escaped:

    [root@ktst ~]# grep drivers/pci/pci-stub.c:69 /sys/kernel/debug/printk/index/vmlinux
    <4> drivers/pci/pci-stub.c:69 pci_stub_init "pci-stub: invalid ID string "%s"\n"

...and the same after this patch:

    [root@ktst ~]# grep drivers/pci/pci-stub.c:69 /sys/kernel/debug/printk/index/vmlinux
    <4> drivers/pci/pci-stub.c:69 pci_stub_init "pci-stub: invalid ID string \"%s\"\n"

One can of course, alternatively, use ESCAPE_APPEND with a quote in
@only, but without this patch quotes are coerced into hex or octal which
can hurt readability quite significantly.

I've checked uses of ESCAPE_SPECIAL and %pE across the codebase, and I'm
pretty confident that this shouldn't affect any stable interfaces.
