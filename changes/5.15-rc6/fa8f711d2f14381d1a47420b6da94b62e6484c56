x86/resctrl: Pass configuration type to resctrl_arch_get_config()

The ctrl_val[] array for a struct rdt_hw_resource only holds
configurations of one type. The type is implicit.

Once the CDP resources are merged, the ctrl_val[] array will hold all
the configurations for the hardware resource. When a particular type of
configuration is needed, it must be specified explicitly.

Pass the expected type from the schema into resctrl_arch_get_config().
Nothing uses this yet, but once a single ctrl_val[] array is used for
the three struct rdt_hw_resources that share hardware, the type will be
used to return the correct configuration value from the shared array.
