igc: Use default cycle 'start' and 'end' values for queues

Sets default values for each queue cycle start and cycle end.
This allows some simplification in the handling of these
configurations as most TSN features in i225 require a cycle
to be configured.

In i225, cycle start and end time is required to be programmed
for CBS to work properly.
