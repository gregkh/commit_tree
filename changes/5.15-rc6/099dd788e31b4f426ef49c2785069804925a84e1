cifs: remove pathname for file from SPDX header

checkpatch complains about source files with filenames (e.g. in
these cases just below the SPDX header in comments at the top of
various files in fs/cifs). It also is helpful to change this now
so will be less confusing when the parent directory is renamed
e.g. from fs/cifs to fs/smb_client (or fs/smbfs)
