ALSA: usb-audio: Enable rate validation for Scarlett devices

The Scarlett device series from Focusrite Novation seem requiring the
sample rate validations as we've done for MOTU devices; otherwise the
driver probes invalid audioformat entries that contain the sample
rates that actually don't work, and this may result in an incomplete
setup as reported recently.

This patch adds the needed quirk flag for enabling the sample rate
validation for Focusrite Novation devices.
