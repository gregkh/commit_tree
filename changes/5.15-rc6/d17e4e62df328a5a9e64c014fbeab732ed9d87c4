clk: mediatek: make COMMON_CLK_MT8167* depend on COMMON_CLK_MT8167

I found that COMMON_CLK_MT8167* do not depend on COMMON_CLK_MT8167,
so it is possible to config:

CONFIG_COMMON_CLK_MT8167=n
CONFIG_COMMON_CLK_MT8167_*=y

Although it does not cause build breaks with such configuration,
I think it is clearer to make COMMON_CLK_MT8167* depend on
COMMON_CLK_MT8167.
