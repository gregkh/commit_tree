scsi: acornscsi: Remove scsi_cmd_to_tag() reference

Commit 756fb6a895af ("scsi: acornscsi: Remove tagged queuing vestiges")
mistakenly introduced a reference to function scsi_cmd_to_tag(). This
function does not exist as it was removed from an earlier series version
when I upstreamed the named commit - originally authored By Hannes - but
this reference still remained.

Fix by replacing the reference to scsi_cmd_to_tag() with
scsi_cmd_to_rq(scsi_scmd)->tag, which scsi_cmd_to_tag() was a wrapper for.
