drm/msm/a6xx: Track current ctx by seqno

In theory a context can be destroyed and a new one allocated at the same
address, making the pointer comparision to detect when we don't need to
update the current pagetables invalid.  Instead assign a sequence number
to each context on creation, and use this for the check.
