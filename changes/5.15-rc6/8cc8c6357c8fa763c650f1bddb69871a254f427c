tools: bpftool: Document and add bash completion for -L, -B options

The -L|--use-loader option for using loader programs when loading, or
when generating a skeleton, did not have any documentation or bash
completion. Same thing goes for -B|--base-btf, used to pass a path to a
base BTF object for split BTF such as BTF for kernel modules.

This patch documents and adds bash completion for those options.

Fixes: 75fa1777694c ("tools/bpftool: Add bpftool support for split BTF")
Fixes: d510296d331a ("bpftool: Use syscall/loader program in "prog load" and "gen skeleton" command.")
