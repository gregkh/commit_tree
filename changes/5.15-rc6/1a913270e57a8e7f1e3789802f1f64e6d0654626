iio: adc: ad7793: Fix IRQ flag

In Sigma-Delta devices the SDO line is also used as an interrupt.
Leaving IRQ on level instead of falling might trigger a sample read
when the IRQ is enabled, as the SDO line is already low. Not sure
if SDO line will always immediately go high in ad_sd_buffer_postenable
before the IRQ is enabled.

Also the datasheet seem to explicitly say the falling edge of the SDO
should be used as an interrupt:
>From the AD7793 datasheet: " The DOUT/RDY falling edge can be
used as an interrupt to a processor"
