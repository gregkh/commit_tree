drm/i915/gen12: Use fuse info to enable SFC

In Gen12 there are various fuse combinations and in each configuration
vdbox engine may be connected to SFC depending on which engines are
available, so we need to set the SFC capability based on fuse value from
the hardware. Even numbered physical instance always have SFC, odd
numbered physical instances have SFC only if previous even instance is
fused off.

v2:
 - Minor style & typo fixes (Tvrtko)
 - Drop an unwanted 'inline' (Tvrtko)
