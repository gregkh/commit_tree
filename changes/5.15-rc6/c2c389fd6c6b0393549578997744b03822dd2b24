fs/ntfs3: Remove unnecesarry remount flag handling

Remove unnecesarry remount flag handling. This does not do anything for
this driver. We have already set SB_NODIRATIME when we fill super. Also
noatime should be set from mount option. Now for some reson we try to
set it when remounting.

Lazytime part looks like it is copied from f2fs and there is own mount
parameter for it. That is why they use it. We do not set lazytime
anywhere in our code. So basically this just blocks lazytime when
remounting.
