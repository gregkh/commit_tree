arm64: dts: qcom: sm8150: Add UFS ICE capability

Add support for UFS ICE (Qualcomm Inline Crypto Engine) in
sm8150 SoC dts.

I tested this on SA8155p-adp board, which is a publicly
available development board that uses the sa8155p Qualcomm
Snapdragon SoC. SA8155p platform is similar to the SM8150,
so use this as base for now.

I tested the UFS ICE feature using 'fscrypt' test utility.
