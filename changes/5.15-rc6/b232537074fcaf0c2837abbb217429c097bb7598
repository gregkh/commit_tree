soc: ti: omap-prm: Fix external abort for am335x pruss

Starting with v5.15-rc1, we may now see some am335x beaglebone black
device produce the following error on pruss probe:

Unhandled fault: external abort on non-linefetch (0x1008) at 0xe0326000

This has started with the enabling of pruss for am335x in the dts files.

Turns out the is caused by the PRM reset handling not waiting for the
reset bit to clear. To fix the issue, let's always wait for the reset
bit to clear, even if there is a separate reset status register.

We attempted to fix a similar issue for dra7 iva with a udelay() in
commit effe89e40037 ("soc: ti: omap-prm: Fix occasional abort on reset
deassert for dra7 iva"). There is no longer a need for the udelay()
for dra7 iva reset either with the check added for reset bit clearing.
