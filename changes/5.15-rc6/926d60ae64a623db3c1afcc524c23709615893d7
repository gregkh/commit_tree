usb: xhci-mtk: modify the SOF/ITP interval for mt8195

There are 4 USB controllers on MT8195, the controllers (IP1~IP3,
exclude IP0) have a wrong default SOF/ITP interval which is
calculated from the frame counter clock 24Mhz by default, but
in fact, the frame counter clock is 48Mhz, so we should set
the accurate interval according to 48Mhz for those controllers.
Note: the first controller no need set it.
