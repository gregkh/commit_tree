power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Report register-address on readb / writeb errors

When fuel_gauge_reg_readb()/_writeb() fails, report which register we
were trying to read / write when the error happened.

Also reword the message a bit:
- Drop the axp288 prefix, dev_err() already prints this
- Switch from telegram / abbreviated style to a normal sentence, aligning
  the message with those from fuel_gauge_read_*bit_word()
