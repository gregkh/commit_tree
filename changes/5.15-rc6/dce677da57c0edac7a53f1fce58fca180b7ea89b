octeontx2-pf: Add vlan-etype to ntuple filters

NPC extraction profile marks layer types
NPC_LT_LB_CTAG for CTAG and NPC_LT_LB_STAG_QINQ for
STAG after parsing input packet. Those layer types
can be used to install ntuple filters using
vlan-etype option. Below are the commands and
corresponding behavior with this patch in place.

> alias nt "ethtool -U eth0 flow-type ether"

> nt vlan 5 m 0xf000 action 0
Input packets with outer VLAN id as 5 i.e,
stag packets with VLAN id 5 and ctag packets with
VLAN id as 5 are hit.

> nt vlan-etype 0x8100 action 0
All input ctag packets with any VLAN id are hit.

> nt vlan-etype 0x88A8 action 0
All input stag packets with any VLAN id are hit.

> nt vlan-etype 0x8100 vlan 5 m 0xf000 action 0
All input ctag packets with VLAN id 5 are hit.

> nt vlan-etype 0x88A8 vlan 5 m 0xf000 action 0
All input stag packets with VLAN id 5 are hit.
