ALSA: ice1724: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

This patch converts the resource management in PCI ice1724 driver with
devres as a clean up.  Each manual resource management is converted
with the corresponding devres helper, and the card object release is
managed now via card->private_free instead of a lowlevel snd_device.
Along with it, the chip_exit callback chain is moved into the card's
private_free instead of the PCI remove callback, too.

This should give no user-visible functional changes.
