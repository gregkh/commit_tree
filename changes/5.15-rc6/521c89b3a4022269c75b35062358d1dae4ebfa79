rcu: Print human-readable message for schedule() in RCU reader

The WARN_ON_ONCE() invocation within the CONFIG_PREEMPT=y version of
rcu_note_context_switch() triggers when there is a voluntary context
switch in an RCU read-side critical section, but there is quite a gap
between the output of that WARN_ON_ONCE() and this RCU-usage error.
This commit therefore converts the WARN_ON_ONCE() to a WARN_ONCE()
that explicitly describes the problem in its message.
