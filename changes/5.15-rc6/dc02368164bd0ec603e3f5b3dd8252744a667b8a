objtool: Make .altinstructions section entry size consistent

Commit e31694e0a7a7 ("objtool: Don't make .altinstructions writable")
aligned objtool-created and kernel-created .altinstructions section
flags, but there remains a minor discrepency in their use of a section
entry size: objtool sets one while the kernel build does not.

While sh_entsize of sizeof(struct alt_instr) seems intuitive, this small
deviation can cause failures with external tooling (kpatch-build).

Fix this by creating new .altinstructions sections with sh_entsize of 0
and then later updating sec->sh_size as alternatives are added to the
section.  An added benefit is avoiding the data descriptor and buffer
created by elf_create_section(), but previously unused by
elf_add_alternative().
