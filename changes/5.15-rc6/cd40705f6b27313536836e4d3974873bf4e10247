staging: r8188eu: remove inline markings from functions in rtw_br_ext.c

The compiler is free to ignore, or follow, "inline" markings so they
really have no use in .c files, so just remove them.

This allows functions to properly show up as being unused when all
callers to them are removed, otherwise gcc does not warn you about this.
