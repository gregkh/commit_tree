KVM: x86/mmu: Relocate kvm_mmu_page.tdp_mmu_page for better cache locality

Move "tdp_mmu_page" into the 1-byte void left by the recently removed
"mmio_cached" so that it resides in the first 64 bytes of kvm_mmu_page,
i.e. in the same cache line as the most commonly accessed fields.

Don't bother wrapping tdp_mmu_page in CONFIG_X86_64, including the field in
32-bit builds doesn't affect the size of kvm_mmu_page, and a future patch
can always wrap the field in the unlikely event KVM gains a 1-byte flag
that is 32-bit specific.

Note, the size of kvm_mmu_page is also unchanged on CONFIG_X86_64=y due
to it previously sharing an 8-byte chunk with write_flooding_count.

No functional change intended.
