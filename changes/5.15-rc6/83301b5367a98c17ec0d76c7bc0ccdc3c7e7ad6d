af_unix: Set TCP_ESTABLISHED for datagram sockets too

Currently only unix stream socket sets TCP_ESTABLISHED,
datagram socket can set this too when they connect to its
peer socket. At least __ip4_datagram_connect() does the same.

This will be used to determine whether an AF_UNIX datagram
socket can be redirected to in sockmap.
