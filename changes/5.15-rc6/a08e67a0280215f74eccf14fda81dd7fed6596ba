erofs: iomap support for non-tailpacking DIO

Add iomap support for non-tailpacking uncompressed data in order to
support DIO and DAX.

Direct I/O is useful in certain scenarios for uncompressed files.
For example, double pagecache can be avoid by direct I/O when
loop device is used for uncompressed files containing upper layer
compressed filesystem.

This adds iomap DIO support for non-tailpacking cases first and
tail-packing inline files are handled in the follow-up patch.
