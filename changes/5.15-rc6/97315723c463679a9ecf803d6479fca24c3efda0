xen/privcmd: drop "pages" parameter from xen_remap_pfn()

The function doesn't use it and all of its callers say in a comment that
their respective arguments are to be non-NULL only in auto-translated
mode. Since xen_remap_domain_mfn_array() isn't supposed to be used by
non-PV, drop the parameter there as well. It was bogusly passed as non-
NULL (PRIV_VMA_LOCKED) by its only caller anyway. For
xen_remap_domain_gfn_range(), otoh, it's not clear at all why this
wouldn't want / might not need to gain auto-translated support down the
road, so the parameter is retained there despite now remaining unused
(and the only caller passing NULL); correct a respective comment as
well.
