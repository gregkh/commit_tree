lib/test_stackinit: Allow building stand-alone

Especially now that GCC is developing the -ftrivial-auto-var-init
option[1], it's helpful to have a stand-alone userspace test for stack
variable initialization. Relicense to GPLv2+ (I am the only author),
provide stand-alone kernel macro stubs, and update comments for clarity.
