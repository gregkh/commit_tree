x86/resctrl: Allow different CODE/DATA configurations to be staged

Before the CDP resources can be merged, struct rdt_domain will need an
array of struct resctrl_staged_config, one per type of configuration.

Use the type as an index to the array to ensure that a schema
configuration string can't specify the same domain twice. This will
allow two schemata to apply configuration changes to one resource.
