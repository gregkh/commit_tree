can: flexcan: add mcf5441x support

Add flexcan support for NXP ColdFire mcf5441x family.

This flexcan module is quite similar to imx6 flexcan module, but
with some exceptions:

- 3 separate interrupt sources, MB, BOFF and ERR,
- implements 16 mb only,
- m68k architecture is not supporting devicetrees, so a
  platform data check/case has been added,
- ColdFire is m68k, so big-endian cpu, with a little-endian flexcan
  module.
