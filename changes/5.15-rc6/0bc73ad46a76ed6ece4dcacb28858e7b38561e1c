net/mlx5e: Mutually exclude RX-FCS and RX-port-timestamp

Due to current HW arch limitations, RX-FCS (scattering FCS frame field
to software) and RX-port-timestamp (improved timestamp accuracy on the
receive side) can't work together.
RX-port-timestamp is not controlled by the user and it is enabled by
default when supported by the HW/FW.
This patch sets RX-port-timestamp opposite to RX-FCS configuration.
