clk: zynqmp: Fix kernel-doc format

Align structure and function names with definitions.

Issues are reported by kernel-doc script as:
drivers/clk/zynqmp/clk-gate-zynqmp.c:24: warning: expecting prototype for
struct clk_gate. Prototype was for struct zynqmp_clk_gate instead
drivers/clk/zynqmp/clk-gate-zynqmp.c:75: warning: expecting prototype for
zynqmp_clk_gate_is_enable(). Prototype was for zynqmp_clk_gate_is_enabled()
instead
