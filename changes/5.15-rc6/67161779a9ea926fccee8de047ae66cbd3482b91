net/smc: Allow SMC-D 1MB DMB allocations

Commit a3fe3d01bd0d7 ("net/smc: introduce sg-logic for RMBs") introduced
a restriction for RMB allocations as used by SMC-R. However, SMC-D does
not use scatter-gather lists to back its DMBs, yet it was limited by
this restriction, still.
This patch exempts SMC, but limits allocations to the maximum RMB/DMB
size respectively.
