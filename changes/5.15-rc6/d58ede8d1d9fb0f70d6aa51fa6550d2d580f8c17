btrfs: simplify data stripe calculation helpers

There are two helpers doing the same calculations based on nparity and
ncopies. calc_data_stripes can be simplified into one expression, so far
we don't have profile with both copies and parity, so there's no
effective change. calc_stripe_length should reuse the helper and not
repeat the same calculation.
