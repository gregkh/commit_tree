drm/msm: Fix null pointer dereference on pointer edp

The initialization of pointer dev dereferences pointer edp before
edp is null checked, so there is a potential null pointer deference
issue. Fix this by only dereferencing edp after edp has been null
checked.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference before null check")
