mfd: Don't use irq_create_mapping() to resolve a mapping

Although irq_create_mapping() is able to deal with duplicate
mappings, it really isn't supposed to be a substitute for
irq_find_mapping(), and can result in allocations that take place
in atomic context if the mapping didn't exist.

Fix the handful of MFD drivers that use irq_create_mapping() in
interrupt context by using irq_find_mapping() instead.
