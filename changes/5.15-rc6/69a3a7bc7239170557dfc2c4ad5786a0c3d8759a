scsi: lpfc: Fix memory overwrite during FC-GS I/O abort handling

When an FC-GS I/O is aborted by lpfc, the driver requires a node pointer
for a dereference operation.  In the abort I/O routine, the driver miscasts
a context pointer to the wrong data type and overwrites a single byte
outside of the allocated space.  This miscast is done in the abort I/O
function handler because the handler works on both FC-GS and FC-LS
commands. However, the code neglected to get the correct job location for
the node.

Fix this by acquiring the necessary node pointer from the correct job
structure depending on the I/O type.
