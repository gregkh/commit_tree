mm/debug_vm_pgtable: use struct pgtable_debug_args in PTE modifying tests

This uses struct pgtable_debug_args in PTE modifying tests.  The allocated
page is used as set_pte_at() is used there.  The tests are skipped if the
allocated page doesn't exist.  It's notable that args->ptep need to be
mapped before the tests.  The reason why we don't map args->ptep at the
beginning is PTE entry is only mapped and accessible in atomic context
when CONFIG_HIGHPTE is enabled.  So we avoid to do that so that atomic
context is only enabled if needed.

Besides, the unused variable @pte_aligned and @ptep in debug_vm_pgtable()
are dropped.
