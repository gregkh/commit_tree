ice: remove dead code for allocating pin_config

We have code in the ice driver which allocates the pin_config structure
if n_pins is > 0, but we never set n_pins to be greater than zero.
There's no reason to keep this code until we actually have pin_config
support. Remove this. We can re-add it properly when we implement
support for pin_config for E810-T devices.
