9p: Fix a bunch of kerneldoc warnings shown up by W=1

Fix a bunch of kerneldoc warnings shown up by W=1 in the 9p filesystem:

 (1) Add/remove/fix kerneldoc parameters descriptions.

 (2) Move __add_fid() from between v9fs_fid_add() and its comment.

 (3) 9p's caches_show() doesn't really make sense as an API function, so
     remove the kerneldoc annotation.  It's also not prefixed with 'v9fs_'.
     Also remove the kerneldoc markers from the 9p fscache wrappers.
