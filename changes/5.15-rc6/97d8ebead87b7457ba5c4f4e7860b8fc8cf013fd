misc: HI6421V600_IRQ should depend on HAS_IOMEM

MFD_CORE depends on HAS_IOMEM so anything that selects MFD_CORE should
also depend on HAS_IOMEM since 'select' does not check any dependencies
of the symbol that is being selected.

Prevents this kconfig warning:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for MFD_CORE
  Depends on [n]: HAS_IOMEM [=n]
  Selected by [m]:
  - HI6421V600_IRQ [=m] && OF [=y] && SPMI [=m]

Fixes: bb3b6552a5b0 ("staging: hikey9xx: split hi6421v600 irq into a separate driver")
