phy: qcom-qmp: Fix sc8180x PCIe definition

A copy paste error was snuck into the patch going upstream that made the
SC8180x PCIe PHY use the SM8250 serdes table, but while this works
there's some differences in the tables (and the SC8180x was left
dangling). So correct the SC8180x definition to use the SC8180x serdes
table.
