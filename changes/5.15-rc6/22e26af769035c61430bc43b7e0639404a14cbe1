drm/i915: Fork DG1 interrupt handler

The current interrupt handler is getting increasingly complicated and
Xe_HP changes will bring even more complexity.  Let's split off a new
interrupt handler starting with DG1 (i.e., when the master tile
interrupt register was added to the design) and use that as the basis
for the new Xe_HP changes.

Now that we track the hardware IP's release number as well as the
version number, we can also properly define DG1 has version "12.10" and
replace the has_master_unit_irq feature flag with an IP version test.
