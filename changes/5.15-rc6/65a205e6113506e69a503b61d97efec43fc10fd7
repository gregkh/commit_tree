USB: cdc-acm: fix racy tty buffer accesses

A recent change that started reporting break events to the line
discipline caused the tty-buffer insertions to no longer be serialised
by inserting events also from the completion handler for the interrupt
endpoint.

Completion calls for distinct endpoints are not guaranteed to be
serialised. For example, in case a host-controller driver uses
bottom-half completion, the interrupt and bulk-in completion handlers
can end up running in parallel on two CPUs (high-and low-prio tasklets,
respectively) thereby breaking the tty layer's single producer
assumption.

Fix this by holding the read lock also when inserting characters from
the bulk endpoint.
