KVM: VMX: Don't _explicitly_ reconfigure user return MSRs on vCPU INIT

When emulating vCPU INIT, do not unconditionally refresh the list of user
return MSRs that need to be loaded into hardware when running the guest.
Unconditionally refreshing the list is confusing, as the vast majority of
MSRs are not modified on INIT.  The real motivation is to handle the case
where an INIT during long mode obviates the need to load the SYSCALL MSRs,
and that is handled as needed by vmx_set_efer().
