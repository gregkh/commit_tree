csky: Fixup regs.sr broken in ptrace

gpr_get() return the entire pt_regs (include sr) to userspace, if we
don't restore the C bit in gpr_set, it may break the ALU result in
that context. So the C flag bit is part of gpr context, that's why
riscv totally remove the C bit in the ISA. That makes sr reg clear
from userspace to supervisor privilege.
