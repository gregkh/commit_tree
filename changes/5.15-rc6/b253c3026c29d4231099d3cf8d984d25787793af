drm/hyperv: Fix double mouse pointers

Hyper-V supports a hardware cursor feature. It is not used by Linux VM,
but the Hyper-V host still draws a point as an extra mouse pointer,
which is unwanted, especially when Xorg is running.

The hyperv_fb driver uses synthvid_send_ptr() to hide the unwanted pointer.
When the hyperv_drm driver was developed, the function synthvid_send_ptr()
was not copied from the hyperv_fb driver. Fix the issue by adding the
function into hyperv_drm.
