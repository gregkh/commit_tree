mmc: mmc_spi: Simplify busy loop in mmc_spi_skip()

Infinite loops are hard to read and understand because of
hidden main loop condition. Simplify such one in mmc_spi_skip().

Using schedule() to schedule (and be friendly to others)
is discouraged and cond_resched() should be used instead.
Hence, replace schedule() with cond_resched() at the same
time.
