xen/x86: generalize preferred console model from PV to PVH Dom0

Without announcing hvc0 as preferred it won't get used as long as tty0
gets registered earlier. This is particularly problematic with there not
being any screen output for PVH Dom0 when the screen is in graphics
mode, as the necessary information doesn't get conveyed yet from the
hypervisor.

Follow PV's model, but be conservative and do this for Dom0 only for
now.
