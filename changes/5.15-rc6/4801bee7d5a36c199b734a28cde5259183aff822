ALSA: usb-audio: Add lowlatency module option

For making user to switch back to the old playback mode, this patch
adds a new module option 'lowlatency' to snd-usb-audio driver.
When user face a regression due to the recent low-latency playback
support, they can test easily by passing lowlatency=0 option without
rebuilding the kernel.
