fs/ntfs3: Fix a memory leak on object opts

Currently a failed allocation on sbi->upcase will cause an exit via
the label free_sbi causing a memory leak on object opts. Fix this by
re-ordering the exit paths free_opts and free_sbi so that kfree's occur
in the reverse allocation order.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Resource leak")
Fixes: 27fac77707a1 ("fs/ntfs3: Init spi more in init_fs_context than fill_super")
