s390: add HWCAP_S390_PCI_MIO to ELF hwcaps

In order to support the use of enhanced PCI instructions in both kernel-
and userspace we need both hardware support and proper setup in the
kernel. The latter can be toggled off with the pci=nomio command line
option.

Thus availability of this feature in userspace depends on all of kernel
configuration (CONFIG_PCI), hardware support and the current kernel
command line and can thus not rely solely on a facility bit. Instead
let's introduce a new ELF hardware capability bit HWCAP_S390_PCI_MIO to
tell userspace whether these PCI instructions can be used.
