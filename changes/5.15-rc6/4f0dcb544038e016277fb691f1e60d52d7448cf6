KVM: VMX: Remove direct write to vcpu->arch.cr0 during vCPU RESET/INIT

Remove a bogus write to vcpu->arch.cr0 that immediately precedes
vmx_set_cr0() during vCPU RESET/INIT.  For RESET, this is a nop since
the "old" CR0 value is meaningless.  But for INIT, if the vCPU is coming
from paging enabled mode, crushing vcpu->arch.cr0 will cause the various
is_paging() checks in vmx_set_cr0() to get false negatives.

For the exit_lmode() case, the false negative is benign as vmx_set_efer()
is called immediately after vmx_set_cr0().

For EPT without unrestricted guest, the false negative will cause KVM to
unnecessarily run with CR3 load/store exiting.  But again, this is
benign, albeit sub-optimal.
