can: c_can: support tx ring algorithm

The algorithm is already used successfully by other CAN drivers
(e.g. mcp251xfd). Its implementation was kindly suggested to me by
Marc Kleine-Budde following a patch I had previously submitted. You can
find every detail at https://lore.kernel.org/patchwork/patch/1422929/.

The idea is that after this patch, it will be easier to patch the driver
to use the message object memory as a true FIFO.
