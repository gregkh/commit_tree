fs/ntfs3: Show uid/gid always in show_options()

Show options should show option according documentation when some value
is not default or when ever coder wants. Uid/gid are problematic because
it is hard to know which are defaults. In file system there is many
different implementation for this problem.

Some file systems show uid/gid when they are different than root, some
when user has set them and some show them always. There is also problem
that what if root uid/gid change. This code just choose to show them
always. This way we do not need to think this any more.
