arm64: dts: ls1028a: fix eSDHC2 node

On the LS1028A this instance of the eSDHC controller is intended for
either an eMMC or eSDIO card. It doesn't provide a card detect pin and
its IO voltage is fixed at 1.8V.

Remove the bogus broken-cd property, instead add the non-removable
property. Fix the voltage-ranges property and set it to 1.8V only.
