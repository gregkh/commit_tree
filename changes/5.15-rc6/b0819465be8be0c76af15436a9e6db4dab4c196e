arm pl011 serial: support multi-irq request

In order to make pl011 work better, multiple interrupts are
required, such as TXIM, RXIM, RTIM, error interrupt(FE/PE/BE/OE);
at the same time, pl011 to GIC does not merge the interrupt
lines(each serial-interrupt corresponding to different GIC hardware
interrupt), so need to enable and request multiple gic interrupt
numbers in the driver.
