Revert "net: build all switchdev drivers as modules when the bridge is a module"

This reverts commit b0e81817629a496854ff1799f6cbd89597db65fd. Explicit
driver dependency on the bridge is no longer needed since
switchdev_bridge_port_{,un}offload() is no longer implemented by the
bridge driver but by switchdev.
