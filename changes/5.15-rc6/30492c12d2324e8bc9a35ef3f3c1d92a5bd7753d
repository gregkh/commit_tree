PCI: artpec6: Remove local code block from switch statement

The switch statement in the artpec6_pcie_probe() has a local code block
where "val" is defined and immediately used by the artpec6_pcie_readl().

This extra code block adds brackets at the same indentation level as the
switch statement itself which can hinder readability of the code.

Move the "val" declaration to the top of the function and remove
the extra code block from the switch statement.
