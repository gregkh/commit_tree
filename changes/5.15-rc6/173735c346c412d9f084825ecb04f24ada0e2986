dma-debug: fix debugfs initialization order

Due to link order, dma_debug_init is called before debugfs has a chance
to initialize (via debugfs_init which also happens in the core initcall
stage), so the directories for dma-debug are never created.

Decouple dma_debug_fs_init from dma_debug_init and defer its init until
core_initcall_sync (after debugfs has been initialized) while letting
dma-debug initialization occur as soon as possible to catch any early
mappings, as suggested in [1].
