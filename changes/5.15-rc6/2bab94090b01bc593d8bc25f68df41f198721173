spi: tegra20-slink: Declare runtime suspend and resume functions conditionally

The following build error is seen with CONFIG_PM=n.

drivers/spi/spi-tegra20-slink.c:1188:12: error:
	'tegra_slink_runtime_suspend' defined but not used
drivers/spi/spi-tegra20-slink.c:1200:12: error:
	'tegra_slink_runtime_resume' defined but not used

Declare the functions only if PM is enabled. While at it, remove the
unnecessary forward declarations.
