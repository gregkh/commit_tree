ALSA: hda - Enable headphone mic on Dell Latitude laptops with ALC3254

The headphone mic is not working on Dell Latitude laptops with ALC3254.
The codec vendor id is 0x10ec0295 and share the same pincfg as defined
in ALC295_STANDARD_PINS. So the ALC269_FIXUP_DELL1_MIC_NO_PRESENCE will
be applied per alc269_pin_fixup_tbl[] but actually the headphone mic is
using NID 0x1b instead of 0x1a. The ALC269_FIXUP_DELL4_MIC_NO_PRESENCE
need to be applied instead.

Use ALC269_FIXUP_DELL4_MIC_NO_PRESENCE for particular models before
a generic fixup comes out.
