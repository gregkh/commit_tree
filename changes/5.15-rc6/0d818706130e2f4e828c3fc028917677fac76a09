virtio: don't fail on !of_device_is_compatible

A recent change checking of_device_is_compatible on probe broke some
powerpc/pseries setups. Apparently there virtio devices do not have a
"compatible" property - they are matched by PCI vendor/device ids.

Let's just skip of_node setup but proceed with initialization like we
did previously.
