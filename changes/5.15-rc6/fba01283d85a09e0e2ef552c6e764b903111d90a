net: mscc: ocelot: deny TX timestamping of non-PTP packets

It appears that Ocelot switches cannot timestamp non-PTP frames,
I tested this using the isochron program at:
https://github.com/vladimiroltean/tsn-scripts

with the result that the driver increments the ocelot_port->ts_id
counter as expected, puts it in the REW_OP, but the hardware seems to
not timestamp these packets at all, since no IRQ is emitted.

Therefore check whether we are sending PTP frames, and refuse to
populate REW_OP otherwise.
