arm64: avoid double ISB on kernel entry

Although an ISB is required in order to make the MTE-related system
register update to GCR_EL1 effective, and the same is true for
PAC-related updates to SCTLR_EL1 or APIAKey{Hi,Lo}_EL1, we issue two
ISBs on machines that support both features while we only need to
issue one. To avoid the unnecessary additional ISB, remove the ISBs
from the PAC and MTE-specific alternative blocks and add a couple
of additional blocks that cause us to only execute one ISB if both
features are supported.
