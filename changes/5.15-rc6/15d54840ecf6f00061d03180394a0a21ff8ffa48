ASoC: rt5640: Delay requesting IRQ until the machine-drv calls set_jack

Delay requesting the IRQ until the machine-drv calls set_jack.

The main reason for this is that the codec's IRQ is unused on some boards,
in which case we really should not call request_irq at all.

On some boards there is an IRQ listed at index 0 for the codec, but
this is not connected to the codec, but rather is directly connected
to the jack's jack-detect pin. These special setups will be handled
by the machine-driver, but the machine driver can only request the IRQ
if it is not first requested by the codec driver. Moving the request_irq
to the set_jack callback (which will not get called in this case) avoids
the codec-driver clobbering the IRQ.

Moving the request_irq also removes the need to disable the IRQ immediately
after requesting it, avoiding a small race (this could also have been fixed
by using the new IRQF_NO_AUTOEN flag when requesting the IRQ).
