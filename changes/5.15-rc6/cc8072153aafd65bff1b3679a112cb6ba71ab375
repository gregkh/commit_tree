netfilter: iptable_raw: drop bogus net_init annotation

This is a leftover from the times when this function was wired up via
pernet_operations.  Now its called when userspace asks for the table.

With CONFIG_NET_NS=n, iptable_raw_table_init memory has been discarded
already and we get a kernel crash.

Other tables are fine, __net_init annotation was removed already.
