fs/ntfs3: Make binary search to search smaller chunks in beginning

We could try to optimize algorithm to first fill just small table and
after that use bigger table all the way up to ARRAY_SIZE(offs). This
way we can use bigger search array, but not lose benefits with entry
count smaller < ARRAY_SIZE(offs).
