xtensa: increase size of gcc stack frame check

xtensa frame size is larger than the frame size for almost all other
architectures.  This results in more than 50 "the frame size of <n> is
larger than 1024 bytes" errors when trying to build xtensa:allmodconfig.

Increase frame size for xtensa to 1536 bytes to avoid compile errors due
to frame size limits.
