dm ima: update dm documentation for ima measurement support

The ima documentation for measuring DM targets (dm-ima.rst) is
missing the attribute information for the targets - 'cache', 'integrity',
'multipath', and 'snapshot'.  It is also missing the grammar for
various DM events and targets, which can help the attestation servers
to determine what data to expect for a given DM device.  Further,
the documentation needs to be updated to incorporate code changes
made to DM ima events and targets as part of this patch series.  For
instance, prefixing the event names with "dm_", adding the DM version to
events, prefixing the table hashes in the ima log with the
hash algorithm etc.  There are warnings reported by 'make htmldocs' on
dm-ima.rst, which need to be fixed.  And lastly, the expected behavior
needs to be documented when the configuration CONFIG_IMA_DISABLE_HTABLE
is disabled.

Update the documentation to add examples for 'cache', 'integrity',
'multipath', and 'snapshot' targets.  Add the grammar for
various DM events and targets in Backus Naur form,
so that the attestation servers can interpret and act on the ima
measurements for DM target.  Fix htmldocs warnings in dm-ima.rst.  Update
the documentation to be consistent with the code changes that are part of
this patch series.
