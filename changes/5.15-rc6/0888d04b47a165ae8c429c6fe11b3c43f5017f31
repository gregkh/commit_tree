hwrng: Add Arm SMCCC TRNG based driver

The "Arm True Random Number Generator Firmware Interface"[1] provides
an SMCCC based interface to a true hardware random number generator.
So far we are using that in arch_get_random_seed(), but it might be
useful to expose the entropy through the /dev/hwrng device as well. This
allows to assess the quality of the implementation, by using "rngtest"
from the rng-tools package, for example.

Add a simple platform driver implementing the hw_random interface.
The corresponding platform device is created by the SMCCC core code,
we just match it here by name and provide a module alias.

Since the firmware takes care about serialisation, this can happily
coexist with the arch_get_random_seed() bits.
