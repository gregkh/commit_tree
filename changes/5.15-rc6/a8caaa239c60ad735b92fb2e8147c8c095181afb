arm64/sme: Document boot requirements for SME

Document our requirements for initialisation of the Scalable Matrix
Extension (SME) at kernel start. While we do have the ability to handle
mismatched vector lengths we will reject any late CPUs that can't support
the minimum set we determine at boot so for clarity we document a
requirement that all CPUs make the same vector length available.
