staging: r8188eu: remove _dbg_dump_tx_info function

Remove _dbg_dump_tx_info from hal/rtl8188e_xmit.c as it is just a
dumping function that contains a lot of unclear DBG_88E calls, and has
no other external effect, other than calling a function that ultimately
determines whether or not to dump/trigger the DBG_88E calls. Also remove
its declaration and single call site.
