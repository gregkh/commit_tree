KVM: arm64: Introduce hyp_assert_lock_held()

Introduce a poor man's lockdep implementation at EL2 which allows to
BUG() whenever a hyp spinlock is not held when it should. Hide this
feature behind a new Kconfig option that targets the EL2 object
specifically, instead of piggy backing on the existing CONFIG_LOCKDEP.
EL2 cannot WARN() cleanly to report locking issues, hence BUG() is the
only option and it is not clear whether we want this widely enabled.
This is most likely going to be useful for local testing until the EL2
WARN() situation has improved.
