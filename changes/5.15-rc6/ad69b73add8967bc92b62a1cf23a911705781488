drm/msm/dsi/phy: fix clock names in 28nm_8960 phy

The commit 9f91f22aafcd ("drm/msm/dsi: remove duplicate fields from
dsi_pll_Nnm instances") mistakenly changed registered clock names. While
the platform is in progress of migration to using clock properties in
the dts rather than the global clock names, we should provide backwards
compatibility. Thus restore registerd global clock names.
