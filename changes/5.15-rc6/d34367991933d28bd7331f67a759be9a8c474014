rtnetlink: fix if_nlmsg_stats_size() under estimation

rtnl_fill_statsinfo() is filling skb with one mandatory if_stats_msg structure.

nlmsg_put(skb, pid, seq, type, sizeof(struct if_stats_msg), flags);

But if_nlmsg_stats_size() never considered the needed storage.

This bug did not show up because alloc_skb(X) allocates skb with
extra tailroom, because of added alignments. This could very well
be changed in the future to have deterministic behavior.
