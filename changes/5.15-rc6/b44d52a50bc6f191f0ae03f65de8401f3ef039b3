dsa: tag_dsa: Fix mask for trunked packets

A packet received on a trunk will have bit 2 set in Forward DSA tagged
frame. Bit 1 can be either 0 or 1 and is otherwise undefined and bit 0
indicates the frame CFI. Masking with 7 thus results in frames as
being identified as being from a trunk when in fact they are not. Fix
the mask to just look at bit 2.
