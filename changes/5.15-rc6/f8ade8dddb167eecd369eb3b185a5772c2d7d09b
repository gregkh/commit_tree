xsurf100: drop include of lib8390.c

Now that ax88796.c exports the ax_NS8390_reinit() symbol, we can
include 8390.h instead of lib8390.c, avoiding duplication of that
function and killing a few compile warnings in the bargain.

Fixes: 861928f4e60e826c ("net-next: New ax88796 platform
driver for Amiga X-Surf 100 Zorro board (m68k)")
