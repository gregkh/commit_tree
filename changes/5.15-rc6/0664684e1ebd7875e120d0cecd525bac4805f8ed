kbuild: Add -Werror=ignored-optimization-argument to CLANG_FLAGS

Similar to commit 589834b3a009 ("kbuild: Add
-Werror=unknown-warning-option to CLANG_FLAGS").

Clang ignores certain GCC flags that it has not implemented, only
emitting a warning:

$ echo | clang -fsyntax-only -falign-jumps -x c -
clang-14: warning: optimization flag '-falign-jumps' is not supported
[-Wignored-optimization-argument]

When one of these flags gets added to KBUILD_CFLAGS unconditionally, all
subsequent cc-{disable-warning,option} calls fail because -Werror was
added to these invocations to turn the above warning and the equivalent
-W flag warning into errors.

To catch the presence of these flags earlier, turn
-Wignored-optimization-argument into an error so that the flags can
either be implemented or ignored via cc-option and there are no more
weird errors.
