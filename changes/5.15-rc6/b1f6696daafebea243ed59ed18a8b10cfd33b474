lan78xx: Fix exception on link speed change

An exception is sometimes seen when the link speed is changed
from auto-negotiation to a fixed speed, or vice versa. The
exception occurs when the MAC is reset (due to the link speed
change) at the same time as the PHY state machine is accessing
a PHY register. The following changes fix this problem.

Rework the MAC reset to ensure there is no outstanding MDIO
register transaction before the reset and then wait until the
reset is complete before allowing any further MAC register access.
