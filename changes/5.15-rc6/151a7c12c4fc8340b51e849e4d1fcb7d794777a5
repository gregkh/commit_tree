Revert "brcmfmac: use ISO3166 country code and 0 rev as fallback"

This reverts commit b0b524f079a23e440dd22b04e369368dde847533.

Commit b0b524f079a2 ("brcmfmac: use ISO3166 country code and 0 rev
as fallback") changes country setup to directly use ISO3166 country
codes if no more specific code is configured. This was done under
the assumption that brcmfmac firmwares can handle such simple
direct mapping from country codes to firmware ccode values.

Unfortunately this is not true for all chipset/firmware combinations.
E.g. BCM4359/9 devices stop working as access point with this change,
so revert the offending commit to avoid the regression.
