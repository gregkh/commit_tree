KVM: x86: Kill off __ex() and __kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot()

Remove the __kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() and __ex() macros now that all
VMX and SVM instructions use asm goto to handle the fault (or in the
case of VMREAD, completely custom logic).  Drop kvm_spurious_fault()'s
asmlinkage annotation as __kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() was the only
flow that invoked it from assembly code.
