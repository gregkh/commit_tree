btrfs: deal with errors when replaying dir entry during log replay

At replay_one_one(), we are treating any error returned from
btrfs_lookup_dir_item() or from btrfs_lookup_dir_index_item() as meaning
that there is no existing directory entry in the fs/subvolume tree.
This is not correct since we can get errors such as, for example, -EIO
when reading extent buffers while searching the fs/subvolume's btree.

So fix that and return the error to the caller when it is not -ENOENT.
