fs/ntfs3: Remove deprecated mount options nls

Some discussion has been spoken that this deprecated mount options
should be removed before 5.15 lands. This driver is not never seen day
light so it was decided that nls mount option has to be removed. We have
always possibility to add this if needed.

One possible need is example if current ntfs driver will be taken out of
kernel and ntfs3 needs to support mount options what it has.
