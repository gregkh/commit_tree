ALSA: als100: Allocate resources with device-managed APIs

This patch converts the resource management in ISA als100 driver with
devres as a clean up.  Each manual resource management is converted
with the corresponding devres helper.  The remove callback became
superfluous and dropped.

This should give no user-visible functional changes.
