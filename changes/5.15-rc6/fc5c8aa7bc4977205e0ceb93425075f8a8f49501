libata: fix ata_read_log_page() warning

Support for the READ LOG PAGE DMA EXT command is indicated by words 119
and 120 of a device identify data. This is tested in
ata_read_log_page() with ata_id_has_read_log_dma_ext() and the
READ LOG PAGE DMA command used if the device reports supports for it.

However, some devices lie about this support and using the DMA version
of the command fails, generating the warning message "READ LOG DMA EXT
failed, trying PIO". Since READ LOG PAGE DMA EXT is an optional command,
this warning is not at all important but may be scary for the user.
Change ata_read_log_page() to suppres this warning and to print an
error message if both DMA and PIO attempts failed.

With this change, there is no need to print again an error message when
ata_read_log_page() returns an error. So simplify the users of this
function.
