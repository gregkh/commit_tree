ARM: 9113/1: uaccess: remove set_fs() implementation

There are no remaining callers of set_fs(), so just remove it
along with all associated code that operates on
thread_info->addr_limit.

There are still further optimizations that can be done:

- In get_user(), the address check could be moved entirely
  into the out of line code, rather than passing a constant
  as an argument,

- I assume the DACR handling can be simplified as we now
  only change it during user access when CONFIG_CPU_SW_DOMAIN_PAN
  is set, but not during set_fs().
