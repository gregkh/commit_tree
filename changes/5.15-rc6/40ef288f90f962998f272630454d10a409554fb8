drm/amd/display: add update authentication interface

[why]
Previously to toggle authentication, we need to remove and
add the same display back with modified adjustment.
This method will toggle DTM state without actual hardware changes.
This is not per design and would cause potential issues in the long run.

[how]
We are creating a dedicated interface that does the same thing as
remove and add back the display without changing DTM state.
