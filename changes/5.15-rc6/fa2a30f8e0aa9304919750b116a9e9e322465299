clk: renesas: rzg2l: Fix clk status function

As per RZ/G2L HW(Rev.0.50) manual, clock monitor register value
0 means clock is not supplied and 1 means clock is supplied.
This patch fixes the issue by removing the inverted logic.

Fixing the above, triggered following 2 issues

1) GIC interrupts don't work if we disable IA55_CLK and DMAC_ACLK.
   Fixed this issue by adding these clocks as critical clocks.

2) DMA is not working, since the DMA driver is not turning on DMAC_PCLK.
   So will provide a fix in the DMA driver to turn on DMA_PCLK.
