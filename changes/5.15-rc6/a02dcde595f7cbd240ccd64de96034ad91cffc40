Input: touchscreen - avoid bitwise vs logical OR warning

A new warning in clang points out a few places in this driver where a
bitwise OR is being used with boolean types:

drivers/input/touchscreen.c:81:17: warning: use of bitwise '|' with boolean operands [-Wbitwise-instead-of-logical]
        data_present = touchscreen_get_prop_u32(dev, "touchscreen-min-x",
                       ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This use of a bitwise OR is intentional, as bitwise operations do not
short circuit, which allows all the calls to touchscreen_get_prop_u32()
to happen so that the last parameter is initialized while coalescing the
results of the calls to make a decision after they are all evaluated.

To make this clearer to the compiler, use the '|=' operator to assign
the result of each touchscreen_get_prop_u32() call to data_present,
which keeps the meaning of the code the same but makes it obvious that
every one of these calls is expected to happen.
