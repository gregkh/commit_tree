arm64: kasan: mte: use a constant kernel GCR_EL1 value

When KASAN_HW_TAGS is selected, KASAN is enabled at boot time, and the
hardware supports MTE, we'll initialize `kernel_gcr_excl` with a value
dependent on KASAN_TAG_MAX. While the resulting value is a constant
which depends on KASAN_TAG_MAX, we have to perform some runtime work to
generate the value, and have to read the value from memory during the
exception entry path. It would be better if we could generate this as a
constant at compile-time, and use it as such directly.

Early in boot within __cpu_setup(), we initialize GCR_EL1 to a safe
value, and later override this with the value required by KASAN. If
CONFIG_KASAN_HW_TAGS is not selected, or if KASAN is disabeld at boot
time, the kernel will not use IRG instructions, and so the initial value
of GCR_EL1 is does not matter to the kernel. Thus, we can instead have
__cpu_setup() initialize GCR_EL1 to a value consistent with
KASAN_TAG_MAX, and avoid the need to re-initialize it during hotplug and
resume form suspend.

This patch makes arem64 use a compile-time constant KERNEL_GCR_EL1
value, which is compatible with KASAN_HW_TAGS when this is selected.
This removes the need to re-initialize GCR_EL1 dynamically, and acts as
an optimization to the entry assembly, which no longer needs to load
this value from memory. The redundant initialization hooks are removed.

In order to do this, KASAN_TAG_MAX needs to be visible outside of the
core KASAN code. To do this, I've moved the KASAN_TAG_* values into
<linux/kasan-tags.h>.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
