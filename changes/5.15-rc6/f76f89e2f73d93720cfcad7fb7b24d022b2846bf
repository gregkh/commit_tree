KVM: arm64: Refactor sys_regs.h,c for nVHE reuse

Refactor sys_regs.h and sys_regs.c to make it easier to reuse
common code. It will be used in nVHE in a later patch.

Note that the refactored code uses __inline_bsearch for find_reg
instead of bsearch to avoid copying the bsearch code for nVHE.

No functional change intended.
