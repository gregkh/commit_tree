cpuset: Cleanup cpuset_cpus_allowed_fallback() use in select_fallback_rq()

select_fallback_rq() only needs to recheck for an allowed CPU if the
affinity mask of the task has changed since the last check.

Return a 'bool' from cpuset_cpus_allowed_fallback() to indicate whether
the affinity mask was updated, and use this to elide the allowed check
when the mask has been left alone.

No functional change.
