e100: fix length calculation in e100_get_regs_len

commit abf9b902059f ("e100: cleanup unneeded math") tried to simplify
e100_get_regs_len and remove a double 'divide and then multiply'
calculation that the e100_reg_regs_len function did.

This change broke the size calculation entirely as it failed to account
for the fact that the numbered registers are actually 4 bytes wide and
not 1 byte. This resulted in a significant under allocation of the
register buffer used by e100_get_regs.

Fix this by properly multiplying the register count by u32 first before
adding the size of the dump buffer.
