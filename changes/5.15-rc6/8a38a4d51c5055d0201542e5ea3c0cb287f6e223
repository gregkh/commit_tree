mmc: meson-gx: do not use memcpy_to/fromio for dram-access-quirk

The memory at the end of the controller only accepts 32bit read/write
accesses, but the arm64 memcpy_to/fromio implementation only uses 64bit
(which will be split into two 32bit access) and 8bit leading to incomplete
copies to/from this memory when the buffer is not multiple of 8bytes.

Add a local copy using writel/readl accesses to make sure we use the right
memory access width.

The switch to memcpy_to/fromio was done because of 285133040e6c
("arm64: Import latest memcpy()/memmove() implementation"), but using memcpy
worked before since it mainly used 32bit memory acceses.
