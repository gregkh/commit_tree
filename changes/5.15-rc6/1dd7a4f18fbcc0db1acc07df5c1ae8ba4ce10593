KVM: VMX: Skip emulation required checks during pmode/rmode transitions

Don't refresh "emulation required" when stuffing segments during
transitions to/from real mode when running without unrestricted guest.
The checks are unnecessary as vmx_set_cr0() unconditionally rechecks
"emulation required".  They also happen to be broken, as enter_pmode()
and enter_rmode() run with a stale vcpu->arch.cr0.
