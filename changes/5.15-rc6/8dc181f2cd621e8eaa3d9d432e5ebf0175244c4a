net: ipa: don't hold clock reference while netdev open

Currently a clock reference is taken whenever the ->ndo_open
callback for the modem netdev is called.  That reference is dropped
when the device is closed, in ipa_stop().

We no longer need this, because ipa_start_xmit() now handles the
situation where the hardware power state is not active.

Drop the clock reference in ipa_open() when we're done, and take a
new reference in ipa_stop() before we begin closing the interface.

Finally (and unrelated, but trivial), change the return type of
ipa_start_xmit() to be netdev_tx_t instead of int.
