thunderbolt: build kunit tests without structleak plugin

The structleak plugin causes the stack frame size to grow immensely when
used with KUnit:

drivers/thunderbolt/test.c:1529:1: error: the frame size of 1176 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Werror=frame-larger-than=]

Turn it off in this file.

Linus already split up tests in this file, so this change *should* be
redundant now.
