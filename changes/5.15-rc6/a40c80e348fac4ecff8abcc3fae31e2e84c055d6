selftests: vm: add KSM unmerge test

Add check_ksm_unmerge() function to verify that KSM is properly unmerging
shared pages.  For this, two duplicate pages are merged first and then
their contents are modified.  Since they are not identical anymore, the
pages must be unmerged and the number of merged pages has to be 0.  The
test is run as follows: ./ksm_tests -U
