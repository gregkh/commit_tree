gpio/rockchip: extended debounce support is only available on v2

The gpio driver runs into issues on v1 gpio blocks, as the db_clk
and the whole extended debounce support is only ever defined on v2.
So checking for the IS_ERR on the db_clk is not enough, as it will
be NULL on v1.

Fix this by adding the needed condition for v2 first before checking
the existence of the db_clk.

This caused my rk3288-veyron-pinky to enter a reboot loop when it
tried to enable the power-key as adc-key device.
