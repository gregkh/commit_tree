arm64: dts: qcom: sc7180-trogdor: Fix lpass dai link for HDMI

This should be the dai for display port. Without this set properly we
fail to get audio routed through external displays on trogdor. It looks
like we picked up v4[1] of this patch when there was a v7[2]. The v7
patch still had the wrong sound-dai but at least we can fix all this up
and audio works.
