MAINTAINERS: rectify entry for SY8106A REGULATOR DRIVER

Commit b1c36aae51c9 ("regulator: Convert SY8106A binding to a schema")
converts sy8106a-regulator.txt to silergy,sy8106a.yaml, but missed to
adjust its reference in MAINTAINERS.

Hence, ./scripts/get_maintainer.pl --self-test=patterns complains about
a broken reference.

Repair this file reference in SY8106A REGULATOR DRIVER.
