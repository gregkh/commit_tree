drm/i915/dpcd_bl: Return early in vesa_calc_max_backlight if we can't read PWMGEN_BIT_COUNT

If we can't read DP_EDP_PWMGEN_BIT_COUNT in
intel_dp_aux_vesa_calc_max_backlight() but do have a valid PWM frequency
defined in the VBT, we'll keep going in the function until we inevitably
fail on reading DP_EDP_PWMGEN_BIT_COUNT_CAP_MIN. There's not much point in
doing this, so just return early.
