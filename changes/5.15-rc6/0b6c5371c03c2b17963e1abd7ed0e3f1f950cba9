perf tests attr: Add missing topdown metrics events

The Topdown metrics events were added as 'perf stat' default events
since commit 42641d6f4d15e6db ("perf stat: Add Topdown metrics events as
default events").

However, the perf attr tests were not updated
accordingly.

The perf attr test fails on the platform which supports Topdown metrics.

  # perf test 17

    17: Setup struct perf_event_attr        :FAILED!

Add Topdown metrics events into perf attr test cases. Make them optional
since they are only available on newer platforms.
