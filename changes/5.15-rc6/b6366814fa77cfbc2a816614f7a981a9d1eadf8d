drm/tilcdc: Convert to Linux IRQ interfaces

Drop the DRM IRQ midlayer in favor of Linux IRQ interfaces. DRM's
IRQ helpers are mostly useful for UMS drivers. Modern KMS drivers
don't benefit from using it.

DRM IRQ callbacks are now being called directly or inlined.

Calls to platform_get_irq() can fail with a negative errno code.
Abort initialization in this case. The DRM IRQ midlayer does not
handle this case correctly.

For most drivers, only the DRM IRQ helpers use irq_enabled from
struct drm_device. Tilcdc also uses irq_enabled to make its error
rollback work correctly. As the field will become legacy, duplicated
the state in the driver's local private structure.
