tcp: enable mid stream window clamp

The TCP_WINDOW_CLAMP socket option is defined in tcp(7) to "Bound the size
of the advertised window to this value."  Window clamping is distributed
across two variables, window_clamp ("Maximal window to advertise" in
tcp.h) and rcv_ssthresh ("Current window clamp").

This patch updates the function where the window clamp is set to also
reduce the current window clamp, rcv_sshthresh, if needed.  With this,
setting the TCP_WINDOW_CLAMP option has the documented effect of limiting
the window.
