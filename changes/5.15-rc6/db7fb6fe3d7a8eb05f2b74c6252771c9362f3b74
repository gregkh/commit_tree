ksmbd: remove setattr preparations in set_file_basic_info()

Permission checking and copying over ownership information is the task
of the underlying filesystem not ksmbd. The order is also wrong here.
This modifies the inode before notify_change(). If notify_change() fails
this will have changed ownership nonetheless. All of this is unnecessary
though since the underlying filesystem's ->setattr handler will do all
this (if required) by itself.
