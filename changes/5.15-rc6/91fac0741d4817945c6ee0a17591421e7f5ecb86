USB: cdc-acm: fix minor-number release

If the driver runs out of minor numbers it would release minor 0 and
allow another device to claim the minor while still in use.

Fortunately, registering the tty class device of the second device would
fail (with a stack dump) due to the sysfs name collision so no memory is
leaked.
