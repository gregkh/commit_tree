arm64: entry: Add SYM_CODE annotation for __bad_stack

When converting arm64 to modern assembler annotations __bad_stack was left
as a raw local label without annotations. While this will have little if
any practical impact at present it may cause issues in the future if we
start using the annotations for things like reliable stack trace. Add
SYM_CODE annotations to fix this.
