xfs: convert xfs_sb_version_has checks to use mount features

This is a conversion of the remaining xfs_sb_version_has..(sbp)
checks to use xfs_has_..(mp) feature checks.

This was largely done with a vim replacement macro that did:

:0,$s/xfs_sb_version_has\(.*\)&\(.*\)->m_sb/xfs_has_\1\2/g<CR>

A couple of other variants were also used, and the rest touched up
by hand.

$ size -t fs/xfs/built-in.a
	   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
before	1127533  311352     484 1439369  15f689 (TOTALS)
after	1125360  311352     484 1437196  15ee0c (TOTALS)
