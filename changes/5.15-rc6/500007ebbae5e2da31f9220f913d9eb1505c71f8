drm/mediatek: Implement mmap as GEM object function

Moving the driver-specific mmap code into a GEM object function allows
for using DRM helpers for various mmap callbacks.

The respective mediatek functions are being removed. The file_operations
structure fops is now being created by the helper macro
DEFINE_DRM_GEM_FOPS().
