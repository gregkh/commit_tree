cb710: avoid NULL pointer subtraction

clang-14 complains about an unusual way of converting a pointer to
an integer:

drivers/misc/cb710/sgbuf2.c:50:15: error: performing pointer subtraction with a null pointer has undefined behavior [-Werror,-Wnull-pointer-subtraction]
        return ((ptr - NULL) & 3) != 0;

Replace this with a normal cast to uintptr_t.
