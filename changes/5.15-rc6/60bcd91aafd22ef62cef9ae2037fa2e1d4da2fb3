watchdog: introduce watchdog_dev_suspend/resume

The watchdog drivers often disable wdog clock during suspend and then
enable it again during resume. Nevertheless the ping worker is still
running and can issue low-level ping while the wdog clock is disabled
causing the system hang. To prevent such condition register pm notifier
in the watchdog core which will call watchdog_dev_suspend/resume and
actually cancel ping worker during suspend and restore it back, if
needed, during resume.
