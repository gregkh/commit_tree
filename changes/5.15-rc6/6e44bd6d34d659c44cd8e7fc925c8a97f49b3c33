memblock: exclude NOMAP regions from kmemleak

Vladimir Zapolskiy reports:

commit a7259df76702 ("memblock: make memblock_find_in_range method private")
invokes a kernel panic while running kmemleak on OF platforms with nomaped
regions:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request at virtual address fff000021e00000
  [...]
    scan_block+0x64/0x170
    scan_gray_list+0xe8/0x17c
    kmemleak_scan+0x270/0x514
    kmemleak_write+0x34c/0x4ac

Indeed, NOMAP regions don't have linear map entries so an attempt to scan
these areas would fault.

Prevent such faults by excluding NOMAP regions from kmemleak.
