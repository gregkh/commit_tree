memblock: Check memory add/cap ordering

For memblock_cap_memory_range() to work properly, it should be called
after memory is detected and added to memblock with memblock_add() or
memblock_add_node().  If memblock_cap_memory_range() would be called
before memory is registered, we may silently corrupt memory later
because the crash kernel will see all memory as available.

Print a warning and bail out if ordering is not satisfied.
