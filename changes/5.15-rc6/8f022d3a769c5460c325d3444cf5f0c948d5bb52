selftests/ftrace: Add selftest for testing eprobe events on synthetic events

Add a test to test event probes, by creating a synthetic event across
sys_enter_openat and sys_exit_openat that passes the filename pointer from
the enter of the system call to the exit, and then add an event probe to
the synthetic event to make sure that the file name is seen.
