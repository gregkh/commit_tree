arm: dts: vexpress: Fix motherboard bus 'interrupt-map'

Commit 078fb7aa6a83 ("arm: dts: vexpress: Fix addressing issues with
'motherboard-bus' nodes") broke booting on a couple of 32-bit VExpress
boards. The problem is #address-cells size changed, but interrupt-map
was not updated. This results in the timer interrupt (and all the
other motherboard interrupts) not getting mapped.

As the 'interrupt-map' properties are all just duplicates across boards,
just move them into vexpress-v2m.dtsi and vexpress-v2m-rs1.dtsi.
Strictly speaking, 'interrupt-map' is dependent on the parent
interrupt controller, but it's not likely we'll ever have a different
parent than GICv2 on these old platforms. If there was one,
'interrupt-map' can still be overridden.
