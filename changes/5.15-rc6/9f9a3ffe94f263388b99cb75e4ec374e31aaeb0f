perf bench futex: Add --mlockall parameter

This adds, across all futex benchmarks, the -m/--mlockall option
which is a common operation for realtime workloads by not incurring
in page faults in paths that want determinism. As such, threads
started after a call to mlockall(2) will generate page faults
immediately since the new stack is immediately forced to memory,
due to the MCL_FUTURE flag.
