drm/i915/bdb: Fix version check

With patch "drm/i915/vbt: Fix backlight parsing for VBT 234+"
the size of bdb_lfp_backlight_data structure has been increased,
causing if-statement in the parse_lfp_backlight function
that comapres this structure size to the one retrieved from BDB,
always to fail for older revisions.
This patch calculates expected size of the structure for a given
BDB version and compares it with the value gathered from BDB.
Tested on Chromebook Pixelbook (Nocturne) (reports bdb->version = 221)
