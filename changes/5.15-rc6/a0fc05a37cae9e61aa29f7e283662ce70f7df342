Doc/fs/ntfs3: Fix rst format and make it cleaner

Current ntfs3 rst documentation is broken. I turn table to list table as
this is current Linux documentation quide line. Simple table also did
not quite work in our situation as we need to span rows together.

It still look quite good as text so we did not loss anything. This will
also make diffing quite bit more pleasure.
