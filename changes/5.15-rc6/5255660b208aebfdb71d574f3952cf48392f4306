xhci: add quirk for host controllers that don't update endpoint DCS

Seen on a VLI VL805 PCIe to USB controller. For non-stream endpoints
at least, if the xHC halts on a particular TRB due to an error then
the DCS field in the Out Endpoint Context maintained by the hardware
is not updated with the current cycle state.

Using the quirk XHCI_EP_CTX_BROKEN_DCS and instead fetch the DCS bit
from the TRB that the xHC stopped on.

[ bjorn: rebased to v5.14-rc2 ]
