arm: dts: vexpress: Drop unused properties from motherboard node

Drop the '#interrupt-cells' property in the motherboard node which has no
effect as the node is neither an interrupt-controller or interrupt-map
(that's in the parent node).

Drop 'model' as it is not used by software nor documented.

Drop 'arm,v2m-memory-map' as it is not used by software. The purpose was
to describe which memory map, but that's all described by the DT
already.
