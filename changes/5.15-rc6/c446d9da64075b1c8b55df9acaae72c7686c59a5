RDMA/mlx5: Add shared FDB support

Shared FDB allows to create a single RDMA device that holds representors
from both eswitches. As shared FDB is only active when both uplink
representors are enslaved there is a single RDMA port that represents
both uplinks.

The number of ports is the number of vports on both eswitches minus one
as we only need 1 port for both uplinks.
