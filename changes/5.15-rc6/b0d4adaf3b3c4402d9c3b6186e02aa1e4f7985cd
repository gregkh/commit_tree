fat: Add KUnit tests for checksums and timestamps

Add some basic sanity-check tests for the fat_checksum() function and
the fat_time_unix2fat() and fat_time_fat2unix() functions. These unit
tests verify these functions return correct output for a number of test
inputs.

These tests were inspired by -- and serve a similar purpose to -- the
timestamp parsing KUnit tests in ext4[1].

Note that, unlike fat_time_unix2fat, fat_time_fat2unix wasn't previously
exported, so this patch exports it as well. This is required for the
case where we're building the fat and fat_test as modules.
