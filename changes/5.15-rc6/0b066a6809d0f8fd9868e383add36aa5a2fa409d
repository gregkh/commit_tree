drm: vc4: Fix pixel-wrap issue with DVP teardown

Adjust the DVP enable/disable sequence to avoid a pixel getting stuck
in an internal, non resettable FIFO within PixelValve when changing
HDMI resolution.

The blank pixels features of the DVP can prevent signals back to
pixelvalve causing it to not clear the FIFO. Adjust the ordering
and timing of operations to ensure the clear signal makes it through to
pixelvalve.
