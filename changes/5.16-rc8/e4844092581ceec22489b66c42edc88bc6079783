xhci: Fresco FL1100 controller should not have BROKEN_MSI quirk set.

The Fresco Logic FL1100 controller needs the TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk like
other Fresco controllers, but should not have the BROKEN_MSI quirks set.

BROKEN_MSI quirk causes issues in detecting usb drives connected to docks
with this FL1100 controller.
The BROKEN_MSI flag was apparently accidentally set together with the
TRUST_TX_LENGTH quirk

Original patch went to stable so this should go there as well.
