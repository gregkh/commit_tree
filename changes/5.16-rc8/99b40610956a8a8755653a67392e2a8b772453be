net: bridge: mcast: add and enforce query interval minimum

As reported[1] if query interval is set too low and we have multiple
bridges or even a single bridge with multiple querier vlans configured
we can crash the machine. Add a 1 second minimum which must be enforced
by overwriting the value if set lower (i.e. without returning an error) to
avoid breaking user-space. If that happens a log message is emitted to let
the administrator know that the interval has been set to the minimum.
The issue has been present since these intervals could be user-controlled.
