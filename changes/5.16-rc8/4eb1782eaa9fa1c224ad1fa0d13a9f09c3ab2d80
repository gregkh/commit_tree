recordmcount.pl: fix typo in s390 mcount regex

Commit 85bf17b28f97 ("recordmcount.pl: look for jgnop instruction as well
as bcrl on s390") added a new alternative mnemonic for the existing brcl
instruction. This is required for the combination old gcc version (pre 9.0)
and binutils since version 2.37.
However at the same time this commit introduced a typo, replacing brcl with
bcrl. As a result no mcount locations are detected anymore with old gcc
versions (pre 9.0) and binutils before version 2.37.
Fix this by using the correct mnemonic again.
