drm/amd/display: Changed pipe split policy to allow for multi-display pipe split

[WHY]
Current implementation of pipe split policy prevents pipe split with
multiple displays connected, which caused the MCLK speed to be stuck at
max

[HOW]
Changed the pipe split policies so that pipe split is allowed for
multi-display configurations
