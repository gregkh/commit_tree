auxdisplay: charlcd: checking for pointer reference before dereferencing

Check if the pointer lcd->ops->init_display exists before dereferencing it.
If a driver called charlcd_init() without defining the ops, this would
return segmentation fault, as happened to me when implementing a charlcd
driver.  Checking the pointer before dereferencing protects from
segmentation fault.
