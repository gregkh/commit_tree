Input: spaceball - fix parsing of movement data packets

The spaceball.c module was not properly parsing the movement reports
coming from the device.  The code read axis data as signed 16-bit
little-endian values starting at offset 2.

In fact, axis data in Spaceball movement reports are signed 16-bit
big-endian values starting at offset 3.  This was determined first by
visually inspecting the data packets, and later verified by consulting:

If this ever worked properly, it was in the time before Git...
