net: bridge: mcast: add and enforce startup query interval minimum

As reported[1] if startup query interval is set too low in combination with
large number of startup queries and we have multiple bridges or even a
single bridge with multiple querier vlans configured we can crash the
machine. Add a 1 second minimum which must be enforced by overwriting the
value if set lower (i.e. without returning an error) to avoid breaking
user-space. If that happens a log message is emitted to let the admin know
that the startup interval has been set to the minimum. It doesn't make
sense to make the startup interval lower than the normal query interval
so use the same value of 1 second. The issue has been present since these
intervals could be user-controlled.
