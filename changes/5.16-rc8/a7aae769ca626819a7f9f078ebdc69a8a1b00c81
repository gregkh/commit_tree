usb: mtu3: add memory barrier before set GPD's HWO

There is a seldom issue that the controller access invalid address
and trigger devapc or emimpu violation. That is due to memory access
is out of order and cause gpd data is not correct.
Add mb() to prohibit compiler or cpu from reordering to make sure GPD
is fully written before setting its HWO.
