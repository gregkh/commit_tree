net/smc: fix using of uninitialized completions

In smc_wr_tx_send_wait() the completion on index specified by
pend->idx is initialized and after smc_wr_tx_send() was called the wait
for completion starts. pend->idx is used to get the correct index for
the wait, but the pend structure could already be cleared in
smc_wr_tx_process_cqe().
Introduce pnd_idx to hold and use a local copy of the correct index.
