ASoC: ac97: Drop support for setting platform data via the CPU DAI

This has no users since commit f0fba2ad1b6b ("ASoC: multi-component - ASoC
Multi-Component Support") which was almost 5 years ago. Given that this runs
after CODEC probe functions have been run it also doesn't seem to be that
useful.

So drop it altogether to make the code simpler.
