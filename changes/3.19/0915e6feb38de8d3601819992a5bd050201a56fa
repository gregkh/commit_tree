gpio: sysfs: fix gpio device-attribute leak

The gpio device attributes were never destroyed when the gpio was
unexported (or on export failures).

Use device_create_with_groups() to create the default device attributes
of the gpio class device. Note that this also fixes the
attribute-creation race with userspace for these attributes.

Remove contingent attributes in export error path and on unexport.
