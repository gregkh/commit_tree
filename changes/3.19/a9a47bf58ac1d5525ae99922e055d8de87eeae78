scsi: repurpose the last argument from print_opcode_name()

print_opcode_name() was only ever called with a '0' argument
from LLDDs and ULDs which were _not_ supporting variable length
CDBs, so the 'if' clause was never triggered.
Instead we should be using the last argument to specify
the cdb length to avoid accidental overflow when reading
the cdb buffer.
