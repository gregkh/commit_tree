MIPS: cpu: Add 'noftlb' kernel command line option to disable the FTLB

Add new 'noftlb' kernel command line option to disable the FTLB.
Since the kernel command line is not available when probing and
enabling the CPU features in cpu_probe(), we let the kernel configure
the FTLB during the config4 decode operation and we disable the FTLB later
on, once the command line has become available to us. This should have
no negative effects since FTLB isn't used so early in the boot process.
FTLB increases the effective TLB size leading to less TLB misses. However,
sometimes it's useful to be able to disable it when debugging memory related
core features or other hardware components.
