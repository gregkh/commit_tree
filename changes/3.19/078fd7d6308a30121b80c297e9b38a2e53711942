uas: Do not blacklist ASM1153 disk enclosures

Our detection logic to avoid doing UAS on ASM1051 bridge chips causes problems
with newer ASM1153 disk enclosures in 2 ways:

1) Some ASM1153 disk enclosures re-use the ASM1051 device-id of 5106, which
   we assume is always an ASM1051, so remove the quirk for 5106, and instead
   use the same detection logic as we already use for device-id 55aa, which is
   used for all of ASM1051, ASM1053 and ASM1153 devices <sigh>.

2) Our detection logic to differentiate between ASM1051 and ASM1053 sees
   ASM1153 devices as ASM1051 because they have 32 streams like ASM1051 devs.
   Luckily the ASM1153 descriptors are not 100% identical, unlike the previous
   models the ASM1153 has bMaxPower == 0, so use that to differentiate it.
