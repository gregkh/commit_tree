x86_64,vsyscall: Make vsyscall emulation configurable

This adds CONFIG_X86_VSYSCALL_EMULATION, guarded by CONFIG_EXPERT.
Turning it off completely disables vsyscall emulation, saving ~3.5k
for vsyscall_64.c, 4k for vsyscall_emu_64.S (the fake vsyscall
page), some tiny amount of core mm code that supports a gate area,
and possibly 4k for a wasted pagetable.  The latter is because the
vsyscall addresses are misaligned and fit poorly in the fixmap.
