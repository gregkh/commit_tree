arm64: sanity checks: add missing AArch32 registers

We don't currently check a number of registers exposed to AArch32 guests
(MVFR{0,1,2}_EL1 and ID_DFR0_EL1), despite the fact these describe
AArch32 feature support exposed to userspace and KVM guests similarly to
AArch64 registers which we do check. We do not expect these registers to
vary across a set of CPUs.

This patch adds said registers to the cpuinfo framework and sanity
checks. No sanity check failures have been observed on a current ARMv8
big.LITTLE platform (Juno).
