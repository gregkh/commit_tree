tracing: Move tracing_sched_{switch,wakeup}() into wakeup tracer

The only code that references tracing_sched_switch_trace() and
tracing_sched_wakeup_trace() is the wakeup latency tracer. Those
two functions use to belong to the sched_switch tracer which has
long been removed. These functions were left behind because the
wakeup latency tracer used them. But since the wakeup latency tracer
is the only one to use them, they should be static functions inside
that code.
