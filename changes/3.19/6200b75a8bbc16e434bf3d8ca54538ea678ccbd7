ASoC: cq93vc: Cleanup manual bias level transitions

Remove the manual transition back to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in resume. This
is already be automatically handled by the ASoC core.

Since the ASoC core now takes care of setting the bias level to
SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF when removing the CODEC there is no need to do it manually
anymore either.

The manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY at the end of CODEC probe()
can also be removed as the core will automatically do this after the CODEC
has been probed. While we are at it also remove the unused codec field from
the cq93vc struct so the whole probe function can be removed.
