Btrfs: ensure send always works on roots without orphans

Move the logic from the snapshot creation ioctl into send. This avoids
doing the transaction commit if send isn't used, and ensures that if
a crash/reboot happens after the transaction commit that created the
snapshot and before the transaction commit that switched the commit
root, send will not get a commit root that differs from the main root
(that has orphan items).
