Revert "IPoIB: Make the carrier_on_task race aware"

This reverts commit 67d7209e1f481cbaed37f9a224a328a3f83d0482.

The series of IPoIB bug fixes that went into 3.19-rc1 introduce
regressions, and after trying to sort things out, we decided to revert
to 3.18's IPoIB driver and get things right for 3.20.
