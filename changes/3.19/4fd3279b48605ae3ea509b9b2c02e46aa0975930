ftrace: Add more information to ftrace_bug() output

With the introduction of the dynamic trampolines, it is useful that if
things go wrong that ftrace_bug() produces more information about what
the current state is. This can help debug issues that may arise.

Ftrace has lots of checks to make sure that the state of the system it
touchs is exactly what it expects it to be. When it detects an abnormality
it calls ftrace_bug() and disables itself to prevent any further damage.
It is crucial that ftrace_bug() produces sufficient information that
can be used to debug the situation.
