leds: implement sysfs interface locking mechanism

Add a mechanism for locking LED subsystem sysfs interface.
This patch prepares ground for addition of LED Flash Class
extension, whose API will be integrated with V4L2 Flash API.
Such a fusion enforces introducing a locking scheme, which
will secure consistent access to the LED Flash Class device.

The mechanism being introduced allows for disabling LED
subsystem sysfs interface by calling led_sysfs_disable function
and enabling it by calling led_sysfs_enable. The functions
alter the LED_SYSFS_DISABLE flag state and must be called
under mutex lock. The state of the lock is checked with use
of led_sysfs_is_disabled function. Such a design allows for
providing immediate feedback to the user space on whether
the LED Flash Class device is available or is under V4L2 Flash
sub-device control.
