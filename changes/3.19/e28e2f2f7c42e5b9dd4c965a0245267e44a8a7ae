uas: Make uas work with blk-mq

With uas over usb-3 the tags inside the uas iu-s must match the usb-3 stream
ids, and those go from 1 - qdepth.

Before blk-mq calling scsi_activate_tcq(sdev, qdepth) guaranteed that we would
only get cmnd->request->tag from 0 - (qdepth - 1), and we used those as
uas-tags / stream-ids.

With blk-mq however we are guaranteed to never get more then qdepth commands
queued at the same time, but the cmnd->request->tag values may be much larger,
which breaks uas.

This commit fixes this by generating uas tags in the 1 - qdepth range ourselves
instead of using cmnd->request->tag.

While touching all involved code anyways also rename the uas_cmd_info stream
field to uas_tag, because when using uas over usb-2 streams are not used.
