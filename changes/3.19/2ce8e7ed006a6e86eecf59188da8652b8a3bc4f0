dma-debug: prevent early callers from crashing

dma_debug_init() is called by architecture specific code at different
levels, but typically as a fs_initcall due to the debugfs initialization.
Some platforms may have early callers of the DMA-API, running prior to the
fs_initcall() level, which is not much of an issue unless
CONFIG_DMA_API_DEBUG is set.  When the DMA-API debugging facilities are
turned on a caller will go through:

debug_dma_map_{single,page}
  -> dma_mapping_error (inline function usually)
    -> debug_dma_mapping_error
      -> get_hash_bucket

Calling get_hash_bucket() returns a valid hash value since we hash on high
bits of the dma_addr cookie, but we will grab an unitialized spinlock,
which typically won't crash but produce a warning, the real crash will
however happen during the bucket list traversal because the list has not
been initialized yet.

An obvious solution is of course to move some of the offenders to run
after the fs_initcall level, but since this might not always be an option,
we add a flag "dma_debug_initialized" which is set to false by default,
and set to true once dma_debug_init() has had a chance to run.

The dma_debug_disabled() helper function previously introduced just needs
to check for dma_debug_initialized to allow the caller to proceed or not.
