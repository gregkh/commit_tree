x86, mpx: Add MPX-specific mmap interface

We have chosen to perform the allocation of bounds tables in
kernel (See the patch "on-demand kernel allocation of bounds
tables") and to mark these VMAs with VM_MPX.

However, there is currently no suitable interface to actually do
this.  Existing interfaces, like do_mmap_pgoff(), have no way to
set a modified ->vm_ops or ->vm_flags and don't hold mmap_sem
long enough to let a caller do it.

This patch wraps mmap_region() and hold mmap_sem long enough to
make the modifications to the VMA which we need.

Also note the 32/64-bit #ifdef in the header.  We actually need
to do this at runtime eventually.  But, for now, we don't support
running 32-bit binaries on 64-bit kernels.  Support for this will
come in later patches.
