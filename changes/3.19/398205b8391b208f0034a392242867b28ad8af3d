blk_mq: call preempt_disable/enable in blk_mq_run_hw_queue, and only if needed

preempt_disable/enable surrounds every call to blk_mq_run_hw_queue,
except the one in blk-flush.c.  In fact that one is always asynchronous,
and it does not need smp_processor_id().

We can do the same for all other calls, avoiding preempt_disable when
async is true.  This avoids peppering blk-mq.c with preemption-disabled
regions.
