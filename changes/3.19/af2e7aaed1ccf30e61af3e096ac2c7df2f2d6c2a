arm64/spinlock: Replace ACCESS_ONCE READ_ONCE

ACCESS_ONCE does not work reliably on non-scalar types. For
example gcc 4.6 and 4.7 might remove the volatile tag for such
accesses during the SRA (scalar replacement of aggregates) step
(https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58145)

Change the spinlock code to replace ACCESS_ONCE with READ_ONCE.
