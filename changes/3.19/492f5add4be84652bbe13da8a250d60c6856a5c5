net/mlx4_en: Doorbell is byteswapped in Little Endian archs

iowrite32() will byteswap it's argument on big endian archs.
iowrite32be() will byteswap on little endian archs.
Since we don't want to do this unnecessary byteswap on the fast path,
doorbell is stored in the NIC's native endianness. Using the right
iowrite() according to the arch endianness.
