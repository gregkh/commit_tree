tcp: fix stretch ACK bugs in CUBIC

Change CUBIC to properly handle stretch ACKs in additive increase mode
by passing in the count of ACKed packets to tcp_cong_avoid_ai().

In addition, because we are now precisely accounting for stretch ACKs,
including delayed ACKs, we can now remove the delayed ACK tracking and
estimation code that tracked recent delayed ACK behavior in
ca->delayed_ack.
