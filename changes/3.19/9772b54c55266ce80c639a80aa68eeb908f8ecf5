net: sctp: use MAX_HEADER for headroom reserve in output path

To accomodate for enough headroom for tunnels, use MAX_HEADER instead
of LL_MAX_HEADER. Robert reported that he has hit after roughly 40hrs
of trinity an skb_under_panic() via SCTP output path (see reference).
I couldn't reproduce it from here, but not using MAX_HEADER as elsewhere
in other protocols might be one possible cause for this.

In any case, it looks like accounting on chunks themself seems to look
good as the skb already passed the SCTP output path and did not hit
any skb_over_panic(). Given tunneling was enabled in his .config, the
headroom would have been expanded by MAX_HEADER in this case.
