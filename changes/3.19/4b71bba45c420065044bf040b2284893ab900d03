Bluetooth: Enabled LE Direct Advertising Report event if supported

When the controller supports the Extended Scanner Filter Policies, it
supports the LE Direct Advertising Report event. However by default
that event is blocked by the LE event mask. It is required to enable
it during controller setup.
