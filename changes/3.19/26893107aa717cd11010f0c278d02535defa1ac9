x86_64/vsyscall: Restore orig_ax after vsyscall seccomp

The vsyscall emulation code sets orig_ax for seccomp's benefit,
but it forgot to set it back.

I'm not sure that this is observable at all, but it could cause
confusion to various /proc or ptrace users, and it's possible
that it could cause minor artifacts if a signal were to be
delivered on return from vsyscall emulation.
