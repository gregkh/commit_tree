USB: qcserial/option: make AT URCs work for Sierra Wireless MC73xx

As has been discussed in the thread starting with
https://lkml.kernel.org/g/549748e9.d+SiJzqu50f1r4lSAL043YSc@arcor.de
Sierra Wireless MC73xx devices with USB VID/PID 0x1199:0x68c0 require the
option_send_setup() code to be used on the USB interface for the AT port
to make unsolicited response codes work correctly. Move these devices from
the qcserial driver where they have been added by commit
70a3615fc07c2330ed7c1e922f3c44f4a67c0762 ("usb: qcserial: add Sierra Wireless
MC73xx") to the option driver and add a MC73xx-specific blacklist
to ensure that
1. the sendsetup code is not used for the DIAG/DM and NMEA interfaces
2. the option driver does not attach to the QMI/network interfaces
