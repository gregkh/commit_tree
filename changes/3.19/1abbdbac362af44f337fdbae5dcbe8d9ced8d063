irqchip: brcmstb-l2: Convert driver to use irq_reg_{readl,writel}

This effectively converts the __raw_ accessors to the non-__raw_
equivalents.  To handle BE, we pass IRQ_GC_BE_IO, similar to what was
done in irq-bcm7120-l2.c.

Since irq_reg_writel now takes an irq_chip_generic argument, writel must
be used for the initial hardware reset in the probe function.  But that
operation never needs endian swapping, so it's probably not a big deal.
