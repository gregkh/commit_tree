staging: comedi: adv_pci1724: use subdevice readback for 'gain_value'

Use the comedi_subdevice 'readback' member and the core provided (*insn_read)
to handle the readback of the write-only gain calib subdevice. Remove the
then unused 'gain_value' member from the private data.

The private data is now unnecessary. Remove it and the allocation.
