clk: rockchip: ensure HCLK_VIO2_H2P and PCLK_VIO2_H2P stay enabled

Currently there is no driver owning these clocks and they have to stay
up for the system to function properly, so let's mark them as
CLK_IGNORE_UNUSED.

Without this patch we have trouble with suspend/resume and we have
trouble turning the eDP back on if it ever idles off.
