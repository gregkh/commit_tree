igbvf: Fix checksum error when using stacked vlan

When a skb has multiple vlans and it is CHECKSUM_PARTIAL,
igbvf_tx_csum() fails to get the network protocol and checksum related
descriptor fields are not configured correctly because skb->protocol
doesn't show the L3 protocol in this case.

Use vlan_get_protocol() to get the proper network protocol.
