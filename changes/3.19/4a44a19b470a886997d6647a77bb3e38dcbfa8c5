mnt: Update unprivileged remount test

- MNT_NODEV should be irrelevant except when reading back mount flags,
  no longer specify MNT_NODEV on remount.

- Test MNT_NODEV on devpts where it is meaningful even for unprivileged mounts.

- Add a test to verify that remount of a prexisting mount with the same flags
  is allowed and does not change those flags.

- Cleanup up the definitions of MS_REC, MS_RELATIME, MS_STRICTATIME that are used
  when the code is built in an environment without them.

- Correct the test error messages when tests fail.  There were not 5 tests
  that tested MS_RELATIME.
