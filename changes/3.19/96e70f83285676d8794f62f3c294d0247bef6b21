x86/mm: Avoid overlap the fixmap area on i386

It is a problem when configuring high memory off where the
vmalloc reserve area could end up overlapping the early_ioremap
fixmap area on i386.

The ordering of the VMALLOC_RESERVE space is:

 FIXADDR_TOP
                       fixed_addresses
 FIXADDR_START
                       early_ioremap fixed addresses
 FIXADDR_BOOT_START
                       Persistent kmap area
 PKMAP_BASE
 VMALLOC_END
                       Vmalloc area
 VMALLOC_START
 high_memory

The available address we can use is lower than
FIXADDR_BOOT_START. So we will set the kmap boundary below the
FIXADDR_BOOT_START, if we configure high memory.

If we configure high memory, the vmalloc reserve area should
end up to PKMAP_BASE, otherwise should end up to
FIXADDR_BOOT_START.
