dm bufio: fix memleak when using a dm_buffer's inline bio

When dm-bufio sets out to use the bio built into a struct dm_buffer to
issue an IO, it needs to call bio_reset after it's done with the bio
so that we can free things attached to the bio such as the integrity
payload.  Therefore, inject our own endio callback to take care of
the bio_reset after calling submit_io's end_io callback.

Test case:
1. modprobe scsi_debug delay=0 dif=1 dix=199 ato=1 dev_size_mb=300
2. Set up a dm-bufio client, e.g. dm-verity, on the scsi_debug device
3. Repeatedly read metadata and watch kmalloc-192 leak!
