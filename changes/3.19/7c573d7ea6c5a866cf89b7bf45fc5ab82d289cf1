serial: mxs-auart: use mctrl_gpio helpers for handling modem signals

Dedicated CTS and RTS pins are unusable together with a lot of other
peripherals because they share the same line. Pinctrl is limited.

Moreover, the AUART controller doesn't handle DTR/DSR/DCD/RI signals,
so we have to control them via GPIO.

This patch permits to use GPIOs to control the CTS/RTS/DTR/DSR/DCD/RI
signals.
