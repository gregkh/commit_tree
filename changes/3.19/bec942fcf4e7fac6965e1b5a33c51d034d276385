arm: pxa: remove unnecessary includes from pxa-dt

As the init functions necessary for machine init have moved to
generic.h, remove the unnecessary includes and prototypes definitions
from pxa-dt.c.

This removes the include of mach/pxaXXX-regs.h, and make pxa-dt generic
enough to accept other pxa variants.
