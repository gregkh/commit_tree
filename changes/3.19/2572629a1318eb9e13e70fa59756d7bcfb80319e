dm cache: fix some issues with the new discard range support

Commit 7ae34e777 ("dm cache: improve discard support") needed to also:
- discontinue having DM core split the discard bios on cache block
  boundaries
- calculate the cache's discard_nr_blocks relative to the determined
  discard_block_size rather than using oblock_to_dblock()
