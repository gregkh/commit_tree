perf report: Add --branch-history option

Add a --branch-history option to perf report that changes all the
settings necessary for using the branches in callstacks.

This is just a short cut to make this nicer to use, it does not enable
any functionality by itself.

v2: Change sort order. Rename option to --branch-history to
    be less confusing.
v3: Updates
v4: Fix conflict with newer perf base
v5: Port to latest tip
v6: Add more comments. Remove CCKEY_ADDRESS setting. Remove
    unnecessary branch_mode setting. Use a boolean.
