ARM: 8199/1: PM / Runtime: Add getter for querying the IRQ safe option v12

Add a simple getter pm_runtime_is_irq_safe() for querying whether runtime
PM IRQ safe was set or not.

Various bus drivers implementing runtime PM may use choose to suspend
differently based on IRQ safeness status of child driver (e.g. do not
unprepare the clock if IRQ safe is not set).
