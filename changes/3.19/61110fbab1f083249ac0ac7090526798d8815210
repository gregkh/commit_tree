[media] ti-fpe: LLVMLinux: Remove nested function from ti-vpe

Replace the use of nested functions where a normal function will suffice.

Nested functions are not liked by upstream kernel developers in general. Their
use breaks the use of clang as a compiler, and doesn't make the code any
better.

This code now works for both gcc and clang.
