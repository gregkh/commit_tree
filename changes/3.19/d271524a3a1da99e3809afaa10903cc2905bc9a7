iov_iter.c: get rid of bvec_copy_page_{to,from}_iter()

Just have copy_page_{to,from}_iter() fall back to kmap_atomic +
copy_{to,from}_iter() + kunmap_atomic() in ITER_BVEC case.  As
the matter of fact, that's what we want to do for any iov_iter
kind that isn't blocking - e.g. ITER_KVEC will also go that way
once we recognize it on iov_iter.c primitives level
