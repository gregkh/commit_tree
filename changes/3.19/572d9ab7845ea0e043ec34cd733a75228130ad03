btrfs: add support for processing pending changes

There are some actions that modify global filesystem state but cannot be
performed at the time of request, but later at the transaction commit
time when the filesystem is in a known state.

For example enabling new incompat features on-the-fly or issuing
transaction commit from unsafe contexts (sysfs handlers).
