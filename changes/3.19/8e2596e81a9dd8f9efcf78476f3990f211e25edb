i2c: designware: Fix falling time bindings doc

In (6468276 i2c: designware: make SCL and SDA falling time
configurable) new device tree properties were added for setting the
falling time of SDA and SCL.  The device tree bindings doc had a typo
in it: it forgot the "-ns" suffix for both properies in the prose of
the bindings.

I assume this is a typo because:
* The source code includes the "-ns"
* The example in the bindings includes the "-ns".

Fix the typo.
