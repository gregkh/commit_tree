dmaengine: qcom_bam_dma: Generalize BAM register offset calculations

The BAM DMA IP comes in different versions. The register offset layout varies
among these versions. The layouts depend on which generation/family of SoCs they
belong to.

The current SoCs(like 8084, 8074) have a layout where the Top level registers
come in the beginning of the address range, followed by pipe and event
registers. The BAM revision numbers fall above 1.4.0.

The older SoCs (like 8064, 8960) have a layout where the pipe registers come
first, and the top level come later. These have BAM revision numbers lesser than
1.4.0.

It isn't suitable to have macros provide the register offsets with the layouts
changed. Future BAM revisions may have different register layouts too. The
register addresses are now calculated by referring a table which contains a base
offset and multipliers for pipe/evnt/ee registers.

We have a common function bam_addr() which computes addresses for all the
registers. When computing address of top level/ee registers, we pass 0 to the
pipe argument in addr() since they don't have any multiple instances.

Some of the unused register definitions are removed. We can add new registers as
we need them.
