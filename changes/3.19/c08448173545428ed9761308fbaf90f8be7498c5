drm/tilcdc: Deletion of an unnecessary check before the function call "drm_fbdev_cma_hotplug_event"

The drm_fbdev_cma_hotplug_event() function tests whether its argument is NULL
and then returns immediately. Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
