scsi: fix random memory corruption with scsi-mq + T10 PI

This fixes random memory corruption triggered when all three of the
following are true:

* scsi-mq enabled
* T10 Protection Information (DIF) enabled
* SCSI host with sg_tablesize > SCSI_MAX_SG_SEGMENTS (128)

The symptoms of this bug are unpredictable memory corruption, BUG()s,
oopses, lockups, etc., any of which may appear to be completely
unrelated to the root cause.
