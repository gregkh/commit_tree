xen/arm: if(pfn_valid(pfn)) call native dma_ops

Remove code duplication in mm32.c by calling the native dma_ops if the
page is a local page (not a foreign page). Use a simple pfn_valid(pfn)
check to figure out if the page is local, exploiting the fact that dom0
is mapped 1:1, therefore pfn_valid always returns false when called on a
foreign mfn.
