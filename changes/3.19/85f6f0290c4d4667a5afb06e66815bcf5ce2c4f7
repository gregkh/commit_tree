ftrace/x86: Add macro MCOUNT_REG_SIZE for amount of stack used to save mcount regs

The macro save_mcount_regs saves regs onto the stack. But to uncouple the
amount of stack used in that macro from the users of the macro, we need
to have a define that tells all the users how much stack is used by that
macro. This way we can change the amount of stack the macro uses without
breaking its users.

Also remove some dead code that was left over from commit fdc841b58cf5
"ftrace: x86: Remove check of obsolete variable function_trace_stop".
