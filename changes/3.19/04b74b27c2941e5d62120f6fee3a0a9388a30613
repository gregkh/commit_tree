printk/percpu: Define printk_func when printk is not defined

To avoid include hell, the per_cpu variable printk_func was declared
in percpu.h. But it is only defined if printk is defined.

As users of printk may also use the printk_func variable, it needs to
be defined even if CONFIG_PRINTK is not.

Also add a printk.h include in percpu.h just to be safe.
