xtensa: nommu: clean up memory map dump

noMMU configuration doesn't use special area for vmalloc allocations,
don't print it in the memory map.
PAGE_OFFSET is fixed to 0 in noMMU, use min_low_pfn and max_low_pfn for
lowmem range display.
Make all XCHAL_KSEG_* constants unsigned long for consistency with other
addresses.
