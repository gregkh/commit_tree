regulator: s2mps11: Fix dw_mmc failure on Gear 2

Invalid buck4 configuration for linear mapping of voltage in S2MPS14
regulators caused boot failure on Gear 2 (dw_mmc-exynos):

[    3.569137] EXT4-fs (mmcblk0p15): mounted filesystem with ordered data mode. Opts: (null)
[    3.571716] VFS: Mounted root (ext4 filesystem) readonly on device 179:15.
[    3.629842] mmcblk0: error -110 sending status command, retrying
[    3.630244] mmcblk0: error -110 sending status command, retrying
[    3.636292] mmcblk0: error -110 sending status command, aborting

Buck4 voltage regulator has different minimal voltage value than other
bucks. Commit merging multiple regulator description macros caused to
use linear_min_sel from buck[1235] regulators as value for buck4. This
lead to lower voltage of buck4 than required.

Output of the buck4 is used internally as power source for
LDO{3,4,7,11,19,20,21,23}. On Gear 2 board LDO11 is used as MMC
regulator (V_EMMC_1.8V).
