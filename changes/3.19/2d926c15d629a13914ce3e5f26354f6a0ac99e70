hrtimer: Fix incorrect tai offset calculation for non high-res timer systems

I noticed some CLOCK_TAI timer test failures on one of my
less-frequently used configurations. And after digging in I
found in 76f4108892d9 (Cleanup hrtimer accessors to the
timekepeing state), the hrtimer_get_softirq_time tai offset
calucation was incorrectly rewritten, as the tai offset we
return shold be from CLOCK_MONOTONIC, and not CLOCK_REALTIME.

This results in CLOCK_TAI timers expiring early on non-highres
capable machines.

This patch fixes the issue, calculating the tai time properly
from the monotonic base.
