mm: memcontrol: remove unnecessary PCG_USED pc->mem_cgroup valid flag

pc->mem_cgroup had to be left intact after uncharge for the final LRU
removal, and !PCG_USED indicated whether the page was uncharged.  But
since commit 0a31bc97c80c ("mm: memcontrol: rewrite uncharge API") pages
are uncharged after the final LRU removal.  Uncharge can simply clear
the pointer and the PCG_USED/PageCgroupUsed sites can test that instead.

Because this is the last page_cgroup flag, this patch reduces the memcg
per-page overhead to a single pointer.
