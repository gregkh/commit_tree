gpio: sysfs: fix gpio-chip device-attribute leak

The gpio-chip device attributes were never destroyed when the device was
removed.

Fix by using device_create_with_groups() to create the device attributes
of the chip class device.

Note that this also fixes the attribute-creation race with userspace.
