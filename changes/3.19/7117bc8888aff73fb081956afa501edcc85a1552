usermodehelper: don't use CLONE_VFORK for ____call_usermodehelper()

After "kernel/kmod: fix use-after-free of the sub_infostructure"
CLONE_VFORK in __call_usermodehelper() buys nothing, we rely on on
umh_complete() in ____call_usermodehelper() anyway.

Remove it.  This also eliminates the unnecessary sleep/wakeup in the
likely case, and this allows the next change.

While at it, kill the "int wait" locals in ____call_usermodehelper() and
__call_usermodehelper(), they can safely use sub_info->wait.
