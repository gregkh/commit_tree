exit: reparent: introduce find_child_reaper()

find_new_reaper() does 2 completely different things.  Not only it finds a
reaper, it also updates pid_ns->child_reaper or kills the whole namespace
if the caller is ->child_reaper.

Now that has_child_subreaper logic doesn't depend on child_reaper check we
can move that pid_ns code into a separate helper.  IMHO this makes the
code more clean, and this allows the next changes.
