dell-wmi: Don't report keypresses for radio state changes

The WMI events associated to KEY_WLAN are for all the radio devices
available. Use KEY_RFKILL instead since it's more appropriate.

The state of radio devices is changed directly by the BIOS when hotkeys
are pressed, so no events should be reported.
