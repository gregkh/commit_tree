PCI: Allow numa_node override via sysfs

NUMA systems with ACPI normally describe the physical topology via _PXM
methods.  But many BIOSes don't implement _PXM, which leaves the kernel
with no way to discover the device topology, which reduces performance
because we can't put memory and processes close to the device.

The NUMA node of a PCI device is already exported in the sysfs "numa_node"
file.  Make that file writable so users can workaround the lack of _PXM
methods in the BIOS.  For example:

  echo 3 > /sys/devices/pci0000:ff/0000:03:1f.3/numa_node

sets the node for PCI device 0000:03:1f.3.

Writing the file emits a FW_BUG warning to encourage users to request
firmware updates.  It also taints the kernel with TAINT_FIRMWARE_WORKAROUND
because overriding the node incorrectly can cause performance issues.
