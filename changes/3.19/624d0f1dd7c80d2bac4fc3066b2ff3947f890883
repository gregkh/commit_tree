ext4: cleanup flag definitions for extent status tree

Currently flags for extent status tree are defined twice, once shifted
and once without a being shifted. Consolidate these definitions into one
place and make some computations automatic to make adding flags less
error prone. Compiler should be clever enough to figure out these are
constants and generate the same code.
