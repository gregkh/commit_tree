arm: mvebu: define and use common Armada 370 UART pinctrl settings

This patch defines common Armada 370 pinctrl settings for uart0 and
uart1 interfaces:

 uart0: MPP0-1 as default
 uart1: MPP41-42 as default

Note: this patch has the potential to break out-of-tree users w/o
specific pinctrl settings for their uart interfaces if the default
above does not match their config.
