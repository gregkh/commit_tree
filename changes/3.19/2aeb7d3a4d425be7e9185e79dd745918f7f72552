drm/i915: s/pm._irqs_disabled/pm.irqs_enabled/

Double negations just parse harder. Also this allows us to ditch some
init code since clearing to 0 dtrt. Also ditch the assignment in
intel_pm_setup, that's not redundant since we do the assignement now
while setting up interrupts.

While at it do engage in a bit of OCD and wrap up the few lines of
setup/teardown code into little helper functions: intel_irq_fini for
cleanup and intel_irq_init_hw for hw setup.

v2: Use _install/_uninstall for the new wrapper function names as
Paulo suggested.
