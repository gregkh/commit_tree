arm/arm64: vgic: Remove unreachable irq_clear_pending

When 'injecting' an edge-triggered interrupt with a falling edge we
shouldn't clear the pending state on the distributor.  In fact, we
don't, because the check in vgic_validate_injection would prevent us
from ever reaching this bit of code.

Remove the unreachable snippet.
