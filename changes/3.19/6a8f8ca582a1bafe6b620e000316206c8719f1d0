f2fs: avoid race condition in handling wait_io

__submit_merged_bio    f2fs_write_end_io        f2fs_write_end_io
                       wait_io = X              wait_io = x
                       complete(X)              complete(X)
                       wait_io = NULL
wait_for_completion()
free(X)
                                                 spin_lock(X)
                                                 kernel panic

In order to avoid this, this patch removes the wait_io facility.
Instead, we can use wait_on_all_pages_writeback(sbi) to wait for end_ios.
