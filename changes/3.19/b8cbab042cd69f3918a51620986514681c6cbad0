drm/amdkfd: Allow user to limit only queues per device

This patch replaces the two current amdkfd module parameters with a new one.

The current parameters that are being replaced are:

- Maximum number of HSA processes
- Maximum number of queues per process

The new parameter that replaces them is called "Maximum queues per device"

This replacement achieves two goals:

- Allows the user to have as many HSA processes as it wants (until
  a maximum of 512 HSA processes in Kaveri).

- Removes the limitation the user had on maximum number of queues per HSA
  process. E.g. the user can now have processes which only have one queue and
  other processes which have hundreds of queues, while before the user
  couldn't have more than 128 queues per process (as default).

The default value of the new parameter is 4096 (32 * 128, which were the
defaults of the old parameters). There is almost no additional GART memory
required for the default case. As a reminder, this amount of queues requires a
little bit below 4MB of GART memory.

v2:
In addition, This patch defines a new counter for queues accounting in the DQM
structure. This is done because the current counter only counts active queues
which allows the user to create more queues than the
max_num_of_queues_per_device module parameter allows.

However, we need the current counter for the runlist packet build process, so
the solution is to have a dedicated counter for this accounting.
