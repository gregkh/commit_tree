mm, compaction: defer only on COMPACT_COMPLETE

Deferred compaction is employed to avoid compacting zone where sync direct
compaction has recently failed.  As such, it makes sense to only defer
when a full zone was scanned, which is when compact_zone returns with
COMPACT_COMPLETE.  It's less useful to defer when compact_zone returns
with apparent success (COMPACT_PARTIAL), followed by a watermark check
failure, which can happen due to parallel allocation activity.  It also
does not make much sense to defer compaction which was completely skipped
(COMPACT_SKIP) for being unsuitable in the first place.

This patch therefore makes deferred compaction trigger only when
COMPACT_COMPLETE is returned from compact_zone().  Results of
stress-highalloc becnmark show the difference is within measurement error,
so the issue is rather cosmetic.
