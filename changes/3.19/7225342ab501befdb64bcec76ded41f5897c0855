drm/i915: Build workaround list in ring initialization

If we build the workaround list in ring initialization
and decouple it from the actual writing of values, we
gain the ability to decide where and how we want to apply
the values.

The advantage of this will become more clear when
we need to initialize workarounds on older gens where
it is not possible to write all the registers through ring
LRIs.

v2: rebase on newest bdw workarounds
