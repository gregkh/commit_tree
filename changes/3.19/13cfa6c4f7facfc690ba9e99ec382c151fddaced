ARM: EXYNOS: Fix CPU idle clock down after CPU off

On Exynos4 USE_DELAYED_RESET_ASSERTION must be set in
ARM_COREx_OPTION register during CPU power down. This is the proper way
of powering down CPU on Exynos4.

Additionally on Exynos4212 without this the CPU clock down feature won't
work after powering down some CPU and the online CPUs will work at full
frequency chosen by CPUfreq governor.
