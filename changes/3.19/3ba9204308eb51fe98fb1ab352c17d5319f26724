reset: stih407: Add softreset, powerdown and picophy controllers

This patch adds softreset, powerdown and picophy reset controllers for
the STiH407 SoC.

With this patch three new devices are registered: -
1. st,stih407-powerdown
2. st,stih407-softreset
3. st,stih407-picophyreset

All three devices use system configuration registers mapped via regmap to
perform the reset or powerdown. The powerdown controller also has
an acknowledgement.

A separate picophy reset controller manages the different reset channels within
the picophy, which have a different polarity to the other system softresets.
Managing these different picophy softreset channels is necessary to correctly
handle resuming from suspend when USB2 devices are plugged into the USB3 port.
