ARM: OMAP3: clock: fix boot breakage in legacy mode

The new usage of determine_rate and set_rate_and_parent calls for
OMAP DPLLs assumes the DPLLs must have two parents defined, even
if it is the same clock. Legacy clock data did not fullfill this
requirement and caused a boot crash. Fixed by adding the missing
parent information to the DPLL clocks.
