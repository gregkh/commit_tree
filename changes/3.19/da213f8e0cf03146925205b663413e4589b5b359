Bluetooth: Revert SMP self-test patches

This reverts commits c6992e9ef2a17e9738b7bb8a03a7fe581a8f9977 and
4cd3362da899a59955146851dd860198b0aaaa75.

The reason for the revert is that we cannot have more than one module
initialization function and the SMP one breaks the build with modular
kernels. As the proper fix for this is right now looking non-trivial
it's better to simply revert the problematic patches in order to keep
the upstream tree compilable.
