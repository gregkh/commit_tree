serial: of-serial: add PM suspend/resume support

This adds suspend/resume support for the of-serial driver
to provide power management support on devices attatched.

The handling may vary since not every of_serial device is
an 8250 port. Currently only 8250 port handling is added
in the suspend/resume function based on the type switch.
