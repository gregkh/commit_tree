ARM: mvebu: Fix pinctrl configuration for Armada 370 DB

The commit b4607572ef86 (ARM: mvebu: remove conflicting muxing on
Armada 370 DB) removes the hog pins muxing. As it is explained in the
commit log it solves a warning a boot time, but more important it also
allows using the Giga port 0 of the board.

Unfortunately in the same time the commit 4904a82a9399 (arm: mvebu:
move Armada 370/XP pinctrl node definition armada-370-xp.dtsi) was
merged and it introduced again the hog pins muxing. Because of it, the
Giga port 0 of the board is no more usable.

This commit remove again the conflicting muxing (hopefully for the
last time).
