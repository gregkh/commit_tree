iwlwifi: mvm/trans: abort d0i3_enter in case of held ref

Other contexts might call iwl_mvm_ref_sync() right before
we set IWL_MVM_STATUS_IN_D0I3, and then assume the fw/bus
is not in d0i3 state.

However, since we currently don't check for held references
in the d0i3_enter flow, we might enter d0i3 although there
is an active reference.

Solve it by aborting the d0i3 enter flow if there is an
active reference. Since users are assumed to use
iwl_mvm_ref_sync, which takes a ref before checking the
flag, we don't need further locking.
