arm64/mm: Remove hack in mmap randomize layout

Since commit 8a0a9bd4db63 ('random: make get_random_int() more
random'), get_random_int() returns a random value for each call,
so comment and hack introduced in mmap_rnd() as part of commit
1d18c47c735e ('arm64: MMU fault handling and page table management')
are incorrects.

Commit 1d18c47c735e seems to use the same hack introduced by
commit a5adc91a4b44 ('powerpc: Ensure random space between stack
and mmaps'), latter copied in commit 5a0efea09f42 ('sparc64: Sharpen
address space randomization calculations.').

But both architectures were cleaned up as part of commit
fa8cbaaf5a68 ('powerpc+sparc64/mm: Remove hack in mmap randomize
layout') as hack is no more needed since commit 8a0a9bd4db63.

So the present patch removes the comment and the hack around
get_random_int() on AArch64's mmap_rnd().
