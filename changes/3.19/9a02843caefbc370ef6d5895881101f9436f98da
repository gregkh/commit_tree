ALSA: dice: Add support for duplex streams with synchronization

This commit adds support for AMDTP in-stream. As a result, Dice driver
supports full duplex streams with synchronization.

AMDTP can transfer timestamps in its packets. By handling the timestamp,
devices can synchronize to the other devices or drivers on the same bus.

When Dice chipset is 'enabled', it starts streams with correct settings.
This 'enable' register is global, thus, when a stream is started to run,
an opposite stream can't start unless turning off 'enable'. Therefore
a pair of streams must be running. This causes a loss of CPU usage when
single stream is needed for neither playbacking or capturing.

This commit assumes that playback-only models also have a functionality
to transmit stream for delivering timestamps.

Currently, sampling clock source is restricted to SYT-Match mode. This is
improved in followed commit. I note that at SYT-Match mode, Dice can select
from 4 streams for synchronization but this driver uses the 1st stream only
for simplicity.
