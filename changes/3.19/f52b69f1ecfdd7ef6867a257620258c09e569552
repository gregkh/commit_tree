drm/atomic: Don't overrun the connector array when hotplugging

Yet another fallout from not considering DP MST hotplug. With the
previous patches we have stable indices, but it might still happen
that a connector gets added between when we allocate the array and
when we actually add a connector. Especially when we back off due to
ww mutex contention or similar issues.

So store the sizes of the arrays in struct drm_atomic_state and double
check them. We don't really care about races except that we want to
use a consistent value, so ACCESS_ONCE is all we need. And if we
indeed notice that we'd overrun the array then just give up and
restart the entire ioctl.
