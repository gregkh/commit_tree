proc: task_state: read cred->group_info outside of task_lock()

task_state() reads cred->group_info under task_lock() because a long ago
it was task_struct->group_info and it was actually protected by
task->alloc_lock.  Today this task_unlock() after rcu_read_unlock() just
adds the confusion, move task_unlock() up.
