f2fs: avoid unable to restart gc thread in remount

In f2fs_remount, we will stop gc thread and set need_restart_gc as true when new
option is set without BG_GC, then if any error occurred in the following
procedure, we can restore to start the gc thread.
But after that, We will fail to restore gc thread in start_gc_thread as BG_GC is
not set in new option, so we'd better move this condition judgment out of
start_gc_thread to fix this issue.
