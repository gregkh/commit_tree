sh_eth: Fix access to TRSCER register

TRSCER register is configured differently by SoCs. TRSCER of R-Car Gen2 is
RINT8 bit only valid, other bits are reserved bits. This removes access to
TRSCER register reserve bit by adding variable trscer_err_mask to
sh_eth_cpu_data structure, set the register information to each SoCs.
