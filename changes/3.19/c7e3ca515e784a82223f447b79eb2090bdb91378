iommu/tegra: gart: Do not register with bus

The driver currently doesn't work as expected and causes existing setups
with Tegra20 to break after commit df06b759f2cf ("drm/tegra: Add IOMMU
support"). To restore these setups, do not register the operations with
the platform bus for now. Fixing this properly will involve non-trivial
changes to the DRM driver, which are unlikely to be accepted at this
point in the release cycle.
