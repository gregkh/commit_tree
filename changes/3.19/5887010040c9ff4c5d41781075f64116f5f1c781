gpio: msm-v1: make boolean argument more obvious

irq_set_irq_wake() treats its second argument as a boolean. It is much
easier to read code when constant booleans are either 0 or 1!

This particular line of code distracted me somewhat when I was doing a bit of
work in a code browser since it (spuriously) got me worried that I had
misunderstood how irq_set_irq_wake() worked.
