dm thin: remap the bios in a cell immediately

This use of direct submission in process_prepared_mapping() reduces
latency for submitting bios in a cell by avoiding adding those bios to
the deferred list and waiting for the next iteration of the worker.

But this direct submission exposes the potential for a race between
releasing a cell and incrementing deferred set.  Fix this by introducing
dm_cell_visit_release() and refactoring inc_remap_and_issue_cell()
accordingly.
