usb: musb: core: use ->resume instead ->resume_noirq

In commit 0ec8fd70fb ("USB: musb: fix possible panic while resuming")
musb_resume() became musb_resume_early() in order to enable the clocks
early on resume. This piece of the resume code was removed later in
commit 034917612 ("usb: musb: move clock handling to glue layer").
In between the function was renamed from musb_resume_early() to
musb_resume_noirq() by commit commit 48fea9659e ("USB: Rework musb
suspend()/resume_early()").

Now I see that first musb_core is resumed followed by phy and glue
layer and I ask myself is this really what we intend to do? This kind
of revoked the purpose of the first commit (0ec8fd70fb).
Because of this and because it looks wrong to resume (core) before the
glue layer I push it to the ->resume callback.
