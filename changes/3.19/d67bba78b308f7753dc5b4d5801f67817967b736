fusbh200: Remove superfluous macro definitions

The fusbh200_dbg_port struct is a copy of the ehci_dbg_port definition
in the <linux/usb/ehci_def.h> header.  Embedded in this definition are
a number of macros which came along for the ride.  These macros are not
used in the fusbh200 driver and will conflict those in the new
<linux/usb/ehci-dbgp.h> header.
