proc: task_state: ptrace_parent() doesn't need pid_alive() check

p->ptrace != 0 means that release_task(p) was not called, so pid_alive()
buys nothing and we can remove this check.  Other callers already use it
directly without additional checks.

Note: with or without this patch ptrace_parent() can return the pointer to
the freed task, this will be explained/fixed later.
