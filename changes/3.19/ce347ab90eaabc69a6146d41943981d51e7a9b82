IPoIB: No longer use flush as a parameter

Various places in the IPoIB code had a deadlock related to flushing
the ipoib workqueue.  Now that we have per device workqueues and a
specific flush workqueue, there is no longer a deadlock issue with
flushing the device specific workqueues and we can do so unilaterally.
