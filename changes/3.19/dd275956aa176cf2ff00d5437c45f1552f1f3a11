drm/atomic: add plane iterator macros

Add helper macros to iterate the current, or incoming set of planes
attached to a crtc.  These helpers are only available for drivers
converted to use atomic-helpers.

[danvet: Squash in fixup from Rob to move the planemask iterator to
drm_crtc.h and document it. That one is needed by the atomic ioctl so
can't be in a helper library.]
