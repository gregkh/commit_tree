ASoC: sgtl5000: add delay before first I2C access

To quote from section 1.3.1 of the data sheet:
	The SGTL5000 has an internal reset that is deasserted
	8 SYS_MCLK cycles after all power rails have been brought
	up. After this time, communication can start

	...
	1.0us represents 8 SYS_MCLK cycles at the minimum 8.0 MHz SYS_MCLK.
