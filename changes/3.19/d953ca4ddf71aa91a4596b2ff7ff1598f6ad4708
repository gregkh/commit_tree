hyperv: Fix the error processing in netvsc_send()

The existing code frees the skb in EAGAIN case, in which the skb will be
retried from upper layer and used again.
Also, the existing code doesn't free send buffer slot in error case, because
there is no completion message for unsent packets.
This patch fixes these problems.

(Please also include this patch for stable trees. Thanks!)
