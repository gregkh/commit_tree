x86/apic: Re-enable PCI_MSI support for non-SMP X86_32

Commit 0dbc6078c06bc0 ('x86, build, pci: Fix PCI_MSI build on !SMP')
introduced the dependency that X86_UP_APIC is only available when
PCI_MSI is false. This effectively prevents PCI_MSI support on 32bit
UP systems because it disables both APIC and IO-APIC. But APIC support
is architecturally required for PCI_MSI.

The intention of the patch was to enforce APIC support when PCI_MSI is
enabled, but failed to do so.

Remove the !PCI_MSI dependency from X86_UP_APIC and enforce
X86_UP_APIC when PCI_MSI support is enabled on 32bit UP systems.
