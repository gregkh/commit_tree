Staging: rtl8192u: Annotate association types with proper endianness

This patch fixes following sparse warning at number of places in
file rtl819x_BAProc.c.

Warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
         expected unsigned short [unsigned] [usertype] tmp
         got restricted __le16 [usertype] <noident>

Here, code before this change is correct. But this change silents
sparse warnings and will not harm code too.
