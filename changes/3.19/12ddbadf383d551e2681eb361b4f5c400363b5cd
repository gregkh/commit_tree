[media] media: rc: add driver for Amlogic Meson IR remote receiver

Amlogic Meson SoCs include a infrared remote control receiver that can
operate in two modes: "NEC" mode in which the hardware decodes frames
using the NEC IR protocol, and "general" mode in which the receiver
simply reports the duration of pulses and spaces for software
decoding.

This is a driver for the IR receiver that implements software decoding
of received frames.
