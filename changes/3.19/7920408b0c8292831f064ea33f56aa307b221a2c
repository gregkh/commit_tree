tty: serial: msm_serial: Don't require DT aliases

If there isn't a DT alias then of_alias_get_id() will return
-ENODEV. This will cause the msm_serial driver to fail probe,
when we want to keep the previous behavior where we generated a
dynamic line number at probe time. Restore this behavior by
generating a dynamic id if the line number is still negative
after checking for an alias or in the non-DT case looking at the
.id field of the platform device.
