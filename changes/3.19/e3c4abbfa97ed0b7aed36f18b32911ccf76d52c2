integrity: define a new function integrity_read_file()

This patch defines a new function called integrity_read_file()
to read file from the kernel into a buffer. Subsequent patches
will read a file containing the public keys and load them onto
the IMA keyring.

This patch moves and renames ima_kernel_read(), the non-security
checking version of kernel_read(), to integrity_kernel_read().

Changes in v3:
* Patch descriptions improved (Mimi)
* Add missing cast (kbuild test robot)

Changes in v2:
* configuration option removed
* function declared as '__init'
