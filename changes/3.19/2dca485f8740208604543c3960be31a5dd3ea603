KVM: s390: flush CPU on load control

some control register changes will flush some aspects of the CPU, e.g.
POP explicitely mentions that for CR9-CR11 "TLBs may be cleared".
Instead of trying to be clever and only flush on specific CRs, let
play safe and flush on all lctl(g) as future machines might define
new bits in CRs. Load control intercept should not happen that often.
