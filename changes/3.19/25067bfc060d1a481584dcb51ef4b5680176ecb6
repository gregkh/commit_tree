drm/i915: pin sprite fb only if it changed

Optimize code avoiding helding dev mutex if old fb and current fb
are the same.

v2: take Ville's comments
	- move comment along with the pin_and_fence call
	- check for error before calling i915_gem_track_fb
	- move old_obj != obj to an upper if condition
