ARM: 8196/1: vfp: Workaround bad MVFR1 register on some Kraits

Certain versions of the Krait processor don't report that they
support the fused multiply accumulate instruction via the MVFR1
register despite the fact that they actually do. Unfortunately we
use this register to identify support for VFPv4. Override the
hwcap on all Krait processors to indicate support for VFPv4 to
workaround this.
