staging: comedi: comedidev.h: remove dummy PCI support functions

Some low-level Comedi driver modules used to handle PCI devices and ISA
devices in the same module with some conditional compilation.  To reduce
the amount of conditional compilation, some dummy inline versions of
`comedi_to_pci_dev()`, `comedi_pci_enable()`, `comedi_pci_disable()`,
and `comedi_pci_detach()` are defined in "comedidev.h" if
`CONFIG_COMEDI_PCI_DRIVERS` is undefined.  Since those Comedi low-level
driver modules have since had PCI support split out into separate
modules, there is no need to keep the dummy inline functions around any
more, so remove them.
