dm thin: don't allow messages to be sent to a pool target in READ_ONLY or FAIL mode

You can't modify the metadata in these modes.  It's better to fail these
messages immediately than let the block-manager deny write locks on
metadata blocks.  Otherwise these failed metadata changes will trigger
'needs_check' to get set in the metadata superblock -- requiring repair
using the thin_check utility.
