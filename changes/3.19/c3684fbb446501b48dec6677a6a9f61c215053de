arm64: Move cpu_resume into the text section

The function cpu_resume currently lives in the .data section.
There's no reason for it to be there since we can use relative
instructions without a problem. Move a few cpu_resume data
structures out of the assembly file so the .data annotation
can be dropped completely and cpu_resume ends up in the read
only text section.
