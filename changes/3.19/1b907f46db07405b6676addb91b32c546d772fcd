arm64: kconfig: move emulation option under kernel features

Having the instruction emulation submenu underneath "platform selection"
is a great way to hide options we don't want people to use, but somewhat
confusing when you stumble across it there.

Move the menuconfig option underneath "kernel features", where it makes
a bit more sense.
