sched: Fix schedule_tail() to disable preemption

finish_task_switch() enables preemption, so post_schedule(rq) can be
called on the wrong (and even dead) CPU. Afaics, nothing really bad
can happen, but in this case we can wrongly clear rq->post_schedule
on that CPU. And this simply looks wrong in any case.
