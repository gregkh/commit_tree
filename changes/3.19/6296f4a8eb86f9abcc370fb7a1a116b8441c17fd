HID: i2c-hid: fix race condition reading reports

Current driver uses a common buffer for reading reports either
synchronously in i2c_hid_get_raw_report() and asynchronously in
the interrupt handler.
There is race condition if an interrupt arrives immediately after
the report is received in i2c_hid_get_raw_report(); the common
buffer is modified by the interrupt handler with the new report
and then i2c_hid_get_raw_report() proceed using wrong data.

Fix it by using a separate buffers for synchronous reports.
