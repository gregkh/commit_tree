IB/srp: Introduce two new srp_target_port member variables

Introduce the srp_target_port member variables 'sgid' and 'pkey'.
Change the type of 'orig_dgid' from __be16[8] into union ib_gid.
This patch does not change any functionality but makes the
"Separate target and channel variables" patch easier to verify.
