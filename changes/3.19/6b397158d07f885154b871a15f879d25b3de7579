kvm: remove IA64 ioctls

KVM ia64 is no longer present so new applications shouldn't use them.
The main problem is that they most likely didn't work even before,
because of a conflict in the #defines:

  #define KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG       _IOW(KVMIO,  0x9b, struct kvm_guest_debug)
  #define KVM_IA64_VCPU_SET_STACK   _IOW(KVMIO,  0x9b, void *)

The argument to KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG is:

  struct kvm_guest_debug {
  	__u32 control;
  	__u32 pad;
  	struct kvm_guest_debug_arch arch;
  };

  struct kvm_guest_debug_arch {
  };

meaning that sizeof(struct kvm_guest_debug) == sizeof(void *) == 8
and KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG == KVM_IA64_VCPU_SET_STACK.

KVM_SET_GUEST_DEBUG is handled in virt/kvm/kvm_main.c before even calling
kvm_arch_vcpu_ioctl (which would have handled KVM_IA64_VCPU_SET_STACK),
so KVM_IA64_VCPU_SET_STACK would just return -EINVAL.
