tty: serial: 8250_dma: handle error on TX submit

Right now it is possible that serial8250_tx_dma() fails and returns
-EBUSY. The caller (serial8250_start_tx()) will then enable
UART_IER_THRI which will generate an interrupt once the TX FIFO is
empty.
In serial8250_handle_irq() nothing will happen because up->dma is set
and so serial8250_tx_chars() won't be invoked. We end up with plenty of
interrupts and some "too much work for irq" output.

This patch introduces dma_tx_err in struct uart_8250_port to signal that
the last invocation of serial8250_tx_dma() failed so we can fill the TX
FIFO manually. Should the next invocation of serial8250_start_tx()
succeed then the dma_tx_err flag along with the THRI bit is removed and
DMA only usage may continue.
