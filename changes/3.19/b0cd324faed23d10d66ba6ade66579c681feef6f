drm/i915: don't save/restore backlight hist ctl registers

This is not used within the driver, and merely saving/restoring these
registers isn't going to do any good anyway. In fact, it's possible it's
actively harmful. Any code enabling the feature should handle this
completely in the regular platform specific enable/disable backlight
functions.
