mtd: nand: Base BCH ECC bytes on required strength

NAND devices with page sizes over 4 KiB require more than 4-bits of ECC
coverage. This patch calculates the value of ecc_bytes based on a still
assumed 512-byte step size (13-bits) and the ecc_strength.

Example:
Micron M73A devices (8 KiB page) require 8-bit ECC per 512-byte
