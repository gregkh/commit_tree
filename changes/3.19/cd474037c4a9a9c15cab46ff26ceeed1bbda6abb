[media] vb2: replace 'write' by 'dma_dir'

The 'write' argument is very ambiguous. I first assumed that if it is 1,
then we're doing video output but instead it meant the reverse.

Since it is used to setup the dma_dir value anyway it is now replaced by
the correct dma_dir value which is unambiguous.
