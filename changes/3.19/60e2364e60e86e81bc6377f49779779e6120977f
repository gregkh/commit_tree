perf: Add ability to sample machine state on interrupt

Enable capture of interrupted machine state for each sample.

Registers to sample are passed per event in the sample_regs_intr bitmask.

To sample interrupt machine state, the PERF_SAMPLE_INTR_REGS must be passed in
sample_type.

The list of available registers is arch dependent and provided by asm/perf_regs.h

Registers are laid out as u64 in the order of the bit order of sample_intr_regs.

This patch also adds a new ABI version PERF_ATTR_SIZE_VER4 because we extend
the perf_event_attr struct with a new u64 field.
