kdb: Categorize kdb commands (similar to SysRq categorization)

This patch introduces several new flags to collect kdb commands into
groups (later allowing them to be optionally disabled).

This follows similar prior art to enable/disable magic sysrq
commands.

The commands have been categorized as follows:

Always on:  go (w/o args), env, set, help, ?, cpu (w/o args), sr,
            dmesg, disable_nmi, defcmd, summary, grephelp
Mem read:   md, mdr, mdp, mds, ef, bt (with args), per_cpu
Mem write:  mm
Reg read:   rd
Reg write:  go (with args), rm
Inspect:    bt (w/o args), btp, bta, btc, btt, ps, pid, lsmod
Flow ctrl:  bp, bl, bph, bc, be, bd, ss
Signal:     kill
Reboot:     reboot
All:        cpu, kgdb, (and all of the above), nmi_console
