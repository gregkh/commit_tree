can: eliminate banner[] variable and switch to pr_info()

Several CAN modules use a design pattern with a banner[] variable at the
top which defines a string that is used once during init to print the
banner.  The string is also embedded with KERN_INFO which makes it
printk() specific.

Improve the code by eliminating the banner[] variable and moving the
string to where it is printed.  Then switch from printk(KERN_INFO to
pr_info() for the lines that were changed.
