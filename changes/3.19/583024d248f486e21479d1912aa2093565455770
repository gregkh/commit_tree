dm thin: suspend/resume active thin devices when reloading thin-pool

Before this change it was expected that userspace would first suspend
all active thin devices, reload/resize the thin-pool target, then resume
all active thin devices.  Now the thin-pool suspend/resume will trigger
the suspend/resume of all active thins via appropriate calls to
dm_internal_suspend and dm_internal_resume.

Store the mapped_device for each thin device in struct thin_c to make
these calls possible.
