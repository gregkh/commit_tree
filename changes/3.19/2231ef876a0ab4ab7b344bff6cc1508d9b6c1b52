sun3_scsi: Move macro definitions

The #defines in sun3_scsi.h are intended to influence subsequent #includes
in sun3_scsi.c. IMHO, that's too convoluted.

Move sun3_scsi.h macro definitions to sun3_scsi.c, consistent with other
NCR5380 drivers.

Omit the unused NCR5380_local_declare() and NCR5380_setup() macros.
