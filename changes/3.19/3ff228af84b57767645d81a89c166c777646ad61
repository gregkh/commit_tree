atari_scsi: Convert to platform device

Convert atari_scsi to platform device and eliminate scsi_register().

Validate __setup options later on so that module options are checked as well.

Remove the comment about the scsi mid-layer disabling the host irq as it
is no longer true (AFAICT). Also remove the obsolete slow interrupt stuff
(IRQ_TYPE_SLOW == 0 anyway).
