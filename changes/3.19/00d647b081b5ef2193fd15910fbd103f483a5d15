ASoC: jack: update calls to gpiod_get*()

Add the new flags argument to calls of (devm_)gpiod_get*() and
remove any direction setting code afterwards.

Currently both forms (with or without the flags argument)
are valid thanks to transitional macros in
<linux/gpio/consumer.h>. These macros will be removed once
all consumers are updated and the flags argument will become
compulsary.
