xen/arm: use hypercall to flush caches in map_page

In xen_dma_map_page, if the page is a local page, call the native
map_page dma_ops. If the page is foreign, call __xen_dma_map_page that
issues any required cache maintenane operations via hypercall.

The reason for doing this is that the native dma_ops map_page could
allocate buffers than need to be freed. If the page is foreign we don't
call the native unmap_page dma_ops function, resulting in a memory leak.
