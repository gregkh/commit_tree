xfs: fix error handling in xfs_qm_log_quotaoff()

The error handling in xfs_qm_log_quotaoff() has a couple problems. If
xfs_trans_commit() fails, we fall through to the error block and call
xfs_trans_cancel(). This is incorrect on commit failure. If
xfs_trans_reserve() fails, we jump to the error block, cancel the tp and
restore the superblock qflags to oldsbqflag. However, oldsbqflag has
been initialized to zero and not yet updated from the original flags so
we set the flags to zero.

Fix up the error handling in xfs_qm_log_quotaoff() to not restore flags
if they haven't been modified and not cancel the tp on commit failure.
Remove the flag restore code altogether because commit error is the only
failure condition and we don't know whether the transaction made it to
disk.
