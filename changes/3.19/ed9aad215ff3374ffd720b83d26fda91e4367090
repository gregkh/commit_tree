KVM: x86: MOVNTI emulation min opsize is not respected

Commit 3b32004a66e9 ("KVM: x86: movnti minimum op size of 32-bit is not kept")
did not fully fix the minimum operand size of MONTI emulation. Still, MOVNTI
may be mistakenly performed using 16-bit opsize.

This patch add No16 flag to mark an instruction does not support 16-bits
operand size.
