wil6210: remove wil_to_pcie_dev()

There is no need to obtain physical device through
wil->pdev->dev path, as it is done by this macro.
The same device already stored as wiphy's device, thus
wil_to_dev() returns the same device as wil_to_pcie_dev()

Remove unnecessary macros, this allows to drop dependency
by pci.h in the firmware download code.
