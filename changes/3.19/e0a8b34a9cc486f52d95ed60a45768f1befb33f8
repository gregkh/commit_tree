cxgb4vf: Add and initialize some sge params for VF driver

Add sge_vf_eq_qpp and sge_vf_iq_qpp to (struct sge_params), initialize
sge_queues_per_page and sge_vf_qpp in t4vf_get_sge_params(), add new
t4vf_prep_adapter() which initializes basic adapter parameters.

Grab both SGE_EGRESS_QUEUES_PER_PAGE_VF and SGE_INGRESS_QUEUES_PER_PAGE_VF
for VF Drivers since we need both to calculate the User Doorbell area
offsets for Egress and Ingress Queues.
