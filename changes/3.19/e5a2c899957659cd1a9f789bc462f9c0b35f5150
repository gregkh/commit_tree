fast_hash: avoid indirect function calls

By default the arch_fast_hash hashing function pointers are initialized
to jhash(2). If during boot-up a CPU with SSE4.2 is detected they get
updated to the CRC32 ones. This dispatching scheme incurs a function
pointer lookup and indirect call for every hashing operation.

rhashtable as a user of arch_fast_hash e.g. stores pointers to hashing
functions in its structure, too, causing two indirect branches per
hashing operation.

Using alternative_call we can get away with one of those indirect branches.
