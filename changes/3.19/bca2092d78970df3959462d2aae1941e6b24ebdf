serial: 8250_dw: Use 64-bit access for OCTEON.

Although the existing code appears to work on most hardware, the
hardware designers tell us that 8-bit access to the registers is not
guaranteed to be reliable.  Also the OCTEON simulation environments
prohibit 8-bit accesses.

For these reasons, we use __raw_readq/__raw_writeq for OCTEON.  This
code is protected with #ifdef CONFIG_64BIT so it still builds under
configurations lacking readq/writeq.

We can get rid of the #ifdef __BIG_ENDIAN, as under 64-bit accesses,
OCTEON is byte order invariant.
