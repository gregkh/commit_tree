Bluetooth: Add ECC library for LE Secure Connections

This patch adds a simple ECC library that will act as a fundamental
building block for LE Secure Connections. The library has a simple API
consisting of two functions: one for generating a public/private key
pair and another one for generating a Diffie-Hellman key from a local
private key and a remote public key.

The code has been taken from https://github.com/kmackay/easy-ecc and
modified to conform with the kernel coding style.
