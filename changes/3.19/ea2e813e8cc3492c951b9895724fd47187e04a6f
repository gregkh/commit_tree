[media] tlg2300: move to staging in preparation for removal

This driver hasn't been tested in a long, long time. The company that made
this chip has gone bust many years ago and hardware using this chip is next
to impossible to find.

This driver needs to be converted to newer media frameworks but due to the
lack of hardware that's going to be impossible. Since cheap alternatives are
easily available, there is little point in keeping this driver alive.

In other words, this driver is a prime candidate for removal. If someone is
interested in working on this driver to prevent its removal, then please
contact the linux-media mailinglist.
