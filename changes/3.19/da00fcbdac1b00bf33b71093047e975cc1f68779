KVM: s390: trigger the right CPU exit for floating interrupts

When injecting a floating interrupt and no CPU is idle we
kick one CPU to do an external exit. In case of I/O we
should trigger an I/O exit instead. This does not matter
for Linux guests as external and I/O interrupts are
enabled/disabled at the same time, but play safe anyway.

The same holds true for machine checks. Since there is no
special exit, just reuse the generic stop exit. The injection
code inside the VCPU loop will recheck anyway and rearm the
proper exits (e.g. control registers) if necessary.
