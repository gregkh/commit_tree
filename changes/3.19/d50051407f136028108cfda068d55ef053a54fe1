ipv6: Allow sending packets through tunnels with wildcard endpoints

Currently we need the IP6_TNL_F_CAP_XMIT capabiltiy to transmit
packets through an ipv6 tunnel. This capability is set when the
tunnel gets configured, based on the tunnel endpoint addresses.

On tunnels with wildcard tunnel endpoints, we need to do the
capabiltiy checking on a per packet basis like it is done in
the receive path.

This patch extends ip6_tnl_xmit_ctl() to take local and remote
addresses as parameters to allow for per packet capabiltiy
checking.
