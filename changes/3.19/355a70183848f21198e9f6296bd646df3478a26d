drm/gem: Warn on illegal use of the dumb buffer interface v2

It happens on occasion that developers of generic user-space applications
abuse the dumb buffer API to get hold of drm buffers that they can both
mmap() and use for GPU acceleration, using the assumptions that dumb buffers
and buffers available for GPU are
a) The same type and can be aribtrarily type-casted.
b) fully coherent.

This patch makes the most widely used drivers warn nicely when that happens,
the next step will be to fail.

v2: Move drmP.h changes to drm_gem.h. Fix Radeon dumb mmap breakage.
