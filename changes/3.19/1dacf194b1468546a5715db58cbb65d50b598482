irqchip: irq-armada-370-xp: Use proper return value for ->set_affinity()

The ->set_affinity() hook of 'struct irq_chip' is supposed to return
one of IRQ_SET_MASK_OK or IRQ_SET_MASK_OK_NOCOPY. However, the code
currently simply returns 0. This patch fixes that by using
IRQ_SET_MASK_OK, which tells the IRQ core that it is responsible for
updating irq_data.affinity.

Note that this patch does not cause any change to the compiled code,
as IRQ_SET_MASK_OK has the value 0. This is therefore just a simple
cleanup.
