kvm: svm: move WARN_ON in svm_adjust_tsc_offset

When running the tsc_adjust kvm-unit-test on an AMD processor with the
IA32_TSC_ADJUST feature enabled, the WARN_ON in svm_adjust_tsc_offset can be
triggered. This WARN_ON checks for a negative adjustment in case __scale_tsc
is called; however it may trigger unnecessary warnings.

This patch moves the WARN_ON to trigger only if __scale_tsc will actually be
called from svm_adjust_tsc_offset. In addition make adj in kvm_set_msr_common
s64 since this can have signed values.
