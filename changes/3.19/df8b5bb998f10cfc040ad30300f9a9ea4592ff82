mm/zsmalloc: avoid duplicate assignment of prev_class

In zs_create_pool(), prev_class is assigned (ZS_SIZE_CLASSES - 1) times.
And the prev_class only references to the previous size_class.  So we do
not need unnecessary assignement.

This patch assigns *prev_class* when a new size_class structure is
allocated and uses prev_class to check whether the first class has been
allocated.
