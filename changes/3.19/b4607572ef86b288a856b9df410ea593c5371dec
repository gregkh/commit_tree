ARM: mvebu: remove conflicting muxing on Armada 370 DB

Back when audio was enabled, the muxing of some MPP pins was causing
problems. However, since commit fea038ed55ae ("ARM: mvebu: Add proper
pin muxing on the Armada 370 DB board"), those problematic MPP pins
have been assigned a proper muxing for the Ethernet interfaces. This
proper muxing is now conflicting with the hog pins muxing that had
been added as part of 249f3822509b ("ARM: mvebu: add audio support to
Armada 370 DB").

Therefore, this commit simply removes the hog pins muxing, which
solves a warning a boot time due to the conflicting muxing
requirements.
