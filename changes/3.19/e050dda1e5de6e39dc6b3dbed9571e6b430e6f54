staging: rts5208: get rid of Camel Case, remove unneeded lines and parantheses

Convert labels from Camel Case to lower case, remove unnecessary
parantheses around operands of dereference operators and remove unneeded
empty lines before }.

Gets rid of a checkpatch.pl "check" that code should avoid Camel Case,
also the code had a bunch of &(a) where a is some variable so it gets
rid of them too.  Finally, in a few places there were a empty line
before } so remove them.
