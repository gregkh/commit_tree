ARM: expand fixmap region to 3MB

With commit a05e54c103b0 ("ARM: 8031/2: change fixmap mapping region to
support 32 CPUs"), the fixmap region was expanded to 2MB, but it
precluded any other uses of the fixmap region. In order to support other
uses the fixmap region needs to be expanded beyond 2MB. Fortunately, the
adjacent 1MB range 0xffe00000-0xfff00000 is availabe.

Remove fixmap_page_table ptr and lookup the page table via the virtual
address so that the fixmap region can span more that one pmd. The 2nd
pmd is already created since it is shared with the vector page.
