drm/i915: Pin tiled objects for L-shaped configs

Let's just throw in the towel on this one and take the cheap way out.

Based on a patch from Chris Wilson, but checking for a different bit.
Chris' patch checked for even bank layout, this one here for a magic
bit. Given the evidence we've gathered (not much) both work I think,
but checking for the magic bit might be more accurate.

Anyway, works on my gm45 here.

For paranoi restrict to gen4 (and mobile), since we've only ever seen
this on gm45 and i965gm.

Also add some debugfs output so that we can skip the tiled swapping
tests properly in these cases.

v2: Clean up the quirk'ed pin count in free_object to avoid upsetting
the WARN_ON. Spotted by Chris.
