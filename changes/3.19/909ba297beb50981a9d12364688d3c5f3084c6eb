ARM: 8292/1: mm: fix size rounding-down of arm_add_memory() function

The current rounding of "size" is wrong:

 - If "start" is sufficiently near the next page boundary, "size"
   is decremented by more than enough and the last page is lost.

 - If "size" is sufficiently small, it is wrapped around and gets
   a bogus value.
