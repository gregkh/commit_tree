kconfig: Fix warning "‘jump’ may be used uninitialized"

Warning:
In file included from scripts/kconfig/zconf.tab.c:2537:0:
scripts/kconfig/menu.c: In function ‘get_symbol_str’:
scripts/kconfig/menu.c:590:18: warning: ‘jump’ may be used uninitialized in this function [-Wmaybe-uninitialized]
     jump->offset = strlen(r->s);

Simplifies the test logic because (head && local) means (jump != 0)
and makes GCC happy when checking if the jump pointer was initialized.
