ALSA: usb-audio: Pass direct struct pointer instead of list_head

Some functions in mixer.c and endpoint.c receive list_head instead of
the object itself.  This is not obvious and rather error-prone.  Let's
pass the proper object directly instead.

The functions in midi.c still receive list_head and this can't be
changed since the object definition isn't exposed to the outside of
midi.c, so left as is.
