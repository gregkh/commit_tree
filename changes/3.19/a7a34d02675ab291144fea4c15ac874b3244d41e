storage: Revise/fix quirk for 04E6:000F SCM USB-SCSI converter

I recently posted a patch ("storage: Add quirk for another SCM-based
USB-SCSI converter") to add a quirk for the converter with ID 04E6:000F,
which is listed along with 04E6:000B in the Windows INF file for the
Startech ICUSBSCSI2 as "eUSB SCSI Adapter (Bus Powered)".

The already-present quirk for 04E6:000B has USB_SC_SCSI/USB_PR_BULK, not
USB_SC_DEVICE/USB_PR_DEVICE. Change the 04E6:000F quirk to match that,
since it will probably be required.
