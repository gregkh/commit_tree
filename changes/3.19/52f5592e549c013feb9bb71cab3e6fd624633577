fs/binfmt_elf.c: fix internal inconsistency relating to vma dump size

vma_dump_size() has been used several times on actual dumper and it is
supposed to return the same value for the same vma.  But vma_dump_size()
could return different values for same vma.

The known problem case is concurrent shared memory removal.  If a vma is
used for a shared memory and that shared memory is removed between
writing program header and dumping vma memory, this will result in a
dump file which is internally consistent.

To fix the problem, we set baseline to get dump size and store the size
into vma_filesz and always use the same vma dump size which is stored in
vma_filsz.  The consistnecy with reality is not actually guranteed, but
it's tolerable since that is fully consistent with base line.
