ACPI / video: update the skip case for acpi_video_device_in_dod()

If the firmware has declared more than 8 video output devices, and the
one that control the internal panel's backlight is listed after the
first 8 output devices, the _DOD will not include it due to the current
i915 operation region implementation. As a result, we will not create a
backlight device for it while we should. Solve this problem by special
case the firmware that has 8+ output devices in that if we see such a
firmware, we do not test if the device is in _DOD list. The creation of
the backlight device will also enable the firmware to emit events on
backlight hotkey press when the acpi_osi= cmdline option is specified on
those affected ASUS laptops.
