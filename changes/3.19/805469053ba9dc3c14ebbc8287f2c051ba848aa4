toshiba_acpi: Add keyboard backlight mode change event

A previous patch added support to handle more events.

This patch adds support to update the sysfs group whenever we receive
a 0x92 event, which indicates a change in the keyboard backlight mode,
removing the update group code from toshiba_kbd_bl_mode_store, as it is
no longer needed there.
