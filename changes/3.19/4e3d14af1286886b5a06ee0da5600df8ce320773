staging: comedi: cb_pcimdas: add support for PCIe-DAS1602/16

The Measurement Computing PCIe-DAS1602/16 is a PCI-Express version of
the PCIM-DAS1602/16, but has a different PCI device ID.  Add support
for this device and update the driver description, Kconfig description
and MODULE_DESCRIPTION.

Thanks to Christoph Langbein for supplying the PCI device ID.
