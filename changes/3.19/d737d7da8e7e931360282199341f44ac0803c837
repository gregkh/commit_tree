firewire: sbp2: replace card lock by target lock

firewire-core uses fw_card.lock to protect topology data and transaction
data.  firewire-sbp2 uses fw_card.lock for entirely unrelated purposes.

Introduce a sbp2_target.lock to firewire-sbp2 and replace all
fw_card.lock uses in the driver.  fw_card.lock is now entirely private
to firewire-core.  This has no immediate advantage apart from making it
clear in the code that firewire-sbp2 does not interact with the core
via the core lock.
