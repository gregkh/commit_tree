PCI: Remove PCI ioapic driver

To support IOAPIC hotplug on x86 and IA64 platforms, OS needs to figure
out global interrupt source number(GSI) and IOAPIC enumeration ID
through ACPI interfaces. So BIOS must implement an ACPI IOAPIC device
with _GSB/_UID or _MAT method to support IOAPIC hotplug. OS also needs
to figure out base physical address to access IOAPIC registers. OS may
get the base physical address through PCI BARs if IOAPIC device is
visible in PCI domain, otherwise OS may get the address by ACPI _CRS
method if IOAPIC device is hidden from PCI domain by BIOS.

When adding a PCI subtree, we need to add IOAPIC devices before enabling
all other PCI devices because other PCI devices may use the IOAPIC to
allocate PCI interrupts.

So we plan to reimplement IOAPIC driver as an ACPI instead of PCI driver
due to:
1) hot-pluggable IOAPIC devices are always visible in ACPI domain,
   but may or may not be visible in PCI domain.
2) we could explicitly control the order between IOAPIC and other PCI
   devices.

We also have another choice to use a PCI driver to manage IOAPIC device
if it's visible in PCI domain and use an ACPI driver if it's only
visible in ACPI domain. But this solution is a little complex.

It shouldn't cause serious backward compatibility issues because:
1) IOAPIC hotplug is never supported on x86 yet because it hasn't
   implemented the required acpi_register_ioapic() and
   acpi_unregister_ioapic().
2) Currently only ACPI based IOAPIC hotplug is possible on x86 and
   IA64, we don't know other specifications and interfaces to support
   IOAPIC hotplug yet.
3) We will reimplement an ACPI IOAPIC driver to support IOAPIC hotplug.

This change also helps to get rid of the false alarm on all current
Linux distributions:
[    6.952497] ioapic: probe of 0000:00:05.4 failed with error -22
[    6.959542] ioapic: probe of 0000:80:05.4 failed with error -22
