ARM: dts: Add micro SD card SDHCI node for exynos4412-trats

Add SDHCI node for supporting the micro SD card. On Trats2 board the
SDHCI does not use sd2_cd pins (gpk2-2) for card detect but gpx3-4
instead.

Power is supplied from LDO21 regulator which in off state is controlled
by external GPIO pin.
