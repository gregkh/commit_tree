scsi: split scsi_nonblockable_ioctl

The calling conventions for this function are bad as it could return
-ENODEV both for a device not currently online and a not recognized ioctl.

Add a new scsi_ioctl_block_when_processing_errors function that wraps
scsi_block_when_processing_errors with the a special case for the
SG_SCSI_RESET ioctl command, and handle the SG_SCSI_RESET case itself
in scsi_ioctl.  All callers of scsi_ioctl now must call the above helper
to check for the EH state, so that the ioctl handler itself doesn't
have to.
