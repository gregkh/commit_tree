cifs: use memzero_explicit to clear stack buffer

When leaving a function use memzero_explicit instead of memset(0) to
clear stack allocated buffers. memset(0) may be optimized away.

This particular buffer is highly likely to contain sensitive data which
we shouldn't leak (it's named 'passwd' after all).
