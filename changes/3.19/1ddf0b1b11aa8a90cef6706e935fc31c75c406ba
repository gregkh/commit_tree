x86, vdso: Use asm volatile in __getcpu

In Linux 3.18 and below, GCC hoists the lsl instructions in the
pvclock code all the way to the beginning of __vdso_clock_gettime,
slowing the non-paravirt case significantly.  For unknown reasons,
presumably related to the removal of a branch, the performance issue
is gone as of

e76b027e6408 x86,vdso: Use LSL unconditionally for vgetcpu

but I don't trust GCC enough to expect the problem to stay fixed.

There should be no correctness issue, because the __getcpu calls in
__vdso_vlock_gettime were never necessary in the first place.

Note to stable maintainers: In 3.18 and below, depending on
configuration, gcc 4.9.2 generates code like this:

     9c3:       44 0f 03 e8             lsl    %ax,%r13d
     9c7:       45 89 eb                mov    %r13d,%r11d
     9ca:       0f 03 d8                lsl    %ax,%ebx

This patch won't apply as is to any released kernel, but I'll send a
trivial backported version if needed.
