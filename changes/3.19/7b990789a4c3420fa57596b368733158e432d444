scripts/kernel-doc: don't eat struct members with __aligned

The change from \d+ to .+ inside __aligned() means that the following
structure:

  struct test {
        u8 a __aligned(2);
        u8 b __aligned(2);
  };

essentially gets modified to

  struct test {
        u8 a;
  };

for purposes of kernel-doc, thus dropping a struct member, which in
turns causes warnings and invalid kernel-doc generation.

Fix this by replacing the catch-all (".") with anything that's not a
semicolon ("[^;]").
