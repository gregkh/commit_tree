gpio: fix gpio-chip list corruption

Fix potential corruption of gpio-chip list due to failure to remove the
chip from the list before returning in gpiochip_add error path.

The chip could be long gone when the global list is next traversed,
something which could lead to a null-pointer dereference. In the best
case (chip not deallocated) we are just leaking the gpio range.
