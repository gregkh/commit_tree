ext4: introduce aging to extent status tree

Introduce a simple aging to extent status tree. Each extent has a
REFERENCED bit which gets set when the extent is used. Shrinker then
skips entries with referenced bit set and clears the bit. Thus
frequently used extents have higher chances of staying in memory.
