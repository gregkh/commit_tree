arm/arm64: KVM: Turn off vcpus on PSCI shutdown/reboot

When a vcpu calls SYSTEM_OFF or SYSTEM_RESET with PSCI v0.2, the vcpus
should really be turned off for the VM adhering to the suggestions in
the PSCI spec, and it's the sane thing to do.

Also, clarify the behavior and expectations for exits to user space with
the KVM_EXIT_SYSTEM_EVENT case.
