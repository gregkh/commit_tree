ceph: introduce a new inode flag indicating if cached dentries are ordered

After creating/deleting/renaming file, offsets of sibling dentries may
change. So we can not use cached dentries to satisfy readdir. But we can
still use the cached dentries to conclude -ENOENT for lookup.

This patch introduces a new inode flag indicating if child dentries are
ordered. The flag is set at the same time marking a directory complete.
After creating/deleting/renaming file, we clear the flag on directory
inode. This prevents ceph_readdir() from using cached dentries to satisfy
readdir syscall.
