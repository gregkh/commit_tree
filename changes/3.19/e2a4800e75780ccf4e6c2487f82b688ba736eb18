ppp: deflate: never return len larger than output buffer

When we've run out of space in the output buffer to store more data, we
will call zlib_deflate with a NULL output buffer until we've consumed
remaining input.

When this happens, olen contains the size the output buffer would have
consumed iff we'd have had enough room.

This can later cause skb_over_panic when ppp_generic skb_put()s
the returned length.
