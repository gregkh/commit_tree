crypto: add missing crypto module aliases

Commit 5d26a105b5a7 ("crypto: prefix module autoloading with "crypto-"")
changed the automatic module loading when requesting crypto algorithms
to prefix all module requests with "crypto-". This requires all crypto
modules to have a crypto specific module alias even if their file name
would otherwise match the requested crypto algorithm.

Even though commit 5d26a105b5a7 added those aliases for a vast amount of
modules, it was missing a few. Add the required MODULE_ALIAS_CRYPTO
annotations to those files to make them get loaded automatically, again.
This fixes, e.g., requesting 'ecb(blowfish-generic)', which used to work
with kernels v3.18 and below.

Also change MODULE_ALIAS() lines to MODULE_ALIAS_CRYPTO(). The former
won't work for crypto modules any more.
