hangcheck-timer: cleanup casting in hangcheck_init()

The 32 bit addition "(hangcheck_margin + hangcheck_tick)" could
potentially overflow.  It triggers a static checker warning to have an
overflowed addition followed by a no-op cast.  I have moved the cast so
that the addition can't overflow.

Also I removed the unneeded cast on the following line since both
"hangcheck_tsc_margin" and "TIMER_FREQ" are already 64 bit types.
