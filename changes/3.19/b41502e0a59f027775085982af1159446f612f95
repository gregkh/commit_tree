ARM: dts: dra7-evm: Add CAN support

The board has 2 CAN ports but only the first one can be used.
Enable the first CAN port.

WAKEUP0 pin doesn't have INPUT enable bit so we just disable
weak PULLs.

The second CAN port cannot be used without hardware modification
so we don't enable the second port.
