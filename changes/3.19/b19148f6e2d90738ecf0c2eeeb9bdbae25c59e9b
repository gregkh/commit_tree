s390/pci: improve irq number check for msix

s390s arch_setup_msi_irqs function ensures that we don't return with
more irqs than the PCI architecture allows and that a single PCI
function doesn't consume more irqs than the kernel is configured for.

At least the last check doesn't help much and should take the sum of
all irqs into account. Since that's already done by irq_alloc_desc
we can remove this check.

As for the first check we should use the value provided by the
firmware which can be less than what the PCI architecture allows.
