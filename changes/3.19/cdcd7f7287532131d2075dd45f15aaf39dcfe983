ASoC: wm_adsp: Use vmalloc to allocate firmware download buffer

Use vmalloc to allocate the buffer for firmware/coefficient download and
rely on the SPI core to split this up into DMA-able chunks. This should
give better performance and means we no longer need to manually split
the download into page size chunks to avoid allocating overly large
continuous memory regions.
