arm64: fix missing asm/io.h include in kernel/smp_spin_table.c

On next-20150105, defconfig compilation breaks with:

arch/arm64/kernel/smp_spin_table.c:80:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘ioremap_cache’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
arch/arm64/kernel/smp_spin_table.c:92:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘writeq_relaxed’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
arch/arm64/kernel/smp_spin_table.c:101:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘iounmap’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

Fix by including asm/io.h, which contains definitions or prototypes
for these macros or functions.

This second version incorporates a comment from Mark Rutland
<mark.rutland@arm.com> to keep the includes in alphabetical order
by filename.
