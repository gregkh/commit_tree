[media] coda: try to only queue a single JPEG into the bitstream

With bitstream padding, it is possible to decode a single JPEG in the bitstream
immediately. This allows us to only ever queue a single JPEG into the bitstream
buffer, except to increase payload over 512 bytes or to back out of hold state.
This is a measure to decrease JPEG decoder latency.
