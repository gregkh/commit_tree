geneve: Fix races between socket add and release.

Currently, searching for a socket to add a reference to is not
synchronized with deletion of sockets. This can result in use
after free if there is another operation that is removing a
socket at the same time. Solving this requires both holding the
appropriate lock and checking the refcount to ensure that it
has not already hit zero.

Inspired by a related (but not exactly the same) issue in the
VXLAN driver.
