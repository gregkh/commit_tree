x86, MCE, AMD: Drop software-defined bank in error thresholding

Aravind had the good question about why we're assigning a
software-defined bank when reporting error thresholding errors instead
of simply using the bank which reports the last error causing the
overflow.

Digging through git history, it pointed to

95268664390b ("[PATCH] x86_64: mce_amd support for family 0x10 processors")

which added that functionality. The problem with this, however, is that
tools don't know about software-defined banks and get puzzled. So drop
that K8_MCE_THRESHOLD_BASE and simply use the hw bank reporting the
thresholding interrupt.

Save us a couple of MSR reads while at it.
