dmaengine: qcom_bam_dma: Add BAM v1.3.0 support

We currently have register offset information only for BAM IPs with revision
1.4.0. We add register offset table entries for the legacy (v1.3.0) version
of BAM IPs found on SoCs like APQ8064 and MSM8960.

The register offset table pointers are stored in DT data corresponding to the
BAM IP version specified in the compatible string.
