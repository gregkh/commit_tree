tracing / PM: Replace CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME with CONFIG_PM

After commit b2b49ccbdd54 (PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if PM_SLEEP is
selected) PM_RUNTIME is always set if PM is set, so files that are
build conditionally if CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is set may now be build
if CONFIG_PM is set.

Replace CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME with CONFIG_PM in kernel/trace/Makefile
for this reason.
