lustre: Deletion of unnecessary checks before three function calls

The functions free_ll_remote_perm(), free_rmtperm_hash() and iput() test
whether their argument is NULL and then return immediately.
Thus the test around their calls is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
