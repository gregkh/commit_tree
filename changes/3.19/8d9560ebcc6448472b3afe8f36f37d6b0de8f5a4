Drivers: hv: kvp,vss: Fast propagation of userspace communication failure

If we fail to send a message to userspace daemon with cn_netlink_send()
there is no need to wait for userspace to reply as it is not going to
happen. This happens when kvp or vss daemon is stopped after a successful
handshake. Report HV_E_FAIL immediately and cancel the timeout job so
host won't receive two failures.
Use pr_warn() for VSS and pr_debug() for KVP deliberately as VSS request
are rare and result in a failed backup. KVP requests are much more frequent
after a successful handshake so avoid flooding logs. It would be nice to
have an ability to de-negotiate with the host in case userspace daemon gets
disconnected so we won't receive new requests. But I'm not sure it is
possible.
