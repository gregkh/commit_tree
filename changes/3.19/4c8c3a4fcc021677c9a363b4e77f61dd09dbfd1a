ALSA: usb-audio: Flatten probe and disconnect functions

The usb-audio probe and disconnect functions have been split just for
adapting the (new!) API at 2.5 kernel time.  We left them until now,
partly because we wanted to build with the pretty old kernels in the
external alsa-driver tree.  But the support of such old kernels has
been longly stopped, so it's good time to clean up this mess.

One good point by this cleanup is that now the probe function returns
a proper error code instead of only -EIO.
