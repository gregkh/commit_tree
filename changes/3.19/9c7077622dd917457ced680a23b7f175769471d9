packet: make packet_snd fail on len smaller than l2 header

When sending packets out with PF_PACKET, SOCK_RAW, ensure that the
packet is at least as long as the device's expected link layer header.
This check already exists in tpacket_snd, but not in packet_snd.
Also rate limit the warning in tpacket_snd.
