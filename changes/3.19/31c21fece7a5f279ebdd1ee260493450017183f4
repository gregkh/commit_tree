amdkfd: Add module parameter of scheduling policy

This patch adds a new parameter to the amdkfd driver. This parameter enables
the user to select the scheduling policy of the CP. The choices are:

* CP Scheduling with support for over-subscription
* CP Scheduling without support for over-subscription
* Without CP Scheduling

Note that the third option (Without CP scheduling) is only for debug purposes
and bringup of new H/W. As such, it is _not_ guaranteed to work at all times on
all H/W versions.

v3: Fixed description of parameter, changed the permissions to read_only, added
a verification of the value and added documentation

v5: Set default sched_policy to HWS as it is now supported by firmware
