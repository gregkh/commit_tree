ethernet/realtek: use napi_alloc_skb instead of netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align

This replaces most of the calls to netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align in the Realtek
drivers.  The one instance I didn't replace in 8139cp.c is because it was
called as a part of init and as such is not always accessed from the
softirq context.
