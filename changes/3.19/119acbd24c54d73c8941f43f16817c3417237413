ARM: 8217/1: sa1100 collie: use gpio-charger instead of pda-power

Use gpio-charger driver instead of pda-power: it automatically cares
about used gpio and since collie does not differentiate between usb and
ac chargers, pda-power is an overkill for it.

As a bonus this allows us to remove gpio_to_irq calls from machine init
call - it is fragile. These gpio_to_irq calls will fail if gpios are
registered later, via device driver mechanisms.
