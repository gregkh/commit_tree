gpio: Support for unified device properties interface

Some drivers need to deal with only firmware representation of its
GPIOs. An example would be a GPIO button array driver where each button
is described as a separate firmware node in device tree. Typically these
child nodes do not have physical representation in the Linux device
model.

In order to help device drivers to handle such firmware child nodes we
add dev[m]_get_named_gpiod_from_child() that takes a child firmware
node pointer as its second argument (the first one is the parent device
itself), finds the GPIO using whatever is the underlying firmware
method, and requests the GPIO properly.
