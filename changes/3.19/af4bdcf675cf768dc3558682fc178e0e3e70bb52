perf/x86/intel: Disallow flags for most Core2/Atom/Nehalem/Westmere events

Disallow setting inv/cmask/etc. flags for all PEBS events
on these CPUs, except for the UOPS_RETIRED.* events on Nehalem/Westmere,
which are needed for cycles:p. This avoids an undefined situation
strongly discouraged by the Intle SDM. The PLD_* events were already
covered. This follows the earlier changes for Sandy Bridge and alter.
