drm/exynos: Fix DSI resuming fail because power domain being off

During system resume from suspend to RAM the Exynos DRM driver forced
CRTC mode thus turning display on (DPMS_ON). This lead to runtime resuming
of DSI which failed because whole LCD power domain was off and it was
not allowed to turn on because of system resume in progress.

Forcing mode should not be needed and removing it solves this particular
problem.

This necessary fix for following scenario reproduced on Exynos DRM:
1. Power domain is off before suspending the system.
2. System is suspended to RAM.
3. Resuming starts. The Exynos DRM driver resume callback is called.
4. The Exynos DRM driver calls drm_helper_resume_force_mode() which turns
   on the screen by calling exynos_dsi_dpms with DRM_MODE_DPMS_ON.
5. The Exynos DSI driver calls pm_runtime_get. The driver runtime
   resumes and this should turn LCD power domain on.
6. Unfortunately the domain cannot be turned on because system resume is
   in progress and genpd->prepared_count is positive.

Steps to reproduce:
1. Add runtime PM to Exynos DSI driver.
2. Build Exynos DRM/FB without FRAMEBUFFER_CONSOLE.
3. Enable the connector and screen (e.g. with modeset-vsync).
4. echo 3 > /sys/devices/platform/exynos-drm/graphics/fb0/blank
5. echo mem > /sys/power/state
6. Resume.
