arm/arm64: KVM: Use set/way op trapping to track the state of the caches

Trying to emulate the behaviour of set/way cache ops is fairly
pointless, as there are too many ways we can end-up missing stuff.
Also, there is some system caches out there that simply ignore
set/way operations.

So instead of trying to implement them, let's convert it to VA ops,
and use them as a way to re-enable the trapping of VM ops. That way,
we can detect the point when the MMU/caches are turned off, and do
a full VM flush (which is what the guest was trying to do anyway).

This allows a 32bit zImage to boot on the APM thingy, and will
probably help bootloaders in general.
