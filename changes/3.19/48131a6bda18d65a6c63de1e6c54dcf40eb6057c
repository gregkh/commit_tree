staging: gdm724x: Fix incorrect type in assignment

This patch fixes following sparse warnings:
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:389:32: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:389:32:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] start_flag
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:389:32:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:390:29: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:390:29:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] seq_num
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:390:29:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:391:34: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:391:34:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] payload_size
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:391:34:    got restricted __le32 [usertype] <noident>
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:392:33: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:392:33:    expected unsigned short [unsigned] packet_type
drivers/staging/gdm724x/gdm_mux.c:392:33:    got restricted __le16 [usertype] <noident>

Sparse found above warnings, so this patch changes variable types of
structs. Because expected and got variable types are different.
