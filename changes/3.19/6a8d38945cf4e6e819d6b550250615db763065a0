binfmt_elf: Hoist ELF program header loading to a function

load_elf_binary & load_elf_interp both load program headers from an ELF
executable in the same way, duplicating the code. This patch introduces
a helper function (load_elf_phdrs) which performs this common task &
calls it from both load_elf_binary & load_elf_interp. In addition to
reducing code duplication, this is part of preparing to load the ELF
interpreter headers earlier such that they can be examined before it's
too late to return an error from an exec syscall.
