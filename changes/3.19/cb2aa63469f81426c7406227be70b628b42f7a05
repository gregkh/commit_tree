time: Fix sign bug in NTP mult overflow warning

In commit 6067dc5a8c2b ("time: Avoid possible NTP adjustment
mult overflow") a new check was added to watch for adjustments
that could cause a mult overflow.

Unfortunately the check compares a signed with unsigned value
and ignored the case where the adjustment was negative, which
causes spurious warn-ons on some systems (and seems like it
would result in problematic time adjustments there as well, due
to the early return).

Thus this patch adds a check to make sure the adjustment is
positive before we check for an overflow, and resovles the issue
in my testing.
