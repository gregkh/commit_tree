ASoC: wm8523: Cleanup manual bias level transitions

Set the CODEC driver's suspend_bias_off flag rather than manually going to
SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF in suspend and SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY in resume. This makes
the code a bit shorter and cleaner.

Since the ASoC core now takes care of setting the bias level to
SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF when removing the CODEC there is no need to do it manually
anymore either.

The manual transition to SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY at the end of CODEC probe()
can also be removed as the core will automatically do this after the CODEC
has been probed.
