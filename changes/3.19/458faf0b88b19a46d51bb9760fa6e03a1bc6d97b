tracing: Kill the dead code in probe_sched_switch() and probe_sched_wakeup()

After the previous patch it is clear that "tracer_enabled" can never be
true, we can remove the "if (tracer_enabled)" code in probe_sched_switch()
and probe_sched_wakeup(). Plus we can obviously remove tracer_enabled,
ctx_trace, and sched_stopped as well.
