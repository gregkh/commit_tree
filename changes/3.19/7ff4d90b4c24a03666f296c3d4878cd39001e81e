groups: Consolidate the setgroups permission checks

Today there are 3 instances of setgroups and due to an oversight their
permission checking has diverged.  Add a common function so that
they may all share the same permission checking code.

This corrects the current oversight in the current permission checks
and adds a helper to avoid this in the future.

A user namespace security fix will update this new helper, shortly.
