ext4: cache extent hole in extent status tree for ext4_da_map_blocks()

Currently extent status tree doesn't cache extent hole when a write
looks up in extent tree to make sure whether a block has been allocated
or not.  In this case, we don't put extent hole in extent cache because
later this extent might be removed and a new delayed extent might be
added back.  But it will cause a defect when we do a lot of writes.  If
we don't put extent hole in extent cache, the following writes also need
to access extent tree to look at whether or not a block has been
allocated.  It brings a cache miss.  This commit fixes this defect.
Also if the inode doesn't have any extent, this extent hole will be
cached as well.
