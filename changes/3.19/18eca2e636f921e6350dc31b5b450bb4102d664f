mm: memcontrol: remove unnecessary PCG_MEMSW memory+swap charge flag

Now that mem_cgroup_swapout() fully uncharges the page, every page that is
still in use when reaching mem_cgroup_uncharge() is known to carry both
the memory and the memory+swap charge.  Simplify the uncharge path and
remove the PCG_MEMSW page flag accordingly.
