of: check for size < 0 after rounding in early_init_dt_add_memory_arch

Memory regions passed to early_init_dt_add_memory_arch() are rounded to
PAGE_SIZE by subtracting the size of the leading fractional page from
the 'size' argument. However, size being a u64 type, if its value is
sufficiently small, the subtraction wraps around and produces a bogus
value, potentially leading to crashes.

Fix this by ignoring the memory range in such cases.
