arm: mvebu: normalize pinctrl entries for Armada SoCs

There are currently 2 differents naming conventions used between the
existing Armada SoC DT files for pinctrl entries (*_pin(s): *-pin(s)
and pmx_*: pmx-*) with a vast majority of files using the former:

$ grep _pin arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-*.dts* | wc -l
155
$ grep pmx arch/arm/boot/dts/armada-*.dts* | wc -l
13

In fact, only some Armada XP files are using the second variant.
This patch normalizes those files (mainly ge0/1 entries) to use
the first variant.
