[media] em28xx: checkpatch cleanup: whitespaces/new lines cleanups

This patch is basically produced while testing a tool that
Joe Perches sent upstream sometime ago:
	https://lkml.org/lkml/2014/7/11/794

I used it with those arguments:
	$ reformat_with_checkpatch.sh drivers/media/usb/em28xx/em28xx*.[ch]

It actually produced 24 patches, with is too much, and showed
interesting things: gcc produced different codes on most of the
patches, even with just linespace changes. The total code data
remained the same on all cases I checked though.

Anyway, provided that we fold the resulting patches, this tool
seems useful.
