ASoC: ts3a227e: Check and report jack status at probe

ts3a227e does not trigger interrupt to report jack status when system
boots from warm reset because ts3a227e's power remains on during warm reset.
Read jack status at probe to get current jack status.
Note that if system boots from EC reset, then this issue will not
happen.
