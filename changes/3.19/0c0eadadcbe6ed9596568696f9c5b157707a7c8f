staging: comedi: dmm32at: introduce dmm32_ai_get_sample()

Introduce a helper function to read the two's complement analog input
sample from the hardware and munge it to the offset binary (unsigned)
format that comedi expects. Use the comedi_offset_munge() helper to
munge the data.

Use the new helper in the analog input (*insn_read) and in the interrupt
handler for the async command.
