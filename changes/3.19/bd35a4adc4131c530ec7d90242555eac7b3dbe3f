arm64: Port SWP/SWPB emulation support from arm

The SWP instruction was deprecated in the ARMv6 architecture. The
ARMv7 multiprocessing extensions mandate that SWP/SWPB instructions
are treated as undefined from reset, with the ability to enable them
through the System Control Register SW bit. With ARMv8, the option to
enable these instructions through System Control Register was dropped
as well.

To support legacy applications using these instructions, port the
emulation of the SWP and SWPB instructions from the arm port to arm64.
