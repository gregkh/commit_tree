ASoC: soc-pcm: do not hw_free BE if it's still used

Do not free BE hw if it's still used by other FE during dpcm runtime
shutdown. Otherwise the BE runtime state will be STATE_HW_FREE and
won't be updated to STATE_CLOSE when shutdown ends, because BE dai
shutdown function won't close pcm when detecting BE is still under
use. With STATE_HW_FREE, BE can't be triggered start again.

This corner case can easily appear when one BE is used by two FE,
without this patch "ASoC: dpcm: Fix race between FE/BE updates and
trigger"(ea9d0d771fcd32cd56070819749477d511ec9117). One FE tries to
shutdown but it's raced against xrun on another FE. It improves the
be dai hw_free logic.
