ACPI/int340x_thermal: enumerate INT340X devices even if they're not in _ART/_TRT

For some INT340X thermal devices, even if they are not referred in
_TRT/_ART table, they still can be used by userspace for thermal control.
Thus change the code to enumerated all the INT340X devices,
no matter if they're referred in _TRT/_ART or not.
