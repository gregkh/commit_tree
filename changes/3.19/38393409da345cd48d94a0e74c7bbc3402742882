PM / OPP mark OPPs as 'static' or 'dynamic'

Static OPPs are the ones created from Device Tree entries and dynamic are the
ones created at runtime by calling dev_pm_opp_add().

There is a need to distinguish them as we need to free static OPPs from cpufreq
drivers when they are removed.

So, add another field 'dynamic' in 'struct dev_pm_opp' to keep this information.
