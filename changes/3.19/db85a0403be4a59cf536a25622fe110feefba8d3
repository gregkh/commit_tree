[media] omap24xx/tcm825x: remove deprecated omap2 camera drivers.

The omap2 camera driver and the tcm825x sensor driver have been
deprecated for a year and are now being removed. They are unmaintained
and they use an internal API that has long since been superseded by a
much better API. Worse, that internal API has been abused by out-of-kernel
trees (i.MX6).

In addition, Sakari stated that these drivers have never been in a
usable state in the mainline kernel due to missing platform data.
