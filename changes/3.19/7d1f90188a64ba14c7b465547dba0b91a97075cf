MAINTAINERS: drop DT regex matching on of_get_property and of_match_table

The regex matching on of_get_property and of_match_table cause Grant and
me to be copied on loads of drivers as well as be listed as maintainers
of those drivers. I believe the intent here was to check for documenting
of properties, but that has proven horribly ineffective. checkpatch now
at least partially covers this checking compatible strings. So remove
these regex's to reduce the firehose somewhat.
