memcg: turn memcg_kmem_skip_account into a bit field

It isn't supposed to stack, so turn it into a bit-field to save 4 bytes on
the task_struct.

Also, remove the memcg_stop/resume_kmem_account helpers - it is clearer to
set/clear the flag inline.  Regarding the overwhelming comment to the
helpers, which is removed by this patch too, we already have a compact yet
accurate explanation in memcg_schedule_cache_create, no need in yet
another one.
