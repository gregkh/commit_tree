genetlink: A genl_bind() to an out-of-range multicast group should not WARN().

Users can request to bind to arbitrary multicast groups, so warning
when the requested group number is out of range is not appropriate.

And with the warning removed, and the 'err' variable properly given
an initial value, we can remove 'found' altogether.
