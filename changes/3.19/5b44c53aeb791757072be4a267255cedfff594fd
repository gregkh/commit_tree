HID: i2c-hid: Do not free buffers in i2c_hid_stop()

When a hid driver that uses i2c-hid as transport is unloaded, the hid core
will call i2c_hid_stop() which releases all the buffers associated with the
device. This includes also the command buffer.

Now, when the i2c-hid driver itself is unloaded it tries to power down the
device by sending it PWR_SLEEP command. Since the command buffer is already
released we get following crash:

Fix this so that we only free buffers when the i2c-hid driver itself is
removed.
