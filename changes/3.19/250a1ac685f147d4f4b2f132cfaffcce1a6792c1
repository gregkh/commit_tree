x86, smpboot: Remove pointless preempt_disable() in native_smp_prepare_cpus()

There is no reason to keep preemption disabled in this function.

We only have two other threads live: kthreadd and idle. Neither of
them is going to preempt. But that preempt_disable forces all the code
inside to do GFP_ATOMIC allocations which is just insane.

Remove it.
