fuse: flush requests on umount

Use fuse_abort_conn() instead of fuse_conn_kill() in fuse_put_super().
This flushes and aborts requests still on any queues.  But since we've
already reset fc->connected, those requests would not be useful anyway and
would be flushed when the fuse device is closed.

Next patches will rely on requests being flushed before the superblock is
destroyed.

Use fuse_abort_conn() in cuse_process_init_reply() too, since it makes no
difference there, and we can get rid of fuse_conn_kill().
