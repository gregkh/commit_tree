xen: Speed up set_phys_to_machine() by using read-only mappings

Instead of checking at each call of set_phys_to_machine() whether a
new p2m page has to be allocated due to writing an entry in a large
invalid or identity area, just map those areas read only and react
to a page fault on write by allocating the new page.

This change will make the common path with no allocation much
faster as it only requires a single write of the new mfn instead
of walking the address translation tables and checking for the
special cases.
