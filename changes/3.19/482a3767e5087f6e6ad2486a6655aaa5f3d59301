exit: reparent: call forget_original_parent() under tasklist_lock

Shift "release dead children" loop from forget_original_parent() to its
caller, exit_notify().  It is safe to reap them even if our parent reaps
us right after we drop tasklist_lock, those children no longer have any
connection to the exiting task.

And this allows us to avoid write_lock_irq(tasklist_lock) right after it
was released by forget_original_parent(), we can simply call it with
tasklist_lock held.

While at it, move the comment about forget_original_parent() up to
this function.
