LOCKD: Fix a race when initialising nlmsvc_timeout

This commit fixes a race whereby nlmclnt_init() first starts the lockd
daemon, and then calls nlm_bind_host() with the expectation that
nlmsvc_timeout has already been initialised. Unfortunately, there is no
no synchronisation between lockd() and lockd_up() to guarantee that this
is the case.

Fix is to move the initialisation of nlmsvc_timeout into lockd_create_svc
