genetlink: pass only network namespace to genl_has_listeners()

There's no point to force the caller to know about the internal
genl_sock to use inside struct net, just have them pass the network
namespace. This doesn't really change code generation since it's
an inline, but makes the caller less magic - there's never any
reason to pass another socket.
