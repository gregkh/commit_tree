net: sctp: keep owned chunk in destructor_arg instead of skb->cb

It's just silly to hold the skb destructor argument around inside
skb->cb[] as we currently do in SCTP.

Nowadays, we're sort of cheating on data accounting in the sense
that due to commit 4c3a5bdae293 ("sctp: Don't charge for data in
sndbuf again when transmitting packet"), we orphan the skb already
in the SCTP output path, i.e. giving back charged data memory, and
use a different destructor only to make sure the sk doesn't vanish
on skb destruction time. Thus, cb[] is still valid here as we
operate within the SCTP layer. (It's generally actually a big
candidate for future rework, imho.)

However, storing the destructor in the cb[] can easily cause issues
should an non sctp_packet_set_owner_w()'ed skb ever escape the SCTP
layer, since cb[] may get overwritten by lower layers and thus can
corrupt the chunk pointer. There are no such issues at present,
but lets keep the chunk in destructor_arg, as this is the actual
purpose for it.
