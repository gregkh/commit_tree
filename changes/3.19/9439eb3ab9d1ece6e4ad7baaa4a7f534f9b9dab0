asm-generic: io: implement relaxed accessor macros as conditional wrappers

{read,write}{b,w,l,q}_relaxed are implemented by some architectures in
order to permit memory-mapped I/O accesses with weaker barrier semantics
than the non-relaxed variants.

This patch adds wrappers to asm-generic so that drivers can rely on the
relaxed accessors being available, even if they don't always provide
weaker ordering guarantees. Since some architectures both include
asm-generic/io.h and define some relaxed accessors, the definitions here
are conditional for the time being.
