IB/core: Temporarily disable ex_query_device uverb

Commit 5a77abf9a97a ("IB/core: Add support for extended query device caps")
added a new extended verb to query the capabilities of RDMA devices, but the
semantics of this verb are still under debate [1].

Don't expose this verb to userspace until the ABI is nailed down.
