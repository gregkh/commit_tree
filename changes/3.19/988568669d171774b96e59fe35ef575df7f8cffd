cfg80211: Specify frame and reason code for NL80211_CMD_DEL_STATION

The optional NL80211_ATTR_MGMT_SUBTYPE and NL80211_ATTR_REASON_CODE
attributes can now be included in NL80211_CMD_DEL_STATION to indicate to
the driver which frame (Deauthentication/Disassociation) and reason code
in that frame should be used to indicate removal to the specific
station. This is used by drivers that implement AP SME and generate
those frames internally.
