sh_eth: Fix ethtool operation crash when net device is down

The driver connects and disconnects the PHY device whenever the
net device is brought up and down.  The ethtool get_settings,
set_settings and nway_reset operations will dereference a null
or dangling pointer if called while it is down.

I think it would be preferable to keep the PHY connected, but there
may be good reasons not to.

As an immediate fix for this bug:
- Set the phydev pointer to NULL after disconnecting the PHY
- Change those three operations to return -ENODEV while the PHY is
  not connected
