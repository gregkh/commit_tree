ACPI / scan: Change the level of _DEP-related messages to KERN_DEBUG

Two _DEP-related failure messages are printed as dev_err() which is
unnecessary and annoying.  Use dev_dbg() to print them.

While at it, one of the messages should actually say it is related
to _DEP, so modify it to that effect.

Fixes: 40e7fcb19293 (ACPI: Add _DEP support to fix battery issue on Asus T100TA)
