Btrfs: ensure deletion from pinned_chunks list is protected

The call to remove_extent_mapping() actually deletes the extent map
from the list it's included in - fs_info->pinned_chunks - and that
list is protected by the chunk mutex. Therefore make that call
while holding the chunk mutex and remove the redundant list delete
call because it's a noop.

This fixes an overlook of the patch titled
"Btrfs: fix race between fs trimming and block group remove/allocation"
following the same obvervation from the patch titled
"Btrfs: fix unprotected deletion from pending_chunks list".
