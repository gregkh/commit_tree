bnx2x: Use correct fastpath version for VFs.

Our FW can support several fastpath HSI [for backward compatibility] but up
until now VFs were always configured to use latest fastpath HSI [although VF
driver might be older and use an older fastpath HSI].

For linux drivers, the differences are insignificant since driver never
utilized features that were overridden by the HSI change. But for VMs running
other operating systems this might be a problem.
In addition, eventually FW might change fastpath HSI in such a manner that
backward compatibility WILL break unless configured with proper version.

This patch fixes the issue for other operating system VMs, as well as lays
the ground work for forward compatibility in regard to the fastpath HSI.
