KVM: x86: Fix far-jump to non-canonical check

Commit d1442d85cc30 ("KVM: x86: Handle errors when RIP is set during far
jumps") introduced a bug that caused the fix to be incomplete.  Due to
incorrect evaluation, far jump to segment with L bit cleared (i.e., 32-bit
segment) and RIP with any of the high bits set (i.e, RIP[63:32] != 0) set may
not trigger #GP.  As we know, this imposes a security problem.

In addition, the condition for two warnings was incorrect.
