staging: octeon-ethernet: disable load balance for receiving packet when CONFIG_RPS is enabled.

It's better disable load balance for receiving packet when CONFIG_RPS is enabled.
If not, octeon-ethernet driver select CPU and then the rps select again CPU.
It can be ipi interrupts overhead and packet reordering could be possible.
