ARM: EXYNOS: Remove unused static iomapping

This patch removes all unused static iomapping from exynos4/5_iodesc
table, and at the same time removes related macros from mach/map.h and
plat/map-s5p.h. All such mappings are present in exynos.c but not
currently there are no users of these mappings, so it is safe to remove
these.
