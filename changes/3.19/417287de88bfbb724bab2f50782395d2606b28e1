Bluetooth: Fix check for support for page scan related commands

The Read Page Scan Activity and Read Page Scan Type commands are not
supported by all controllers. Move the execution of both commands
into the 3rd phase of the init procedure. And then check the bit
mask of supported commands before adding them to the init sequence.

With this re-ordering of the init sequence, the extra check for
AVM BlueFritz! controllers is no longer needed. They will report
that these two commands are not supported.

This fixes an issue with the Microsoft Corp. Wireless Transceiver
for Bluetooth 2.0 (ID 045e:009c).
