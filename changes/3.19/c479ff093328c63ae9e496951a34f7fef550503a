gpio: sch: Consolidate core and resume banks

This is actually a single device with two sets of identical registers,
which just happen to start from a different offset. Instead of having
separate GPIO chips created we consolidate them to be single GPIO chip.

In addition having a single GPIO chip allows us to handle ACPI GPIO
translation in the core in a more generic way, since the two GPIO chips
share the same parent ACPI device.
