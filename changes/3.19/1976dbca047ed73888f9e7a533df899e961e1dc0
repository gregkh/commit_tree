drm/panel: Add Sharp LQ101R1SX01 support

This panel requires dual-channel mode. The device accepts command-mode
data on 8 lanes and will therefore need a dual-channel DSI controller.
The two interfaces that make up this device need to be instantiated in
the controllers that gang up to provide the dual-channel DSI host.
