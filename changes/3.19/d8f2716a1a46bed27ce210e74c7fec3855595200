    drm/i915: ban badly behaving contexts

Without this real gpu hangs only log output at info level, which gets
filtered away by piglit's testrunner.

v2: Tune down to notice level. Note that we need to add drm/i915 so
that at least the automatic igt dmesg filtering still picks it up.

v3: git add and lack of coffee don't mix well.

v4: Message is in between hw and sw reset, so switch verb to
continuous form.

v5: Use i915_stop_rings_allow_warn for consistency. For Chris' case of
injecting lots of hangs I guess we need to revamp this all anyway when
merging. For now this should plug the regression for piglit testing
mesa.

v6: Make it compile (Mika).
