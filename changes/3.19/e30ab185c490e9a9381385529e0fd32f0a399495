x86, tls, ldt: Stop checking lm in LDT_empty

32-bit programs don't have an lm bit in their ABI, so they can't
reliably cause LDT_empty to return true without resorting to memset.
They shouldn't need to do this.

This should fix a longstanding, if minor, issue in all 64-bit kernels
as well as a potential regression in the TLS hardening code.
