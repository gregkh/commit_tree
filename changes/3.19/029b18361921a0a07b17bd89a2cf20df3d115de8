Input: uinput - fix ioctl nr overflow for UI_GET_SYSNAME/VERSION

Request number for ioctls are encoded as 8bit numbers, but unfortunately
UI_GET_SYSNAME and UI_GET_VERSION specifu values larger than that, so they
get truncated to 44 (0x2c) and 45 (0x2d). This change makes requested
values match their effective values (the ABI stays intact).
