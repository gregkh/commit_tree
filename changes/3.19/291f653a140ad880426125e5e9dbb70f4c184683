core: platform: let platform_create_bundle initialize module owner

Since commit 9447057eaff8 ("platform_device: use a macro instead of
platform_driver_register"), platform_driver_register() always overwrites
the .owner field of a platform_driver with THIS_MODULE. This breaks
platform_create_bundle() which uses it via platform_driver_probe() from
within the platform core instead of the module init. Fix it by using a
similar #define construct to obtain THIS_MODULE and pass it on later.
