tcp: move sk_mark_napi_id() at the right place

sk_mark_napi_id() is used to record for a flow napi id of incoming
packets for busypoll sake.
We should do this only on established flows, not on listeners.

This was 'working' by virtue of the socket cloning, but doing
this on SYN packets in unecessary cache line dirtying.

Even if we move sk_napi_id in the same cache line than sk_lock,
we are working to make SYN processing lockless, so it is desirable
to set sk_napi_id only for established flows.
