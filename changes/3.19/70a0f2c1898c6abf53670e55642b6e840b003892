scsi: ->queue_rq can't sleep

The blk-mq ->queue_rq method is always called from process context,
but might have preemption disabled.  This means we still always
have to use GFP_ATOMIC for memory allocations, and thus need to
revert part of commit 3c356bde1 ("scsi: stop passing a gfp_mask
argument down the command setup path").
