spi: spidev: Don't mangle max_speed_hz in underlying spi device

Currently spidev allows callers to set the default speed by overriding the
max_speed_hz in the underlying device. This achieves the immediate goal but
is not what devices expect and can easily lead to userspace trying to set
unsupported speeds and succeeding, apart from anything else drivers can't
set a limit on the speed using max_speed_hz as they'd expect and any other
devices on the bus will be affected.

Instead store the default speed in the spidev struct and fill this in on
each transfer.
