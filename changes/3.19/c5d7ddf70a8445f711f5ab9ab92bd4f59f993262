drm/nouveau: introduce nv_device_is_cpu_coherent()

Add a function allowing us to know whether a device is CPU-coherent,
i.e. accesses performed by the CPU on GPU-mapped buffers will
be immediately visible on the GPU side and vice-versa.

For now, a device is considered to be coherent if it uses the PCI bus on
a non-ARM architecture.
