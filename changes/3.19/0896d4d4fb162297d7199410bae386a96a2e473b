tty: serial: msm: Support sysrq on uartDM devices

To properly support sysrq on uartDM hardware we need to properly
handle break characters. With the DM hardware the fifo can pack 4
characters at a time, where a break is indicated by an all zero
byte. Unfortunately, we can't differentiate between an all zero
byte for a break and an all zero byte of data, so try and do as
best we can. First unmask the RX break start interrupt and record
the interrupt when it arrives. Then while processing the fifo,
detect the break by searching for an all zero character as long
as we recently received an RX break start interrupt. This should
make sysrq work fairly well.
