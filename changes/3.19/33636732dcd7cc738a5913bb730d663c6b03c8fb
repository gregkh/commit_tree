perf/x86/intel: Fix bug for "cycles:p" and "cycles:pp" on SLM

cycles:p and cycles:pp do not work on SLM since commit:

   86a04461a99f ("perf/x86: Revamp PEBS event selection")

UOPS_RETIRED.ALL is not a PEBS capable event, so it should not be used
to count cycle number.

Actually SLM calls intel_pebs_aliases_core2() which uses INST_RETIRED.ANY_P
to count the number of cycles. It's a PEBS capable event. But inv and
cmask must be set to count cycles.

Considering SLM allows all events as PEBS with no flags, only
INST_RETIRED.ANY_P, inv=1, cmask=16 needs to handled specially.
