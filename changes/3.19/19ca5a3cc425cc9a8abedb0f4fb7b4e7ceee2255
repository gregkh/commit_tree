EDAC, pci_sysfs: remove unneccessary ifdef around entire file

The file edac_pci_sysfs.c is dependent on CONFIG_PCI. This is already
modelled in the Makefile, but edac_pci_sysfs.o is still contained in
the list of files compiled even without CONFIG_PCI.

This change removes edac_pci_sysfs.o from the list of built objects
when not having CONFIG_PCI enabled and removes the then-unnecessary
ifdef from the source file.
