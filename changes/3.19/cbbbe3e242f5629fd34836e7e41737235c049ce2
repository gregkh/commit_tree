Bluetooth: Add support for sending LE SC Confirm value

Once the public key exchange is complete the next step is for the
non-initiating device to send a SMP Pairing Confirm PDU to the
initiating device. This requires the use of a new smp_f4 confirm value
generation function which in turn builds on the AES-CMAC cryptographic
function.
