staging: comedi: adl_pci9118: use comedi_async 'scans_done' to detect EOA

The comedi core now counts the number of samples added to the async buffer and
detects the end-of-scan and increments the comedi_async 'scans_done' counter.

Remove the private data member 'ai_act_scan' and use the 'scans_done' member
to detect the end-of-acquisition.
