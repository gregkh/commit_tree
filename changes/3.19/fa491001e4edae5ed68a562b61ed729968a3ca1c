ieee802154: add valid psdu length helper

This patch adds a generic valid psdu length check function helper. This
is useful to check the length field after receiving. For example the
at86rf231 doesn't filter invalid psdu length. Sometimes the CRC can also
be correct. If we get the lqi value with an invalid frame length the
kernel may crash because we dereference an invalid pointer in the
receive buffer.
