wusb: replace memset by memzero_explicit

Memset on a local variable may be removed when it is called just before the
variable goes out of scope.  Using memzero_explicit defeats this
optimization.  A simplified version of the semantic patch that makes this
change is as follows: (http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
identifier x;
type T;
@@

{
... when any
T x[...];
... when any
    when exists
- memset
+ memzero_explicit
  (x,
-0,
  ...)
... when != x
    when strict
}
// </smpl>
