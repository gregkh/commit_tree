reset: sunxi: fix spinlock initialization

Call spin_lock_init() before the spinlocks are used, both in early init
and probe functions preventing a lockdep splat.

I have been observing lockdep complaining [1] during boot on my a80 optimus [2]
when CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING has been enabled. This patch resolves the splat,
and has been tested on a few other sunxi platforms without issue.
