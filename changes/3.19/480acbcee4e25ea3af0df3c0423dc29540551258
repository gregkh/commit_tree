iwlwifi: mvm: flush queues without mutex held

For WMM-AC we may have to be changing QoS parameters while the
queues are being flushed. This is not relevant in the "drop"
case, but matters when we wait for the device to finish the
transmissions.

To allow this, do the actual waiting without holding the mutex.
