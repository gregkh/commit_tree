[media] media: davinci: vpbe: missing clk_put

we are getting struct clk using clk_get before calling
clk_prepare_enable. but if clk_prepare_enable fails, then we are
jumping to fail_mutex_unlock where we are just unlocking the mutex,
but we are not freeing the clock source.
this patch just adds a call to clk_put before jumping to
fail_mutex_unlock.
