dm cache: share cache-metadata object across inactive and active DM tables

If a DM table is reloaded with an inactive table when the device is not
suspended (normal procedure for LVM2), then there will be two dm-bufio
objects that can diverge.  This can lead to a situation where the
inactive table uses bufio to read metadata at the same time the active
table writes metadata -- resulting in the inactive table having stale
metadata buffers once it is promoted to the active table slot.

Fix this by using reference counting and a global list of cache metadata
objects to ensure there is only one metadata object per metadata device.
