Revert "swiotlb-xen: pass dev_addr to swiotlb_tbl_unmap_single"

This reverts commit 2c3fc8d26dd09b9d7069687eead849ee81c78e46.

This commit broke on x86 PV because entries in the generic SWIOTLB are
indexed using (pseudo-)physical address not DMA address and these are
not the same in a x86 PV guest.
