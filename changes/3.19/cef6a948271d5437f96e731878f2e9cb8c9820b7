NVMe: Command abort handling fixes

Aborts all requeued commands prior to killing the request_queue. For
commands that time out on a dying request queue, set the "Do Not Retry"
bit on the command status so the command cannot be requeued. Finanally, if
the driver is requested to abort a command it did not start, do nothing.
