macvlan: delay the header check for dodgy packets into lower device

We do header check twice for a dodgy packet. One is done before
macvlan_start_xmit(), another is done before lower device's
ndo_start_xmit(). The first one seems redundant so this patch tries to
delay header check until a packet reaches its lower device (or macvtap)
through always enabling NETIF_F_GSO_ROBUST for macvlan device.
