tty: Remove sparse lock annotations from tty_write_lock()/_unlock()

sparse lock annotations cannot represent conditional acquire, such
as mutex_lock_interruptible() or mutex_trylock(), and produce sparse
warnings at _every_ correct call site.

Remove lock annotations from tty_write_lock() and tty_write_unlock().

Fixes sparse warnings:
