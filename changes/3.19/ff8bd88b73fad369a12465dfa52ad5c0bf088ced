drbd: fix resync throttling initialization

If for some reason DRBD resync was the only activity on a backend
device, drbd_rs_c_min_rate_throttle() would mistakenly decide that it is
still initialization time, and keep throttling the resync.

This patch explicitly initializes ->rs_last_events to the current
backend event counters, and drops the rs_last_events == 0 from the
throttle condition.
