mac80211: increase U-APSD max service period length

Deliver up to 128 frames during service period instead of 8 if
unlimited is specified by the client during association.
8 was just an arbitrary value; so is 128 since unlimited can
be any number.

However for large traffic bursts, increasing this value looks
reasonable. Also, it seems that a few certification tests
expect more frames to be delivered during SP.
