mm: memcontrol: convert reclaim iterator to simple css refcounting

The memcg reclaim iterators use a complicated weak reference scheme to
prevent pinning cgroups indefinitely in the absence of memory pressure.

However, during the ongoing cgroup core rework, css lifetime has been
decoupled such that a pinned css no longer interferes with removal of
the user-visible cgroup, and all this complexity is now unnecessary.
