mm: memcontrol: remove unnecessary PCG_MEM memory charge flag

PCG_MEM is a remnant from an earlier version of 0a31bc97c80c ("mm:
memcontrol: rewrite uncharge API"), used to tell whether migration cleared
a charge while leaving pc->mem_cgroup valid and PCG_USED set.  But in the
final version, mem_cgroup_migrate() directly uncharges the source page,
rendering this distinction unnecessary.  Remove it.
