crypto: nx - Fix SHA concurrence issue and sg limit bounds

NX SHA algorithms stores the message digest into tfm what
cause a concurrence issue where hashes may be replaced by others.
This patch cleans up the cases where it's handling unnecessarily shared
variables in nx context and copies the current msg digest to a sctx->state
in order to safetly handle with the hashe's state.

Also fixes and does some clean ups regarding the right sg max limit
and bounds to the sg list avoind a memory crash.
