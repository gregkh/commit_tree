ipv4: tcp: get rid of ugly unicast_sock

In commit be9f4a44e7d41 ("ipv4: tcp: remove per net tcp_sock")
I tried to address contention on a socket lock, but the solution
I chose was horrible :

commit 3a7c384ffd57e ("ipv4: tcp: unicast_sock should not land outside
of TCP stack") addressed a selinux regression.

commit 0980e56e506b ("ipv4: tcp: set unicast_sock uc_ttl to -1")
took care of another regression.

commit b5ec8eeac46 ("ipv4: fix ip_send_skb()") fixed another regression.

commit 811230cd85 ("tcp: ipv4: initialize unicast_sock sk_pacing_rate")
was another shot in the dark.

Really, just use a proper socket per cpu, and remove the skb_orphan()
call, to re-enable flow control.

This solves a serious problem with FQ packet scheduler when used in
hostile environments, as we do not want to allocate a flow structure
for every RST packet sent in response to a spoofed packet.
