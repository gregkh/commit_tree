tipc: fix missing spinlock init and nullptr oops

commit 908344cdda80 ("tipc: fix bug in multicast congestion
handling") introduced two bugs with the bclink wakeup
function. This commit fixes the missing spinlock init for the
waiting_sks list. We also eliminate the race condition
between the waiting_sks length check/dequeue operations in
tipc_bclink_wakeup_users by simply removing the redundant
length check.
