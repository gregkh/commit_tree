ARM: kexec: Make .text R/W in machine_kexec

With the introduction of Kees Cook's patch to make the kernel .text
read-only the existing method by which kexec works got broken since it
directly pokes some values in the template code, which resides in the
.text section.

The current patch changes the way those values are inserted so that poking
.text section occurs only in machine_kexec (e.g when we are about to nuke
the old kernel and are beyond the point of return). This allows to use
set_kernel_text_rw() to directly patch the values in the .text section.

I had already sent a patch which achieved this but it was significantly
more complicated, so this is a cleaner/straight-forward approach.
