batman-adv: Unify fragment size calculation

The fragmentation code was replaced in 610bfc6bc99bc83680d190ebc69359a05fc7f605
("batman-adv: Receive fragmented packets and merge") by an implementation which
can handle up to 16 fragments of a packet. The packet is prepared for the split
in fragments by the function batadv_frag_send_packet and the actual split is
done by batadv_frag_create.

Both functions calculate the size of a fragment themself. But their calculation
differs because batadv_frag_send_packet also subtracts ETH_HLEN. Therefore,
the check in batadv_frag_send_packet "can a full fragment can be created?" may
return true even when batadv_frag_create cannot create a full fragment.

The function batadv_frag_create doesn't check the size of the skb before
splitting it and therefore might try to create a larger fragment than the
remaining buffer. This creates an integer underflow and an invalid len is given
to skb_split.
