net: fec: use swab32s() instead of cpu_to_be32()

when swap_buffer() is being called, we know for sure, that we need to
byte swap the data. Furthermore, this function is called for swapping
data in both directions. Thus cpu_to_be32() is semantically not
correct for all use cases. Use swab32s() to reflect this.
