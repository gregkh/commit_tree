staging: lustre: osc: remove final uses of the GOTO macro

The semantic patch that makes this change is as follows:
(http://coccinelle.lip6.fr/)

// <smpl>
@@
identifier lbl;
identifier rc;
constant c;
@@

- GOTO(lbl,\(rc\|c\));
+ goto lbl;

@@
identifier lbl;
expression rc;
@@

- GOTO(lbl,rc);
+ rc;
+ goto lbl;
// </smpl>

In one case (OES_INV), consecutive gotos were factorized and a break was
removed.
