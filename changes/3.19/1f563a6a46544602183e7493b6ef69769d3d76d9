drm/vmwgfx: Don't use memory accounting for kernel-side fence objects

Kernel side fence objects are used when unbinding resources and may thus be
created as part of a memory reclaim operation. This might trigger recursive
memory reclaims and result in the kernel running out of stack space.

So a simple way out is to avoid accounting of these fence objects.
In principle this is OK since while user-space can trigger the creation of
such objects, it can't really hold on to them. However, their lifetime is
quite long, so some form of accounting should perhaps be implemented in the
future.

Fixes kernel crashes when running, for example viewperf11 ensight-04 test 3
with low system memory settings.
