Bluetooth: HCI H5 peer reset detection

H5 Specification says:
If a SYNC message is received while in the Active State, it is
assumed that the peer device has reset. The local device should
therefore perform a full reset of the upper stack, and start Link
Establishment again at the Uninitialized State. Upon entering the
Active State, the first packet sent shall have its SEQ and ACK
numbers set to zero.

This patch resets the HCI H5 driver data/state to unitialized and
reports an HCI hardware error event to notify the upper stack that
HCI synchronization has been lost. H5 will be re-synchronized and
upper stack should generate an HCI Reset command.
