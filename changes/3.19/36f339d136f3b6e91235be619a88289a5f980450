serial: pl011: Fix build breakage with !CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE

Commit 479e9b94fdce7bc4 ("serial: Refactor uart_flush_buffer() from
uart_close") refactored the uart_flush_buffer() in uart_close() into
those drivers that define a flush_buffer() method. However, in the
amba-pl011 driver configured without CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE, flush_buffer()
is a NULL method, so the direct call fails to compile.

Check and call the flush_buffer() method through the ops table instead.
