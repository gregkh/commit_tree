usb: gadget: udc: atmel: fix possible IN hang issue

When receive data, the RXRDY in status register set by hardware
after a new packet has been stored in the endpoint FIFO. When it
is copied from FIFO, this bit is cleared which make the FIFO can
be accessed again.

In the receive_data() function, this bit RXRDY has been cleared.
So, after the receive_data() function return, this bit should
not be cleared again, or else it may cause the accessing FIFO
corrupt, which will make the data loss.
