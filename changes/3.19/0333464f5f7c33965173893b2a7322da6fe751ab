ixgbevf: fix possible crashes in probe and remove

This patch resolves couple of issues in ixgbevf_probe/remove():

1. Fix a case where adapter->state is tested after free_netdev() this is
same as the patch for ixgbe from Daniel Borkmann <dborkman@redhat.com>:
commit b5b2ffc0574e1f27 ("ixgbe: fix use after free adapter->state test in ixgbe_remove/ixgbe_probe")

2. Move pci_set_drvdata() after all the error checks in ixgbevf_probe() and
then add a check in ixgbevf_probe() to avoid running the cleanup functions
twice in cases where probe failed.
