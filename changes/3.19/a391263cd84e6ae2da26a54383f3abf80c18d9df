ARM: 8203/1: mm: try to re-use old ASID assignments following a rollover

Rather than unconditionally allocating a fresh ASID to an mm from an
older generation, attempt to re-use the old assignment where possible.

This can bring performance benefits on systems where the ASID is used to
tag things other than the TLB (e.g. branch prediction resources).
