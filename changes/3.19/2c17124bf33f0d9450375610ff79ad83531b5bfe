s390/dasd: fix infinite term I/O loop

During device activation all paths could be lost and since the device
is not active it has no indication of this fact - hence the CQR will
time-out. The following cancelation might fail with -EINVAL because
CIO took over control and started path verification. In this case mark
the CQR as being CLEARED since it could not be running any more.
