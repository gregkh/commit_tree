virtio: add low-level APIs for feature bits

Add low level APIs to test/set/clear feature bits.
For use by transports, to make it easier to
write code independent of feature bit array format.

Note: APIs is prefixed with __ and has _bit suffix
to stress its low level nature.  It's for use by transports only:
drivers should use virtio_has_feature and never need to set/clear
features.
