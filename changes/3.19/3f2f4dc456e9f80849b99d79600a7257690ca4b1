PCI: Pass bridge device, not bus, when updating bridge windows

pci_setup_bridge_io(), pci_setup_bridge_mmio(), and
pci_setup_bridge_mmio_pref() program the windows of PCI-PCI bridges.
Previously they accepted a pointer to the pci_bus of the secondary bus,
then looked up the bridge leading to that bus.  Pass the bridge directly,
which will make it more convenient for future callers.

No functional change.
