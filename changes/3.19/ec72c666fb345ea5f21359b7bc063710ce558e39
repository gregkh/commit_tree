usr/Kconfig: make initrd compression algorithm selection not expert

The kernel has support for (nearly) every compression algorithm known to
man, each to handle some particular microscopic niche.

Unfortunately all of these always get compiled in if you want to support
INITRDs, and can be only disabled when CONFIG_EXPERT is set.

I don't see why I need to set EXPERT just to properly configure the initrd
compression algorithms, and not always include every possible algorithm

Usually the initrd is just compressed with gzip anyways, at least that's
true on all distributions I use.

Remove the dependencies for initrd compression on CONFIG_EXPERT.

Make the various options just default y, which should be good enough to
not break any previous configuration.
