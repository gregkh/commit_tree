Btrfs: make find_first_extent_bit be able to cache any state

Right now the only caller of find_first_extent_bit() that is interested
in caching extent states (transaction or log commit), never gets an extent
state cached. This is because find_first_extent_bit() only caches states
that have at least one of the flags EXTENT_IOBITS or EXTENT_BOUNDARY, and
the transaction/log commit caller always passes a tree that doesn't have
ever extent states with any of those flags (they can only have one of the
following flags: EXTENT_DIRTY, EXTENT_NEW or EXTENT_NEED_WAIT).

This change together with the following one in the patch series (titled
"Btrfs: avoid returning -ENOMEM in convert_extent_bit() too early") will
help reduce significantly the chances of calls to convert_extent_bit()
fail with -ENOMEM when called from the transaction/log commit code.
