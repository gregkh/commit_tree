PM / OPP: take RCU lock in dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count

A lot of callers are missing the fact that dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count
needs to be called under RCU lock. Given that RCU locks can safely be
nested, instead of providing *_locked() API, let's take RCU lock inside
dev_pm_opp_get_opp_count() and leave callers as is.
