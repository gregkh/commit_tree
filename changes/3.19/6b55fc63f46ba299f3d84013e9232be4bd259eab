audit, sched/wait: Fixup kauditd_thread() wait loop

The kauditd_thread wait loop is a bit iffy; it has a number of problems:

 - calls try_to_freeze() before schedule(); you typically want the
   thread to re-evaluate the sleep condition when unfreezing, also
   freeze_task() issues a wakeup.

 - it unconditionally does the {add,remove}_wait_queue(), even when the
   sleep condition is false.

Use wait_event_freezable() that does the right thing.
