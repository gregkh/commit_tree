perf evlist: Do not poll events that use the system_wide flag

The system_wide flag causes a selected event to be opened always without
a pid.

Consequently it will never get a POLLHUP, but it is used for tracking in
combination with other events, so it should not need to be polled
anyway.

Therefore don't add it for polling.
