ARM: OMAP4: PM: Only do static dependency configuration in omap4_init_static_deps

Commit 705814b5ea6f ("ARM: OMAP4+: PM: Consolidate OMAP4 PM code to
re-use it for OMAP5")

Moved logic generic for OMAP5+ as part of the init routine by
introducing omap4_pm_init. However, the patch left the powerdomain
initial setup, an unused omap4430 es1.0 check and a spurious log
"Power Management for TI OMAP4." in the original code.

Remove the duplicate code which is already present in omap4_pm_init from
omap4_init_static_deps.

As part of this change, also move the u-boot version print out of the
static dependency function to the omap4_pm_init function.
