usb: renesas_usbhs: gadget: fix the behavior of pullup

This patch fixes an issue that this driver always enable the D+ pullup
after it detected the VBUS connection even though this usb controller
can control the D+ pullup timing by software. So, this driver should
enable the D+ pullup after a gadget driver called usb_gadget_connect().
