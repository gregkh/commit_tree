tracing: Add NOT to filtering logic

Ted noticed that he could not filter on an event for a bit being cleared.
That's because the filtering logic only tests event fields with a limited
number of comparisons which, for bit logic, only include "&", which can
test if a bit is set, but there's no good way to see if a bit is clear.

This adds a way to do: !(field & 2048)

Which returns true if the bit is not set, and false otherwise.

Note, currently !(field1 == 10 && field2 == 15) is not supported.
That is, the 'not' only works for direct comparisons, not for the
AND and OR logic.
