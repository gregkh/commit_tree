zsmalloc: correct fragile [kmap|kunmap]_atomic use

The kunmap_atomic should use virtual address getting by kmap_atomic.
However, some pieces of code in zsmalloc uses modified address, not the
one got by kmap_atomic for kunmap_atomic.

It's okay for working because zsmalloc modifies the address inner
PAGE_SIZE bounday so it works with current kmap_atomic's implementation.
But it's still fragile with potential changing of kmap_atomic so let's
correct it.

I got a subtle bug when I implemented a new feature of zsmalloc
(compaction) due to a link's mishandling (the link was over page
boundary).  Although it was totally my mistake, it took a while to find
the cause because an unpredictable kmapped address was unmapped causing an
almost random crash.
