IIO: add si7020 driver

This patch adds support to the Industrial IO subsystem
for the Silicon Labs Si7013/20/21 Relative Humidity and
Temperature Sensors.

Website: http://www.silabs.com/products/sensors/humidity-sensors/Pages/si7013-20-21.aspx

These are i2c devices which measure relative humidity
and temperature and all use the same protocol. The
Si7013 has an additional input with programmable
linearization which is not supported because that's
complicated and I didn't need it.
