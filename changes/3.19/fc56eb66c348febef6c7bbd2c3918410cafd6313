KVM: s390: fix handling of lctl[g]/stctl[g]

According to the architecture all instructions are suppressing if memory
access is prohibited due to DAT protection, unless stated otherwise for
an instruction.
The lctl[g]/stctl[g] implementations handled this incorrectly since
control register handling was done piecemeal, which means they had
terminating instead of suppressing semantics.
This patch fixes this.
