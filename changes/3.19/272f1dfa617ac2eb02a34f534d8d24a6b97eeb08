rtc: at91sam9: use standard readl/writel functions instead of raw versions

Raw versions of writel and writel should not be directly used and should
be replaced by their relaxed versions (readl/writel_relaxed), which take
endianness conversion into account.

In this driver we prefer the standard readl/writel function which add the
appropriate memory barrier around the access (the performance penalty is
negligible for this kind of application).
