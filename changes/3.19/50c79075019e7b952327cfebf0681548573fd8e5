mac802154: set panid address filter on ifup

This patch moves the setting of hardware panid address filtering
inside of interface up instead doing it it directly inside of netlink
interface. The netlink call which can only be called when netif isn't
running sets only the necessary panid value in sdata. After an
interface up the address filter will be set with this value.
