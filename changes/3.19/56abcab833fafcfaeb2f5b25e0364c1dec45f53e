OHCI: add a quirk for ULi M5237 blocking on reset

Commit 8dccddbc2368 ("OHCI: final fix for NVIDIA problems (I hope)")
introduced into 3.1.9 broke boot on e.g. Freescale P2020DS development
board. The code path that was previously specific to NVIDIA controllers
had then become taken for all chips.

However, the M5237 installed on the board wedges solid when accessing
its base+OHCI_FMINTERVAL register, making it impossible to boot any
kernel newer than 3.1.8 on this particular and apparently other similar
machines.

Don't readl() and writel() base+OHCI_FMINTERVAL on PCI ID 10b9:5237.

The patch is suitable for the -next tree as well as all maintained
kernels up to 3.2 inclusive.
