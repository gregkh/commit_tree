net: dsa: Don't set skb->protocol on outgoing tagged packets

Setting skb->protocol to a private protocol type may result in warning
messages such as
	e1000e 0000:00:19.0 em1: checksum_partial proto=dada!

This happens if the L3 protocol is IP or IPv6 and skb->ip_summed is set
to CHECKSUM_PARTIAL. Looking through the code, it appears that changing
skb->protocol for transmitted packets is not necessary and may actually
be harmful. For example, it prevents purposely unmodified (from a DSA
perspective) network drivers from properly setting up their transmit
checksum offload pointers since they inspect skb->protocol to set up the
IPv4 header or IPv6 header pointers. So don't unnecessarily change the
protocol field.
