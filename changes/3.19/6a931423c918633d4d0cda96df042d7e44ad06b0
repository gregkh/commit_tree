defxx: Disable DEFEA's ESIC I/O decoding on shutdown

Make sure the option card does not respond after shutdown by disabling
it via ESIC's Expansion Board Control register.  Also disable memory and
port I/O decoders, the latter in particular to disable slot-specific I/O
decoding that otherwise remains active even in the board is disabled.
