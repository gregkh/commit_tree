arm: perf: kill get_hw_events()

Now that the arm pmu code is limited to CPU PMUs the get_hw_events()
function is superfluous, as we'll always have a set of per-cpu
pmu_hw_events structures.

This patch removes the get_hw_events() function, replacing it with
a percpu hw_events pointer. Uses of get_hw_events are updated to use
this_cpu_ptr.
