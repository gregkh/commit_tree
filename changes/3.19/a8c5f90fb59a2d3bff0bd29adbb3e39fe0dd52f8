ip_tunnel: Ops registration for secondary encap (fou, gue)

Instead of calling fou and gue functions directly from ip_tunnel
use ops for these that were previously registered. This patch adds the
logic to add and remove encapsulation operations for ip_tunnel,
and modified fou (and gue) to register with ip_tunnels.

This patch also addresses a circular dependency between ip_tunnel
and fou that was causing link errors when CONFIG_NET_IP_TUNNEL=y
and CONFIG_NET_FOU=m. References to fou an gue have been removed from
ip_tunnel.c
