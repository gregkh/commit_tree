extcon: max77693: Fix cable name of JIG_UART_ON

When JIG was set to "boot on" mode, the UART connection did not work
because it was assigned to Dock-Car cable (path: audio), not JIG-UART-ON
cable.

This was introduced in 39bf369e4ed3 ("extcon: max77693: Add support dock
device and buttons") while adding dock features.

Assign the JIG-UART-ON back to UART path.
