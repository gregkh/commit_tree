arm64/efi: set PE/COFF section alignment to 4 KB

Position independent AArch64 code needs to be linked and loaded at the
same relative offset from a 4 KB boundary, or adrp/add and adrp/ldr
pairs will not work correctly. (This is how PC relative symbol
references with a 4 GB reach are emitted)

We need to declare this in the PE/COFF header, otherwise the PE/COFF
loader may load the Image and invoke the stub at an offset which
violates this rule.
