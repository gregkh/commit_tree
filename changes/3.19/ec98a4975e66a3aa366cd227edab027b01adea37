leds: leds-gpio: Fix legacy GPIO number case

In the legacy case, led_dat->gpiod is initialized correctly, but
overwritten later by template->gpiod, which is NULL, causing leds-gpio
to fail with:

    gpiod_direction_output: invalid GPIO
    leds-gpio: probe of leds-gpio failed with error -22

Move the initialization of led_dat->gpiod from template->gpiod up, and
always use led_dat->gpiod later, to fix this.
