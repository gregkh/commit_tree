NVMe: Fix FS mount issue (hot-remove followed by hot-add)

After Hot-remove of a device with a mounted partition,
when the device is hot-added again, the new node reappears
as nvme0n1. Mounting this new node fails with the error:

mount: mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 on /mnt failed: File exists.

The old nodes's FS entries still exist and the kernel can't re-create
procfs and sysfs entries for the new node with the same name.
The patch fixes this issue.
