Revert "IPoIB: Use dedicated workqueues per interface"

This reverts commit 5141861cd5e17eac9676ff49c5abfafbea2b0e98.

The series of IPoIB bug fixes that went into 3.19-rc1 introduce
regressions, and after trying to sort things out, we decided to revert
to 3.18's IPoIB driver and get things right for 3.20.
