mm: Don't count the stack guard page towards RLIMIT_STACK

Commit fee7e49d4514 ("mm: propagate error from stack expansion even for
guard page") made sure that we return the error properly for stack
growth conditions.  It also theorized that counting the guard page
towards the stack limit might break something, but also said "Let's see
if anybody notices".

Somebody did notice.  Apparently android-x86 sets the stack limit very
close to the limit indeed, and including the guard page in the rlimit
check causes the android 'zygote' process problems.

So this adds the (fairly trivial) code to make the stack rlimit check be
against the actual real stack size, rather than the size of the vma that
includes the guard page.
