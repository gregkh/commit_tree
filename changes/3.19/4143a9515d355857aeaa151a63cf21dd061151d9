Revert "IPoIB: Consolidate rtnl_lock tasks in workqueue"

This reverts commit afe1de664ef3cb756e70938d99417dcbc6b1379a.

The series of IPoIB bug fixes that went into 3.19-rc1 introduce
regressions, and after trying to sort things out, we decided to revert
to 3.18's IPoIB driver and get things right for 3.20.
