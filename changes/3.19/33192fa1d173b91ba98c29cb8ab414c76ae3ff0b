staging: unisys: refactor VISORCHIPSET_BUS_INFO

Remove the typedef and use the name struct visorchipset_bus_info instead.
Fix CamelCase member names in the structure:

busNo => bus_no
chanInfo => chan_info
partitionGuid => partition_uuid
partitionHandle => partition_handle
Reserved1 => reserved1
Reserved2 => reserved2
procObject => proc_object

Update references to changed names.
