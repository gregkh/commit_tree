blk-mq: fix hang in bt_get()

Avoid that if there are fewer hardware queues than CPU threads that
bt_get() can hang. The symptoms of the hang were as follows:

* All tags allocated for a particular hardware queue.
* (nr_tags) pending commands for that hardware queue.
* No pending commands for the software queues associated with that
  hardware queue.
