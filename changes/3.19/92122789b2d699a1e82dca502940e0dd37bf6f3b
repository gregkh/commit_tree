drm/i915: preserve SSC if previously set v3

Some machines may have a broken VBT or no VBT at all, but we still want
to use SSC there.  So check for it and keep it enabled if we see it
already on.  Based on an earlier fix from Kristian.

v2: honor modparam if set too (Daniel)
    read out at init time and store for panel_use_ssc() use (Jesse)
v3: trust BIOS configuration over VBT like we do for DP (Jani)
