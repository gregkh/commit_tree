mac80211: synchronously reserve TID per station

In TDLS (e.g., TDLS off-channel) there is a requirement for
some drivers to supply an unused TID between the AP and the
device to the FW, to allow sending PTI requests and to allow
the FW to aggregate on a specific TID for better throughput.

To ensure that the allocated TID is indeed unused, this patch
introduces an API for blocking the driver from TXing on that
TID.
