nfsd: fix inclusive vfs_fsync_range() end

The vfs_fsync_range() call during write processing got the end of the
range off by one.  The range is inclusive, not exclusive.  The error has
nfsd sync more data than requested -- it's correct but unnecessary
overhead.

The call during commit processing is correct so I copied that pattern in
write processing.  Maybe a helper would be nice but I kept it trivial.

This is untested.  I found it while reviewing code for something else
entirely.
