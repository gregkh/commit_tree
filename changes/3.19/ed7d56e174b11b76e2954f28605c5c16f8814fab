s390/kprobes: fix instruction copy for out of line execution

When we generate the instruction for out of line execution the length
of the to be copied instruction was evaluated from a not initialized
memory location.
Therefore we ended up with a random (2, 4 or 6) number of bytes being
copied instead of taking the real instruction length into account.
This works surprisingly well most of the time, but still not always.
