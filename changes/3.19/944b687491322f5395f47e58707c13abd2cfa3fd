mm: export "high_memory" symbol on !MMU

The symbol 'high_memory' is provided on both MMU- and NOMMU-kernels, but
only one of them is exported, which leads to module build errors in
drivers that work fine built-in:

  ERROR: "high_memory" [drivers/net/virtio_net.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "high_memory" [drivers/net/ppp/ppp_mppe.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "high_memory" [drivers/mtd/nand/nand.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "high_memory" [crypto/tcrypt.ko] undefined!
  ERROR: "high_memory" [crypto/cts.ko] undefined!

This exports the symbol to get these to work on NOMMU as well.
