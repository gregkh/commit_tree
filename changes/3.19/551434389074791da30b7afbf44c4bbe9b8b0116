ARM: OMAP1/2+: MMC: separate platform data for mmc and mmc hs driver

- omap mmc driver supports multiplexing, omap_mmc_hs doesn't
this leads to one of the major confusions in the omap_hsmmc driver

- platform data should be read-only for the driver
most callbacks are not set by the omap3 platform init code while still
required. So they are set from the driver probe function, which is against
the paradigm that platform-data should not be modified by the driver
typical examples are card_detect, read_only callbacks

un-bundling by searching for driver name \"omap_hsmmc in the
arch/arm folder. omap_hsmmc_platform_data is not initialized directly,
but from omap2_hsmmc_info, which is defined in a separate header file
not touched by this patch

hwmod includes platform headers to declare features of the platform. All
the declared features are prefixed OMAP_HSMMC. There is no need to
include platform header from hwmod other except for feature defines
