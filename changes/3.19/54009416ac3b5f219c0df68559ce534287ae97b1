sched/numa: Find the preferred nid with complex NUMA topology

On systems with complex NUMA topologies, the node scoring is adjusted
to allow workloads to converge on nodes that are near each other.

The way a task group's preferred nid is determined needs to be adjusted,
in order for the preferred_nid to be consistent with group_weight scoring.
This ensures that we actually try to converge workloads on adjacent nodes.
