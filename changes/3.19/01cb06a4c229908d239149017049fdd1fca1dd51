tracing: Add seq_buf_get_buf() and seq_buf_commit() helper functions

Add two helper functions; seq_buf_get_buf() and seq_buf_commit() that
are used by seq_buf_path(). This makes the code similar to the
seq_file: seq_path() function, and will help to be able to consolidate
the functions between seq_file and trace_seq.
