Fnic: Improper resue of exchange Ids

IOs belonging to an rport are aborted with Internal terminate option
when rport goes offline. Any new IO issued to the rport during this
time can reuse the terminated exchange which will cause inconsistent
state of the exchange between local port and remote port.

fc_rport_priv is set to RPORT_ST_DELETE before exchanges are aborted by
libfc. Not issuing amy more I/O requests when RPORT_ST_DELETE is set,
will avoid inconsistent state of the exchange between local port and
remote port.

- Increment fnic version from 1.6.0.13 to 1.6.0.14
