kernfs: Fix kernfs_name_compare

Returning a difference from a comparison functions is usually wrong
(see acbbe6fbb240 "kcmp: fix standard comparison bug" for the long
story). Here there is the additional twist that if the void pointers
ns and kn->ns happen to differ by a multiple of 2^32,
kernfs_name_compare returns 0, falsely reporting a match to the
caller.

Technically 'hash - kn->hash' is ok since the hashes are restricted to
31 bits, but it's better to avoid that subtlety.
