serial: Fix locking for uart driver set_termios() method

The low-level uart driver may modify termios settings to override
settings that are not compatible with the uart, such as CRTSCTS.
Thus, callers of the low-level uart driver's set_termios() method must
hold termios_rwsem write lock to prevent concurrent access to termios,
in case such override occurs.

The termios_rwsem lock requirement does not extend to console setup
(ie., uart_set_options), as console setup cannot race with tty
operations. Nor does this lock requirement extend to functions which
cannot be concurrent with tty ioctls (ie., uart_port_startup() and
uart_resume_port()).

Further, always claim the port mutex to protect hardware
re-reprogramming in the set_termios() uart driver method. Note this
is unnecessary for console initialization in uart_set_options()
which cannot be concurrent with other uart operations.
