amdkfd: Add device queue manager module

The queue scheduler divides into two sections, one section is process bounded
and the other section is device bounded.
The device bounded section is handled by this module.
The DQM module handles queue setup, update and tear-down from the device side.
It also supports suspend/resume operation.

v3: Changed device_init, added the use of the new gart allocation functions an
Added documentation.

v4:

Fixed a race in DQM queue scheduler where dqm->lock must be held when accessing
dqm->queue_count and dqm->processes_count. This fixes runlist IB allocation
failures when DQM is under load.

Fixed race in DQM queue destruction where queues being destroyed must be
removed from qpd->queues_list prior to preemption, or concurrent queue
creation activity may reschedule them while their MQD is destroyed.

Fixed EOP queue size setting in CP_HPD_EOP_CONTROL, because the size is
specified as (log2(size_dwords)-1). The previous calculation assumed the
size was specified in bytes, which caused interference between EOP queues
when multiple MEC pipelines were active.

v5:

Move amdkfd from drm/radeon/ to drm/amd/
Change format of mqd structure to match latest KV firmware
Add support for AQL queues creation to enable working with open-source HSA
runtime
Remove unused unmap_queue function
Various fixes (Style, typos)
