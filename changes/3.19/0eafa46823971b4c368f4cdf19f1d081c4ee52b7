rcu: Remove CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_VERBOSE

The CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_VERBOSE Kconfig parameter causes preemptible
RCU's CPU stall warnings to dump out any preempted tasks that are blocking
the current RCU grace period.  This information is useful, and the default
has been CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_VERBOSE=y for some years.  It is therefore
time for this commit to remove this Kconfig parameter, so that future
kernel builds will always act as if CONFIG_RCU_CPU_STALL_VERBOSE=y.
