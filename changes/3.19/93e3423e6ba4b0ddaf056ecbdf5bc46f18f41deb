ALSA: hda_controller: Separate stream_tag for input and output streams.

Implemented separate stream_tag assignment for input and output streams.
According to hda specification stream tag must be unique throughout the
input streams group, however an output stream might use a stream tag
which is already in use by an input stream. This change is necessary
to support HW which provides a total of more than 15 stream DMA engines
which with legacy implementation causes an overflow on SDxCTL.STRM
field (and the whole SDxCTL register) and as a result usage of
Reserved value 0 in the SDxCTL.STRM field which confuses HDA controller.
