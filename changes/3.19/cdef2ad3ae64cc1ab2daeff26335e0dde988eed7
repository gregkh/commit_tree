ASoC: dapm: Remove special DAI widget power check functions

dapm_adc_check_power() checks if the widget is active, if yes it only checks
whether there are any connected input paths. Otherwise it calls
dapm_generic_check_power() which will check for both connected input and
output paths. But the function that checks for connected output paths will
return true if the widget is a active sink. Which means the generic power
check function will work just fine and there is no need for a special power
check function.

The same applies for dapm_dac_check_power(), but with input and output paths
reversed.

This patch removes both dapm_adc_check_power() and dapm_dac_check_power()
and replace their usage with dapm_generic_check_power().
