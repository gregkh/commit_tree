staging: comedi: check actual data direction for COMEDI_BUFINFO ioctl

`do_bufinfo_ioctl()` handled the `COMEDI_BUFINFO` ioctl.  It is supposed
to update the read or write positions in the buffer depending on the
direction of data transfer set up by the asynchronous command.
Currently it checks the `SDF_CMD_READ` and `SDF_CMD_WRITE` subdevice
flags.  That's fine for most subdevices - the ones that only support one
direction, but is incorrect for those subdevices that allow the command
to be set up in either direction.  Since we now set the `CMDF_WRITE`
flag according to the data transfer direction of the current command
running on the subdevice, check that flag instead.
