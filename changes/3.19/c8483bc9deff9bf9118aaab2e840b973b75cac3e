tty: Invert tty_lock/ldisc_sem lock order

Dropping the tty lock to acquire the tty->ldisc_sem allows several
race conditions (such as hangup while changing the ldisc) which requires
extra states and testing. The ldisc_sem->tty_lock lock order has
not been required since tty buffer ownership was moved to tty_port.
