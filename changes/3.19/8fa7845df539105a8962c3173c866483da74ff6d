rcu: Remove "cpu" argument to rcu_cleanup_after_idle()

The "cpu" argument to rcu_cleanup_after_idle() is always the current
CPU, so drop it.  This moves the smp_processor_id() from the caller to
rcu_cleanup_after_idle(), saving argument-passing overhead.  Again,
the anticipated cross-CPU uses of these functions has been replaced
by NO_HZ_FULL.
