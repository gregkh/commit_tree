mac80211-hwsim: Add support for HWSIM_ATTR_DESTROY_RADIO_ON_CLOSE

Add support for new attribute HWSIM_ATTR_DESTROY_RADIO_ON_CLOSE
which can be set by the user space component. The attribute
will cause the kernel to destroy all those radios that were
created by a process if that process dies. The old behaviour
i.e., radios are persistent is still the default.
