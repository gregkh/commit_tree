perf symbols: Return the first entry with a given name in find_by_name method

When a dso contains multiple symbols which have same name, current
dso__find_symbol_by_name() only finds an one of them and there's no way
to get the all symbols without going through the rbtree.

So make symbols__find_by_name() return the first entry with the given
name and the next patch in this series will provide a way to iterate
from there, by the name ordered rb_tree, till a suitable symbol is
found.
