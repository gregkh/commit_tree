perf evlist: Fixup brown paper bag on "hint" for --mmap-pages cmdline arg

When failing due to asking for a number of mmap pages that is more than
the max, it was suggesting that an even bigger number of mmap pages
should be specified, doh, au contraire!

Before:

  [acme@ssdandy linux]$ trace -m 128 usleep 1
  Error:	Operation not permitted.
  Hint:	Check /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb (516 kB) setting.
  Hint:	Tried using 516 kB.
  Hint:	Try using a bigger -m/--mmap-pages value.
  [acme@ssdandy linux]$

After:

  [acme@ssdandy linux]$ trace -m 128 usleep 1
  Error:	Operation not permitted.
  Hint:	Check /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_mlock_kb (516 kB) setting.
  Hint:	Tried using 516 kB.
  Hint:	Try using a smaller -m/--mmap-pages value.
  [acme@ssdandy linux]$

And to (really) clarify what happens above, when what the user requests
is <= max and even then it fails, a changeset is being made to tell that
this is a per user limit, not per process (in the above example there
was another 'perf trace' running for this user, which was using all the
pages it could use).
