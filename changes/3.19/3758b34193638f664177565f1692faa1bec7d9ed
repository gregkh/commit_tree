drm: s/enum_blob_list/enum_list/ in drm_property

I guess for hysterical raisins this was meant to be the way to read
blob properties. But that's done with the two-stage approach which
uses separate blob kms object and the special-purpose get_blob ioctl.

Shipping userspace seems to have never relied on this, and the kernel
also never put any blob thing onto that property. And nowadays it
would blow up, e.g. in drm_property_destroy. Also it makes no sense to
return values in an ioctl that only returns metadata about everything.

So let's ditch all the internal code for the blob list, rename the
list to be unambiguous and sprinkle comments all over the place to
explain this peculiar piece of api.

v2: Squash in fixup from Rob to remove now unused variables.
