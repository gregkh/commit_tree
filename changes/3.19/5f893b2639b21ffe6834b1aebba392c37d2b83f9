tracing: Move enabling tracepoints to just after rcu_init()

Enabling tracepoints at boot up can be very useful. The tracepoint
can be initialized right after RCU has been. There's no need to
wait for the early_initcall() to be called. That's too late for some
things that can use tracepoints for debugging. Move the logic to
enable tracepoints out of the initcalls and into init/main.c to
right after rcu_init().

This also allows trace_printk() to be used early too.
