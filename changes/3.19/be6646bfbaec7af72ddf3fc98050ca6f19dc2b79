PCI: Prevent xHCI driver from claiming AMD Nolan USB3 DRD device

The AMD Nolan (NL) SoC contains a DesignWare USB3 Dual-Role Device that can
be operated either as a USB Host or a USB Device.  In the AMD NL platform,
this device ([1022:7912]) has a class code of PCI_CLASS_SERIAL_USB_XHCI
(0x0c0330), which means the xhci driver will claim it.

But the dwc3 driver is a more specific driver for this device, and we'd
prefer to use it instead of xhci.  To prevent xhci from claiming the
device, change the class code to 0x0c03fe, which the PCI r3.0 spec defines
as "USB device (not host controller)".  The dwc3 driver can then claim it
based on its Vendor and Device ID.
