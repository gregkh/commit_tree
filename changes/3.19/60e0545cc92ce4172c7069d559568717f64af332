NVMe: Updates for 1.1 spec

Updating commands and structures for NVMe 1.1 updates, mostly for nvme
reservations. There are no additional in-kernel uses, but this is for
the uapi.

While doing this, I noticed that the software progress features was
using the wrong value, so updating that value as well.
