alx: fix alx_poll()

Commit d75b1ade567f ("net: less interrupt masking in NAPI") uncovered
wrong alx_poll() behavior.

A NAPI poll() handler is supposed to return exactly the budget when/if
napi_complete() has not been called.

It is also supposed to return number of frames that were received, so
that netdev_budget can have a meaning.

Also, in case of TX pressure, we still have to dequeue received
packets : alx_clean_rx_irq() has to be called even if
alx_clean_tx_irq(alx) returns false, otherwise device is half duplex.
