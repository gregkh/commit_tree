net/mlx4_en: Report actual number of rings in indirection table

Hardware requires the number of rings in indirection table to be a power
of 2. When setting number of channels to a non power of 2 number,
indirection table is using only the closest power of 2 rings.
Report this number in 'ethtool -x' and not the total number of rx rings.
