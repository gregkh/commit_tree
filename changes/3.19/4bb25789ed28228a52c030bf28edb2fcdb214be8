arm: dma-mapping: plumb our iommu mapping ops into arch_setup_dma_ops

This patch plumbs the existing ARM IOMMU DMA infrastructure (which isn't
actually called outside of a few drivers) into arch_setup_dma_ops, so
that we can use IOMMUs for DMA transfers in a more generic fashion.

Since this significantly complicates the arch_setup_dma_ops function,
it is moved out of line into dma-mapping.c. If CONFIG_ARM_DMA_USE_IOMMU
is not set, the iommu parameter is ignored and the normal ops are used
instead.
