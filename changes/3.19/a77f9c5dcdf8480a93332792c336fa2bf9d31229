Revert "fast_hash: avoid indirect function calls"

This reverts commit e5a2c899957659cd1a9f789bc462f9c0b35f5150.

	Commit e5a2c899 introduced an alternative_call, arch_fast_hash2,
that selects between __jhash2 and __intel_crc4_2_hash based on the
X86_FEATURE_XMM4_2.

	Unfortunately, the alternative_call system does not appear to be
suitable for use with C functions, as register usage is not handled
properly for the called functions.  The __jhash2 function in particular
clobbers registers that are not preserved when called via
alternative_call, resulting in a panic for direct callers of
arch_fast_hash2 on older CPUs lacking sse4_2.  It is possible that
__intel_crc4_2_hash works merely by chance because it uses fewer
registers.

	This commit was suggested as the source of the problem by Jesse
Gross <jesse@nicira.com>.
