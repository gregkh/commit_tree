pinctrl: rockchip: Don't call pinctrl_gpio_direction_output() in pin_config_set()

The Rockchip pinctrl driver was calling
rockchip_gpio_direction_output() in the pin_config_set() callback.
This was just a shortcut for:
* rockchip_gpio_set()
* pinctrl_gpio_direction_output()

Unfortunately it's not so good to call pinctrl_gpio_direction_output()
from pin_config_set().  Specifically when initting hogs you'll get an
error.

Let's refactor a little so we can call
_rockchip_pmx_gpio_set_direction() directly.
