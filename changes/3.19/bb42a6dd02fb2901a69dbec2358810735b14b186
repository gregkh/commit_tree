IPoIB: Make ipoib_mcast_stop_thread flush the workqueue

We used to pass a flush variable to mcast_stop_thread to indicate if
we should flush the workqueue or not.  This was due to some code
trying to flush a workqueue that it was currently running on which is
a no-no.  Now that we have per-device work queues, and now that
ipoib_mcast_restart_task has taken the fact that it is queued on a
single thread workqueue with all of the ipoib_mcast_join_task's and
therefore has no need to stop the join task while it runs, we can do
away with the flush parameter and unilaterally flush always.
