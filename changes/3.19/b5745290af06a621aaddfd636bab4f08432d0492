staging: vt6655: vnt_tx_packet Fix corrupted tx packets.

Move PSTxDesc->m_td1TD1 to inside spin locks.

if m_td1TD1.byTCR has TCR_EDP and TCR_STP are set, the interrupt handler will
try and complete the buffer before it is completed. Usually on the tail
of a burst of tx packets.

This results in a partially completed packet being transmitted or worse
sitll dead lock when skb is freed by the interrupt handler.

Set head_td->m_td1TD1.byTCR to 0 in first lock of vnt_tx_packet to stop
interrupt handler completing the buffer. Move Set TSR1 & ReqCount in
s_cbFillTxBufHead to the second lock.

cbReqCount is carried to the second lock in pTDInfo->dwReqCount without
the padding removed.
