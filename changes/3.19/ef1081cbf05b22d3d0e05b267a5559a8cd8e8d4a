atari_NCR5380: Refactor Falcon special cases

Make the atari_NCR5380.c core driver usable by sun3_scsi, mac_scsi and
others by moving some of the Falcon-specific code out of the core driver:
!IS_A_TT, atari_read_overruns and falcon_dont_release. Replace these with
hostdata variables and flags. FLAG_CHECK_LAST_BYTE_SENT is unused in
atari_NCR5380.c so don't set it.
