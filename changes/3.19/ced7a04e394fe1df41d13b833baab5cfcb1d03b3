pkt_sched: fq: increase max delay from 125 ms to one second

FQ/pacing has a clamp of delay of 125 ms, to avoid some possible harm.

It turns out this delay is too small to allow pacing low rates :
Some ISP setup very aggressive policers as low as 16kbit.

Now TCP stack has spurious rtx prevention, it seems safe to increase
this fixed parameter, without adding a qdisc attribute.
