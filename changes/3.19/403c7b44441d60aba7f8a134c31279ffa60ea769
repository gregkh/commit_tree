sunrpc: fix potential races in pool_stats collection

In a later patch, we'll be removing some spinlocking around the socket
and thread queueing code in order to fix some contention problems. At
that point, the stats counters will no longer be protected by the
sp_lock.

Change the counters to atomic_long_t fields, except for the
"sockets_queued" counter which will still be manipulated under a
spinlock.
