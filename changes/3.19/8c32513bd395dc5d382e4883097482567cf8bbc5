ncr5380: Cleanup host info() methods

If the host->info() method is not set, then host->name is used by default.
For atari_scsi, that is exactly the same text. So remove the redundant
info() method. Keep sun3_scsi.c in line with atari_scsi.

Some NCR5380 drivers return an empty string from the info() method
(arm/cumana_1.c arm/oak.c mac_scsi.c) while other drivers use the default
(dmx3191d dtc.c g_NCR5380.c pas16.c t128.c).

Implement a common info() method to replace a lot of duplicated code which
the various drivers use to announce the same information.

This replaces most of the (deprecated) show_info() output and all of the
NCR5380_print_info() output. This also eliminates a bunch of code in
g_NCR5380 which just duplicates functionality in the core driver.
