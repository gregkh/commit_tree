arm64: optimize memcpy_{from,to}io() and memset_io()

Optimize memcpy_{from,to}io() and memset_io() by transferring in 64 bit
as much as possible with minimized barrier usage.  This simplest
optimization brings faster throughput compare to current byte-by-byte read
and write with barrier in the loop.  Code's skeleton is taken from the
powerpc.
