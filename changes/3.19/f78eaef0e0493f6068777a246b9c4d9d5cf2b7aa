perf tools: Allow to force redirect pr_debug to stderr.

When debugging the tui browser I find it useful to redirect the debug
log into a file. Currently it's always forced to the message line.

Add an option to force it to stderr. Then it can be easily redirected.

Example:

  [root@zoo ~]# perf --debug stderr report -vv 2> /tmp/debug
  [root@zoo ~]# tail /tmp/debug
  dso open failed, mmap: No such file or directory
  dso open failed, mmap: No such file or directory
  dso open failed, mmap: No such file or directory
  dso open failed, mmap: No such file or directory
  dso open failed, mmap: No such file or directory
