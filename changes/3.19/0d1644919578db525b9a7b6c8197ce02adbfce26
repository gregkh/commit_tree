batman-adv: avoid NULL dereferences and fix if check

Gateway having bandwidth_down equal to zero are not accepted
at all and so never added to the Gateway list.
For this reason checking the bandwidth_down member in
batadv_gw_out_of_range() is useless.

This is probably a copy/paste error and this check was supposed
to be "!gw_node" only. Moreover, the way the check is written
now may also lead to a NULL dereference.

Fix this by rewriting the if-condition properly.
