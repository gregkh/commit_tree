rcu: Use DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED for rcu_data

The rcu_data per-CPU variable has a number of fields that are atomically
manipulated, potentially by any CPU.  This situation can result in false
sharing with per-CPU variables that have the misfortune of being allocated
adjacent to rcu_data in memory.  This commit therefore changes the
DEFINE_PER_CPU() to DEFINE_PER_CPU_SHARED_ALIGNED() in order to avoid
this false sharing.
