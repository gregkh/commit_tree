perf tools: Fix build-id matching on vmlinux

There's a problem on finding correct kernel symbols when perf report
runs on a different kernel.  Although a part of the problem was solved
by the prior commit 0a7e6d1b6844 ("perf tools: Check recorded kernel
version when finding vmlinux"), there's a remaining problem still.

When perf records samples, it synthesizes the kernel map using
machine__mmap_name() and ref_reloc_sym like "[kernel.kallsyms]_text".
You can easily see it using 'perf report -D' command.

After finishing record, it goes through the recorded events to find
maps/dsos actually used.  And then record build-id info of them.

During this process, it needs to load symbols in a dso and it'd call
dso__load_vmlinux_path() since the default value of the symbol_conf.
try_vmlinux_path is true.  However it changes dso->long_name to a real
path of the vmlinux file (e.g. /lib/modules/3.16.4/build/vmlinux) if one
is running on a custom kernel.

It resulted in that perf report reads the build-id of the vmlinux, but
cannot use it since it only knows about the [kernel.kallsyms] map.  It
then falls back to possible vmlinux paths by using the recorded kernel
version (in case of a recent version) or a running kernel silently.

Even with the recent tools, this still has a possibility of breaking
the result.  As the build directory is a symbolic link, if one built a
new kernel in the same directory with different source/config, the old
link to vmlinux will point the new file.  So it's absolutely needed to
use build-id when finding a kernel image.

In this patch, it's now changed to try to search a kernel dso in the
existing dso list which was constructed during build-id table parsing
so it'll always have a build-id.  If not found, search "[kernel.kallsyms]".
