ALSA: oxfw: add support for capturing PCM samples

In previous commit, a support for transmitted packets is added. This commit
add a support for capturing PCM samples.

When any streams are already started, this driver should not change sampling
rate of the device, thus this commit also adds a restriction of sampling rate
in this situation.
