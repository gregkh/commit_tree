ACPI / table: Always count matched and successfully parsed entries

acpi_parse_entries() allows to traverse all available table entries (aka
subtables) by passing max_entries parameter equal to 0, but since its count
variable is only incremented if max_entries is not 0, the function always
returns 0 for max_entries equal to 0.  It would be more useful if it returned
the number of entries matched instead, so make it increment count in that
case too.
