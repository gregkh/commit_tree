Revert "tty: Fix pty master poll() after slave closes v2"

This reverts commit c4dc304677e8d566572c4738d95c48be150c6606.
This fix is superseded by commit 52bce7f8d4fc633c9a9d0646eef58ba6ae9a3b73,
'pty, n_tty: Simplify input processing on final close'.

The final close now waits for input processing to complete before
destroying the pty, so poll() does not need to special case this
condition.
