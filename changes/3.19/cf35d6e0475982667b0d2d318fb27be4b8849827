misc: genwqe: check for error from get_user_pages_fast()

`genwqe_user_vmap()` calls `get_user_pages_fast()` and if the return
value is less than the number of pages requested, it frees the pages and
returns an error (`-EFAULT`).  However, it fails to consider a negative
error return value from `get_user_pages_fast()`.  In that case, the test
`if (rc < m->nr_pages)` will be false (due to promotion of `rc` to a
large `unsigned int`) and the code will continue on to call
`genwqe_map_pages()` with an invalid list of page pointers.  Fix it by
bailing out if `get_user_pages_fast()` returns a negative error value.
