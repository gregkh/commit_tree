x86, microcode: Reload microcode on resume

Normally, we do reapply microcode on resume. However, in the cases where
that microcode comes from the early loader and the late loader hasn't
been utilized yet, there's no easy way for us to go and apply the patch
applied during boot by the early loader.

Thus, reuse the patch stashed by the early loader for the BSP.
