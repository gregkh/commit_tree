mm: memcontrol: remove obsolete kmemcg pinning tricks

As charges now pin the css explicitely, there is no more need for kmemcg
to acquire a proxy reference for outstanding pages during offlining, or
maintain state to identify such "dead" groups.

This was the last user of the uncharge functions' return values, so remove
them as well.
