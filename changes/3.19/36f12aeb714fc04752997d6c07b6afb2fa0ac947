dm thin: implement thin_merge

Introduce thin_merge so that any additional constraints from the data
volume may be taken into account when determing the maximum number of
sectors that can be issued relative to the specified logical offset.

This is particularly important if/when the data volume is layered ontop
of a more sophisticated device (e.g. dm-raid or some other DM target).
