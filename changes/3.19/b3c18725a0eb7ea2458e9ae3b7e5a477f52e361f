powerpc/ftrace: simplify prepare_ftrace_return

Instead of passing in the stack address of the link register
to be modified, just pass in the old value and return the
new value and rely on ftrace_graph_caller to do the
modification.

This removes the exception handling around the stack update -
it isn't needed and we weren't consistent about it. Later on
we would do an unprotected modification:

       if (!ftrace_graph_entry(&trace)) {
               *parent = old;
