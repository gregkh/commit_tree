drm/nouveau: implement explicitly coherent BOs

Allow nouveau_bo_new() to recognize the TTM_PL_FLAG_UNCACHED flag, which
means that we want the allocated BO to be perfectly coherent between the
CPU and GPU. This is useful on non-coherent architectures for which we
do not want to manually sync some rarely-accessed buffers: typically,
fences and pushbuffers.

A TTM BO allocated with the TTM_PL_FLAG_UNCACHED on a non-coherent
architecture will be populated using the DMA API, and accesses to it
performed using the coherent mapping performed by dma_alloc_coherent().
