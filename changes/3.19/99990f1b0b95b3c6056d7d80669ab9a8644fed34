drm/i915: remove the IRQs enabled WARN from intel_disable_gt_powersave

This function can be called now with i915 interrupts enabled, so the
corresponding WARN is incorrect, remove it. I think this was spotted by
Paulo during his review, but since I already removed the same WARN
from intel_suspend_gt_powersave() I missed then his point.
