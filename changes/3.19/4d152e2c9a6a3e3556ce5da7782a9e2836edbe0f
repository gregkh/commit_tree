sunrpc: add a generic rq_flags field to svc_rqst and move rq_secure to it

In a later patch, we're going to need some atomic bit flags. Since that
field will need to be an unsigned long, we mitigate that space
consumption by migrating some other bitflags to the new field. Start
with the rq_secure flag.
