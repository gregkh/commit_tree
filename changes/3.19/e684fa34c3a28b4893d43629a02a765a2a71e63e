i40e: only warn once of PTP nonsupport in 100Mbit speed

Only warn once that PTP is not supported when linked at 100Mbit.

Yes, using a static this way means that this once-only message is not
port specific, but once only for the life of the driver, regardless of
the number of ports.  That should be plenty.
