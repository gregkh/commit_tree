[media] rcar_vin: Update device_caps and capabilities in querycap

The V4L2 API requires both .capabilities and .device_caps fields of
struct v4l2_capability to be set. Otherwise the compliance checker
complains and since commit "v4l2-ioctl: WARN_ON if querycap didn't fill
device_caps" a compile-time warning is issued. Fix this non-compliance
in the rcar_vin driver.
