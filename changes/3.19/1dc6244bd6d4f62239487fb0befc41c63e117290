printk: remove used-once early_vprintk

Eliminate the unlikely possibility of message interleaving for
early_printk/early_vprintk use.

early_vprintk can be done via the %pV extension so remove this
unnecessary function and change early_printk to have the equivalent
vprintk code.

All uses of early_printk already end with a newline so also remove the
unnecessary newline from the early_printk function.
