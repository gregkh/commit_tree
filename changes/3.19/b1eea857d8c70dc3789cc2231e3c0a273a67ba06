ACPI / PMIC: support PMIC operation region for CrystalCove

The Baytrail-T platform firmware has defined two customized operation
regions for PMIC chip Crystal Cove - one is for power resource handling
and one is for thermal: sensor temperature reporting, trip point setting,
etc. This patch adds support for them on top of the existing Crystal Cove
PMIC driver.

The reason to split code into a separate file intel_pmic.c is that there
are more PMIC drivers with ACPI operation region support coming and we can
re-use those code. The intel_pmic_opregion_data structure is created also
for this purpose: when we need to support a new PMIC's operation region,
we just need to fill those callbacks and the two register mapping tables.
