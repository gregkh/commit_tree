iwlwifi: mvm: check and report if wake up was due to net detect

Query the firmware for scan offload matches when waking up in order to
report net detect as the reason for the wake up.

This requires a new command API to be implemented.  Additionally,
remove some net detect command entries that are not valid anymore.
