arm64: bpf: lift restriction on last instruction

Earlier implementation assumed last instruction is BPF_EXIT.
Since this is no longer a restriction in eBPF, we remove this
limitation.

Per Alexei Starovoitov [1]:
> classic BPF has a restriction that last insn is always BPF_RET.
> eBPF doesn't have BPF_RET instruction and this restriction.
> It has BPF_EXIT insn which can appear anywhere in the program
> one or more times and it doesn't have to be last insn.
