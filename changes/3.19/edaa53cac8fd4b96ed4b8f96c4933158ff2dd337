ext4: change LRU to round-robin in extent status tree shrinker

In this commit we discard the lru algorithm for inodes with extent
status tree because it takes significant effort to maintain a lru list
in extent status tree shrinker and the shrinker can take a long time to
scan this lru list in order to reclaim some objects.

We replace the lru ordering with a simple round-robin.  After that we
never need to keep a lru list.  That means that the list needn't be
sorted if the shrinker can not reclaim any objects in the first round.
