dm thin: fix inability to discard blocks when in out-of-data-space mode

When the pool was in PM_OUT_OF_SPACE mode its process_prepared_discard
function pointer was incorrectly being set to
process_prepared_discard_passdown rather than process_prepared_discard.

This incorrect function pointer meant the discard was being passed down,
but not effecting the mapping.  As such any discard that was issued, in
an attempt to reclaim blocks, would not successfully free data space.
