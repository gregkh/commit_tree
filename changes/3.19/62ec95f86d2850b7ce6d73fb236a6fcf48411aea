staging, rtl8192e, LLVMLinux: Remove unused inline prototype

rtllib_probe_req is defined as "static inline" in rtllib_softmac.c however it
is declared differently as "extern inline" in rtllib_softmac.h. Since it isn't
used outside of the scope of rtllib_softmac, it makes sense to remove the
incorrect declaration.
