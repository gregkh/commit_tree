i2c: davinci: don't use interruptible completion

When a signal is caught while the i2c-davinci bus driver is
transferring, the driver just "abandons" the transfer and leaves the
controller to fend for itself. The next I2C transaction will find the
controller in an undefined state and often results in a stream of
"initiating i2c bus recovery" messages until the controller arrives in a
defined state. This behaviour also sends out "half" or possibly even
mixed messages to I2C client devices which may put them in an undesired
state as well. So, let's get simply uninterruptible.
