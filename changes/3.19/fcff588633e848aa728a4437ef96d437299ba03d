arm64: Treat handle_arch_irq as a function pointer

handle_arch_irq isn't actually text, it's just a function pointer.
It doesn't need to be stored in the text section and doing so
causes problesm if we ever want to make the kernel text read only.
Declare handle_arch_irq as a proper function pointer stored in
the data section.
