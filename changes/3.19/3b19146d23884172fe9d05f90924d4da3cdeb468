Bluetooth: Add basic support for sending our LE SC public key

When the initial pairing request & response PDUs have been exchanged and
both have had the LE SC bit set the next step is to generate a ECDH
key pair and to send the public key to the remote side. This patch adds
basic support for generating the key pair and sending the public key
using the new Public Key SMP PDU. It is the initiating device that sends
the public key first and the non-initiating device responds by sending
its public key respectively (in a subsequent patch).
