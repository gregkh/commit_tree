xen-netback: remove unconditional __pskb_pull_tail() in guest Tx path

Unconditionally pulling 128 bytes into the linear area is not required
for:

- security: Every protocol demux starts with pskb_may_pull() to pull
  frag data into the linear area, if necessary, before looking at
  headers.

- performance: Netback has already grant copied up-to 128 bytes from
  the first slot of a packet into the linear area. The first slot
  normally contain all the IPv4/IPv6 and TCP/UDP headers.

The unconditional pull would often copy frag data unnecessarily.  This
is a performance problem when running on a version of Xen where grant
unmap avoids TLB flushes for pages which are not accessed.  TLB
flushes can now be avoided for > 99% of unmaps (it was 0% before).

Grant unmap TLB flush avoidance will be available in a future version
of Xen (probably 4.6).
