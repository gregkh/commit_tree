drbd: Fix state change in case of connection timeout

A connection timeout affects all volumes of a resource!
Under the following conditions:

 A resource with multiple volumes
  AND
 ko-count >=1
  AND
 a write request triggers the timeout (ko-count * timeout)

DRBD's internal state gets confused. That in turn may
lead to very miss leading follow up failures. E.g.
"BUG: scheduling while atomic"
