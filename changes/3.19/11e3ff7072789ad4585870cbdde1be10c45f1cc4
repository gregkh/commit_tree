6lowpan: Use skb_cow in IPHC decompression.

Currently there are potentially 2 skb_copy_expand calls in IPHC
decompression.  This patch replaces this with one call to
skb_cow which will check to see if there is enough headroom
first to ensure it's only done if necessary and will handle
alignment issues for cache.
As skb_cow uses pskb_expand_head we ensure the skb isn't shared from
bluetooth and ieee802.15.4 code that use the IPHC decompression.
