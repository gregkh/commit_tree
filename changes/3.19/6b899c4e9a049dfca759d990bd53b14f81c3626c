binfmt_misc: add comments & debug logs

When trying to develop a custom format handler, the errors returned all
effectively get bucketed as EINVAL with no kernel messages.  The other
errors (ENOMEM/EFAULT) are internal/obvious and basic.  Thus any time a
bad handler is rejected, the developer has to walk the dense code and
try to guess where it went wrong.  Needing to dive into kernel code is
itself a fairly high barrier for a lot of people.

To improve this situation, let's deploy extensive pr_debug markers at
logical parse points, and add comments to the dense parsing logic.  It
let's you see exactly where the parsing aborts, the string the kernel
received (useful when dealing with shell code), how it translated the
buffers to binary data, and how it will apply the mask at runtime.

Some example output:
  $ echo ':qemu-foo:M::\x7fELF\xAD\xAD\x01\x00:\xff\xff\xff\xff\xff\x00\xff\x00:/usr/bin/qemu-foo:POC' > register
  $ dmesg

The [raw] lines show us exactly what was received from userspace.  The
lines after that show us how the kernel has decoded things.
