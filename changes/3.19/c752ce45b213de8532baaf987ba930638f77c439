iommu/arm-smmu: add support for DOMAIN_ATTR_NESTING attribute

When domains are set with the DOMAIN_ATTR_NESTING flag, we must ensure
that we allocate them to stage-2 context banks if the hardware permits
it.

This patch adds support for the attribute to the ARM SMMU driver, with
the actual stage being determined depending on the features supported
by the hardware.
