ethernet/intel: Use eth_skb_pad and skb_put_padto helpers

Update the Intel Ethernet drivers to use eth_skb_pad() and skb_put_padto
instead of doing their own implementations of the function.

Also this cleans up two other spots where skb_pad was called but the length
and tail pointers were being manipulated directly instead of just having
the padding length added via __skb_put.
