i40evf: make early init processing more robust

In early init, if we get an unexpected message from the PF (such as link
status), we just kick an error back to the init task, causing it to
restart its state machine and delaying initialization.

Make the early init AQ message receive code more robust by handling
messages in a loop, and ignoring those that we aren't interested in.
This also gets rid of some scary log messages that really didn't
indicate a problem.
