tty: Allow safe access to termios for set_ldisc() handlers

Allow a tty driver to safely access termios settings while handling
the set_ldisc() notification. UART drivers use the set_ldisc()
notification to check if the N_PPS line discipline is being enabled;
if so, modem status interrupts may also need to be enabled. Conversely,
modem status interrupts may need to be disabled if switching away
from the N_PPS line discipline.
