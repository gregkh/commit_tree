ARM: 8266/1: Remove early stack deallocation from restore_user_regs

Currently restore_user_regs deallocates the SVC stack early in
its execution and relies on no exception being taken between
the deallocation and the registers being restored. The introduction
of a default FIQ handler that also uses the SVC stack breaks this
assumption and can result in corrupted register state.

This patch works around the problem by removing the early
stack deallocation and using r2 as a temporary instead. I have
not found a way to do this without introducing an extra mov
instruction to the macro.
