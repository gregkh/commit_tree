drm/dsi: Add message to packet translator

This commit introduces a new function, mipi_dsi_create_packet(), which
converts from a MIPI DSI message to a MIPI DSI packet. The MIPI DSI
packet is as close to the protocol described in the DSI specification as
possible and useful in drivers that need to write a DSI packet into a
FIFO to send a message off to the peripheral.
