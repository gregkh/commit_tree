eeprom: at24: extend driver to allow writing via i2c_smbus_write_byte_data

I have a at24 EEPROM connected via i2c bus provided by ISCH i2c
bus driver. This bus driver does not support
I2C_FUNC_SMBUS_WRITE_I2C_BLOCK and so I was looking for a way
to be able to write the eeprom. This patch adds support for
I2C_SMBUS_BYTE_DATA writing via i2c_smbus_write_byte_data.
It is quite slow, but it works.
