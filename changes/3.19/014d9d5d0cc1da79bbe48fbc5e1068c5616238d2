ACPI/int340x_thermal: enumerate INT3401 for Intel SoC DTS thermal driver

Intel SoC DTS thermal driver on Baytrail platform uses IRQ 86 for
critical overheating notification.
But this IRQ 86 is described in the _CRS control method of INT3401 device,
thus we should enumerate INT3401 to set the IRQ descriptor when
Intel SoC DTS thermal driver is built.
