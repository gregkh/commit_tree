ipc/sem.c: increase SEMMSL, SEMMNI, SEMOPM

a)

SysV can be abused to allocate locked kernel memory.  For most systems, a
small limit doesn't make sense, see the discussion with regards to SHMMAX.

Therefore: Increase the sysv sem limits so that all known applications
will work with these defaults.

b)

With regards to the maximum supported:
Some of the specified hard limits are not correct anymore, therefore the
patch updates the documentation.

- SEMMNI must stay below IPCMNI, which is 32768.
  As for SHMMAX: Stay a bit below this limit.

- SEMMSL was limited to 8k, to ensure that the kmalloc for the kernel array
  was limited to 16 kB (order=2)

  This doesn't apply anymore:
   - the allocation size isn't sizeof(short)*nsems anymore.
   - ipc_alloc falls back to vmalloc

- SEMOPM should stay below 1000, to limit the kmalloc in semtimedop() to an
  order=1 allocation.
  Therefore: Leave it at 500 (order=0 allocation).

Note:
If an administrator must limit the memory allocations, then he can set the
values as necessary.

Or he can disable sysv entirely (as e.g. done by Android).
