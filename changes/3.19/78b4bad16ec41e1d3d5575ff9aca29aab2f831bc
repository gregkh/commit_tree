mac802154: set short address filter on ifup

This patch moves the setting of hardware short address filtering
inside of interface up instead doing it it directly inside of netlink
interface. The netlink call which can only be called when netif isn't
running sets only the necessary short_addr value in sdata. After an
interface up the address filter will be set with this value.
