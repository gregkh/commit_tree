KVM: s390: handle pending local interrupts via bitmap

This patch adapts handling of local interrupts to be more compliant with
the z/Architecture Principles of Operation and introduces a data
structure
which allows more efficient handling of interrupts.

* get rid of li->active flag, use bitmap instead
* Keep interrupts in a bitmap instead of a list
* Deliver interrupts in the order of their priority as defined in the
  PoP
* Use a second bitmap for sigp emergency requests, as a CPU can have
  one request pending from every other CPU in the system.
