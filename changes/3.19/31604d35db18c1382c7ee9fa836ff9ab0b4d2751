ALSA: emu10k1: Deletion of unnecessary checks before three function calls

The functions kfree(), release_firmware() and snd_util_memhdr_free() test
whether their argument is NULL and then return immediately. Thus the test
around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
