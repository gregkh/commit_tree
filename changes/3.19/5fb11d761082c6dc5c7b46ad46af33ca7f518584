i40e: get pf_id from HW rather than PCI function

Getting the pf_id from the function number was a good place to start,
but when the PF was setup in passthru mode, the PCI bus/device/function
was virtualized and the number in the VM is different from the number in
the bare metal.  This caused HW configuration issues when the wrong pf_id
was used to set up the HMC and other structures.  The PF_FUNC_RID register
has the real bus/device/function information as configured by the BIOS,
so use that for a better number.  This works in NPAR mode as well.
