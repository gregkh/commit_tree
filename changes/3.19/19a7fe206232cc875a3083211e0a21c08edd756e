tracing: Add trace_seq_has_overflowed() and trace_handle_return()

Adding a trace_seq_has_overflowed() which returns true if the trace_seq
had too much written into it allows us to simplify the code.

Instead of checking the return value of every call to trace_seq_printf()
and friends, they can all be called normally, and at the end we can
return !trace_seq_has_overflowed() instead.

Several functions also return TRACE_TYPE_PARTIAL_LINE when the trace_seq
overflowed and TRACE_TYPE_HANDLED otherwise. Another helper function
was created called trace_handle_return() which takes a trace_seq and
returns these enums. Using this helper function also simplifies the
code.

This change also makes it possible to remove the return values of
trace_seq_printf() and friends. They should instead just be
void functions.
