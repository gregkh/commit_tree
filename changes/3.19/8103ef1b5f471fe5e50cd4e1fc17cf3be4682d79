drm/exynos/mixer: embed manager into private context

exynos_drm_manager is used by internal Exynos DRM framework for
representing crtc. As it should be mapped 1:1 to fimd private context
it seems more reasonable to embed it directly in that context.
As a result further code simplification will be possible.
Moreover it will be possible to handle multiple mixer devices in the system.
