ASoC: Remove platform field from snd_soc_dai

Typically a DAI does not need direct access to the platform. Currently the
only user of this field is in a platform driver where we have a more direct
way of getting a pointer to the platform. This patch updates the driver to
use the more direct way and then removes the platform field from the
snd_soc_dai struct.
