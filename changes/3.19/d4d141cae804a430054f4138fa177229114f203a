mac80211: minstrel_ht: Increase the range of handled rate indexes

Since 5935839ad735 ("mac80211: improve minstrel_ht rate sorting by
throughput & probability"), the rate indexes are manipulated via u8's
and hence allow for a maximum of 256 mcs_group entries in
minstrel_mcs_groups.

ATM, minstrel_ht advertizes support up to 3HTSS@40MHz, consuming:
8(MCS_GROUP_RATES) * (3(SS)*2(GI)*2(BW)+1(CCK)), i.e. 104 entries.

Support for 3VHTSS@80MHz will require:
10(MCS_GROUP_RATES) * (3(SS)*2(GI)*2(BW)+1(CCK)) +
10(MCS_GROUP_RATES) * (3(SS)*2(GI)*3(BW)), i.e. 130 + 180 entries.

This change moves from u8s to u16s where necessary.
