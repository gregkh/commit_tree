arm/arm64: KVM: vgic: move reset initialization into vgic_init_maps()

VGIC initialization currently happens in three phases:
 (1) kvm_vgic_create() (triggered by userspace GIC creation)
 (2) vgic_init_maps() (triggered by userspace GIC register read/write
     requests, or from kvm_vgic_init() if not already run)
 (3) kvm_vgic_init() (triggered by first VM run)

We were doing initialization of some state to correspond with the
state of a freshly-reset GIC in kvm_vgic_init(); this is too late,
since it will overwrite changes made by userspace using the
register access APIs before the VM is run. Move this initialization
earlier, into the vgic_init_maps() phase.

This fixes a bug where QEMU could successfully restore a saved
VM state snapshot into a VM that had already been run, but could
not restore it "from cold" using the -loadvm command line option
(the symptoms being that the restored VM would run but interrupts
were ignored).

Finally rename vgic_init_maps to vgic_init and renamed kvm_vgic_init to
kvm_vgic_map_resources.

  [ This patch is originally written by Peter Maydell, but I have
    modified it somewhat heavily, renaming various bits and moving code
    around.  If something is broken, I am to be blamed. - Christoffer ]
