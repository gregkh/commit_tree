PCI: Expose pci_load_saved_state for public consumption.

We have the pci_load_and_free_saved_state, and pci_store_saved_state
but are missing the functionality to just load the state
multiple times in the PCI device without having to free/save
the state.

This patch makes it possible to use this function.
