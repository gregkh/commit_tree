[media] img-ir/hw: Always read data to clear buffer

A problem was found on Polaris where if the unit it booted via the power
button on the infrared remote then the next button press on the remote
would return the key code used to power on the unit.

The sequence is:
 - The polaris powered off but with the powerdown controller (PDC) block
   still powered.
 - Press power key on remote, IR block receives the key.
 - Kernel starts, IR code is in IMG_IR_DATA_x but neither IMG_IR_RXDVAL
   or IMG_IR_RXDVALD2 are set.
 - Wait any amount of time.
 - Press any key.
 - IMG_IR_RXDVAL or IMG_IR_RXDVALD2 is set but IMG_IR_DATA_x is
   unchanged since the powerup key data was never read.

This is worked around by always reading the IMG_IR_DATA_x in
img_ir_set_decoder(), rather than only when the IMG_IR_RXDVAL or
IMG_IR_RXDVALD2 bit is set.
