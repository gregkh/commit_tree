clk: rockchip: fix rk3066 pll lock bit location

The bit locations indicating the locking status of the plls on rk3066 are
shifted by one to the right when compared to the rk3188, bits [7:4] instead
of [8:5] on the rk3188, thus indicating the locking state of the wrong pll
or a completely different information in case of the gpll.

The recently introduced pll init code exposed that problem on some rk3066
boards when it tried to bring the boot-pll value in line with the value
from the rate table.

Fix this by defining separate pll definitions for rk3066 with the correct
locking indices.
