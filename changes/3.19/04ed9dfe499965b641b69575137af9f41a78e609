ath10k: fix possible bmi crash

While testing other things I've found that CE
items aren't cleared properly. This could lead to
null dereferences in BMI.

To prevent that make sure CE revoking clears the
nbytes value (which is used as a buffer completion
indication) and memset the entire CE ring data
shared between host and target when
(re)initializing.

Also make sure to check BMI xfer pointer and print
a splat instead of crashing the kernel.
