powerpc/eeh: Set EEH_PE_RESET on PE reset

The patch introduces additional flag EEH_PE_RESET to indicate the
corresponding PE is under reset. In turn, the PE retrieval bakcend
on PowerNV platform can return unfrozen state for the EEH core to
moving forward. Flag EEH_PE_CFG_BLOCKED isn't the correct one for
the purpose.

In PCI passthrou case, the problem is more worse: Guest doesn't
recover 6th EEH error. The PE is left in isolated (frozen) and
config blocked state on Broadcom adapters. We can't retrieve the
PE's state correctly any more, even from the host side via sysfs
/sys/bus/pci/devices/xxx/eeh_pe_state.
