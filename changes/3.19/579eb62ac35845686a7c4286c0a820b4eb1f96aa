ipvs: rerouting to local clients is not needed anymore

commit f5a41847acc5 ("ipvs: move ip_route_me_harder for ICMP")
from 2.6.37 introduced ip_route_me_harder() call for responses to
local clients, so that we can provide valid rt_src after SNAT.
It was used by TCP to provide valid daddr for ip_send_reply().
After commit 0a5ebb8000c5 ("ipv4: Pass explicit daddr arg to
ip_send_reply()." from 3.0 this rerouting is not needed anymore
and should be avoided, especially in LOCAL_IN.
