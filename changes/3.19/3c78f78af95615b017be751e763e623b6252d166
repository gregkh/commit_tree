KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Tracepoints for KVM HV guest interactions

This patch adds trace points in the guest entry and exit code and also
for exceptions handled by the host in kernel mode - hypercalls and page
faults. The new events are added to /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events
under a new subsystem called kvm_hv.
