s390/debug: avoid function call for debug_sprintf_*

debug_sprintf_event/exception are called even for debug events
with a disabling debug level. All other functions already do
the check in a wrapper function. Lets do the same here.
Due to the var_args the compiler rejects to make this function
inline. So let's wrap this via a macro.
This patch saves around 80 ns on my z196 for a KVM round trip (we
have two debug statements for entry and exit) when KVM is build as
a module.
The savings for built-in drivers is smaller as we then avoid the
PLT overhead for a function call.
