MIPS: Octeon: Delete potentially dangerous feature checks

We should not need to read fuses during normal operation, also the current
code has issues with that (not safe for concurrent access). Since there
are no in-kernel users for these, just delete them. Drivers should
not need such OCTEON_HAS_FEATURE mechanism in any case, instead the
information should be passed via device tree.
