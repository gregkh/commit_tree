ring-buffer: Remove check of trace_seq_{puts,printf}() return values

Remove checking the return value of all trace_seq_puts(). It was wrong
anyway as only the last return value mattered. But as the trace_seq_puts()
is going to be a void function in the future, we should not be checking
the return value of it anyway.

Just return !trace_seq_has_overflowed() instead.
