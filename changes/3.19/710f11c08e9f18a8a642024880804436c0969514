Bluetooth: Use custom macro for testing BR/EDR SC enabled

Since the HCI_SC_ENABLED flag will also be used for controllers without
BR/EDR Secure Connections support whenever we need to check specifically
for SC for BR/EDR we also need to check that the controller actually
supports it. This patch adds a convenience macro for check all the
necessary conditions and converts the places in the code that need it to
use it.
