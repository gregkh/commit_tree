xen-netback: fixing the propagation of the transmit shaper timeout

Since e9ce7cb6b107 ("xen-netback: Factor queue-specific data into queue struct"),
the transimt shaper timeout is always set to 0.  The value the user sets via
xenbus is never propagated to the transmit shaper.

This patch fixes the issue.
