PM / clock_ops: Add pm_clk_add_clk()

The existing pm_clk_add() allows to pass a clock by con_id. However,
when referring to a specific clock from DT, no con_id is available.

Add pm_clk_add_clk(), which allows to specify the struct clk * directly.
The will will increment refcount on clock pointer, so the caller has
to use clk_put() on clock pointer when done.
