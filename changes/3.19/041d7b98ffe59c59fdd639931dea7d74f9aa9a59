audit: restore AUDIT_LOGINUID unset ABI

A regression was caused by commit 780a7654cee8:
	 audit: Make testing for a valid loginuid explicit.
(which in turn attempted to fix a regression caused by e1760bd)

When audit_krule_to_data() fills in the rules to get a listing, there was a
missing clause to convert back from AUDIT_LOGINUID_SET to AUDIT_LOGINUID.

This broke userspace by not returning the same information that was sent and
expected.

The rule:
	auditctl -a exit,never -F auid=-1
gives:
	auditctl -l
		LIST_RULES: exit,never f24=0 syscall=all
when it should give:
		LIST_RULES: exit,never auid=-1 (0xffffffff) syscall=all

Tag it so that it is reported the same way it was set.  Create a new
private flags audit_krule field (pflags) to store it that won't interact with
the public one from the API.
