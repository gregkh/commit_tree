Input: i8042 - reset keyboard to fix Elantech touchpad detection

On some laptops, keyboard needs to be reset in order to successfully detect
touchpad (e.g., some Gigabyte laptop models with Elantech touchpads).
Without resettin keyboard touchpad pretends to be completely dead.

Based on the original patch by Mateusz Jończyk this version has been
expanded to include DMI based detection & application of the fix
automatically on the affected models of laptops. This has been confirmed to
fix problem by three users already on three different models of laptops.
