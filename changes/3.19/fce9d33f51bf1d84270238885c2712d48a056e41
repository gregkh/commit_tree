mmc: sdhci: fix error conditions for controller reset

Add the case of SET_BLOCK_COUNT command error to the error conditions
check for making a controller reset at request handling finish.
Otherwise, if the SET_BLOCK_COUNT command failed, e.g. with a timeout,
the controller state was not reset, and the next command failed too.

In the case of data error the controller reset is already done in
finish_data() function before sending stop command (if present),
so the finish tasklet should make a reset after data error only
if no stop command existed in the request.

Also, fix the indentation of this condition check to make it more logical.
