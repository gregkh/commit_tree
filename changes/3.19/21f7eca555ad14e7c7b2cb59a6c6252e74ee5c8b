time: Provide y2038 safe do_settimeofday() replacement

The kernel uses 32-bit signed value(time_t) for seconds elapsed
1970-01-01:00:00:00, thus it will overflow at 2038-01-19 03:14:08
on 32-bit systems. This is widely known as the y2038 problem.

As part of addressing "y2038 problem" for in-kernel uses, this patch
adds safe do_settimeofday64() using timespec64.

After this patch, do_settimeofday() is deprecated and all its call
sites will be fixed using do_settimeofday64(), after that it can be
removed.
