arm/arm64: KVM: Require in-kernel vgic for the arch timers

It is curently possible to run a VM with architected timers support
without creating an in-kernel VGIC, which will result in interrupts from
the virtual timer going nowhere.

To address this issue, move the architected timers initialization to the
time when we run a VCPU for the first time, and then only initialize
(and enable) the architected timers if we have a properly created and
initialized in-kernel VGIC.

When injecting interrupts from the virtual timer to the vgic, the
current setup should ensure that this never calls an on-demand init of
the VGIC, which is the only call path that could return an error from
kvm_vgic_inject_irq(), so capture the return value and raise a warning
if there's an error there.

We also change the kvm_timer_init() function from returning an int to be
a void function, since the function always succeeds.
