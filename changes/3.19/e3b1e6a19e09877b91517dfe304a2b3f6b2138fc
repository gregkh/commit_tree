ASoC: dapm: Remove snd_soc_of_parse_audio_routing() due to deferred probe

This reverts commit f8781db8aeb18d (ASoC: dapm: Augment existing card
DAPM routes in snd_soc_of_parse_audio_routing) since it is broken for
deferred probing as it ends up storing data allocated with devm_ over
multiple instantiations of the device.
