PM: Drop CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME from the driver core

After commit b2b49ccbdd54 (PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if PM_SLEEP is
selected) PM_RUNTIME is always set if PM is set, so quite a few
depend on CONFIG_PM or even may be dropped entirely in some cases.

Replace CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME with CONFIG_PM in the PM core code.
