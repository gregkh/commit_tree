pinctrl: st: avoid multiple mutex lock

Using the sysfs inteface to inspect the pins configuration
the system can walk around a path which acquires the same
mutex twice.

On STiH407 platform, for example :
cat /sys/kernel/debug/pinctrl/920f080.pin-controller-front0/pinconf-pins
hangs the kernel and never returns.

With this patch the mutex is temporary freed.
