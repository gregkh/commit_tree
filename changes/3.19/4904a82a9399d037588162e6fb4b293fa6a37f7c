arm: mvebu: move Armada 370/XP pinctrl node definition armada-370-xp.dtsi

What was done by Sebastian in 264a05e19bf5 ("ARM: mvebu: armada-xp:
Add node alias to pinctrl and add base address") and 01c434225ee6
("ARM: mvebu: armada-xp: Use pinctrl node alias") can also be done for
Armada 370, i.e.

 - Rename Armada 370 pinctrl node to pin-ctrl with its address encoded
 - Add a node alias to access the pinctrl node easily.
 - use the newly available alias in existing Armada 370 .dts files

We can even go a bit further by putting the pinctrl node definition in
armada-370-xp.dtsi, with only its reg property defined. This allows us
to then also use the newly defined node alias in armada-xp.dtsi,
armada-370.dtsi.
