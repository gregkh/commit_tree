net: phy: spi_ks8995: remove sysfs bin file by registered attribute

When a sysfs binary file is asked to be removed, it is found by
attribute name, so strictly speaking this change is not a fix, but
just in case when attribute name is changed in the driver or sysfs
internals are changed, it might be better to remove the previously
created file using right the same binary attribute.
