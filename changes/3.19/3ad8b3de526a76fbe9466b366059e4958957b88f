arm/arm64: KVM: Correct KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT power off option

The implementation of KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT is currently not doing what
userspace expects, namely making sure that a vcpu which may have been
turned off using PSCI is returned to its initial state, which would be
powered on if userspace does not set the KVM_ARM_VCPU_POWER_OFF flag.

Implement the expected functionality and clarify the ABI.
