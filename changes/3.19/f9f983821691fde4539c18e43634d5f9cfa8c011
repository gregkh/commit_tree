staging: comedi: cb_pcidas: use comedi_async 'scans_done' to detect AI EOA

Remove the private data member 'count' and use the comedi_async 'scans_done'
member to detect the analog input end-of-acquisition.

Use the comedi_nsamples_left() helper to get the number of samples to actually
add to the async buffer.
