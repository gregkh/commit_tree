arm64: ptrace: allow tracer to skip a system call

If tracer modifies a syscall number to -1, this traced system call should
be skipped with a return value specified in x0.
This patch implements this semantics.

Please note:
* syscall entry tracing and syscall exit tracing (ftrace tracepoint and
  audit) are always executed, if enabled, even when skipping a system call
  (that is, -1).
  In this way, we can avoid a potential bug where audit_syscall_entry()
  might be called without audit_syscall_exit() at the previous system call
  being called, that would cause OOPs in audit_syscall_entry().
