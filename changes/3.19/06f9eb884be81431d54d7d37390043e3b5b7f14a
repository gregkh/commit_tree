arm64: Provide a namespace to NCAPS

Building arm64.allmodconfig leads to the following warning:

usb/gadget/function/f_ncm.c:203:0: warning: "NCAPS" redefined
 #define NCAPS (USB_CDC_NCM_NCAP_ETH_FILTER | USB_CDC_NCM_NCAP_CRC_MODE)

 #define NCAPS     2

So add a ARM64 prefix to avoid such problem.
