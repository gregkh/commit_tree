tty: bfin, define inlined structures

struct bfin_serial_port contains structs circ_buf, timer_list, and
work_struct directly (not pointers). This means that these structures
have to be defined completely to be inlined in struct
bfin_serial_port.

So instead of struct declarations, define the structures by including
proper headers. They were pulled in by linux/serial_core.h or others
until now. But experimenting with circ_buf removal from serial_core,
struct circ_buf becomes undefined in bfin_serial:
