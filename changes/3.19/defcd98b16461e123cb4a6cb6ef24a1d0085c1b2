ASoC: max98090: Different comp tables for different pclks

In addtion expand the table to handle other values of sysclk.  Instead
of making the table 3D, expand it to a more descriptive struct.  The
divisors are specified in Table 19 of the 98090 data sheet version
0p94.

The dmic frequency was previously assumed.  Instead make it explicit
and configurable through device tree.  This now handles independently
set pclk and dmic frequency.

Based on downstream work by Ralph Birt.
