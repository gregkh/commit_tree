seq-buf: Make seq_buf_bprintf() conditional on CONFIG_BINARY_PRINTF

The function bstr_printf() from lib/vsprnintf.c is only available if
CONFIG_BINARY_PRINTF is defined. This is due to the only user currently
being the tracing infrastructure, which needs to select this config
when tracing is configured. Until there is another user of the binary
printf formats, this will continue to be the case.

Since seq_buf.c is now lives in lib/ and is compiled even without
tracing, it must encompass its use of bstr_printf() which is used
by seq_buf_printf(). This too is only used by the tracing infrastructure
and is still encapsulated by the CONFIG_BINARY_PRINTF.
