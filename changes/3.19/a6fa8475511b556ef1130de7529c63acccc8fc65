arm: mvebu: define and use common Armada 370 SPI pinctrl settings

This patch defines common Armada 370 pinctrl settings for spi0 and spi1
interfaces:

 spi0: MPP33-36 as default, MPP32,63-65 as available alternate config
 spi1: MPP49-52 as default

Currently, the Armada 370 DB .dts file has no explicit pinctrl info
for the spi0 interface used to access the flash on the board. The
patch fixes that by also adding explicit pinctrl info (MPP32,63-65)
for this SPI interface.

Note: this patch has the potential to break out-of-tree users w/o
specific pinctrl settings for their spi interfaces if the default
above does not match their config.
