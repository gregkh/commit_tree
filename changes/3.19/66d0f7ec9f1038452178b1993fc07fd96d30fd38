sparc32: destroy_context() and switch_mm() needs to disable interrupts.

Load balancing can be triggered in the critical sections protected by
srmmu_context_spinlock in destroy_context() and switch_mm() and can hang
the cpu waiting for the rq lock of another cpu that in turn has called
switch_mm hangning on srmmu_context_spinlock leading to deadlock.

So, disable interrupt while taking srmmu_context_spinlock in
destroy_context() and switch_mm() so we don't deadlock.

interrupts.")
