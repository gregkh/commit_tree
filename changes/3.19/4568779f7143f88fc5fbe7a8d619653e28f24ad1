init/Kconfig: move RCU_NOCB_CPU dependencies to choice

Every choice item of the "Build-forced no-CBs CPUs" choice had a
dependency to RCU_NOCB_CPU.  It's more comprehensible if the choice
itself has the dependency instead of every choice item.  The choice
itself doesn't need to be visible if there are no items selectable
(i.e.  on arch/frv) or RCU_NOCB_CPU is not defined.
