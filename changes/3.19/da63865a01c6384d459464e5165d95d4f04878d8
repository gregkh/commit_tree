x86, microcode: Return error from driver init code when loader is disabled

Commits 65cef1311d5d ("x86, microcode: Add a disable chicken bit") and
a18a0f6850d4 ("x86, microcode: Don't initialize microcode code on
paravirt") allow microcode driver skip initialization when microcode
loading is not permitted.

However, they don't prevent the driver from being loaded since the
init code returns 0. If at some point later the driver gets unloaded
this will result in an oops while trying to deregister the (never
registered) device.

To avoid this, make init code return an error on paravirt or when
microcode loading is disabled. The driver will then never be loaded.
