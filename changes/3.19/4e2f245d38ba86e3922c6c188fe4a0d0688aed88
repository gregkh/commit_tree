mm: memcontrol: don't pass a NULL memcg to mem_cgroup_end_move()

mem_cgroup_end_move() checks if the passed memcg is NULL, along with a
lengthy comment to explain why this seemingly non-sensical situation is
even possible.

Check in cancel_attach() itself whether can_attach() set up the move
context or not, it's a lot more obvious from there.  Then remove the check
and comment in mem_cgroup_end_move().
