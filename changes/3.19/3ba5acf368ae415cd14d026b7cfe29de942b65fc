ARM: sa11x0: Use void __iomem * in MMIO accessors

MMIO accessors such as readl() and writel() want a void __iomem * for
the address. Update the BSE nanoEngine PCI driver to pass such pointers
instead of unsigned long in preparation to converting ARM to use generic
and more rigidly typed accessors.
