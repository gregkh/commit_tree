ACPI / processor: Rename acpi_(un)map_lsapic() to acpi_(un)map_cpu()

acpi_map_lsapic() will allocate a logical CPU number and map it to
physical CPU id (such as APIC id) for the hot-added CPU, it will also
do some mapping for NUMA node id and etc, acpi_unmap_lsapic() will
do the reverse.

We can see that the name of the function is a little bit confusing and
arch (IA64) dependent so rename them as acpi_(un)map_cpu() to make arch
agnostic and explicit.
