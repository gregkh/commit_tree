powernv/powerpc: Add winkle support for offline cpus

Winkle is a deep idle state supported in power8 chips. A core enters
winkle when all the threads of the core enter winkle. In this state
power supply to the entire chiplet i.e core, private L2 and private L3
is turned off. As a result it gives higher powersavings compared to
sleep.

But entering winkle results in a total hypervisor state loss. Hence the
hypervisor context has to be preserved before entering winkle and
restored upon wake up.

Power-on Reset Engine (PORE) is a dedicated engine which is responsible
for powering on the chiplet during wake up. It can be programmed to
restore the register contests of a few specific registers. This patch
uses PORE to restore register state wherever possible and uses stack to
save and restore rest of the necessary registers.

With hypervisor state restore things fall under three categories-
per-core state, per-subcore state and per-thread state. To manage this,
extend the infrastructure introduced for sleep. Mainly we add a paca
variable subcore_sibling_mask. Using this and the core_idle_state we can
distingush first thread in core and subcore.
