rcu: Remove "cpu" argument to rcu_check_callbacks()

The "cpu" argument was kept around on the off-chance that RCU might
offload scheduler-clock interrupts.  However, this offload approach
has been replaced by NO_HZ_FULL, which offloads -all- RCU processing
from qualifying CPUs.  It is therefore time to remove the "cpu" argument
to rcu_check_callbacks(), which this commit does.
