of: Eliminate of_allnodes list

The device tree structure is composed of two lists; the 'allnodes' list
which is a singly linked list containing every node in the tree, and the
child->parent structure where each parent node has a singly linked list
of children. All of the data in the allnodes list can be easily
reproduced with the parent-child lists, so of_allnodes is actually
unnecessary. Remove it entirely which saves a bit of memory and
simplifies the data structure quite a lot.
