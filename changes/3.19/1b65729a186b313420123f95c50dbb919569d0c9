[media] mach-omap2: remove deprecated VIDEO_OMAP2 support

The omap2 camera driver has been deprecated for a year and is now
going to be removed. It is unmaintained and it uses an internal API
that has long since been superseded by a much better API. Worse, that
internal API has been abused by out-of-kernel trees (i.MX6).

In addition, Sakari stated that these drivers have never been in a
usable state in the mainline kernel due to missing platform data.
