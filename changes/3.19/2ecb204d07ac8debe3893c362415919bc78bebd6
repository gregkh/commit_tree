scsi: always assign block layer tags if enabled

Allow a driver to ask for block layer tags by setting .use_blk_tags in the
host template, in which case it will always see a valid value in
request->tag, similar to the behavior when using blk-mq.  This means even
SCSI "untagged" commands will now have a tag, which is especially useful
when using a host-wide tag map.
