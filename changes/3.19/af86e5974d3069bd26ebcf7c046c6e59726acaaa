arm64: Factor out fixmap initialization from ioremap

The fixmap API was originally added for arm64 for
early_ioremap purposes. It can be used for other purposes too
so move the initialization from ioremap to somewhere more
generic. This makes it obvious where the fixmap is being set
up and allows for a cleaner implementation of __set_fixmap.
