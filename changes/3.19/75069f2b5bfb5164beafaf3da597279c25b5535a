vfs: renumber FMODE_NONOTIFY and add to uniqueness check

Fix clashing values for O_PATH and FMODE_NONOTIFY on sparc.  The
clashing O_PATH value was added in commit 5229645bdc35 ("vfs: add
nonconflicting values for O_PATH") but this can't be changed as it is
user-visible.

FMODE_NONOTIFY is only used internally in the kernel, but it is in the
same numbering space as the other O_* flags, as indicated by the comment
at the top of include/uapi/asm-generic/fcntl.h (and its use in
fs/notify/fanotify/fanotify_user.c).  So renumber it to avoid the clash.

All of this has happened before (commit 12ed2e36c98a: "fanotify:
FMODE_NONOTIFY and __O_SYNC in sparc conflict"), and all of this will
happen again -- so update the uniqueness check in fcntl_init() to
include __FMODE_NONOTIFY.
