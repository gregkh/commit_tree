umount: Disallow unprivileged mount force

Forced unmount affects not just the mount namespace but the underlying
superblock as well.  Restrict forced unmount to the global root user
for now.  Otherwise it becomes possible a user in a less privileged
mount namespace to force the shutdown of a superblock of a filesystem
in a more privileged mount namespace, allowing a DOS attack on root.
