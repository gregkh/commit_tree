serial: core: Pass termios to set_ldisc() notifications

UART drivers which enable modem status interrupts when switching
to N_PPS line discipline need to determine if modem status
interrupts should be disabled when switching from N_PPS.
Specifically, the set_ldisc() notification needs to evaluate
UART_ENABLE_MS() which requires termios->c_cflag.

Convert in-tree UART drivers to new interface.
