NFC: digital: Ensure no DID in NFC-DEP responses

When in Initiator mode, the digital layer's
NFC-DEP code always sets the Device ID (DID)
value in the ATR_REQ to '0'.  This means that
subsequent DEP_REQ and DEP_RES frames must
never include a DID byte.  This is specified
in sections 14.8.1.1 and 14.8.2.1 of the NFC
Digital Protocol Spec.

Currently, the digital layer's NFC-DEP code
doesn't enforce this rule so add code to ensure
that there is no DID byte in DEP_RES frames.
