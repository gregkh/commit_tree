amdkfd: Implement the create/destroy/update queue IOCTLs

v3: Removed the use of internal typedefs, fixed debug prints, added checks
    for parameters and moved to using doorbell address from user

v4: Extracted some of the code in the create queue ioctl to a different
    function that may be also called from other ioctls in the future.
    Also fixed the check of the ring size argument.

v5:

Add support for AQL queues creation to enable working with open-source HSA
runtime
