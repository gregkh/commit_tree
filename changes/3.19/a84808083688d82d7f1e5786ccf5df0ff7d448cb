perf tools: Only override the default :tid comm entry

Events may still be ordered even if there are no timestamps e.g. if the
data is recorded per-thread.

Also synthesized COMM events have a timestamp of zero.

Consequently it is better to keep comm entries even if they have a
timestamp of zero.

However, when a struct thread is created the command string is not known
and a comm entry with a string of the form ":<tid>" is used.

In that case thread->comm_set is false and the comm entry should be
overridden.
