dt-bindings: simplefb: Specify node location and handoff related properties

Since simplefb nodes do not relate directly to hw typically they have been
placed in the root of the devicetree. As the represent runtime information
having them as sub-nodes of /chosen is more logical, specify this.

Also specify when to set the chosen stdout-path property to a simplefb node.

For reliable handover to a hardware specific driver, that driver needs to
know which simplefb to unregister when taking over, specify how the hw driver
can find the matching simplefb node.

Last add some advice on how to fill and use simplefb nodes from a firmware
pov.
