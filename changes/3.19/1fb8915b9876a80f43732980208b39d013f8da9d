printk: Do not disable preemption for accessing printk_func

As printk_func will either be the default function, or a per_cpu function
for the current CPU, there's no reason to disable preemption to access
it from printk. That's because if the printk_func is not the default
then the caller had better disabled preemption as they were the one to
change it.
