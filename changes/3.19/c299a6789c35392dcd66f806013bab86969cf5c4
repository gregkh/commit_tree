staging: comedi: add ioctls to set per-file read and write subdevice

Now that Comedi has the structures in place to support setting the
current "read" and/or "write" subdevice on a per-file object basis, add
new ioctls to set them.  The newly chosen "read" ("write") subdevice
needs to support "read" ("write") commands, and the file cannot be busy
handling a "read" ("write") command on the previous subdevice (if any).
