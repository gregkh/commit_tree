ipc/shm.c: fix overly aggressive shmdt() when calls span multiple segments

This is a highly-contrived scenario.  But, a single shmdt() call can be
induced in to unmapping memory from mulitple shm segments.  Example code
is here:

The fix is pretty simple: Record the 'struct file' for the first VMA we
encounter and then stick to it.  Decline to unmap anything not from the
same file and thus the same segment.

I found this by inspection and the odds of anyone hitting this in practice
are pretty darn small.

Lightly tested, but it's a pretty small patch.
