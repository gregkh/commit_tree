ipv6: Remove BACKTRACK macro

It is the prep work to reduce the number of calls to fib6_lookup().

The BACKTRACK macro could be hard-to-read and error-prone due to
its side effects (mainly goto).

This patch is to:
1. Replace BACKTRACK macro with a function (fib6_backtrack) with the following
   return values:
   * If it is backtrack-able, returns next fn for retry.
   * If it reaches the root, returns NULL.
2. The caller needs to decide if a backtrack is needed (by testing
   rt == net->ipv6.ip6_null_entry).
3. Rename the goto labels in ip6_pol_route() to make the next few
   patches easier to read.
