amd64_edac: Add F15h M60h support

This patch adds support for ECC error decoding for F15h M60h processor.
Aside from the usual changes, the patch adds support for some new features
in the processor:
 - DDR4(unbuffered, registered); LRDIMM DDR3 support
   - relevant debug messages have been modified/added to report these
     memory types
 - new dbam_to_cs mappers
   - if (F15h M60h && LRDIMM); we need a 'multiplier' value to find
     cs_size. This multiplier value is obtained from the per-dimm
     DCSM register. So, change the interface to accept a 'cs_mask_nr'
     value to facilitate this calculation
 - switch-casing determine_memory_type()
   - done to cleanse the function of too many if-else statements
     and improve readability
   - This is now called early in read_mc_regs() to cache dram_type

Misc cleanup:
 - amd64_pci_table[] is condensed by using PCI_VDEVICE macro.

Testing details:
Tested the patch by injecting 'ECC' type errors using mce_amd_inj
and error decoding works fine.
