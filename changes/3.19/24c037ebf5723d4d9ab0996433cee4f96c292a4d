exit: pidns: alloc_pid() leaks pid_namespace if child_reaper is exiting

alloc_pid() does get_pid_ns() beforehand but forgets to put_pid_ns() if it
fails because disable_pid_allocation() was called by the exiting
child_reaper.

We could simply move get_pid_ns() down to successful return, but this fix
tries to be as trivial as possible.
