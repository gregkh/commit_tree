sunrpc: add a debugfs rpc_xprt directory with an info file in it

Add a new directory heirarchy under the debugfs sunrpc/ directory:

    sunrpc/
        rpc_xprt/
            <xprt id>/

Within that directory, we can put files that give info about the
xprts. We do have the (minor) problem that there is no succinct,
unique identifier for rpc_xprts. So we generate them synthetically
with a static atomic_t counter.

For now, this directory just holds an "info" file, but we may add
other files to it in the future.
