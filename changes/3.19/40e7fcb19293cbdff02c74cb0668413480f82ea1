ACPI: Add _DEP support to fix battery issue on Asus T100TA

ACPI 5.0 introduces _DEP (Operation Region Dependencies) to designate
device objects that OSPM should assign a higher priority in start
ordering due to future operation region accesses.

On Asus T100TA, ACPI battery info are read from a I2C slave device via
I2C operation region. Before I2C operation region handler is installed,
battery _STA always returns 0. There is a _DEP method of designating
start order under battery device node.

This patch is to implement _DEP feature to fix battery issue on the
Asus T100TA.  Introducing acpi_dep_list and adding dep_unmet count
in struct acpi_device. During ACPI namespace scan, create struct
acpi_dep_data for a valid pair of master (device pointed to by _DEP)/
slave(device with _DEP), record master's and slave's ACPI handle in
it and put it into acpi_dep_list. The dep_unmet count will increase
by one if there is a device under its _DEP. Driver's probe() should
return EPROBE_DEFER when find dep_unmet is larger than 0. When I2C
operation region handler is installed, remove all struct acpi_dep_data
on the acpi_dep_list whose master is pointed to I2C host controller
and decrease slave's dep_unmet. When dep_unmet decreases to 0, all
_DEP conditions are met and then do acpi_bus_attach() for the device
in order to resolve battery _STA issue on the Asus T100TA.
