ASoC: ad1980: Cleanup printk usage

Use dev_err()/dev_warn() instead of printk(KERN_ERR/KERN_WARNING. This is
common practice and makes it easy to find out which device generated the
message. While we are at it also align the error messages with the other
AC'97 drivers.

Also remove the info message that is printed when the driver is probed, this
is just noise in bootlog.
