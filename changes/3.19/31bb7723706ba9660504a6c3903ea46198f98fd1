x86, mm: Change cachemode exports to non-gpl

Commit 281d4078bec3 ("x86: Make page cache mode a real type")
introduced the symbols __cachemode2pte_tbl and __pte2cachemode_tbl and
exported them via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.  The exports are part of a
replacement of code which has been EXPORT_SYMBOL before these changes
resulting in build breakage of out-of-tree non-gpl modules.

Change EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL to EXPORT-SYMBOL for these two symbols.
