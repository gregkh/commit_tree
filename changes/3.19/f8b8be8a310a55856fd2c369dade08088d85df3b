ftrace, kprobes: Support IPMODIFY flag to find IP modify conflict

Introduce FTRACE_OPS_FL_IPMODIFY to avoid conflict among
ftrace users who may modify regs->ip to change the execution
path. If two or more users modify the regs->ip on the same
function entry, one of them will be broken. So they must add
IPMODIFY flag and make sure that ftrace_set_filter_ip() succeeds.

Note that ftrace doesn't allow ftrace_ops which has IPMODIFY
flag to have notrace hash, and the ftrace_ops must have a
filter hash (so that the ftrace_ops can hook only specific
entries), because it strongly depends on the address and
must be allowed for only few selected functions.
