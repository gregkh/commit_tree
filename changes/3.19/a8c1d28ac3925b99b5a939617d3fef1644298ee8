s2io: use snprintf() as a safety feature

"sp->desc[i]" has 25 characters.  "dev->name" has 15 characters.  If we
used all 15 characters then the sprintf() would overflow.

I changed the "sprintf(sp->name, "%s Neterion %s"" to snprintf(), as
well, even though it can't overflow just to be consistent.
