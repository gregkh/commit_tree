x86: mm: Use 2GB memory block size on large-memory x86-64 systems

On large-memory x86-64 systems of 64GB or more with memory hot-plug
enabled, use a 2GB memory block size. Eg with 64GB memory, this reduces
the number of directories in /sys/devices/system/memory from 512 to 32,
making it more manageable, and reducing the creation time accordingly.

This caveat is that the memory can't be offlined (for hotplug or
otherwise) with the finer default 128MB granularity, but this is
unimportant due to the high memory densities generally used with such
large-memory systems, where eg a single DIMM is the order of 16GB.
