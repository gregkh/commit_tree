virtio: memory access APIs

virtio 1.0 makes all memory structures LE, so
we need APIs to conditionally do a byteswap on BE
architectures.

To make it easier to check code statically,
add virtio specific types for multi-byte integers
in memory.

Add low level wrappers that do a byteswap conditionally, these will be
useful e.g. for vhost.  Add high level wrappers that
query device endian-ness and act accordingly.
