MIPS: ELF: Add definition for the .MIPS.abiflags section

New toolchains will generate a .MIPS.abiflags section, referenced by a
new PT_MIPS_ABIFLAGS program header. This section will provide
information about the requirements of the ELF, including the ISA level
the code is built for, the ASEs it requires, the size of various
registers and its expectations of the floating point mode. This patch
introduces a definition of the structure of this section and the program
header, for use in a subsequent patch.
