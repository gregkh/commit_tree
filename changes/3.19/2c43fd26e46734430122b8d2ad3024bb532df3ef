dm thin: fix missing out-of-data-space to write mode transition if blocks are released

Discard bios and thin device deletion have the potential to release data
blocks.  If the thin-pool is in out-of-data-space mode, and blocks were
released, transition the thin-pool back to full write mode.

The correct time to do this is just after the thin-pool metadata commit.
It cannot be done before the commit because the space maps will not
allow immediate reuse of the data blocks in case there's a rollback
following power failure.
