genhd: check for int overflow in disk_expand_part_tbl()

We can get here from blkdev_ioctl() -> blkpg_ioctl() -> add_partition()
with a user passed in partno value. If we pass in 0x7fffffff, the
new target in disk_expand_part_tbl() overflows the 'int' and we
access beyond the end of ptbl->part[] and even write to it when we
do the rcu_assign_pointer() to assign the new partition.
