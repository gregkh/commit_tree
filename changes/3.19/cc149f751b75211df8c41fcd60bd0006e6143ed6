IB/mlx5: Changes in memory region creation to support on-demand paging

This patch wraps together several changes needed for on-demand paging support
in the mlx5_ib_populate_pas function, and when registering memory regions.

* Instead of accepting a UMR bit telling the function to enable all
  access flags, the function now accepts the access flags themselves.
* For on-demand paging memory regions, fill the memory tables from the
  correct list, and enable/disable the access flags per-page according
  to whether the page is present.
* A new bit is set to enable writing of access flags when using the
  firmware create_mkey command.
* Disable contig pages when on-demand paging is enabled.

In addition the patch changes the UMR code to use PTR_ALIGN instead of
our own macro.
