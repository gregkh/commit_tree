irqchip: bcm7120-l2: Convert driver to use irq_reg_{readl,writel}

On BE MIPS systems this needs to use the new IRQ_GC_BE_IO gc_flag.  In
all other cases it will use the standard readl/writel accessors.

The initial irq_fwd_mask setup runs before "gc" is initialized, so it
is unchanged for now.  This could potentially be a problem on an ARM
system that boots in LE mode but runs a BE kernel, but currently none
of the supported ARM platforms are ever expected to run BE.
