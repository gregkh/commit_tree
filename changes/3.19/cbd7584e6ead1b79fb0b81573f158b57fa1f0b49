ext4: fix block reservation for bigalloc filesystems

For bigalloc filesystems we have to check whether newly requested inode
block isn't already part of a cluster for which we already have delayed
allocation reservation. This check happens in ext4_ext_map_blocks() and
that function sets EXT4_MAP_FROM_CLUSTER if that's the case. However if
ext4_da_map_blocks() finds in extent cache information about the block,
we don't call into ext4_ext_map_blocks() and thus we always end up
getting new reservation even if the space for cluster is already
reserved. This results in overreservation and premature ENOSPC reports.

Fix the problem by checking for existing cluster reservation already in
ext4_da_map_blocks(). That simplifies the logic and actually allows us
to get rid of the EXT4_MAP_FROM_CLUSTER flag completely.
