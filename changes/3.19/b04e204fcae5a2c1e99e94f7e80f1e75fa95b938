ath10k: remove tsf argument from rx_desc tracing

Fundamentally this was wrong. Tsf is only valid
in last MPDU of a PPDU. This means tsf value was
wrong most of the time during heavy traffic.

Also I don't see much point in exposing a
redundant (and broken) tsf value. Userspace can
already read it from the dumped rx descriptor
buffer.
