mm: memcontrol: pull the NULL check from __mem_cgroup_same_or_subtree()

The NULL in mm_match_cgroup() comes from a possibly exiting mm->owner.  It
makes a lot more sense to check where it's looked up, rather than check
for it in __mem_cgroup_same_or_subtree() where it's unexpected.

No other callsite passes NULL to __mem_cgroup_same_or_subtree().
