esp_scsi: use FIFO for command submission

Using DMA for command submission has the drawback that it might
generate additional DMA completion interrupts after the command
has been submitted to the device.
Additionally the am53c974 has a design flaw causing it
to generate spurious interrupts even though DMA completion
interrupts are not enabled.
This can be avoided by using the FIFO for command submission.
