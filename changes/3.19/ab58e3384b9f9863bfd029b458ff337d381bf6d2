drm/atomic-helper: Skip vblank waits for unchanged fbs

Especially with legacy cursor ioctls existing userspace assumes that
you can pile up lots of updates in one go. The super-proper way to
support this would be a special commit mode which overwrites the last
update. But getting there will be quite a bit of work.

Meanwhile do what pretty much all the drivers have done for the plane
update functions: Simply skip the vblank wait for the buffer cleanup
if the buffer is the same. Since the universal cursor plane code will
not recreate framebuffers needlessly this allows us to not slow down
legacy pageflip events while someone moves the cursor around.

v2: Drop the async plane update hunk from a previous attempt at this
issue.

v3: Fix up kerneldoc.

v4: Don't oops so badly. Reported by Jasper.
