serial: 8250_core: actually limit char reads to max_count

In serial8250_rx_chars(), max_count is set to 256. Due to the
post-decrement operator used in the while() condition, the maximum
number of iterations actually 257. This is not a problem, but it is
mildly surprising if you're debugging. Use pre-decrement instead.
