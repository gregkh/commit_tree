HID: logitech-hidpp: disable io in probe error path

Balance a hid_device_io_start() call with hid_device_io_stop() in the
error path. This avoids processing of HID reports when the probe fails
which possibly leads to invalid memory access in hid_device_probe() as
report_enum->report_id_hash might already be freed via
hid_close_report().

hid_set_drvdata() is called before wtp_allocate, be consistent and clear
drvdata too on the error path of wtp_allocate.
