drm/i915: DocBook integration for frontbuffer tracking

I shouldn't ask everyone to do this and fail myself ...

This extracts all the frontbuffer tracking functions into
intel_frontbuffer.c, adds a DOC overview section and also adds the
missing kerneldoc for i915_gem_track_fb and also pulls it into the
same section for convenience.

v2: Don't forget about the header files.

v3: Oops, might check compilation next time around. To make my life
easier drop the increase_pllclock from set_base_atomic since really,
it doesn't matter if you see your Oops or kgdb with a tiny bit of lag.

v4: Try to better explain how to actually use this, requested by Paulo
on irc.

v5: Explain invalidate/flush a bit clearer.

v6: s/business/busyness/
