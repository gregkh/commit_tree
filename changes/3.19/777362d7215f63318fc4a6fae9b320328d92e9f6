sunvnet: vnet_ack() should check if !start_cons to send a missed trigger

As per comments in vnet_start_xmit, for the edge case
when outgoing vnet_start_xmit() data and an incoming STOPPED
ACK cross each other in flight, we may need to send the missed
START trigger from maybe_tx_wakeup() after checking for a
false value of start_cons
