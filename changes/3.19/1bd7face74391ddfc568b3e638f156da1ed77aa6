ima: allocate field pointers array on demand in template_desc_init_fields()

The allocation of a field pointers array is moved at the end of
template_desc_init_fields() and done only if the value of the 'fields'
and 'num_fields' parameters is not NULL. For just validating a template
format string, retrieved template field pointers are placed in a temporary
array.

Changelog:
 - v3:
   - do not check in this patch if 'fields' and 'num_fields' are NULL
     (suggested by Mimi Zohar)
