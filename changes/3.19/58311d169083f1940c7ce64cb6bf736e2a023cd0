tipc: eliminate two pseudo message types of BUNDLE_OPEN and BUNDLE_CLOSED

The pseudo message types of BUNDLE_CLOSED as well as BUNDLE_OPEN are
used to flag whether or not more messages can be bundled into a data
packet in the outgoing transmission queue. Obviously, no more messages
can be appended after the packet has been sent and is waiting to be
acknowledged and deleted. These message types do in reality represent
a send-side local implementation flag, and are not defined as part of
the protocol. It is therefore safe to move it to to where it belongs,
that is, the control area (TIPC_SKB_CB) of the buffer.
