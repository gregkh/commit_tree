usb: gadget: remove unnecessary 'driver' argument

now that no UDC driver relies on the extra
'driver' argument to ->udc_stop(), we can
safely remove it.

This commit is based on previous work by
Robert Baldyga <r.baldyga@samsung.com> which
can be found at [1]; however that patch turned
out to have a high probability of regressing
many UDC drivers because of a blind search & replace
s/driver/$udc->driver/ which caused the 'driver'
argument to stop_activity() to be a valid non-NULL
pointer when it should be NULL, thus causing UDCs
to mistakenly call gadget driver's ->disconnect()
callback.
