MIPS: Add arch_trigger_all_cpu_backtrace() function

Currently, arch_trigger_all_cpu_backtrace() is defined in only x86 and
sparc which have an NMI.  But in case of softlockup, it could be possible
to dump backtrace of all cpus. and this could be helpful for debugging.

for example, if system has 2 cpus.

	CPU 0				CPU 1
 acquire read_lock()

				try to do write_lock()

 ,,,
 missing read_unlock()

In this case, softlockup will occur becasuse CPU 0 does not call
read_unlock().  And dump_stack() print only backtrace for "CPU 0". If
CPU1's backtrace is printed it's very helpful.
