xen-pciback: drop SR-IOV VFs when PF driver unloads

When a PF driver unloads, it may find it necessary to leave the VFs
around simply because of pciback having marked them as assigned to a
guest. Utilize a suitable notification to let go of the VFs, thus
allowing the PF to go back into the state it was before its driver
loaded (which in particular allows the driver to be loaded again with
it being able to create the VFs anew, but which also allows to then
pass through the PF instead of the VFs).

Don't do this however for any VFs currently in active use by a guest.
