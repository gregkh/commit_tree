blk-mq: Let drivers cancel requeue_work

Kicking requeued requests will start h/w queues in a work_queue, which
may alter the driver's requested state to temporarily stop them. This
patch exports a method to cancel the q->requeue_work so a driver can be
assured stopped h/w queues won't be started up before it is ready.
