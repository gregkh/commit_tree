ARM: at91: board-dt-sama5: add phy_fixup to override NAND_Tree

Appearance: On some SAMA5D4EK boards, after power up, the Eth1 doesn't work.

Reason: The PIOE2 pin is connected to the NAND_Tree# of KSZ8081,
But it outputs LOW during the reset period, which cause the NAND_Tree# enabled.

Add phy_fixup() to disable NAND_Tree by overriding the Operation
Mode Strap Override register(i.e. Register 16h) to clear the NAND_Tree bit.
