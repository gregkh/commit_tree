gue: Add infrastructure for flags and options

Add functions and basic definitions for processing standard flags,
private flags, and control messages. This includes definitions
to compute length of optional fields corresponding to a set of flags.
Flag validation is in validate_gue_flags function. This checks for
unknown flags, and that length of optional fields is <= length
in guehdr hlen.
