staging: comedi: addi_apci_1564: fix dev->iobase for all PLD revisions

The APCI-1564 has different I/O mapping depending on if the PLD revision is
Rev 1.0 or Rev 2.x.

Fix the main register defines so they will work for all PLD revisions and
initialie the dev->iobase appropriately. Move the register defines to the
main driver source file.
