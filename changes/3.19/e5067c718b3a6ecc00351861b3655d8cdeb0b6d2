MIPS: pci-rt3883: Remove odd locking in PCI config space access code

Caller (generic PCI code) already do proper locking so no need to add
another one here. Local PCI read/write functions are never called
simultaneously, also they do not require synchronization with the PCI
controller ops, since they are used before the controller registration.
