i40e: properly parse MDET registers

Fix a few problems with our parsing of the MDET registers:
* Queue IDs are longer than 8 bits
* Queue IDs are absolute for the device and the base queue must be
  subtracted out.
* VF IDs are longer than 8 bits
* Use the MASK define to mask the event value, instead of the SHIFT
  define.
