ALSA: oxfw: Change the way to start stream

In past commit, this driver can keep stream formations for each sampling
rate. So its stream functionality can decide stream formations with given
some parameters.

This commit moves related codes from PCM functionality to stream
functionality. Furthermore, to set stream format correctly, this commit
uses AV/C Stream Format Information command instead of AV/C Input/Output
Plug Signal Format command.
