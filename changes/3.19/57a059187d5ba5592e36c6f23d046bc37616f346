exit: reparent: cleanup the changing of ->parent

1. Cosmetic, but "if (t->parent == father)" looks a bit confusing.
   We need to change t->parent if and only if t is not traced.

2. If we actually want this BUG_ON() to ensure that parent/ptrace
   match each other, then we should also take ptrace_reparented()
   case into account too.

3. Change this code to use for_each_thread() instead of deprecated
   while_each_thread().
