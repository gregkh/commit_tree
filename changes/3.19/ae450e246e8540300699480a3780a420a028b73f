target: Allow AllRegistrants to re-RESERVE existing reservation

This patch changes core_scsi3_pro_release() logic to allow an
existing AllRegistrants type reservation to be re-reserved by
any registered I_T nexus.

This addresses a issue where AllRegistrants type RESERVE was
receiving RESERVATION_CONFLICT status if dev_pr_res_holder did
not match the same I_T nexus, instead of just returning GOOD
status following spc4r34 Section 5.9.9:

"If the device server receives a PERSISTENT RESERVE OUT command
 with RESERVE service action where the TYPE field and the SCOPE
 field contain the same values as the existing type and scope
 from a persistent reservation holder, it shall not make any
 change to the existing persistent reservation and shall complete
 the command with GOOD status."
