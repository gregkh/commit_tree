x86/vdso: Make the PER_CPU segment 32 bits

IMO users ought not to be able to use 16-bit segments without
using modify_ldt.  Fortunately, it's impossible to break
espfix64 by loading the PER_CPU segment into SS because it's
PER_CPU is marked read-only and SS cannot contain an RO segment,
but marking PER_CPU as 32-bit is less fragile.
