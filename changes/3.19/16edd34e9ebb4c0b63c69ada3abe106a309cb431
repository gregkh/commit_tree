amd-xgbe: Tx engine must not be active before stopping it

If the Tx engine is told to stop while it is actively processing Tx
descriptors it is possible that the Tx descriptor(s) will not be closed
out properly. When the Tx engine is restarted this could result in the
driver being stuck on the improperly closed descriptor.

Update the driver to wait for the Tx engine to be in a stopped or
suspended state before issuing the stop command.

This has not been an issue to date, but it's a good safe-guard to have.
