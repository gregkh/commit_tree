net: avoid two atomic operations in fast clones

Commit ce1a4ea3f125 ("net: avoid one atomic operation in skb_clone()")
took the wrong way to save one atomic operation.

It is actually possible to avoid two atomic operations, if we
do not change skb->fclone values, and only rely on clone_ref
content to signal if the clone is available or not.

skb_clone() can simply use the fast clone if clone_ref is 1.

kfree_skbmem() can avoid the atomic_dec_and_test() if clone_ref is 1.

Note that because we usually free the clone before the original skb,
this particular attempt is only done for the original skb to have better
branch prediction.

SKB_FCLONE_FREE is removed.
