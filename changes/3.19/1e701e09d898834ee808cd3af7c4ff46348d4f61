i40e: enable LSE poke and simplify link state

The driver can do a simpler job of managing link state by simply
using the admin queue receive event for link events as a doorbell
that tells the driver to update link state.

Additionally, add a workaround will help make sure the link state in the
hardware is consistent with the link state the driver is reporting
by refreshing the link state every service task interval.
