ath5k: revert AHB bus support removing

This reverts commit 093ec3c5337434f40d77c1af06c139da3e5ba6dc.

AHB bus code has been removed, since we did not have support Atheros
AR231x SoC, required for building the AHB version of ath5k. Now that
support WiSoC chips added we can restore functionality back.
