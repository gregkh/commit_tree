mm: replace ACCESS_ONCE with READ_ONCE or barriers

ACCESS_ONCE does not work reliably on non-scalar types. For
example gcc 4.6 and 4.7 might remove the volatile tag for such
accesses during the SRA (scalar replacement of aggregates) step
(https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58145)

Let's change the code to access the page table elements with
READ_ONCE that does implicit scalar accesses for the gup code.

mm_find_pmd is tricky, because m68k and sparc(32bit) define pmd_t
as array of longs. This code requires just that the pmd_present
and pmd_trans_huge check are done on the same value, so a barrier
is sufficent.

A similar case is in handle_pte_fault. On ppc44x the word size is
32 bit, but a pte is 64 bit. A barrier is ok as well.
