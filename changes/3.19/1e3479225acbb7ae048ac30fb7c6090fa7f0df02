ARM: 8275/1: mm: fix PMD_SECT_RDONLY undeclared compile error

In v3.19-rc3 tree when CONFIG_ARM_LPAE and CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA are enabled
image failed to compile with the following error:

arch/arm/mm/init.c:661:14: error: ‘PMD_SECT_RDONLY’ undeclared here (not in a function)

It seems that '80d6b0c ARM: mm: allow text and rodata sections to be read-only'
and 'ded9477 ARM: 8109/1: mm: Modify pte_write and pmd_write logic for LPAE'
commits crossed. 80d6b0c uses PMD_SECT_RDONLY macro but ded9477 renames it
and uses software bits L_PMD_SECT_RDONLY instead.

Fix is to use L_PMD_SECT_RDONLY instead PMD_SECT_RDONLY as ded9477 does in
another places.
