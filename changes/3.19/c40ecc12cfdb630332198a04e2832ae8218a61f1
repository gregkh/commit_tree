scsi: avoid ->change_queue_depth indirection for queue full tracking

All drivers use the implementation for ramping the queue up and down, so
instead of overloading the change_queue_depth method call the
implementation diretly if the driver opts into it by setting the
track_queue_depth flag in the host template.

Note that a few drivers validated the new queue depth in their
change_queue_depth method, but as we never go over the queue depth
set during slave_configure or the sysfs file this isn't nessecary
and can safely be removed.
