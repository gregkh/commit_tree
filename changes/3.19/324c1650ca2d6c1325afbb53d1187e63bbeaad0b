tty: Simplify pty pair teardown logic

When the slave side closes and its tty count is 0, the pty
pair can be destroyed; the master side must have already
closed for the slave side tty count to be 0. Thus, only the
pty master close must check if the slave side has closed by
checking the slave tty count.

Remove the pre-computed closing flags and check the actual count(s).
Regular ttys are unaffected by this change.
