drm/i915: Don't continually defer the hangcheck

With multiple rings, we may continue to render on the blitter whilst
executing an infinite shader on the render ring. As we currently, rearm
the timer with each execbuf, in this scenario the hangcheck will never
fire and we will never detect the lockup on the render ring. Instead,
only arm the timer once per hangcheck, so that hangcheck runs more
frequently.

v2: Rearrange code to avoid triggering a BUG_ON in add_timer from
softirq context.
