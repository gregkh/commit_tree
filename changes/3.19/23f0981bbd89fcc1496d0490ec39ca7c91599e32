perf callchain: Enable printing the srcline in the history

For lbr-as-callgraph we need to see the line number in the history,
because many LBR entries can be in a single function, and just
showing the same function name many times is not useful.

When the history code is configured to sort by address, also try to
resolve the address to a file:srcline and display this in the browser.
If that doesn't work still display the address.

This can be also useful without LBRs for understanding which call in a large
function (or in which inlined function) called something else.

Contains fixes from Namhyung Kim

v2: Refactor code into common function
v3: Fix GTK build
