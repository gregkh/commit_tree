thermal: cpu_cooling: Use cpufreq_dev->freq_table for finding level/freq

get_property() was an over complicated beast with BUGs. It used to believe that
cpufreq table is present in ascending or descending order, which might not
always be true.

Previous patch has created another freq table in descending order for us and we
better use it now. With that get_property() simply goes away and another helper
get_level() comes in.
