[media] vb2: fix vb2_thread_stop race conditions

The locking scheme inside the vb2 thread is unsafe when stopping the
thread. In particular kthread_stop was called *after* internal data
structures were cleaned up instead of doing that before. In addition,
internal vb2 functions were called after threadio->stop was set to
true and vb2_internal_streamoff was called. This is also not allowed.

All this led to a variety of race conditions and kernel warnings and/or
oopses.

Fixed by moving the kthread_stop call up before the cleanup takes
place, and by checking threadio->stop before calling internal vb2
queuing operations.
