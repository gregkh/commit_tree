evm: skip replacing EVM signature with HMAC on read-only filesystem

If filesystem is mounted read-only or file is immutable, updating
xattr will fail. This is a usual case during early boot until
filesystem is remount read-write. This patch verifies conditions
to skip unnecessary attempt to calculate HMAC and set xattr.

Changes in v2:
* indention changed according to Lindent (requested by Mimi)
