PM / OPP: replace kfree with kfree_rcu while freeing 'struct device_opp'

Somehow one of the instance of freeing resources failed to use kfree_rcu() and
used kfree() instead. This might cause problems as the node might be referenced
by readers under rcu locks and we must wait for the rcu grace period as well.

While we are at it, also update comment over 'struct device_opp' to mention why
we are waiting for both rcu and srcu grace periods.
