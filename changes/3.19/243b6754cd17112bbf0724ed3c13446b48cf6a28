efi/x86: Move x86 back to libstub

This reverts commit 84be880560fb, which itself reverted my original
attempt to move x86 from #include'ing .c files from across the tree
to using the EFI stub built as a static library.

The issue that affected the original approach was that splitting
the implementation into several .o files resulted in the variable
'efi_early' becoming a global with external linkage, which under
-fPIC implies that references to it must go through the GOT. However,
dealing with this additional GOT entry turned out to be troublesome
on some EFI implementations. (GCC's visibility=hidden attribute is
supposed to lift this requirement, but it turned out not to work on
the 32-bit build.)

Instead, use a pure getter function to get a reference to efi_early.
This approach results in no additional GOT entries being generated,
so there is no need for any changes in the early GOT handling.
