x86/build: Clean auto-generated processor feature files

Commit 9def39be4e96 ("x86: Support compiling out human-friendly
processor feature names") made two source file targets
conditional. Such conditional targets will not be cleaned
automatically by make mrproper.

Fix by adding explicit clean-files targets for the two files.
