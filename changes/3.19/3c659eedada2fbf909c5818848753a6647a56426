perf tools: Add id index

Add an index of the event identifiers, in preparation for Intel PT.

The event id (also called the sample id) is a unique number
allocated by the kernel to the event created by perf_event_open().  Events
can include the event id by having a sample type including PERF_SAMPLE_ID or
PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER.

Currently the main use of the event id is to match an event back to the
evsel to which it belongs i.e. perf_evlist__id2evsel()

The purpose of this patch is to make it possible to match an event back to
the mmap from which it was read.  The reason that is useful is because the
mmap represents a time-ordered context (either for a cpu or for a thread).
Intel PT decodes trace information on that basis.  In full-trace mode, that
information can be recorded when the Intel PT trace is read, but in
sample-mode the Intel PT trace data is embedded in a sample and it is in
that case that the "id index" is needed.

So the mmaps are numbered (idx) and the cpu and tid recorded against the id
by perf_evlist__set_sid_idx() which is called by perf_evlist__mmap_per_evsel().

That information is recorded on the perf.data file in the new "id index".
idx, cpu and tid are added to struct perf_sample_id (which is the node of
evlist's hash table to match ids to evsels).  The information can be
retrieved using perf_evlist__id2sid().  Note however this all depends on
having a sample type including PERF_SAMPLE_ID or PERF_SAMPLE_IDENTIFIER,
otherwise ids are not recorded.

The "id index" is a synthesized event record which will be created when
Intel PT sampling is used by calling perf_event__synthesize_id_index().
