can: slcan/vcan: eliminate banner[] variable, switch to pr_info()

Several can modules in drivers/net/can use a banner[] variable at the
top which defines a string that is used once during init.  This string
is also embedded with KERN_INFO which makes it printk() specific.

Improve the code by eliminating the banner[] variable and moving the
string to where it is printed.  Then switch from printk(KERN_INFO to
pr_info() for the lines that were changed.

This patch is similar to [1] which was applied to net/can.
