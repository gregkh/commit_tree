fs/proc: use a rb tree for the directory entries

When a lot of netdevices are created, one of the bottleneck is the
creation of proc entries.  This serie aims to accelerate this part.

The current implementation for the directories in /proc is using a single
linked list.  This is slow when handling directories with large numbers of
entries (eg netdevice-related entries when lots of tunnels are opened).

This patch replaces this linked list by a red-black tree.

Here are some numbers:

dummy30000.batch contains 30 000 times 'link add type dummy'.

Before the patch:
  $ time ip -b dummy30000.batch
  real    2m31.950s
  user    0m0.440s
  sys     2m21.440s
  $ time rmmod dummy
  real    1m35.764s
  user    0m0.000s
  sys     1m24.088s

After the patch:
  $ time ip -b dummy30000.batch
  real    2m0.874s
  user    0m0.448s
  sys     1m49.720s
  $ time rmmod dummy
  real    1m13.988s
  user    0m0.000s
  sys     1m1.008s

The idea of improving this part was suggested by Thierry Herbelot.
