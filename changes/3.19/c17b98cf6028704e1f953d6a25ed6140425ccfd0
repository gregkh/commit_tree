KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Remove code for PPC970 processors

This removes the code that was added to enable HV KVM to work
on PPC970 processors.  The PPC970 is an old CPU that doesn't
support virtualizing guest memory.  Removing PPC970 support also
lets us remove the code for allocating and managing contiguous
real-mode areas, the code for the !kvm->arch.using_mmu_notifiers
case, the code for pinning pages of guest memory when first
accessed and keeping track of which pages have been pinned, and
the code for handling H_ENTER hypercalls in virtual mode.

Book3S HV KVM is now supported only on POWER7 and POWER8 processors.
The KVM_CAP_PPC_RMA capability now always returns 0.
