ARM: dts: Specify default clocks for Exynos4 camera devices

Specify the default mux and divider clocks in device tree
to ensure the FIMC devices on Trats, Trats2, Universal_c210
and Odroid X2/U3 boards are clocked from recommended clock
source and with maximum supported frequency.
For Trats2 also the MIPI-CSIS and the camera sensor clocks
are configured, the 'clock-frequency' property is deprecated
in favour of 'assigned-clock-rates' property.
