cxgb4: Cleanup macros so they follow the same style and look consistent

Various patches have ended up changing the style of the symbolic macros/register
to different style.

As a result, the current kernel.org files are a mix of different macro styles.
Since this macro/register defines is used by different drivers a
few patch series have ended up adding duplicate macro/register define entries
with different styles. This makes these register define/macro files a complete
mess and we want to make them clean and consistent. This patch cleans up a part
of it.
