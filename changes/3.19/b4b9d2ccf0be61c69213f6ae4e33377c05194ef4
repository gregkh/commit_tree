sunrpc: add debugfs file for displaying client rpc_task queue

It's possible to get a dump of the RPC task queue by writing a value to
/proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug. If you write any value to that file, you get
a dump of the RPC client task list into the log buffer. This is a rather
inconvenient interface however, and makes it hard to get immediate info
about the task queue.

Add a new directory hierarchy under debugfs:

    sunrpc/
        rpc_clnt/
            <clientid>/

Within each clientid directory we create a new "tasks" file that will
dump info similar to what shows up in the log buffer, but with a few
small differences -- we avoid printing raw kernel addresses in favor of
symbolic names and the XID is also displayed.
