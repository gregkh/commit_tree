sound: sst-haswell-pcm: Replace CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME with CONFIG_PM

The sst-haswell-pcm driver is a new user of CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME.

However, after commit b2b49ccbdd54 (PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if
PM_SLEEP is selected) PM_RUNTIME is always set if PM is set, so
#ifdef blocks depending on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME may now be changed to
depend on CONFIG_PM.

Replace CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME with CONFIG_PM in
sound/soc/intel/sst-haswell-pcm.c.
