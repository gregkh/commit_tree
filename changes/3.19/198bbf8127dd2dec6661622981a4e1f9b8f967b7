rcu: Remove "cpu" argument to rcu_prepare_for_idle()

The "cpu" argument to rcu_prepare_for_idle() is always the current
CPU, so drop it.  This in turn allows two of the uses of "cpu" in
this function to be replaced with a this_cpu_ptr() and the third by
smp_processor_id(), replacing that of the call to rcu_prepare_for_idle().
Again, the anticipated cross-CPU uses of these functions has been replaced
by NO_HZ_FULL.
