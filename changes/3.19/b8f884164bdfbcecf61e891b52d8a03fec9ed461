[media] cx88: increase API command timeout

The timeout is way too small. Especially complicated command like
CX2341X_ENC_STOP_CAPTURE takes much more time than 10 ms. Increase the
timeout to 1 second, just as ivtv does (the cx88-blackbird has the
same IP core for MPEG compression as ivtv).

This solves a nasty issue where STOP_CAPTURE would timeout and the
mailbox is left in a busy state, making it impossible to start streaming
a second time without reloading the driver first.
