Btrfs: fix freeing used extent after removing empty block group

Due to ignoring errors returned by clear_extent_bits (at the moment only
-ENOMEM is possible), we can end up freeing an extent that is actually in
use (i.e. return the extent to the free space cache).

The sequence of steps that lead to this:

1) Cleaner thread starts execution and calls btrfs_delete_unused_bgs(), with
   the goal of freeing empty block groups;

2) btrfs_delete_unused_bgs() finds an empty block group, joins the current
   transaction (or starts a new one if none is running) and attempts to
   clear the EXTENT_DIRTY bit for the block group's range from freed_extents[0]
   and freed_extents[1] (of which one corresponds to fs_info->pinned_extents);

3) Clearing the EXTENT_DIRTY bit (via clear_extent_bits()) fails with
   -ENOMEM, but such error is ignored and btrfs_delete_unused_bgs() proceeds
   to delete the block group and the respective chunk, while pinned_extents
   remains with that bit set for the whole (or a part of the) range covered
   by the block group;

4) Later while the transaction is still running, the chunk ends up being reused
   for a new block group (maybe for different purpose, data or metadata), and
   extents belonging to the new block group are allocated for file data or btree
   nodes/leafs;

5) The current transaction is committed, meaning that we unpinned one or more
   extents from the new block group (through btrfs_finish_extent_commit() and
   unpin_extent_range()) which are now being used for new file data or new
   metadata (through btrfs_finish_extent_commit() and unpin_extent_range()).
   And unpinning means we returned the extents to the free space cache of the
   new block group, which implies those extents can be used for future allocations
   while they're still in use.

Alternatively, we can hit a BUG_ON() when doing a lookup for a block group's cache
object in unpin_extent_range() if a new block group didn't end up being allocated for
the same chunk (step 4 above).

Fix this by not freeing the block group and chunk if we fail to clear the dirty bit.
