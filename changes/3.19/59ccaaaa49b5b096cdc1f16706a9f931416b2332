bridge: dont send notification when skb->len == 0 in rtnl_bridge_notify

Reported in: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=92081

This patch avoids calling rtnl_notify if the device ndo_bridge_getlink
handler does not return any bytes in the skb.

Alternately, the skb->len check can be moved inside rtnl_notify.

For the bridge vlan case described in 92081, there is also a fix needed
in bridge driver to generate a proper notification. Will fix that in
subsequent patch.

v2: rebase patch on net tree
