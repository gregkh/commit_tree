irqchip: mips-gic: Stop using per-platform mapping tables

Now that the GIC properly uses IRQ domains, kill off the per-platform
routing tables that were used to make the GIC appear transparent.

This includes:
 - removing the mapping tables and the support for applying them,
 - moving GIC IPI support to the GIC driver,
 - properly routing the i8259 through the GIC on Malta, and
 - updating IRQ assignments on SEAD-3 when the GIC is present.

Platforms no longer will pass an interrupt mapping table to gic_init.
Instead, they will pass the CPU interrupt vector (2 - 7) that they
expect the GIC to route interrupts to.  Note that in EIC mode this
value is ignored and all GIC interrupts are routed to EIC vector 1.
