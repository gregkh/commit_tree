hugetlb: fix hugepages= entry in kernel-parameters.txt

The hugepages= entry in kernel-parameters.txt states that 1GB pages can
only be allocated at boot time and not freed afterwards.  This is not
true since commit 944d9fec8d7a ("hugetlb: add support for gigantic page
allocation at runtime"), at least for x86_64.

Instead of adding arch-specifc observations to the hugepages= entry,
this commit just drops the out of date information.  Further information
about arch-specific support and available features can be obtained in
the hugetlb documentation.
