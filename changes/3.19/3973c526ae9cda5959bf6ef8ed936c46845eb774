can: c_can: Disable pins when CAN interface is down

DRA7 CAN IP suffers from a problem which causes it to be prevented
from fully turning OFF (i.e. stuck in transition) if the module was
disabled while there was traffic on the CAN_RX line.

To work around this issue we select the SLEEP pin state by default
on probe and use the DEFAULT pin state on CAN up and back to the
SLEEP pin state on CAN down.
