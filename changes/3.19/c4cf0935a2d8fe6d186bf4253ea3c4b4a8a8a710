bus: omap_l3_noc: Correct returning IRQ_HANDLED unconditionally in the irq handler

Correct returning IRQ_HANDLED unconditionally in the irq handler.
Return IRQ_NONE for some interrupt which we do not expect to be
handled in this handler. This prevents kernel stalling with back
to back spurious interrupts.
