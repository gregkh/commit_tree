ASoC: samsung: add support for exynos7 I2S controller

Exynos7 I2S controller has no internal dma, supports more
no. of root clock sampling frequencies and has more no.of Rx
fifos to support 7.1CH recording in TDM mode. Due to more no.
of root clock frequency values some of the bit offsets got
shifted up by one. Also I2S1 on previous Samsung platforms
uses v3 dai type but on Exynos7 it is upgraded to v5 with
slightly modified register offsets for supporting more no.of
RFS values. Due to the above changes, the driver has to be
modified to handle all versions of I2S controller. For this
I introduced a new structure to hold modified bit offsets and
masks which is passed as dai data.
