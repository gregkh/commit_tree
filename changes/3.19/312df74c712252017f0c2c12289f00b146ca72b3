net/mlx4_en: mlx4_en_set_settings() always fails when autoneg is set

Fix ethtool set settings to not check AUTONEG_ENABLE

mlx4_en_set_settings should not check if cmd->autoneg == AUTONEG_ENABLE,
cmd->autoneg can be enabled by default and this check will fail other settings requests.
mlx4_en driver doesn't support changing autoneg value, but shouldn't fail the request
in case cmd->autoneg was set.
