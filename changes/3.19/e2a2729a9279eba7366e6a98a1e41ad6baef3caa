amd-xgbe: Use proper Rx flow control register

Updated hardware documention shows the Rx flow control settings were
moved from the Rx queue operation mode register to a new Rx queue flow
control register.  The old flow control settings are now reserved areas
of the Rx queue operation mode register. Update the code to use the new
register.
