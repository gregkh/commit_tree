cxl: Add timeout to process element commands

In the event that something goes wrong in the hardware and it is unable
to complete a process element comment we would end up polling forever,
effectively making the associated process unkillable.

This patch adds a timeout to the process element command code path, so
that we will give up if the hardware does not respond in a reasonable
time.
