scsi: add SG_SCSI_RESET_NO_ESCALATE flag to SG_SCSI_RESET ioctl

Further to a January 2013 thread titled: "[PATCH] SG_SCSI_RESET ioctl
should only perform requested operation" by Jeremy Linton a patch (v3)
is presented that expands the existing ioctl to include "no_escalate"
versions to the existing resets. This requires no changes to SCSI low
level drivers (LLDs); it adds several more finely tuned reset options
to the user space. For example:

   /* This call remains the same, with the same escalating semantics
    * if the device (LU) reset fail. That is: on failure to try a
    * target reset and if that fails, try a bus reset, and if that fails
    * try a host (i.e. LLD) reset. */
   val = SG_SCSI_RESET_DEVICE;
   res = ioctl(<sg_or_block_fd>, SG_SCSI_RESET, &val);

   /* What follows is a new option introduced by this patch series. Only
    * a device reset is attempted. If that fails then an appropriate
    * error code is provided. N.B. There is no reset escalation. */
   val = SG_SCSI_RESET_DEVICE | SG_SCSI_RESET_NO_ESCALATE;
   res = ioctl(<sg_or_block_fd>, SG_SCSI_RESET, &val);
