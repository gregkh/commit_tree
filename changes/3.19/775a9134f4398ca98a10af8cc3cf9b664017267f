mtd: nand: omap: Fix NAND enumeration on 3430 LDP

3430LDP has NAND flash with 32 bytes OOB size which is sufficient to hold
BCH8 codes but the small page check introduced in
commit b491da7233d5 ("mtd: nand: omap: clean-up ecc layout for BCH ecc schemes")
considers anything below 64 bytes unsuitable for BCH4/8/16. There is another
bug in that code where it doesn't skip the check for OMAP_ECC_HAM1_CODE_SW.

Get rid of that small page check code as it is insufficient and redundant
because we are checking for OOB available bytes vs ecc layout before calling
nand_scan_tail().

Fixes: b491da7233d5 ("mtd: nand: omap: clean-up ecc layout for BCH ecc schemes")
