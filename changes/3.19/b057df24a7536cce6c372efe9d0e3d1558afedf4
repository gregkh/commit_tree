cls_api.c: Fix dumping of non-existing actions' stats.

In tcf_exts_dump_stats(), ensure that exts->actions is not empty before
accessing the first element of that list and calling tcf_action_copy_stats()
on it.  This fixes some random segvs when adding filters of type "basic" with
no particular action.

This also fixes the dumping of those "no-action" filters, which more often
than not made calls to tcf_action_copy_stats() fail and consequently netlink
attributes added by the caller to be removed by a call to nla_nest_cancel().
