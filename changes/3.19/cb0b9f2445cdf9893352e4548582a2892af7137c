sched/fair: Fix stale overloaded status in the busiest group finding logic

Commit caeb178c60f4 ("sched/fair: Make update_sd_pick_busiest() return
'true' on a busier sd") changes groups to be ranked in the order of
overloaded > imbalance > other, and busiest group is picked according
to this order.

sgs->group_capacity_factor is used to check if the group is overloaded.

When the child domain prefers tasks to go to siblings first, the
sgs->group_capacity_factor will be set lower than one in order to
move all the excess tasks away.

However, group overloaded status is not updated when
sgs->group_capacity_factor is set to lower than one, which leads to us
missing to find the busiest group.

This patch fixes it by updating group overloaded status when sg capacity
factor is set to one, in order to find the busiest group accurately.
