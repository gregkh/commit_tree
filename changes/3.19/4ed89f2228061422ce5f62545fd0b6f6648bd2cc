ARM: convert printk(KERN_* to pr_*

Convert many (but not all) printk(KERN_* to pr_* to simplify the code.
We take the opportunity to join some printk lines together so we don't
split the message across several lines, and we also add a few levels
to some messages which were previously missing them.
