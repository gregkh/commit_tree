fuse: fix LOOKUP vs INIT compat handling

Analysis from Marc:

 "Commit 7078187a795f ("fuse: introduce fuse_simple_request() helper")
  from the above pull request triggers some EIO errors for me in some tests
  that rely on fuse

  Looking at the code changes and a bit of debugging info I think there's a
  general problem here that fuse_get_req checks and possibly waits for
  fc->initialized, and this was always called first.  But this commit
  changes the ordering and in many places fc->minor is now possibly used
  before fuse_get_req, and we can't be sure that fc has been initialized.
  In my case fuse_lookup_init sets req->out.args[0].size to the wrong size
  because fc->minor at that point is still 0, leading to the EIO error."

Fix by moving the compat adjustments into fuse_simple_request() to after
fuse_get_req().

This is also more readable than the original, since now compatibility is
handled in a single function instead of cluttering each operation.
