brcmsmac: fix statistic counter update function

The 802.11 core statistics are retrieved from the core registers
but not stored. So the debug code was never triggered to give a
warning message on tx underruns or rx overflows. This patch fixes
this and assures the statistics are stored in the snapshot.
