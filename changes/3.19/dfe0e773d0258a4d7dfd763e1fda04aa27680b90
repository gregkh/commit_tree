mm: memcontrol: update mem_cgroup_page_lruvec() documentation

Commit 7512102cf64d ("memcg: fix GPF when cgroup removal races with last
exit") added a pc->mem_cgroup reset into mem_cgroup_page_lruvec() to
prevent a crash where an anon page gets uncharged on unmap, the memcg is
released, and then the final LRU isolation on free dereferences the
stale pc->mem_cgroup pointer.

But since commit 0a31bc97c80c ("mm: memcontrol: rewrite uncharge API"),
pages are only uncharged AFTER that final LRU isolation, which
guarantees the memcg's lifetime until then.  pc->mem_cgroup now only
needs to be reset for swapcache readahead pages.

Update the comment and callsite requirements accordingly.
