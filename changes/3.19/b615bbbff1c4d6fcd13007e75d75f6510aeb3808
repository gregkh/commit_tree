arm: use generic fixmap.h

ARM is different from other architectures in that fixmap pages are indexed
with a positive offset from FIXADDR_START.  Other architectures index with
a negative offset from FIXADDR_TOP.  In order to use the generic fixmap.h
definitions, this patch redefines FIXADDR_TOP to be inclusive of the
useable range.  That is, FIXADDR_TOP is the virtual address of the topmost
fixed page.  The newly defined FIXADDR_END is the first virtual address
past the fixed mappings.
