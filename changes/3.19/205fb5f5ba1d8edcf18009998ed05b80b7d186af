blk-mq: add blk_mq_unique_tag()

The queuecommand() callback functions in SCSI low-level drivers
need to know which hardware context has been selected by the
block layer. Since this information is not available in the
request structure, and since passing the hctx pointer directly to
the queuecommand callback function would require modification of
all SCSI LLDs, add a function to the block layer that allows to
query the hardware context index.
