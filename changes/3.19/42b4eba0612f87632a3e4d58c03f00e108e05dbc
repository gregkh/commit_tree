serial: mxs-auart: clean get_mctrl and set_mctrl

Russell King:
The only thing which the .get_mctrl method is supposed to do is
to return the state of the /input/ lines, which are CTS, DCD, DSR, RI.
The output line state is stored in port->mctrl, and is added to
the returned value by serial_core when it's required.
RTS output state should not be returned from the .get_mctrl method.

This patch removes ctrl variable from mxs_auart_port
and removes useless reading back RTS line.

The ctrl variable in mxs_auart_port duplicated mctrl,
member of uart_port structure in serial_core.h.
The removed code from mxs_auart_set_mctrl() and mxs_auart_get_mctrl
duplicated uart_update_mctrl() and uart_tiocmget()
in serial_core.c.
