MIPS: Kconfig option to better exercise/debug hybrid FPRs

The hybrid FPR scheme exists to allow for compatibility between existing
FP32 code and newly compiled FP64A code. Such code should hopefully be
rare in the real world, and for the moment is difficult to come across.
All code except that built for the FP64 ABI can correctly execute using
the hybrid FPR scheme, so debugging the hybrid FPR implementation can
be eased by forcing all such code to use it. This is undesirable in
general due to the trap & emulate overhead of the hybrid FPR
implementation, but is a very useful option to have for debugging.
