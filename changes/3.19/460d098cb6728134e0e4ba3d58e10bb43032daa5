usb: dwc3: make HIRD threshold configurable

HIRD threshold should be configurable by different platforms.

From DesignWare databook:
When HIRD_Threshold[4] is set to 1b1 and HIRD value is greater than or
equal to the value in HIRD_Threshold[3:0], dwc3 asserts output signals
utmi_l1_suspend_n to put PHY into Deep Low-Power mode in L1.

When HIRD_Threshold[4] is set to 1b0 or the HIRD value is less than
HIRD_Threshold[3:0], dwc3 asserts output signals utmi_sleep_n on L1.
