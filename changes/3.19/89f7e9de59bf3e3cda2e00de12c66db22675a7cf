clk: Really fix deadlock with mmap_sem

Commit 6314b6796e3c (clk: Don't hold prepare_lock across debugfs
creation, 2014-09-04) forgot to update one place where we hold
the prepare_lock while creating debugfs directories. This means
we still have the chance of a deadlock that the commit was trying
to fix. Actually fix it by moving the debugfs creation outside
the prepare_lock.
