ASoC: Intel: Fix the driver data not set issue

The priv_data is allocated again here wrongly, and it
is not set to the driver data after assignment. This
make the pdata->dev is NULL and oops occurs on the first
call to hsw_volume_put.

The resource has been allocated in driver probe callback
hsw_pcm_dev_probe, so here just remove this sencond
allocation is OK.
