drm/i915: Tighting frontbuffer tracking around flips

So I think I've spotted a small gap in the frontbuffer tracking
while discussing the logic with Paulo on irc:

1. Userspace schedules gpu rendering to the current frontbuffer.
This gets tracked in dev_priv->fb_tracking.busy_bits.

2. We pageflip a fully rendered buffer before the frontbuffer
rendering completes.

3. The request retiring will never clear busy_bits (since at retire
time the old frontbuffer won't have obj->frontbuffer_bits set), so
these bits now are stuck until someone again does a bit of frontbuffer
tracking.

If we clear stale busy_bits in flip_prepare this gap is closed.
