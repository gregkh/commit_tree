arm/arm64: KVM: Clarify KVM_ARM_VCPU_INIT ABI

It is not clear that this ioctl can be called multiple times for a given
vcpu.  Userspace already does this, so clarify the ABI.

Also specify that userspace is expected to always make secondary and
subsequent calls to the ioctl with the same parameters for the VCPU as
the initial call (which userspace also already does).

Add code to check that userspace doesn't violate that ABI in the future,
and move the kvm_vcpu_set_target() function which is currently
duplicated between the 32-bit and 64-bit versions in guest.c to a common
static function in arm.c, shared between both architectures.
