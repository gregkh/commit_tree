neigh: optimize neigh_parms_release()

In neigh_parms_release() we loop over all entries to find the entry given in
argument and being able to remove it from the list. By using a double linked
list, we can avoid this loop.

Here are some numbers with 30 000 dummy interfaces configured:

Before the patch:
$ time rmmod dummy
real	2m0.118s
user	0m0.000s
sys	1m50.048s

After the patch:
$ time rmmod dummy
real	1m9.970s
user	0m0.000s
sys	0m47.976s
