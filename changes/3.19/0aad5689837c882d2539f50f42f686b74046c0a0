xen: Hide get_phys_to_machine() to be able to tune common path

Today get_phys_to_machine() is always called when the mfn for a pfn
is to be obtained. Add a wrapper __pfn_to_mfn() as inline function
to be able to avoid calling get_phys_to_machine() when possible as
soon as the switch to a linear mapped p2m list has been done.
