video: fbdev-MMP: Deletion of an unnecessary check before the function call "mmp_unregister_path"

The mmp_unregister_path() function tests whether its argument is NULL
and then returns immediately. Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
