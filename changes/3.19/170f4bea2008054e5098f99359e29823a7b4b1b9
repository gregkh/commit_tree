tools: hv: introduce -n/--no-daemon option

All tools/hv daemons do mandatory daemon() on startup. However, no pidfile
is created, this make it difficult for an init system to track such daemons.
Modern linux distros use systemd as their init system. It can handle the
daemonizing by itself, however, it requires a daemon to stay in foreground
for that. Some distros already carry distro-specific patch for hv tools
which switches off daemon().

Introduce -n/--no-daemon option for all 3 daemons in hv/tools. Parse options
with getopt() to make this part easily expandable.
