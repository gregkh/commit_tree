[media] media: pci: smipcie: Fix dependency for DVB_SMIPCIE

In smipcie.c, the function i2c_bit_add_bus() is called. This
function is defined by the I2C bit-banging interfaces enabled
with CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT.

As there was no dependency in Kconfig, CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT could
be set to "m" while CONFIG_DVB_SMIPCIE was set to "y", resulting
in a build error due to an undefined reference.

This patch adds the dependency on CONFIG_I2C_ALGOBIT in Kconfig
by selecting it when CONFIG_DVB_SMIPCIE is selected.
