KVM: emulator: remove code duplication in register_address{,_increment}

register_address has been a duplicate of address_mask ever since the
ancestor of __linearize was born in 90de84f50b42 (KVM: x86 emulator:
preserve an operand's segment identity, 2010-11-17).

However, we can put it to a better use by including the call to reg_read
in register_address.  Similarly, the call to reg_rmw can be moved to
register_address_increment.
