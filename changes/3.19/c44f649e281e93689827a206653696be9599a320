Btrfs: make inode.c:compress_file_range() return void

Its return value is useless, its single caller ignores it and can't do
anything with it anyway, since it's a workqueue task and not the task
calling filemap_fdatawrite_range (writepages) nor filemap_fdatawait_range().
Failure is communicated to such functions via start and end of writeback
with the respective pages tagged with an error and AS_EIO flag set in the
inode's imapping.
