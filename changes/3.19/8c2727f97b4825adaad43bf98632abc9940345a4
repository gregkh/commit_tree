ASoC: mxs: mxs-saif: Register the irq with the device name

Instead of registering the irq name with the driver name, it's better to pass
the device name so that we have a more explicit indication as to what saif
instance the irq is related:

$ cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
...
214:          4         -  59  80042000.saif
215:          0         -  58  80046000.saif
