tcp: allow for bigger reordering level

While testing upcoming Yaogong patch (converting out of order queue
into an RB tree), I hit the max reordering level of linux TCP stack.

Reordering level was limited to 127 for no good reason, and some
network setups [1] can easily reach this limit and get limited
throughput.

Allow a new max limit of 300, and add a sysctl to allow admins to even
allow bigger (or lower) values if needed.

[1] Aggregation of links, per packet load balancing, fabrics not doing
 deep packet inspections, alternative TCP congestion modules...
