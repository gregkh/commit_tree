iwlwifi: mvm: add support for WMM Access Control

After the corresponding mac80211 patch, we can now report the airtime
used for each transmitted packet and mac80211 will be able to implement
WMM-AC with that information.

To support WMM-AC in the driver then, report the airtime and advertise
support.
