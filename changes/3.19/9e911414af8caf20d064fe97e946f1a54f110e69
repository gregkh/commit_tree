    net: mv643xx_eth: Use dma_map_single() to map the skb fragments

caused a nasty regression by removing the support for highmem skb
fragments. By using page_address() to get the address of a fragment's
page, we are assuming a lowmem page. However, such assumption is incorrect,
as fragments can be in highmem pages, resulting in very nasty issues.

This commit fixes this by using the skb_frag_dma_map() helper,
which takes care of mapping the skb fragment properly. Additionally,
the type of mapping is now tracked, so it can be unmapped using
dma_unmap_page or dma_unmap_single when appropriate.

This commit also fixes the error path in txq_init() to release the
resources properly.
