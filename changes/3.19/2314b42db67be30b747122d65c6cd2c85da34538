mm: memcontrol: drop bogus RCU locking from mem_cgroup_same_or_subtree()

None of the mem_cgroup_same_or_subtree() callers actually require it to
take the RCU lock, either because they hold it themselves or they have css
references.  Remove it.

To make the API change clear, rename the leftover helper to
mem_cgroup_is_descendant() to match cgroup_is_descendant().
