staging: comedi: amplc_pci230: use comedi_buf_read_samples()

Use comedi_buf_read_samples() to read the analog output samples from
the async buffer. That function will set the COMEDI_CB_BLOCK event
when samples are read from the async buffer. In addition, the core
will also handle the end-of-scan detection and set the COMEDI_CB_EOS
event.
