arm/arm64: KVM: Rename vgic_initialized to vgic_ready

The vgic_initialized() macro currently returns the state of the
vgic->ready flag, which indicates if the vgic is ready to be used when
running a VM, not specifically if its internal state has been
initialized.

Rename the macro accordingly in preparation for a more nuanced
initialization flow.
