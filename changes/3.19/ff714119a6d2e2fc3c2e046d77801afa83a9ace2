Bluetooth: Fix L2CAP nesting level initialization location

There's no reason why all users of L2CAP would need to worry about
initializing chan->nesting to L2CAP_NESTING_NORMAL (which is important
since 0 is the same as NESTING_SMP). This patch moves the initialization
to the common place that's used to create all new channels, i.e. the
l2cap_chan_create() function.
