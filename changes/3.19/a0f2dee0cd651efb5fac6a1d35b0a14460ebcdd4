xen: add a dma_addr_t dev_addr argument to xen_dma_map_page

dev_addr is the machine address of the page.

The new parameter can be used by the ARM and ARM64 implementations of
xen_dma_map_page to find out if the page is a local page (pfn == mfn) or
a foreign page (pfn != mfn).

dev_addr could be retrieved again from the physical address, using
pfn_to_mfn, but it requires accessing an rbtree. Since we already have
the dev_addr in our hands at the call site there is no need to get the
mfn twice.
