PCI: Handle read-only BARs on AMD CS553x devices

Some AMD CS553x devices have read-only BARs because of a firmware or
hardware defect.  There's a workaround in quirk_cs5536_vsa(), but it no
longer works after 36e8164882ca ("PCI: Restore detection of read-only
BARs").  Prior to 36e8164882ca, we filled in res->start; afterwards we
leave it zeroed out.  The quirk only updated the size, so the driver tried
to use a region starting at zero, which didn't work.

Expand quirk_cs5536_vsa() to read the base addresses from the BARs and
hard-code the sizes.

On Nix's system BAR 2's read-only value is 0x6200.  Prior to 36e8164882ca,
we interpret that as a 512-byte BAR based on the lowest-order bit set.  Per
datasheet sec 5.6.1, that BAR (MFGPT) requires only 64 bytes; use that to
avoid clearing any address bits if a platform uses only 64-byte alignment.
