drm/i915: Don't deref NULL crtc in intel_get_pipe_from_connector()

If the connector would have an encoder but the encoder didn't have a
crtc we might dereference a NULL crtc here. I suppose that should never
happen due to intel_sanitize_encoder(), but let's be a bit paranoid
print a warning if we ever hit this and return INVALID_PIPE to the
caller.
