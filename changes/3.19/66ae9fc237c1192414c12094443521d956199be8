[media] stv090x: remove indent levels in stv090x_get_coldlock()

This code is needlessly complicated and checkpatch.pl complains that we
go over the 80 characters per line limit.

If we flip the "if (!lock) {" test to "if (lock) return;" then we can
remove an indent level from the rest of the function.

We can add two returns in the "if (state->srate >= 10000000) {"
condition and move the else statement back an additional indent level.

There is another "if (!lock) {" check which can be removed since we have
already checked "lock" and know it is zero at this point.  This second
check on "lock" is also a problem because it sets off a static checker
warning.  I have reviewed this code for some time to see if something
else was intended, but have concluded that it was simply an oversight
and should be removed.  Removing this duplicative check gains us an
third indent level.
