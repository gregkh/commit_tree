NFC: digital: Add NFC-DEP Initiator-side ATN Support

When an NFC-DEP Initiator times out when waiting for
a DEP_RES from the Target, its supposed to send an
ATN to the Target.  The Target should respond to the
ATN with a similar ATN PDU and the Initiator can then
resend the last non-ATN PDU that it sent.  No more
than 'N(retry,atn)' are to be send where
2 <= 'N(retry,atn)' <= 5.  If the Initiator had just
sent a NACK PDU when the timeout occurred, it is to
continue sending NACKs until 'N(retry,nack)' NACKs
have been send.  This is described in section
14.12.5.6 of the NFC-DEP Digital Protocol Spec.

The digital layer's NFC-DEP code doesn't implement
this so add that support.

The value chosen for 'N(retry,atn)' is 2.
