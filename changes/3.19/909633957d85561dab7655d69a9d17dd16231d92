arm64: fix return code check when changing emulation handler

update_insn_emulation_mode() returns 0 on success, so we should be
treating any non-zero values as failure, rather than the other way
around. Otherwise, writes to the sysctl file controlling the emulation
are ignored and immediately rolled back.
