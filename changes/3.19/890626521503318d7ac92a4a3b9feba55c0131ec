virtio: allow transports to get avail/used addresses

For virtio-1, we can theoretically have a more complex virtqueue
layout with avail and used buffers not on a contiguous memory area
with the descriptor table. For now, it's fine for a transport driver
to stay with the old layout: It needs, however, a way to access
the locations of the avail/used rings so it can register them with
the host.
