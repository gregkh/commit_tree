gpio: dwapb: fix compile errors

Whereas the DWAPB driver does not really depend on the ARM
architecture, it uses [readl|writel]_relaxed() not found on
arch such as Blackfin, so restrict this to ARM until there is
another architecture that can make use of it.

It is also using the of_node of the gpiochip, so fix this
too by requiring OF_GPIO.

All error/warnings:
