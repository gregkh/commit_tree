can: kvaser_usb: Fix state handling upon BUS_ERROR events

While being in an ERROR_WARNING state, and receiving further
bus error events with error counters still in the ERROR_WARNING
range of 97-127 inclusive, the state handling code erroneously
reverts back to ERROR_ACTIVE.

Per the CAN standard, only revert to ERROR_ACTIVE when the
error counters are less than 96.

Moreover, in certain Kvaser models, the BUS_ERROR flag is
always set along with undefined bits in the M16C status
register. Thus use bitwise operators instead of full equality
for checking that register against bus errors.
