drivers: cpuidle: Add idle-state-name description to ARM idle states

On ARM machines, where generally speaking the idle state numbering has
no fixed and standard meaning it is useful to provide a description
of the idle state inner workings for benchmarking and monitoring purposes.

This patch adds a property to the idle states bindings that if present
gives platform firmware a means of describing the idle state and export
the string description to user space.

The patch updates the DT parsing code accordingly to take the description,
if present, into consideration.
