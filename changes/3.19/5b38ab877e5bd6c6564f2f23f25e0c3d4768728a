KVM: x86: decode_modrm does not regard modrm correctly

In one occassion, decode_modrm uses the rm field after it is extended with
REX.B to determine the addressing mode. Doing so causes it not to read the
offset for rip-relative addressing with REX.B=1.

This patch moves the fetch where we already mask REX.B away instead.
