dm cache: when reloading a discard bitset allow for a different discard block size

The discard block size can change if the origin changes size or if an
old DM cache is upgraded from using a discard block size that was equal
to cache block size.

To fix this an extent of discarded blocks is established for the purpose
of translating the old discard block size to the new in-core discard
block size and set bits.  The old (potentially huge) discard bitset is
left ondisk until it is re-written using the new in-core information on
the next successful DM cache shutdown.
