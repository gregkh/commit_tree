sunvnet: Return from vnet_napi_event() if no packets to read

vnet_event_napi() may be called as part of the NAPI ->poll,
to resume reading descriptor rings. When no data is available,
descriptor ring state (e.g., rcv_nxt) needs to be reset
carefully to stay in lock-step with ldc_read(). In the interest
of simplicity, the best way to do this is to return from
vnet_event_napi() when there are no more packets to read.
The next trip through ldc_rx will correctly set up the dring state.
