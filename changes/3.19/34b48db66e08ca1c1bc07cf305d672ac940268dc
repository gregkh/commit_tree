block: remove artifical max_hw_sectors cap

Set max_sectors to the value the drivers provides as hardware limit by
default.  Linux had proper I/O throttling for a long time and doesn't
rely on a artifically small maximum I/O size anymore.  By not limiting
the I/O size by default we remove an annoying tuning step required for
most Linux installation.

Note that both the user, and if absolutely required the driver can still
impose a limit for FS requests below max_hw_sectors_kb.
