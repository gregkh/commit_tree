ath10k: speed up hw recovery

In some cases hw recovery was taking an absurdly
long time due to ath10k waiting for things that
would never really complete.

Instead of waiting for inevitable timeouts poke
all completions and wakequeues and check if it's
still worth waiting.

Reading/writing ar->state requires conf_mutex.
Since waiters might be holding it introduce a new
flag CRASH_FLUSH so it's possible to tell waiters
to abort whatever they were waiting for.
