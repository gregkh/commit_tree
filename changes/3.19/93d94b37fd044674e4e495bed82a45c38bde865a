serial: imx: Fix warning when building 'allmodconfig'

When CONFIG_SERIAL_IMX_CONSOLE=n and CONFIG_CONSOLE_POLL=y we get the following
build warning:

drivers/tty/serial/imx.c:306:13: warning: 'imx_port_ucrs_save' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
drivers/tty/serial/imx.c:315:13: warning: 'imx_port_ucrs_restore' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

imx_port_ucrs_save/restore are only used under CONFIG_SERIAL_IMX_CONSOLE, so
their definitions should be also be protected only by CONFIG_SERIAL_IMX_CONSOLE.

This was detected when building 'allmodconfig'.
