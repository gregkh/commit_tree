Bluetooth: Include ADV_IND report in Device Connected event

There are scenarios when autoconnecting to a device after the
reception of an ADV_IND report (action 0x02), in which userland
might want to examine the report's contents.

For instance, the Service Data might have changed and it would be
useful to know ahead of time before starting any GATT procedures.
Also, the ADV_IND may contain Manufacturer Specific data which would
be lost if not propagated to userland. In fact, this patch results
from the need to rebond with a device lacking persistent storage which
notifies about losing its LTK in ADV_IND reports.

This patch appends the ADV_IND report which triggered the
autoconnection to the EIR Data in the Device Connected event.
