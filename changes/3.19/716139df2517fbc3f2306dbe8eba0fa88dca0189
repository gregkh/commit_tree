arm/arm64: KVM: Don't allow creating VCPUs after vgic_initialized

When the vgic initializes its internal state it does so based on the
number of VCPUs available at the time.  If we allow KVM to create more
VCPUs after the VGIC has been initialized, we are likely to error out in
unfortunate ways later, perform buffer overflows etc.
