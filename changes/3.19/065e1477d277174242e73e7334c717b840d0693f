Most are caused by pointers marked as __iomem when they aren't or not marked as
__iomem when they should.

Also note that readl/writel already do endian conversion, so there is no need to
do it again.

saa7164_bus_set/get were a bit tricky: you have to make sure the msg endian
conversion is done at the right time, and that the code isn't using fields that
are still little endian instead of cpu-endianness.

The approach chosen is to convert just before writing to the ring buffer
and to convert it back right after reading from the ring buffer.
