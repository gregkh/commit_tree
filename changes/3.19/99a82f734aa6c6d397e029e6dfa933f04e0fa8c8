rtlwifi: rtl8192ce: Fix editing error that causes silent memory corruption

In the major update of the rtlwifi-family of drivers, there was an editing
mistake. Unfortunately, this particular error leads to memory corruption that
silently leads to failure of the system. This patch is one of three needed to
fix the kernel regression reported at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88951.
