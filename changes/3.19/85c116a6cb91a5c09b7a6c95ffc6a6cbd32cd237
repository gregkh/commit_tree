perf callchain: Make get_srcline fall back to sym+offset

When the source line is not found fall back to sym + offset.  This is
generally much more useful than a raw address.

For this we need to pass in the symbol from the caller.

For some callers it's awkward to compute, so we stay at the old
behaviour.
