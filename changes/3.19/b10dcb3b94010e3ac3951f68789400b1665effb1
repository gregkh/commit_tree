netlink: update listeners directly when removing socket

The code is now confusing to read - first in one function down
(netlink_remove) any group subscriptions are implicitly removed
by calling __sk_del_bind_node(), but the subscriber database is
only updated far later by calling netlink_update_listeners().

Move the latter call to just after removal from the list so it
is easier to follow the code.

This also enables moving the locking inside the kernel-socket
conditional, which improves the normal socket destruction path.
