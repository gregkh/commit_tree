mfd: Add support for Diolan DLN-2 devices

This patch implements the USB part of the Diolan USB-I2C/SPI/GPIO
Master Adapter DLN-2. Details about the device can be found here:

https://www.diolan.com/i2c/i2c_interface.html.

Information about the USB protocol can be found in the Programmer's
Reference Manual [1], see section 1.7.

Because the hardware has a single transmit endpoint and a single
receive endpoint the communication between the various DLN2 drivers
and the hardware will be muxed/demuxed by this driver.

Each DLN2 module will be identified by the handle field within the DLN2
message header. If a DLN2 module issues multiple commands in parallel
they will be identified by the echo counter field in the message header.

The DLN2 modules can use the dln2_transfer() function to issue a
command and wait for its response. They can also register a callback
that is going to be called when a specific event id is generated by
the device (e.g. GPIO interrupts). The device uses handle 0 for
sending events.
