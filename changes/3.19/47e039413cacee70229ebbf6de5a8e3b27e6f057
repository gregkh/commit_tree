ASoC: Add support for allocating AC'97 device before registering it

In some cases it is necessary to before additional operations after the
device has been initialized and before the device is registered. This can
for example be resetting the device.

This patch introduces a new function snd_soc_alloc_ac97_codec() which is
similar to snd_soc_new_ac97_codec() except that it does not register the
device. Any users of snd_soc_alloc_ac97_codec() are responsible for calling
device_add() manually.
