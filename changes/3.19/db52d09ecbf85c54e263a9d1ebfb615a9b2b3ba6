xfs: catch invalid negative blknos in _xfs_buf_find()

Here blkno is a daddr_t, which is a __s64; it's possible to hold
a value which is negative, and thus pass the (blkno >= eofs)
test.  Then we try to do a xfs_perag_get() for a ridiculous
agno via xfs_daddr_to_agno(), and bad things happen when that
fails, and returns a null pag which is dereferenced shortly
thereafter.
