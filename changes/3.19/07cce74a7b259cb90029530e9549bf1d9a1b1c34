PM / OPP: handle allocation of device_opp in a separate routine

Get the 'device_opp' allocation code into a separate routine to keep only the
necessary part in dev_pm_opp_add_dynamic().

Also do s/sizeof(struct device_opp)/sizeof(*dev_opp) and remove the print
message on kzalloc() failure as checkpatch warns for that.
