i2c: rk3x: handle dynamic clock rate changes correctly

The i2c input clock can change dynamically, e.g. on the RK3066 where
pclk_i2c0 and pclk_i2c1 are connected to the armclk, which changes
rate on cpu frequency scaling.

Until now, we incorrectly called clk_get_rate() while holding the
i2c->lock in rk3x_i2c_xfer() to adapt to clock rate changes.
Thanks to Huang Tao for reporting this issue.

Do it properly now using the clk notifier framework. The callback
logic was taken from i2c-cadence.c.

Also rename all misleading "i2c_rate" variables to "clk_rate", as they
describe the *input* clk rate.
