powernv: Fix OPAL tracepoint code

Patch c49f63530bb6 ("powernv: Add OPAL tracepoints") has a spurious
store to the stack:

	ld      r12,opal_tracepoint_refcount@toc(r2);           \
	std     r12,32(r1);                                     \

The store was originally used to save the current tracepoint status
so the entry and the exit tracepoints were always balanced. In the
end I just created a separate path when tracepoints are enabled.

The offset on the stack used for this store is not valid for ABIv2
and it causes strange issues. I noticed it because OPAL console input
was broken.
