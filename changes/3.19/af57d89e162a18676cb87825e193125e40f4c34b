staging: comedi: fix scan_end_arg == chanlist_len assumption

Some comedi drivers allow the `scan_end_arg` value of an asynchronous
command to be a multiple (> 1) of the `chanlist_len` although most
require them to be the same value.

`comedi_bytes_per_scan()` is incorrectly using `chanlist_len` as the
length of the scan.  Change it to use `scan_end_arg`.

`comedi_nsamples_left()` is incorrectly using `cur_chan` as the current
sample position in the scan (it is actually the current position in the
channel list).  Change it to use the actual sample position in the scan.
(Unfortunately we only have the current scan position in bytes currently,
so convert that to a sample position.)
