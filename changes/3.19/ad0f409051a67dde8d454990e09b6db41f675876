int340x_thermal/processor_thermal_device: return failure when

 there is no ACPI device object

processor_thermal_device driver needs ACPI support to work. Thus, the driver
probing should fail when there is no ACPI device object asscociated.

This fixes a NULL pointer dereference when the driver is loaded
with INT340X feature disabled in BIOS.
