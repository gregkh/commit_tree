drivers: base: support cpu cache information interface to userspace via sysfs

This patch adds initial support for providing processor cache information
to userspace through sysfs interface. This is based on already existing
implementations(x86, ia64, s390 and powerpc) and hence the interface is
intended to be fully compatible.

The main purpose of this generic support is to avoid further code
duplication to support new architectures and also to unify all the existing
different implementations.

This implementation maintains the hierarchy of cache objects which reflects
the system's cache topology. Cache devices are instantiated as needed as
CPUs come online. The cache information is replicated per-cpu even if they are
shared. A per-cpu array of cache information maintained is used mainly for
sysfs-related book keeping.

It also implements the shared_cpu_map attribute, which is essential for
enabling both kernel and user-space to discover the system's overall cache
topology.

This patch also add the missing ABI documentation for the cacheinfo sysfs
interface already, which is well defined and widely used.
