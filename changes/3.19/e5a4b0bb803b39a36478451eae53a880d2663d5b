switch memcpy_to_msg() and skb_copy{,_and_csum}_datagram_msg() to primitives

... making both non-draining.  That means that tcp_recvmsg() becomes
non-draining.  And _that_ would break iscsit_do_rx_data() unless we
	a) make sure tcp_recvmsg() is uniformly non-draining (it is)
	b) make sure it copes with arbitrary (including shifted)
iov_iter (it does, all it uses is iov_iter primitives)
	c) make iscsit_do_rx_data() initialize ->msg_iter only once.

Fortunately, (c) is doable with minimal work and we are rid of one
the two places where kernel send/recvmsg users would be unhappy with
non-draining behaviour.

Actually, that makes all but one of ->recvmsg() instances iov_iter-clean.
The exception is skcipher_recvmsg() and it also isn't hard to convert
to primitives (iov_iter_get_pages() is needed there).  That'll wait
a bit - there's some interplay with ->sendmsg() path for that one.
