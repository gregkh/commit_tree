ocfs2: Fix xattr check in ocfs2_get_xattr_nolock()

ocfs2_get_xattr_nolock() checks whether inode has any extended attributes
(OCFS2_HAS_XATTR_FL).  If not, it just sets 'ret' to -ENODATA but
continues with checking inline and external attributes anyway (which is
pointless although it does not harm).  Just return immediately when we
know there are no extended attributes in the inode.
