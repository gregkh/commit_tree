IB/srp: Use block layer tags

Since the block layer already contains functionality to assign
a tag to each request, use that functionality instead of
reimplementing that functionality in the SRP initiator driver.
This change makes the free_reqs list superfluous. Hence remove
that list.

[hch: updated to use .use_blk_tags instead scsi_activate_tcq]
