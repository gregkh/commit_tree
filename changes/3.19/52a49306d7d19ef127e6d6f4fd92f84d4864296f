mailbox: Don't unnecessarily re-arm the polling timer

poll_txdone() will unconditionally re-arm the polling timer if there was
an active request, even if the active request completed and no other
requests were submitted.  This is fixed by:
 - only re-arming the timer if the controller reported that the current
   transmission has not completed, and,
 - moving the call to poll_txdone() into msg_submit() so that the
   controller gets polled (and the timer re-armed, if necessary) whenever
   a new message is submitted.
