phonet: Replace calls to __skb_alloc_page with __dev_alloc_page

Replace the calls to __skb_alloc_page that are passed NULL with calls to
__dev_alloc_page.

In addition remove __GFP_COLD flag from allocations as we only want it for
the Rx buffer which is taken care of by __dev_alloc_skb, not for any
secondary allocations such as the queue element transmit descriptors.
