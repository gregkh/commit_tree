tty: Fix hung task on pty hangup

When hanging up one end of a pty pair, there may be waiting
readers/writers on the other end which may not exit, preventing
tty_ldisc_lock_pair() from acquiring the other side's ldisc lock.

Only acquire this side's ldisc lock; although this will no longer
prevent the other side from writing new input, that input will not
be processing until after the ldisc hangup is complete.
