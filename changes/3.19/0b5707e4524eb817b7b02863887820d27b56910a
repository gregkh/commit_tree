sunrpc: require svc_create callers to pass in meaningful shutdown routine

Currently all svc_create callers pass in NULL for the shutdown parm,
which then gets fixed up to be svc_rpcb_cleanup if the service uses
rpcbind.

Simplify this by instead having the the only caller that requires it
(lockd) pass in svc_rpcb_cleanup and get rid of the special casing.
