ARM: 8224/1: Add unwinding support for memmove function

The memmove function never had unwinding annotations added.
Currently, when accessing invalid pointer by memmove occurs the
backtrace shown will stop at memmove or some completely unrelated
function. Add unwinding annotations in hopes of getting a more
useful backtrace in following cases:
1. die on accessing invalid pointer by memmove
2. kprobe trapped at any instruction within memmove
3. interrupted at any instruction within memmove
