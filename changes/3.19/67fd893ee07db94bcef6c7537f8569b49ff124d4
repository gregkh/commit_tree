ethernet/intel: Use napi_alloc_skb

This change replaces calls to netdev_alloc_skb_ip_align with
napi_alloc_skb.  The advantage of napi_alloc_skb is currently the fact that
the page allocation doesn't make use of any irq disable calls.

There are few spots where I couldn't replace the calls as the buffer
allocation routine is called as a part of init which is outside of the
softirq context.
