drm/i915: Make mmio flip wait for seqno in the work function

This simplifies the code quite a bit compared to iterating over all
rings during the ring interrupt.

Also, it allows us to drop the mmio_flip spinlock, since the mmio_flip
struct is only accessed in two places. The first is when the flip is
queued and the other when the mmio writes are done. Since a flip cannot
be queued while there is a pending flip, the two paths shouldn't ever
run in parallel. We might need to revisit that if support for replacing
flips is implemented though.

v2: Don't hold dev->struct_mutext while waiting (Chris)

v3: Make the wait uninterruptable (Chris)
