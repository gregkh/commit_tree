tipc: any name table member must be protected under name table lock

As tipc_nametbl_lock is used to protect name_table structure, the lock
must be held while all members of name_table structure are accessed.
However, the lock is not obtained while a member of name_table
structure - local_publ_count is read in tipc_nametbl_publish(), as
a consequence, an inconsistent value of local_publ_count might be got.
