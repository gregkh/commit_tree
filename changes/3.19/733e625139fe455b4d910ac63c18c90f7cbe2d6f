ACPI: Allow drivers to match using Device Tree compatible property

We have lots of existing Device Tree enabled drivers and allocating
separate _HID for each is not feasible. Instead we allocate special _HID
"PRP0001" that means that the match should be done using Device Tree
compatible property using driver's .of_match_table instead if the driver
is missing .acpi_match_table.

If there is a need to distinguish from where the device is enumerated
(DT/ACPI) driver can check dev->of_node or ACPI_COMPATION(dev).
