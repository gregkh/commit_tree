caif: remove wrong dev_net_set() call

src_net points to the netns where the netlink message has been received. This
netns may be different from the netns where the interface is created (because
the user may add IFLA_NET_NS_[PID|FD]). In this case, src_net is the link netns.

It seems wrong to override the netns in the newlink() handler because if it
was not already src_net, it means that the user explicitly asks to create the
netdevice in another netns.
