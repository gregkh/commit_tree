thermal: imx: pass cpu_present_mask to cpufreq_cooling_register()

cpufreq_cooling_register() expects mask of all the CPUs where frequency
constraint is applicable.

This platform has more than one CPU to which these constraints will apply and so
passing mask of only CPU0 wouldn't be sufficient. Also, this platform has a
single cluster of CPUs and the constraint applies to all CPUs.

If CPU0 is hoplugged out then we may face strange BUGs as cpu_cooling framework
isn't aware of any siblings sharing clock line.

Fix it by passing cpu_present_mask to cpufreq_cooling_register().
