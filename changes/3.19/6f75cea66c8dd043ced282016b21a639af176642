drm/atomic: Only destroy connector states with connection mutex held

Otherwise the connector might have been unplugged and destroyed while
we didn't look. Yet another fallout from DP MST hotplugging that I
didn't consider.

To make sure we get this right add an appropriate WARN_ON to
drm_atomic_state_clear (obviously only when we actually have a state
to clear up). And reorder all the state_clear and backoff calls to
make it work out properly.
