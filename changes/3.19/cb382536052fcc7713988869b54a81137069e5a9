usb: gadget: f_hid: convert to new function interface with backward compatibility

Converting hid to the new function interface requires converting
the USB hid's function code and its users.

This patch converts the f_hid.c to the new function interface.

The file can now be compiled into a separate usb_f_hid.ko module.

The old function interface is provided by means of a preprocessor
conditional directives. After all users are converted, the old interface
can be removed.
