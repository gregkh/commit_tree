tracing: Remove extra call to init_ftrace_syscalls()

trace_init() calls init_ftrace_syscalls() and then calls trace_event_init()
which also calls init_ftrace_syscalls(). It makes more sense to only
call it from trace_event_init().

Calling it twice wastes memory, as it allocates the syscall events twice,
and loses the first copy of it.
