ARM: shmobile: armadillo800eva legacy: Add missing A3SP pm domain devices

Commit 802a5639aa7041b2 ("ARM: shmobile: r8a7740: add A3SP pm domain
support") added the A3SP power domain, but forgot to hook up the TPU,
SDHI0/1, and MMCIF hardware blocks.

Note: As the default PM QoS latency constraint for SDHI is only 100 µs
(cfr. commit c419e611c3c59c0e ("tmio_mmc / PM: Use PM QoS latency
constraint"), while DEFAULT_DEV_LATENCY_NS is 250000, suspend fails with
-EBUSY, unless the constraint is increased first to more than 500 µs
using e.g.

    echo 501 > /sys/devices/platform/sh_mobile_sdhi.0/power/pm_qos_resume_latency_us
