dm cache policy mq: tweak algorithm that decides when to promote a block

Rather than maintaining a separate promote_threshold variable that we
periodically update we now use the hit count of the oldest clean
block.  Also add a fudge factor to discourage demoting dirty blocks.

With some tests this has a sizeable difference, because the old code
was too eager to demote blocks.  For example, device-mapper-test-suite's
git_extract_cache_quick test goes from taking 190 seconds, to 142
(linear on spindle takes 250).
