nios2: Use preempt_schedule_irq

Follow aa0d53260596 ("ia64: Use preempt_schedule_irq") and use
preempt_schedule_irq instead of enabling/disabling interrupts and
messing around with PREEMPT_ACTIVE in the nios2 low-level preemption
code ourselves. Also get rid of the now needless re-check for
TIF_NEED_RESCHED, preempt_schedule_irq will already take care of
rescheduling.

This also fixes the following build error when building with
CONFIG_PREEMPT:

arch/nios2/kernel/built-in.o: In function `need_resched':
arch/nios2/kernel/entry.S:374: undefined reference to `PREEMPT_ACTIVE'
