s390/traps: print interrupt code and instruction length code

It always confuses me to see the mixed instruction length code and
interruption code on user space faults, while the message clearly
says it is the interruption code.
So split the value and print both values separately. Also add the ILC
output to the die() message, so thar user and kernel space faults
contain the same information.
