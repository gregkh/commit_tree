mac802154: add synchronization handling

This patch adds synchronization handling in start and stop driver ops
calls. This patch is mostly grab from mac80211 which was introduced by
commit ea77f12f2cc0f31168f2e0259e65a22202ac4dc2 ("mac80211: remove
tasklet enable/disable"). This is to be sure that we don't run into same
issues.
