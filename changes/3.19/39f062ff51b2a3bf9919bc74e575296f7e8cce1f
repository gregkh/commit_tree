KVM: x86: Generate #UD when memory operand is required

Certain x86 instructions that use modrm operands only allow memory operand
(i.e., mod012), and cause a #UD exception otherwise. KVM ignores this fact.
Currently, the instructions that are such and are emulated by KVM are MOVBE,
MOVNTPS, MOVNTPD and MOVNTI.  MOVBE is the most blunt example, since it may be
emulated by the host regardless of MMIO.

The fix introduces a new group for handling such instructions, marking mod3 as
illegal instruction.
