devicetree: document the "qemu" and "virtio" vendor prefixes

The QEMU open source machine emulator and virtualizer presents firmware
and operating systems running in virtual machines ("guests") with purely
virtual hardware (ie. hardware that has never existed in physical form).
Since QEMU exposes some of these devices in a DTB, it makes sense to
define "qemu" and "virtio" as vendor prefixes.

The qemu definition is from [1], revision 4451 (22:24, 25 November 2014).

The virtio definition is composed from [2] and [3].
