KVM: x86: MOV to CR3 can set bit 63

Although Intel SDM mentions bit 63 is reserved, MOV to CR3 can have bit 63 set.
As Intel SDM states in section 4.10.4 "Invalidation of TLBs and
Paging-Structure Caches": " MOV to CR3. ... If CR4.PCIDE = 1 and bit 63 of the
instructionâ€™s source operand is 0 ..."

In other words, bit 63 is not reserved. KVM emulator currently consider bit 63
as reserved. Fix it.
