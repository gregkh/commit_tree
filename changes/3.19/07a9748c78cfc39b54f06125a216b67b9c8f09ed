arm/arm64: kvm: drop inappropriate use of kvm_is_mmio_pfn()

Instead of using kvm_is_mmio_pfn() to decide whether a host region
should be stage 2 mapped with device attributes, add a new static
function kvm_is_device_pfn() that disregards RAM pages with the
reserved bit set, as those should usually not be mapped as device
memory.
