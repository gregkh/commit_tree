staging, rtl8192e, LLVMLinux: Remove unused prototype

MgntQuery_MgntFrameTxRate is only used within rtllib_softmac.c, so it really
should be static instead of extern.

Since it is currently extern a warning is generated because a different
function of the same name is defined staticlly in ieee80211_softmac.c

Removing the incorrect extern declaration and defining the rtllib_softmac
version of this routine static fixes the warning.
