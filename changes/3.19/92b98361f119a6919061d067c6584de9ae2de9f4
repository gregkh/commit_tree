xprtrdma: Return an errno from rpcrdma_register_external()

The RPC/RDMA send_request method and the chunk registration code
expects an errno from the registration function. This allows
the upper layers to distinguish between a recoverable failure
(for example, temporary memory exhaustion) and a hard failure
(for example, a bug in the registration logic).
