ARM: OMAP2+: hwmod: drop unnecessary list initialization

ml->node and sl->node are currently initialized
by means of INIT_LIST_HEAD(). That initialiation
is followed by a list_add() call.

Looking at what both these functions do we will have:

	ml->node.next = &ml->node;
	ml->node.prev = &ml->node;
	oi->master->master_ports.next.prev = &ml->node;
	ml->node.next = &oi->master->master_ports.next;
	ml->node.prev = &oi->master->master_ports;
	oi->master->master_ports.next = &ml->node;

from this, it's clear that both INIT_LIST_HEAD() calls
are unnecessary and can be safely removed.
