usb: serial: handle -ENODEV quietly in generic_submit_read_urb

If a USB serial device (e.g. /dev/ttyUSB0) with an active program is
unplugged, an -ENODEV (19) error will be produced after it gives up
trying to resubmit a read.

  usb_serial_generic_submit_read_urb - usb_submit_urb failed: -19

Add -ENODEV as one of the permanent errors along with -EPERM that
usb_serial_generic_submit_read_urb() handles quietly without an error.
