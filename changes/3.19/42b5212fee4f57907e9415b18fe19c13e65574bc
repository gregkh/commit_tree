xen-netback: stop the guest rx thread after a fatal error

After commit e9d8b2c2968499c1f96563e6522c56958d5a1d0d (xen-netback:
disable rogue vif in kthread context), a fatal (protocol) error would
leave the guest Rx thread spinning, wasting CPU time.  Commit
ecf08d2dbb96d5a4b4bcc53a39e8d29cc8fef02e (xen-netback: reintroduce
guest Rx stall detection) made this even worse by removing a
cond_resched() from this path.

Since a fatal error is non-recoverable, just allow the guest Rx thread
to exit.  This requires taking additional refs to the task so the
thread exiting early is handled safely.
