Btrfs, raid56: don't change bbio and raid_map

Because we will reuse bbio and raid_map during the scrub later, it is
better that we don't change any variant of bbio and don't free it at
the end of IO request. So we introduced similar variants into the raid
bio, and don't access those bbio's variants any more.
