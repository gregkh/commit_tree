arm64: log physical ID of boot CPU

In certain debugging scenarios it's useful to know the physical ID (i.e.
the MPIDR_EL1.Aff* fields) of the boot CPU, but we don't currently log
this as we do for 32-bit ARM kernels.

This patch makes the kernel log the physical ID of the boot CPU early in
the boot process. The CPU logical map initialisation is folded in to
smp_setup_processor_id (which contrary to its name is also called by UP
kernels). This is called before setup_arch, so should not adversely
affect existing cpu_logical_map users.
