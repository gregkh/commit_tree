ftracetest: Add --verbose option for showing echo output

Add --verbose/-v option for showing echo output in testcases.
This is good for checking the progress of testcases which
take a longer time to run.

To implement this feature, all the testcase failures are
captured in ftracetest and send signal to set SIG_RESULT=FAIL.
