vio: create routines for inc,dec vio dring indexes

Both sunvdc and sunvnet implemented distinct functionality for incrementing
and decrementing dring indexes. Create common functions for use by both
from the sunvnet versions, which were chosen since they will still work
correctly in case a non power of two ring size is used.
