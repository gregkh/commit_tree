drm/i915: Bikeshed rpm functions name a bit.

- fini goes with init, so call it intel_power_domains_fini. While
  at it shovel some of the fini code that leaked out of it back in.

- give power_enabled functions the verb _is_ to make the meaning clearer.
  Also use a __ prefix instead of _unlocked to really discourage users.

- rename runtime_pm_init/fini to enable/disable since that's what they do.
