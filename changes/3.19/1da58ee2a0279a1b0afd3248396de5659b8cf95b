mm: vmscan: count only dirty pages as congested

shrink_page_list() counts all pages with a mapping, including clean pages,
toward nr_congested if they're on a write-congested BDI.
shrink_inactive_list() then sets ZONE_CONGESTED if nr_dirty ==
nr_congested.  Fix this apples-to-oranges comparison by only counting
pages for nr_congested if they count for nr_dirty.
