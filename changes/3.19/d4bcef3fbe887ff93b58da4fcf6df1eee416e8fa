net: Fix vlan_get_protocol for stacked vlan

vlan_get_protocol() could not get network protocol if a skb has a 802.1ad
vlan tag or multiple vlans, which caused incorrect checksum calculation
in several drivers.

Fix vlan_get_protocol() to retrieve network protocol instead of incorrect
vlan protocol.

As the logic is the same as skb_network_protocol(), create a common helper
function __vlan_get_protocol() and call it from existing functions.
