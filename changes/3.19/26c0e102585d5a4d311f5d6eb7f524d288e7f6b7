xen-netback: support frontends without feature-rx-notify again

Commit bc96f648df1bbc2729abbb84513cf4f64273a1f1 (xen-netback: make
feature-rx-notify mandatory) incorrectly assumed that there were no
frontends in use that did not support this feature.  But the frontend
driver in MiniOS does not and since this is used by (qemu) stubdoms,
these stopped working.

Netback sort of works as-is in this mode except:

- If there are no Rx requests and the internal Rx queue fills, only
  the drain timeout will wake the thread.  The default drain timeout
  of 10 s would give unacceptable pauses.

- If an Rx stall was detected and the internal Rx queue is drained,
  then the Rx thread would never wake.

Handle these two cases (when feature-rx-notify is disabled) by:

- Reducing the drain timeout to 30 ms.

- Disabling Rx stall detection.
