IB/iser: Fix race between iser connection teardown and scsi TMFs

In certain scenarios (target kill with live IO) scsi TMFs may race
with iser RDMA teardown, which might cause NULL dereference on iser IB
device handle (which might have been freed). In this case we take a
conditional lock for TMFs and check the connection state (avoid
introducing lock contention in the IO path). This is indeed best
effort approach, but sufficient to survive multi targets sudden death
while heavy IO is inflight.

While we are on it, add a nice kernel-doc style documentation.
