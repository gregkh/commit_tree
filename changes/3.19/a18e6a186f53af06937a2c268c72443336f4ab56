netlink: Don't reorder loads/stores before marking mmap netlink frame as available

Each mmap Netlink frame contains a status field which indicates
whether the frame is unused, reserved, contains data or needs to
be skipped. Both loads and stores may not be reordeded and must
complete before the status field is changed and another CPU might
pick up the frame for use. Use an smp_mb() to cover needs of both
types of callers to netlink_set_status(), callers which have been
reading data frame from the frame, and callers which have been
filling or releasing and thus writing to the frame.

- Example code path requiring a smp_rmb():
  memcpy(skb->data, (void *)hdr + NL_MMAP_HDRLEN, hdr->nm_len);
  netlink_set_status(hdr, NL_MMAP_STATUS_UNUSED);

- Example code path requiring a smp_wmb():
  hdr->nm_uid	= from_kuid(sk_user_ns(sk), NETLINK_CB(skb).creds.uid);
  hdr->nm_gid	= from_kgid(sk_user_ns(sk), NETLINK_CB(skb).creds.gid);
  netlink_frame_flush_dcache(hdr);
  netlink_set_status(hdr, NL_MMAP_STATUS_VALID);
