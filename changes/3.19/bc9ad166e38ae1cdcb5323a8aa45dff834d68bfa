net: introduce napi_schedule_irqoff()

napi_schedule() can be called from any context and has to mask hard
irqs.

Add a variant that can only be called from hard interrupts handlers
or when irqs are already masked.

Many NIC drivers can use it from their hard IRQ handler instead of
generic variant.
