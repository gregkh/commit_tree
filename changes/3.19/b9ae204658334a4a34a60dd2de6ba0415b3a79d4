staging: comedi: addi_apci_3120: remove analog output reset

The apci3120_reset() function is called at the end of the (*auto_attach) and
with the (*detach) is called to unload the driver. Part of this function
resets all the analog output channels to 0V.

There are two problems with this.
1) Only the APCI-3120 has analog outputs, the APCI-3001 does not.
2) The DA_READY bit in the status register needs to be checked before each
   write to update the analog outputs. It's unknown what the DA_READY bit
   does on the APCI-3001 board.

Just remove the analog output reset to avoid any problems.

Also, remove the unnecessary udelay() in apci3120_reset().
