s390/scm_block: allocate aidaw pages only when necessary

AOBs (the structure describing the HW request) need to be 4K
aligned but very little of that page is actually used. With
this patch we place aidaws at the end of the AOB page and only
allocate a separate page for aidaws when we have to (lists of
aidaws must not cross page boundaries).
