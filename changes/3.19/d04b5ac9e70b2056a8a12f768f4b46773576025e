cfg80211/mac80211: allow any interface to send channel switch notifications

For multi-vif channel switches, we want to send
NL80211_CMD_CH_SWITCH_NOTIFY to the userspace to let it decide whether
other interfaces need to be moved as well.  This is needed when we
want a P2P GO interface to follow the channel of a station, for
example.

Modify the code so that all interfaces can send CSA notifications.
Additionally, send notifications for STA CSA as well.
