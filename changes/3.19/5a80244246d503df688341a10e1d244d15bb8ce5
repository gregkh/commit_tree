s390/bpf: Fix JMP_JGE_K (A >= K) and JMP_JGT_K (A > K)

Currently the signed COMPARE HALFWORD IMMEDIATE (chi) and COMPARE (c)
instructions are used to compare "A" with "K". This is not correct
because "A" and "K" are both unsigned. To fix this remove the
chi instruction (no unsigned analogon available) and use the
unsigned COMPARE LOGICAL (cl) instruction instead of COMPARE (c).
