mac802154: move phy settings into netlink receive

All PHY attributes should be directly set to the transceiver after netlink.
MAC attributes should be set by interface up. Currently the macparams
netlink cmd contains mixed attributes of phy and mac settings. This patch
moves all phy settings to the netlink receive function for setting macparams.
This is the only way which doesn't change the userspace API and keep the
deprecated netlink interface alive.
