tipc: add link get/dump to new netlink api

Add TIPC_NL_LINK_GET command to the new tipc netlink API.

This command supports dumping all information about all links
(including the broadcast link) or getting all information about a
specific link (not the broadcast link).

The information about a link includes name, transmission info,
properties and link statistics.

As the tipc broadcast link is special we unfortunately have to treat
it specially. It is a deliberate decision not to abstract the
broadcast link on this (API) level.

Netlink logical layout of link response message:
