vhost/net: force len for TX to host endian

vhost/net keeps a copy of the used ring in host memory but (ab)uses
the length field for internal house-keeping. This works because the
length in the used ring for tx is always 0. In order to suppress sparse
warnings, we force native endianness here.
Note that these values are never exposed to guests.
