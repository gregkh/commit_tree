virtio_ccw: legacy: don't negotiate rev 1/features

Legacy balloon device doesn't pretend to support revision 1 or 64 bit
features.

But just in case someone implements a broken one that does, let's not
even try to drive legacy only devices using revision 1, and let's not
give them a chance to say they support VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 by not reading
or writing high feature bits.
