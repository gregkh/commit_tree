samples: bpf: large eBPF program in C

sockex2_kern.c is purposefully large eBPF program in C.
llvm compiles ~200 lines of C code into ~300 eBPF instructions.

It's similar to __skb_flow_dissect() to demonstrate that complex packet parsing
can be done by eBPF.
Then it uses (struct flow_keys)->dst IP address (or hash of ipv6 dst) to keep
stats of number of packets per IP.
User space loads eBPF program, attaches it to loopback interface and prints
dest_ip->#packets stats every second.

Usage:
$sudo samples/bpf/sockex2
ip 127.0.0.1 count 19
ip 127.0.0.1 count 178115
ip 127.0.0.1 count 369437
ip 127.0.0.1 count 559841
ip 127.0.0.1 count 750539
