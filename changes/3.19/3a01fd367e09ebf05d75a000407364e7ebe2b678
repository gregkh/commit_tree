drm/radeon: fix VM flush on CIK (v3)

We need to wait for the GPUVM flush to complete.  There
was some confusion as to how this mechanism was supposed
to work.  The operation is not atomic.  For GPU initiated
invalidations you need to read back a VM register to
introduce enough latency for the update to complete.

v2: drop gart changes
v3: just read back rather than polling
