Staging: lustre: lnet: lnet: Better cookie gen

api-ni.c uses do_gettimeofday to get a 'cookie' or timestamp.
This patch replaces it with ktime_get_ns for the following reasons:
1. ktime_get_ns returns a __u64 which is safer than 'struct timeval'
which will overflow on 32-bit systems in year 2038 and beyond.
2. Improved resolution: nsecs instead of usecs.
3. Reduced compute: ktime_get_ns is faster than the multiply/add
   combination used in this function
