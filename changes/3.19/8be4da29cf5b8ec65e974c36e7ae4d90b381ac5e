ASoC: dapm: Mark endpoints instead of IO widgets dirty during suspend/resume

The state of endpoint widgets is affected by that card's power state.
Endpoint widgets that do no have the ignore_suspend flag set will be
considered inactive during suspend. So they have to be re-checked and marked
dirty after the card's power state changes. Currently the input and output
widgets are marked dirty instead, this works most of the time since
typically a path from one endpoint to another will go via a input or output
widget. But marking the endpoints dirty is technically more correct and will
also work for odd corner cases.
