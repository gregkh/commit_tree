[media] si2157: Add support for Si2146-A10

The Silicon Labs Si2146 tuner seems to work with the same driver as the Si2157,
but there a few exceptions. The powerup command seems to be quite a bit
different. In addition there's a property 0207 that requires a different value.
Thus another entry is created in the si2157_id table to support also si2146 in
this driver.

The datasheet is available on manufacturer's website:
