KVM: S390: Create helper function get_guest_storage_key

Define get_guest_storage_key which can be used to get the value of a guest
storage key. This compliments the functionality provided by the helper function
set_guest_storage_key. Both functions are needed for live migration of s390
guests that use storage keys.
