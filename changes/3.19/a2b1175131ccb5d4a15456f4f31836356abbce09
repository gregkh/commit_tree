ARM: common: edma: add suspend resume hook

This patch makes the edma driver resume correctly after suspend. Tested
on an AM33xx platform with cyclic audio streams and omap_hsmmc.

All information can be reconstructed by already known runtime
information.

As we now use some functions that were previously only used from __init
context, annotations had to be dropped.
