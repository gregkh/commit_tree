staging: unisys: fix CamelCase channel constants

The channel definitions in channel_guid.h contain several CamelCase
constants. Fix these so they are no longer incorrectly cased, and use
the name spar instead of the old "ultra" reference. Also, rename the
corresponding UUID macros to match. Update all references to constants
or UUID macros that were changed.

Fix CamelCase names:
UltraVhbaChannelProtocolGuid => spar_vhba_channel_protocol_uuid
UltraVnicChannelProtocolGuid => spar_vnic_channel_protocol_uuid
UltraSIOVMGuid => spar_siovm_uuid
UltraControlDirectorChannelProtocolGuid =>
		spar_controldirector_channel_protocol_uuid
