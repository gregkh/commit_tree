x86: irq: Fix placement of mp_should_keep_irq()

While f3761db164 ("x86, irq: Fix build error caused by
9eabc99a635a77cbf09") addressed the original build problem,
declaration, inline stub, and definition still seem misplaced: It isn't
really IO-APIC related, and it's being used solely in arch/x86/pci/.
This also means stubbing it out when !CONFIG_X86_IO_APIC was at least
questionable.
