ASoC: ac97: Push snd_ac97 pointer to the driver level

Now that the ASoC core no longer needs a handle to the AC'97 device that is
associated with a CODEC we can remove it from the snd_soc_codec struct and
push it into the individual driver state structs like we do for other
communication buses. Doing so creates a clean separation between the AC'97
bus support and the ASoC core.
