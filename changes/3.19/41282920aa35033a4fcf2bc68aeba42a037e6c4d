ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: Don't bypass settings if cpu-dai is Master

When cpu-dai is the DAI Master (CBM_CFx), it may need some configurations,
set_sysclk() call for eample, for cpu-dai side in the hw_params(), even if
the set_bias_level() has already taken care of the codec-dai side.

So this patch just simply adds an additional condition.
