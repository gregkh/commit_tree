quota: Allow each filesystem to specify which quota types it supports

Currently all filesystems supporting VFS quota support user and group
quotas. With introduction of project quotas this is going to change so
make sure filesystem isn't called for quota type it doesn't support by
introduction of a bitmask determining which quota types each filesystem
supports.
