ALSA: firewire-lib: remove rx_blocks_for_midi quirk

There are several devices that expect to receive MIDI data only in the
first eight data blocks of a packet.  If the driver restricts the data
rate to the allowed rate (as mandated by the specification, but not yet
implemented by this driver), this happens naturally.  Therefore, there
is no reason to ever try to use more data packets with any device.
