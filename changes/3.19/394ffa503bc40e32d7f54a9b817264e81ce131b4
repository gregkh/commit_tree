blk: introduce generic io stat accounting help function

Many block drivers accounting io stat based on bio (e.g. NVMe...),
the blk_account_io_start/end() which is based on request
does not make sense to them, so here we introduce the similar help
function named generic_start/end_io_acct base on raw sectors, and it can
simplify some driver's open io accounting code.
