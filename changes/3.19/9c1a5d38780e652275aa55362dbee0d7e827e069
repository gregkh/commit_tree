kvm: optimize GFN to memslot lookup with large slots amount

Current linear search doesn't scale well when
large amount of memslots is used and looked up slot
is not in the beginning memslots array.
Taking in account that memslots don't overlap, it's
possible to switch sorting order of memslots array from
'npages' to 'base_gfn' and use binary search for
memslot lookup by GFN.

As result of switching to binary search lookup times
are reduced with large amount of memslots.

Following is a table of search_memslot() cycles
during WS2008R2 guest boot.
