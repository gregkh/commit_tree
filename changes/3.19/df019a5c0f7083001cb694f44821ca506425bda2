clk: samsung: exynos4: set parent of sclk_hdmiphy to hdmi

sclk_hdmiphy clock is generated by HDMI-PHY and depends on hdmi gate clock.
The patch models this dependency using parent/child hirerarchy.

The patch fixes issue with system hangs during mixer device access, mixer uses
sclk_hdmiphy descendant clock.
