hwmon: (pmbus) Add regulator support

Add support for simple on/off control of each channel.

To add regulator support, the pmbus part driver needs to add
regulator_desc information and number of regulators to its
pmbus_driver_info struct.

regulator_desc can be declared using default macro for a
regulator (PMBUS_REGULATOR) that is in pmbus.h

The regulator_init_data can be initialized from either
platform data or the device tree.
