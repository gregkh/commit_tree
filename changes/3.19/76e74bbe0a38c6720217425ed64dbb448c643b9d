sunvdc: reconnect ldc after vds service domain restarts

This change enables the sunvdc driver to reconnect and recover if a vds
service domain is disconnected or bounced.

By default, it will wait indefinitely for the service domain to become
available again, but will honor a non-zero vdc-timout md property if one
is set. If a timeout is reached, any in-progress I/O's are completed
with -EIO.
