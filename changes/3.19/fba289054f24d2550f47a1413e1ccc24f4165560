ARM: 8298/1: ARM_KERNMEM_PERMS only works with MMU enabled

The recently added ARM_KERNMEM_PERMS feature works by manipulating
the kernel page tables, which obviously requires an MMU. Trying
to enable this feature when the MMU is disabled results in a lot
of compile errors in mm/init.c, so let's add a Kconfig dependency
to avoid that case.
