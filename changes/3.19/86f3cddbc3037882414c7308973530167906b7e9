udp_diag: Fix socket skipping within chain

While working on rhashtable walking I noticed that the UDP diag
dumping code is buggy.  In particular, the socket skipping within
a chain never happens, even though we record the number of sockets
that should be skipped.

As this code was supposedly copied from TCP, this patch does what
TCP does and resets num before we walk a chain.
