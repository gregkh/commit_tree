arm64: fix missing asm/pgtable-hwdef.h include in asm/processor.h

On next-20150105, defconfig compilation breaks with:

./arch/arm64/include/asm/processor.h:47:32: error: ‘PHYS_MASK’ undeclared (first use in this function)

Fix by including asm/pgtable-hwdef.h, where PHYS_MASK is defined.

This second version incorporates a comment from Mark Rutland
<mark.rutland@arm.com> to keep the includes in alphabetical order
by filename.
