sched: Refactor task_struct to use numa_faults instead of numa_* pointers

This patch simplifies task_struct by removing the four numa_* pointers
in the same array and replacing them with the array pointer. By doing this,
on x86_64, the size of task_struct is reduced by 3 ulong pointers (24 bytes on
x86_64).

A new parameter is added to the task_faults_idx function so that it can return
an index to the correct offset, corresponding with the old precalculated
pointers.

All of the code in sched/ that depended on task_faults_idx and numa_* was
changed in order to match the new logic.
