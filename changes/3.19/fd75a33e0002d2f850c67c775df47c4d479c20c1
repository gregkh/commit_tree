MIPS: ELF: fix loading o32 binaries on 64-bit kernels

Commit 90cee759f08a ("MIPS: ELF: Set FP mode according to .MIPS.abiflags")
introduced checking of the .MIPS.abiflags ELF section but did so through
the native sized "elfhdr" and "elf_phdr" structures regardless whether the
ELF was actually 32-bit or 64-bit. This produces wrong results when trying
to use a 64-bit kernel to load o32 ELF files.

Change the uses of the generic elf structures to their 32-bit versions.
Since the code bails out on any 64-bit cases, this is OK until they are
implemented.
