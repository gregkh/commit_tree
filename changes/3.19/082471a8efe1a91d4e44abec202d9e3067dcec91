arm64: fix missing linux/bug.h include in asm/arch_timer.h

On next-20150105, defconfig compilation breaks with:

./arch/arm64/include/asm/arch_timer.h:112:2: error: implicit declaration of function ‘BUG’ [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

Fix by including linux/bug.h, where the BUG macro is defined.

This second version incorporates a comment from Mark Rutland
<mark.rutland@arm.com> to keep the includes in alphabetical order
by filename.
