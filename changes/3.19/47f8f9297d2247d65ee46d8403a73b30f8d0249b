fs/proc/meminfo.c: include cma info in proc/meminfo

This patch include CMA info (CMATotal, CMAFree) in /proc/meminfo.
Currently, in a CMA enabled system, if somebody wants to know the total
CMA size declared, there is no way to tell, other than the dmesg or
/var/log/messages logs.

With this patch we are showing the CMA info as part of meminfo, so that it
can be determined at any point of time.  This will be populated only when
CMA is enabled.

Below is the sample output from a ARM based device with RAM:512MB and CMA:16MB.

  MemTotal:         471172 kB
  MemFree:          111712 kB
  MemAvailable:     271172 kB

  CmaTotal:          16384 kB
  CmaFree:            6144 kB
