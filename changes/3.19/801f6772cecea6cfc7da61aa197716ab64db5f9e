arm64: KVM: Fix HCR setting for 32bit guests

Commit b856a59141b1 (arm/arm64: KVM: Reset the HCR on each vcpu
when resetting the vcpu) moved the init of the HCR register to
happen later in the init of a vcpu, but left out the fixup
done in kvm_reset_vcpu when preparing for a 32bit guest.

As a result, the 32bit guest is run as a 64bit guest, but the
rest of the kernel still manages it as a 32bit. Fun follows.

Moving the fixup to vcpu_reset_hcr solves the problem for good.
