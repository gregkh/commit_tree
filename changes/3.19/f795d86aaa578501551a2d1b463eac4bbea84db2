PCI: Shrink decoding-disabled window while sizing BARs

__pci_read_base() disables decoding while sizing device BARs.  We can't
print while decoding is disabled, which leads to some rather messy exit
logic.

Coalesce the sizing logic to minimize the time decoding is disabled.  This
lets us print errors where they're detected.

The refactoring also takes advantage of the symmetry of obtaining the BAR's
extent (pci_size) and storing the result as the 'region' for both the
32-bit and 64-bit BARs, consolidating both cases.

No functional change intended.
