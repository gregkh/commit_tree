arm: perf: fold percpu_pmu into pmu_hw_events

Currently the percpu_pmu pointers used as percpu_irq dev_id values are
defined separately from the other per-cpu accounting data, which make
dynamically allocating the data (as will be required for systems with
heterogeneous CPUs) difficult.

This patch moves the percpu_pmu pointers into pmu_hw_events (which is
itself allocated per cpu), which will allow for easier dynamic
allocation. Both percpu and regular irqs are requested using percpu_pmu
pointers as tokens, freeing us from having to know whether an irq is
percpu within the handler, and thus avoiding a radix tree lookup on the
handler path.
