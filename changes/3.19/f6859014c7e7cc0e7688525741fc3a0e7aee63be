thermal: cpu_cooling: Store frequencies in descending order

CPUFreq framework *doesn't* guarantee that frequencies present in cpufreq table
will be in ascending or descending order. But cpu_cooling somehow assumes that.

Probably because most of current users are creating this list from DT, which is
done with the help of OPP layer. And OPP layer creates the list in ascending
order of frequencies.

But cpu_cooling can be used for other platforms too, which don't have
frequencies arranged in any order.

This patch tries to fix this issue by creating another list of valid frequencies
in descending order. Care is also taken to throw warnings for duplicate entries.

Later patches would use it to simplify code.
