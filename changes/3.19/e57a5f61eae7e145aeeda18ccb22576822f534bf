mmc: sdhci: Add 64-bit ADMA support

Add 64-bit ADMA support including:
	- add 64-bit ADMA descriptor
	- add SDHCI_USE_64_BIT_DMA flag
	- set upper 32-bits of DMA addresses
	- ability to select 64-bit ADMA
	- ability to use 64-bit ADMA sizes and alignment
	- display "ADMA 64-bit" when host is added

It is assumed that a 64-bit capable device has set a 64-bit DMA mask
and *must* do 64-bit DMA.  A driver has the opportunity to change
that during the first call to ->enable_dma().  Similarly
SDHCI_QUIRK2_BROKEN_64_BIT_DMA must be left to the drivers to
implement.
