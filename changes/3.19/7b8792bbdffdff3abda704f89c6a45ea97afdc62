gpiolib: of: Correct error handling in of_get_named_gpiod_flags

of_get_named_gpiod_flags fails with -EPROBE_DEFER in cases
where the gpio chip is available and the GPIO translation fails.

This causes drivers to be re-probed erroneusly, and hides the
real problem(i.e. the GPIO number being out of range).
