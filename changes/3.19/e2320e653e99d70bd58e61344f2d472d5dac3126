staging: unisys: refactor VISORCHIPSET_SWITCH_INFO

Remove the typedef and use struct visorchipset_switch_info instead. Fix all
CamelCase member names:

switchNo => switch_no
switchTypeGuid => switch_type_uuid
authService1 => authservice1
authService2 => authservice2
authService3 => authservice3
securityContext => security_context
Reserved => reserved
Reserved2 => reserved2
pendingMsgHdr => pending_msg_hdr
