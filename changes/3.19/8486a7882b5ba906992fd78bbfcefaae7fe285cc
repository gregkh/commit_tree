mnt: Move the clear of MNT_LOCKED from copy_tree to it's callers.

Clear MNT_LOCKED in the callers of copy_tree except copy_mnt_ns, and
collect_mounts.  In copy_mnt_ns it is necessary to create an exact
copy of a mount tree, so not clearing MNT_LOCKED is important.
Similarly collect_mounts is used to take a snapshot of the mount tree
for audit logging purposes and auditing using a faithful copy of the
tree is important.

This becomes particularly significant when we start setting MNT_LOCKED
on rootfs to prevent it from being unmounted.
