serial: of-serial: fix up PM ops on no_console_suspend and port type

This patch fixes commit 2dea53bf57783f243c892e99c10c6921e956aa7e,
"serial: of-serial: add PM suspend/resume support", which disables
the uart clock on suspend, but also causes a hardware hang on register
access if no_console_suspend command line option is used.

Also, not every of_serial device is an 8250 port, so the serial8250
suspend/resume functions should only be applied to a real 8250 port.
