staging: comedi: addi_apci_3120: introduce apci3120_ns_to_timer()

The timer divisor calculations in this driver are over complicated.

There are three timers on the board. They all use the same base clock
with a fixed prescaler for each timer. The base clock used depends on
the board version and type:

  APCI-3120 Rev A boards OSC = 14.29MHz base clock (~70ns)
  APCI-3120 Rev B boards OSC = 20MHz base clock (50ns)
  APCI-3001 boards OSC = 20MHz base clock (50ns)

The prescalers for each timer are:

  Timer 0 CLK = OSC/10
  Timer 1 CLK = OSC/1000
  Timer 2 CLK = OSC/1000

Add a new member to the private data, 'osc_base', to hold the base clock
time. Set this member during the board attach.

Introduce a helper function to calculate the divisor needed to generate
a nanosecond time with a given timer.

Use the new helper function in the driver to clarify the code.
