[media] Fix Mygica T230 support

Commit 2adb177e57417cf8409e86bda2c516e5f99a2099 removed 2 devices
from the cxusb device table but failed to fix up the T230 properties
that follow, meaning that this device no longer gets detected properly.
Adjust the cxusb_table index appropriate so detection works.
