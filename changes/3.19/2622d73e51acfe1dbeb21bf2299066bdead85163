pty: Fix packet mode setting race

Because pty_set_pktmode() does not claim the slave's ctrl_lock
to clear ->ctrl_status (to avoid unnecessary lock nesting),
pty_set_pktmode() may accidentally erase new ->ctrl_status updates.
For example,

CPU 0                             | CPU 1
pty_set_pktmode()                 | pty_start()
  spin_lock(master's ctrl_lock)   |
  tty->packet = 1                 |
                                  |   if (tty->link->packet)
                                  |     spin_lock(slave's ctrl_lock)
                                  |     tty->ctrl_status = TIOCPKT_START
  tty->link->ctrl_status = 0      |

Ensure the clear of ->ctrl_status occurs before packet mode is set
(and observable on another cpu).
