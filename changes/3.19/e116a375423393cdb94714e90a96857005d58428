arm64: detect silicon revisions and set cap bits accordingly

After each CPU has been started, we iterate through a list of
CPU features or bugs to detect CPUs which need (or could benefit
from) kernel code patches.
For each feature/bug there is a function which checks if that
particular CPU is affected. We will later provide some more generic
functions for common things like testing for certain MIDR ranges.
We do this for every CPU to cover big.LITTLE systems properly as
well.
If a certain feature/bug has been detected, the capability bit will
be set, so that later the call to apply_alternatives() will trigger
the actual code patching.
