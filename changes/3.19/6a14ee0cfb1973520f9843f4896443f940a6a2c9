ixgbe: Add X550 support function pointers

This patch extends the function pointer structure to include the new
X550 class MAC types. This creates a new file ixgbe_x550.c that contains
all of the new methods.  Because of similarities to the X540 part in
some cases we just use it's methods where they can be used without any
modification.  These exported functions are now defined in the new
ixgbe_x540.h file.
