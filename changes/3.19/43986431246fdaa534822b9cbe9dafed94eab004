ALSA: asihpi: relax firmware version check

Some products firmware is no longer being updated
e.g. dsp5000, dsp8700  but it should continue to work
with updated HPI versions.
Avoid regression by allowing this firmware to be loaded as
long as major version is the same.
Warn about mismatching versions, as matching versions are
preferred.
