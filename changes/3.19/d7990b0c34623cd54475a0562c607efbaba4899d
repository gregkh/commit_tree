cxgb4i/cxgb4 : Refactor macros to conform to uniform standards

Refactored all macros used in cxgb4i as part of previously started cxgb4 macro
names cleanup. Makes them more uniform and avoids namespace collision.
Minor changes in other drivers where required as some of these macros are used
 by multiple drivers, affected drivers are iw_cxgb4, cxgb4(vf) & csiostor
