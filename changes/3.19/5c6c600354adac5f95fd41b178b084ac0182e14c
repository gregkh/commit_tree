drm/i915: Remove DRI1 ring accessors and API

With the deprecation of UMS, and by association DRI1, we have a tough
choice when updating the ring access routines. We either rewrite the
DRI1 routines blindly without testing (so likely to be broken) or take
the liberty of declaring them no longer supported and remove them
entirely. This takes the latter approach.

v2: Also remove the DRI1 sarea updates
