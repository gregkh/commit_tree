x86, mce, severity: Extend the the mce_severity mechanism to handle UCNA/DEFERRED error

Until now, the mce_severity mechanism can only identify the severity
of UCNA error as MCE_KEEP_SEVERITY. Meanwhile, it is not able to filter
out DEFERRED error for AMD platform.

This patch extends the mce_severity mechanism for handling
UCNA/DEFERRED error. In order to do this, the patch introduces a new
severity level - MCE_UCNA/DEFERRED_SEVERITY.

In addition, mce_severity is specific to machine check exception,
and it will check MCIP/EIPV/RIPV bits. In order to use mce_severity
mechanism in non-exception context, the patch also introduces a new
argument (is_excp) for mce_severity. `is_excp' is used to explicitly
specify the calling context of mce_severity.
