ACPI / EC: Fix unexpected ec_remove_handlers() invocations

The ec_remove_handlers() is invoked without checking
EC_FLAGS_HANDLERS_INSTALLED, this patch enhances this check to avoid issues
that acpi_disable_gpe() is invoked unexpectedly to reduce the GPE runtime
count. This may happen when the EC handler installation failed on some
platforms.
