regulator: of: Pass the regulator description in the match table

Drivers can use the of_regulator_match() function to parse the regulator
init_data from DT. A match table is used to specify the name of the node
containing the regulators, the device node and to return the init_data
to the caller.

But also the static regulator descriptor is needed to correctly extract
some DT properties like the regulator initial and suspend modes. Use the
match table to pass that information.
