KVM: x86: Revert NoBigReal patch in the emulator

Commit 10e38fc7cab6 ("KVM: x86: Emulator flag for instruction that only support
16-bit addresses in real mode") introduced NoBigReal for instructions such as
MONITOR. Apparetnly, the Intel SDM description that led to this patch is
misleading.  Since no instruction is using NoBigReal, it is safe to remove it,
we fully understand what the SDM means.
