mlx4: use napi_complete_done()

To enable gro_flush_timeout, a driver has to use napi_complete_done()
instead of napi_complete().

Tested:
 Ran 200 netperf TCP_STREAM from A to B (10Gbe mlx4 link, 8 RX queues)

Without this feature, we send back about 305,000 ACK per second.

GRO aggregation ratio is low (811/305 = 2.65 segments per GRO packet)

Setting a timer of 2000 nsec is enough to increase GRO packet sizes
and reduce number of ACK packets. (811/19.2 = 42)

Receiver performs less calls to upper stacks, less wakes up.
This also reduces cpu usage on the sender, as it receives less ACK
packets.

Note that reducing number of wakes up increases cpu efficiency, but can
decrease QPS, as applications wont have the chance to warmup cpu caches
doing a partial read of RPC requests/answers if they fit in one skb.
