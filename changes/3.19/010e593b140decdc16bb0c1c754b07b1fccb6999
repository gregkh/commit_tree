x86, mpx: Update documentation

I was writing some MPX test programs and realized that the
current design makes it tricky.  I did something like:

	bndcfgu |= bnd_dir | BNDCFGU_ENABLE;
	xrstor();
	printf("xrstor done");
	// #BR bounds exception here
	prctl(MPX_ENABLE_MANAGEMENT);

and then compiled the app with "-fcheck-pointer-bounds -mmpx"
to enable MPX instrumentation.

The problem is that there is MPX instrumentation inserted in
to the area of the printf().  The kernel gets a bounds exception
and since management isn't yet enabled, it SIGSEGV's.

Add a bit to the documentation to explain a way around this and
where apps need to be careful.
