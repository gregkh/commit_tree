Revert "IB/core: Add support for extended query device caps"

While commit 7e36ef8205ff ("IB/core: Temporarily disable
ex_query_device uverb") is correct as it makes the extended
QUERY_DEVICE uverb (which came as part of commit 5a77abf9a97a
("IB/core: Add support for extended query device caps") and commit
860f10a799c8 ("IB/core: Add flags for on demand paging support")) not
available to userspace, it doesn't address the initial issue regarding
ib_copy_to_udata() [1][2].

Additionally, further discussions around this new uverb seems to
conclude it would require a different data structure than the one
currently described in <rdma/ib_user_verbs.h> [3].

Both of these issues require a revert of the changes, so this patch
partially reverts commit 8cdd312cfed7 ("IB/mlx5: Implement the ODP
capability query verb") and commit 860f10a799c8 ("IB/core: Add flags
for on demand paging support") and fully reverts commit 5a77abf9a97a
("IB/core: Add support for extended query device caps").
