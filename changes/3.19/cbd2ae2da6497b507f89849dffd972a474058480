iwlwifi: mvm: disconnect TDLS peers on reconfig

When TDLS peers are present the FW will send packets on a dedicated
TID vs. the peer when performing TDLS channel-switches. The driver
configures the TID on connection to the peer and the FW is responsible
for maintaining the state of QoS seqno and PN/IV for encryption.

If the FW asserts, the driver cannot correctly reconfigure the starting
seqno/PN to the reloaded FW, thus forcing us to reconnect the peer.
