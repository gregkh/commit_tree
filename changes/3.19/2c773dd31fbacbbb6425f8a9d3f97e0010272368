x86: Convert a few more per-CPU items to read-mostly ones

Both this_cpu_off and cpu_info aren't getting modified post boot, yet
are being accessed on enough code paths that grouping them with other
frequently read items seems desirable. For cpu_info this at the same
time implies removing the cache line alignment (which afaict became
pointless when it got converted to per-CPU data years ago).
