Staging: android: Replace timeval with ktime_t in timed_gpio.c

'struct timeval t' is used to return remaining time in milliseconds.

32-bit systems using 'struct timeval' will break in the year 2038,
so we have to replace that code with more appropriate types.
This patch changes the android driver to use ktime_t.
