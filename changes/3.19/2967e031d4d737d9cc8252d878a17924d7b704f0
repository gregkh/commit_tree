mac80211: copy chandef from AP vif to VLANs

Instead of keeping track of all those special cases where
VLAN interfaces have no bss_conf.chandef, just make sure
they have the same as the AP interface they belong to.

Among others, this fixes a crash getting a VLAN's channel
from userspace since a NULL channel is returned as a good
result (return value 0) for VLANs since the commit below.
