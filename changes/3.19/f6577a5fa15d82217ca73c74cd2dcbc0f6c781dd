x86, kvm, vmx: Always use LOAD_IA32_EFER if available

At least on Sandy Bridge, letting the CPU switch IA32_EFER is much
faster than switching it manually.

I benchmarked this using the vmexit kvm-unit-test (single run, but
GOAL multiplied by 5 to do more iterations):

I haven't explicitly computed the significance of these numbers,
but this isn't subtle.

[The results were reproducible on all of Nehalem, Sandy Bridge and
 Ivy Bridge.  The slowness of manual switching is because writing
 to EFER with WRMSR triggers a TLB flush, even if the only bit you're
 touching is SCE (so the page table format is not affected).  Doing
 the write as part of vmentry/vmexit, instead, does not flush the TLB,
 probably because all processors that have EPT also have VPID. - Paolo]
