atari_NCR5380: Introduce FLAG_TAGGED_QUEUING

The static variable setup_use_tagged_queuing is declared in mac_scsi.c,
sun3_scsi.c and atari_scsi.c and doesn't belong in the core driver.
None of the other NCR5380 drivers suffer from this layering issue which
makes merging the core drivers more difficult and will likely hinder plans
for future use of platform data to configure the driver.

Replace the static variable with a host flag. This way it can be reported
along with the other flags.
