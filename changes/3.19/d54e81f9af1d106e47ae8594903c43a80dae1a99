arm64: entry: avoid writing lr explicitly for constructing return paths

Using an explicit adr instruction to set the link register to point at
ret_fast_syscall/ret_to_user can defeat branch and return stack predictors.

Instead, use the standard calling instructions (bl, blr) and have an
unconditional branch as the following instruction.
