userns: Allow setting gid_maps without privilege when setgroups is disabled

Now that setgroups can be disabled and not reenabled, setting gid_map
without privielge can now be enabled when setgroups is disabled.

This restores most of the functionality that was lost when unprivileged
setting of gid_map was removed.  Applications that use this functionality
will need to check to see if they use setgroups or init_groups, and if they
don't they can be fixed by simply disabling setgroups before writing to
gid_map.
