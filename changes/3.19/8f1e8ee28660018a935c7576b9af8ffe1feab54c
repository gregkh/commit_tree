ARM: mvebu: completely disable hardware I/O coherency

The current hardware I/O coherency is known to cause problems with DMA
coherent buffers, as it still requires explicit I/O synchronization
barriers, which is not compatible with the semantics expected by the
Linux DMA coherent buffers API.

So, in order to have enough time to validate a new solution based on
automatic I/O synchronization barriers, this commit disables hardware
I/O coherency entirely. Future patches will re-enable it.
