ASoC: Rename snd_soc_dai_driver struct ac97_control field to bus_control

Setting the ac97_control field on a CPU DAI tells the ASoC core that this
DAI in addition to audio data also transports control data to the CODEC.
This causes the core to suspend the DAI after the CODEC and resume it before
the CODEC so communication to the CODEC is still possible. This is not
necessarily something that is specific to AC'97 and can be used by other
buses with the same requirement. This patch renames the flag from
ac97_control to bus_control to make this explicit.

While we are at it also change the type from int to bool.

The following semantich patch was used for automatic conversion of the
drivers:
// <smpl>
@@
identifier drv;
@@
struct snd_soc_dai_driver drv = {
-	.ac97_control
+	.bus_control
	=
-	1
+	true
};
// </smpl>
