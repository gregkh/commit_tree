[media] vivid-tpg-colors: add AdobeRGB and BT.2020 support

This extends the precalculated tpg_csc_colors matrix with AdobeRGB and BT.2020
colorspace support.

It also adds two precalculated tables that convert between linear RGB and non-linear
Rec.709 R'G'B' values, i.e. the Rec. 709 transfer function. This is needed to
efficiently handle the BT.2020 Constant Luminance Yc'CbcCrc encoding and decoding.
