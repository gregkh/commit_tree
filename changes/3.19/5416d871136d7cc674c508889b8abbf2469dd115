drm/i915/skl: Set the eDP link rate on DPLL0

On SKL DPLL0 is used to derive CDCLK but can also be used to drive an
eDP port (as long as we don't want SSC). DPLL0 is special enough to not
be handled by the shared DPLL framework (drives CDCLK, not supposed to
enable the HDMI mode), So we need to compute the configuration
separately from the other DPLLs.

Note that we don't need to reprogram DPLL0 (which would mean bringing
down CDCLK) to support the various eDP 1.3 link rates as they all share
the same VCO (8100).
