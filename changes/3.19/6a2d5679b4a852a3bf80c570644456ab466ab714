oom: kill the insufficient and no longer needed PT_TRACE_EXIT check

After the previous patch we can remove the PT_TRACE_EXIT check in
oom_scan_process_thread(), it was added to handle the case when the
coredumping was "frozen" by ptrace, but it doesn't really work.  If
nothing else, we would need to check all threads which could share the
same ->mm to make it more or less correct.
