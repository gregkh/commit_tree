rhashtable: Add parent argument to mutex_is_held

Currently mutex_is_held can only test locks in the that are global
since it takes no arguments.  This prevents rhashtable from being
used in places where locks are lock, e.g., per-namespace locks.

This patch adds a parent field to mutex_is_held and rhashtable_params
so that local locks can be used (and tested).
