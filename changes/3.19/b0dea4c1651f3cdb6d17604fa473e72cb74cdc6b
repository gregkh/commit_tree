ext4: move handling of list of shrinkable inodes into extent status code

Currently callers adding extents to extent status tree were responsible
for adding the inode to the list of inodes with freeable extents. This
is error prone and puts list handling in unnecessarily many places.

Just add inode to the list automatically when the first non-delay extent
is added to the tree and remove inode from the list when the last
non-delay extent is removed.
