i40e: rework debug messages for NVM update

Rework the debug messages in the NVM update state machine so that we can
turn them on and off dynamically rather than forcing a recompile/reload.

These can now be turned on with something like:
	ethtool -s eth1 msglvl 0xf000008f
and off with:
	ethtool -s eth1 msglvl 0xf000000f

The high 0xf0000000 gets the driver's attention that we want to change the
internal debug flags, and the 0x80 bit is the NVM debug.
