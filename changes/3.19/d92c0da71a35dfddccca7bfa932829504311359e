IB/srp: Add multichannel support

Improve performance by using multiple RDMA/RC channels per SCSI
host for communication with an SRP target. About the
implementation:
- Introduce a loop over all channels in the code that uses
  target->ch.
- Set the SRP_MULTICHAN_MULTI flag during login for the creation
  of the second and subsequent channels.
- RDMA completion vectors are chosen such that RDMA completion
  interrupts are handled by the CPU socket that submitted the I/O
  request. As one can see in this patch it has been assumed if a
  system contains n CPU sockets and m RDMA completion vectors
  have been assigned to an RDMA HCA that IRQ affinity has been
  configured such that completion vectors [i*m/n..(i+1)*m/n) are
  bound to CPU socket i with 0 <= i < n.
- Modify srp_free_ch_ib() and srp_free_req_data() such that it
  becomes safe to invoke these functions after the corresponding
  allocation function failed.
- Add a ch_count sysfs attribute per target port.
