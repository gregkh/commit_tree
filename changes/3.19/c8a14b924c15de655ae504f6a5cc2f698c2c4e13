staging: comedi: adv_pci1723: use comedi_subdevice readback for 'ao_data'

Use the comedi_subdevice 'readback' member and the core provided (*insn_read)
to handle the readback of the write-only analog output subdevice. Remove the
then unused 'ao_data' member from the private data.

The private data is now unnecessary. Remove it and the allocation.

For aesthetics, rename the (*insn_write) function and tidy it up a bit.
