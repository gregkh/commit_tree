btrfs: Fix the bug that fs_info->pending_changes is never cleared.

Fs_info->pending_changes is never cleared since the original code uses
cmpxchg(&fs_info->pending_changes, 0, 0), which will only clear it if
pending_changes is already 0.

This will cause a lot of problem when mount it with inode_cache mount
option.
If the btrfs is mounted as inode_cache, pending_changes will always be
1, even when the fs is frozen.
