sched/deadline: Fix artificial overrun introduced by yield_task_dl()

The yield semantic of deadline class is to reduce remaining runtime to
zero, and then update_curr_dl() will stop it. However, comsumed bandwidth
is reduced from the budget of yield task again even if it has already been
set to zero which leads to artificial overrun. This patch fix it by make
sure we don't steal some more time from the task that yielded in update_curr_dl().
