staging: unisys: refactor ultra_segment_state

Rename the struct to spar_segment_state and fix CamelCase names:

Enabled => enabled
Active => active
Alive => alive
Revoked => revoked
Allocated => allocated
Known => known
Ready => ready
Operating => operating

Fix all references to modified names to use the new names.
