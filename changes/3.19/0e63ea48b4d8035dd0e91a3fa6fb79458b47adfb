arm64/efi: add missing call to early_ioremap_reset()

The early ioremap support introduced by patch bf4b558eba92
("arm64: add early_ioremap support") failed to add a call to
early_ioremap_reset() at an appropriate time. Without this call,
invocations of early_ioremap etc. that are done too late will go
unnoticed and may cause corruption.

This is exactly what happened when the first user of this feature
was added in patch f84d02755f5a ("arm64: add EFI runtime services").
The early mapping of the EFI memory map is unmapped during an early
initcall, at which time the early ioremap support is long gone.

Fix by adding the missing call to early_ioremap_reset() to
setup_arch(), and move the offending early_memunmap() to right after
the point where the early mapping of the EFI memory map is last used.
