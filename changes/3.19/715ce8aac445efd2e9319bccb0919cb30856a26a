staging: comedi: addi_apci_035: remove boardinfo

The hardware has an eeprom but the boardinfo properly defines the subdevice
support so reading the eeprom and setting the 's_EeParameters' use is not
necessary. Since the boardinfo only has one entry its not really necessary.
Also, providing a subdevice the read the eeprom is not really interesting.

Remove the eeprom support code along with the boardinfo and initialize the
subdevices directly.
