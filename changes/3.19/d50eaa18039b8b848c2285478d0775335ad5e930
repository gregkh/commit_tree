KVM: x86: Perform limit checks when assigning EIP

If branch (e.g., jmp, ret) causes limit violations, since the target IP >
limit, the #GP exception occurs before the branch.  In other words, the RIP
pushed on the stack should be that of the branch and not that of the target.

To do so, we can call __linearize, with new EIP, which also saves us the code
which performs the canonical address checks. On the case of assigning an EIP >=
2^32 (when switching cs.l), we also safe, as __linearize will check the new EIP
does not exceed the limit and would trigger #GP(0) otherwise.
