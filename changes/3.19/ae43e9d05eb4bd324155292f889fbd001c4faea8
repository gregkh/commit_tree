rbd: fix rbd_dev_parent_get() when parent_overlap == 0

The comment for rbd_dev_parent_get() said

    * We must get the reference before checking for the overlap to
    * coordinate properly with zeroing the parent overlap in
    * rbd_dev_v2_parent_info() when an image gets flattened.  We
    * drop it again if there is no overlap.

but the "drop it again if there is no overlap" part was missing from
the implementation.  This lead to absurd parent_ref values for images
with parent_overlap == 0, as parent_ref was incremented for each
img_request and virtually never decremented.

Fix this by leveraging the fact that refresh path calls
rbd_dev_v2_parent_info() under header_rwsem and use it for read in
rbd_dev_parent_get(), instead of messing around with atomics.  Get rid
of barriers in rbd_dev_v2_parent_info() while at it - I don't see what
they'd pair with now and I suspect we are in a pretty miserable
situation as far as proper locking goes regardless.
