[media] V4L2: fix VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS 32-bit compatibility mode data copy-back

Similar to an earlier patch, fixing reading user-space data for the
VIDIOC_CREATE_BUFS ioctl() in 32-bit compatibility mode, this patch fixes
writing back of the possibly modified struct to the user. However, unlike
the former bug, this one is much less harmful, because it only results in
the kernel failing to write the .type field back to the user, but in fact
this is likely unneeded, because the kernel will hardly want to change
that field. Therefore this bug is more of a theoretical nature.
