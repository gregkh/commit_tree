rtlwifi: Fix error when accessing unmapped memory in skb

These drivers use 9100-byte receive buffers, thus allocating an skb requires
an O(3) memory allocation. Under heavy memory loads and fragmentation, such
a request can fail. Previous versions of the driver have dropped the packet
and reused the old buffer; however, the new version introduced a bug in that
it released the old buffer before trying to allocate a new one. The previous
method is implemented here. The skb is unmapped before any attempt is made to
allocate another.
