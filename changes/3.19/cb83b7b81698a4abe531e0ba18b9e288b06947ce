Btrfs: make get_caching_control unconditionally return the ctl

This was written when we didn't do a caching control for the fast free space
cache loading.  However we started doing that a long time ago, and there is
still a small window of time that we could be caching the block group the fast
way, so if there is a caching_ctl at all on the block group just return it, the
callers all wait properly for what they want.  Thanks,
