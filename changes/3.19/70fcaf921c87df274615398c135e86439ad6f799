ARM: dts: dra7-evm: Update SMPS7 (VDD_CORE) max voltage to match DM

As per the latest Data Manual, for newer samples,
the nominal voltage required for VDD_CORE at OPP_NOM can be
upto 1.06V which was 1.03V earlier.

Update the regulator max voltage constraint for SMPS7,
connected to VDD_CORE, to meet this requirement.
