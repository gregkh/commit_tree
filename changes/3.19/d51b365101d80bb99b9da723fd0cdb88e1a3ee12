staging: comedi: comedidev.h: remove some #ifdefs

Some declarations and macro definitions in "comedidev.h" are protected
by various `#ifdef`s for kernel configuration options, but the header
file compiles fine without the `#ifdef`s regardless of whether those
config option macros are defined or not.  Remove the `#ifdef`s and
compile the affected code unconditionally.
