microblaze: Fix mmap for cache coherent memory

When running in non-cache coherent configuration the memory that was
allocated with dma_alloc_coherent() has a custom mapping and so there is no
1-to-1 relationship between the kernel virtual address and the PFN. This
means that virt_to_pfn() will not work correctly for those addresses and the
default mmap implementation in the form of dma_common_mmap() will map some
random, but not the requested, memory area.

Fix this by providing a custom mmap implementation that looks up the PFN
from the page table rather than using virt_to_pfn.
