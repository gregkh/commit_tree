vfs: cleanup show_mountinfo

Starting with commit v3.2-rc4-1-g02125a8, seq_path_root() no longer
changes the value of its "struct path *root" argument.
Starting with commit v3.2-rc7-104-g8c9379e, the "struct path *root"
argument of seq_path_root() is const.
As result, the temporary variable "root" in show_mountinfo() that
holds a copy of struct path root is no longer needed.
