perf/rapl: Fix sysfs_show() initialization for RAPL PMU

This patch fixes a problem with the initialization of the
sysfs_show() routine for the RAPL PMU.

The current code was wrongly relying on the EVENT_ATTR_STR()
macro which uses the events_sysfs_show() function in the x86
PMU code. That function itself was relying on the x86_pmu data
structure. Yet RAPL and the core PMU (x86_pmu) have nothing to
do with each other. They should therefore not interact with
each other.

The x86_pmu structure is initialized at boot time based on
the host CPU model. When the host CPU is not supported, the
x86_pmu remains uninitialized and some of the callbacks it
contains are NULL.

The false dependency with x86_pmu could potentially cause crashes
in case the x86_pmu is not initialized while the RAPL PMU is. This
may, for instance, be the case in virtualized environments.

This patch fixes the problem by using a private sysfs_show()
routine for exporting the RAPL PMU events.
