IB/srp: Fix a race condition triggered by destroying a queue pair

At least LID reassignment can trigger a race condition in the SRP
initiator driver, namely the receive completion handler trying to
post a request on a QP during or after QP destruction and before
the CQ's have been destroyed. Avoid this race by modifying a QP
into the error state and by waiting until all receive completions
have been processed before destroying a QP.
