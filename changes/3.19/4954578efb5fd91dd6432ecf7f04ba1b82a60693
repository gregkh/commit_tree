[media] m88ts2022: return the err code in its probe function when error occurs

if "chip_id" is wrong or "dev->cfg.clock_out" is invalid, the i2c model is still loaded.
It will cause "kernel NULL pointer dereference" oops when the i2c model remove.
returning the err code will prevent the i2c model load.
