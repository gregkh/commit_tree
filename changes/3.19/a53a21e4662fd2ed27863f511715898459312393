atari_NCR5380: Move static co-routine variables to host data

Unlike NCR5380.c, the atari_NCR5380.c core driver is limited to a single
instance because co-routine state is stored globally.

Fix this by removing the static scsi host pointer. For the co-routine,
obtain this pointer from the work_struct pointer instead. For the interrupt
handler, obtain it from the dev_id argument.
