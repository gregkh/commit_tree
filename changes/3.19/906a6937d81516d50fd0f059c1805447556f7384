i40evf: make early init sequence even more robust

When multiple VFs attempt to initialize simultaneously, the firmware may
delay or drop messages. Make the init code more adept at handling these
situations by a) reinitializing the admin queue if the firmware fails to
process a request, and b) resending a request if the PF doesn't answer.

Once the request has been sent again, the PF might end up getting both
requests and send the configuration information to the driver twice.
This will cause the VF to complain about receiving an unexpected message
from the PF. Since this is not fatal, reduce the warning level of the
log messages that are generated in response to this event.
