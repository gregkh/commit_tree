ASoC: wm5102: Move ultrasonic response settings lock to the driver level

The wm5102 driver currently uses the snd_soc_codec mutex to protect its
ultrasonic response settings from concurrent access. This patch moves this
lock to the driver level. This will allow us to eventually remove the
snd_soc_codec mutex.
