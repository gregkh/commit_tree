mtd: atmel_nand: replace memcpy32_toio/memcpy32_fromio with memcpy

There is no need to use memcpy32_toio/memcpy32_fromio to transfer data
between memory and NFC sram. As the NFC sram is a also a memory space
not an I/O space, we can just use memcpy().

We remove the __iomem prefix for NFC sram to avoid sparse warnings.
