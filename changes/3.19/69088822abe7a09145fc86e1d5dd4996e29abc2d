sunvnet: NAPIfy sunvnet

Move Rx packet procssing to the NAPI poll callback.
Disable VIO interrupt and unconditioanlly go into NAPI
context from vnet_event.

Note that we want to minimize the number of LDC
STOP/START messages sent. Specifically, do not send a STOP
message if vnet_walk_rx does not read all the available descriptors
because of the NAPI budget limitation. Instead, note the end index
as part of port state, and resume from this index when the
next poll callback is triggered.
