arm64: mm: dump: fix shift warning

When building with 48-bit VAs, it's possible to get the following
warning when building the arm64 page table dumping code:

arch/arm64/mm/dump.c: In function ‘walk_pgd’:
arch/arm64/mm/dump.c:266:2: warning: right shift count >= width of type
  pgd_t *pgd = pgd_offset(mm, 0);
  ^

As pgd_offset is a macro and the second argument is not cast to any
particular type, the zero will be given integer type by the compiler.
As pgd_offset passes the pargument to pgd_index, we then try to shift
the 32-bit integer by at least 39 bits (for 4k pages).

Elsewhere the pgd_offset is passed a second argument of unsigned long
type, so let's do the same here by passing '0UL' rather than '0'.
