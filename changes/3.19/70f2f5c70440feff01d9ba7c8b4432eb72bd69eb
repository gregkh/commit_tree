drm/i915: Report the actual swizzling back to userspace

Userspace cares about whether or not swizzling depends on the page
address for its direct access into bound objects. Extend the get_tiling
ioctl to report the physical swizzling value in addition to the logical
swizzling value so that userspace can accurately determine when it is
possible for manual detiling.
