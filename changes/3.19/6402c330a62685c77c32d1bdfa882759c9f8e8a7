drm/i915: Fix null pointer dereference in ring cleanup code

If a ring failed to initialise for any reason then the error path would try to
clean up all rings including those that had not yet been allocated. The ring
clean up code did a check that the ring was valid before starting its work.
Unfortunately, that was after it had already dereferenced the ring to obtain a
dev_private pointer.
