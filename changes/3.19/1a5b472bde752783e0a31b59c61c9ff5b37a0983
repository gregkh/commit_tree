Security: smack: replace kzalloc with kmem_cache for inode_smack

The patch use kmem_cache to allocate/free inode_smack since they are
alloced in high volumes making it a perfect case for kmem_cache.

As per analysis, 24 bytes of memory is wasted per allocation due
to internal fragmentation. With kmem_cache, this can be avoided.

Accounting of memory allocation is below :
 total       slack            net      count-alloc/free        caller
Before (with kzalloc)
1919872      719952          1919872      29998/0          new_inode_smack+0x14

After (with kmem_cache)
1201680          0           1201680      30042/0          new_inode_smack+0x18

>From above data, we found that 719952 bytes(~700 KB) of memory is
saved on allocation of 29998 smack inodes.
