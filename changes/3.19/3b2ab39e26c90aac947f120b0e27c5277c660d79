Bluetooth: Fix L2CAP socket lock nesting level

The teardown callback for L2CAP channels is problematic in that it is
explicitly called for all types of channels from l2cap_chan_del(),
meaning it's not possible to hard-code a nesting level when taking the
socket lock. The simplest way to have a correct nesting level for the
socket locking is to use the same value as for the chan. This also means
that the other places trying to lock parent sockets need to be update to
use the chan value (since L2CAP_NESTING_PARENT is defined as 2 whereas
SINGLE_DEPTH_NESTING has the value 1).
