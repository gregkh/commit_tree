ath10k: fix pm resume after suspend

Firmware was crashing when we were trying to warm reset it
after suspend. This was due to the fact that target registeres
can be accessed only if the hardware is awaken.

This patch makes sure to awake the device also on the hif up,
not only in case of probe call.
