staging: lustre: ldlm: Fix warning about missing spaces

checkpatch.pl complains about a number of places where spaces were
missing. This patch fixes all of these errors.

For better readability, the warning of hitting the 80 character per
line limit in line 1349 introduced by this change is ignored
deliberately.
