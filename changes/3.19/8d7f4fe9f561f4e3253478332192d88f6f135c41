drm/i915: Make sure PSR is ready for been re-enabled.

Let's make sure PSR is propperly disabled before to re-enabled it.

According to Spec, after disabled PSR CTL, the Idle state might occur
up to 24ms, that is one full frame time (1/refresh rate),
plus SRD exit training time (max of 6ms),
plus SRD aux channel handshake (max of 1.5ms).

So if something went wrong PSR will be disabled until next full
enable/disable setup.

v2: The 24ms above takes in account 16ms for refresh rate on 60Hz mode. However
on low frequency modes this can take longer. So let's use 50ms for safeness.

v3: Move wait out of psr.lock critical area.
