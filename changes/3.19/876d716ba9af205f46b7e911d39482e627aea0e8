pinctrl: rockchip: Set wake_enabled

The rockchip pinctrl driver uses irq_gc_set_wake() but doesn't setup
the .wake_enabled member.  That means that we can never actually use a
pin for wakeup.  When "irq_set_irq_wake()" tries to call through it
will always get a failure from set_irq_wake_real() and will then set
wake_depth to 0.  Assuming you can resume you'll later get an error
message about "Unbalanced IRQ x wake disable".
