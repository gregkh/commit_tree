Documentation: describe trace_buf_size parameter more accurately

I'm stuck into panic that too litte free memory is left when I boot with
trace_buf_size parameter. After digging into the problem, I found that
trace_buf_size is the size of trace buffer on each cpu rather than total
size of trace buffer. To prevent victim like me, change description of
trace_buf_size parameter more accurately.
