serial: fsl_lpuart: Remove unneeded registration message

There is no real value in displaying "serial: Freescale lpuart driver" in every
boot.

The uart_register_driver() can fail and even so the "serial: Freescale lpuart
driver" will be displayed, which is not really helpful.

This is particularly annoying when booting multi_v7_defconfig kernel on a SoC
that is not a Vybrid/Layerscape and even though this message gets displayed.
