net/mlx4_en: Remove RX buffers alignment to IP_ALIGN

When IP_ALIGN has a non zero value, hardware will write to a non aligned
address. The only reader from this address is when copying the header
from the first frag into the linear buffer (further access to the IP
address will be from the linear buffer, in which the headers are
aligned). Since the penalty of non align access by the hardware is
greater than the software memcpy, changing the frag_align to always be 0.
