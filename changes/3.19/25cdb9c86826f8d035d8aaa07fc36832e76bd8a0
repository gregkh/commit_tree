x86/microcode/intel: Fish out the stashed microcode for the BSP

I'm such a moron! The simple solution of saving the BSP patch
for use on resume was too simple (and wrong!), hint:
sizeof(struct microcode_intel).

What needs to be done instead is to fish out the microcode patch
we have stashed previously and apply that on the BSP in case the
late loader hasn't been utilized.

So do that instead.
