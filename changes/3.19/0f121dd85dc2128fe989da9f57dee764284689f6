scsi: don't use scsi_next_command in scsi_reset_provider

scsi_reset_provider already manually runs all queues for the given host,
so it doesn't need the scsi_run_queues call from it, and it doesn't need
a reference on the device because it's synchronous.

So let's just call scsi_put_command directly and avoid the device reference
dance to simplify the code.
