PM / Hibernate: Migrate to ktime_t

This patch migrates swsusp_show_speed and its callers to using ktime_t instead
of 'struct timeval' which suffers from the y2038 problem.

Changes to swsusp_show_speed:
        - use ktime_t for start and stop times
        - pass start and stop times by value
Calling functions affected:
        - load_image
        - load_image_lzo
        - save_image
        - save_image_lzo
        - hibernate_preallocate_memory
Design decisions:
        - use ktime_t to preserve same granularity of reporting as before
        - use centisecs logic as before to avoid 'div by zero' issues caused by
          using seconds and nanoseconds directly
        - use monotonic time (ktime_get()) since we only care about elapsed time.
