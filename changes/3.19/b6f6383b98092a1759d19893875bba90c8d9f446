Revert "ARM: shmobile: multiplatform: add Audo DMAC peri peri support on defconfig"

This reverts commit 2315f9fce4da7df9362e4baeb5250d14ea48bf63.

Unfortunately enabling RCAR_AUDMAC_PP support this patch breaks dmaengine
support on R-Car Gen2 boards. This should be resolved by driver updates
in v3.20. But v3.19 was too early for this defconfig change.
