bpf: fix arraymap NULL deref and missing overflow and zero size checks

- fix NULL pointer dereference:
kernel/bpf/arraymap.c:41 array_map_alloc() error: potential null dereference 'array'.  (kzalloc returns null)
kernel/bpf/arraymap.c:41 array_map_alloc() error: we previously assumed 'array' could be null (see line 40)

- integer overflow check was missing in arraymap
(hashmap checks for overflow via kmalloc_array())

- arraymap can round_up(value_size, 8) to zero. check was missing.

- hashmap was missing zero size check as well, since roundup_pow_of_two() can
truncate into zero

- found a typo in the arraymap comment and unnecessary empty line

Fix all of these issues and make both overflow checks explicit U32 in size.
