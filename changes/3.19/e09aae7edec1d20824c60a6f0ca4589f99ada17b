blk-mq: release mq's kobjects in blk_release_queue()

The kobject memory inside blk-mq hctx/ctx shouldn't have been freed
before the kobject is released because driver core can access it freely
before its release.

We can't do that in all ctx/hctx/mq_kobj's release handler because
it can be run before blk_cleanup_queue().

Given mq_kobj shouldn't have been introduced, this patch simply moves
mq's release into blk_release_queue().
