ASoC: add TI ts3a227e headset chip driver

The TS3A227E is an autonomous audio accessory detection and
configuration switch that detects 3-pole or 4-pole audio accessories
and configures internal switches to route the signals accordingly.

This chip also has built-in support for the new button standard
described in the Android "Wired audio headset specification" v1.0.
These buttons will be reported on the jack as buttons 0-3 mapped to
KEY_MEDIA, KEY_VOLUMEUP, KEY_VOLUMEDOWN, and KEY_VOICE_COMMAND.

This will be added as an aux_dev and have the jack passed in from the
machine driver.
