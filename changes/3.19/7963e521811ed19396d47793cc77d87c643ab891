NVMe: Passthrough IOCTL for IO commands

The NVME_IOCTL_SUBMIT_IO only works for IO commands with block data
transfers and isn't usable for other NVMe commands like flush,
data set management, or any sort of vendor unique command. The
NVME_IOCTL_ADMIN_CMD, however, can easily be modified to accept arbitrary
IO commands in addition to arbitrary admin commands without breaking
backward compatibility. This patch just adds a new IOCTL to distinguish
if the driver should submit the command on an IO or Admin queue.
