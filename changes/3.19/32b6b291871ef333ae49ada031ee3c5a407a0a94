staging: unisys: Fix ULTRA_VBUS_DEVICEINFO

Remove the typedef from ULTRA_VBUS_DEVICEINFO and use struct
ultra_vbus_deviceinfo instead. Fix CamelCase member names:

devType => devtype
drvName => drvname
infoStrings => infostrs

Fix indentation on function definitions that were affected by the
structure's name change.
