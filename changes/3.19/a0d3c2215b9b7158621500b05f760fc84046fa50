arm: mvebu: fix vendor prefix typo in kirkwood-synology.dtsi

As reported by Andrew, the vendor prefix for Seiko Instruments, Inc.
S-35390A I2C RTC chip in kirkwood-synology.dtsi has a typo (ssi
instead of sii). This patches fixes it.

Note: i2c devices ignore the optional vendor prefix, which explains
why it worked with the typo and also why there is no backward
compatibility issues with the fix.
