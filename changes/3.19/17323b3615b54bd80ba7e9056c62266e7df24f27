ARM: shmobile: koelsch dts: Add chosen/stdout-path

Add a stdout-path property so that automatic console selection works
in the absence of a "console=" parameter on the kernel command line.

Note that we have to keep the "console=" parameter in chosen/bootargs,
as this DTS is shared between legacy and multi-platform.
