kvm: memslots: replace heap sort with an insertion sort pass

memslots is a sorted array.  When a slot is changed, heapsort (lib/sort.c)
would take O(n log n) time to update it; an optimized insertion sort will
only cost O(n) on an array with just one item out of order.

Replace sort() with a custom sort that takes advantage of memslots usage
pattern and the known position of the changed slot.

performance change of 128 memslots insertions with gradually increasing
size (the worst case):

      heap sort   custom sort
max:  249747      2500 cycles

with custom sort alg taking ~98% less then original
update time.
