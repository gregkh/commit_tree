drm/i915/eDP: When enabling panel VDD cancel pending disable worker

Before testing if the panel VDD is enabled on eDP cancel any pending
disable worker. This makes sure the worker will be triggered with a
delay from the last time edp_panel_vdd_schedule_off() is called, not
the first time. This avoids unnecessary overhead.

v2: use cancel_delayed_work() instead of cancel_delayed_work_sync()
as the pps_mutexes will provide the required serialization with
edp_panel_vdd_work() while the sync variant may deadlock. Suggested
by Ville Syrjälä <ville.syrjala@linux.intel.com>.
Made commit message a bit clearer.
