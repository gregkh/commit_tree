intel_pstate: Add support for HWP

Add support of Hardware Managed Performance States (HWP) described in Volume 3
section 14.4 of the SDM.

With HWP enbaled intel_pstate will no longer be responsible for selecting P
states for the processor. intel_pstate will continue to register to
the cpufreq core as the scaling driver for CPUs implementing
HWP. In HWP mode intel_pstate provides three functions reporting
frequency to the cpufreq core, support for the set_policy() interface
from the core and maintaining the intel_pstate sysfs interface in
/sys/devices/system/cpu/intel_pstate.  User preferences expressed via
the set_policy() interface or the sysfs interface are forwared to the
CPU via the HWP MSR interface.
