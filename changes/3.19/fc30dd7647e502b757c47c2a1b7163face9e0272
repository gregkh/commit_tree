[media] em28xx: Add support for Terratec Cinergy T2 Stick HD

Terratec Cinergy T2 Stick HD [eb1a:8179] is a USB DVB-T/T2/C tuner that
contains following components:

* Empia EM28178 USB bridge
* Silicon Labs Si2168-A30 demodulator
* Silicon Labs Si2146-A10 tuner

I don't have the remote, so the RC_MAP is a best guess based on the pictures of
the remote controllers and other supported Terratec devices with a similar
remote.
