NFC: NCI: Handle Target mode activation

Changes:

 * Extract the Listen mode activation parameters from RF_INTF_ACTIVATED_NTF.

 * Store the General Bytes of ATR_REQ.

 * Signal that Target mode is activated in case of an activation in NFC-DEP.

 * Update the NCI state accordingly.

 * Use the various constants defined in nfc.h.

 * Fix the ATR_REQ and ATR_RES maximum size. As per NCI 1.0 and NCI 1.1, the
   Activation Parameters for both Poll and Listen mode contain all the bytes of
   ATR_REQ/ATR_RES starting and including Byte 3 as defined in [DIGITAL].
   In [DIGITAL], the maximum size of ATR_REQ/ATR_RES is 64 bytes and they are
   numbered starting from Byte 1.
