libsas: remove task_collector mode

The task_collector mode (or "latency_injector", (C) Dan Willians) is an
optional I/O path in libsas that queues up scsi commands instead of
directly sending it to the hardware.  It generall increases latencies
to in the optiomal case slightly reduce mmio traffic to the hardware.

Only the obsolete aic94xx driver and the mvsas driver allowed to use
it without recompiling the kernel, and most drivers didn't support it
at all.

Remove the giant blob of code to allow better optimizations for scsi-mq
in the future.
