ARM: at91: remove useless init_time for DT-only SoCs

Commits bcf8c7e7703bb2bbde66bec26a81fed4be9cd1d4 and
4bf7753b8ab7c704ca864b1653367ea9cfe68a25 introduced compilation errors
("error: 'NR_IRQS_LEGACY' undeclared (first use in this function)") because
they remove the asm/irq.h inclusion while the init_time function needs it
for the NR_IRQS_LEGACY definition.

In the other hand, the point of these commits is to remove board file
support, and init_time is only needed when booting non-DT boards, we can
thus safely remove init_time functions.
