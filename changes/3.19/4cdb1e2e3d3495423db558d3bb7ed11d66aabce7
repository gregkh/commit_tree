net: shrink struct softnet_data

flow_limit in struct softnet_data is only read from local cpu
and can be moved to fill a hole, reducing softnet_data size by
64 bytes on x86_64

While we are at it, move output_queue, output_queue_tailp and
completion_queue, so that rx / tx paths touch a single cache line.
