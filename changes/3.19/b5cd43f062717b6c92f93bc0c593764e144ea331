mmc: omap_hsmmc: Remove unnecessary callbacks from platform data

These callbacks are set during driver probe and not from the platform
init, -- evtl. they had been for oamp 1/2 -- for omap3 they are local
functions of the driver. These indirection could be dropped
altogether in favor of regular function calls TODO
