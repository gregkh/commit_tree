drivers/rtc/rtc-snvs: fix suspend/resume

The alarm interrupt handler also reads registers which are part of SNVS
and need clocks enabled.  However, the resume function is called after
IRQ's have been enabled, hence this leads to a abort:

    Unhandled fault: external abort on non-linefetch (0x1008) at 0x908c604c
    Internal error: : 1008 [#1] ARM

    PC is at snvs_rtc_irq_handler+0x14/0x74
    LR is at handle_irq_event_percpu+0x3c/0x144

Fix this by using the .{suspend/resume}_noirq callbacks instead of
.{suspend/resume} .
