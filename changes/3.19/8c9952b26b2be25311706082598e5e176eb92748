HID: logitech-hidpp: fix negated returns

Reported by Dan Carpenter:

drivers/hid/hid-logitech-hidpp.c:359 hidpp_root_get_protocol_version() warn: should this return really be negated?
drivers/hid/hid-logitech-hidpp.c:398 hidpp_devicenametype_get_count() warn: should this return really be negated?
drivers/hid/hid-logitech-hidpp.c:417 hidpp_devicenametype_get_device_name() warn: should this return really be negated?
drivers/hid/hid-logitech-hidpp.c:524 hidpp_touchpad_get_raw_info() warn: should this return really be negated?

The problem lies in hidpp_send_message_sync() which can return 2 types of
errors depending of their sign. Adding a comment there to clarify what is
happening.

To solve that, print an error in case of a protocol problem, and raise
-EPROTO instead.
