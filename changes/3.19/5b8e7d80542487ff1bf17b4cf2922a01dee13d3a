xen: Delay invalidating extra memory

When the physical memory configuration is initialized the p2m entries
for not pouplated memory pages are set to "invalid". As those pages
are beyond the hypervisor built p2m list the p2m tree has to be
extended.

This patch delays processing the extra memory related p2m entries
during the boot process until some more basic memory management
functions are callable. This removes the need to create new p2m
entries until virtual memory management is available.
