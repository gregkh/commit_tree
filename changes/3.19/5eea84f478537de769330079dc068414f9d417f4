if_tun: add TUNSETVNETLE/TUNGETVNETLE

ifreq flags field is only 16 bit wide, so setting IFF_VNET_LE there has
no effect:
doesn't fit in two bytes.

The tests passed apparently because they have an even number of bugs,
all cancelling out.

Luckily we didn't release a kernel with this flag, so it's
not too late to fix this.

Add TUNSETVNETLE/TUNGETVNETLE to really achieve the purpose
of IFF_VNET_LE.

This has an added benefit that if we ever want a BE flag,
we won't have to deal with weird configurations like
setting both LE and BE at the same time.

IFF_VNET_LE will be dropped in a follow-up patch.
