audit: don't attempt to lookup PIDs when changing PID filtering audit rules

Commit f1dc4867 ("audit: anchor all pid references in the initial pid
namespace") introduced a find_vpid() call when adding/removing audit
rules with PID/PPID filters; unfortunately this is problematic as
find_vpid() only works if there is a task with the associated PID
alive on the system.  The following commands demonstrate a simple
reproducer.

	# auditctl -D
	# auditctl -l
	# autrace /bin/true
	# auditctl -l

This patch resolves the problem by simply using the PID provided by
the user without any additional validation, e.g. no calls to check to
see if the task/PID exists.
