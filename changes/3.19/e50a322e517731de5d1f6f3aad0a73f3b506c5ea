usb: Do not re-read descriptors for wired devices in usb_authorize_device()

This patch modifies the usb_authorize_device() function such as that it does
not reload the device descriptor for wired devices. The reasons for this
are as follows:

* Some devices dislike the master requesting the descriptor from them twice,
  failing on the usb_get_device_descriptor() call with -ETIMEOUT. Observed this
  on my Pretec 16GB flash drive (4146:ba65).

* Malicious device could send two different descriptors - one before
  authorization, used by userspace to determine whether to authorize it and
  second to be actually used by the kernel when determining which drivers to
  bind.
