scsi: never drop to untagged mode during queue ramp down

Dropping to untagged mode when ramping down a queue due to QUEUE FULL
events has two problems:

 - nothing in the midlayer or drivers ever moves back to tagged mode
   during queue ramp up.
 - cmd_per_lun isn't the untagged queue depth for many modern drivers
   that can handle multiple untagged commands, and this is the only
   place in the midlayer assuming that.
