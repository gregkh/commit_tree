nfsd: minor off by one checks in __write_versions()

My static checker complains that if "len == remaining" then it means we
have truncated the last character off the version string.

The intent of the code is that we print as many versions as we can
without truncating a version.  Then we put a newline at the end.  If the
newline can't fit we return -EINVAL.
