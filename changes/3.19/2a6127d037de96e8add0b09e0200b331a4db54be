PM / OPP: remove double calls to find_device_opp()

By mistake we called find_device_opp() twice in of_free_opp_table(), fix it.

Generated diff doesn't show the problem well and so here is the code snippet:

void of_free_opp_table(struct device *dev)
{
	struct device_opp *dev_opp = find_device_opp(dev);
	struct dev_pm_opp *opp, *tmp;

	/* Check for existing list for 'dev' */
	dev_opp = find_device_opp(dev);

	...
}
