Btrfs: don't ignore log btree writeback errors

If an error happens during writeback of log btree extents, make sure the
error is returned to the caller (fsync), so that it takes proper action
(commit current transaction) instead of writing a superblock that points
to log btrees with all or some nodes that weren't durably persisted.
