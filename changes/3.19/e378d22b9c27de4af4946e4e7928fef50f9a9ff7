ARM: OMAP2+: gpmc: Always enable A26-A11 for non NAND devices

Although RESET state of LIMITEDADDRESS bit in GPMC_CONFIG register
is 0 (i.e. A26-A11 enabled), faulty bootloaders might accidentally
set this bit. e.g. u-boot 2014.07 with CONFIG_NOR disabled.

Explicity disable LIMITEDADDRESS bit for non NAND devices so that
they can always work.
