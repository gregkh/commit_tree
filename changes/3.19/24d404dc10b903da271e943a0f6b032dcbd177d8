mm: memcontrol: switch soft limit default back to infinity

Commit 3e32cb2e0a12 ("mm: memcontrol: lockless page counters")
accidentally switched the soft limit default from infinity to zero,
which turns all memcgs with even a single page into soft limit excessors
and engages soft limit reclaim on all of them during global memory
pressure.  This makes global reclaim generally more aggressive, but also
inverts the meaning of existing soft limit configurations where unset
soft limits are usually more generous than set ones.
