i2c: add support for Diolan DLN-2 USB-I2C adapter

This patch adds support for the Diolan DLN-2 I2C master module. Due
to hardware limitations it does not support SMBUS quick commands.

Information about the USB protocol interface can be found in the
Programmer's Reference Manual [1], see section 6.2.2 for the I2C
master module commands and responses.
