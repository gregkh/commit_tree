Fnic: For Standalone C series, "sending VLAN request" message seen even if the link is down

When physical link between standalone C series and switch is down,
the fip timer is not turned off and timer expiration will keep sending
vlan request.

It can be fixed by stopping the fip_timer and
it will be restarted automatically when Link is up.

- Increment fnic version from 1.6.0.14 to 1.6.0.15
