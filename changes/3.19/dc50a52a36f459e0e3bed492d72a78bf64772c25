Revert "rt2x00: Endless loop on hub port power down"

This reverts commit 2ad69ac5976191e9bb7dc4044204a504653ad1bb. It
causes wireless device disappear when we get -EPROTO error form USB
request. I encounter such situation occasionally when resume form
suspend with RT3070 adapter:

[  289.619985] ieee80211 phy0: rt2x00usb_vendor_request: Error - Vendor Request 0x06 failed for offset 0x0404 with error -71
[  289.639368] ieee80211 phy0: rt2800_wait_bbp_ready: Error - BBP register access failed, aborting
[  289.639374] ieee80211 phy0: rt2800usb_set_device_state: Error - Device failed to enter state 4 (-5)

Without the patch, except printing error, device works just fine after
resume.

Currently after timeouts and REGISTER_BUSY_COUNT tuning, we should
not have any "endless loop", though we can wait quite long when driver
is trying to communicate with the device through non functioning USB
connection. Generally the problem that commit 2ad69ac597619 solves
is kinda artificial.
