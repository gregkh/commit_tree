arm: mvebu: add .dts file for Synology DS213j

Synology DS213j is a 2-bay NAS powered by a Marvell Armada 370
(88F6710 @1.2Ghz). It is very similar on many aspects to previous
2-bay synology models based on Marvell kirkwood SoC. Here is a
short summary of the device:

 - 512MB RAM
 - boot on SPI flash (64Mbit Micron N25Q064)
 - 1 GbE interface (Armada MAC connected to a Marvell 88E1512
   PHY via SGMII)
 - 2 rear USB 2.0 ports (directly handled by the Armada 370)
 - 2 internal SATA ports handled by the Armada 370: 2 GPIO for
   presence, 2 for powering them
 - two front amber LED (disk1, disk2) controlled by the SoC
 - Seiko S-35390A I2C RTC chip
 - UART0 providing serial console
 - UART1 used for poweroff (connected to a TI MSP430F2111)
 - Fan handled via 4 GPIO (3 for speed, 1 for alarm)
