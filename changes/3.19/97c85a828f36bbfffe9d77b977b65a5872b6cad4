ceph: introduce global empty snap context

Current snaphost code does not properly handle moving inode from one
empty snap realm to another empty snap realm. After changing inode's
snap realm, some dirty pages' snap context can be not equal to inode's
i_head_snap. This can trigger BUG() in ceph_put_wrbuffer_cap_refs()

The fix is introduce a global empty snap context for all empty snap
realm. This avoids triggering the BUG() for filesystem with no snapshot.
