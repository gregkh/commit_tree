RDMA/cxgb4: Configure 0B MRs to match HW implementation

0B MRs need some tweaks to work correctly with HW. When writing the
TPTE, if the MR length is zero we now:

1) turn off all permissions
2) set the length to -1

While functionality/capabilities of the MR are the same with these
changes, it resolves a dapltest 0B RDMA Read test failure.  Based on
