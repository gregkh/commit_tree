ALSA: hda - Drop AZX_DCAPS_ALIGN_BUFSIZE

We introduced AZX_DCAPS_ALIGN_BUFSIZE to explicity show that the
controller needs the alignment, with a slight hope that the buffer
size alignment will be disabled as default in future.  But the reality
tells that most chips need the buffer size alignment, and it'll be
likely enabled in future, too.

This patch drops AZX_DCAPS_ALIGN_BUFSIZE to give back one more
precious DCAPS bit for future use.  At the same time, rename
AZX_DCAPS_BUFSIZE with AZX_DCAPS_NO_ALIGN_BUFSIZE for avoiding
confusion.

AZX_DCAPS_ALIGN_BUFSIZE are still kept (but commented out) in each
DCAPS presets for a purpose as markers.
