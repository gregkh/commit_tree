usb: host: ohci: omap: fix build breakage

commit e47d925 (usb: move the OTG state
from the USB PHY to the OTG structure) moved
the OTG state field from struct usb_phy to
struct usb_otg but, even though I fixed many
other build breakages, I still missed one
on ohci-omap.c.

Fix the build breakage now.

drivers/usb/host/ohci-omap.c: In function ‘start_hnp’:
drivers/usb/host/ohci-omap.c:186:19: error: request for member ‘state’ in something not a structure or union
  hcd->usb_phy->otg.state = OTG_STATE_A_SUSPEND;
