drm/plane: Pass old state to ->atomic_update()

In most situations it will be useful to have the old state passed to the
->atomic_update() callback. For example if a plane is being disabled the
new state's .crtc field will be NULL, but some drivers may rely on this
field to program the CRTCs registers.

v2: rename variable to old_plane_state and remove redundant comment as
suggested by Daniel Vetter, remove an Exynos hunk that doesn't apply to
drm-next and add a hunk for pending MSM mdp5 changes
