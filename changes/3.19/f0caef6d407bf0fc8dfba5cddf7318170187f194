IB/iser: Terminate connection before cleaning inflight tasks

When closing the connection, we should first terminate the connection
(in case it was not previously terminated) to guarantee the QP is in
error state and we are done with servicing IO. Only then go ahead with
tasks cleanup via iscsi_conn_stop.
