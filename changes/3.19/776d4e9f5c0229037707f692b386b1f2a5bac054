i40e: adds FCoE configure option

Adds FCoE config option I40E_FCOE, so that FCoE can be enabled
as needed but otherwise have it disabled by default.

This also eliminate multiple FCoE config checks, instead now just
one config check for CONFIG_I40E_FCOE.

The I40E FCoE was added with 3.17 kernel and therefore this patch
shall be applied to stable 3.17 kernel also.
