zram: implement rw_page operation of zram

This patch implements rw_page operation for zram block device.

I implemented the feature in zram and tested it.  Test bed was the G2, LG
electronic mobile device, whtich has msm8974 processor and 2GB memory.

With a memory allocation test program consuming memory, the system
generates swap.

Operating time of swap_write_page() was measured.

--------------------------------------------------
|             |   operating time   | improvement |
|             |  (20 runs average) |             |
--------------------------------------------------
|with patch   |    1061.15 us      |    +2.4%    |
--------------------------------------------------
|without patch|    1087.35 us      |             |
--------------------------------------------------

Each test(with paged_io,with BIO) result set shows normal distribution and
has equal variance.  I mean the two values are valid result to compare.  I
can say operation with paged I/O(without BIO) is faster 2.4% with
confidence level 95%.
