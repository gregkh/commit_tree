toshiba_acpi: Fix regression caused by backlight extra check code

Bug 86521 uncovered that some TOS6208 devices also return
non zero values on a write call to the backlight method,
thus getting caught and bailed out by the extra check code.

This patch changes the set_lcd_brightness function to its
"original" state by just adapting it to the new function
format.
