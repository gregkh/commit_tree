KVM: s390: Small fixes for the PFMF handler

This patch includes two small fixes for the PFMF handler: First, the
start address for PFMF has to be masked according to the current
addressing mode, which is now done with kvm_s390_logical_to_effective().
Second, the protection exceptions have a lower priority than the
specification exceptions, so the check for low-address protection
has to be moved after the last spot where we inject a specification
exception.
