ALSA: usb-audio: Add mixer control for Digidesign Mbox 1 clock source

This patch provides the infrastructure for the Digidesign Mbox 1
to have a mixer control for selecting the clock source.
Valid options are Internal and S/PDIF external sync.
A non-documented command is sent to the device to enable this feature
found by reverse engineering and bus snooping.
