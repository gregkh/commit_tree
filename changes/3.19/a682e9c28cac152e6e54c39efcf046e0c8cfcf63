ncpfs: return proper error from NCP_IOC_SETROOT ioctl

If some error happens in NCP_IOC_SETROOT ioctl, the appropriate error
return value is then (in most cases) just overwritten before we return.
This can result in reporting success to userspace although error happened.

This bug was introduced by commit 2e54eb96e2c8 ("BKL: Remove BKL from
ncpfs").  Propagate the errors correctly.
