dm cache: fix spurious cell_defer when dealing with partial block at end of device

We never bother caching a partial block that is at the back end of the
origin device.  No cell ever gets locked, but the calling code was
assuming it was and trying to release it.

Now the code only releases if the cell has been set to a non NULL
value.
