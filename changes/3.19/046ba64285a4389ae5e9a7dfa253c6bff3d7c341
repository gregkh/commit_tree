target: Drop arbitrary maximum I/O size limit

This patch drops the arbitrary maximum I/O size limit in sbc_parse_cdb(),
which currently for fabric_max_sectors is hardcoded to 8192 (4 MB for 512
byte sector devices), and for hw_max_sectors is a backend driver dependent
value.

This limit is problematic because Linux initiators have only recently
started to honor block limits MAXIMUM TRANSFER LENGTH, and other non-Linux
based initiators (eg: MSFT Fibre Channel) can also generate I/Os larger
than 4 MB in size.

Currently when this happens, the following message will appear on the
target resulting in I/Os being returned with non recoverable status:

  SCSI OP 28h with too big sectors 16384 exceeds fabric_max_sectors: 8192

Instead, drop both [fabric,hw]_max_sector checks in sbc_parse_cdb(),
and convert the existing hw_max_sectors into a purely informational
attribute used to represent the granuality that backend driver and/or
subsystem code is splitting I/Os upon.

Also, update FILEIO with an explicit FD_MAX_BYTES check in fd_execute_rw()
to deal with the one special iovec limitiation case.

v2 changes:
  - Drop hw_max_sectors check in sbc_parse_cdb()
