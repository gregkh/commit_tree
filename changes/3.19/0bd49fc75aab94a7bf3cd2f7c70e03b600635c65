Bluetooth: Track both local and remote L2CAP fixed channel mask

To pave the way for future fixed channels to be added easily we should
track both the local and remote mask on a per-L2CAP connection (struct
l2cap_conn) basis. So far the code has used a global variable in a racy
way which anyway needs fixing.

This patch renames the existing conn->fixed_chan_mask that tracked
the remote mask to conn->remote_fixed_chan and adds a new variable
conn->local_fixed_chan to track the local mask. Since the HS support
info is now available in the local mask we can remove the
conn->hs_enabled variable.
