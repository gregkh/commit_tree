drm: Fix DRM_FORCE_ON_DIGITAL use

A connector may be forced on from the command line via video=
command line setting. The digital output of dual-mode connectors
can also be specifically selected and forced on; eg., 'video=DVI-I-2:D'.
However, in this case, the connector->status will be mistakenly set to
connector_status_disconnected, and the connector will not be mode set.

Fix the connector->status when connector->force is DRM_FORCE_ON_DIGITAL.

Note that this seems to have been broken ever since the introduction
of the connector forcing support in
