x86, kvm, vmx: Don't set LOAD_IA32_EFER when host and guest match

There's nothing to switch if the host and guest values are the same.
I am unable to find evidence that this makes any difference
whatsoever.

[I could see a difference on Nehalem.  From 5 runs:

 userspace exit, guest!=host   12200 11772 12130 12164 12327
 userspace exit, guest=host    11983 11780 11920 11919 12040
 lightweight exit, guest!=host  3214  3220  3238  3218  3337
 lightweight exit, guest=host   3178  3193  3193  3187  3220

 This passes the t-test with 99% confidence for userspace exit,
 98.5% confidence for lightweight exit. - Paolo]
