KVM: x86: support XSAVES usage in the host

Userspace is expecting non-compacted format for KVM_GET_XSAVE, but
struct xsave_struct might be using the compacted format.  Convert
in order to preserve userspace ABI.

Likewise, userspace is passing non-compacted format for KVM_SET_XSAVE
but the kernel will pass it to XRSTORS, and we need to convert back.
