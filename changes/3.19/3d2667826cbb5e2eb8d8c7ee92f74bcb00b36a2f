virtio_config: fix virtio_cread_bytes

virtio_cread_bytes is implemented incorrectly in case length happens to
be 2,4 or 8 bytes: transports and devices will assume it's an integer
value that has to be converted to LE format.

Let's just do multiple 1-byte reads: this also makes life easier
for transports who only need to implement 1,2,4 and 8 byte reads.
