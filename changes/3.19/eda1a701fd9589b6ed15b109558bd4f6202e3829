ASoC: ac97: Use static ac97_bus

We always pass soc_ac97_ops to snd_soc_new_ac97_codec(). So instead of
allocating a snd_ac97_bus in snd_soc_new_ac97_codec() just use a static one
that gets initialized when snd_soc_set_ac97_ops() is called.

Also drop the device number parameter from snd_soc_new_ac97_codec(). We
currently only support one device per bus and all drivers pass 0 for the
device number. And if we should ever support multiple devices per bus it
wouldn't be up to individual AC'97 device drivers to pick their number, but
rather either the AC'97 adapter driver or the core code will assign them.
