kvm: add a memslot flag for incoherent memory regions

Memory regions may be incoherent with the caches, typically when the
guest has mapped a host system RAM backed memory region as uncached.
Add a flag KVM_MEMSLOT_INCOHERENT so that we can tag these memslots
and handle them appropriately when mapping them.
