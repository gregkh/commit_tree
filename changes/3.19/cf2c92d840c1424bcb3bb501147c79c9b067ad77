mac80211: replace restart_complete() with reconfig_complete()

Drivers might want to know also when mac80211 has
completed reconfiguring after resume (e.g. in order
to know when frames can be passed to mac80211).

Rename restart_complete() to a more-generic reconfig_complete(),
and add a new enum to indicate the reconfiguration type.

Update the current users with the new prototype.
