NFS: fix subtle change in COMMIT behavior

Recent work in the pgio layer made it possible for there to be more than one
request per page. This caused a subtle change in commit behavior, because
write.c:nfs_commit_unstable_pages compares the number of *pages* waiting for
writeback against the number of requests on a commit list to choose when to
send a COMMIT in a non-blocking flush.

This is probably hard to hit in normal operation - you have to be using
rsize/wsize < PAGE_SIZE, or pnfs with lots of boundaries that are not page
aligned to have a noticeable change in behavior.
