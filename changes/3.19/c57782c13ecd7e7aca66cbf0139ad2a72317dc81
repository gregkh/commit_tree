ima: require signature based appraisal

This patch provides CONFIG_IMA_APPRAISE_SIGNED_INIT kernel configuration
option to force IMA appraisal using signatures. This is useful, when EVM
key is not initialized yet and we want securely initialize integrity or
any other functionality.

It forces embedded policy to require signature. Signed initialization
script can initialize EVM key, update the IMA policy and change further
requirement of everything to be signed.

Changes in v3:
* kernel parameter fixed to configuration option in the patch description

Changes in v2:
* policy change of this patch separated from the key loading patch
