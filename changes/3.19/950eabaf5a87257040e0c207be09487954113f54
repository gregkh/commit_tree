drm/i915: vlv: fix display IRQ enable/disable

We want to enable/disable display IRQs only if global i915 IRQs are
enabled. To check the latter it's not enough to consult the DRM
dev->irq_enabled flag, since runtime PM can disable/enable IRQs
and it won't adjust this flag only the i915 specific
dev_priv->pm._irqs_disabled flag. Fix this by using the proper
intel_irqs_enabled() helper instead.

Fortunately this didn't cause an actual problem since even if we enabled
display IRQs too early (before enabling global i915 IRQs) the
VLV_MASTER_IER would still be clear masking all IRQs.
