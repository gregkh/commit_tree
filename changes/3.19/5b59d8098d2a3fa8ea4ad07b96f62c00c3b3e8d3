ALSA: oxfw: Add support for AV/C stream format command to get/set supported stream formation

OXFW970/971 may supports AV/C Stream Format Information Specification 1.1
Working Draft (Apr 2005, 1394TA). By using this command, drivers can get to know
stream formations which device supports.

This commit adds 'EXTENDED STREAM FORMAT INFORMATION' command. This command
has two subfunctions, 'SINGLE' and 'LIST'. Drivers can use 'SINGLE' subfunction
to know/set current formation of AMDTP stream, Drivers can use 'LIST'
subfunction to know an available formation of AMDTP stream in a certain sampling
rate.

But some devices don't implement the 'LIST' subfunction. So this commit uses
an assumption that 'if they don't implement it, they don't change stream
formation depending on current each sampling rate'. With this assumption, this
driver generates formations for such devices by:
 1.getting current formation by SINGLE subfunction
 2.getting supported sampling rates
 3.applying current formation for all of supported sampling rates

Followed commit implements a parser of this format information.
