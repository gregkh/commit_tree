ARM: 8288/1: dma-mapping: don't detach devices without an IOMMU during teardown

When tearing down the DMA ops for a device via of_dma_deconfigure, we
unconditionally detach the device from its IOMMU domain. For devices
that aren't actually behind an IOMMU, this produces a "Not attached"
warning message on the console.

This patch changes the teardown code so that we don't detach from the
IOMMU domain when there isn't an IOMMU dma mapping to start with.
