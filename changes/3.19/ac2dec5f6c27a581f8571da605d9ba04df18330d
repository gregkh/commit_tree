arm64: Switch to adrp for loading the stub vectors

The hyp stub vectors are currently loaded using adr. This
instruction has a +/- 1MB range for the loading address. If
the alignment for sections is changed the address may be more
than 1MB away, resulting in reclocation errors. Switch to using
adrp for getting the address to ensure we aren't affected by the
location of the __hyp_stub_vectors.
