sched, tty: Deal with nested sleeps

n_tty_{read,write} are wait loops with sleeps in. Wait loops rely on
task_struct::state and sleeps do too, since that's the only means of
actually sleeping. Therefore the nested sleeps destroy the wait loop
state.

Fix this by using the new woken_wake_function and wait_woken() stuff,
which registers wakeups in wait and thereby allows shrinking the
task_state::state changes to the actual sleep part.
