ncr5380: Fix compiler warnings and __setup options

Some __setup() options mentioned in Documentation/scsi don't work because
a few lines of code went missing sometime since Linux 2.4. Fix the options
and thus fix some compiler warnings for both the non-modular case,

    CC      drivers/scsi/dtc.o
drivers/scsi/dtc.c:176:20: warning: 'dtc_setup' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]

and the modular case,

    CC [M]  drivers/scsi/pas16.o
drivers/scsi/pas16.c:335:20: warning: 'pas16_setup' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
    CC [M]  drivers/scsi/t128.o
drivers/scsi/t128.c:147:20: warning: 't128_setup' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
