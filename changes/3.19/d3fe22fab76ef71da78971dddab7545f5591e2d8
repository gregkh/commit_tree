[media] firewire: Deletion of an unnecessary check before the function call "dvb_unregister_device"

The dvb_unregister_device() function tests whether its argument is NULL
and then returns immediately. Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
