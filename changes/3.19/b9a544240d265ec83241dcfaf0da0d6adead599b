scripts/package: binrpm-pkg do not create source and devel package

When doing make binrpm-pkg we only want to build the binary and header
package as the documentation of binrpm-pkg target claims. Hence this
patch avoid building the source and devel package. This makes binrpm-pkg
target lot faster and way more usefull.
