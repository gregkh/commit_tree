s390/docs: Fix the documentation of the address spaces

The information about the address spaces was completely outdated, since
the usage of the address spaces changed quite a bit since the early days.
This patch now updates the information about the usage of the address
spaces, mostly by using the description from Heiko's patch "rework uaccess
code - fix locking issues" (457f2180951cdcbfb4657ddcc83b486e93497f56).
