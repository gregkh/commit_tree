NFC: digital: Enforce NFC-DEP PNI sequencing

NFC-DEP DEP_REQ and DEP_RES exchanges using 'I'
and 'ACK/NACK' PDUs have a sequence number called
the Packet Number Information (PNI).  The PNI
is incremented (modulo 4) after every DEP_REQ/
DEP_RES pair and should be verified by the digital
layer code.  That verification isn't always done,
though, so add code to make sure that it is done.
