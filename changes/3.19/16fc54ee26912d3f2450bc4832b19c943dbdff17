staging, rtl8192e, LLVMLinux: Make static local in inline function const

rtllib_association_req is a (large) inline function which defines 2 constant
static arrays which aren't labelled as const. As a result clang complains with:

non-constant static local variable in inline function may be different in
different files
[-Wstatic-local-in-inline]
  static u8       AironetIeOui[] = {0x00, 0x01, 0x66};
  ^
The solution is making them "static const".

However doing so requires dropping const when being used with struct
octet_string. However the value is used in a const fashion thereafter, so no
harm done.
