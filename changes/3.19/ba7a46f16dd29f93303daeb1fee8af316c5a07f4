net: Convert LIMIT_NETDEBUG to net_dbg_ratelimited

Use the more common dynamic_debug capable net_dbg_ratelimited
and remove the LIMIT_NETDEBUG macro.

All messages are still ratelimited.

Some KERN_<LEVEL> uses are changed to KERN_DEBUG.

This may have some negative impact on messages that were
emitted at KERN_INFO that are not not enabled at all unless
DEBUG is defined or dynamic_debug is enabled.  Even so,
these messages are now _not_ emitted by default.

This also eliminates the use of the net_msg_warn sysctl
"/proc/sys/net/core/warnings".  For backward compatibility,
the sysctl is not removed, but it has no function.  The extern
declaration of net_msg_warn is removed from sock.h and made
static in net/core/sysctl_net_core.c

Miscellanea:

o Update the sysctl documentation
o Remove the embedded uses of pr_fmt
o Coalesce format fragments
o Realign arguments
