staging: comedi: addi_apci_3120: remove interrupt support from ai (*insn_read)

(*insn_read) functions are supposed to do simple polled reads of a single
channel. This driver tries to be tricky and allow enabling interrupts in
the analog input (*insn_config) to allow the (*insn_read) to read samples
with the end-of-conversion interrupt.

The (*insn_config) doesn't follow the comedi API and this operation mode
is not part of the API.

Remove the interrupt support from the (*insn_read) as well as the support
code in the (*insn_config) and interrupt handler.
