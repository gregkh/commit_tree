crypto: caam - fix error reporting

The error code returned by hardware is four bits wide with an expected
zero MSB. A hardware error condition where the error code can get between
0x8 and 0xf will trigger an out of bound array access on the error
message table.
This patch fixes the invalid array access following such an error and
reports the condition.
