tcp: fix stretch ACK bugs in Reno

Change Reno to properly handle stretch ACKs in additive increase mode
by passing in the count of ACKed packets to tcp_cong_avoid_ai().

In addition, if snd_cwnd crosses snd_ssthresh during slow start
processing, and we then exit slow start mode, we need to carry over
any remaining "credit" for packets ACKed and apply that to additive
increase by passing this remaining "acked" count to
tcp_cong_avoid_ai().
