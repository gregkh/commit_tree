serial: imx: clean up imx_poll_put_char()

imx_put_poll_char() has been simplified to remove the code to disable
interrupts. The present code can corrupt register state when re-entered
from FIQ handler.

Switch to _relaxed() MMIO functions (which are safe for polled I/O and
needed to avoid taking spin locks).
