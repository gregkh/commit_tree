exit: reparent: introduce find_alive_thread()

Add the new simple helper to factor out the for_each_thread() code in
find_child_reaper() and find_new_reaper().  It can also simplify the
potential PF_EXITING -> exit_state change, plus perhaps we can change this
code to take SIGNAL_GROUP_EXIT into account.
