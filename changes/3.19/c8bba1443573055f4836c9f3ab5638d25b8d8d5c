zfcp: bring back unit sysfs attributes for automatic LUN scan

Through sysfs attributes, zfcp unit objects
provide a trigger for manual LUN recovery
and export information for problem determination.

"[SCSI] zfcp: Allow midlayer to scan for LUNs when running in NPIV mode"
and when attaching SCSI devices through this new optional method,
no more zfcp unit objects are allocated for such SCSI devices.
Hence, the above-mentioned trigger and information were missing.

The information and context is located in SCSI transport device data since
b62a8d9b45b971a67a0f8413338c230e3117dff5
"[SCSI] zfcp: Use SCSI device data zfcp_scsi_dev instead of zfcp_unit"
57c237731b92fadc7d44824276313ec330b1989b
"[SCSI] zfcp: Add zfcp private struct as SCSI device driver data"
Hence, introduce the trigger and the information unconditionally
for all SCSI devices attached through zfcp.

We prefix the attribute names with 'zfcp_' to prevent collisions and
to avoid mix-ups such as with the common 'state' attribute.

Since some of the new attribute views do not need zfcp_port
in the ZFCP_DEFINE_SCSI_ATTR helper macro, remove zfcp_port
to avoid compiler warnings on unused variable.
It's easy to open code the conversion from zfcp_scsi_dev to zfcp_port
for the two already existing attributes hba_id and wwpn.
