brcmsmac: don't leak kernel memory via printk()

Debug code prints the fifo name via custom dev_warn() wrappers. The
fifo_names array is only non-zero when debugging is manually enabled,
which is all well and good. However, it's *not* good that this array
uses zero-length arrays in the non-debug case, and so it doesn't
actually have any memory allocated to it. This means that as far as we
know, fifo_names[i] actually points to garbage memory.

I've seen this in my log:

[ 4601.205511] brcmsmac bcma0:1: wl0: brcms_c_d11hdrs_mac80211: ï¿½GeL txop exceeded phylen 137/256 dur 1602/1504

So let's give this array space enough to fill it with a NULL byte.
