Bluetooth: Fix setting conn->pending_sec_level value from link key

When a connection is requested the conn->pending_sec_level value gets
set to whatever level the user requested the connection to be. During
the pairing process there are various sanity checks to try to ensure
that the right length PIN or right IO Capability is used to satisfy the
target security level. However, when we finally get hold of the link key
that is to be used we should still set the actual final security level
from the key type.

This way when we eventually get an Encrypt Change event the correct
value gets copied to conn->sec_level.
