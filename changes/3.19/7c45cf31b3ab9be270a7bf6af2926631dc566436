cpufreq: Introduce ->ready() callback for cpufreq drivers

Currently there is no callback for cpufreq drivers which is called once the
policy is ready to be used. There are some requirements where such a callback is
required.

One of them is registering a cooling device with the help of
of_cpufreq_cooling_register(). This routine tries to get 'struct cpufreq_policy'
for CPUs which isn't yet initialed at the time ->init() is called and so we face
issues while registering the cooling device.

Because we can't register cooling device from ->init(), we need a callback that
is called after the policy is ready to be used and hence we introduce ->ready()
callback.
