megaraid_sas: make HBA operational after LD_MAP_SYNC DCMD in OCR path

In OCR(Online Controller Reset) path, driver sets adapter state to
MEGASAS_HBA_OPERATIONAL before getting new RAID map.  There will be a small
window where IO will come from OS with old RAID map. This patch will update
adapter state to MEGASAS_HBA_OPERATIONAL, only after driver has new RAID
map to avoid any IOs getting build using old RAID map.
