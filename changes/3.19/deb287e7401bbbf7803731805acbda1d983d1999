tty: Document check_tty_count() requires tty_lock held

Holding the tty_lock() is necessary to prevent concurrent changes
to the tty count that may cause it to differ from the open file
list count. The tty_lock() is already held at all call sites.

NB: Note that the check for the pty master tty count is safe because
the slave's tty_lock() is held while decrementing the pty master
tty count.
