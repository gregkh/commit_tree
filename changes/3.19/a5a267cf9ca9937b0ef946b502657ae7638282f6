ASoC: rt286: build warning of section mismatch

while building we were getting the following build warning:

Section mismatch in reference from the function rt286_i2c_probe()
to the variable .init.data:force_combo_jack_table
The function rt286_i2c_probe() references
the variable __initdata force_combo_jack_table.
This is often because rt286_i2c_probe lacks a __initdata
annotation or the annotation of force_combo_jack_table is wrong.

we were getting the warning as force_combo_jack_table was marked
with __initdata
