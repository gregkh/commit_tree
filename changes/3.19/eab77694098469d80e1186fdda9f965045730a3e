storage: Enable multi-target mode as vendor driver does for SCM eUSCSI bridge

usb_stor_euscsi_init() enables multi-target mode for SCM eUSB SCSI bridge
devices. The control message it sends has wLength = 1 and the byte sent is
0x01. While that works, the SCM Windows driver does it with wLength = 0. We
may as well match what the SCM driver does.
