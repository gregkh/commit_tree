ALSA: i2sbus: Deletion of unnecessary checks before the function call "release_and_free_resource"

The release_and_free_resource() function tests whether its argument is NULL
and then returns immediately. Thus the test around the call is not needed.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
