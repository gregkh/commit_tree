drm/i915/skl: Stage the pipe DDB allocation

To correctly flush the new DDB allocation we need to know about the pipe
allocation layout inside the DDB in order to sequence the re-allocation
to not cause a newly allocated pipe to fetch from a space that was
previously allocated to another pipe.

This patch preserves the per-pipe (start,end) allocation to be used in
the flush.
