mac80211: free management frame keys when removing station

When writing the code to allow per-station GTKs, I neglected to
take into account the management frame keys (index 4 and 5) when
freeing the station and only added code to free the first four
data frame keys.

Fix this by iterating the array of keys over the right length.
