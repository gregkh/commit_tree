mm: fix huge zero page accounting in smaps report

As a small zero page, huge zero page should not be accounted in smaps
report as normal page.

For small pages we rely on vm_normal_page() to filter out zero page, but
vm_normal_page() is not designed to handle pmds.  We only get here due
hackish cast pmd to pte in smaps_pte_range() -- pte and pmd format is not
necessary compatible on each and every architecture.

Let's add separate codepath to handle pmds.  follow_trans_huge_pmd() will
detect huge zero page for us.

We would need pmd_dirty() helper to do this properly.  The patch adds it
to THP-enabled architectures which don't yet have one.
