mtd: nand: provide detailed description for raw read/write page methods

read_page_raw and write_page_raw method description is not clear enough.
It clearly specifies that ECC correction should not be involved but does
not talk about specific layout (by layout I mean where in-band and
out-of-band data are stored on the NAND media) used by NAND/ECC
controllers.

Those specific layouts might impact MTD users and thus should be hidden (as
already done in the standard NAND_ECC_HW_SYNDROME implementation).

Clearly state this constraint in the nand_ecc_ctrl struct documentation.
