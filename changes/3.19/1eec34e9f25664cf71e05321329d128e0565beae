usb: musb: musb_cppi41: recognize HS devices in hostmode

There is a poll loop for max 25us for HS devices. Now guess what, I
tested it in gadget mode and forgot about the little detail. Nobody seem
to have it noticedâ€¦
This patch adds the missing logic for hostmode so it is recognized in
host and device mode properly.
