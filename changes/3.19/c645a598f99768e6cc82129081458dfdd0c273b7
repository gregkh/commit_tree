ARM: EXYNOS: Call regulator core suspend prepare and finish functions

The regulator framework has a set of helpers functions to be used when
the system is entering and leaving from suspend but these are not called
on Exynos platforms. This means that the .set_suspend_* function handlers
defined by regulator drivers are not called when the system is suspended.
