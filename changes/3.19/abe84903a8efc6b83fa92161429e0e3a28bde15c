Bluetooth: Use proper nesting annotation for l2cap_chan lock

By default lockdep considers all L2CAP channels equal. This would mean
that we get warnings if a channel is locked when another one's lock is
tried to be acquired in the same thread. This kind of inter-channel
locking dependencies exist in the form of parent-child channels as well
as any channel wishing to elevate the security by requesting procedures
on the SMP channel.

To eliminate the chance for these lockdep warnings we introduce a
nesting level for each channel and use that when acquiring the channel
lock. For now there exists the earlier mentioned three identified
categories: SMP, "normal" channels and parent channels (i.e. those in
BT_LISTEN state). The nesting level is defined as atomic_t since we need
access to it before the lock is actually acquired.
