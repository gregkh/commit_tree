ARM: tegra: Re-add removed SoC id macro to tegra_resume()

Commit d127e9c ("ARM: tegra: make tegra_resume can work with current and later
chips") removed tegra_get_soc_id macro leaving used cpu register corrupted after
branching to v7_invalidate_l1() and as result causing execution of unintended
code on tegra20. Possibly it was expected that r6 would be SoC id func argument
since common cpu reset handler is setting r6 before branching to tegra_resume(),
but neither tegra20_lp1_reset() nor tegra30_lp1_reset() aren't setting r6
register before jumping to resume function. Fix it by re-adding macro.
