udp: Changes to udp_offload to support remote checksum offload

Add a new GSO type, SKB_GSO_TUNNEL_REMCSUM, which indicates remote
checksum offload being done (in this case inner checksum must not
be offloaded to the NIC).

Added logic in __skb_udp_tunnel_segment to handle remote checksum
offload case.
