Smack: Lock mode for the floor and hat labels

The lock access mode allows setting a read lock on a file
for with the process has only read access. The floor label is
defined to make it easy to have the basic system installed such
that everyone can read it. Once there's a desire to read lock
(rationally or otherwise) a floor file a rule needs to get set.
This happens all the time, so make the floor label a little bit
more special and allow everyone lock access, too. By implication,
give processes with the hat label (hat can read everything)
lock access as well. This reduces clutter in the Smack rule set.
