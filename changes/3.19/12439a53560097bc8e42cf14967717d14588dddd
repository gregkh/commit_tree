mac802154: remove channel attributes from sdata

These channel attributes was part of "channel context switch while xmit"
which was removed by commit dc67c6b30f36d57b70b70547a30e7a8432540c6f
("mac802154: tx: remove xmit channel context switch"). This patch
removes these unnecessary variables and use the current_page and
current_channel by wpan_phy struct now.
