Btrfs: report error after failure inlining extent in compressed write path

If cow_file_range_inline() failed, when called from compress_file_range(),
we were tagging the locked page for writeback, end its writeback and unlock it,
but not marking it with an error nor setting AS_EIO in inode's mapping flags.

This made it impossible for a caller of filemap_fdatawrite_range (writepages)
or filemap_fdatawait_range() to know that an error happened. And the return
value of compress_file_range() is useless because it's returned to a workqueue
task and not to the task calling filemap_fdatawrite_range (writepages).

This change applies on top of the previous patchset starting at the patch
titled:

    "[1/5] Btrfs: set page and mapping error on compressed write failure"

Which changed extent_clear_unlock_delalloc() to use SetPageError and
mapping_set_error().
