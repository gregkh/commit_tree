proc: task_state: deuglify the max_fds calculation

1. The usage of fdt looks very ugly, it can't be NULL if ->files is
   not NULL. We can use "unsigned int max_fds" instead.

2. This also allows to move seq_printf(max_fds) outside of task_lock()
   and join it with the previous seq_printf(). See also the next patch.
