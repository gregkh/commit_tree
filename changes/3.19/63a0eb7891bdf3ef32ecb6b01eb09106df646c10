ima: Fix build failure on powerpc when TCG_IBMVTPM dependencies are not met

On powerpc we can end up with IMA=y and PPC_PSERIES=n which leads to:

 warning: (IMA) selects TCG_IBMVTPM which has unmet direct dependencies (TCG_TPM && PPC_PSERIES)
  tpm_ibmvtpm.c:(.text+0x14f3e8): undefined reference to `.plpar_hcall_norets'

I'm not sure why IMA needs to select those user-visible symbols, but if
it must then the simplest fix is to just express the proper dependencies
on the select.
