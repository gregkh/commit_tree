kvm: x86: increase user memory slots to 509

With the 3 private slots, this gives us 512 slots total.
Motivation for this is in addition to assigned devices
support more memory hotplug slots, where 1 slot is
used by a hotplugged memory stick.
It will allow to support upto 256 hotplug memory
slots and leave 253 slots for assigned devices and
other devices that use them.
