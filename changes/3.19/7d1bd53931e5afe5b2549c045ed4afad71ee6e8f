drm/i915: Apply some ocd for IMR vs. IER order during irq enable

When disabling interrupts we do the writes in this order:
IMR,IER,IIR,IIR. But when enabling interrupts we don't do use the
mirrored order, and instead do IIR,IIR,IMR,IER.

I like consistency unless there's a good reason against it, which I
can't think of here, so change the enable order to IIR,IIR,IER,IMR.
