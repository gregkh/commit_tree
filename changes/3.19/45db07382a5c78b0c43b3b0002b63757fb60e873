parisc: fix out-of-register compiler error in ldcw inline assembler function

The __ldcw macro has a problem when its argument needs to be reloaded from
memory. The output memory operand and the input register operand both need to
be reloaded using a register in class R1_REGS when generating 64-bit code.
This fails because there's only a single register in the class. Instead, use a
memory clobber. This also makes the __ldcw macro a compiler memory barrier.
