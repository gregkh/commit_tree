[media] v4l2-ctrls: fix sparse warning

The warning is simple:

drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ctrls.c:1685:15: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)

but the fix isn't.

The core problem was that the conversion from user to kernelspace was
done at too low a level and that needed to be moved up. That made it possible
to drop pointers to v4l2_ext_control from set_ctrl and validate_new and
clean up this sparse warning because those functions now always operate
on kernelspace pointers.
