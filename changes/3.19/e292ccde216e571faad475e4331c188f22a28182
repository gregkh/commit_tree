MIPS: Loongson-3: Add RS780/SBX00 HPET support

CPUFreq driver need external timer, so add hpet at first.

In Loongson 3, only Core-0 can receive external interrupt. As a result,
timekeeping cannot absolutely use HPET timer. We use a hybrid solution:
Core-0 use HPET as its clock event device, but other cores still use
MIPS; clock source is global and doesn't need interrupt, so use HPET.
