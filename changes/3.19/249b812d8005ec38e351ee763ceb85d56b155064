samples: bpf: elf_bpf file loader

simple .o parser and loader using BPF syscall.
.o is a standard ELF generated by LLVM backend

It parses elf file compiled by llvm .c->.o
- parses 'maps' section and creates maps via BPF syscall
- parses 'license' section and passes it to syscall
- parses elf relocations for BPF maps and adjusts BPF_LD_IMM64 insns
  by storing map_fd into insn->imm and marking such insns as BPF_PSEUDO_MAP_FD
- loads eBPF programs via BPF syscall

One ELF file can contain multiple BPF programs.

int load_bpf_file(char *path);
populates prog_fd[] and map_fd[] with FDs received from bpf syscall

bpf_helpers.h - helper functions available to eBPF programs written in C
