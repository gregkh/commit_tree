KVM: x86: update masterclock values on TSC writes

When the guest writes to the TSC, the masterclock TSC copy must be
updated as well along with the TSC_OFFSET update, otherwise a negative
tsc_timestamp is calculated at kvm_guest_time_update.

Once "if (!vcpus_matched && ka->use_master_clock)" is simplified to
"if (ka->use_master_clock)", the corresponding "if (!ka->use_master_clock)"
becomes redundant, so remove the do_request boolean and collapse
everything into a single condition.
