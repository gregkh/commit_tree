net/mlx4_core: Fix kernel Oops (mem corruption) when working with more than 80 VFs

Commit de966c592802 (net/mlx4_core: Support more than 64 VFs) was meant to
allow up to 126 VFs.  However, due to leaving MLX4_MFUNC_MAX too low, using
more than 80 VFs resulted in memory corruptions (and Oopses) when more than
80 VFs were requested. In addition, the number of slaves was left too high.

This commit fixes these issues.
