drm/panel: simple: Update Innolux N116BGE timings

There are several different models of N116BGE. According to commit
0a2288c06aab ("drm/panel: simple: Add Innolux N116BGE panel support"),
the video timings are for the eDP variant.

The clock and htotal values added by that patch are out of spec
according to the datasheets I have seen for the eDP N116BGE (-EA2 and
-EB2).

This patch changes the values to the "Typ" values on the datasheet.
