tty: serial: omap: Remove probe error message

This error message is not necessary. The driver core code will print all
probe error messages. It also resolves some error codes to proper error
messages. For example -EPROBE_DEFER will only be printed as an info message.

This patch removes the error message as the core prints the same
information.
