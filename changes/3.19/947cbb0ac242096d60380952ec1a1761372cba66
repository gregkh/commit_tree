net/mlx4_en: Support for configurable RSS hash function

The ConnectX HW is capable of using one of the following hash functions:
Toeplitz and an XOR hash function. This patch extends the implementation
of the mlx4_en driver set/get_rxfh callbacks to support getting and
setting the RSS hash function used by the device.
