mcb: mcb-pci: Only remap the 1st 0x200 bytes of BAR 0

Currently it is not possible to have a kernel with built-in MCB attached
devices. This results out of the fact that mcb-pci requests PCI BAR 0, then
parses the chameleon table and calls the driver's probe function before
releasing BAR 0 again. When building the kernel with modules this is not a
problem (and therefore it wasn't detected by my tests yet).

A solution is to only remap the 1st 0x200 bytes of a Chameleon PCI device.
0x200 bytes is the maximum size of a Chameleon v2 Table.

Also this patch stops disabling the PCI device on successful registration of MCB
devices.
