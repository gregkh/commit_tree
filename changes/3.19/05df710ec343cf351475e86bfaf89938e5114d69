ftrace/x86: Rename MCOUNT_SAVE_FRAME and add more detailed comments

The name MCOUNT_SAVE_FRAME is rather confusing as it really isn't a
function frame that is saved, but just the required mcount registers
that are needed to be saved before C code may be called. The word
"frame" confuses it as being a function frame which it is not.

Rename MCOUNT_SAVE_FRAME and MCOUNT_RESTORE_FRAME to save_mcount_regs
and restore_mcount_regs respectively. Noticed the lower case, which
keeps it from screaming at the reviewers.
