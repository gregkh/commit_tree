KVM: x86: Emulation of MOV-sreg to memory uses incorrect size

In x86, you can only MOV-sreg to memory with either 16-bits or 64-bits size.
In contrast, KVM may write to 32-bits memory on MOV-sreg. This patch fixes KVM
behavior, and sets the destination operand size to two, if the destination is
memory.

When destination is registers, and the operand size is 32-bits, the high
16-bits in modern CPUs is filled with zero.  This is handled correctly.
