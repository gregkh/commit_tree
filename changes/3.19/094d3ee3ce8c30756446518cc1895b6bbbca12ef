rtc: omap: drop vendor-prefix from power-controller dt property

Drop the vendor-prefix from the "ti,system-power-controller" device-tree
property name.

It has been agreed to make "system-power-controller" a standard property
and to drop the vendor-prefix that is currently used by several drivers.

Note that drivers that have used "<vendor>,system-power-controller" in a
released kernel will need to support both versions.
