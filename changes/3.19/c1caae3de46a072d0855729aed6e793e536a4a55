powerpc/kdump: Ignore failure in enabling big endian exception during crash

In LE kernel, we currently have a hack for kexec that resets the exception
endian before starting a new kernel as the kernel that is loaded could be a
big endian or a little endian kernel. In kdump case, resetting exception
endian fails when one or more cpus is disabled. But we can ignore the failure
and still go ahead, as in most cases crashkernel will be of same endianess
as primary kernel and reseting endianess is not even needed in those cases.
This patch adds a new inline function to say if this is kdump path. This
function is used at places where such a check is needed.
