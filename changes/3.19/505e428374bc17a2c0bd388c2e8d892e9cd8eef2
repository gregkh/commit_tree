powerpc/uaccess: Allow get_user() with bitwise types

At the moment, if p and x are both of the same bitwise type
(eg. __le32), get_user(x, p) produces a sparse warning.

This is because *p is loaded into a long then cast back to typeof(*p).

When typeof(*p) is a bitwise type (which is uncommon), such a cast needs
__force, otherwise sparse produces a warning.

For non-bitwise types __force should have no effect, and should not hide
any legitimate errors.

Note that we are casting to typeof(*p) not typeof(x). Even with the
cast, if x and *p are of different types we should get the warning, so I
think we are not loosing the ability to detect any actual errors.

virtio would like to use bitwise types with get_user() so fix these
spurious warnings by adding __force.
