ARM: dts: imx25: Fix PWM "per" clocks

Currently PWM functionality is broken on mx25 due to the wrong assignment of the
PWM "per" clock.

According to Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/imx25-clock.txt:
	pwm_ipg_per		52

,so update the pwm "per" to use 'pwm_ipg_per' instead of 'per10' clock.

With this change PWM can work fine on mx25.
