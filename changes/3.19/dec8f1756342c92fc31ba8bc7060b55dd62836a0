Btrfs: make inode.c:submit_compressed_extents() return void

Its return value is completely ignored by its single caller and it's
useless anyway, since errors are indicated through SetPageError and
the bit AS_EIO set in the flags of the inode's mapping. The caller
can't do anything with the value, as it's invoked from a workqueue
task and not by the task calling filemap_fdatawrite_range (which calls
the writepages address space callback, which in turn calls the inode's
fill_delalloc callback).
