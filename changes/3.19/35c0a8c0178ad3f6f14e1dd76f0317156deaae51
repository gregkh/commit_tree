ASoC: Intel: Fix block is enabled multiple times issue

During FW parsing and loading, block_list_prepare() may
be called for each raw data block copying and this may
made the hsw_block_enable() called mutiple times, which
increase block->users many times. The result of this is
hsw_block_disable() can't power gated the related block
when trying to free the blocks during suspend, and the
power gating status also confused.

Here check the block user status, only calling enable()
for those blocks who has no user yet. Remember that
this works correctlly on current case, where there are
enough SRAM memory so different module won't share a
memory block. For further usage, we may need restructure
the struct sst_mem_block to save the module list who is
using it.
