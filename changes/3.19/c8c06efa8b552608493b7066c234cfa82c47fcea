mm: convert i_mmap_mutex to rwsem

The i_mmap_mutex is a close cousin of the anon vma lock, both protecting
similar data, one for file backed pages and the other for anon memory.  To
this end, this lock can also be a rwsem.  In addition, there are some
important opportunities to share the lock when there are no tree
modifications.

This conversion is straightforward.  For now, all users take the write
lock.
