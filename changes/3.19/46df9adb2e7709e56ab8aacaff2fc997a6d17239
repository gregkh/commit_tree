drm/atomic: shutdown *current* encoder

In disable_outputs() we need to shut down the outgoing encoder, not the
incoming one (we have already swapped-state at this point).  Without
this, we end up telling the driver to crtc->dpms(OFF) without first
encoder->dpms(OFF), and that makes some hw quite unhappy.
