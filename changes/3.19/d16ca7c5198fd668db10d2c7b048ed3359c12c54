target: Fix R_HOLDER bit usage for AllRegistrants

This patch fixes the usage of R_HOLDER bit for an All Registrants
reservation in READ_FULL_STATUS, where only the registration who
issued RESERVE was being reported as having an active reservation.

It changes core_scsi3_pri_read_full_status() to check ahead of the
list walk of active registrations to see if All Registrants is active,
and if so set R_HOLDER bit and scope/type fields for all active
registrations.
