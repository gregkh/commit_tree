drm/i915: Remove most INVALID_PIPE checks from the backlight code

Now that the backlight device no longer gets registered too early we
should be able to drop most of the INVALID_PIPE checks from the backlight
code.

The only exceptio is the opregion stuff where we may (in theory at
least) get a request from the BIOS already during driver init as soon as
the backlight setup has been done. In which case we can still get the
INVALID_PIPE from intel_get_pipe_from_connector(). So leave that check
in place, and add a comment explaining why.

For the rest, if we still manage to get here with INVALID_PIPE on
VLV/CHV we will now get a WARN from the lower level functions and
can then actually investigate further.

v2: Leave the check in the BIOS related code (Jani)
