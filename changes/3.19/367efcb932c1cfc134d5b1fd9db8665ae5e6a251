ipv6: Avoid redoing fib6_lookup() with reachable = 0 by saving fn

This patch save the fn before doing rt6_backtrack.
Hence, without redo-ing the fib6_lookup(), saved_fn can be used
to redo rt6_select() with RT6_LOOKUP_F_REACHABLE off.

Some minor changes I think make sense to review as a single patch:
* Remove the 'out:' goto label.
* Remove the 'reachable' variable. Only use the 'strict' variable instead.

After this patch, "failing ip6_ins_rt()" should be the only case that
requires a redo of fib6_lookup().
