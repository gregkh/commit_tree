KVM: cpuid: mask more bits in leaf 0xd and subleaves

- EAX=0Dh, ECX=1: output registers EBX/ECX/EDX are reserved.

- EAX=0Dh, ECX>1: output register ECX bit 0 is clear for all the CPUID
leaves we support, because variable "supported" comes from XCR0 and not
XSS.  Bits above 0 are reserved, so ECX is overall zero.  Output register
EDX is reserved.
