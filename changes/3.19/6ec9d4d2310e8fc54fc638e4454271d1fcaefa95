IB/iser: Fix possible SQ overflow

Fix a regression was introduced in commit 6df5a128f0fd ("IB/iser:
Suppress scsi command send completions").

The sig_count was wrongly set to be static variable, thus it is
possible that we won't reach to (sig_count % ISER_SIGNAL_BATCH) == 0
condition (due to races) and the send queue will be overflowed.

Instead keep sig_count per connection. We don't need it to be atomic
as we are safe under the iscsi session frwd_lock taken by libiscsi on
the queuecommand path.
