mm/zbud: init user ops only when it is needed

When zbud is initialized through the zpool wrapper, pool->ops which
points to user-defined operations is always set regardless of whether it
is specified from the upper layer. This causes zbud_reclaim_page() to
iterate its loop for evicting pool pages out without any gain.

This patch sets the user-defined ops only when it is needed, so that
zbud_reclaim_page() can bail out the reclamation loop earlier if there
is no user-defined operations specified.
