arm64: add cpu_capabilities bitmap

For taking note if at least one CPU in the system needs a bug
workaround or would benefit from a code optimization, we create a new
bitmap to hold (artificial) feature bits.
Since elf_hwcap is part of the userland ABI, we keep it alone and
introduce a new data structure for that (along with some accessors).
