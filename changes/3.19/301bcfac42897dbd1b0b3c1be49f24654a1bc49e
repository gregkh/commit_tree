arm64: add Cortex-A53 cache errata workaround

The ARM errata 819472, 826319, 827319 and 824069 define the same
workaround for these hardware issues in certain Cortex-A53 parts.
Use the new alternatives framework and the CPU MIDR detection to
patch "cache clean" into "cache clean and invalidate" instructions if
an affected CPU is detected at runtime.
