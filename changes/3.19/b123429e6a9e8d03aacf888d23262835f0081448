cxl: Unmap MMIO regions when detaching a context

If we need to force detach a context (e.g. due to EEH or simply force
unbinding the driver) we should prevent the userspace contexts from
being able to access the Problem State Area MMIO region further, which
they may have mapped with mmap().

This patch unmaps any mapped MMIO regions when detaching a userspace
context.
