arm64: partially revert "ARM: 8167/1: extend the reserved memory for initrd to be page aligned"

This patch partially reverts commit 421520ba98290a73b35b7644e877a48f18e06004
(only the arm64 part). There is no guarantee that the boot-loader places other
images like dtb in a different page than initrd start/end, especially when the
kernel is built with 64KB pages. When this happens, such pages must not be
freed. The free_reserved_area() already takes care of rounding up "start" and
rounding down "end" to avoid freeing partially used pages.
