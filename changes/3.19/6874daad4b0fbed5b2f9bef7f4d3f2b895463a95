ALSA: usb-audio: Add mode select quirk for Denon/Marantz DACs

Denon/Marantz USB DACs need a specific vendor command to switch between PCM and
DSD mode. This patch adds a new quirk function to switch between the two modes
using the specific USB vendor command.

This patch applies to the following devices:
- Marantz SA-14S1
- Marantz HD-DAC1
