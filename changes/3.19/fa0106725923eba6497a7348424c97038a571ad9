MIPS: BMIPS: Allow BMIPS3300 to utilize SMP ebase relocation code

BMIPS3300 processors do not have the hardware to support SMP, but with a
small tweak, the SMP ebase relocation code allows BMIPS3300-based
platforms to reuse the S2/S3 power management code from BMIPS4380-based
chips.  Normally this is as simple as adding one line to prom_init():

    board_ebase_setup = &bmips_ebase_setup;
