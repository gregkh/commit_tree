net: drop the packet when fails to do software segmentation or header check

Commit cecda693a969816bac5e470e1d9c9c0ef5567bca ("net: keep original skb
which only needs header checking during software GSO") keeps the original
skb for packets that only needs header check, but it doesn't drop the
packet if software segmentation or header check were failed.

Fixes cecda693a9 ("net: keep original skb which only needs header checking during software GSO")
