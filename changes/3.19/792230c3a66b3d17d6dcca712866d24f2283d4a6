x86: Introduce function to get pmd entry pointer

Introduces lookup_pmd_address() to get the address of the pmd entry
related to a virtual address in the current address space. This
function is needed for support of a virtual mapped sparse p2m list
in xen pv domains, as we need the address of the pmd entry, not the
one of the pte in that case.
