coresight-replicator: add CoreSight Replicator driver

This driver manages non-configurable CoreSight Replicator that
takes a single input trace data stream and replicates it to
produce two identical trace data output streams. Replicators
are typically used to route single interleaved trace data
stream to two or more sinks.
