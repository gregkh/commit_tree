atari_NCR5380: Refactor Falcon locking

Simplify falcon_release_lock_if_possible() by making callers responsible for
disabling local IRQ's, which they must do anyway to correctly synchronize
the ST DMA "lock" with core driver data structures. Move this
synchronization logic to the core driver with which it is tightly coupled.

Other LLD's like sun3_scsi and mac_scsi that can make use of this core
driver can just stub out the NCR5380_acquire_dma_irq() and
NCR5380_release_dma_irq() calls so the compiler will eliminate the
ST DMA code.

Remove a redundant local_irq_save/restore pair (irq's are disabled for
interrupt handlers these days). Revise the locking for
atari_scsi_bus_reset(): use local_irq_save/restore() instead of
atari_turnoff/turnon_irq(). There is no guarantee that atari_scsi still
holds the ST DMA lock during EH, so atari_turnoff/turnon_irq() could
end up dropping an IDE or floppy interrupt.
