MIPS: Fix kernel lockup or crash after CPU offline/online

As printk() invocation can cause e.g. a TLB miss, printk() cannot be
called before the exception handlers have been properly initialized.
This can happen e.g. when netconsole has been loaded as a kernel module
and the TLB table has been cleared when a CPU was offline.

Call cpu_report() in start_secondary() only after the exception handlers
have been initialized to fix this.

Without the patch the kernel will randomly either lockup or crash
after a CPU is onlined and the console driver is a module.
