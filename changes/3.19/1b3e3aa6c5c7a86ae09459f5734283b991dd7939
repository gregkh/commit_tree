PM / Kconfig: Replace PM_RUNTIME with PM in dependencies

After commit b2b49ccbdd54 (PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if PM_SLEEP is
selected) PM_RUNTIME is always set if PM is set, so Kconfig options
depending on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME may now be changed to depend on
CONFIG_PM.

Replace PM_RUNTIME with PM in Kconfig dependencies throughout the
tree.
