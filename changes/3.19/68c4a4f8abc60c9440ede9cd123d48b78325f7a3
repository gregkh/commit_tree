pstore: Honor dmesg_restrict sysctl on dmesg dumps

When the kernel.dmesg_restrict restriction is in place, only users with
CAP_SYSLOG should be able to access crash dumps (like: attacker is
trying to exploit a bug, watchdog reboots, attacker can happily read
crash dumps and logs).

This puts the restriction on console-* types as well as sensitive
information could have been leaked there.

Other log types are unaffected.
