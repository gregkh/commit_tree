drm/i915: split intel_cursor_plane_update() into check() and commit()

Due to the upcoming atomic modesetting feature we need to separate
some update functions into a check step that can fail and a commit
step that should, ideally, never fail.

The commit part can still fail, but that should be solved in another
upcoming patch.
