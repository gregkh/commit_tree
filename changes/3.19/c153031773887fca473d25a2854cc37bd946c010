amd-xgbe: Associate Tx SKB with proper ring descriptor

The SKB for a Tx packet is associated with an xgbe_ring_data structure
in the xgbe_map_tx_skb function.  However, it is being saved in the
structure after the last structure used when the SKB is mapped.  Use
the last used structure to save the SKB value.
