PCI: designware: Reject MSI-X IRQs

The DesignWare PCIe MSI hardware does not support MSI-X IRQs.  Setting
those up failed as a side effect of a bug which was fixed by 91f8ae823f2b
("PCI: designware: Setup and clear exactly one MSI at a time").

Now that this bug is fixed, MSI-X IRQs need to be rejected explicitly;
otherwise devices trying to use them may end up with incorrectly working
interrupts.
