openvswitch: packet messages need their own probe attribtue

User space is currently sending a OVS_FLOW_ATTR_PROBE for both flow
and packet messages. This leads to an out-of-bounds access in
ovs_packet_cmd_execute() because OVS_FLOW_ATTR_PROBE >
OVS_PACKET_ATTR_MAX.

Introduce a new OVS_PACKET_ATTR_PROBE with the same numeric value
as OVS_FLOW_ATTR_PROBE to grow the range of accepted packet attributes
while maintaining to be binary compatible with existing OVS binaries.

Fixes: 05da589 ("openvswitch: Add support for OVS_FLOW_ATTR_PROBE.")
