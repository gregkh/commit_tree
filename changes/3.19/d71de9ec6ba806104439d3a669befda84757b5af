virtio: core support for config generation

virtio 1.0 spec says:

Drivers MUST NOT assume reads from fields greater than 32 bits wide are
atomic, nor are reads from multiple fields: drivers SHOULD read device
configuration space fields like so:
	u32 before, after;
	do {
		before = get_config_generation(device);
		// read config entry/entries.
		after = get_config_generation(device);
	} while (after != before);

Do exactly this, for transports that support it.
