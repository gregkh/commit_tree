drm/i915: Skip .get_backlight() when backlight isn't enabled

On VLV/CHV when the display is off, we can't read out the current
backlight level from the hardware since we have no pipe to do so.
Currently we end up reading a bigus register due to passing
INVALID_PIPE to VLV_BLC_PWM_CTL().

Skip the entire .get_backlight() call if the backlight isn't enabled
according to backlight.enabled.

This problem can be reproduced simply by reading the backlight device
actual_brightness file while the display is off.
