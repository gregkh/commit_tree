Bluetooth: Fix setting state back to TASK_RUNNING

In __hci_cmd_sync_ev() and __hci_req_sync() if the hci_req_run() call
fails and we return from the functions we should ensure that the state
doesn't remain in TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE that we just set it to. This patch
fixes missing calls to set_current_state(TASK_RUNNING) in both places.
