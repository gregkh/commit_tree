drm/tegra: gem: dumb: pitch and size are outputs

When creating a dumb buffer object using the DRM_IOCTL_MODE_CREATE_DUMB
IOCTL, only the width, height, bpp and flags parameters are inputs. The
caller is not guaranteed to zero out or set handle, pitch and size, so
the driver must not treat these values as possible inputs.

Fixes a bug where running the Weston compositor on Tegra DRM would cause
an attempt to allocate a 3 GiB framebuffer to be allocated.
