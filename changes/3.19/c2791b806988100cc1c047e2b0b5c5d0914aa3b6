PCI/MSI: Rename "struct msi_chip" to "struct msi_controller"

"msi_chip" isn't very descriptive, so rename it to "msi_controller".  That
tells a little more about what it does and is already used in device tree
bindings.

No functional change.

[bhelgaas: changelog, change *only* the struct name so it's reviewable]
