vhost: relax used address alignment

virtio 1.0 only requires used address to be 4 byte aligned,
vhost required 8 bytes (size of vring_used_elem).
Fix up vhost to match that.

Additionally, while vhost correctly requires 8 byte
alignment for log, it's unconnected to used ring:
it's a consequence that log has u64 entries.
Tweak code to make that clearer.
