Revert "mac80211: Fix accounting of the tailroom-needed counter"

This reverts commit ca34e3b5c808385b175650605faa29e71e91991b.

It turns out that the p54 and cw2100 drivers assume that there's
tailroom even when they don't say they really need it. However,
there's currently no way for them to explicitly say they do need
it, so for now revert this.

This fixes https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=90331.
