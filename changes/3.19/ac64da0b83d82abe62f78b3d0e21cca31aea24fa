net: rps: fix cpu unplug

softnet_data.input_pkt_queue is protected by a spinlock that
we must hold when transferring packets from victim queue to an active
one. This is because other cpus could still be trying to enqueue packets
into victim queue.

A second problem is that when we transfert the NAPI poll_list from
victim to current cpu, we absolutely need to special case the percpu
backlog, because we do not want to add complex locking to protect
process_queue : Only owner cpu is allowed to manipulate it, unless cpu
is offline.

Based on initial patch from Prasad Sodagudi & Subash Abhinov
Kasiviswanathan.

This version is better because we do not slow down packet processing,
only make migration safer.
