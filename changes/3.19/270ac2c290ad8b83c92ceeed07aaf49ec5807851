ncr5380: Remove NCR5380_STATS

The NCR5380_STATS option is only enabled by g_NCR5380 yet it adds
clutter to all three core drivers. The atari_NCR5380.c and sun3_NCR5380.c
core drivers have a slightly different implementation of the
NCR5380_STATS option.

Out of all ten NCR5380 drivers, only one of them (g_NCR5380) actually
has the code to report on the collected stats. Aside from being unreadable,
that code seems to be broken because there's no initialization of timebase.
sun3_NCR5380.c and atari_NCR5380.c have the timebase initialization but
lack the code to report the stats.

Remove all of this code to improve readability and reduce divergence
between the three core drivers.

This patch and the next one completely eliminate the PRINTP and ANDP
pre-processor abuse.
