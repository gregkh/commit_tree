Input: gpio_keys - replace timer and workqueue with delayed workqueue

We do not need to roll our own implementation of delayed work now that we
have proper implementation of mod_delayed_work.

For interrupt-only driven buttons we retain the timer, but we rename
it to release_timer to better reflect its purpose.
