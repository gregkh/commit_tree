arm/arm64: KVM: Add (new) vgic_initialized macro

Some code paths will need to check to see if the internal state of the
vgic has been initialized (such as when creating new VCPUs), so
introduce such a macro that checks the nr_cpus field which is set when
the vgic has been initialized.

Also set nr_cpus = 0 in kvm_vgic_destroy, because the error path in
vgic_init() will call this function, and code should never errornously
assume the vgic to be properly initialized after an error.
