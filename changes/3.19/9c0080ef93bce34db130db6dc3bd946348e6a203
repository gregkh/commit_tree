x86/vdso: Make the PER_CPU segment start out accessed

The first userspace attempt to read or write the PER_CPU segment
will write the accessed bit to the GDT.  This is visible to
userspace using the LAR instruction, and it also pointlessly
dirties a cache line.

Set the segment's accessed bit at boot to prevent userspace
access to segments from having side effects.
