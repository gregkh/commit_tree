ALSA: ak411x: Fix stall in work callback

When ak4114 work calls its callback and the callback invokes
ak4114_reinit(), it stalls due to flush_delayed_work().  For avoiding
this, control the reentrance by introducing a refcount.  Also
flush_delayed_work() is replaced with cancel_delayed_work_sync().

The exactly same bug is present in ak4113.c and fixed as well.
