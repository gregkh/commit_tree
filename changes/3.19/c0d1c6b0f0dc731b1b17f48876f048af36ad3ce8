serial: imx: Fix the reporting of interrupts

On a imx system with ttymxc0, ttymxc1 and ttymxc4 registered we see the
following output from 'cat /proc/interrupts':

$ cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
...
 58:         39       GIC  58  2020000.serial
 67:        115       GIC  67  21f8000.i2c

The only uart irq that appears is ttymxc0, which is the console.

As ttymxc1 and ttymxc4 will only have their irq registered at imx_startup(),
they are not shown right after probe.

Transmitting to ttymxc1 and ttymxc4 will cause their irqs to be registered, but
the output shows:

$ echo "111111" > /dev/ttymxc1
$ echo "444444" > /dev/ttymxc4
$ cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
...
 58:        150       GIC  58  2020000.serial
 59:          1       GIC  59
 62:          1       GIC  62
 67:        115       GIC  67  21f8000.i2c

,which misses printing the associated device address.

In order to fix this, register all the irqs inside the probe function via
devm_request_irq(), which will correctly report the serial interrupts associated
with their correspondent serial device and also helps simplyfing the code by
avoiding the calls to free_irq().

$ echo "111111" > /dev/ttymxc1
$ echo "444444" > /dev/ttymxc4
$ cat /proc/interrupts

	   CPU0
....
 58:        202       GIC  58  2020000.serial
 59:          1       GIC  59  21e8000.serial
 62:          1       GIC  62  21f4000.serial
 67:        115       GIC  67  21f8000.i2c
