arm: perf: fold hotplug notifier into arm_pmu

Handling multiple PMUs using a single hotplug notifier requires a list
of PMUs to be maintained, with synchronisation in the probe, remove, and
notify paths. This is error-prone and makes the code much harder to
maintain.

Instead of using a single notifier, we can dynamically allocate a
notifier block per-PMU. The end result is the same, but the list of PMUs
is implicit in the hotplug notifier list rather than within a perf-local
data structure, which makes the code far easier to handle.
