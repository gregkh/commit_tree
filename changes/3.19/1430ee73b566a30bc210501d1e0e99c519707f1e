HID: logitech-hidpp: check name retrieval return code

hidpp_devicenametype_get_device_name() may return a negative value on
protocol errors (for example, when the device is powered off).
Explicitly check this condition to avoid a long-running loop.

(0 cannot be returned as __name_length - index > 0, but check for it
anyway as it would otherwise result in an infinite loop.)
