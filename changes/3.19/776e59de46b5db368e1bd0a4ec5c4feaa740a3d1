mac802154: set extended address filter on ifup

This patch moves the setting of hardware extended address filtering
inside of interface up instead doing it directly inside of netlink interface.
Also we don't need to set the sdata extended attribute in netlink. This
is already done by ndo_set_mac_address of net_device_ops.
