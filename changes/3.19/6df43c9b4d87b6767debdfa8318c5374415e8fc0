drivers/base: cacheinfo: remove noisy error boot message

On systems that don't support cacheinfo, this error message can be
considered noisy and irrelevant. The error messages can be added to
the functions that architectures implement overiding the weak default
definition if really required.

This patch removes the concerned error message in the generic code.
