zfcp: remove access control tables interface (port leftovers)

This patch removes some leftovers for commit
663e0890e31cb85f0cca5ac1faaee0d2d52880b5
"[SCSI] zfcp: remove access control tables interface".

The "access denied" case for ports is gone, as well.
The corresponding flag was cleared, but never set.
So clean it up.

Sysfs flag is kept, though, for backward-compatibility.
Now it returns always 0.
