KVM: s390: sigp: move target cpu checks into dispatcher

All sigp orders targeting one VCPU have to verify that the target is valid and
available.

Let's move the check from the single functions to the dispatcher. The
destination VCPU is directly passed as a pointer - instead of the cpu address of
the target.

Please note that all SIGP orders except SIGP SET ARCHITECTURE - even unknown
ones - will now check for the availability of the target VCPU. This is what the
architecture documentation specifies.
