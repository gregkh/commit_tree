iwlwifi: mvm: add SSID match information for net-detect

Add SSID information to the net-detect indication to userspace.  Fetch
the matched profiles from the firmware in order to find the correct
SSIDs in the profiles that matched.

Since the net-detect information is stored in cfg80211, and in theory
it could change while we are waking up and reading the matched
profiles, we need to save it when we enter D3 so it is available
during resume.
