x86/asm: Guard against building the 32/64-bit versions of the asm-offsets*.c file directly

Sometimes it is helpful to build a kernel compilation unit
directly, i.e.:

  make .../<filename>.i

in order to look at compiler output.

Since asm-offsets_{32,64}.c are included by asm-offsets.c and
building them directly doesn't evaluate the macros used (thus
making the preprocessor output not very useful), error out when
an attempt is made to build them. Issue a hint for the user to
build asm-offsets.c instead.
