ovs: Turn vports with dependencies into separate modules

The internal and netdev vport remain part of openvswitch.ko. Encap
vports including vxlan, gre, and geneve can be built as separate
modules and are loaded on demand. Modules can be unloaded after use.
Datapath ports keep a reference to the vport module during their
lifetime.

Allows to remove the error prone maintenance of the global list
vport_ops_list.
