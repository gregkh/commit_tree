ath10k: apply chainmask settings to vdev on creation

It appears it takes more than just setting the
hardware's chainmask to make things work well.  Without
this patch, a vdev would only use 1x1 rates when chainmask
was set to 0x3.

Setting the 'nss' (number of spatial streams) on the vdev
helps the firmware's rate-control algorithm work properly.
