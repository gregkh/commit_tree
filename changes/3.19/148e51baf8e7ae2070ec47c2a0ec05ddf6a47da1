dm: improve documentation and code clarity in dm_merge_bvec

These code changes do not introduce a functional change.

But bio_add_page() will never attempt to build up a bio larger than
queue_max_sectors().  Similarly, bio_get_nr_vecs() is also bound by
queue_max_sectors().  Therefore, there is no point in allowing
dm_merge_bvec() to answer "how many sectors can a bio have at this
offset?" with anything larger than queue_max_sectors().  Using
queue_max_sectors() rather than BIO_MAX_SECTORS serves to more
accurately convey the limits that are being imposed.

Also, use unlikely() to clarify the fact that the defensive code in
dm_merge_bvec() relative to max_size going negative shouldn't ever
happen -- if it does happen there is a bug in the block layer for
requesting larger than dm_merge_bvec()'s initial response for a given
offset.  Also, update a comment in dm_merge_bvec() relative to
max_hw_sectors_kb.  And fix empty newline whitespace.
