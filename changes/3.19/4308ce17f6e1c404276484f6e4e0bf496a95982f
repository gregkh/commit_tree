mm/memblock.c: refactor functions to set/clear MEMBLOCK_HOTPLUG

There is a lot of duplication in the rubric around actually setting or
clearing a mem region flag.  Create a new helper function to do this and
reduce each of memblock_mark_hotplug() and memblock_clear_hotplug() to a
single line.

This will be useful if someone were to add a new mem region flag - which
I hope to be doing some day soon. But it looks like a plausible cleanup
even without that - so I'd like to get it out of the way now.
