rcu: Remove "cpu" argument to rcu_needs_cpu()

The "cpu" argument to rcu_needs_cpu() is always the current CPU, so drop
it.  This in turn allows the "cpu" argument to rcu_cpu_has_callbacks()
to be removed, which allows the uses of "cpu" in both functions to be
replaced with a this_cpu_ptr().  Again, the anticipated cross-CPU uses
of these functions has been replaced by NO_HZ_FULL.
