[media] m88ds3103: add support for the demod of M88RS6000

M88RS6000 is the integrated chip, which includes tuner and demod. Its
internal demod is similar with M88DS3103 except some registers
definition.

The main different part of this internal demod from others is its
clock/pll generation IP block sitting inside the tuner die. So clock/pll
functions should be configed through its tuner i2c bus, NOT its demod
i2c bus.

The demod of M88RS6000 need the firmware: dvb-demod-m88rs6000.fw
