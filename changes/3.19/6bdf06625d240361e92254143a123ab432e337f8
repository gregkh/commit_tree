KVM: x86: DR7.GD should be cleared upon any #DB exception

Intel SDM 17.2.4 (Debug Control Register (DR7)) says: "The processor clears the
GD flag upon entering to the debug exception handler." This sentence may be
misunderstood as if it happens only on #DB due to debug-register protection,
but it happens regardless to the cause of the #DB.

Fix the behavior to match both real hardware and Bochs.
