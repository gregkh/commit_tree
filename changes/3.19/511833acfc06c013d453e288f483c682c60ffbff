SCSI: fix regression in scsi_send_eh_cmnd()

Commit ac61d1955934 (scsi: set correct completion code in
scsi_send_eh_cmnd()) introduced a bug.  It changed the stored return
value from a queuecommand call, but it didn't take into account that
the return value was used again later on.  This patch fixes the bug by
changing the later usage.

There is a big comment in the middle of scsi_send_eh_cmnd() which
does a good job of explaining how the routine works.  But it mentions
a "rtn = FAILURE" value that doesn't exist in the code.  This patch
adjusts the code to match the comment (I assume the comment is right
and the code is wrong).

This fixes Bugzilla #88341.
