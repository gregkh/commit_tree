spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Remove usage of devm_kzalloc

devm_* API was supposed to be used only in probe function call.
Memory is allocated at 'probe' and free automatically at 'remove'.
Usage of devm_* functions outside probe sometimes leads to memory leak.
Avoid using devm_kzalloc in dspi_setup_transfer and use kzalloc instead.
Also add the dspi_cleanup function to free the controller data upon
cleanup.
