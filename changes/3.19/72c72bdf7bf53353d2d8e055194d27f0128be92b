VFS: Rename do_fallocate() to vfs_fallocate()

This function needs to be exported so it can be used by the NFSD module
when responding to the new ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE operations in NFS
v4.2.  Christoph Hellwig suggested renaming the function to stay
consistent with how other vfs functions are named.
