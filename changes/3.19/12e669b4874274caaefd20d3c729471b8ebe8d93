ARM: 8237/1: fix flush_pfn_alias

L1_CACHE_BYTES could be larger than real L1 cache line size.
In that case, flush_pfn_alias() would omit to flush last bytes
as much as L1_CACHE_BYTES - real cache line size.

So fix end address to "to + PAGE_SIZE - 1". The bottom bits of the address
is LINELEN. that is ignored by mcrr.
