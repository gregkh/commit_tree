mtd: update help of CONFIG_MTD_OF_PARTS

The help text of CONFIG_MTD_OF_PARTS refers to additional documentation
in booting-without-of.txt but this documentation was moved to another
file in commit efcc2da3fd148c9acb7d7cf1d9800e0649f950fc (Stefan Roese:
Factor MTD physmap bindings out of booting-without-of). This updates the
help text to point to the right place.
