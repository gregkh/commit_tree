ACPI / table: Add new function to get table entries

The acpi_table_parse() function has a callback that
passes a pointer to a table_header. Add a new function
which takes this pointer and parses its entries. This
eliminates the need to re-traverse all the tables for
each call. e.g. as in acpi_table_parse_madt() which is
normally called after acpi_table_parse().
