PM: Merge the SET*_RUNTIME_PM_OPS() macros

The SET_PM_RUNTIME_PM_OPS() and SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS() macros are
identical except that one of them is not empty for CONFIG_PM set,
while the other one is not empty for CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME set,
respectively.

However, after commit b2b49ccbdd54 (PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if
PM_SLEEP is selected) PM_RUNTIME is always set if PM is set, so one
of these macros is now redundant.

For this reason, replace SET_PM_RUNTIME_PM_OPS() with
SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS() everywhere and redefine the SET_PM_RUNTIME_PM_OPS
symbol as SET_RUNTIME_PM_OPS in case new code is starting to use the
macro being removed here.
