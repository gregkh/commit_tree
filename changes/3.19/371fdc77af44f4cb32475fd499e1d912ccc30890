kbuild: collect shorthands into scripts/Kbuild.include

The shorthand "clean" is defined in both the top Makefile and
scripts/Makefile.clean.  Likewise, the "hdr-inst" is defined in
both the top Makefile and scripts/Makefile.headersinst.

To reduce code duplication, this commit collects them into
scripts/Kbuild.include like the "build" and "modbuiltin" shorthands.
It requires scripts/Makefile.clean to include scripts/Kbuild.include,
but its impact on the performance of "make clean" should be
negligible.
