can: kvaser_usb: Send correct context to URB completion

Send expected argument to the URB completion hander: a CAN
netdevice instead of the network interface private context
`kvaser_usb_net_priv'.

This was discovered by having some garbage in the kernel
log in place of the netdevice names: can0 and can1.
