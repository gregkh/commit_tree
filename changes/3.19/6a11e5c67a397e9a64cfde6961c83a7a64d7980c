drivers/char/ipmi: Add powernv IPMI driver

This change adds an initial IPMI driver for powerpc OPAL firmware. The
interface is exposed entirely through firmware: we have two functions to
send and receive IPMI messages, and an interrupt notification from the
firmware to signify that a message is available.
