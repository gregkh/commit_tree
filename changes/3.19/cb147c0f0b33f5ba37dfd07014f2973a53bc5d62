m32r: io: implement dummy relaxed accessor macros for writes

write{b,w,l}_relaxed are implemented by some architectures in order to
permit memory-mapped I/O accesses with weaker barrier semantics than the
non-relaxed variants.

This patch adds dummy macros for the write accessors to m32r, in the
same vein as the dummy definitions for the relaxed read accessors.
