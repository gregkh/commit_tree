rcu: Remove rcu_dynticks * parameters when they are always this_cpu_ptr(&rcu_dynticks)

For some functions in kernel/rcu/tree* the rdtp parameter is always
this_cpu_ptr(rdtp).  Remove the parameter if constant and calculate the
pointer in function.

This will have the advantage that it is obvious that the address are
all per cpu offsets and thus it will enable the use of this_cpu_ops in
the future.
