kgdb: timeout if secondary CPUs ignore the roundup

Currently if an active CPU fails to respond to a roundup request the CPU
that requested the roundup will become stuck.  This needlessly reduces the
robustness of the debugger.

This patch introduces a timeout allowing the system state to be examined
even when the system contains unresponsive processors.  It also modifies
kdb's cpu command to make it censor attempts to switch to unresponsive
processors and to report their state as (D)ead.
