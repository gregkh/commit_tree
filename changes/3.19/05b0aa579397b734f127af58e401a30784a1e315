tg3: tg3_disable_ints using uninitialized mailbox value to disable interrupts

During driver load in tg3_init_one, if the driver detects DMA activity before
intializing the chip tg3_halt is called. As part of tg3_halt interrupts are
disabled using routine tg3_disable_ints. This routine was using mailbox value
which was not initialized (default value is 0). As a result driver was writing
0x00000001 to pci config space register 0, which is the vendor id / device id.

This driver bug was exposed because of the commit a7877b17a667 (PCI: Check only
the Vendor ID to identify Configuration Request Retry). Also this issue is only
seen in older generation chipsets like 5722 because config space write to offset
0 from driver is possible. The newer generation chips ignore writes to offset 0.
Also without commit a7877b17a667, for these older chips when a GRC reset is
issued the Bootcode would reprogram the vendor id/device id, which is the reason
this bug was masked earlier.

Fixed by initializing the interrupt mailbox registers before calling tg3_halt.

Please queue for -stable.
