drm/dsi: Make mipi_dsi_dcs_{read,write}() symmetrical

Currently the mipi_dsi_dcs_write() function requires the DCS command
byte to be embedded within the write buffer whereas mipi_dsi_dcs_read()
has a separate parameter. Make them more symmetrical by adding an extra
command parameter to mipi_dsi_dcs_write().

The S6E8AA0 driver relies on the old asymmetric API and there's concern
that moving to the new API may be less efficient. Provide a new function
with the old semantics for those cases and make the S6E8AA0 driver use
it instead.
