ALSA: hda - Add quirk for Packard Bell EasyNote MX65

Packard Bell EasyNote MX65 with AD1986A codec needs a few fixups,
namely, the pin config overrides to set only the known I/O pins and
the EAPD has to be turned on.  In addition, add stereo mix input
forcibly for avoiding the weird KDE behavior by this update.
