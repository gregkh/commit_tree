usb: dwc3: gadget: WARN() on bogus usb_ep_queue()

Some gadget/function drivers might want to do
improper request recycling by allocating a single
request from one particular endpoint and queueing
it to another completely unrelated endpoint.

One such case was found with f_loopback.c.

To prevent such cases from happening again, let's
WARN() so we get a loud enough failure and persuade
users to report errors.
