ASoC: max98090: Fix digital microphone

Commit e409dfbfccf9 ("ASoC: dapm: Add a few supply widget sanity checks")
broke digital microphone support in max98090.c:

max98090 i2c-193C9890:00: Conditional paths are not supported for supply widgets (DMICL_ENA -> [DMIC] -> DMIC Mux)
max98090 i2c-193C9890:00: ASoC: no dapm match for DMICL_ENA --> DMIC --> DMIC Mux
max98090 i2c-193C9890:00: ASoC: Failed to add route DMICL_ENA -> DMIC -> DMIC Mux
max98090 i2c-193C9890:00: Conditional paths are not supported for supply widgets (DMICR_ENA -> [DMIC] -> DMIC Mux)
max98090 i2c-193C9890:00: ASoC: no dapm match for DMICR_ENA --> DMIC --> DMIC Mux
max98090 i2c-193C9890:00: ASoC: Failed to add route DMICR_ENA -> DMIC -> DMIC Mux

Problem is partially caused by commit f69e3caa9e18 ("ASoC: max98090: Enable
both DMIC channels also when using mono configuration") which connects
"DMICL_ENA" and "DMICR_ENA" supply widgets to "DMIC Mux".

Fix the breakage by reverting f69e3caa9e18 and then by adding additional
"DMICR_ENA" to "DMICL" and "DMICL_ENA" to "DMICR" cross-connections. This
disconnects these supply widgets from the mux and makes sure that both DMIC
data channels are still enabled together.
