bridge: only provide proxy ARP when CONFIG_INET is enabled

When IPV4 support is disabled, we cannot call arp_send from
the bridge code, which would result in a kernel link error:

net/built-in.o: In function `br_handle_frame_finish':
:(.text+0x59914): undefined reference to `arp_send'
:(.text+0x59a50): undefined reference to `arp_tbl'

This makes the newly added proxy ARP support in the bridge
code depend on the CONFIG_INET symbol and lets the compiler
optimize the code out to avoid the link error.
