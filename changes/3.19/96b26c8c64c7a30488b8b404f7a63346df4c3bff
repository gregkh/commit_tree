dm: fix handling of multiple internal suspends

Commit ffcc393641 ("dm: enhance internal suspend and resume interface")
attempted to handle multiple internal suspends on the same device, but
it did that incorrectly.  When these functions are called in this order
on the same device the device is no longer suspended, but it should be:
	dm_internal_suspend_noflush
	dm_internal_suspend_noflush
	dm_internal_resume

Fix this bug by maintaining an 'internal_suspend_count' and resuming
the device when this count drops to zero.
