mm: move swp_entry_t definition to include/linux/mm_types.h

swp_entry_t being defined in include/linux/swap.h instead of
include/linux/mm_types.h causes cyclic include dependency later when
include/linux/page_cgroup.h is included from writeback path.  Move the
definition to include/linux/mm_types.h.

While at it, reformat the comment above it.
