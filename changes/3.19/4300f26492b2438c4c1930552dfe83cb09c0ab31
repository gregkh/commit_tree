tools: hv: ignore ENOBUFS and ENOMEM in the KVP daemon

Under high memory pressure and very high KVP R/W test pressure, the netlink
recvfrom() may transiently return ENOBUFS to the daemon -- we found this
during a 2-week stress test.

We'd better not terminate the daemon on the failure, because a typical KVP
user will re-try the R/W and hopefully it will succeed next time.

We can also ignore the errors on sending.
