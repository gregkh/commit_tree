mfd: core: Add helper function to register hotplug devices

Hot-pluggable multi-function devices should always be registered with
PLATFORM_DEVID_AUTO to avoid name collisions on the platform bus. This
helper also hides the memory map and irq parameters, which aren't used
by hot-pluggable (e.g. USB-based) devices.
