thermal: rockchip: add driver for thermal

Thermal is TS-ADC Controller module supports
user-defined mode and automatic mode.

User-defined mode refers,TSADC all the control signals entirely by
software writing to register for direct control.

Automaic mode refers to the module automatically poll TSADC output,
and the results were checked.If you find that the temperature High
in a period of time,an interrupt is generated to the processor
down-measures taken;If the temperature over a period of time High,
the resulting TSHUT gave CRU module,let it reset the entire chip,
or via GPIO give PMIC.
