perf session: Do not fail on processing out of order event

Linus reported perf report command being interrupted due to processing
of 'out of order' event, with following error:

  Timestamp below last timeslice flush
  0x5733a8 [0x28]: failed to process type: 3

I could reproduce the issue and in my case it was caused by one CPU
(mmap) being behind during record and userspace mmap reader seeing the
data after other CPUs data were already stored.

This is expected under some circumstances because we need to limit the
number of events that we queue for reordering when we receive a
PERF_RECORD_FINISHED_ROUND or when we force flush due to memory
pressure.
