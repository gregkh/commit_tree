Btrfs: don't ignore compressed bio write errors

Our compressed bio write end callback was essentially ignoring the error
parameter. When a write error happens, it must pass a value of 0 to the
inode's write_page_end_io_hook callback, SetPageError on the respective
pages and set AS_EIO in the inode's mapping flags, so that a call to
filemap_fdatawait_range() / filemap_fdatawait() can find out that errors
happened (we surely don't want silent failures on fsync for example).
