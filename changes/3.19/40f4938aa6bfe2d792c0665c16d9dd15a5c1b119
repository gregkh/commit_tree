Bluetooth: Consolidate whitelist debugfs entry into device_list

The debufs entry for the BR/EDR whitelist is confusing since there is
a controller debugfs entry with the name white_list and both are two
different things.

With the BR/EDR whitelist, the actual interface in use is the device
list and thus just include all values from the internal BR/EDR whitelist
in the device_list debugfs entry.
