i2c: omap: implement workaround for handling invalid BB-bit values

In a multimaster environment, after IP software reset, BB-bit value doesn't
correspond to the current bus state. It may happen what BB-bit will be 0,
while the bus is busy due to another I2C master activity.

Any transfer started when BB=0 and bus is busy wouldn't be completed by IP
and results in controller timeout. More over, in some cases IP could
interrupt another master's transfer and corrupt data on wire.

The commit implement method allowing to prevent IP from entering into
"controller timeout" state and from "data corruption" state.

The one drawback is the need to wait for 10ms before the first transfer.
