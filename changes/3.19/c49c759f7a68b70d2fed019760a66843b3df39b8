KVM: x86: Emulator performs code segment checks on read access

When read access is performed using a readable code segment, the "conforming"
and "non-conforming" checks should not be done.  As a result, read using
non-conforming readable code segment fails.

This is according to Intel SDM 5.6.1 ("Accessing Data in Code Segments").

The fix is not to perform the "non-conforming" checks if the access is not a
fetch; the relevant checks are already done when loading the segment.
