Btrfs: don't take the chunk_mutex/dev_list mutex in statfs V2

Our gluster boxes get several thousand statfs() calls per second, which begins
to suck hardcore with all of the lock contention on the chunk mutex and dev list
mutex.  We don't really need to hold these things, if we have transient
weirdness with statfs() because of the chunk allocator we don't care, so remove
this locking.

We still need the dev_list lock if you mount with -o alloc_start however, which
is a good argument for nuking that thing from orbit, but that's a patch for
another day.  Thanks,
