ipv4: Avoid reading user iov twice after raw_probe_proto_opt

Ever since raw_probe_proto_opt was added it had the problem of
causing the user iov to be read twice, once during the probe for
the protocol header and once again in ip_append_data.

This is a potential security problem since it means that whatever
we're probing may be invalid.  This patch plugs the hole by
firstly advancing the iov so we don't read the same spot again,
and secondly saving what we read the first time around for use
by ip_append_data.
