arm: mvebu: define and use common Armada XP SPI pinctrl setting

This patch defines common Armada XP pinctrl settings in armada-xp.dtsi
for the supported SPI interface (MPP36-39) and use it as default
for Armada XP spi interface. That being done, it removes the now
redundant definitions in armada-xp-axpwifiap.dts.

Note: this patch has the potential to break out-of-tree users w/o
specific pinctrl settings for their spi interfaces if the default
above does not match their config (i.e. if they do not use CS0).
