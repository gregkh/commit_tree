rtlwifi: rtl8192ce: Fix kernel crashes due to missing callback entry

In the major update of the rtlwifi-family of drivers, one of the callback entries
was missed, which leads to memory corruption. Unfortunately, this corruption
never caused a kernel oops, but showed up in other parts of the system.
This patch is one of three needed to fix the kernel regression reported at
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=88951.
