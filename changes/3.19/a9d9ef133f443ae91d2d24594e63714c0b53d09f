binfmt_elf: load interpreter program headers earlier

Load the program headers of an ELF interpreter early enough in
load_elf_binary that they can be examined before it's too late to return
an error from an exec syscall. This patch does not perform any such
checking, it merely lays the groundwork for a further patch to do so.

No functional change is intended.
