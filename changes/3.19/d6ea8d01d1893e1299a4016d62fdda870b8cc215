topology: replace custom attribute macros with standard DEVICE_ATTR*

Currently couple of custom macros are defined to declare the
device attributes. However there are already standard macros
defined in device.h that suffice the need and these custom
macros can be removed.

This patch replaces custom attribute macros with standard
DEVICE_ATTR_RO attribute
