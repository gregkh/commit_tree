xen/pci: Defer initialization of MSI ops on HVM guests

If the hardware supports APIC virtualization we may decide not to use
pirqs and instead use APIC/x2APIC directly, meaning that we don't want
to set x86_msi.setup_msi_irqs and x86_msi.teardown_msi_irq to
Xen-specific routines.  However, x2APIC is not set up by the time
pci_xen_hvm_init() is called so we need to postpone setting these ops
until later, when we know which APIC mode is used.

(Note that currently x2APIC is never initialized on HVM guests. This
may change in the future)
