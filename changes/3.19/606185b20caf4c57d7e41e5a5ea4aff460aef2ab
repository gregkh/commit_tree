HID: roccat: potential out of bounds in pyra_sysfs_write_settings()

This is a static checker fix.  We write some binary settings to the
sysfs file.  One of the settings is the "->startup_profile".  There
isn't any checking to make sure it fits into the
pyra->profile_settings[] array in the profile_activated() function.

I added a check to pyra_sysfs_write_settings() in both places because
I wasn't positive that the other callers were correct.
