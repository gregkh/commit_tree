drm/i915: Fix Sink CRC

In some cases like when PSR just got enabled the panel need more vblank
times to calculate CRC. I figured that out with the new PSR test cases
facing some cases that I had a green screen but a blank CRC. Even with
2 vblank waits on kernel + 2 vblank waits on test case.

So let's give up to 6 vblank wait time. However we now check for
TEST_CRC_COUNT that shows when panel finished to calculate CRC and
has it ready.

v2: Jani pointed out attempts decrements was wrong and should never reach
the error condition. And Daniel pointed out that EIO is more appropriated than
EGAIN. Also I realized that I have to read test_crc_count after setting
test_sink

v3: Rebase and adding error message
