uml: Fix unsafe pid reference to foreground process group

Although the tty core maintains a pid reference for the foreground
process group, if the foreground process group is changed that
pid reference is dropped. Thus, the pid reference used for signalling
could become stale.

Safely obtain a pid reference to the foreground process group and
release the reference after signalling is complete.
