tun: return NET_XMIT_DROP for dropped packets

After commit 5d097109257c03a71845729f8db6b5770c4bbedc
("tun: only queue packets on device"), NETDEV_TX_OK was returned for
dropped packets. This will confuse pktgen since dropped packets were
counted as sent ones.

Fixing this by returning NET_XMIT_DROP to let pktgen count it as error
packet.
