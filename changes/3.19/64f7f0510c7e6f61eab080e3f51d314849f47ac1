vhost: switch to __get/__put_user exclusively

Most places in vhost can use __get/__put_user rather than
get/put_user since addresses are pre-validated.
This should be good for performance, but this also
will help make code sparse-clean: get/put_user macros
don't play well with __virtioXX bitwise tags.
Switch to get/put_user to __ variants everywhere in vhost.
There's one exception - for consistency switch that
as well, and add an explicit access_ok check.
