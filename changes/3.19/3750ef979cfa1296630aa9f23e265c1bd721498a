exit: reparent: s/while_each_thread/for_each_thread/ in find_new_reaper()

Change find_new_reaper() to use for_each_thread() instead of deprecated
while_each_thread().  We do not bother to check "thread != father" in the
1st loop, we can rely on PF_EXITING check.

Note: this means the minor behavioural change: for_each_thread() starts
from the group leader.  But this should be fine, nobody should make any
assumption about do_wait(__WNOTHREAD) when it comes to reparented tasks.
And this can avoid the pointless reparenting to a short-living thread
While zombie leaders are not that common.
