drivers: cpuidle: Add status property to ARM idle states

On some platforms the device tree bindings must provide the kernel
with a status flag for idle states, that defines whether the idle
state is operational or not in the current configuration.

This patch adds a status property to the ARM idle states compliant
with ePAPR v1.1 and updates the DT parsing code accordingly.
