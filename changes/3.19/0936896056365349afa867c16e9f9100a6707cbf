fs: sysfs: return EGBIG on write if offset is larger than file size

According to the user expectations common utilities like dd or sh
redirection operator > should work correctly over binary files from
sysfs. At the moment doing excessive write can not be completed:

  write(1, "\0\0\0\0\0\0\0\0", 8)         = 4
  write(1, "\0\0\0\0", 4)                 = 0
  write(1, "\0\0\0\0", 4)                 = 0
  write(1, "\0\0\0\0", 4)                 = 0
  ...

Fix the problem by returning EFBIG described in man 2 write.
