ARM: 8204/1: Add unwinding support for memset function

The memset function never had unwinding annotations added.
Currently, when accessing NULL pointer by memset occurs the
backtrace shown will stop at memset or some completely unrelated
function. Add unwinding annotations in hopes of getting a more
useful backtrace when accessing NULL pointer by memset, kprobe
or interrupt.
