tty: serial: 8250_omap: add custom DMA-RX callback

The omap needs a DMA request pending right away. If it is
enqueued once the bytes are in the FIFO then nothing will happen
and the FIFO will be later purged via RX-timeout interrupt.
This patch enqueues RX-DMA request on completion but not if it
was aborted on error. The first enqueue will happen in the driver
in startup.
