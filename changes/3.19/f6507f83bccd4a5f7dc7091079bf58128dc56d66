exit: wait: cleanup the ptrace_reparented() checks

Now that EXIT_DEAD is the terminal state we can kill "int traced"
variable and check "state == EXIT_DEAD" instead to cleanup the code.  In
particular, this way it is clear that the check obviously doesn't need
tasklist_lock.

Also fix the type of "unsigned long state", "long" was always wrong
although this doesn't matter because cmpxchg/xchg uses typeof(*ptr).
