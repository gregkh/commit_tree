hpsa: always call pci_set_master after pci_enable_device

If the kernel is booted with the reset_device parameter, which
is done for kdump, then the driver needs to call pci_set_master
after pci_enable_device to reenable bus mastering (since
the preceding pci_disable_device call disables bus mastering).

Also, place that after pci_request_regions both in the
kdump code and the normal pci_init code.

Remove the comment summarizing what pci_set_master
does, with the incomplete commentary on the impact of
pci_disable_device.
