net/mlx4_en: Extend checksum offloading by CHECKSUM COMPLETE

When processing received traffic, pass CHECKSUM_COMPLETE status to the
stack, with calculated checksum for non TCP/UDP packets (such
as GRE or ICMP).

Although the stack expects checksum which doesn't include the pseudo
header, the HW adds it. To address that, we are subtracting the pseudo
header checksum from the checksum value provided by the HW.

In the IPv6 case, we also compute/add the IP header checksum which
is not added by the HW for such packets.
