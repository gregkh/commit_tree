rcu: Remove "cpu" argument to rcu_note_context_switch()

The "cpu" argument to rcu_note_context_switch() is always the current
CPU, so drop it.  This in turn allows the "cpu" argument to
rcu_preempt_note_context_switch() to be removed, which allows the sole
use of "cpu" in both functions to be replaced with a this_cpu_ptr().
Again, the anticipated cross-CPU uses of these functions has been
replaced by NO_HZ_FULL.
