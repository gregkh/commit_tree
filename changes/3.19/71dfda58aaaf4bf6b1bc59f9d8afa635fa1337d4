net: Add device Rx page allocation function

This patch implements __dev_alloc_pages and __dev_alloc_page.  These are
meant to replace the __skb_alloc_pages and __skb_alloc_page functions.  The
reason for doing this is that it occurred to me that __skb_alloc_page is
supposed to be passed an sk_buff pointer, but it is NULL in all cases where
it is used.  Worse is that in the case of ixgbe it is passed NULL via the
sk_buff pointer in the rx_buffer info structure which means the compiler is
not correctly stripping it out.

The naming for these functions is based on dev_alloc_skb and __dev_alloc_skb.
There was originally a netdev_alloc_page, however that was passed a
net_device pointer and this function is not so I thought it best to follow
that naming scheme since that is the same difference between dev_alloc_skb
and netdev_alloc_skb.

In the case of anything greater than order 0 it is assumed that we want a
compound page so __GFP_COMP is set for all allocations as we expect a
compound page when assigning a page frag.

The other change in this patch is to exploit the behaviors of the page
allocator in how it handles flags.  So for example we can always set
__GFP_COMP and __GFP_MEMALLOC since they are ignored if they are not
applicable or are overridden by another flag.
