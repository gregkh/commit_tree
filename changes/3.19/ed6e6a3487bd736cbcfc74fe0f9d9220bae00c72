amdkfd: Add kernel queue module

The kernel queue module enables the amdkfd to establish kernel queues, not
exposed to user space.

The kernel queues are used for HIQ (HSA Interface Queue) and DIQ (Debug
Interface Queue) operations

v3: Removed use of internal typedefs and added use of the new gart allocation
functions

v4: Fixed a miscalculation in kernel queue wrapping

v5:

Move amdkfd from drm/radeon/ to drm/amd/
Change format of mqd structure to match latest KV firmware
Add support for AQL queues creation to enable working with open-source HSA
runtime
Add define for kernel queue size
Various fixes
