tipc: add sock dump to new netlink api

Add TIPC_NL_SOCK_GET command to the new tipc netlink API.

This command supports dumping of all available sockets with their
associated connection or publication(s). It could be extended to reply
with a single socket if the NLM_F_DUMP isn't set.

The information about a socket includes reference, address, connection
information / publication information.

Netlink logical layout of response message:
-> socket
    -> reference
    -> address
    [
    -> connection
        -> node
        -> socket
        [
        -> connected flag
        -> type
        -> instance
        ]
    ]
    [
    -> publication flag
    ]
