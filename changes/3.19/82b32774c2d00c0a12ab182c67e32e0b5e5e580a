KVM: x86: Breakpoints do not consider CS.base

x86 debug registers hold a linear address. Therefore, breakpoints detection
should consider CS.base, and check whether instruction linear address equals
(CS.base + RIP). This patch introduces a function to evaluate RIP linear
address and uses it for breakpoints detection.
