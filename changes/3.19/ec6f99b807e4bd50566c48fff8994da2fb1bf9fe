Bluetooth: Fix enabling BR/EDR SC when powering on

If we're in the AUTO_OFF stage the powered_update_hci() function is
responsible for doing the updates to the HCI state that were not done
during the actual mgmt command handlers. One of the updates needing done
is for BR/EDR SC support. This patch adds the missing HCI command for SC
support to the powered_update_hci() function.
