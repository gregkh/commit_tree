Staging: rtl8192e: Revert one previous commit

This patch reverts commit  450246465a76 ("Staging: rtl8192e:
Fix incorrect type in assignment in rtl819x_BAProc.c") as it is
changing code and introducing bug to skip the endian conversion.
Here, tmp variable is used to hold the endian-corrected values
and network-data requires fixed endianness.
