rtc: refine rtc_timer_do_work() to consider other set alarm failures

rtc_timer_do_work() only judges -ETIME failure of__rtc_set_alarm(), but
doesn't handle other failures like -EIO, -EBUSY, etc.

If there is a failure other than -ETIME, the next rtc_timer will stay in
the timerqueue.  Then later rtc_timers will be enqueued directly because
they have a later expires time, so the alarm irq will never be programmed.

When such failures happen, this patch will retry __rtc_set_alarm(), if
still can't program the alarm time, it will remove current rtc_timer from
timerqueue and fetch next one, thus preventing it from affecting other rtc
timers.
