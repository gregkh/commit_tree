SUNRPC: serialize iostats updates

Occasionally mountstats reports a negative retransmission rate.
Ensure that two RPCs completing concurrently don't confuse the sums
in the transport's op_metrics array.

Since pNFS filelayout can invoke rpc_count_iostats() on another
transport from xprt_release(), we can't rely on simply holding the
transport_lock in xprt_release(). There's nothing for it but hard
serialization. One spin lock per RPC operation should make this as
painless as it can be.
