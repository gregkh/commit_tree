i2c-hid / PM: Replace CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME with CONFIG_PM

After commit b2b49ccbdd54 (PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if PM_SLEEP is
selected) PM_RUNTIME is always set if PM is set, so #ifdef blocks
depending on CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME may now be changed to depend on
CONFIG_PM.

Replace CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME with CONFIG_PM in drivers/hid/i2c-hid/i2c-hid.c.
