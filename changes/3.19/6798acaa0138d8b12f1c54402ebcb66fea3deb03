gpio: fix sleep-while-atomic in gpiochip_remove

Move direct and indirect calls to gpiochip_remove_pin_ranges outside of
spin lock as they can end up taking a mutex in pinctrl_remove_gpio_range.

Note that the pin ranges are already added outside of the lock.

Fixes: f23f1516b675 ("gpiolib: provide provision to register pin ranges")
