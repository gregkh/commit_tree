brcmfmac: fix static checker warning in pmklist handling

The patch fixes a static checker warning:

   drivers/net/wireless/brcm80211/brcmfmac/cfg80211.c:2965
      brcmf_cfg80211_set_pmksa()
	warn: can 'pmkid_len' be negative?

The answer to the question above is likely no so changing its
type to unsigned is sufficient.
