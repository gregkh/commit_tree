[media] coda: allow userspace to set compressed buffer size in a certain range

For small frame sizes, allocating 1 MiB per compressed buffer is a waste of
space. On the other hand, incompressible 1080p data can produce JPEGs larger
than 1 MiB at higher quality settings. Allow userspace to set the compressed
buffer size and clamp the value to a sensible range.
Also set the initial sizeimage to a value inside the range allowed by try_fmt.
While at it, reduce the default image size to a maximum of 1920*1088 (otherwise
JPEG will default to 8k*8k and 96 MiB buffers).
