perf/x86/intel/uncore: Make sure only uncore events are collected

The uncore_collect_events functions assumes that event group
might contain only uncore events which is wrong, because it
might contain any type of events.

This bug leads to uncore framework touching 'not' uncore events,
which could end up all sorts of bugs.

One was triggered by Vince's perf fuzzer, when the uncore code
touched breakpoint event private event space as if it was uncore
event and caused BUG:

   BUG: unable to handle kernel paging request at ffffffff82822068
   IP: [<ffffffff81020338>] uncore_assign_events+0x188/0x250
   ...

The code in uncore_assign_events() function was looking for
event->hw.idx data while the event was initialized as a
breakpoint with different members in event->hw union.

This patch forces uncore_collect_events() to collect only uncore
events.
