coresight: add CoreSight core layer framework

CoreSight components are compliant with the ARM CoreSight
architecture specification and can be connected in various
topologies to suit a particular SoC tracing needs. These trace
components can generally be classified as sources, links and
sinks. Trace data produced by one or more sources flows through
the intermediate links connecting the source to the currently
selected sink.

The CoreSight framework provides an interface for the CoreSight trace
drivers to register themselves with. It's intended to build up a
topological view of the CoreSight components and configure the
correct serie of components on user input via sysfs.

For eg., when enabling a source, the framework builds up a path
consisting of all the components connecting the source to the
currently selected sink(s) and enables all of them.

The framework also supports switching between available sinks
and provides status information to user space applications
through the debugfs interface.
