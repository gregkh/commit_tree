sunvnet: Remove irqsave/irqrestore on vio.lock

After the  NAPIfication of sunvnet, we no longer need to
synchronize by doing irqsave/restore on vio.lock in the
I/O fastpath.

NAPI ->poll() is non-reentrant, so all RX processing occurs
strictly in a serialized environment. TX reclaim is done in NAPI
context, so the netif_tx_lock can be used to serialize
critical sections between Tx and Rx paths.
