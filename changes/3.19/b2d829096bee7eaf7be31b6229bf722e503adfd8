workqueue: invert the order between pool->lock and wq_mayday_lock

Currently, pool->lock nests inside pool->lock.  There's no inherent
reason for this order.  The only place where the two locks are held
together is pool_mayday_timeout() and it just got decided that way.

This nesting order turns out to complicate things with the planned
rescuer_thread() update.  Let's invert them.  This doesn't cause any
behavior differences.
