HID: i2c-hid: prevent buffer overflow in early IRQ

Before ->start() is called, bufsize size is set to HID_MIN_BUFFER_SIZE,
64 bytes. While processing the IRQ, we were asking to receive up to
wMaxInputLength bytes, which can be bigger than 64 bytes.

Later, when ->start is run, a proper bufsize will be calculated.

Given wMaxInputLength is said to be unreliable in other part of the
code, set to receive only what we can even if it results in truncated
reports.
