net: sctp: fix passing wrong parameter header to param_type2af in sctp_process_param

When making use of RFC5061, section 4.2.4. for setting the primary IP
address, we're passing a wrong parameter header to param_type2af(),
resulting always in NULL being returned.

At this point, param.p points to a sctp_addip_param struct, containing
a sctp_paramhdr (type = 0xc004, length = var), and crr_id as a correlation
id. Followed by that, as also presented in RFC5061 section 4.2.4., comes
the actual sctp_addr_param, which also contains a sctp_paramhdr, but
this time with the correct type SCTP_PARAM_IPV{4,6}_ADDRESS that
param_type2af() can make use of. Since we already hold a pointer to
addr_param from previous line, just reuse it for param_type2af().
