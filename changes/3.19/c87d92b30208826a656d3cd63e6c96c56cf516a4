HID: lenovo: Don't set EV_REP to avoid repeating mice buttons

On the USB keyboard, the VENDOR hotkeys share the same device as the
mouse. Setting EV_REP also affects mouse buttons, so leave it off.

The bluetooth keyboard still has autorepeating mouse buttons, as it
only has one device and is set by the KEYBOARD pages.
