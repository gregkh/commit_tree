drm/i915/skl: Use correct use counters for force wakes

Write and reads following the block changed use engine specific use counters
and unless that is matched here force wake use counting goes bad. Same
force wake is attempted to be taken twice which leads to at least time outs.

NOTE: Depending on feedback from hardware designers it may not be necessary
to grab force wakes on Gen9 here. But for Gen8 it is needed due to a race
between RC6 and ELSP writes.

v2: Added blitter force wake engine and made more future proof.
    Added commit note.
