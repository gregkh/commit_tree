net/mlx4: Cache line CQE/EQE stride fixes

This commit contains 2 fixes for the 128B CQE/EQE stride feaure.
Wei found that mlx4_QUERY_HCA function marked the wrong capability
in flags (64B CQE/EQE), when CQE/EQE stride feature was enabled.
Also added small fix in initial CQE ownership bit assignment, when CQE
is size is not default 32B.
