USB: EHCI: fix initialization bug in iso_stream_schedule()

Commit c3ee9b76aa93 (EHCI: improved logic for isochronous scheduling)
introduced the idea of using ehci->last_iso_frame as the origin (or
base) for the circular calculations involved in modifying the
isochronous schedule.  However, the new code it added used
ehci->last_iso_frame before the value was properly initialized.  This
patch rectifies the mistake by moving the initialization lines earlier
in iso_stream_schedule().

This fixes Bugzilla #72891.
