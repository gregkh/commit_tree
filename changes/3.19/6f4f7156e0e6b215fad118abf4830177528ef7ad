ARM: shmobile: henninger: enable HS-USB

Enable HS-USB device for the Henninger board, defining the GPIO that the driver
should check when probing (which is the ID output from MAX3355 OTG chip).

Note that there will be pinctrl-related error messages if both internal PCI
and HS-USB drivers are enabled but they should be just ignored.
