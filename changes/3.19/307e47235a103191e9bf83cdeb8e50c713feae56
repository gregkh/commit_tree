iwlwifi: mvm: configure TDLS peers to FW

Send a dedicated TDLS_CONFIG command when a TDLS peer joins/leaves. The
fields for the command are mostly place-holders, as most of the FW
functionality is not implemented. In the future the dedicated FW TID
will be used for channel-switching and buffer-sta functionality.
