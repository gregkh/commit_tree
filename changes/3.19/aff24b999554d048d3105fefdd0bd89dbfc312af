staging: comedi: addi_apci_1564: board does not use an AMCC PCI controller

According to ADDI-DATA, the APCI-1564 board has a FPGA with a PCI core, it
does not use an AMCC PCI controller chip.

Remove the amcc_s5933.h include as well as the read of the AMCC_OP_REG_INTCSR
register. That offset would actually read APCI1564_WDOG_STATUS_REG register
in the FPGA which has nothing to do with the interrupt status.
