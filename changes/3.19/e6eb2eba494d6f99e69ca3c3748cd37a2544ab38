powerpc/xmon: Fix another endiannes issue in RTAS call from xmon

The commit 3b8a3c010969 ("powerpc/pseries: Fix endiannes issue in RTAS
call from xmon") was fixing an endianness issue in the call made from
xmon to RTAS.

However, as Michael Ellerman noticed, this fix was not complete, the
token value was not byte swapped. This lead to call an unexpected and
most of the time unexisting RTAS function, which is silently ignored by
RTAS.

This fix addresses this hole.
