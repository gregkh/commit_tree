powerpc: Convert power off logic to pm_power_off

The generic Linux framework to power off the machine is a function pointer
called pm_power_off. The trick about this pointer is that device drivers can
potentially implement it rather than board files.

Today on powerpc we set pm_power_off to invoke our generic full machine power
off logic which then calls ppc_md.power_off to invoke machine specific power
off.

However, when we want to add a power off GPIO via the "gpio-poweroff" driver,
this card house falls apart. That driver only registers itself if pm_power_off
is NULL to ensure it doesn't override board specific logic. However, since we
always set pm_power_off to the generic power off logic (which will just not
power off the machine if no ppc_md.power_off call is implemented), we can't
implement power off via the generic GPIO power off driver.

To fix this up, let's get rid of the ppc_md.power_off logic and just always use
pm_power_off as was intended. Then individual drivers such as the GPIO power off
driver can implement power off logic via that function pointer.

With this patch set applied and a few patches on top of QEMU that implement a
power off GPIO on the virt e500 machine, I can successfully turn off my virtual
machine after halt.
