isdn: off by one in connect_res()

The bug here is that we use "Reject" as the index into the cau_t[] array
in the else path.  Since the cau_t[] has 9 elements if Reject == 9 then
we are reading beyond the end of the array.

My understanding of the code is that it's saying that if Reject is 1 or
too high then that's invalid and we should hang up.
