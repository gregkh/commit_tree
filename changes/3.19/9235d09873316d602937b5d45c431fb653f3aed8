Convert MessageID in smb2_hdr to LE

We have encountered failures when When testing smb2 mounts on ppc64
machines when using both Samba as well as Windows 2012.

On poking around, the problem was determined to be caused by the
high endian MessageID passed in the header for smb2. On checking the
corresponding MID for smb1 is converted to LE before being sent on the
wire.

We have tested this patch successfully on a ppc64 machine.
