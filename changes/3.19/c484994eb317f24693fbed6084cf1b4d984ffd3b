Altera TSE: Add missing phydev

Altera network device doesn't come up after

ifconfig eth0 down
ifconfig eth0 up

The reason behind is clearing priv->phydev during tse_shutdown().
The phydev is not restored back at tse_open().

Resubmiting as to follow Tobias Klauser suggestion.
phy_start/phy_stop are called on each ifup/ifdown and
phy_disconnect is called once during the module removal.
