xen: Delay m2p_override initialization

The m2p overrides are used to be able to find the local pfn for a
foreign mfn mapped into the domain. They are used by driver backends
having to access frontend data.

As this functionality isn't used in early boot it makes no sense to
initialize the m2p override functions very early. It can be done
later without doing any harm, removing the need for allocating memory
via extend_brk().

While at it make some m2p override functions static as they are only
used internally.
