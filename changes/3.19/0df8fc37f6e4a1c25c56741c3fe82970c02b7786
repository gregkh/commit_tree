usb: phy: never defer probe in non-OF case

In practice failure to find phy when requested in non-OF
case means it will never become available, so
__usb_find_phy() must return -ENODEV and not -EPROBE_DEFER.

This fixes a regression caused by commit 9c9d82492b73
(usb: phy: Fix deferred probing), where the USB
controller driver is left infinitely into deferred probe
when there are no phys.
