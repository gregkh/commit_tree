libata: allow sata_sil24 to opt-out of tag ordered submission

Ronny reports: https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=87101
    "Since commit 8a4aeec8d "libata/ahci: accommodate tag ordered
    controllers" the access to the harddisk on the first SATA-port is
    failing on its first access. The access to the harddisk on the
    second port is working normal.

    When reverting the above commit, access to both harddisks is working
    fine again."

Maintain tag ordered submission as the default, but allow sata_sil24 to
continue with the old behavior.
