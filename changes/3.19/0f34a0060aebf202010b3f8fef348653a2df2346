ima: check ima_policy_flag in the ima_file_free() hook

This patch completes the switching to the 'ima_policy_flag' variable
in the checks at the beginning of IMA functions, starting with the
commit a756024e.

Checking 'iint_initialized' is completely unnecessary, because
S_IMA flag is unset if iint was not allocated. At the same time
the integrity cache is allocated with SLAB_PANIC and the kernel will
panic if the allocation fails during kernel initialization. So on
a running system iint_initialized is always true and can be removed.

Changes in v3:
* not limiting test to IMA_APPRAISE (spotted by Roberto Sassu)

Changes in v2:
* 'iint_initialized' removal patch merged to this patch (requested
   by Mimi)
