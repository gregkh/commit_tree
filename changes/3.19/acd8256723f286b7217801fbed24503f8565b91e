iio: inkern: Add of_xlate function to struct iio_info

When #iio-cells is greater than '0', the driver could provide
a custom of_xlate function that reads the *args* and returns
the appropriate index in registered IIO channels array.

Add simple translation function, suitable for the most 1:1
mapped channels in IIO chips, and use it when driver did not
provide custom implementation.
