serial_core: Handle TIOC[GS]RS485 ioctls.

The following drivers: 8250_core, atmel_serial, max310x, mcf, omap-serial
and sci16is7xx implement code to handle RS485 ioctls.

In order to avoid code duplication, we implement a simple ioctl handler
on the serial_core layer.

This handler can be used by all the other drivers instead of duplicating
code.

Until this is the only RS485 ioctl handler, it will try first the
rs485_config callback and if it is not present it will call the driver
specific ioctl.
