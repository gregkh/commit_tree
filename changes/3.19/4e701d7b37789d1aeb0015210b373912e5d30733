memcg: only check memcg_kmem_skip_account in __memcg_kmem_get_cache

__memcg_kmem_get_cache can recurse if it calls kmalloc (which it does if
the cgroup's kmem cache doesn't exist), because kmalloc may call
__memcg_kmem_get_cache internally again.  To avoid the recursion, we use
the task_struct->memcg_kmem_skip_account flag.

However, there's no need checking the flag in memcg_kmem_newpage_charge,
because there's no way how this function could result in recursion, if
called from memcg_kmem_get_cache.  So let's remove the redundant code.
