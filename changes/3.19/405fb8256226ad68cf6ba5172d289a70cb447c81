thermal: cpu_cooling: Don't match min/max frequencies for all CPUs on cooling register

In __cpufreq_cooling_register() we try to match min/max frequencies for all CPUs
passed in 'clip_cpus' mask. This mask is the cpumask of cpus where the frequency
constraints will be applied.

Same frequency constraint can be applied only to the CPUs belonging to the same
cluster (i.e. CPUs sharing clock line). For all such CPUs we have a single
'struct cpufreq_policy' structure managing them and so getting policies for all
CPUs wouldn't make any sense as they will all return the same pointer.

So, remove this useless check of checking min/max for all CPUs. Also update doc
comment to make this more obvious that clip_cpus should be same as
policy->related_cpus.
