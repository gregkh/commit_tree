xen/pciback: Don't deadlock when unbinding.

As commit 0a9fd0152929db372ff61b0d6c280fdd34ae8bdb
'xen/pciback: Document the entry points for 'pcistub_put_pci_dev''
explained there are four entry points in this function.
Two of them are when the user fiddles in the SysFS to
unbind a device which might be in use by a guest or not.

Both 'unbind' states will cause a deadlock as the the PCI lock has
already been taken, which then pci_device_reset tries to take.

We can simplify this by requiring that all callers of
pcistub_put_pci_dev MUST hold the device lock. And then
we can just call the lockless version of pci_device_reset.

To make it even simpler we will modify xen_pcibk_release_pci_dev
to quality whether it should take a lock or not - as it ends
up calling xen_pcibk_release_pci_dev and needs to hold the lock.
