[media] bq/c-qcam, w9966, pms: move to staging in preparation for removal

These drivers haven't been tested in a long, long time. The hardware is
ancient and hopelessly obsolete. These drivers also need to be converted
to newer media frameworks but due to the lack of hardware that's going
to be impossible. In addition, cheaper and vastly better hardware is
available today.

So these drivers are a prime candidate for removal. If someone is
interested in working on these drivers to prevent their removal, then
please contact the linux-media mailinglist.

Let's be honest, the age of parallel port webcams and ISA video capture
boards is really gone.
