Revert "blk-mq: Micro-optimize bt_get()"

This reverts commit 52f7eb945f2ba62b324bb9ae16d945326a961dcf.

The optimization is only really safe for a single queue, otherwise
'bs' and 'bt' can indeed change, and if we don't do a finish_wait()
for each loop, we'll potentially change the wait structure and
corrupt task wait list.
