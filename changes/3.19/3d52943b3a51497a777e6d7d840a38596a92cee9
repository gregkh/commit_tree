drivers: base: add cpu_device_create to support per-cpu devices

This patch adds a new function to create per-cpu devices.
This helps in:
1. reusing the device infrastructure to create any cpu related
   attributes and corresponding sysfs instead of creating and
   dealing with raw kobjects directly
2. retaining the legacy path(/sys/devices/system/cpu/..) to support
   existing sysfs ABI
3. avoiding to create links in the bus directory pointing to the
   device as there would be per-cpu instance of these devices with
   the same name since dev->bus is not populated to cpu_sysbus on
   purpose
