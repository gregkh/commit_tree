block: wake up waiters when a queue is marked dying

If it's dying, we can't expect new request to complete and come
in an wake up other tasks waiting for requests. So after we
have marked it as dying, wake up everybody currently waiting
for a request. Once they wake, they will retry their allocation
and fail appropriately due to the state of the queue.
