drivers/rtc/rtc-sirfsoc.c: move hardware initilization earlier in probe

Move rtc register to be later than hardware initialization.  The reason
is that devm_rtc_device_register() will do read_time() which is a
callback accessing hardware.  This sometimes causes a hang in the
hardware related callback.
