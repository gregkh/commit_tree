Revert "usb: chipidea: remove duplicate dev_set_drvdata for host_start"

This reverts commit 14b4099c074f2ddf4d84b22d370170e61b527529

It moved platform_set_drvdata(pdev, ci) before hcd is created,
and the hcd will assign itself as ci controller's drvdata during
the hcd creation function (in usb_create_shared_hcd), so it
overwrites the real ci's drvdata which we want to use.

So, if the controller is at host mode, the system suspend
API will get the wrong struct ci_hdrc pointer, and cause the
oops.
