ACPI / property: Drop size_prop from acpi_dev_get_property_reference()

The size_prop argument of the recently added function
acpi_dev_get_property_reference() is not used by the only current
caller of that function and is very unlikely to be used at any time
going forward.

Namely, for a property whose value is a list of items each containing
a references to a device object possibly accompanied by some integers,
the number of items in the list can always be computed as the number
of elements of type ACPI_TYPE_LOCAL_REFERENCE in the property package.
Thus it should never be necessary to provide an additional "cells"
property with a value equal to the number of items in that list.  It
also should never be necessary to provide a "cells" property specifying
how many integers are supposed to be following each reference.

For this reason, drop the size_prop argument from
acpi_dev_get_property_reference() and update its caller accordingly.
