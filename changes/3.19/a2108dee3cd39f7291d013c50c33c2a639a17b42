phy: miphy28lp: Add SSC support for PCIE

SSC is the technique of modulating the operating frequency of a signal
slightly to spread its radiated emissions over a range of frequencies.
This reduction in the maximum emission for a given frequency helps meet
radiated emission requirements.
These settings are applicable for PCIE with Internal clock.
