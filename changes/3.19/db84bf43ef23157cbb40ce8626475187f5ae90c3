tg3: tg3_reset_task() needs to use rtnl_lock to synchronize

Currently tg3_reset_task() uses only tp->lock for synchronizing with code
paths like tg3_open() etc. But since tp->lock is released before doing
synchronize_irq(), rtnl_lock should be taken in tg3_reset_task() to
synchronize it with other code paths.
