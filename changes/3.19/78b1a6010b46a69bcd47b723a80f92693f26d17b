drm/radeon: Use cursor_set2 hook for enabling / disabling the HW cursor

The cursor_set2 hook provides the cursor hotspot position within the
cursor image. When the hotspot position changes, we can adjust the cursor
position such that the hotspot doesn't move on the screen. This prevents
the cursor from appearing to intermittently jump around on the screen
when the position of the hotspot within the cursor image changes.
