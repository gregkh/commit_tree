PCI: Add flag for devices where we can't use bus reset

Enable a mechanism for devices to quirk that they do not behave when
doing a PCI bus reset.  We require a modest level of spec compliant
behavior in order to do a reset, for instance the device should come
out of reset without throwing errors and PCI config space should be
accessible after reset.  This is too much to ask for some devices.
