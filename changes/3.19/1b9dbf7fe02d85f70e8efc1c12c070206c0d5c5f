NVMe: Add revalidate_disk callback

This adds a callback to revalidate the disk and change its block size
and capacity if needed. Before, a user would have to remove + rescan
an entire device if they changed the logical block size using an NVMe
Format or other vendor specific command; now they can just run something
that issues the BLKRRPART IOCTL, like

 # hdparm -z /dev/nvmeXnY

This can also be used in response to the 1.2 Spec's Namespace Attribute
Change asynchronous event.
