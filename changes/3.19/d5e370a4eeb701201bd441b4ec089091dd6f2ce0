tty: Don't release tty locks for wait queue sanity check

Releasing the tty locks while waiting for the tty wait queues to
be empty is no longer necessary nor desirable. Prior to
"tty: Don't take tty_mutex for tty count changes", dropping the
tty locks was necessary to reestablish the correct lock order between
tty_mutex and the tty locks. Dropping the global tty_mutex was necessary;
otherwise new ttys could not have been opened while waiting.

However, without needing the global tty_mutex held, the tty locks for
the releasing tty can now be held through the sleep. The sanity check
is for abnormal conditions caused by kernel bugs, not for recoverable
errors caused by misbehaving userspace; dropping the tty locks only
allows the tty state to get more sideways.
