Add flow control support flags to gianfar's capabilities

The phy device supports 802.3x flow control, but the specific flags are not set
in the phy initialisation code. Flow control flags need to be added to the
supported capabilities of the phydev by the driver.

This is needed in order for ethtool to work ('ethtool -A' code checks for these
flags)
