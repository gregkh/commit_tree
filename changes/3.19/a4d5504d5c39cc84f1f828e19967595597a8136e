Bluetooth: Clear LE white list when resetting controller

The internal representation of the LE white list needs to be cleared
when receiving a successful HCI_Reset command. A reset of the controller
is expected to start with an empty LE white list.

When the LE white list is not cleared on controller reset, the passive
background scanning might skip programming the remote devices. Only
changes to the LE white list are programmed when passive background
is started.
