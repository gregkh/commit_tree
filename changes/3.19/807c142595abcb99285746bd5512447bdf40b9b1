KVM: x86: SYSCALL cannot clear eflags[1]

SYSCALL emulation currently clears in 64-bit mode eflags according to
MSR_SYSCALL_MASK.  However, on bare-metal eflags[1] which is fixed to one
cannot be cleared, even if MSR_SYSCALL_MASK masks the bit.  This wrong behavior
may result in failed VM-entry, as VT disallows entry with eflags[1] cleared.

This patch sets the bit after masking eflags on syscall.
