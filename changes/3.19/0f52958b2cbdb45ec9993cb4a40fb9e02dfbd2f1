i40e: init NVM update state on adminq init

The adminq init is run after the EMPR that is triggered by the
NVM update.  The final write command will cause the reset and
will want to wait for the ARQ event that signals the end of the
update, but the reset precludes the event being sent.  The state
is probably already at INIT, but we set it so here anyway, and
clear the release_on_done flag as well.
