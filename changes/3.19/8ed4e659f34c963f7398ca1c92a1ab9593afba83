iwlwifi: mvm: add channel information to the netdetect notifications

Add the channels on which there was a match for every match reported
by the firmware.  The firmware reports the channels as indices to the
array of channels that was passed in the scheduled scan request, so we
need to save the array when entering D3 to make sure it is available
when we resume.
