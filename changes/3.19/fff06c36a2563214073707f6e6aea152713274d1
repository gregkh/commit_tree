openvswitch: Optimize recirc action.

OVS need to flow key for flow lookup in recic action. OVS
does key extract in recic action. Most of cases we could
use OVS_CB packet key directly and can avoid packet flow key
extract. SET action we can update flow-key along with packet
to keep it consistent. But there are some action like MPLS
pop which forces OVS to do flow-extract. In such cases we
can mark flow key as invalid so that subsequent recirc
action can do full flow extract.
