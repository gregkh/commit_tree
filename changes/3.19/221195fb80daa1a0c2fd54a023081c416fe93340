powerpc: Drop useless warning in eeh_init()

This is what we get in dmesg when booting a pseries guest and
the hypervisor doesn't provide EEH support.

[    0.166655] EEH functionality not supported
[    0.166778] eeh_init: Failed to call platform init function (-22)

Since both powernv_eeh_init() and pseries_eeh_init() already complain when
hitting an error, it is not needed to print more (especially such an
uninformative message).
