gpio: fix memory leak and sleep-while-atomic

Fix memory leak and sleep-while-atomic in gpiochip_remove.

The memory leak was introduced by afa82fab5e13 ("gpio / ACPI: Move event
handling registration to gpiolib irqchip helpers") that moved the
release of acpi interrupt resources to gpiochip_irqchip_remove, but by
then the resources are no longer accessible as the acpi_gpio_chip has
already been freed by acpi_gpiochip_remove.

Note that this also fixes a few potential sleep-while-atomics, which has
been around since 1425052097b5 ("gpio: add IRQ chip helpers in gpiolib")
when the call to gpiochip_irqchip_remove while holding a spinlock was
added (a couple of irq-domain paths can end up grabbing mutexes).

Fixes: afa82fab5e13 ("gpio / ACPI: Move event handling registration to
gpiolib irqchip helpers")
