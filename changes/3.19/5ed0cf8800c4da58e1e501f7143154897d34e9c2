[media] m88ds3103: One function call less in m88ds3103_init() after error detection

GIT_AUTHOR_DATE=1416472158
The release_firmware() function was called in some cases by the
m88ds3103_init() function during error handling even if the passed variable
contained still a null pointer. This implementation detail could be improved
by the introduction of another jump label.
