drm: fix fb-helper vs MST dangling connector ptrs (v2)

VT switch back/forth from console to xserver (for example) has potential
to go horribly wrong if a dynamic DP MST connector ends up in the saved
modeset that is restored when switching back to fbcon.

When removing a dynamic connector, don't forget to clean up the saved
state.

v1: original
v2: null out set->fb if no more connectors to avoid making i915 cranky
