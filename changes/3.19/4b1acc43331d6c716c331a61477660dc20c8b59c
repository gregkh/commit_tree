i2c: core changes for slave support

Finally(!), make Linux support being an I2C slave. Most of the existing
infrastructure is reused. We mainly add i2c_slave_register/unregister()
calls which tells i2c bus drivers to activate the slave mode. Then, they
also get a callback to report slave events to.
