signal: Exit RCU read-side critical section on each pass through loop

The kill_pid_info() can potentially loop indefinitely if tasks are created
and deleted sufficiently quickly, and if this happens, this function
will remain in a single RCU read-side critical section indefinitely.
This commit therefore exits the RCU read-side critical section on each
pass through the loop.  Because a race must happen to retry the loop,
this should have no performance impact in the common case.
