rpc: fix xdr_truncate_encode to handle buffer ending on page boundary

A struct xdr_stream at a page boundary might point to the end of one
page or the beginning of the next, but xdr_truncate_encode isn't
prepared to handle the former.

This can cause corruption of NFSv4 READDIR replies in the case that a
readdir entry that would have exceeded the client's dircount/maxcount
limit would have ended exactly on a 4k page boundary.  You're more
likely to hit this case on large directories.

Other xdr_truncate_encode callers are probably also affected.
