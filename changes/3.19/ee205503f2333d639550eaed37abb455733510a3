perf tools: Fix annotation with kcore

Patch "perf tools: Fix build-id matching on vmlinux" breaks annotation
with kcore.  The problem is that symbol__annotate() first gets the
filename based on the build-id which was previously not set.

This patch provides a quick fix, however there should probably be only
one way to determine the filename. e.g.  symbol__annotate() should use
the same way as dso__data_fd().
