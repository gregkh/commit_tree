KVM: x86: No error-code on real-mode exceptions

Real-mode exceptions do not deliver error code. As can be seen in Intel SDM
volume 2, real-mode exceptions do not have parentheses, which indicate
error-code.  To avoid significant changes of the code, the error code is
"removed" during exception queueing.
