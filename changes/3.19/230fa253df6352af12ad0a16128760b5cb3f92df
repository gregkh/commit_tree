kernel: Provide READ_ONCE and ASSIGN_ONCE

ACCESS_ONCE does not work reliably on non-scalar types. For
example gcc 4.6 and 4.7 might remove the volatile tag for such
accesses during the SRA (scalar replacement of aggregates) step
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=58145)

Let's provide READ_ONCE/ASSIGN_ONCE that will do all accesses via
scalar types as suggested by Linus Torvalds. Accesses larger than
the machines word size cannot be guaranteed to be atomic. These
macros will use memcpy and emit a build warning.
