cfg80211: Fix 160 MHz channels with 80+80 and 160 MHz drivers

The VHT supported channel width field is a two bit integer, not a
bitfield. cfg80211_chandef_usable() was interpreting it incorrectly and
ended up rejecting 160 MHz channel width if the driver indicated support
for both 160 and 80+80 MHz channels.

Fixes: 3d9d1d6656a73 ("nl80211/cfg80211: support VHT channel configuration")
       (however, no real drivers had 160 MHz support it until 3.16)
