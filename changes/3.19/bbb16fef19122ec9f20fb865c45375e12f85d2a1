ACPI / Fan: Use bus id as the name for non PNP0C0B (Fan) devices

The _ART (Active Cooling Relationship Table), specifies relationship
among heat generating sources to a target active cooling device like
fan. The _ART table refers to actual bus id name for specifying relationship.
Naming "Fan" is not enough as name in the _ART table can change on every
platform, to establish relationship for user space thermal controllers.
