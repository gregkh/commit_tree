atari_NCR5380: Merge from sun3_NCR5380.c

There is very little difference between the sun3_NCR5380.c core driver
and atari_NCR5380.c. The former is a fork of the latter.

Merge the sun3_NCR5380.c core driver into atari_NCR5380.c so that
sun3_scsi.c can adopt the latter and the former can be deleted.
