net: wireless: rtlwifi: rtl8192ee: Fix compilation of the driver

In the Makefile for this driver, the wrong Kconfig option is used
to trigger the compilation of the object file. This leads to the
driver only being included into the kernel when both CONFIG_RTL8821AE
and CONFIG_RTL8192AE are set to "y".
