drm/i915: Request PIN_GLOBAL when pinning a vma for GTT relocations

Always require PIN_GLOBAL when we want a mappable offset (PIN_MAPPABLE).
This causes the pin to fixup the global binding in cases were the vma
was already bound (and due to the proceeding bug, we considered it to be
already mappable).
