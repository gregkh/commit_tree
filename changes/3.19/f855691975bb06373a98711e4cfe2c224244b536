xfrm6: Fix the nexthdr offset in _decode_session6.

xfrm_decode_session() was originally designed for the
usage in the receive path where the correct nexthdr offset
is stored in IP6CB(skb)->nhoff. Over time this function
spread to code that is used in the output path (netfilter,
vti) where IP6CB(skb)->nhoff is not set. As a result, we
get a wrong nexthdr and the upper layer flow informations
are wrong. This can leed to incorrect policy lookups.
