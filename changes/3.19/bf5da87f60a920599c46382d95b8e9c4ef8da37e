iwlwifi: mvm: add remove flow for AUX ROC time events

Add a flow that handles the requests to cancel the roc time event,
that has been triggered via the aux framework.

The roc for bss is different than the roc for p2p devices, and  is done
via the aux framework using the aux queue, thus requires a different flow
to cancel the time event.
