Fnic: Fnic Driver crashed with NULL pointer reference

When issuing I/O request, if the I/O completes before returning from
fnic_queuecommand(), we may be referencing scsi_cmnd structure that may
be freed by interrupt handler. Acquring IO lock would synchronize
fnic_queuecommand and interrupt handler.

- Increment fnic version from 1.6.0.15 to 1.6.0.16
