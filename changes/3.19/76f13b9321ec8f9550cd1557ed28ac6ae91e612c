ncr5380: Cleanup TAG_NEXT and TAG_NONE macros

Both atari_NCR5380.c and sun3_NCR5380.c core drivers #undef TAG_NONE and
then redefine it. But the original definition is unused because NCR5380.c
lacks support for tagged queueing. So just define it once.

The TAG_NEXT macro only appears in the arguments to NCR5380_select() calls.
But that routine doesn't use its tag argument as the tag was already
assigned in NCR5380_main(). So remove the unused argument and the macro.
