staging: unisys: refactor VISORCHIPSET_CHANNEL_INFO

Remove the typedef from this type and use struct visorchipset_channel_info
instead. Fix CamelCase member names:

addrType => addr_type
channelAddr => channel_addr
nChannelBytes => n_channel_bytes
channelTypeGuid => channel_type_uuid
channelInstGuid => channel_inst_uuid
