staging: unisys: refactor struct struct ultra_vbus_channel_protocol

Rename the struct to spar_vbus_channel_protocol. Fix CamelCase member names:

ChannelHeader => channel_header
HdrInfo => hdr_info
ChpInfo => chp_info
BusInfo => bus_info
DevInfo => dev_info

Update all references to use the changed names.
