ASoC: sgtl5000: Remove MCLK restriction

According to the sgtl5000 datasheet the MCLK frequency range restriction of
8 to 27 MHz only applies when the PLL is used - synchronous SYS_MCLK input mode.

When running the codec as slave, the master should generate MCLK in the range of
256*fs, 384*fs or 512*fs, which is called asynchronous SYS_MCLK input mode.

In asynchronous SYS_MCLK we cannot have the 8 to 27 MHz check because if we
want to play a 8KHz sample rate track, with a MCLK of 8k * 512 = 4.096MHz the
current check would return -EINVAL, which is not correct.

Remove the 8 to 27MHz frequency check, since this only applies to the
synchronous SYS_MCLK input case.
