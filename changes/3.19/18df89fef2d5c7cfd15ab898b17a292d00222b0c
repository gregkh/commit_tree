drm: Decouple EDID parsing from I2C adapter

The drm_get_edid() function performs direct I2C accesses to read EDID
blocks, assuming that the monitor DDC interface is directly connected to
the I2C bus. It can't thus be used with HDMI encoders that control the
DDC bus and expose EDID blocks through a different interface.

Refactor drm_do_get_edid() to take a block read callback function
instead of an I2C adapter, and export it for direct use by drivers.

As in the general case the DDC bus is accessible by the kernel at the
I2C level, drivers must make all reasonable efforts to expose it as an
I2C adapter and use drm_get_edid() instead of abusing this function.
