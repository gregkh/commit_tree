s390/scm_block: handle multiple requests in one HW request

Handle up to 8 block layer requests per HW request. These requests
can be processed in parallel on the device leading to better
throughput (and less interrupts). The overhead for additional
requests is small since we don't blindly allocate new aidaws but
try to use what's left of the previous one.
