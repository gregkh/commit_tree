quota: Use function to provide i_dquot pointers

i_dquot array is used by relatively few filesystems (ext?, ocfs2, jfs,
reiserfs) so it is beneficial to move this array to fs-private part of
the inode. We cannot just pass quota pointers from filesystems to quota
functions because during quotaon and quotaoff we have to traverse list
of all inodes and manipulate i_dquot pointers for each inode. So we
provide a function which generic quota code can use to get pointer to
the i_dquot array from the filesystem.
