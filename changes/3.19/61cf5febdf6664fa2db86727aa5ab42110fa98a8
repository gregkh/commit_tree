mm/page_owner: correct owner information for early allocated pages

Extended memory to store page owner information is initialized some time
later than that page allocator starts.  Until initialization, many pages
can be allocated and they have no owner information.  This make debugging
using page owner harder, so some fixup will be helpful.

This patch fixes up this situation by setting fake owner information
immediately after page extension is initialized.  Information doesn't tell
the right owner, but, at least, it can tell whether page is allocated or
not, more correctly.

On my testing, this patch catches 13343 early allocated pages, although
they are mostly allocated from page extension feature.  Anyway, after
then, there is no page left that it is allocated and has no page owner
flag.
