mm/zram: correct ZRAM_ZERO flag bit position

In struct zram_table_entry, the element *value* contains obj size and obj
zram flags.  Bit 0 to bit (ZRAM_FLAG_SHIFT - 1) represent obj size, and
bit ZRAM_FLAG_SHIFT to the highest bit of unsigned long represent obj
zram_flags.  So the first zram flag(ZRAM_ZERO) should be from
ZRAM_FLAG_SHIFT instead of (ZRAM_FLAG_SHIFT + 1).

This patch fixes this cosmetic issue.

Also fix a typo, "page in now accessed" -> "page is now accessed"
