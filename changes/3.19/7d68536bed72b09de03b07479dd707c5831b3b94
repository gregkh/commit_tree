netlink: call unbind when releasing socket

Currently, netlink_unbind() is only called when the socket
explicitly unbinds, which limits its usefulness (luckily
there are no users of it yet anyway.)

Call netlink_unbind() also when a socket is released, so it
becomes possible to track listeners with this callback and
without also implementing a netlink notifier (and checking
netlink_has_listeners() in there.)
