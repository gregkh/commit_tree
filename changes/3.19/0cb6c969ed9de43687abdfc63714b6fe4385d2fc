net, lib: kill arch_fast_hash library bits

As there are now no remaining users of arch_fast_hash(), lets kill
it entirely.

This basically reverts commit 71ae8aac3e19 ("lib: introduce arch
optimized hash library") and follow-up work, that is f.e., commit
237217546d44 ("lib: hash: follow-up fixups for arch hash"),
commit e3fec2f74f7f ("lib: Add missing arch generic-y entries for
asm-generic/hash.h") and last but not least commit 6a02652df511
("perf tools: Fix include for non x86 architectures").
