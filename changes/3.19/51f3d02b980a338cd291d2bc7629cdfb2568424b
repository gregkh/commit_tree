net: Add and use skb_copy_datagram_msg() helper.

This encapsulates all of the skb_copy_datagram_iovec() callers
with call argument signature "skb, offset, msghdr->msg_iov, length".

When we move to iov_iters in the networking, the iov_iter object will
sit in the msghdr.

Having a helper like this means there will be less places to touch
during that transformation.

Based upon descriptions and patch from Al Viro.
