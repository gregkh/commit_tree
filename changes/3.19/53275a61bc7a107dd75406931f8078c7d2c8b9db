devicetree: document ARM bindings for QEMU's Firmware Config interface

Peter Maydell suggested that we describe new devices / DTB nodes in the
kernel Documentation tree that we expose to arm "virt" guests in QEMU.

Although the kernel is not required to access the fw_cfg interface,
"Documentation/devicetree/bindings/arm" is probably the best central spot
to keep the fw_cfg description in.
