staging: unisys: refactor CONTROLVM_MESSAGE_PACKET

This patch refactors the message union and internal structures so they
will pass checkpatch.pl. The typedef is removed, and references are
changed to struct controlvm_message_packet. The comments were reflowed
and cleaned up to remove unnecessary information, and CamelCase member
names were fixed here and in references:

busNo => bus_no
devNo => dev_no
deviceCount => dev_count
channelAddr => channel_addr
channelBytes => channel_bytes
busDataTypeGuid => bus_data_type_uuid
busInstGuid => bus_inst_uuid
destroyBus => destroy_bus
guestHandle => guest_handle
recvBusInterruptHandle => recv_bus_irq_handle
configureBus => configure_bus
createDevuce => create_device
destroyDevice => destroy_device
configureDevice => configure_device
reconfigureDevice => reconfigure_device
busChangeState => bus_change_state
physicalDevice => phys_device
busCount => bus_count
switchCount => switch_count
platformNumber => platformNumber
initChipset => init_chipset
Options => options
Test => test
chipsetSelftest => chipset_selftest
