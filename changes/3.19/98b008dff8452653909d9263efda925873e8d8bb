perf/rapl: Fix crash in rapl_scale()

This patch fixes a systematic crash in rapl_scale()
due to an invalid pointer.

The bug was introduced by commit:

  89cbc76768c2 ("x86: Replace __get_cpu_var uses")

The fix is simple. Just put the parenthesis where it needs
to be, i.e., around rapl_pmu. To my surprise, the compiler
was not complaining about passing an integer instead of a
pointer.
