drm/i915: split intel_update_plane into check() and commit()

Due to the upcoming atomic modesetting feature we need to separate
some update functions into a check step that can fail and a commit
step that should, ideally, never fail.

This commit splits intel_update_plane() and its commit part can still
fail due to the fb pinning procedure.
