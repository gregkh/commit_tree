pstore/ram: Strip ramoops header for correct decompression

pstore compression/decompression was added during 3.12.
The ramoops driver prepends a "====timestamp.timestamp-C|D\n"
header to the compressed record before handing it over to pstore
driver which doesn't know about the header. In pstore_decompress(),
the pstore driver reads the first "==" as a zlib header, so the
decompression always fails. For example, this causes the driver
to write /dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.enc.z instead of
/dev/pstore/dmesg-ramoops-0.

This patch makes the ramoops driver remove the header before
pstore decompression.
