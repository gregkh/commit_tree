x86: Make page cache mode a real type

At the moment there are a lot of places that handle setting or getting
the page cache mode by treating the pgprot bits equal to the cache mode.
This is only true because there are a lot of assumptions about the setup
of the PAT MSR. Otherwise the cache type needs to get translated into
pgprot bits and vice versa.

This patch tries to prepare for that by introducing a separate type
for the cache mode and adding functions to translate between those and
pgprot values.

To avoid too much performance penalty the translation between cache mode
and pgprot values is done via tables which contain the relevant
information.  Write-back cache mode is hard-wired to be 0, all other
modes are configurable via those tables. For large pages there are
translation functions as the PAT bit is located at different positions
in the ptes of 4k and large pages.
