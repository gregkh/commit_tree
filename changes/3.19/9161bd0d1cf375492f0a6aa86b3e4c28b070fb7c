ALSA: echoaudio: cleanup of unnecessary messages

commit "b5b4a41b392960010fccf1f9ccf8334d612bd450" was dereferencing
chip after it has been freed. This patch fixes that and at the same
time removes some debugging messages, which are unnecessary, as they
are just printing information about entry and exit from a function,
and which switch-case it is executing.
we can easily get from ftrace the information about the entry and exit
from a function.
