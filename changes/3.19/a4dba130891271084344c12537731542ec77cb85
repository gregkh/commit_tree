xen/arm/arm64: introduce xen_arch_need_swiotlb

Introduce an arch specific function to find out whether a particular dma
mapping operation needs to bounce on the swiotlb buffer.

On ARM and ARM64, if the page involved is a foreign page and the device
is not coherent, we need to bounce because at unmap time we cannot
execute any required cache maintenance operations (we don't know how to
find the pfn from the mfn).

No change of behaviour for x86.
