usb: gadget: pxa27x_udc: transfer mach_info into pxa_udc

Convert the mach info, and store the udc_command in the pxa_udc control
structure.

It is to be noticed that the udc_is_connected() in mach info is not
transfered. This was not used, as mioa701 machine doesn't need it,
balloon3 doesn't really use it, and most importantly the current driver
never uses it.
