sched/deadline: Fix migration of SCHED_DEADLINE tasks

According to global EDF, tasks should be migrated between runqueues
without checking if their scheduling deadlines and runtimes are valid.
However, SCHED_DEADLINE currently performs such a check:
a migration happens doing:

	deactivate_task(rq, next_task, 0);
	set_task_cpu(next_task, later_rq->cpu);
	activate_task(later_rq, next_task, 0);

which ends up calling dequeue_task_dl(), setting the new CPU, and then
calling enqueue_task_dl().

enqueue_task_dl() then calls enqueue_dl_entity(), which calls
update_dl_entity(), which can modify scheduling deadline and runtime,
breaking global EDF scheduling.

As a result, some of the properties of global EDF are not respected:
for example, a taskset {(30, 80), (40, 80), (120, 170)} scheduled on
two cores can have unbounded response times for the third task even
if 30/80+40/80+120/170 = 1.5809 < 2

This can be fixed by invoking update_dl_entity() only in case of
wakeup, or if this is a new SCHED_DEADLINE task.
