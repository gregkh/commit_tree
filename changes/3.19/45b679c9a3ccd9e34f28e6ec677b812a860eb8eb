gianfar: Implement PAUSE frame generation support

The hardware can automatically generate pause frames when the number
of free buffers drops under a certain threshold, but in order to do this,
the address of the last free buffer needs to be written to a specific
register for each RX queue.

This has to be done in 'gfar_clean_rx_ring' which is called for each
RX queue. In order not to impact performance, by adding a register write
for each incoming packet, this operation is done only when the PAUSE frame
transmission is enabled.

Whenever the link is readjusted, this capability is turned on or off.
