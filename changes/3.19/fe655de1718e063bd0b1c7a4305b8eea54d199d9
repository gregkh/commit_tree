tty/serial: earlycon: Fix print for implied MMIO case

For the case in which we just provide an address as an argument to the
earlycon console type like:

earlycon=msm_serial_dm,0xf991e000

We would report this as an IO port based mapping and not as MMIO.  Simple
fix to use the port->iotype to decide which message to print.
