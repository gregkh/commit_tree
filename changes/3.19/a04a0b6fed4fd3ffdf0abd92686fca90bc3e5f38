ARM: dts: imx6qdl: Enable CODA960 VPU

This patch adds links to the on-chip SRAM and reset controller nodes
and switches the interrupts. Make the BIT processor interrupt, which exists on
all variants, the first one. The JPEG unit interrupt, which does not exist on
i.MX27 and i.MX5 thus is an optional second interrupt.
Use different compatible strings for i.MX6Q/D and i.MX6S/DL, as they have to
load separate firmware images for some reason.
