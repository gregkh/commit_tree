ALSA: oxfw: Add support for capture/playback MIDI messages

This commit adds MIDI functionality with an assumption of 'if the device
has MIDI comformant data channels in its stream formation, the device has
one MIDI port'.

When no streams have already started, MIDI functionality starts stream
with current sampling rate.

When MIDI functionality has already starts some streams and PCM
functionality is going to start streams at different sampling rate,
this driver stops streams once and changes sampling rate, then restarts
streams for both PCM/MIDI substreams.
