coresight-tmc: add CoreSight TMC driver

This driver manages CoreSight TMC (Trace Memory Controller) which
can act as a link or a sink depending upon its configuration. It
can present itself as an ETF (Embedded Trace FIFO) or ETR
(Embedded Trace Router).

ETF when configured in circular buffer mode acts as a trace
collection sink. When configured in HW fifo mode it acts as link.
ETR always acts as a sink and can be used to route data to memory
allocated in RAM.
