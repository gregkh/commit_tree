tun: add VNET_LE flag

virtio 1.0 modified virtio net header format,
making all fields little endian.

Users can tweak header format before submitting it to tun,
but this means more data copies where none were necessary.
And if the iovec is in RO memory, this means we might
need to split iovec also means we might in theory overflow
iovec max size.

This patch adds a simpler way for applications to handle this,
using new "little endian" flag in tun.
As a result, tun simply byte-swaps header fields as appropriate.
This is a NOP on LE architectures.
