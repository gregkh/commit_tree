iommu: Improve error handling when setting bus iommu

When some part of bus_set_iommu fails it should undo any made changes
and not simply leave everything as is.

This includes unregistering the bus notifier in iommu_bus_init when
add_iommu_group fails and also setting the bus->iommu_ops back to NULL.
