Revert "serial: of-serial: fetch line number from DT"

This reverts commit 1bd8324535ec1ff44aef55c0e40b9e7d56b310fb.

To quote Olof:
	This commit broke a whole lot of tegra boards in last night's
	-next here. In particular, I've been looking at
	tegra20-seaboard, which now doesn't boot with console any more.

Breaking existing systems is bad.
