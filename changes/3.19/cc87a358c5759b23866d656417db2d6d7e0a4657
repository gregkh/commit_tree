mmc: mxs-mmc: Register the irq with the device name

Instead of registering the irq name with the driver's name, it's better to pass
the device name so that we have a more explicit indication as to what mmc
instance the irq is related:

$ cat /proc/interrupts
           CPU0
...
 26:          6         -  96  80010000.ssp
