usb: musb: core: check link status on resume

The am335x-evmsk support two kinds of suspend:
- standby
  the USB device remains powered while the system goes into suspend

- mem
  the USB device becomes powerless while the system goes into suspend.

In the "standby" case the device resumes quickly. In the "mem" case the
system hangs for a few seconds. It seems to me that the USB-device has
no address (it was disconnected) and the USB stack thinks that it is
fully operational and GetPortStatus returns the status from before the
suspend so it is not a big help here.

This adds a check in the resume path to see if the device mode (A or B)
and the speed is the same. If the device went missing between
suspend/resume (VBUS went down) then MUSB seems to go into B mode and
HS/FS bits are cleared. In that case we clear the port1_status bits and
assume a disconnect. Once the stack learns this it does a "logical
disconnect" and removes the USB-device quickly. Should the device remain
connected during the suspend then MUSB will receives a "CONNECT" interrupt.
