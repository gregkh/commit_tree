ALSA: oxfw: Change the way to name card

This is a preparation for more models. In following commit, members
of 'struct snd_card' related to name becomes to consists of vendor and
model strings in device's config-rom.

Current supported devices also has strings in their config rom, but the
strings are too long to name sound card, thus this driver still keep
hard-coded vendor and model names for them.
