/dev/mem: Use more consistent data types

The xlate_dev_{kmem,mem}_ptr() functions take either a physical address
or a kernel virtual address, so data types should be phys_addr_t and
void *. They both return a kernel virtual address which is only ever
used in calls to copy_{from,to}_user(), so make variables that store it
void * rather than char * for consistency.

Also only define a weak unxlate_dev_mem_ptr() function if architectures
haven't overridden them in the asm/io.h header file.
