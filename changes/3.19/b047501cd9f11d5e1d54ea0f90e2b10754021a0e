memcg: use generic slab iterators for showing slabinfo

Let's use generic slab_start/next/stop for showing memcg caches info.  In
contrast to the current implementation, this will work even if all memcg
caches' info doesn't fit into a seq buffer (a page), plus it simply looks
neater.

Actually, the main reason I do this isn't mere cleanup.  I'm going to zap
the memcg_slab_caches list, because I find it useless provided we have the
slab_caches list, and this patch is a step in this direction.

It should be noted that before this patch an attempt to read
memory.kmem.slabinfo of a cgroup that doesn't have kmem limit set resulted
in -EIO, while after this patch it will silently show nothing except the
header, but I don't think it will frustrate anyone.
