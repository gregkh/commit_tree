tracing: Replace seq_printf by simpler equivalents

Using seq_printf to print a simple string or a single character is a
lot more expensive than it needs to be, since seq_puts and seq_putc
exist.

These patches do

  seq_printf(m, s) -> seq_puts(m, s)
  seq_printf(m, "%s", s) -> seq_puts(m, s)
  seq_printf(m, "%c", c) -> seq_putc(m, c)

Subsequent patches will simplify further.
