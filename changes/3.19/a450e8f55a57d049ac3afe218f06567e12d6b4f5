powerpc/eeh: Dump PHB diag-data early

On PowerNV platform, PHB diag-data is dumped after stopping device
drivers. In case of recursive EEH errors, the kernel is usually
crashed before dumping PHB diag-data for the second EEH error. It's
hard to locate the root cause of the second EEH error without PHB
diag-data.

The patch adds one more EEH option "eeh=early_log", which helps
dumping PHB diag-data immediately once frozen PE is detected, in
order to get the PHB diag-data for the second EEH error.
