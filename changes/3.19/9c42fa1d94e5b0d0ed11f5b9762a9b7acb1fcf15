ARM: dts: vf610-colibri: Add PWM support

The Colibri standard defines four pins as PWM outputs, two of them (PWM
A and C) are routed to FTM instance 0 and the other two (PWM B and D)
are routed to FTM instance 1. Hence enable both FTM instances for the
Colibri module and mux the four pins accordingly.
