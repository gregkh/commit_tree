x86/nmi: Perform a safe NMI stack trace on all CPUs

When trigger_all_cpu_backtrace() is called on x86, it will trigger an
NMI on each CPU and call show_regs(). But this can lead to a hard lock
up if the NMI comes in on another printk().

In order to avoid this, when the NMI triggers, it switches the printk
routine for that CPU to call a NMI safe printk function that records the
printk in a per_cpu seq_buf descriptor. After all NMIs have finished
recording its data, the seq_bufs are printed in a safe context.
