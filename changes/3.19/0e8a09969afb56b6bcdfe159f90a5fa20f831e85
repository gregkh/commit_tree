KVM: x86: Clear DR7.LE during task-switch

DR7.LE should be cleared during task-switch. This feature is poorly documented.
For reference, see:
http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2005/readings/i386/s12_02.htm

SDM [17.2.4]:
  This feature is not supported in the P6 family processors, later IA-32
  processors, and Intel 64 processors.

AMD [2:13.1.1.4]:
  This bit is ignored by implementations of the AMD64 architecture.

Intel's formulation could mean that it isn't even zeroed, but current
hardware indeed does not behave like that.
