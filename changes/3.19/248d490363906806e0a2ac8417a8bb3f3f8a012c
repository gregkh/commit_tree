eeepc-laptop: flatten control flow

In eeepc_rfkill_hotplug there's an if statement with a big tail that
ends right before the out_unlock label. We might as well invert the
condition and jump to out_unlock in that case, pretty much like the rest
of the code does. This removes an indentation level for a large chunk of
code and also stops suggesting there might be an else clause.
