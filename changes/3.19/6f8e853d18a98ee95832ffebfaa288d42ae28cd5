ARM: OMAP2+: clock: fix DPLL code to use new determine rate APIs

While the change for determine_rate clock operation was merged,
the OMAP counterpart using these calls was overlooked for some reason,
and caused boot failures on at least OMAP4 platforms. Fixed by updating
the DPLL API calls to use the new parameters.
