iwlwifi: mvm: protect session during CSA

When another vif is also running during a channel switch, we need to
use a session protection when we move to the new channel, so that we
don't miss the beacons.  Without this, sometimes the other vif
repeatedly gets time exactly when we should be hearing the beacons,
preventing channel switch from completing.  Adding a session
protection that lasts from the moment the channel changes until 2
TBTTs later, ensures that we will hear the beacons on the destination
channel.
