mac80211: update the channel context after channel switch

When the channel switch has been made, a vif is now using
the channel context which was reserved. When that happens,
we need to update the channel context since its parameters
may change.

I hit a case in which I switched to a 40Mhz channel but the
reserved channel context was still on 20Mhz. The rate control
would try to send 40Mhz packets on a 20Mhz channel context and
that made iwlwifi's firmware unhappy.
