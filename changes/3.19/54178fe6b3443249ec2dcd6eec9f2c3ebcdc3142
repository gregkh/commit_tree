tty: serial: 8250: omap: line is unsigned, don't check < 0

Dan Carpenter reported:
|drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_omap.c:1025 omap8250_probe()
|warn: unsigned 'up.port.line' is never less than zero.
|1025          if (up.port.line < 0) {

I (wrongly) assumed that line is an int and compiler didn't complain nor
did sparse. Since of_alias_get_id() and pdev->id can get negative I
check for the error via ret variable.
