tracing: Have seq_buf use full buffer

Currently seq_buf is full when all but one byte of the buffer is
filled. Change it so that the seq_buf is full when all of the
buffer is filled.

Some of the functions would fill the buffer completely and report
everything was fine. This was inconsistent with the max of size - 1.
Changing this to be max of size makes all functions consistent.
