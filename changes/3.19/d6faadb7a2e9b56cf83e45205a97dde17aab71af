drm/i915/dp: Don't stop the link when retraining

On pre-ddi platforms we don't shut down the link when changing link
training parameters. Except when clock recovery fails too hard and we
restart with channel eq training. Which doesn't make a lot of sense
really, since just stopping/restarting the DP port at this point
violates the modeset sequence documented in the Bspec.

So let's tempt fate and try this.

This patch is motivated by a WARN_ON triggered by
