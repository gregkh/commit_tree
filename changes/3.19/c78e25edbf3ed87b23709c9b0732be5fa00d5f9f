net/mlx4_core: Avoid double dumping of the PF device capabilities

To support asymmetric EQ allocations, we should query the device
capabilities prior to enabling SRIOV. As a side effect of adding that,
we are dumping the PF device capabilities twice. Avoid that by moving
the printing into a helper function which is called once.

		     EQs and MSI-X vectors for PF/VFs')
