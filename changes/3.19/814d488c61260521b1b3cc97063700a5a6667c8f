tcp: fix the timid additive increase on stretch ACKs

tcp_cong_avoid_ai() was too timid (snd_cwnd increased too slowly) on
"stretch ACKs" -- cases where the receiver ACKed more than 1 packet in
a single ACK. For example, suppose w is 10 and we get a stretch ACK
for 20 packets, so acked is 20. We ought to increase snd_cwnd by 2
(since acked/w = 20/10 = 2), but instead we were only increasing cwnd
by 1. This patch fixes that behavior.
