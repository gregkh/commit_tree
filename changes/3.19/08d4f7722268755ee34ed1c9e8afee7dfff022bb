dcache: fix kmemcheck warning in switch_names

This patch fixes kmemcheck warning in switch_names. The function
switch_names swaps inline names of two dentries. It swaps full arrays
d_iname, no matter how many bytes are really used by the strings. Reading
data beyond string ends results in kmemcheck warning.

We fix the bug by marking both arrays as fully initialized.
