ARM: dts: rockchip: add main thermal info to rk3288

If for some reason we are unable to shut it down in orderly fashion
(kernel is stuck holding a lock or similar), then hardware TSHUT will
reset it.

If the temperature is over 95C over a period of time the thermal shutdown
of the tsadc is invoked with can either reset the entire chip via the CRU,
or notify the PMIC via a GPIO. This should be set in the specific board.
