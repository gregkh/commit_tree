ath9k: Fix RoC expiration

mac80211 has to be notified when a RoC period
expires in the driver. In MCC mode, since the
offchannel/RoC timer is set with the requested
duration, ieee80211_remain_on_channel_expired() needs
to be called when the timer expires.

But, currently it is done after we move back to
the operating channel. This is incorrect - fix this
by calling ieee80211_remain_on_channel_expired() when
the RoC timer expires and in ath_roc_complete() when
the RoC request is aborted.
