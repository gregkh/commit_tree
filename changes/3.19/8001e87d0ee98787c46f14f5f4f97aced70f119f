dm array: if resizing the array is a noop set the new root to the old one

This could've been quite bad (to return success but not update the new
root to point at the old) but in practice the only known consumer of the
dm array code is the DM cache target.  And the DM cache target passes in
the same old root to array_resize() anyway.
