can: dev: Consolidate and unify state change handling

The handling of can error states is different between platforms.
This is an attempt to correct that problem.

I've moved this handling into a generic function for changing the
error state. This ensures that error state changes are handled
the same way everywhere (where this function is used).

This new mechanism also adds reverse state transitioning in error
frames, i.e. the user will be notified through the socket interface
when the state goes down.
