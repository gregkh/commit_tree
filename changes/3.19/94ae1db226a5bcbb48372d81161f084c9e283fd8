nfsd: fix fi_delegees leak when fi_had_conflict returns true

Currently, nfs4_set_delegation takes a reference to an existing
delegation and then checks to see if there is a conflict. If there is
one, then it doesn't release that reference.

Change the code to take the reference after the check and only if there
is no conflict.
