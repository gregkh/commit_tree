cpufreq: Fix formatting issues in 'struct cpufreq_driver'

Adding any new callback to 'struct cpufreq_driver' gives following checkpatch
warning:

WARNING: Unnecessary space before function pointer arguments
+	void	(*ready)	(struct cpufreq_policy *policy);

This is because we have been using a tab spacing between function pointer name
and its arguments and the new one tried to follow that.

Though we normally don't try to fix every checkpatch warning, specially around
formatting issues as that creates unnecessary noise over lists. But I thought we
better fix this so that new additions don't generate these warnings plus it
looks far better/symmetric now.

So, remove these tab spacing issues in 'struct cpufreq_driver' only + fix
alignment of all members.
