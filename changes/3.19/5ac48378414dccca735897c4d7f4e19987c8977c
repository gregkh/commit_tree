tracing: Use trace_seq_used() and seq_buf_used() instead of len

As the seq_buf->len will soon be +1 size when there's an overflow, we
must use trace_seq_used() or seq_buf_used() methods to get the real
length. This will prevent buffer overflow issues if just the len
of the seq_buf descriptor is used to copy memory.
