nfs: fix dio deadlock when O_DIRECT flag is flipped

We only support swap file calling nfs_direct_IO. However, application
might be able to get to nfs_direct_IO if it toggles O_DIRECT flag
during IO and it can deadlock because we grab inode->i_mutex in
nfs_file_direct_write(). So return 0 for such case. Then the generic
layer will fall back to buffer IO.
