Staging: lustre: Replace non-standard spinlock macro definations

This patch replaces non-standard spin lock macro with standard linux function.

This is done using Coccinelle and semantic patch used is as follows:

@@
expression x;
@@

- TREE_READ_LOCK_IRQ(x)
+ spin_lock_irq(&(x)->tree_lock)

@@
expression x;
@@

- TREE_READ_UNLOCK_IRQ(x)
+ spin_unlock_irq(&(x)->tree_lock)

Also semantic patch result is modified by droping ->,
inner & and adding . for simplification of code.
