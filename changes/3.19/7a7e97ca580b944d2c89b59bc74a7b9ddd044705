dm thin: performance improvement to discard processing

When processing a discard bio, if the block is already quiesced do the
discard immediately rather than adding the mapping to a list for the
next iteration of the worker thread.

Discarding a fully provisioned 100G thin volume with 64k block size goes
from 860s to 95s with this change.

Clearly there's something wrong with the worker architecture, more
investigation needed.
