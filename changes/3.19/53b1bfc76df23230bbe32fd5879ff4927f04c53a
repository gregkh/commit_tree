pinctrl: rockchip: Avoid losing interrupts when supporting both edges

I was seeing cases where I was losing interrupts when inserting and
removing SD cards.  Sometimes the card would get "stuck" in the
inserted state.

I believe that the problem was related to the code to handle the case
where we needed both rising and falling edges.  This code would
disable the interrupt as the polarity was switched.  If an interrupt
came at the wrong time it could be lost.

We'll match what the gpio-dwapb.c driver does upstream and change the
interrupt polarity without disabling things.
