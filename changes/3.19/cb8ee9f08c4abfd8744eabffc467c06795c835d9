serial: Fix io address assign flow with Fintek PCI-to-UART Product

The original driver fixed the io address with 0xe000+idx*8,
but real io address assigned from BIOS is dynamically from
read PCI configure space 0x24, 0x20, 0x1c.

The Fintek F81504/F81508/F81512 maybe malfunction without
this patch and malfunction surely when more then 1 PCI card.
