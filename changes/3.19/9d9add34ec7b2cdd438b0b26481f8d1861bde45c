tracing: Have function_graph use trace_seq_has_overflowed()

Instead of doing individual checks all over the place that makes the code
very messy. Just check trace_seq_has_overflowed() at the end or in
strategic places.

This makes the code much cleaner and also helps with getting closer
to removing the return values of trace_seq_printf() and friends.
