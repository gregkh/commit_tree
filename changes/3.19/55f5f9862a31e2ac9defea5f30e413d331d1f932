i2c: sh_mobile: rework deferred probing

DMA is opt-in for this driver. So, we can't use deferred probing for
requesting DMA channels in probe, because our driver would get endlessly
deferred if DMA support is compiled in AND the DMA driver is missing.
Because we can't know when the DMA driver might show up, we always try
again when a DMA transfer would be possible. The downside is that there
is more overhead for setting up PIO transfers under the above scenario.
But well, having DMA enabled and the proper DMA driver missing looks
like a broken or test config anyhow.
