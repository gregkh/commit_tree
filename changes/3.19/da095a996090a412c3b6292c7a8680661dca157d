xen/arm: introduce GNTTABOP_cache_flush

Introduce support for new hypercall GNTTABOP_cache_flush.
Use it to perform cache flashing on pages used for dma when necessary.

If GNTTABOP_cache_flush is supported by the hypervisor, we don't need to
bounce dma map operations that involve foreign grants and non-coherent
devices.
