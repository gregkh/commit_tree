xen: correct race in alloc_p2m_pmd()

When allocating a new pmd for the linear mapped p2m list a check is
done for not introducing another pmd when this just happened on
another cpu. In this case the old pte pointer was returned which
points to the p2m_missing or p2m_identity page. The correct value
would be the pointer to the found new page.
