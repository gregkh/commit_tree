tracing: Fix trace_seq_bitmask() to start at current position

In trace_seq_bitmask() it calls bitmap_scnprintf() not from the current
position of the trace_seq buffer (s->buffer + s->len), but instead from
the beginning of the buffer (s->buffer).

Luckily, the only user of this "ipi_raise tracepoint" uses it as the
first parameter, and as such, the start of the temp buffer in
include/trace/ftrace.h (see __get_bitmask()).
