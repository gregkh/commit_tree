drm/i915: Extend pcode mailbox interface

In sandybridge_pcode_read and sandybridge_pcode_write,
extend the mbox parameter from u8 to u32.

On Haswell and Sandybridge, bits 7:0 encode the mailbox
command and bits 28:8 are used for address control for
specific commands.

Based on suggestion from Ville Syrj채l채.
