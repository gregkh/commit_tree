HID: Add a new id 0x501a for Genius MousePen i608X

New Genius MousePen i608X devices have a new id 0x501a instead of the
old 0x5011 so add a new #define with "_2" appended and change required
places.

The remaining two checkpatch warnings about line length
being over 80 characters are present in the original files too and this
patch was made in the same style (no line break).

Just adding a new id and changing the required places should make the
new device work without any issues according to the bug report in the
following url.

This patch was made according to and fixes:
