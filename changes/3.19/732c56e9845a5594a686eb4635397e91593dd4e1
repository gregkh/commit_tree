virtio_ccw: add support for 64 bit features.

Negotiate full 64 bit features.
Change u32 to u64, make sure to use 1ULL everywhere.

Note: devices guarantee that VERSION_1 is clear unless
revision 1 is negotiated.

Note: We don't need to re-setup the ccw, but we do it
for clarity.

Based on patches by Rusty, Thomas Huth and Cornelia.
