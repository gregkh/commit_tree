mm: memcontrol: uncharge pages on swapout

This series gets rid of the remaining page_cgroup flags, thus cutting the
memcg per-page overhead down to one pointer.

This patch (of 4):

mem_cgroup_swapout() is called with exclusive access to the page at the
end of the page's lifetime.  Instead of clearing the PCG_MEMSW flag and
deferring the uncharge, just do it right away.  This allows follow-up
patches to simplify the uncharge code.
