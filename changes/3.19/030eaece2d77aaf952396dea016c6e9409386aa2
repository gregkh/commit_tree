ixgbe: Add x550 SW/FW semaphore support

The X550 hardware will use more bits in the mask, so change
the prototypes to match.  This larger mask will require changes
in callers which use the higher bits. Likewise since X550 will
use different semaphore mask values and will use the lan_id
value.  So save these values in the ixgbe_phy_info struct.
