scsi: remove ->change_queue_type method

Since we got rid of ordered tag support in 2010 the prime use case of
switching on and off ordered tags has been obsolete.  The other function
of enabling/disabling tagging entirely has only been correctly implemented
by the 53c700 driver and isn't generally useful.
