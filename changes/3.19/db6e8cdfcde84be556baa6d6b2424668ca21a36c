mmc: sdhci-pci: Add SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_ENDATTR_IN_NOPDESC to BYT

SDHCI_QUIRK_NO_ENDATTR_IN_NOPDESC actually causes
standard-compliant behaviour by causing the flagging
of the last DMA transfer descriptor as the end
instead of there being an additional nop descriptor
which is flagged as the end.  Consequently, it is
better to have the quirk.  Add it for BYT.
