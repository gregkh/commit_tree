MIPS: Loongson: Allow booting from any core

By offering Logical->Physical core id mapping, so as to reserve some
physical cores via mask. This allow booting from any core when core-0
has problems. Since the maximun cores supported by Loongson-3 is 16,
32-bit cpu_startup_core_id can be split to 16-bit cpu_startup_core_id
and 16-bit reserved_cores_mask for compatibility.
