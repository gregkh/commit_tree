bridge: Add support for IEEE 802.11 Proxy ARP

This feature is defined in IEEE Std 802.11-2012, 10.23.13. It allows
the AP devices to keep track of the hardware-address-to-IP-address
mapping of the mobile devices within the WLAN network.

The AP will learn this mapping via observing DHCP, ARP, and NS/NA
frames. When a request for such information is made (i.e. ARP request,
Neighbor Solicitation), the AP will respond on behalf of the
associated mobile device. In the process of doing so, the AP will drop
the multicast request frame that was intended to go out to the wireless
medium.

It was recommended at the LKS workshop to do this implementation in
the bridge layer. vxlan.c is already doing something very similar.
The DHCP snooping code will be added to the userspace application
(hostapd) per the recommendation.

This RFC commit is only for IPv4. A similar approach in the bridge
layer will be taken for IPv6 as well.
