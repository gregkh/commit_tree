mmc: core: hold SD Clock before CMD11 during Signal

Voltage Switch Procedure

This patch is to fix an issue found on mb86s7x platforms.

[symptom]
There are some UHS-1 SD memory cards sometimes cannot be detected correctly,
e.g., Transcend 600x SDXC 64GB UHS-1 memory card.
During Signal Voltage Switch Procedure, failure to switch is indicated
by the card holding DAT[3:0] low.

[analysis]
According to SD Host Controller Simplified Specification Version 3.00
chapter 3.6.1, the Signal Voltage Switch Procedure should be:
(1) Check S18A; (2) Issue CMD11; (3) Check CMD 11 response;
(4) Stop providing SD clock; (5) Check DAT[3:0] should be 0000b;
(6) Set 1.8V Signal Enable; (7) Wait 5ms; (8) Check 1.8V Signal Enable;
(9) Provide SD Clock; (10) Wait 1ms; (11) Check DAT[3:0] should be 1111b;
(12) error handling

With CONFIG_MMC_CLKGATE=y, sometimes there is one more gating/un-gating
SD clock between (2) and (3). In this case, some UHS-1 SD cards will hold
DAT[3:0] 0000b at (11) and thus fails Signal Voltage Switch Procedure.

[solution]
By mmc_host_clk_hold() before CMD11, the additional gating/un-gating
SD clock between (2) and (3) can be prevented and thus no failure at (11).
It has been verified with many UHS-1 SD cards on mb86s7x platforms and
works correctly.
