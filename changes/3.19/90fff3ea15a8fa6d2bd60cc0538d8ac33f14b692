xen: introduce helper functions to do safe read and write accesses

Introduce two helper functions to safely read and write unsigned long
values from or to memory when the access may fault because the mapping
is non-present or read-only.

These helpers can be used instead of open coded uses of __get_user()
and __put_user() avoiding the need to do casts to fix sparse warnings.

Use the helpers in page.h and p2m.c. This will fix the sparse
warnings when doing "make C=1".
