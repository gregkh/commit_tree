HID: saitek: quirk for Saitek R.A.T.7 works with R.A.T.9 too

I have tested HID quirk for Saitek R.A.T.7 with my R.A.T. 9. It works fine for
me. Attached patch makes the necessary changes to use the quirk on the R.A.T.9
too, and necessary Kconfig changes too.

I have stylized the Kconfig option name to include Mad Catz in the option name,
as (at least some of) the devices are marketed under Mad Catz brand.
