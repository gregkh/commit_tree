kvm: x86: Fix kvm clock versioning.

kvm updates the version number for the guest paravirt clock structure by
incrementing the version of its private copy. It does not read the guest
version, so will write version = 2 in the first update for every new VM,
including after restoring a saved state. If guest state is saved during
reading the clock, it could read and accept struct fields and guest TSC
from two different updates. This changes the code to increment the guest
version and write it back.
