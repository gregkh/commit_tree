ARM: mm: allow text and rodata sections to be read-only

This introduces CONFIG_DEBUG_RODATA, making kernel text and rodata
read-only. Additionally, this splits rodata from text so that rodata can
also be NX, which may lead to wasted memory when aligning to SECTION_SIZE.
The read-only areas are made writable during ftrace updates and kexec.
