drm/atomic_helper: Cope with plane->crtc == NULL in disable helper

The drm core can call the plane disable hook multiple times, which
means it can get called when plane->crtc is already NULL. That in turn
means we can't get at the implicit acquire ctx we use in the atomic
helpers for legacy entries points.

We could try to pass drm_modeset_legacy_acquire_ctx a drm_device
pointer so that it can cope with a NULL crtc. But that still doesn't
work since the cursor ioctls (remapped with the universal cursor plane
support code) only grabs the crtc locks. So the global acquire context
isn't set eitehr.

The real solution here would be to bite the bullet and wire up
explicit acquire context parameters to all relevant functions. We need
to do that anyway (to be able to get rid of some small allocations
which we can't cope with failing). But that's a lot of work and better
done once atomic has settled a bit.

So meanwhile just catch this case in the helper and bail out.
