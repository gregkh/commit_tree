NFSv4.1: Fix client id trunking on Linux

Currently, our trunking code will check for session trunking, but will
fail to detect client id trunking. This is a problem, because it means
that the client will fail to recognise that the two connections represent
shared state, even if they do not permit a shared session.
By removing the check for the server minor id, and only checking the
major id, we will end up doing the right thing in both cases: we close
down the new nfs_client and fall back to using the existing one.
