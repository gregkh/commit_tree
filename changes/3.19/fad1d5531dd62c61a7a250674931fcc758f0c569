ARM: dts: sun6i: Add EHCI support for the M9 board

The Mele M9 / A1000G quad uses both usb-ports, one goes to an internal
usb wifi card, the other to a build-in usb-hub, so neither need their
OHCI companion controller to be enabled since the are always connected at
USB-2 speeds.

The controller which is attached to the wifi also does not need a vbus
regulator.
