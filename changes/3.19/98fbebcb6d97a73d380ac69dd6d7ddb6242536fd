stmmac: remove BUS_MODE_DA

This is a very old and often unused option to configure
a bit in a register inside the DMA. This support should
not stay under Koption and should be extended for new chips too.
This will be do later maybe via device-tree parameters.
Also no performance impact when remove this setting on STi platforms.
