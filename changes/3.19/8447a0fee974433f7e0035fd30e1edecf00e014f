cpuset: convert callback_mutex to a spinlock

The callback_mutex is only used to synchronize reads/updates of cpusets'
flags and cpu/node masks. These operations should always proceed fast so
there's no reason why we can't use a spinlock instead of the mutex.

Converting the callback_mutex into a spinlock will let us call
cpuset_zone_allowed_softwall from atomic context. This, in turn, makes
it possible to simplify the code by merging the hardwall and asoftwall
checks into the same function, which is the business of the next patch.
