cpuidle / ACPI: remove unused CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIME_INVALID

CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIME_INVALID is no longer checked
by menu or ladder cpuidle governors, so don't
bother setting or defining it.

It was originally invented to account for the fact that
acpi_safe_halt() enables interrupts to invoke HLT.
That would allow interrupt service routines to be included
in the last_idle duration measurements made in cpuidle_enter_state(),
potentially returning a duration much larger than reality.

But menu and ladder can gracefully handle erroneously large duration
intervals without checking for CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIME_INVALID.
Further, if they don't check CPUIDLE_FLAG_TIME_INVALID, they
can also benefit from the instances when the duration interval
is not erroneously large.
