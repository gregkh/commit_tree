kbuild: Automatically remove stale <linux/version.h> file

In 3.7, the file moved from include/linux/ to
include/generated/uapi/linux/. The path in the #include directive
remained the same for compatibility reasons, but this created a problem
when bisecting. Commit 9c8cdb71 (kbuild: unconditionally clobber
include/linux/version.h on distclean) fixes this, provided the user does
make distclean between builds. Better not rely on the user and delete
the stale file each time make is invoked.
