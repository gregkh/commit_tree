kvm: x86: vmx: reorder some msr writing

The commit 34a1cd60d17f, "x86: vmx: move some vmx setting from
vmx_init() to hardware_setup()", tried to refactor some codes
specific to vmx hardware setting into hardware_setup(), but some
msr writing should depend on our previous setting condition like
enable_apicv, enable_ept and so on.
