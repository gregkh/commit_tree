i2c/of: Factor out Devicetree registration code

Dynamically inserting i2c client device nodes requires the use
of a single device registration method. Factor out the loop body of
of_i2c_register_devices() so that it can be called for individual
device_nodes instead of for all the children of a node.

Note: The diff of this commit looks far more complicated than it
actually is due the indentation being changed for a large block of code.
When viewed using the diff -w flag to ignore whitespace changes it can
be seen that the change is actually quite simple.
