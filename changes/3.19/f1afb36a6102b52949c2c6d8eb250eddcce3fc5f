dm cache policy mq: simplify ability to promote sequential IO to the cache

Before, if the user wanted sequential IO to be promoted to the cache
they'd have to set sequential_threshold to some nebulous large value.

Now, the user may easily disable sequential IO detection (and sequential
IO's implicit bypass of the cache) by setting sequential_threshold to 0.
