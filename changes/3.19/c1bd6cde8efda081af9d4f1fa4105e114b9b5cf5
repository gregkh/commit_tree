IB/core: Do not resolve VLAN if already resolved

For RoCE, resolution of layer 2 address attributes forces no VLAN if
link-local GIDs are used.  This patch allows applications to choose
the VLAN ID for link-local based RoCE GIDs by setting IB_QP_VID in
their QP attribute mask, and prevents the core from overriding this
choice.
