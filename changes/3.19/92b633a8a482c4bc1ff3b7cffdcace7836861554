mtd: physmap_of: fix potential NULL dereference

On device remove, when testing the cmtd field of an of_flash
struct to decide whether it is a concatenated device or not,
we get a false positive on cmtd == NULL, and dereference it
subsequently. This may occur if of_flash_remove() is called
from the cleanup path of of_flash_probe().

Instead, test for NULL first, and only then perform the test
for a concatenated device.
