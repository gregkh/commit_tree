MIPS: Loongson-3: Add PHYS48_TO_HT40 support

The width of HT-bus is only 40-bit, but Loongson-3 has 48-bit physical
address. This implies only node-0's memory is DMAable because high bits
(Node ID) will lost. Fortunately, by configuring address windows in
firmware, we can extract 2bit Node ID (bit 44~47, only bit 44~45 used
now) from Loongson-3's 48-bit address space and embed it into 40-bit
(bit 37~38). Every NUMA node can do DMA now (however, maximum memory of
each node is reduced to 2^37 = 128GB).
