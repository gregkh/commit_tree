be2net: Fix incorrect setting of tunnel offload flag in netdev features

An earlier commit to resolve an issue with encapsulation offloads missed
setting a bit in the outer netdev features flag. This results in loss of TSO
feature on a VxLAN interface.

Fixes: 630f4b70 ("Export tunnel offloads only when a VxLAN tunnel is created")
