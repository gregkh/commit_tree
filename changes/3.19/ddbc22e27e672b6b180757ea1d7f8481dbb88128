fs/hfs/catalog.c: fix comparison bug in hfs_cat_keycmp

Relying on the sign (after casting to int) of the difference of two
quantities for comparison is usually wrong.  For example, should a-b
turn out to be 2^31, the return value of cmp(a,b) is -2^31; but that
would also be the return value from cmp(b, a).  So a compares less than
b and b compares less than a.  One can also easily find three values
a,b,c such that a compares less than b, b compares less than c, but a
does not compare less than c.
