cfg80211: 802.11p OCB mode handling

This patch adds new iface type (NL80211_IFTYPE_OCB) representing
the OCB (Outside the Context of a BSS) mode.
When establishing a connection to the network a cfg80211_join_ocb
function is called (particular nl80211_command is added as well).
A mandatory parameters during the ocb_join operation are 'center
frequency' and 'channel width (5/10 MHz)'.

Changes done in mac80211 are minimal possible required to avoid
many warnings (warning: enumeration value 'NL80211_IFTYPE_OCB'
not handled in switch) during compilation. Full functionality
(where needed) is added in the following patch.
