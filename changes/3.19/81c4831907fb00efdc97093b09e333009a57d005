ARM: dts: vf610: Add ARM Global Timer

Add Global Timer support which is part of the private peripherals
of the Cortex-A5 processor. This Global Timer is compatible with the
Cortex-A9 implementation. It's a 64-bit timer and is clocked by the
peripheral clock, which is typically 133 or 166MHz on Vybrid.
