can: peak_usb: fix memset() usage

This patchs fixes a misplaced call to memset() that fills the request
buffer with 0. The problem was with sending PCAN_USBPRO_REQ_FCT
requests, the content set by the caller was thus lost.

With this patch, the memory area is zeroed only when requesting info
from the device.
