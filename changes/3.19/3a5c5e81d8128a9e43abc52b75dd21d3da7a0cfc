mac80211: properly set CCK flag in radiotap

Fix a regression introduced by commit a5e70697d0c4 ("mac80211: add radiotap flag
and handling for 5/10 MHz") where the IEEE80211_CHAN_CCK channel type flag was
incorrectly replaced by the IEEE80211_CHAN_OFDM flag. This commit fixes that by
using the CCK flag again.
