serial: core: Fix port count when uart_open() errors

A port count mismatch occurs if mutex_lock_interruptible()
exits uart_open() and the port has already been opened. This may
prematurely close a port on an open tty. Since uart_close() is _always_
called if uart_open() fails, the port count must be corrected if errors
occur.

Always increment the port count in uart_open(), regardless of errors;
always decrement the port count in uart_close(). Note that
tty_port_close_start() decrements the port count when uart_open()
was successful.
