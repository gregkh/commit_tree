kvm: x86: avoid warning about potential shift wrapping bug

cs.base is declared as a __u64 variable and vector is a u32 so this
causes a static checker warning.  The user indeed can set "sipi_vector"
to any u32 value in kvm_vcpu_ioctl_x86_set_vcpu_events(), but the
value should really have 8-bit precision only.
