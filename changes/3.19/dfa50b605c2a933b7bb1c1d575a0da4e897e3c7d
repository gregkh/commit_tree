sched: Make finish_task_switch() return 'struct rq *'

Both callers of finish_task_switch() need to recalculate this_rq()
and pass it as an argument, plus __schedule() does this again after
context_switch().

It would be simpler to call this_rq() once in finish_task_switch()
and return the this rq to the callers.

Note: probably "int cpu" in __schedule() should die; it is not used
and both rcu_note_context_switch() and wq_worker_sleeping() do not
really need this argument.
