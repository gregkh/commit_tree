checkpatch: fix use via symlink, make missing spelling file non-fatal

Commit 66b47b4a9dad ("checkpatch: look for common misspellings") made it
difficult to use checkpatch via a symlink.

Fix that and make a missing spelling.txt file non-fatal.  Emit a warning
when the spelling.txt file can not be opened.
