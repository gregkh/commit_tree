iommu/vt-d: Fix an off-by-one bug in __domain_mapping()

There's an off-by-one bug in function __domain_mapping(), which may
trigger the BUG_ON(nr_pages < lvl_pages) when
	(nr_pages + 1) & superpage_mask == 0

The issue was introduced by commit 9051aa0268dc "intel-iommu: Combine
domain_pfn_mapping() and domain_sg_mapping()", which sets sg_res to
"nr_pages + 1" to avoid some of the 'sg_res==0' code paths.

It's safe to remove extra "+1" because sg_res is only used to calculate
page size now.
