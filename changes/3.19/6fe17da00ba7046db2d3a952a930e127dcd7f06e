ASoC: rt5677: Fix the issue that the regmap_range "rt5677_ranges" cannot be accessed

After the patch "ASoC: rt5677: Use specific r/w function for DSP mode", the
regmap_range "rt5677_ranges" was not registered in rt5677_regmap_physical, and
it caused that the regmap_range "rt5677_ranges" cannot be accessed by the
specific r/w function. The patch fixes this issue.
