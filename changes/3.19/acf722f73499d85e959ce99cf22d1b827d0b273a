ip6_tunnel: allow to change mode for the ip6tnl0

The fallback device is in ipv6 mode by default.
The mode can not be changed in runtime, so there
is no way to decapsulate ip4in6 packets coming from
various sources without creating the specific tunnel
ifaces for each peer.

This allows to update the fallback tunnel device, but only
the mode could be changed. Usual command should work for the
fallback device: `ip -6 tun change ip6tnl0 mode any`

The fallback device can not be hidden from the packet receiver
as a regular tunnel, but there is no need for synchronization
as long as we do single assignment.
