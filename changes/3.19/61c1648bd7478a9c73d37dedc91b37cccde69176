ath10k: make warm reset a bit safer and faster

One of the problems with warm reset I've found is
that it must be guaranteed that copy engine
registers are not being accessed while being
reset. Otherwise in worst case scenario the host
may lock up.

Instead of using sleeps and hoping the device is
operational in some arbitrary timeframes use
firmware indication register.

As a side effect this makes driver
boot/stop/recovery faster.
