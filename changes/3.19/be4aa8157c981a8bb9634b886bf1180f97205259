staging: media: lirc: lirc_zilog.c: replace custom print macros with dev_* and pr_*

This patch removes the custom printk macros dprintk, zilog_notify,
zilog_error, and zilog_info. All the calls to these macros were
replaced by dev_dbg, dev_notice, dev_err, and dev_info respectively
whenever possible. There were cases in which pr_debug, pr_notice,
pr_err and pr_info were used. It was when the calling function did
not provide an appropiate dev variable.

Applying this patch will trigger the out of memory checkpatch warning
for two lines. It will be fixed in a separate patch.
