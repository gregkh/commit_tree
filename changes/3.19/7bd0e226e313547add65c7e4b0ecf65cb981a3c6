    drm: i915: Use nsec based interfaces

    Use ktime_get_raw_ns() and get rid of the back and forth timespec
    conversions.

So fix this up by reinstating our handrolled _timeout function. While
at it bother with handling MAX_JIFFIES.

v2: Convert to usecs (we don't care about the accuracy anyway) first
to avoid overflow issues Dave Gordon spotted.

v3: Drop the explicit MAX_JIFFY_OFFSET check, usecs_to_jiffies should
take care of that already. It might be a bit too enthusiastic about it
though.

v4: Chris has a much nicer color, so use his implementation.

This requires to export nsec_to_jiffies from time.c.
