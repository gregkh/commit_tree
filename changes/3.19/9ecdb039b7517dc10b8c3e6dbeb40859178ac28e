bochs: add endian switching support

Recently (qemu 2.2+) the qemu stdvga got a register to switch the vga
framebuffer endianness.  This patch adds code to explicitly set the
endianness of the framebuffer.  In most cases this has no effect as
the default is guest architecture endianness.  It is needed though in
case a architecture supports both big and little endian, i.e. for
ppc64le.
