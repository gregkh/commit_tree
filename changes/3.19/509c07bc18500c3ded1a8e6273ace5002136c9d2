IB/srp: Separate target and channel variables

Changes in this patch:
- Move channel variables into a new structure (struct srp_rdma_ch).
- Add an srp_target_port pointer, 'lock' and 'comp_vector' members
  in struct srp_rdma_ch.
- Add code to initialize these three new member variables.
- Many boring "target->" into "ch->" changes.
- The cm_id and completion handler context pointers are now of type
  srp_rdma_ch * instead of srp_target_port *.
- Three kzalloc(a * b, f) calls have been changed into kcalloc(a, b, f)
  to avoid that this patch would trigger a checkpatch warning.
- Two casts from u64 into unsigned long long have been left out
  because these are superfluous. Since considerable time u64 is
  defined as unsigned long long for all architectures supported by
  the Linux kernel.
