Bluetooth: Fix RFCOMM NSC response

rfcomm_send_nsc expects CR to be either 0 or 1 since it is later
passed to __mcc_type macro and shitfed. Unfortunatelly CR extracted
from received frame type was not sanitized and shifted value was passed
resulting in bogus response.

Note: shifted value was also passed to other functions but was used
only in if satements so this bug appears only for NSC case.

The CR bit in the value octet shall be set to the same value
as the CR bit in the type field octet of the not supported command
frame but the CR bit for NCS response should be set to 0 since it is
always a response.

This was affecting TC_RFC_BV_25_C PTS qualification test.
