sh_eth: Detach net device when stopping queue to resize DMA rings

We must only ever stop TX queues when they are full or the net device
is not 'ready' so far as the net core, and specifically the watchdog,
is concerned.  Otherwise, the watchdog may fire *immediately* if no
packets have been added to the queue in the last 5 seconds.

What's more, sh_eth_tx_timeout() will likely crash if called while
we're resizing the TX ring.

I could easily trigger this by running the loop:

   while ethtool -G eth0 rx 128 && ethtool -G eth0 rx 64; do echo -n .; done
