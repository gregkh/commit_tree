rcu: Optimize cond_resched_rcu_qs()

The current implementation of cond_resched_rcu_qs() can invoke
rcu_note_voluntary_context_switch() twice in the should_resched()
case, once via the call to __schedule() and once directly.  However, as
noted by Joe Lawrence in a patch to the team subsystem, cond_resched()
returns an indication as to whether or not the call to __schedule()
actually happened.  This commit therefore changes cond_resched_rcu_qs()
so as to invoke rcu_note_voluntary_context_switch() only when __schedule()
was not called.
