staging: comedi: amplc_pci230: use comedi_buf_write_samples()

Use comedi_buf_write_samples() to add the sample to the async buffer.

The async events will set properly by the core. A dev_warn() message will
also be output by the core if the buffer overflows. Remove the unnecessary
events and dev_err() message in the driver.

The core will also add the COMEDI_CB_BLOCK event when data is written to
the async buffer. Remove the unnecessary event in the driver.
