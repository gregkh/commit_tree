mac802154: add hardware address filter flag

Overdue introduction for address filtering hardware flag. Furthermore we
will check and set address filtering on interface up. This patch
prepares that we can check if an transceiver supports address filtering
option. Currently all mainline driver supports hardware address filtering.
