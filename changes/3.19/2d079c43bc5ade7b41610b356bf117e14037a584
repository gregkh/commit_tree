mmc: core: consistent handling of initial values

mmc_do_hw_reset(), mmc_power_up() and mmc_power_off() all set similar
initial values for bus_mode, bus_width, chip_select and timing. Let's
make this handling simpler and more consistent by sticking them
together in a common function. This will introduce small changes in
behavior in the following places:

mmc_power_off():

  For SPI hosts, explicitly set bus_mode = MMC_BUSMODE_PUSHPULL and
  chip_select = MMC_CS_HIGH, before we left them as they were.

  For non-SPI hosts, set bus_mode = MMC_BUSMODE_PUSHPULL instead of
  MMC_BUSMODE_OPENDRAIN as before.

  These two changes should not be a problem since the device will be
  powered off anyway.

mmc_do_hw_reset():

  Always set bus_mode = MMC_BUSMODE_PUSHPULL, as required by SD/SDIO
  cards. MMC cards require MMC_BUSMODE_OPENDRAIN, but this is taken
  care of by mmc_init_card() and mmc_attach_mmc().
