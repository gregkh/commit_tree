virtio_net: get rid of virtio_net_hdr/skb_vnet_hdr

virtio 1.0 doesn't use virtio_net_hdr anymore, and in fact, it's not
really useful since virtio_net_hdr_mrg_rxbuf includes that as the first
field anyway.

Let's drop it, precalculate header len and store within vi instead.

This way we can also remove struct skb_vnet_hdr.
