[media] cxusb: TS mode setting for TT CT2-4400

There is a new version of the TechnoTrend CT2-4400 USB tuner. The difference is the demodulator that is used (Si2168-B40 instead of -A30).

For TT CT2-4400v2 a TS stream related parameter needs to be set, otherwise the stream becomes corrupted. The Windows driver for both CT2-4400 and CT2-4400v2 sets this as well. After this patch the driver works for both versions.
