ARM: 8294/1: ATAG_DTB_COMPAT: remove the DT workspace's hardcoded 64KB size

There is currently a hardcoded limit of 64KB for the DTB to live in and
be extended with ATAG info.  Some DTBs have outgrown that limit:

$ du -b arch/arm/boot/dts/omap3-n900.dtb
70212   arch/arm/boot/dts/omap3-n900.dtb

Furthermore, the actual size passed to atags_to_fdt() included the stack
size which is obviously wrong.

The initial DTB size is known, so use it to size the allocated workspace
with a 50% growth assumption and relocate the temporary stack above that.
This is also clamped to 32KB min / 1MB max for robustness against bad
DTB data.
