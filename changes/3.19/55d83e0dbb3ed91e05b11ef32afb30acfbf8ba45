cifs: convert to print_hex_dump() instead of custom implementation

This patch converts custom dumper to use native print_hex_dump() instead. The
cifs_dump_mem() will have an offsets per each line which differs it from the
original code.

In the dump_smb() we may use native print_hex_dump() as well. It will show
slightly different output in ASCII part when character is unprintable,
otherwise it keeps same structure.
