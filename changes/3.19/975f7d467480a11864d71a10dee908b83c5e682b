qla2xxx: fix busy wait regression

Commit e05fe29248 (qla2xxx: Honor FCP_RSP retry delay timer field.)
causes systems to busy-wait for about 3 minutes after boot prior to
detecting SAN disks.

During this wait period one kworker is running full-time
(though /proc/<pid>/stack has no useful data). Another kworker is
waiting for IO to complete during that whole time period.

Looking at drivers/scsi/qla2xxx/qla_os.c, fcport->retry_delay_timestamp
has a special value of 0 though that 0 value forces system to wait when
jiffies is very large value (e.g. 4294952605 - "negative" value when
signed on 32bit systems).
