ARM: 8201/1: amba: Don't unprepare the clocks if device driver wants IRQ safe runtime PM v12

The AMBA bus driver defines runtime Power Management functions which
disable and unprepare AMBA bus clock. This is problematic for runtime PM
because unpreparing a clock might sleep so it is not interrupt safe.

However some drivers may want to implement runtime PM functions in
interrupt-safe way (see pm_runtime_irq_safe()). In such case the AMBA
bus driver should only disable/enable the clock in runtime suspend and
resume callbacks.
