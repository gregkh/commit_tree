Fix the way the local advertising flow options are determined

Local flow control options needed in order to resolve the negotiation
are incorrectly calculated.

Previously 'mii_advertise_flowctrl' was called to determine the local advertising
options, but these were determined based on FLOW_CTRL_RX/TX flags which are
never set through ethtool.
The patch simply translates from ethtool flow options to mii flow options.
