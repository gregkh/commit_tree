rtc: omap: silence bogus power-up reset message at probe

Some legacy RTC IP revisions has a power-up reset flag in the status
register that later revisions lack.

As this flag is always read back as set on later revisions (or is
overloaded with a different flag), make sure to only clear the flag and
print the info message on legacy platforms.
