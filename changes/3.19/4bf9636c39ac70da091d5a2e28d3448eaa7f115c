Revert "ARM: 7830/1: delay: don't bother reporting bogomips in /proc/cpuinfo"

Commit 9fc2105aeaaf ("ARM: 7830/1: delay: don't bother reporting
bogomips in /proc/cpuinfo") breaks audio in python, and probably
elsewhere, with message

  FATAL: cannot locate cpu MHz in /proc/cpuinfo

I'm not the first one to hit it, see for example

  https://devtalk.nvidia.com/default/topic/765800/workaround-for-fatal-cannot-locate-cpu-mhz-in-proc-cpuinf/?offset=1

Reading original changelog, I have to say "Stop breaking working setups.
You know who you are!".
