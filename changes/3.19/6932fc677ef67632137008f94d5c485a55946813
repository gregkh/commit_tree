vmw_pvscsi: fixup tagging

The request (and SCSI command) tag is the tag number assigned
by the generic block-tagging code, not the SCSI-II tag messages.
Those are represented by the device flags 'tagged_supported',
'simple_tags', and 'ordered_tags'.
(The SCSI midlayer doesn't use HEAD_OF_QUEUE tags).
So fixup vmw_pvscsi to assign the correct tag type.

[hch: fixed up to never set MSG_ORDERED_TAG]
