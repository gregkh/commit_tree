arm64/kvm: Fix assembler compatibility of macros

Some of the macros defined in kvm_arm.h are useful in assembly files, but are
not compatible with the assembler.  Change any C language integer constant
definitions using appended U, UL, or ULL to the UL() preprocessor macro.  Also,
add a preprocessor include of the asm/memory.h file which defines the UL()
macro.

Fixes build errors like these when using kvm_arm.h in assembly
source files:

  Error: unexpected characters following instruction at operand 3 -- `and x0,x1,#((1U<<25)-1)'
