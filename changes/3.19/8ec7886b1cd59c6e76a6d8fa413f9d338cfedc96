mac80211: minstrel_ht: use group flags instead of index to display rates

When displaying a rate through debugfs minstrel_ht guesses its flags
comparing group indexes.  Since 3ec373c421b6 ("mac80211: minstrel_ht:
include type (cck/ht) in rates flag"), the rate flags of interest are
present in the mcs_group-s, so use it.
While improving the code, this also fixes a smatch false positive
"error: testing array offset 'i' after use" in minstrel_ht_stats_dump.
This warning only triggers after 9208247d74bc ("mac80211: minstrel_ht:
add basic support for VHT rates <= 3SS@80MHz") with
CONFIG_MAC80211_RC_MINSTREL_VHT unset because then MINSTREL_VHT_GROUP_0
is above MINSTREL_GROUPS_NB and smatch only barks when the "testing
array offset" seems to prevent possible out of bonds accesses (which
does not happen here since i < ARRAY_SIZE(mi->groups)).
