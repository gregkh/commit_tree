i40evf: make checkpatch happy

This patch is the result of running checkpatch on the i40evf driver with
the --strict option. The vast majority of changes are adding/removing
blank lines, aligning function parameters, and correcting over-long
lines.

The only possible functional change is changing the flags member of the
adapter structure to be non-volatile. However, according to the kernel
documentation, this is not necessary and the volatile should be removed.
