tracing: Do not check return values of trace_seq_p*() for mmio tracer

The return values for trace_seq_printf() and friends are going to be
removed and they will become void functions. The mmio tracer checked
their return and even did so incorrectly.

Some of the funtions which returned the values were never checked
themselves. Removing all the checks simplifies the code.

Use trace_seq_has_overflowed() and trace_handle_return() where
necessary instead.
