tipc: drop tx side permission checks

Part of the old remote management feature is a piece of code
that checked permissions on the local system to see if a certain
operation was permitted, and if so pass the command to a remote
node. This serves no purpose after the removal of remote management
with commit 5902385a2440 ("tipc: obsolete the remote management
feature") so we remove it.
