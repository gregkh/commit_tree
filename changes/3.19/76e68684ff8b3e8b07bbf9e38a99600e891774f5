ARM: dts: imx6qdl-sabresd: Fix the microphone route

Since commit e409dfbfccf9a49 ("ASoC: dapm: Add a few supply widget sanity
checks") the following error is seen:

imx-wm8962 sound: wm8962 <-> 202c000.ssi mapping ok
imx-wm8962 sound: Connecting non-supply widget to supply widget is not supported (AMIC -> MICBIAS)
imx-wm8962 sound: ASoC: no dapm match for AMIC --> (null) --> MICBIAS
imx-wm8962 sound: ASoC: Failed to add route AMIC -> direct -> MICBIAS

Invert the route between the microphone and the bias in order to fix it.

While at it, align the audio routing with imx6sl-evk and imx6sx-sdb, which have
the same wm8962 circuitry.
