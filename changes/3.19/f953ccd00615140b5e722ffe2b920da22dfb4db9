exit: wait: don't use zombie->real_parent

1. wait_task_zombie() uses p->real_parent to get psig/siglock. This is
   correct but needs tasklist_lock, ->real_parent can exit.

   We can use "current" instead. This is our natural child, its parent
   must be our sub-thread.

2. Read psig/sig outside of ->siglock, ->signal is no longer protected
   by this lock.

3. Fix the outdated comments about tasklist_lock. We can not race with
   __exit_signal(), the whole thread group is dead, nobody but us can
   call it.

   Also clarify the usage of ->stats_lock and ->siglock.

Note: thread_group_cputime_adjusted() is sub-optimal in this case, we
probably want to export cputime_adjust() to avoid thread_group_cputime().
The comment says "all threads" but there are no other threads.
