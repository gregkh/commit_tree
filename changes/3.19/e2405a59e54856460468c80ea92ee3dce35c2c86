ARM: dts: rk3288: add arm,cpu-registers-not-fw-configured

This will enable use of physical arch timers on rk3288, where each
core comes out of reset with a different virtual offset.  Using
physical timers will help with SMP booting on coreboot and older
u-boot and should also allow suspend-resume and cpu-hotplug to work on
all firmwares.

Firmware which does initialize the cpu registers properly at boot and
cpu-hotplug can remove this property from the device tree.
