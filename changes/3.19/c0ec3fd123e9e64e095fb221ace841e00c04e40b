tty: serial: bcm63xx: Allow bcm63xx_uart to be built on other platforms

This device was originally supported on bcm63xx only, but it shows up on
a wide variety of MIPS and ARM chipsets spanning multiple product lines.
Now that the driver has eliminated dependencies on bcm63xx-specific
header files, we can build it on any non-bcm63xx kernel.

Compile-tested on x86, both statically and as a module.  Tested for
functionality on bcm3384 (a new MIPS platform under active development).
