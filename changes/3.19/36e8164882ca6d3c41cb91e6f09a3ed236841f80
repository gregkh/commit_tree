PCI: Restore detection of read-only BARs

Commit 6ac665c63dca ("PCI: rewrite PCI BAR reading code") masked off
low-order bits from 'l', but not from 'sz'.  Both are passed to pci_size(),
which compares 'base == maxbase' to check for read-only BARs.  The masking
of 'l' means that comparison will never be 'true', so the check for
read-only BARs no longer works.

Resolve this by also masking off the low-order bits of 'sz' before passing
it into pci_size() as 'maxbase'.  With this change, pci_size() will once
again catch the problems that have been encountered to date:

  - AGP aperture BAR of AMD-7xx host bridges: if the AGP window is
    disabled, this BAR is read-only and read as 0x00000008 [1]

  - BARs 0-4 of ALi IDE controllers can be non-zero and read-only [1]

  - Intel Sandy Bridge - Thermal Management Controller [8086:0103];
    BAR 0 returning 0xfed98004 [2]

  - Intel Xeon E5 v3/Core i7 Power Control Unit [8086:2fc0];
    Bar 0 returning 0x00001a [3]
