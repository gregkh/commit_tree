Revert "powerpc: Secondary CPUs must set cpu_callin_map after setting active and online"

This reverts commit 7c5c92ed56d932b2c19c3f8aea86369509407d33.

Although this did fix the bug it was aimed at, it also broke secondary
startup on platforms that use give/take_timebase(). Unfortunately we
didn't detect that while it was in next.
