UBI: Extend UBI layer debug/messaging capabilities

If there is more then one UBI device mounted, there is no way to
distinguish between messages from different UBI devices.
Add device number to all ubi layer message types.

The R/O block driver messages were replaced by pr_* since
ubi_device structure is not used by it.

Amended a bit by Artem.
