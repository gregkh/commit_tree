Timestamp => timestamp
PartitionNumber => partition_number
VirtualProcessorNumber => vcpu_number
LogicalProcessorNumber => lcpu_number

Subsystem => subsystem
Reserved0 => reserved0
BlockNumber => block_no
BlockNumberHigh => block_no_high
EventNumber => event_no
EventNumberHigh => event_no_high
Reserved => reserved
AdditionalInfo => additional_info
