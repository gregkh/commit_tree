x86, ptdump: Add section for EFI runtime services

In commit 3891a04aafd6 ("x86-64, espfix: Don't leak bits 31:16 of %esp
returning..") the "ESPFix Area" was added to the page table dump special
sections. That area, though, has a limited amount of entries printed.

The EFI runtime services are, unfortunately, located in-between the
espfix area and the high kernel memory mapping. Due to the enforced
limitation for the espfix area, the EFI mappings won't be printed in the
page table dump.

To make the ESP runtime service mappings visible again, provide them a
dedicated entry.
