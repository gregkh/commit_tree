spi: meson: Add support for Amlogic Meson SPIFC

This is a driver for the Amlogic Meson SPIFC (SPI flash controller),
which is one of the two SPI controllers available on the SoC. It
doesn't support DMA and has a 64-byte unified transmit/receive buffer.

The device is optimized for interfacing with SPI NOR memories and
allows the execution of standard operations such as read, page
program, sector erase, etc. in a simplified way, toggling a bit in a
dedicated register. The driver doesn't use those predefined commands
and relies only on custom transfers.
