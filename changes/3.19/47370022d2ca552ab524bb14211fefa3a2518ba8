ASoC: wm5102: Initialize dac_comp_lock mutex

Commit d74bcaaeb6682 (ASoC: wm5102: Move ultrasonic response settings
lock to the driver level) created a driver local mutex for protecting
the ultrasonic response settings but neglected to initialize that mutex,
causing loud complaints from lockep and potential runtime failures. Fix
this by initializing the mutex.
