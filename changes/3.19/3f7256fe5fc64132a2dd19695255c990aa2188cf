ASoC: sgtl5000: Use the preferred form for passing a size of a struct

According to Documentation/CodingStyle - Chapter 14:

"The preferred form for passing a size of a struct is the following:

	p = kmalloc(sizeof(*p), ...);

The alternative form where struct name is spelled out hurts readability and
introduces an opportunity for a bug when the pointer variable type is changed
but the corresponding sizeof that is passed to a memory allocator is not."

So do it as recommeded.
