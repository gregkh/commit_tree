blk-mq: add blk_mq_free_hctx_request()

It's silly to use blk_mq_free_request() which in turn maps the
request to the hardware queue, for places where we already know
what the hardware queue is. This saves us an extra mapping of a
hardware queue on request completion, if the caller knows this
information already.
