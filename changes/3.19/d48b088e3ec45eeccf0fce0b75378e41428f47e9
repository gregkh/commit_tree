ASoC: sigmadsp: Restructure in preparation for fw v2 support

The v2 file format of the SigmaDSP takes a more declarative style compared
to the imperative style of the v1 format. In addition some features that are
supported with v2 require the driver to keep state around for the firmware.
This requires a bit of restructuring of both the firmware loader itself and
the drivers making use of the firmware loader.

Instead of loading and executing the firmware in place when the DSP is
configured the firmware is now loaded at driver probe time. This is required
since the new firmware format will in addition to the firmware data itself
contain meta information describing the firmware and its requirements and
capabilities. Those will for example be used to restrict the supported
samplerates advertised by the driver to userspace to the list of samplerates
supported for the firmware.

This only does the restructuring required by the v2 format, but does not
yet add support for the new format itself.
