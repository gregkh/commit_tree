ARM: 8195/1: vfp: Bounce undefined instructions in vectored mode

Certain ARM CPU implementations (e.g. Cortex-A15) may not raise a
floating- point exception whenever deprecated short-vector VFP
instructions are executed. Instead these instructions are treated
as UNALLOCATED. Change the VFP exception handling code to emulate
short-vector instructions even if FPEXC exception bits are not
set.
