can: dev: fix crtlmode_supported check

When changing flags in the CAN drivers ctrlmode the provided new content has to
be checked whether the bits are allowed to be changed. The bits that are to be
changed are given as a bitfield in cm->mask. Therefore checking against
cm->flags is wrong as the content can hold any kind of values.

The iproute2 tool sets the bits in cm->mask and cm->flags depending on the
detected command line options. To be robust against bogus user space
applications additionally sanitize the provided flags with the provided mask.
