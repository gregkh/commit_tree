ACPI / processor: Convert apic_id to phys_id to make it arch agnostic

apic_id in MADT table is the CPU hardware id which identify
it self in the system for x86 and ia64, OSPM will use it for
SMP init to map APIC ID to logical cpu number in the early
boot, when the DSDT/SSDT (ACPI namespace) is scanned later, the
ACPI processor driver is probed and the driver will use acpi_id
in DSDT to get the apic_id, then map to the logical cpu number
which is needed by the processor driver.

Before ACPI 5.0, only x86 and ia64 were supported in ACPI spec,
so apic_id is used both in arch code and ACPI core which is
pretty fine. Since ACPI 5.0, ARM is supported by ACPI and
APIC is not available on ARM, this will confuse people when
apic_id is both used by x86 and ARM in one function.

So convert apic_id to phys_id (which is the original meaning)
in ACPI processor dirver to make it arch agnostic, but leave the
arch dependent code unchanged, no functional change.
