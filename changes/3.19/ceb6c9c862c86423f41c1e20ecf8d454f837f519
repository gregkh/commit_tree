USB / PM: Drop CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME from the USB core

After commit b2b49ccbdd54 (PM: Kconfig: Set PM_RUNTIME if PM_SLEEP is
selected) PM_RUNTIME is always set if PM is set, so quite a few
depend on CONFIG_PM (or even dropped in some cases).

Replace CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME with CONFIG_PM in the USB core code
and documentation.
