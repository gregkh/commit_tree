thermal: Fix cdev registration with THERMAL_NO_LIMIT on 64bit

The size of unsigned long varies between 32 and 64 bit systems while
the size of phandle arguments is always 32 bits per parameter.

On 64-bit systems, cooling devices registered via of-thermal apis fail
to bind when the min/max cooling state is specified as
THERMAL_NO_LIMIT (-1UL) as there is a mis-match between the value read
from the device tree (32bit) and the pre-processor define (64bit).

As we're unlikely to need cooling states larger than 32 bits, and for
consistency with the size of phandle arguments, explicitly limit
THERMAL_NO_LIMIT to 32 bits.
