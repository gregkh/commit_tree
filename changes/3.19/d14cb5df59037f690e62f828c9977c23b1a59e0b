KVM: x86: Emulator mis-decodes VEX instructions on real-mode

Commit 7fe864dc942c (KVM: x86: Mark VEX-prefix instructions emulation as
unimplemented, 2014-06-02) marked VEX instructions as such in protected
mode.  VEX-prefix instructions are not supported relevant on real-mode
and VM86, but should cause #UD instead of being decoded as LES/LDS.

Fix this behaviour to be consistent with real hardware.
