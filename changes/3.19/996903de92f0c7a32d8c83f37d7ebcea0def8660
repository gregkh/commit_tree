mmc: core: add core-level function for sending tuning commands

According to the SD card spec, Add a manual tuning command function
for SDR104/HS200.
Sending command 19 or command 21 to read data and compare with the
tunning block pattern.

This patch will help to decrease some platform private codes in SDHCI
platform_execute_tuning() callbacks.
