s390/zcrypt: kernel oops at insmod of the z90crypt device driver

Kernel oops caused by invalid parameter at TAPQ instruction:
On older systems where the QCI instruction is not available
all possible domains are probed via TAPQ instruction. The
range for the probe has been extended with the > 16 domain
support now leading to a possible specification exception
when this instruction is called for probing higher values
within the new range. This may happen during insmod and/or
ap bus reset only on machines without a QCI instruction (z10,
z196, z114), zEC12 and newer systems are not affected.
The fix modifies the domain checking function to limit the
allowed range if no QCI info is available.
