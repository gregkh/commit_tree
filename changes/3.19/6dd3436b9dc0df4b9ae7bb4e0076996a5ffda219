NFS: SETCLIENTID XDR buffer sizes are incorrect

Use the correct calculation of the maximum size of a clientaddr4
when encoding and decoding SETCLIENTID operations. clientaddr4 is
defined in section 2.2.10 of RFC3530bis-31.

The usage in encode_setclientid_maxsz is missing the 4-byte length
in both strings, but is otherwise correct. decode_setclientid_maxsz
simply asks for a page of receive buffer space, which is
unnecessarily large (more than 4KB).

Note that a SETCLIENTID reply is either clientid+verifier, or
clientaddr4, depending on the returned NFS status. It doesn't
hurt to allocate enough space for both.
