drm/i915: Add the predicate source registers to the register whitelist

The predicate source registers are needed to implement conditional
rendering without stalling. The two source registers are used to load
the previous values of the PS_DEPTH_COUNT register saved from
PIPE_CONTROL commands. These can then be compared and used to set the
predicate enable bit via the MI_PREDICATE command.

The command parser version number is increased to 2 to make it easier
to detect the new functionality in user space.
