ath10k: advertise all possible firmware(-api) files

This is required if we take into account possibility to load the driver
from initrd (RAM disk), so in other words: very early in the boot process,
before the file system is visible.

In such case we need to have the firmware files accessible from ram disk too,
and this patch guarantee this.
