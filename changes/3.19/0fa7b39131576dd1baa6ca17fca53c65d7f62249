nl80211: fix per-station group key get/del and memory leak

In case userspace attempts to obtain key information for or delete a
unicast key, this is currently erroneously rejected unless the driver
sets the WIPHY_FLAG_IBSS_RSN flag. Apparently enough drivers do so it
was never noticed.

Fix that, and while at it fix a potential memory leak: the error path
in the get_key() function was placed after allocating a message but
didn't free it - move it to a better place. Luckily admin permissions
are needed to call this operation.
