ARM: zynq: Actually remove hotplug.c

Commit 'ARM: zynq: Remove hotplug.c'
(caf86a73eab4132f870e883216850d9eee40b04b) was supposed to remove
hotplug.c - but it didn't. It moved all content from
hotplug.c elsewhere and removed its entry from the Makefile, but missed
to actually remove the whole file. Remove it now.
