dm thin: do not allow thin device activation while pool is suspended

Otherwise IO could be issued to the pool while it is suspended.

Care was taken to properly interlock between the thin and thin-pool
targets when accessing the pool's 'suspended' flag.  The thin_ctr will
not add a new thin device to the pool's active_thins list if the pool is
susepended.
