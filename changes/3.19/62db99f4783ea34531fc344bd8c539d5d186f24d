cpu: Avoid puts_pending overflow

A long string of get_online_cpus() with each followed by a
put_online_cpu() that fails to acquire cpu_hotplug.lock can result in
overflow of the cpu_hotplug.puts_pending counter.  Although this is
perhaps improbably, a system with absolutely no CPU-hotplug operations
will have an arbitrarily long time in which this overflow could occur.
This commit therefore adds overflow checks to get_online_cpus() and
try_get_online_cpus().
