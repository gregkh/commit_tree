x86: mm: Re-use the early_ioremap fixed area

The temp fixed area is only used during boot for early_ioremap(), and
it is unused when ioremap() is functional. vmalloc/pkmap area become
available after early boot so the temp fixed area is available for
re-use.

The virtual address is more precious on i386, especially turning on
high memory. So we can re-use the virtual address space.

Remove the now unused defines FIXADDR_BOOT_START and FIXADDR_BOOT_SIZE.
