mmc: sdhci: Fix sleep in atomic after inserting SD card

Sleep in atomic context happened on Trats2 board after inserting or
removing SD card because mmc_gpio_get_cd() was called under spin lock.

Fix this by moving card detection earlier, before acquiring spin lock.
The mmc_gpio_get_cd() call does not have to be protected by spin lock
because it does not access any sdhci internal data.
The sdhci_do_get_cd() call access host flags (SDHCI_DEVICE_DEAD). After
moving it out side of spin lock it could theoretically race with driver
removal but still there is no actual protection against manual card
eject.
