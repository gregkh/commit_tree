x86/tsc: Change Fast TSC calibration failed from error to info

Many users see this message when booting without knowning that it is
of no importance and that TSC calibration may have succeeded by
another way.

As explained by Paul Bolle in
http://lkml.kernel.org/r/1348488259.1436.22.camel@x61.thuisdomein

  "Fast TSC calibration failed" should not be considered as an error
  since other calibration methods are being tried afterward. At most,
  those send a warning if they fail (not an error). So let's change
  the message from error to warning.

[ tglx: Make if pr_info. It's really not important at all ]
