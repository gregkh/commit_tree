debugfs: Have debugfs_print_regs32() return void

The seq_printf() will soon just return void, and seq_has_overflowed()
should be used instead to see if the seq can no longer accept input.

As the return value of debugfs_print_regs32() has no users and
the seq_file descriptor should be checked with seq_has_overflowed()
instead of return values of functions, it is better to just have
debugfs_print_regs32() also return void.
