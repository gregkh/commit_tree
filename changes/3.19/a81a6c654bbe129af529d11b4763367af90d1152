ARM: dt: fix up PL011 device tree bindings

Make the map match the reality, the current binding text is
nonsense:

- The clock required for the clocking of the serial port
  must come first and is not optional (as the driver will
  otherwise proceed to grab and use the apb_pclk as uartclk),
  and the apb_pclk that clocks the logic must come second
  as the code will retrieve the first clock by index,
  whereas the PrimeCell but will explicitly look for
  "apb_pclk" so this can be specified later, as it is
  looked up by name.

- The pin control state "default" is the only mandated
  state, the sleep state is entirely optional.

We also add an example to avoid further confusion.
