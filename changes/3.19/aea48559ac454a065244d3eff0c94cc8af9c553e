perf/x86: Add support for sampling PEBS machine state registers

PEBS can capture machine state regs at retiremnt of the sampled
instructions. When precise sampling is enabled on an event, PEBS
is used, so substitute the interrupted state with the PEBS state.
Note that not all registers are captured by PEBS. Those missing
are replaced by the interrupt state counter-parts.
