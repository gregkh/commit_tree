ncr5380: Move static PDMA spin counters to host data

Static variables from dtc.c and pas16.c should not appear in the core
NCR5380.c driver. Aside from being a layering issue this worsens the
divergence between the three core driver variants (atari_NCR5380.c and
sun3_NCR5380.c don't support PSEUDO_DMA) and it can mean multiple hosts
share the same counters.

Fix this by making the pseudo DMA spin counters in the core more generic.
This also avoids the abuse of the {DTC,PAS16}_PUBLIC_RELEASE macros, so
they can be removed.

oak.c doesn't use PDMA and hence it doesn't use the counters and hence it
needs no write_info() method. Remove it.
