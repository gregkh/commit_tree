[media] coda: add CODA7541 JPEG support

This patch adds JPEG encoding and decoding support for CODA7541,
using the BIT processor. Separate JPEG encoder and decoder video
devices are created due to different streaming behaviour and
different supported pixel formats.
The hardware can not change subsampling on the fly, but encode
and decode 4:2:2 subsampled JPEG images from and into this format.

The CODA7541 JPEG decoder uses the bitstream buffer and thus can run
without new buffers queued if there is a buffer in the bitstream.

Since there is no standard way to store the colorspace used in
JPEGs, and to make v4l2-compliance happy, the JPEG format always
reports V4L2_COLORSPACE_JPEG.
