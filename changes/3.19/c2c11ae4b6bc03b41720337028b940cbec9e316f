rtc/lib: Provide y2038 safe rtc_tm_to_time()/rtc_time_to_tm() replacement

As part of addressing "y2038 problem" for in-kernel uses, this patch
adds safe rtc_tm_to_time64()/rtc_time64_to_tm() respectively using
time64_t.

After this patch, rtc_tm_to_time() is deprecated and all its call
sites will be fixed using corresponding safe versions, it can be
removed when having no users. Also change rtc_tm_to_time64() to
return time64_t directly instead of just as a parameter like
rtc_tm_to_time() does.

After this patch, rtc_time_to_tm() is deprecated and all its call
sites will be fixed using corresponding safe versions, it can be
removed when having no users.

In addition, change rtc_tm_to_ktime() and rtc_ktime_to_tm() to use
the safe version in passing.
