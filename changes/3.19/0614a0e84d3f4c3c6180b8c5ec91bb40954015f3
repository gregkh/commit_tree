staging: vt6655: mac80211 conversion: changes to CARDbSetPhyParameter

CARDbSetPhyParameter appears to use two different strutures to find supported
rates.

Remove PWLAN_IE_SUPP_RATES and use basic_rates to find rates supported.

mac80211 now sets bShortSlotTime, bBarkerPreambleMd and byPreambleType remove
these.
