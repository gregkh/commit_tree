init: fix read-write root mount

If mount flags don't have MS_RDONLY, iso9660 returns EACCES without actually
checking if it's an iso image.

This tricks mount_block_root() into retrying with MS_RDONLY.  This results
in a read-only root despite the "rw" boot parameter if the actual
filesystem was checked after iso9660.

I believe the behavior of iso9660 is okay, while that of mount_block_root()
is not.  It should rather try all types without MS_RDONLY and only then
retry with MS_RDONLY.

This change also makes the code more robust against the case when EACCES is
returned despite MS_RDONLY, which would've resulted in a lockup.
