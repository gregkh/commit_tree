ip: zero sockaddr returned on error queue

The sockaddr is returned in IP(V6)_RECVERR as part of errhdr. That
structure is defined and allocated on the stack as

    struct {
            struct sock_extended_err ee;
            struct sockaddr_in(6)    offender;
    } errhdr;

The second part is only initialized for certain SO_EE_ORIGIN values.
Always initialize it completely.

An MTU exceeded error on a SOCK_RAW/IPPROTO_RAW is one example that
would return uninitialized bytes.

Also verified that there is no padding between errhdr.ee and
errhdr.offender that could leak additional kernel data.
