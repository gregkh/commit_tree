Bluetooth: Pass only crypto context to SMP crypto functions

In order to make unit testing possible we need to make the SMP crypto
functions only take the crypto context instead of the full SMP context
(the latter would require having hci_dev, hci_conn, l2cap_chan,
l2cap_conn, etc around). The drawback is that we no-longer get the
involved hdev in the debug logs, but this is really the only way to make
simple unit tests for the code.
