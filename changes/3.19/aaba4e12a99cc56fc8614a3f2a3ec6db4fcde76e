perf symbols: Move bfd_demangle stubbing to its only user

We need to define bfd_demangle() to either a wrapper for
cplus_demangle() or to a stub when NO_DEMANGLE is defined.

That is at odds with using bfd.h for some other reason, as it defines
bfd_demangle() and then if code that wants to use symbol.h, where the
above stubbing/wrapping is done, and bfd.h for other reasons, we end up
with a build error where bfd_demangle() is found to be redefined.

Avoid that by moving the stubbing/wrapping to symbol-elf.c, that is the
only user of such function. If we ever get to a point where there are
more valid users, we can then introduce a header for that.
