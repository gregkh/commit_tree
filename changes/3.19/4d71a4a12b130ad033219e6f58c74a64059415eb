leds: Add support for setting brightness in a synchronous way

There are use cases when setting a LED brightness has to
have immediate effect (e.g. setting a torch LED brightness).
This patch extends LED subsystem to support such operations.
The LED subsystem internal API __led_set_brightness is changed
to led_set_brightness_async and new led_set_brightness_sync API
is added.
