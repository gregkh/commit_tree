hpsa: get rid of type/attribute/direction bit field where possible

Using bit fields for hardware command fields isn't portable and
relies on assumptions about how the compiler lays out the bits.
We can fix this in the driver's internal command structure, but the
ioctl interface we can't change because it is part of the
userland ABI.
