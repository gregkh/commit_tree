Btrfs: avoid premature -ENOMEM in clear_extent_bit()

We try to allocate an extent state structure before acquiring the extent
state tree's spinlock as we might need a new one later and therefore avoid
doing later an atomic allocation while holding the tree's spinlock. However
we returned -ENOMEM if that initial non-atomic allocation failed, which is
a bit excessive since we might end up not needing the pre-allocated extent
state at all - for the case where the tree doesn't have any extent states
that cover the input range and cover too any other range. Therefore don't
return -ENOMEM if that pre-allocation fails.
