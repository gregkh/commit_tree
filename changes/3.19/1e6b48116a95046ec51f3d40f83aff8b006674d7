ARM: mm: allow non-text sections to be non-executable

Adds CONFIG_ARM_KERNMEM_PERMS to separate the kernel memory regions
into section-sized areas that can have different permisions. Performs
the NX permission changes during free_initmem, so that init memory can be
reclaimed.

This uses section size instead of PMD size to reduce memory lost to
padding on non-LPAE systems.

Based on work by Brad Spengler, Larry Bassel, and Laura Abbott.
