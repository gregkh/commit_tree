mnt: Clear mnt_expire during pivot_root

When inspecting the pivot_root and the current mount expiry logic I
realized that pivot_root fails to clear like mount move does.

Add the missing line in case someone does the interesting feat of
moving an expirable submount.  This gives a strong guarantee that root
of the filesystem tree will never expire.
