sched_show_task: fix unsafe usage of ->real_parent

rcu_read_lock() can not protect p->real_parent if release_task(p) was
already called, change sched_show_task() to check pis_alive() like other
users do.

Note: we need some helpers to cleanup the code like this.  And it seems
that that the usage of cpu_curr(cpu) in dump_cpu_task() is not safe too.
