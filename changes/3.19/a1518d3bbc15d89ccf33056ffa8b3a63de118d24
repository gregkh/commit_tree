PM / Kconfig: Do not select PM directly from Kconfig files

It is not valid to select CONFIG_PM directly without selecting
CONFIG_PM_SLEEP or CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME too, because that breaks
dependencies (ia64 does that) and it is not necessary to select
CONFIG_PM directly if CONFIG_PM_SLEEP or CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is
selected, because CONFIG_PM will be set automatically in that
case (sh does that).

Fix those mistakes.
