sched/numa: Calculate node scores in complex NUMA topologies

In order to do task placement on systems with complex NUMA topologies,
it is necessary to count the faults on nodes nearby the node that is
being examined for a potential move.

In case of a system with a backplane interconnect, we are dealing with
groups of NUMA nodes; each of the nodes within a group is the same number
of hops away from nodes in other groups in the system. Optimal placement
on this topology is achieved by counting all nearby nodes equally. When
comparing nodes A and B at distance N, nearby nodes are those at distances
smaller than N from nodes A or B.

Placement strategy on a system with a glueless mesh NUMA topology needs
to be different, because there are no natural groups of nodes determined
by the hardware. Instead, when dealing with two nodes A and B at distance
N, N >= 2, there will be intermediate nodes at distance < N from both nodes
A and B. Good placement can be achieved by right shifting the faults on
nearby nodes by the number of hops from the node being scored. In this
context, a nearby node is any node less than the maximum distance in the
system away from the node. Those nodes are skipped for efficiency reasons,
there is no real policy reason to do so.

Placement policy on directly connected NUMA systems is not affected.
