soc: amlogic: meson-ee-pwrc: add support for the Meson GX SoCs

Add support for the Meson GX SoCs to the meson-ee-pwrc driver.

The power domains on the GX SoCs are very similar to G12A. The only
known differences so far are:
- The GX SoCs do not have the HHI_VPU_MEM_PD_REG2 register (for the
  VPU power-domain)
- The GX SoCs have an additional reset line called "dvin"
