powerpc/watchpoint: Use loop for thread_struct->ptrace_bps

ptrace_bps is already an array of size HBP_NUM_MAX. But we use
hardcoded index 0 while fetching/updating it. Convert such code
to loop over array.

ptrace interface to use multiple watchpoint remains same. eg:
two PPC_PTRACE_SETHWDEBUG calls will create two watchpoint if
underneath hw supports it.
