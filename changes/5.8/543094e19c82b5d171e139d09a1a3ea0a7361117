nvdimm/region: always show the 'align' attribute

It is possible that a platform that is capable of 'namespace labels'
comes up without the labels properly initialized. In this case, the
region's 'align' attribute is hidden. Howerver, once the user does
initialize he labels, the 'align' attribute still stays hidden, which is
unexpected.

The sysfs_update_group() API is meant to address this, and could be
called during region probe, but it has entanglements with the device
'lockdep_mutex'. Therefore, simply make the 'align' attribute always
visible. It doesn't matter what it says for label-less namespaces, since
it is not possible to change their allocation anyway.
