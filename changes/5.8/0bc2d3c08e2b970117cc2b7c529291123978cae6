btrfs: remove useless check for copy_items() return value

At btrfs_log_prealloc_extents() we are checking if copy_items() returns a
value greater than 0. That used to happen in the past to signal the caller
that the path given to it was released and reused for other searches, but
as of commit 0e56315ca147b3 ("Btrfs: fix missing hole after hole punching
and fsync when using NO_HOLES"), the copy_items() function does not have
that behaviour anymore and always returns 0 or a negative value. So just
remove that check at btrfs_log_prealloc_extents(), which the previously
mentioned commit forgot to remove.
