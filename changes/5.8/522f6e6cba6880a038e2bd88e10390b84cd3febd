ovl: fix out of bounds access warning in ovl_check_fb_len()

syzbot reported out of bounds memory access from open_by_handle_at()
with a crafted file handle that looks like this:

  { .handle_bytes = 2, .handle_type = OVL_FILEID_V1 }

handle_bytes gets rounded down to 0 and we end up calling:
  ovl_check_fh_len(fh, 0) => ovl_check_fb_len(fh + 3, -3)

But fh buffer is only 2 bytes long, so accessing struct ovl_fb at
fh + 3 is illegal.
