mips: MAAR: Add XPA mode support

When XPA mode is enabled the normally 32-bits MAAR pair registers
are extended to be of 64-bits width as in pure 64-bits MIPS
architecture. In this case the MAAR registers can enable the
speculative loads/stores for addresses of up to 39-bits width.
But in this case the process of the MAAR initialization changes a bit.
The upper 32-bits of the registers are supposed to be accessed by mean
of the dedicated instructions mfhc0/mthc0 and there is a CP0.MAAR.VH
bit which should be set together with CP0.MAAR.VL as indication
of the boundary validity. All of these peculiarities were taken into
account in this commit so the speculative loads/stores would work
when XPA mode is enabled.
