Revert "serial: core: Refactor uart_unlock_and_check_sysrq()"

This reverts commit da9a5aa3402db0ff3b57216d8dbf2478e1046cae.

In order to ease backporting a fix for a sysrq regression, revert this
rewrite which was since added on top.

The other sysrq helpers now bail out early when sysrq is not enabled;
it's better to keep that pattern here as well.

Note that the __releases() attribute won't be needed after the follow-on
fix either.
