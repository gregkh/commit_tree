habanalabs: add gaudi asic registers header files

Add the relevant GAUDI ASIC registers header files. These files are
generated automatically from a tool maintained by the VLSI engineers.

There are more files which are not upstreamed because only very few defines
from those files are used in the driver. For those files, we copied the
relevant defines into gaudi_regs.h and gaudi_masks.h, to reduce the size of
this patch.
