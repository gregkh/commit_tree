staging: qlge: Remove print statement for vlgrp field

Remove statement that tries to print the non-existent 'vlgrp' field
in the 'ql_adapter' struct, which causes a compilation failure when
QL_DEV_DUMP is set.

vlgrp seems to have been removed from ql_adapter as a part of
commit 18c49b91777c ("qlge: do vlan cleanup") in 2011.

vlgrp might be replaced by the 'active_vlans' array introduced in the
aforementioned commit. But I'm not sure if printing all 64 values of
that array would help with debugging this driver, so I'm leaving it
out of the debug code in this patch.
