scsi: mptscsih: Fix read sense data size

The sense data buffer in sense_buf_pool is allocated with size of
MPT_SENSE_BUFFER_ALLOC(64) (multiplied by req_depth) while SNS_LEN(sc)(96)
is used when reading the data.  That may lead to a read from unallocated
area, sometimes from another (unallocated) page.  To fix this, limit the
read size to MPT_SENSE_BUFFER_ALLOC.
