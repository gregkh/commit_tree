x86/purgatory: Disable various profiling and sanitizing options

Since the purgatory is a special stand-alone binary, various profiling
and sanitizing options must be disabled. Having these options enabled
typically will cause dependencies on various special symbols exported by
special libs / stubs used by these frameworks. Since the purgatory is
special, it is not linked against these stubs causing missing symbols in
the purgatory if these options are not disabled.

Sync the set of disabled profiling and sanitizing options with that from
drivers/firmware/efi/libstub/Makefile, adding
-DDISABLE_BRANCH_PROFILING to the CFLAGS and setting:

  GCOV_PROFILE                    := n
  UBSAN_SANITIZE                  := n

This fixes broken references to ftrace_likely_update() when
CONFIG_TRACE_BRANCH_PROFILING is enabled and to __gcov_init() and
__gcov_exit() when CONFIG_GCOV_KERNEL is enabled.
