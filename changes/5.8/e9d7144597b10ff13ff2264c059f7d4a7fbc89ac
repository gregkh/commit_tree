x86/cpu: Add a steppings field to struct x86_cpu_id

Intel uses the same family/model for several CPUs. Sometimes the
stepping must be checked to tell them apart.

On x86 there can be at most 16 steppings. Add a steppings bitmask to
x86_cpu_id and a X86_MATCH_VENDOR_FAMILY_MODEL_STEPPING_FEATURE macro
and support for matching against family/model/stepping.
