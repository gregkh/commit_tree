PM: runtime: Replace pm_runtime_callbacks_present()

The name of pm_runtime_callbacks_present() is confusing, because
it suggests that the device has PM-runtime callbacks if 'true' is
returned by that function, but in fact that may not be the case,
so replace it with pm_runtime_has_no_callbacks() which is not
ambiguous.

No functional impact.
