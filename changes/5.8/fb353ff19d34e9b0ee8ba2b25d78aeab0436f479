xfs: reserve quota inode transaction space only when needed

We share an inode between gquota and pquota with the older
superblock that doesn't have separate pquotino, and for the
need_alloc == false case we don't need to call xfs_dir_ialloc()
function, so add the check if reserved free disk blocks is
needed.
