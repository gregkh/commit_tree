firmware: smccc: Drop smccc_version enum and use ARM_SMCCC_VERSION_1_x instead

Instead of maintaining 2 sets of enums/macros for tracking SMCCC version,
let us drop smccc_version enum and use ARM_SMCCC_VERSION_1_x directly
instead.

This is in preparation to drop smccc_version here and move it separately
under drivers/firmware/smccc.
