x86/fpu/xstate: Update sanitize_restored_xstate() for supervisor xstates

The function sanitize_restored_xstate() sanitizes user xstates of an XSAVE
buffer by clearing bits not in the input 'xfeatures' from the buffer's
header->xfeatures, effectively resetting those features back to the init
state.

When supervisor xstates are introduced, it is necessary to make sure only
user xstates are sanitized.  Ensure supervisor bits in header->xfeatures
stay set and supervisor states are not modified.

To make names clear, also:

- Rename the function to sanitize_restored_user_xstate().
- Rename input parameter 'xfeatures' to 'user_xfeatures'.
- In __fpu__restore_sig(), rename 'xfeatures' to 'user_xfeatures'.
