nvmem: qfprom: remove incorrect write support

qfprom has different address spaces for read and write. Reads are
always done from corrected address space, where as writes are done
on raw address space.
Writing to corrected address space is invalid and ignored, so it
does not make sense to have this support in the driver which only
supports corrected address space regions at the moment.
