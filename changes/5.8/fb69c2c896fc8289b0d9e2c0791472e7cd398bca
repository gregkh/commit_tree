virtio-balloon: Disable free page reporting if page poison reporting is not enabled

We should disable free page reporting if page poisoning is enabled but we
cannot report it via the balloon interface. This way we can avoid the
possibility of corrupting guest memory. Normally the page poisoning feature
should always be present when free page reporting is enabled on the
hypervisor, however this allows us to correctly handle a case of the
virtio-balloon device being possibly misconfigured.
