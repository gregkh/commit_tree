MIPS: VDSO: Move disabling the VDSO logic to Kconfig

After commit 9553d16fa671 ("init/kconfig: Add LD_VERSION Kconfig"), we
have access to GNU ld's version at configuration time. As a result, we
can make it clearer under what configuration circumstances the MIPS VDSO
needs to be disabled.

This is a prerequisite for getting rid of the MIPS VDSO binutils
warning and linking the VDSO when LD is ld.lld. Wrapping the call to
ld-ifversion with CONFIG_LD_IS_LLD does not work because the config
values are wiped away during 'make clean'.
