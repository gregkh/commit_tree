nvme-rdma: add metadata/T10-PI support

For capable HCAs (e.g. ConnectX-5/ConnectX-6) this will allow end-to-end
protection information passthrough and validation for NVMe over RDMA
transport. Metadata offload support was implemented over the new RDMA
signature verbs API and it is enabled for capable controllers.
