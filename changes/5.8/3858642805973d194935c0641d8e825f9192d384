mips: csrc-r4k: Mark R4K timer as unstable if CPU freq changes

Commit 07d69579e7fe ("MIPS: Don't register r4k sched clock when CPUFREQ
enabled") disabled the r4k-clock usage for scheduler ticks counting due
to the scheduler being non-tolerant for unstable clocks sources. For the
same reason the clock should be used in the system clocksource framework
with care. As soon as CPU frequency changes the clocksource framework
should be notified about this by marking the R4K timer being unstable
(which it really is, since the ticks rate has been changed synchronously
with the CPU frequency).
