samples, bpf: Refactor pointer error check with libbpf

Current method of checking pointer error is not user friendly.
Especially the __must_check define makes this less intuitive.

Since, libbpf has an API libbpf_get_error() which checks pointer error,
this commit refactors existing pointer error check logic with libbpf.
