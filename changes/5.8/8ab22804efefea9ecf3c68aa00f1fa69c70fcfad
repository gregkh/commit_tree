x86/fpu/xstate: Define new macros for supervisor and user xstates

XCNTXT_MASK is 'all supported xfeatures' before introducing supervisor
xstates.  Rename it to XFEATURE_MASK_USER_SUPPORTED to make clear that
these are user xstates.

Replace XFEATURE_MASK_SUPERVISOR with the following:
- XFEATURE_MASK_SUPERVISOR_SUPPORTED: Currently nothing.  ENQCMD and
  Control-flow Enforcement Technology (CET) will be introduced in separate
  series.
- XFEATURE_MASK_SUPERVISOR_UNSUPPORTED: Currently only Processor Trace.
- XFEATURE_MASK_SUPERVISOR_ALL: the combination of above.
