random32: remove net_rand_state from the latent entropy gcc plugin

It turns out that the plugin right now ends up being really unhappy
about the change from 'static' to 'extern' storage that happened in
commit f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt
and activity").

This is probably a trivial fix for the latent_entropy plugin, but for
now, just remove net_rand_state from the list of things the plugin
worries about.
