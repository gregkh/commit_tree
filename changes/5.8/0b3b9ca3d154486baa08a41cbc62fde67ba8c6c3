tools: bpftool: Make libcap dependency optional

The new libcap dependency is not used for an essential feature of
bpftool, and we could imagine building the tool without checks on
CAP_SYS_ADMIN by disabling probing features as an unprivileged users.

Make it so, in order to avoid a hard dependency on libcap, and to ease
packaging/embedding of bpftool.
