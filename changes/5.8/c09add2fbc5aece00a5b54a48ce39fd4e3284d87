tools/libbpf: Add bpf_iter support

Two new libbpf APIs are added to support bpf_iter:
  - bpf_program__attach_iter
    Given a bpf program and additional parameters, which is
    none now, returns a bpf_link.
  - bpf_iter_create
    syscall level API to create a bpf iterator.

The macro BPF_SEQ_PRINTF are also introduced. The format
looks like:
  BPF_SEQ_PRINTF(seq, "task id %d\n", pid);

This macro can help bpf program writers with
nicer bpf_seq_printf syntax similar to the kernel one.
