selftests/net: report etf errors correctly

The ETF qdisc can queue skbs that it could not pace on the errqueue.

Address a few issues in the selftest

- recv buffer size was too small, and incorrectly calculated
- compared errno to ee_code instead of ee_errno
- missed invalid request error type

v2:
  - fix a few checkpatch --strict indentation warnings
