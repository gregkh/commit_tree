cpuidle: psci: Fixup execution order when entering a domain idle state

Moving forward, platforms are going to need to execute specific "last-man"
operations before a domain idle state can be entered. In one way or the
other, these operations needs to be triggered while walking the
hierarchical topology via runtime PM and genpd, as it's at that point the
last-man becomes known.

Moreover, executing last-man operations needs to be done after the CPU PM
notifications are sent through cpu_pm_enter(), as otherwise it's likely
that some notifications would fail. Therefore, let's re-order the sequence
in psci_enter_domain_idle_state(), so cpu_pm_enter() gets called prior
pm_runtime_put_sync().
