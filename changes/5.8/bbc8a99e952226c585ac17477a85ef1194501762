rds: Prevent kernel-infoleak in rds_notify_queue_get()

rds_notify_queue_get() is potentially copying uninitialized kernel stack
memory to userspace since the compiler may leave a 4-byte hole at the end
of `cmsg`.

In 2016 we tried to fix this issue by doing `= { 0 };` on `cmsg`, which
unfortunately does not always initialize that 4-byte hole. Fix it by using
memset() instead.
