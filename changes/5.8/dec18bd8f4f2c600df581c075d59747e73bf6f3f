mtd: spi-nor: sfdp: prepare BFPT parsing for JESD216 rev D

JESD216 rev D makes BFPT 20 DWORDs. Update the BFPT size define to
reflect that.

The check for rev A or later compared the BFPT header length with the
maximum BFPT length, BFPT_DWORD_MAX. Since BFPT_DWORD_MAX was 16, and so
was the BFPT length for both rev A and B, this check worked fine. But
now, since BFPT_DWORD_MAX is 20, it means this check will also stop BFPT
parsing for rev A or B, since their length is 16.

So, instead check for BFPT_DWORD_MAX_JESD216 to stop BFPT parsing for
the first JESD216 version, and check for BFPT_DWORD_MAX_JESD216B for the
next two versions.
