ALSA: usb-audio: Add Pioneer DJ DJM-900NXS2 support

Pioneer DJ DJM-900NXS2 is a widely used DJ mixer with 2 audio USB
interfaces. Both have a MIDI controller, 10 playback and 12 capture
channels. Audio endpoints are vendor-specific and 3 files need to be
patched. All playback and capture channels work fine with all supported
sample rates (44.1k, 48k, 96k). Patches are attached.
