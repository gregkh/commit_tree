pstore/platform: Pass max_reason to kmesg dump

Add a new member to struct pstore_info for passing information about
kmesg dump maximum reason. This allows a finer control of what kmesg
dumps are sent to pstore storage backends.

Those backends that do not explicitly set this field (keeping it equal to
0), get the default behavior: store only Oopses and Panics, or everything
if the printk.always_kmsg_dump boot param is set.
