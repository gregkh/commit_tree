Revert "Makefile: install modules.builtin even if CONFIG_MODULES=n"

This reverts commit e0b250b57dcf403529081e5898a9de717f96b76b,
which broke build systems that need to install files to a certain
path, but do not set INSTALL_MOD_PATH when invoking 'make install'.

  $ make INSTALL_PATH=/tmp/destdir install
  mkdir: cannot create directory ‘/lib/modules/5.8.0-rc1+/’: Permission denied
  Makefile:1342: recipe for target '_builtin_inst_' failed
  make: *** [_builtin_inst_] Error 1

While modules.builtin is useful also for CONFIG_MODULES=n, this change
in the behavior is quite unexpected. Maybe "make modules_install"
can install modules.builtin irrespective of CONFIG_MODULES as Jonas
originally suggested.

Anyway, that commit should be reverted ASAP.
