exec: Set the point of no return sooner

Make the code more robust by marking the point of no return sooner.
This ensures that future code changes don't need to worry about how
they return errors if they are past this point.

This results in no actual change in behavior as __do_execve_file does
not force SIGSEGV when there is a pending fatal signal pending past
the point of no return.  Further the only error returns from de_thread
and exec_mmap that can occur result in fatal signals being pending.
