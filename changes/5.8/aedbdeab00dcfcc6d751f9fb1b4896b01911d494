x86/mce: Use untraced rd/wrmsr in the MCE offline/crash check

mce_check_crashing_cpu() is called right at the entry of the MCE
handler. It uses mce_rdmsr() and mce_wrmsr() which are wrappers around
rdmsr() and wrmsr() to handle the MCE error injection mechanism, which is
pointless in this context, i.e. when the MCE hits an offline CPU or the
system is already marked crashing.

The MSR access can also be traced, so use the untraceable variants. This
is also safe vs. XEN paravirt as these MSRs are not affected by XEN PV
modifications.
