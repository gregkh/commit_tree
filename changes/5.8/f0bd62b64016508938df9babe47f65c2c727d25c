ALSA: usb-audio: Improve frames size computation

For computation of the the next frame size current value of fs/fps and
accumulated fractional parts of fs/fps are used, where values are stored
in Q16.16 format. This is quite natural for computing frame size for
asynchronous endpoints driven by explicit feedback, since in this case
fs/fps is a value provided by the feedback endpoint and it's already in
the Q format. If an error is accumulated over time, the device can
adjust fs/fps value to prevent buffer overruns/underruns.

But for synchronous endpoints the accuracy provided by these computations
is not enough. Due to accumulated error the driver periodically produces
frames with incorrect size (+/- 1 audio sample).

This patch fixes this issue by implementing a different algorithm for
frame size computation. It is based on accumulating of the remainders
from division fs/fps and it doesn't accumulate errors over time. This
new method is enabled for synchronous and adaptive playback endpoints.
