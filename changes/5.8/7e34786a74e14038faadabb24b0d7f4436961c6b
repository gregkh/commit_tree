ice: avoid undefined behavior

When writing the driver's struct ice_tlan_ctx structure, do not write the
8-bit element int_q_state with the associated internal-to-hardware field
which is 122-bits, otherwise the helper function ice_write_byte() will use
undefined behavior when setting the mask used for that write.  This should
not cause any functional change and will avoid use of undefined behavior.
Also, update a comment to highlight this structure element is not written.
