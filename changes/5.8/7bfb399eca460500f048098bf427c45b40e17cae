qed: Add XRC to RoCE

Add support for XRC-SRQ's and XRC-QP's for upper layer driver.

We maintain separate bitmaps for resource management for srq and
xrc-srq, However, the range in FW is one, The xrc-srq's are first
and then the srq's follow. Therefore we maintain a srq-id offset.

v2: perform cleanups if XRC bitmpas allocation fail.
