livepatch: Disallow vmlinux.ko

This is purely a theoretical issue, but if there were a module named
vmlinux.ko, the livepatch relocation code wouldn't be able to
distinguish between vmlinux-specific and vmlinux.o-specific KLP
relocations.

If CONFIG_LIVEPATCH is enabled, don't allow a module named vmlinux.ko.
