net: ethernet: ravb: exit if re-initialization fails in tx timeout

According to the report of [1], this driver is possible to cause
the following error in ravb_tx_timeout_work().

ravb e6800000.ethernet ethernet: failed to switch device to config mode

This error means that the hardware could not change the state
from "Operation" to "Configuration" while some tx and/or rx queue
are operating. After that, ravb_config() in ravb_dmac_init() will fail,
and then any descriptors will be not allocaled anymore so that NULL
pointer dereference happens after that on ravb_start_xmit().

To fix the issue, the ravb_tx_timeout_work() should check
the return values of ravb_stop_dma() and ravb_dmac_init().
If ravb_stop_dma() fails, ravb_tx_timeout_work() re-enables TX and RX
and just exits. If ravb_dmac_init() fails, just exits.
