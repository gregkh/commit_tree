khugepaged: add self test

Patch series "thp/khugepaged improvements and CoW semantics", v4.

The patchset adds khugepaged selftest (anon-THP only for now), expands
cases khugepaged can handle and switches anon-THP copy-on-write handling
to 4k.

This patch (of 8):

The test checks if khugepaged is able to recover huge page where we expect
to do so.  It only covers anon-THP for now.

Currently the test shows few failures.  They are going to be addressed by
the following patches.
