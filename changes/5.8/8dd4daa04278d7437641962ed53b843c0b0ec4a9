arm64: mm: reset address tag set by kasan sw tagging

KASAN sw tagging sets a random tag of 8 bits in the top byte of the pointer
returned by the memory allocating functions. So for the functions unaware
of this change, the top 8 bits of the address must be reset which is done
by the function arch_kasan_reset_tag().
