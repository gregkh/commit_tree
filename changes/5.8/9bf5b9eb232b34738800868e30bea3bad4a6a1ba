kernel: move use_mm/unuse_mm to kthread.c

Patch series "improve use_mm / unuse_mm", v2.

This series improves the use_mm / unuse_mm interface by better documenting
the assumptions, and my taking the set_fs manipulations spread over the
callers into the core API.

This patch (of 3):

Use the proper API instead.

These helpers are only for use with kernel threads, and I will tie them
more into the kthread infrastructure going forward.  Also move the
prototypes to kthread.h - mmu_context.h was a little weird to start with
as it otherwise contains very low-level MM bits.
