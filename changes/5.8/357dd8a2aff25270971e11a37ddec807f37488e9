arm64: cpufeature: Add "or" to mitigations for multiple errata

Several actions are not mitigations for a single erratum, but for
multiple errata.  However, printing a line like

    CPU features: detected: ARM errata 1165522, 1530923

may give the false impression that all three listed errata have been
detected.  This can confuse the user, who may think his Cortex-A55 is
suddenly affected by a Cortex-A76 erratum.

Add "or" to all descriptions for mitigations for multiple errata, to
make it clear that only one or more of the errata printed are
applicable, and not necessarily all of them.
