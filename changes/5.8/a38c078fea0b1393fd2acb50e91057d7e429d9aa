mmc: renesas_sdhi: Avoid bad TAP in HS400

With R-Car Gen3, CRC error occue at the following TAPs.

H3, M3W 1.3, M3N... TAP=2,3,6,7
M3W 3.0		... TAP=1,3,5,7

(Note: for 4tap SoCs, the numbers get divided by 2)

Do not use these TAPs in HS400, and also don't use auto correction but
manual correction.

We check for bad taps in two places:

1) After tuning HS400: Then, we select a neighbouring TAP. One of them
   must be good, because there are never three bad taps in a row.
   Retuning won't help because we just finished tuning.

2) After a manual correction request: Here, we can't switch to the
   requested TAP. But we can retune (if the HS200 tuning was good)
   because the environment might have changed since the last tuning.
   If not, we stay on the same TAP.
