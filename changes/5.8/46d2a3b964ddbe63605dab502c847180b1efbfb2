media: place CEC menu before MEDIA_SUPPORT

The only item that opens at the CEC Kconfig menu is related
to Remote Controller. Also, its support should not depend on
media support, so it makes sense to keep both RC and CEC together.

After this change, the main media menus that are visible
under "Device Drivers" menu are:

	<*> Remote Controller support  --->
	[ ] HDMI CEC RC integration (NEW)
	< > HDMI CEC drivers
	<M> Multimedia support  --->
