crypto: lib/sha1 - remove unnecessary includes of linux/cryptohash.h

<linux/cryptohash.h> sounds very generic and important, like it's the
header to include if you're doing cryptographic hashing in the kernel.
But actually it only includes the library implementation of the SHA-1
compression function (not even the full SHA-1).  This should basically
never be used anymore; SHA-1 is no longer considered secure, and there
are much better ways to do cryptographic hashing in the kernel.

Most files that include this header don't actually need it.  So in
preparation for removing it, remove all these unneeded includes of it.
