KVM: nVMX: Skip IBPB when temporarily switching between vmcs01 and vmcs02

Skip the Indirect Branch Prediction Barrier that is triggered on a VMCS
switch when temporarily loading vmcs02 to synchronize it to vmcs12, i.e.
give copy_vmcs02_to_vmcs12_rare() the same treatment as
vmx_switch_vmcs().

Make vmx_vcpu_load() static now that it's only referenced within vmx.c.
