net/mlx5e: Modify uplink state on interface up/down

When setting the PF interface up/down, notify the firmware to update
uplink state via MODIFY_VPORT_STATE, when E-Switch is enabled.

This behavior will prevent sending traffic out on uplink port when PF is
down, such as sending traffic from a VF interface which is still up.
Currently when calling mlx5e_open/close(), the driver only sends PAOS
command to notify the firmware to set the physical port state to
up/down, however, it is not sufficient. When VF is in "auto" state, it
follows the uplink state, which was not updated on mlx5e_open/close()
before this patch.

When switchdev mode is enabled and uplink representor is first enabled,
set the uplink port state value back to its FW default "AUTO".
