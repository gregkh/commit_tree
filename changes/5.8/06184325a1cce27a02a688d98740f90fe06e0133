x86/idt: Annotate alloc_intr_gate() with __init

There seems to be no reason to allocate interrupt gates after init. Mark
alloc_intr_gate() as __init and add WARN_ON() checks making sure it is
only used before idt_setup_apic_and_irq_gates() finalizes IDT setup and
maps all un-allocated entries to spurious entries.
