revert: 1320a4052ea1 ("audit: trigger accompanying records when no rules present")

Unfortunately the commit listed in the subject line above failed
to ensure that the task's audit_context was properly initialized/set
before enabling the "accompanying records".  Depending on the
situation, the resulting audit_context could have invalid values in
some of it's fields which could cause a kernel panic/oops when the
task/syscall exists and the audit records are generated.

We will revisit the original patch, with the necessary fixes, in a
future kernel but right now we just want to fix the kernel panic
with the least amount of added risk.
