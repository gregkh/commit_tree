RDMA/cm: Pull duplicated code into cm_queue_work_unlock()

While unlocking a spinlock held by the caller is a disturbing pattern,
this extensively duplicated code is even worse. Pull all the duplicates
into a function and explain the purpose of the algorithm.

The on creation side call in cm_req_handler() which is different has been
micro-optimized on the basis that the work_count == -1 during creation,
remove that and just use the normal function.
