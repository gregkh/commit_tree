powerpc/vas: Define nx_fault_stamp in coprocessor_request_block

Kernel sets fault address and status in CRB for NX page fault on user
space address after processing page fault. User space gets the signal
and handles the fault mentioned in CRB by bringing the page in to
memory and send NX request again.
