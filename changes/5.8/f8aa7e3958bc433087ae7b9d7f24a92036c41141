KVM: nVMX: Invalidate all EPTP contexts when emulating INVEPT for L1

Free all L2 (guest_mmu) roots when emulating INVEPT for L1.  Outstanding
changes to the EPT tables managed by L1 need to be recognized, and
relying on KVM to always flush L2's EPTP context on nested VM-Enter is
dangerous.

Similar to handle_invpcid(), rely on kvm_mmu_free_roots() to do a remote
TLB flush if necessary, e.g. if L1 has never entered L2 then there is
nothing to be done.

Nuking all L2 roots is overkill for the single-context variant, but it's
the safe and easy bet.  A more precise zap mechanism will be added in
the future.  Add a TODO to call out that KVM only needs to invalidate
affected contexts.
