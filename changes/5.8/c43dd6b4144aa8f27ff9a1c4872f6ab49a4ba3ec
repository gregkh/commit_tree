drm/i915/selftests: Check power consumption at min/max frequencies

A basic premise of RPS is that at lower frequencies, not only do we run
slower, but we save power compared to higher frequencies. For example,
when idle, we set the minimum frequency just in case there is some
residual current. Since the power curve should be a physical
relationship, if we find no power saving it's likely that we've broken
our frequency handling, so test!
