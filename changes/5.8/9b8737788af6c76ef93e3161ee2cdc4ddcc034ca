mlxsw: core: Fix wrong SFP EEPROM reading for upper pages 1-3

Fix wrong reading of upper pages for SFP EEPROM. According to "Memory
Organization" figure in SFF-8472 spec: When reading upper pages 1, 2 and
3 the offset should be set relative to zero and I2C high address 0x51
[1010001X (A2h)] is to be used.
