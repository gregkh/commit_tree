powerpc: Use trap metadata to prevent double restart rather than zeroing trap

It's not very nice to zero trap for this, because then system calls no
longer have trap_is_syscall(regs) invariant, and we can't distinguish
between sc and scv system calls (in a later patch).

Take one last unused bit from the low bits of the pt_regs.trap word
for this instead. There is not a really good reason why it should be
in trap as opposed to another field, but trap has some concept of
flags and it exists. Ideally I think we would move trap to 2-byte
field and have 2 more bytes available independently.

Add a selftests case for this, which can be seen to fail if
trap_norestart() is changed to return false.
