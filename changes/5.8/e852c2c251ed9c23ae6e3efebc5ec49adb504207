mei: bus: don't clean driver pointer

It's not needed to set driver to NULL in mei_cl_device_remove()
which is bus_type remove() handler as this is done anyway
in __device_release_driver().

Actually this is causing an endless loop in driver_detach()
on ubuntu patched kernel, while removing (rmmod) the mei_hdcp module.
The reason list_empty(&drv->p->klist_devices.k_list) is always not-empty.
as the check is always true in  __device_release_driver()
	if (dev->driver != drv)
		return;

The non upstream patch is causing this behavior, titled:
'vfio -- release device lock before userspace requests'

Nevertheless the fix is correct also for the upstream.
