net: hns3: fix for not unmapping TX buffer correctly

When a big TX buffer is sent using multi BD, the driver maps the
whole TX buffer, and unmaps it using info in desc_cb corresponding
to each BD, but only the info in the desc_cb of first BD is correct,
other info in desc_cb is wrong, which causes TX unmapping problem
when SMMU is on.

Only set the mapping and freeing info in the desc_cb of first BD to
fix this problem, because the TX buffer only need to be unmapped and
freed once.
