net: Introduce netns_bpf for BPF programs attached to netns

In order to:

 (1) attach more than one BPF program type to netns, or
 (2) support attaching BPF programs to netns with bpf_link, or
 (3) support multi-prog attach points for netns

we will need to keep more state per netns than a single pointer like we
have now for BPF flow dissector program.

Prepare for the above by extracting netns_bpf that is part of struct net,
for storing all state related to BPF programs attached to netns.

Turn flow dissector callbacks for querying/attaching/detaching a program
into generic ones that operate on netns_bpf. Next patch will move the
generic callbacks into their own module.

This is similar to how it is organized for cgroup with cgroup_bpf.
