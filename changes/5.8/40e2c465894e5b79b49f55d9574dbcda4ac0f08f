ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Clear RIRB status before reading WP

Port commit 6d011d5057ff ("ALSA: hda: Clear RIRB status before reading
WP") from legacy HDA driver to fix the get response timeout issue.
Current SOF driver does not suffer from this issue because sync write
is enabled in hda_init. The issue will come back if the sync write is
disabled for some reason.
