igc: Refactor VLAN priority filtering code

The whole VLAN priority filtering code is implemented in igc_ethtool.c
and mixes logic from ethtool and core parts. This patch refactors it so
core logic is moved to igc_main.c, aligning the VLAN priority filtering
code organization with the MAC address filtering code.

This patch also takes the opportunity to add some log messages to ease
debugging.
