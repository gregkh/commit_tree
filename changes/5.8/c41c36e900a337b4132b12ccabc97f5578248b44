ACPI: video: Use native backlight on Acer TravelMate 5735Z

Currently, changing the brightness of the internal display of the Acer
TravelMate 5735Z does not work. Pressing the function keys or changing the
slider, GNOME Shell 3.36.2 displays the OSD (five steps), but the
brightness does not change.

The Acer TravelMate 5735Z shipped with Windows 7 and as such does not
trigger our "win8 ready" heuristic for preferring the native backlight
interface.

Still ACPI backlight control doesn't work on this model, where as the
native (intel_video) backlight interface does work by adding
`acpi_backlight=native` or `acpi_backlight=none` to Linuxâ€™ command line.

So, add a quirk to force using native backlight control on this model.
