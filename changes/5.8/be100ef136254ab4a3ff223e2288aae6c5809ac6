KVM: VMX: Clean cr3/pgd handling in vmx_load_mmu_pgd()

Rename @cr3 to @pgd in vmx_load_mmu_pgd() to reflect that it will be
loaded into vmcs.EPT_POINTER and not vmcs.GUEST_CR3 when EPT is enabled.
Similarly, load guest_cr3 with @pgd if and only if EPT is disabled.

This fixes one of the last, if not _the_ last, cases in KVM where a
variable that is not strictly a cr3 value uses "cr3" instead of "pgd".
