habanalabs: set 4s timeout for message to device CPU

We see that sometimes the CPU in GOYA and GAUDI is occupied by the
power/thermal loop and can't answer requests from the driver fast enough.

Therefore, to avoid false notifications on timeouts, increase the timeout
to 4 seconds on each message sent to the device CPU.
