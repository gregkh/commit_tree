KVM: nVMX: Skip MMU sync on nested VMX transition when possible

Skip the MMU sync when reusing a cached root if EPT is enabled or L1
enabled VPID for L2.

If EPT is enabled, guest-physical mappings aren't flushed even if VPID
is disabled, i.e. L1 can't expect stale TLB entries to be flushed if it
has enabled EPT and L0 isn't shadowing PTEs (for L1 or L2) if L1 has
EPT disabled.

If VPID is enabled (and EPT is disabled), then L1 can't expect stale TLB
entries to be flushed (for itself or L2).
