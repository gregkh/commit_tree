block: move dma drain handling to scsi

Don't burden the common block code with with specifics of the libata DMA
draining mechanism.  Instead move most of the code to the scsi midlayer.

That also means the nr_phys_segments adjustments in the blk-mq fast path
can go away entirely, given that SCSI never looks at nr_phys_segments
after mapping the request to a scatterlist.
