spi: spi-fsl-qspi: Reduce devm_ioremap size to 4 times AHB buffer size

Reduce devm_ioremap size to (4 * AHB_BUFER_SIZE) rather than mapping
complete QSPI-Memmory as driver is now independent of flash size.
Flash of any size can be accessed.

Issue was reported on platform where devm_ioremap failure is observed
with size > 256M.
Error log on LS1021ATWR :
 fsl-quadspi 1550000.spi: ioremap failed for resource [mem 0x40000000-0x7fffffff]
 fsl-quadspi 1550000.spi: Freescale QuadSPI probe failed
