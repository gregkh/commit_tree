bpf: Add rx_queue_mapping to bpf_sock

Add "rx_queue_mapping" to bpf_sock. This gives read access for the
existing field (sk_rx_queue_mapping) of struct sock from bpf_sock.
Semantics for the bpf_sock rx_queue_mapping access are similar to
sk_rx_queue_get(), i.e the value NO_QUEUE_MAPPING is not allowed
and -1 is returned in that case. This is useful for transmit queue
selection based on the received queue index which is cached in the
socket in the receive path.

v3: Addressed review comments to add usecase in patch description,
    and fixed default value for rx_queue_mapping.
v2: fixed build error for CONFIG_XPS wrapping, reported by
    kbuild test robot <lkp@intel.com>
