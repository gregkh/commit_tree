powerpc/powernv/pci: Sprinkle around some WARN_ON()s

pnv_pci_ioda_configure_bus() should now only ever be called when a device is
added to the bus so add a WARN_ON() to the empty bus check. Similarly,
pnv_pci_ioda_setup_bus_PE() should only ever be called for an unconfigured PE,
so add a WARN_ON() for that case too.
