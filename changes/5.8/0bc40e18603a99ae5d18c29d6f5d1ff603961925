drm/arm: make hdlcd_debugfs_init() return 0

Since commit 987d65d01356 (drm: debugfs: make
drm_debugfs_create_files() never fail), drm_debugfs_create_files() never
fails and should return void. Therefore, remove its use as the
return value of hdlcd_debugfs_init() and have the latter function return
0 directly.

v2: make hdlcd_debugfs_init() return 0 instead of void to ensure that
each patch compiles individually.
