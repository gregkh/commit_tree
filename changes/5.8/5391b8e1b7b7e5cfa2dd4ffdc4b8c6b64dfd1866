SMB3: Honor 'posix' flag for multiuser mounts

The flag from the primary tcon needs to be copied into the volume info
so that cifs_get_tcon will try to enable extensions on the per-user
tcon. At that point, since posix extensions must have already been
enabled on the superblock, don't try to needlessly adjust the mount
flags.

Fixes: b326614ea215 ("smb3: allow "posix" mount option to enable new SMB311 protocol extensions")
