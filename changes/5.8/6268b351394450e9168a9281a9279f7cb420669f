media: Kconfig: fix selection for test drivers

There are some long-time mistakes related to build test
drivers, with regards to depends on/select. Also, as we
now want to build any test driver without needing to
enable anything else, change the logic in order to properly
filter them.

Please notice that the PCI skeleton is somewhat an
exception, as it requires to select *both* SAMPLES and
MEDIA_TEST_SUPPORT. I almost changed it to be either one,
but decided to keep it as-is, as this is something that
we don't really need to be included on any distribution.

The only reason for someone to build it is for COMPILE_TEST
purposes.
