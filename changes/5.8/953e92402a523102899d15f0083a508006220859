perf jvmti: Fix jitdump for methods without debug info

If a Java class is compiled with -g:none to omit debug information, the
JVMTI plugin won't write jitdump entries for any method in this class
and prints a lot of errors like:

    java: GetSourceFileName failed with JVMTI_ERROR_ABSENT_INFORMATION

The call to GetSourceFileName is used to derive the file name `fn`, but
this value is not actually used since commit ca58d7e64bdf ("perf jvmti:
Generate correct debug information for inlined code") which moved the
file name lookup into fill_source_filenames(). So the call to
GetSourceFileName and related code can be safely removed.
