drm/i915/perf: rework aging tail workaround

We're about to introduce an options to open the perf stream, giving
the user ability to configure how often it wants the kernel to poll
the OA registers for available data.

Right now the workaround against the OA tail pointer race condition
requires at least twice the internal kernel polling timer to make any
data available.

This changes introduce checks on the OA data written into the circular
buffer to make as much data as possible available on the first
iteration of the polling timer.

v2: Use OA_TAKEN macro without the gtt_offset (Lionel)
v3: (Umesh)
- Rebase
- Change report to report32 from below review

v4: (Ashutosh, Lionel)
- Fix checkpatch errors
- Fix aging_timestamp initialization
- Check for only one valid landed report
- Fix check for unlanded report
v5: (Ashutosh)
- Fix bug in accurately determining landed report.
- Optimize the check for landed reports by going as far as the
  previously determined aged tail.
