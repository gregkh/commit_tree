ftrace,bug: Improve traceoff_on_warn

While doing some tracing, I found a huge portion of the per-cpu buffer
was taken by printk/serial output because we're disabling the trace far
too late (after printing the CUT string).

Improve matters for architectures that have GENERIC_BUG + _BUG_FLAGS by
killing the tracer in the exception handler before printing anything
much.
