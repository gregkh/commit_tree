dt-bindings: serial: Document CTS/RTS gpios in STM32 UART

Document the use of CTS/RTS gpios for flow control in STM32 UART
controller. These properties can be used instead of 'st,hw-flow-ctrl'
for making use of any gpio pins for flow control instead of dedicated
pins. It should be noted that both CTS/RTS and 'st,hw-flow-ctrl'
properties cannot co-exist in a design.
