io_uring: lazy get task

There will be multiple places where req->task is used, so refcount-pin
it lazily with introduced *io_{get,put}_req_task(). We need to always
have valid ->task for cancellation reasons, but don't care about pinning
it in some cases. That's why it sets req->task in io_req_init() and
implements get/put laziness with a flag.

This also removes using @current from polling io_arm_poll_handler(),
etc., but doesn't change observable behaviour.
