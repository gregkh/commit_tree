scripts/decode_stacktrace: strip basepath from all paths

Currently the basepath is removed only from the beginning of the string.
When the symbol is inlined and there's multiple line outputs of
addr2line, only the first line would have basepath removed.

Change to remove the basepath prefix from all lines.

Fixes: 31013836a71e ("scripts/decode_stacktrace: match basepath using shell prefix operator, not regex")
