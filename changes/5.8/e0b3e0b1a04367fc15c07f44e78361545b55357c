io-mapping: indicate mapping failure

The !ATOMIC_IOMAP version of io_maping_init_wc will always return
success, even when the ioremap fails.

Since the ATOMIC_IOMAP version returns NULL when the init fails, and
callers check for a NULL return on error this is unexpected.

During a device probe, where the ioremap failed, a crash can look like
this:

    BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000210000
     #PF: supervisor write access in kernel mode
     #PF: error_code(0x0002) - not-present page
     Oops: 0002 [#1] PREEMPT SMP
     CPU: 0 PID: 177 Comm:
     RIP: 0010:fill_page_dma [i915]
       gen8_ppgtt_create [i915]
       i915_ppgtt_create [i915]
       intel_gt_init [i915]
       i915_gem_init [i915]
       i915_driver_probe [i915]
       pci_device_probe
       really_probe
       driver_probe_device

The remap failure occurred much earlier in the probe.  If it had been
propagated, the driver would have exited with an error.

Return NULL on ioremap failure.
