parport: fix if-statement empty body warnings

Eliminate warnings by using pr_debug which is the more typical
kernel debugging style and also enable dynamic_debug on these
outputs.

Miscellaneous:

o A few messages were logged at KERN_INFO when enabled, now KERN_DEBUG
o Convert %d/%d to %zd/%zu to avoid compilation warnings
