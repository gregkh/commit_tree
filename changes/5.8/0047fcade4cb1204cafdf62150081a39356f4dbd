KVM: VMX: Move nested EPT out of kvm_x86_ops.get_tdp_level() hook

Separate the "core" TDP level handling from the nested EPT path to make
it clear that kvm_x86_ops.get_tdp_level() is used if and only if nested
EPT is not in use (kvm_init_shadow_ept_mmu() calculates the level from
the passed in vmcs12->eptp).  Add a WARN_ON() to enforce that the
kvm_x86_ops hook is not called for nested EPT.

This sets the stage for snapshotting the non-"nested EPT" TDP page level
during kvm_cpuid_update() to avoid the retpoline associated with
kvm_x86_ops.get_tdp_level() when resetting the MMU, a relatively
frequent operation when running a nested guest.

No functional change intended.
