vhost_net: Also populate XDP frame size

In vhost_net_build_xdp() the 'buf' that gets queued via an xdp_buff
have embedded a struct tun_xdp_hdr (located at xdp->data_hard_start)
which contains the buffer length 'buflen' (with tailroom for
skb_shared_info). Also storing this buflen in xdp->frame_sz, does not
obsolete struct tun_xdp_hdr, as it also contains a struct
virtio_net_hdr with other information.
