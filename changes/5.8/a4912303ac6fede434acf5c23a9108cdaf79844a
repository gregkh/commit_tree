serial: kgdboc: Allow earlycon initialization to be deferred

Currently there is no guarantee that an earlycon will be initialized
before kgdboc tries to adopt it. Almost the opposite: on systems
with ACPI then if earlycon has no arguments then it is guaranteed that
earlycon will not be initialized.

This patch mitigates the problem by giving kgdboc_earlycon a second
chance during console_init(). This isn't quite as good as stopping during
early parameter parsing but it is still early in the kernel boot.
