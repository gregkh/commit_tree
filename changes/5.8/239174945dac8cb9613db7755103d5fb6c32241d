tcp: tcp_v4_err() icmp skb is named icmp_skb

I missed the fact that tcp_v4_err() differs from tcp_v6_err().

After commit 4d1a2d9ec1c1 ("Rename skb to icmp_skb in tcp_v4_err()")
the skb argument has been renamed to icmp_skb only in one function.

I will in a future patch reconciliate these functions to avoid
this kind of confusion.
