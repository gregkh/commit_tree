dpaa2-eth: Add XDP frame size

The dpaa2-eth driver reserve some headroom used for hardware and
software annotation area in RX/TX buffers. Thus, xdp.data_hard_start
doesn't start at page boundary.

When XDP is configured the area reserved via dpaa2_fd_get_offset(fd) is
448 bytes of which XDP have reserved 256 bytes. As frame_sz is
calculated as an offset from xdp_buff.data_hard_start, an adjust from
the full PAGE_SIZE == DPAA2_ETH_RX_BUF_RAW_SIZE.

When doing XDP_REDIRECT, the driver doesn't need this reserved headroom
any-longer and allows xdp_do_redirect() to use it. This is an advantage
for the drivers own ndo-xdp_xmit, as it uses part of this headroom for
itself.  Patch also adjust frame_sz in this case.

The driver cannot support XDP data_meta, because it uses the headroom
just before xdp.data for struct dpaa2_eth_swa (DPAA2_ETH_SWA_SIZE=64),
when transmitting the packet. When transmitting a xdp_frame in
dpaa2_eth_xdp_xmit_frame (call via ndo_xdp_xmit) is uses this area to
store a pointer to xdp_frame and dma_size, which is used in TX
completion (free_tx_fd) to return frame via xdp_return_frame().
