Smack:- Remove mutex lock "smk_lock" from inode_smack

"smk_lock" mutex is used during inode instantiation in
smack_d_instantiate()function. It has been used to avoid
simultaneous access on same inode security structure.
Since smack related initialization is done only once i.e during
inode creation. If the inode has already been instantiated then
smack_d_instantiate() function just returns without doing
anything.

So it means mutex lock is required only during inode creation.
But since 2 processes can't create same inodes or files
simultaneously. Also linking or some other file operation can't
be done simultaneously when the file is getting created since
file lookup will fail before dentry inode linkup which is done
after smack initialization.
So no mutex lock is required in inode_smack structure.

It will save memory as well as improve some performance.
If 40000 inodes are created in system, it will save 1.5 MB on
32-bit systems & 2.8 MB on 64-bit systems.
