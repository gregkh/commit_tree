net/smc: use worker to process incoming llc messages

Incoming llc messages are processed in irq tasklet context, and
a worker is used to send outgoing messages. The worker is needed
because getting a send buffer could result in a wait for a free buffer.

To make sure all incoming llc messages are processed in a serialized way
introduce an event queue and create a new queue entry for each message
which is queued to this event queue. A new worker processes the event
queue entries in order.
And remove the use of a separate worker to send outgoing llc messages
because the messages are processed in worker context already.
With this event queue the serialized llc_wq work queue is obsolete,
remove it.
