sctp: Don't advertise IPv4 addresses if ipv6only is set on the socket

If a socket is set ipv6only, it will still send IPv4 addresses in the
INIT and INIT_ACK packets. This potentially misleads the peer into using
them, which then would cause association termination.

The fix is to not add IPv4 addresses to ipv6only sockets.
