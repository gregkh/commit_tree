ipv6: Fix nexthop refcnt leak when creating ipv6 route info

ip6_route_info_create() invokes nexthop_get(), which increases the
refcount of the "nh".

When ip6_route_info_create() returns, local variable "nh" becomes
invalid, so the refcount should be decreased to keep refcount balanced.

The reference counting issue happens in one exception handling path of
ip6_route_info_create(). When nexthops can not be used with source
routing, the function forgets to decrease the refcnt increased by
nexthop_get(), causing a refcnt leak.

Fix this issue by pulling up the error source routing handling when
nexthops can not be used with source routing.
