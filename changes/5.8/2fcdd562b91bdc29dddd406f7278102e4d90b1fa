Bluetooth: btbcm: Make btbcm_initialize() print local-name on re-init too

Make btbcm_initialize() get and print the device's local-name on re-init
too, this will make us also print the local-name after loading the
Patch on UART attached devices making things more consistent.

This also removes some code duplication from btbcm_setup_patchram()
and allows more code duplication removal there in a follow-up patch.
