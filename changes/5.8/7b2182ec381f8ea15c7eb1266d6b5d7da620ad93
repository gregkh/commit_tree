xprtrdma: Fix handling of RDMA_ERROR replies

The RPC client currently doesn't handle ERR_CHUNK replies correctly.
rpcrdma_complete_rqst() incorrectly passes a negative number to
xprt_complete_rqst() as the number of bytes copied. Instead, set
task->tk_status to the error value, and return zero bytes copied.

In these cases, return -EIO rather than -EREMOTEIO. The RPC client's
finite state machine doesn't know what to do with -EREMOTEIO.

Additional clean ups:
- Don't double-count RDMA_ERROR replies
- Remove a stale comment
