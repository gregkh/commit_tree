powerpc/mm/hash64: use _PAGE_PTE when checking for pte_present

This makes the pte_present check stricter by checking for additional _PAGE_PTE
bit. A level 1 pte pointer (THP pte) can be switched to a pointer to level 0 pte
page table page by following two operations.

1) THP split.
2) madvise(MADV_DONTNEED) in parallel to page fault.

A lockless page table walk need to make sure we can handle such changes
gracefully.
