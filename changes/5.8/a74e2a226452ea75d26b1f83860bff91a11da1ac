docs: debugging-via-ohci1394.txt: add it to the core-api book

There is an special chapter inside the core-api book about
some debug infrastructure like tracepoints and debug objects.

It sounded to me that this is the best place to add a chapter
explaining how to use a FireWire controller to do remote
kernel debugging, as explained on this document.
