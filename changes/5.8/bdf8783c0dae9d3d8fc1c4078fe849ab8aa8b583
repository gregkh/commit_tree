clocksource/drivers/davinci: Avoid trailing '\n' hidden in pr_fmt()

pr_xxx() functions usually have '\n' at the end of the logging message.
Here, this '\n' is added via the 'pr_fmt' macro.

In order to be more consistent with other files, use a more standard
convention and put these '\n' back in the messages themselves and remove it
from the pr_fmt macro.

While at it, remove a useless message in case of 'kzalloc' failure,
especially with a __GFP_NOFAIL flag.
