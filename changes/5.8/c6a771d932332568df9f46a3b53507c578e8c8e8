arm64: csum: Disable KASAN for do_csum()

do_csum() over-reads the source buffer and therefore abuses
READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() to avoid tripping up KASAN. In preparation for
READ_ONCE_NOCHECK() becoming a macro, and therefore losing its
'__no_sanitize_address' annotation, just annotate do_csum() explicitly
and fall back to normal loads.
