mm/gup: might_lock_read(mmap_sem) in get_user_pages_fast()

Instead of scattering these assertions across the drivers, do this
assertion inside the core of get_user_pages_fast*() functions.  That also
includes pin_user_pages_fast*() routines.

Add a might_lock_read(mmap_sem) call to internal_get_user_pages_fast().
