exec: Rename flush_old_exec begin_new_exec

There is and has been for a very long time been a lot more going on in
flush_old_exec than just flushing the old state.  After the movement
of code from setup_new_exec there is a whole lot more going on than
just flushing the old executables state.

Rename flush_old_exec to begin_new_exec to more accurately reflect
what this function does.
