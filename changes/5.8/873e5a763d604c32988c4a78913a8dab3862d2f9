s390/ptrace: fix setting syscall number

When strace wants to update the syscall number, it sets GPR2
to the desired number and updates the GPR via PTRACE_SETREGSET.
It doesn't update regs->int_code which would cause the old syscall
executed on syscall restart. As we cannot change the ptrace ABI and
don't have a field for the interruption code, check whether the tracee
is in a syscall and the last instruction was svc. In that case assume
that the tracer wants to update the syscall number and copy the GPR2
value to regs->int_code.
