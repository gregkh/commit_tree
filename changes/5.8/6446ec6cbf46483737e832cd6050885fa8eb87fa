media: v4l2-subdev: add VIDIOC_SUBDEV_QUERYCAP ioctl

While normal video/radio/vbi/swradio nodes have a proper QUERYCAP ioctl
that apps can call to determine that it is indeed a V4L2 device, there
is currently no equivalent for v4l-subdev nodes. Adding this ioctl will
solve that, and it will allow utilities like v4l2-compliance to be used
with these devices as well.

SUBDEV_QUERYCAP currently returns the version and capabilities of the
subdevice. Define a capability flag to report if the subdevice is
registered in read-only mode.
