media: usb: ttusb-dec: reduce the number of memory reads in ttusb_dec_handle_irq()

In ttusb_dec_handle_irq(), buffer[4] is continuously read from memory
three times, without being modified.
To reduce the number of memory reads, buffer[4] is first assigned to a
local variable index, and then index is used to replace buffer[4].
