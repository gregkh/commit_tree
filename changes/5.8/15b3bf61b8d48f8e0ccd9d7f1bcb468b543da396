soc: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Clear active mode configuration for wake TCS

For RSCs that have sleep & wake TCS but no dedicated active TCS, wake
TCS can be re-purposed to send active requests. Once the active requests
are sent and response is received, the active mode configuration needs
to be cleared so that controller can use wake TCS for sending wake
requests.

Introduce enable_tcs_irq() to enable completion IRQ for repurposed TCSes.
