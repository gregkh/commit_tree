media: dvb: return -EREMOTEIO on i2c transfer failure.

Currently when i2c transfers fail the error return -EREMOTEIO
is assigned to err but then later overwritten when the tuner
attach call is made.  Fix this by returning early with the
error return code -EREMOTEIO on i2c transfer failure errors.

If the transfer fails, an uninitialized value will be read from b2.
