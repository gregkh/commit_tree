arm64: dts: meson: add support for the Smartlabs SML-5442TW

The Smartlabs SML-5442TW is based on the Amlogic P231 reference design
but with the following differences:

- The Yellow and Blue LEDs are available but disabled
- The Red and Green LEDs are used to signal off/on status
- uart_AO can be accessed after opening the case; soldered pins exist
- QCA9377 instead of the usual Ampak/Broadcom module
