kasan: fix clang compilation warning due to stack protector

KASAN uses a single cc-option invocation to disable both conserve-stack
and stack-protector flags.  The former flag is not present in Clang,
which causes cc-option to fail, and results in stack-protector being
enabled.

Fix by using separate cc-option calls for each flag.  Also collect all
flags in a variable to avoid calling cc-option multiple times for
different files.
