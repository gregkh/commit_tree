btrfs: unify buffered and direct I/O read repair

Currently, direct I/O has its own versions of bio_readpage_error() and
btrfs_check_repairable() (dio_read_error() and
btrfs_check_dio_repairable(), respectively). The main difference is that
the direct I/O version doesn't do read validation. The rework of direct
I/O repair makes it possible to do validation, so we can get rid of
btrfs_check_dio_repairable() and combine bio_readpage_error() and
dio_read_error() into a new helper, btrfs_submit_read_repair().
