xfs: acquire ->ail_lock from xfs_trans_ail_delete()

Several callers acquire the lock just prior to the call. Callers
that require ->ail_lock for other purposes already check IN_AIL
state and thus don't require the additional shutdown check in the
helper. Push the lock down into xfs_trans_ail_delete(), open code
the instances that still acquire it, and remove the unnecessary ailp
parameter.
