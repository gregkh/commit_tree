ARM: dts: Configure system timers for omap3

We can now init system timers using the dmtimer and 32k counter
based on only devicetree data and drivers/clocksource timers.
Let's configure the clocksource and clockevent, and drop the old
unused platform data.

As we're just dropping platform data, and the early platform data
init is based on the custom ti,hwmods property, we want to drop
both the platform data and ti,hwmods property in a single patch.

Since the dmtimer can use both 32k clock and system clock as the
source, let's also configure the SoC specific default values. The
board specific dts files can reconfigure these with assigned-clocks
and assigned-clock-parents as needed.

Let's also update the dts file to use #include while at it.
