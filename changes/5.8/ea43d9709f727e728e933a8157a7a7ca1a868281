nvme: fix identify error status silent ignore

Commit 59c7c3caaaf8 intended to only silently ignore non retry-able
errors (DNR bit set) such that we can still identify misbehaving
controllers, and in the other hand propagate retry-able errors (DNR bit
cleared) so we don't wrongly abandon a namespace just because it happens
to be temporarily inaccessible.

The goal remains the same as the original commit where this was
introduced but unfortunately had the logic backwards.
