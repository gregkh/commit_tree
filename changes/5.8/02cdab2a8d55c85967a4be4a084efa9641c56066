iio: light: cm32181: Add support for the CM3218

Add support for the CM3218 which is an older version of the
CM32181.

This is based on a newer version of cm32181.c, with a copyright of:

Which is floating around on the net in various places, but the changes
from this newer version never made it upstream.

This was tested on an Asus T100TA and an Asus T100CHI, which both come
with the CM3218 variant of the light sensor.
