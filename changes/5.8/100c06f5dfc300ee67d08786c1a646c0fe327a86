staging: wfx: drop unused variable

Since the commit 3f84adfe1d7ae ("staging: wfx: remove hack about tx_rate
policies"), the variable "count" is no more used in wfx_tx_policy_build().

Notice that there were two instances of the variable "count" in
wfx_tx_policy_build(). This patch also solves this cosmetic issue.
