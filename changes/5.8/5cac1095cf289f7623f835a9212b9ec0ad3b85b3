scsi: ufs: Make ufshcd_wait_for_register() sleep instead of busy-waiting

The ufshcd_wait_for_register() function either sleeps or spins until the
specified register has reached the desired value. Busy-waiting is not only
considered a bad practice but also has a bad impact on energy
consumption. Always sleep instead of spinning by making sure that all
ufshcd_wait_for_register() calls happen from a context where it is allowed
to sleep. The only function call that has to be moved is the
ufshcd_hba_stop() call in ufshcd_host_reset_and_restore().
