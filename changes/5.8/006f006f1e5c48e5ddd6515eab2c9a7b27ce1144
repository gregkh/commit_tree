thermal/int340x_thermal: Export OEM vendor variables

The platform vendor may expose an array of OEM-specific values to be used
in determining DPTF policy. These are obtained via the ODVP method, and
then simply exposed in sysfs. In addition, they are updated when a
notification is received or when the DPTF policy is changed by userland.
