drm/sun4i: mixer: Call of_dma_configure if there's an IOMMU

The main DRM device is actually a virtual device so it doesn't have the
iommus property, which is instead on the DMA masters, in this case the
mixers.

Add a call to of_dma_configure with the mixers DT node but on the DRM
virtual device to configure it in the same way than the mixers.
