rtlwifi: use true,false for bool variable in rtl_init_rfkill()

The 'blocked' is a bool variable, and '==' expression itself is bool
too. So no need to convert it to 0/1.

This fixes the following coccicheck warning:

drivers/net/wireless/realtek/rtlwifi/base.c:508:13-41: WARNING:
Comparison of 0/1 to bool variable
