ath10k: Avoid override CE5 configuration for QCA99X0 chipsets

As the exisiting CE configurations are defined in global, there
are the chances of QCA99X0 family chipsets CE configurations
are getting changed by the ath10k_pci_override_ce_config()
function.

The override will be hit and CE5 configurations will be changed,
when the user bring up the QCA99X0 chipsets along with QCA6174
or QCA9377 chipset. (Bring up QCA99X0 family chipsets after
QCA6174 or QCA9377).

Hence, fixing this issue by moving the global CE configuration
to radio specific CE configuration.

Tested hardware: QCA9888 & QCA6174
Tested firmware: 10.4-3.10-00047 & WLAN.RM.4.4.1.c3-00058
