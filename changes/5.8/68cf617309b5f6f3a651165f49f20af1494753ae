KVM: arm64: Fix definition of PAGE_HYP_DEVICE

PAGE_HYP_DEVICE is intended to encode attribute bits for an EL2 stage-1
pte mapping a device. Unfortunately, it includes PROT_DEVICE_nGnRE which
encodes attributes for EL1 stage-1 mappings such as UXN and nG, which are
RES0 for EL2, and DBM which is meaningless as TCR_EL2.HD is not set.

Fix the definition of PAGE_HYP_DEVICE so that it doesn't set RES0 bits
at EL2.
