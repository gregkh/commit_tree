habanalabs: increase h/w timer when checking idle

In GAUDI the current timer value for the hardware to check if it is
in IDLE state is too low. As a result, there are occasions where the H/W
wrongly reports it is not IDLE. The driver checks that before submitting
work on behalf of the driver during initialization, so a false report might
cause the driver to fail during device initialization.
