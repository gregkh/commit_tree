net: hns3: fix a TX timeout issue

When the queue depth and queue parameters are modified, there is
a low probability that TX timeout occurs. The two operations cause
the link to be down or up when the watchdog is still working. All
queues are stopped when the link is down. After the carrier is on,
all queues are woken up. If the watchdog detects the link between
the carrier on and wakeup queues, a false TX timeout occurs.

So fix this issue by modifying the sequence of carrier on and queue
wakeup, which is symmetrical to the link down action.
