KVM: nVMX: Validate the EPTP when emulating INVEPT(EXTENT_CONTEXT)

Signal VM-Fail for the single-context variant of INVEPT if the specified
EPTP is invalid.  Per the INEVPT pseudocode in Intel's SDM, it's subject
to the standard EPT checks:

  If VM entry with the "enable EPT" VM execution control set to 1 would
  fail due to the EPTP value then VMfail(Invalid operand to INVEPT/INVVPID);
