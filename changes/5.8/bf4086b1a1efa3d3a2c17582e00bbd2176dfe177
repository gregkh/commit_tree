KVM: arm64: Prevent vcpu_has_ptrauth from generating OOL functions

So far, vcpu_has_ptrauth() is implemented in terms of system_supports_*_auth()
calls, which are declared "inline". In some specific conditions (clang
and SCS), the "inline" very much turns into an "out of line", which
leads to a fireworks when this predicate is evaluated on a non-VHE
system (right at the beginning of __hyp_handle_ptrauth).

Instead, make sure vcpu_has_ptrauth gets expanded inline by directly
using the cpus_have_final_cap() helpers, which are __always_inline,
generate much better code, and are the only thing that make sense when
running at EL2 on a nVHE system.
