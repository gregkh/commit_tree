arm64: tegra: Add Tegra VI CSI support in device tree

Tegra210 contains VI controller for video input capture from MIPI
CSI camera sensors and also supports built-in test pattern generator.

CSI ports can be one-to-one mapped to VI channels for capturing from
an external sensor or from built-in test pattern generator.

This patch adds support for VI and CSI and enables them in Tegra210
device tree.
