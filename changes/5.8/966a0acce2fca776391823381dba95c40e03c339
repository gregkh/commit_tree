arm64/alternatives: move length validation inside the subsection

Commit f7b93d42945c ("arm64/alternatives: use subsections for replacement
sequences") breaks LLVM's integrated assembler, because due to its
one-pass design, it cannot compute instruction sequence lengths before the
layout for the subsection has been finalized. This change fixes the build
by moving the .org directives inside the subsection, so they are processed
after the subsection layout is known.
