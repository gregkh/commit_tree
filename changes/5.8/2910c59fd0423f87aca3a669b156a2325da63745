squashfs: fix length field overlap check in metadata reading

This is a regression introduced by the "migrate from ll_rw_block usage
to BIO" patch.

Squashfs packs structures on byte boundaries, and due to that the length
field (of the metadata block) may not be fully in the current block.
The new code rewrote and introduced a faulty check for that edge case.
