dt-bindings: clock: renesas: div6: Convert to json-schema

Convert the Renesas CPG DIV6 Clock Device Tree binding documentation to
json-schema.

Drop R-Car Gen2 compatible values, which were obsoleted by the unified
"Renesas Clock Pulse Generator / Module Standby and Software Reset" DT
bindings.
Update the example to match reality.
