ALSA: usb-audio: Add duplex sound support for USB devices using implicit feedback

For USB sound devices using implicit feedback the endpoint used for
this feedback should be able to be opened twice, once for required
feedback and second time for audio data. This way these devices can be
put in duplex audio mode. Since this only works if the settings of the
endpoint don't change a check is included for this.

This fixes bug 207023 ("MOTU M2 regression on duplex audio") and
should also fix bug 103751 ("M-Audio Fast Track Ultra usb audio device
will not operate full-duplex")
