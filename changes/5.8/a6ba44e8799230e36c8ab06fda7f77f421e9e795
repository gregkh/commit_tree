powerpc/watchpoint: Introduce function to get nr watchpoints dynamically

So far we had only one watchpoint, so we have hardcoded HBP_NUM to 1.
But Power10 is introducing 2nd DAWR and thus kernel should be able to
dynamically find actual number of watchpoints supported by hw it's
running on. Introduce function for the same. Also convert HBP_NUM macro
to HBP_NUM_MAX, which will now represent maximum number of watchpoints
supported by Powerpc.
