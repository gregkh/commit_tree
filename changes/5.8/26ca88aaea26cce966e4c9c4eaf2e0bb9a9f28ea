i2c: tegra: Keep IRQs enabled during suspend/resume

One of the I2C controllers on Tegra SoCs is typically connected to a
system PMIC, which provides controls for critical power supplies for
most platforms.

Some drivers, such as PCI, need to disable these regulators during a
very late stage during suspend and resume them at a very early stage
during resume.

To support these use-cases, keep interrupts disabled during suspend/
resume.
