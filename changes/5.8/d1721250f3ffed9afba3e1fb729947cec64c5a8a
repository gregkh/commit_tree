x86/entry: Move SYSENTER's regs->sp and regs->flags fixups into C

The SYSENTER asm (32-bit and compat) contains fixups for regs->sp and
regs->flags.  Move the fixups into C and fix some comments while at it.

This is a valid cleanup all by itself, and it also simplifies the
subsequent patch that will fix Xen PV SYSENTER.
