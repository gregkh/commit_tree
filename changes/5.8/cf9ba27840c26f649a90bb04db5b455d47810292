drm/i915/selftests: Disable C-states when measuring RPS frequency response

Let's isolate the impact of cpu frequency selection on determing the GPU
throughput in response to selection of RPS frequencies.

For real systems, we do have to be concerned with the impact of
integrating c-states, p-states and rp-states, but for the sake of
proving whether or not RPS works, one baby step at a time.

For the record, as one would hope, it does not seem to impact on the
measured performance, but we do it anyway to reduce the number of
variables. Later, we can extend the testing to encourage the the
cpu/pkg to try and sleep while the GPU is busy.
