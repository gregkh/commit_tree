mm: add comments on pglist_data zones

While making other modifications it was easy to confuse the two struct
members node_zones and node_zonelists.  For those already familiar with
the code, this might seem to be a silly patch, but it's quite helpful to
disambiguate the similar-sounding fields

While here, add a small comment on why nr_zones isn't simply MAX_NR_ZONES
