net: flow_offload: simplify hw stats check handling

Make FLOW_ACTION_HW_STATS_DONT_CARE be all bits, rather than none, so that
 drivers and __flow_action_hw_stats_check can use simple bitwise checks.

Pre-fill all actions with DONT_CARE in flow_rule_alloc(), rather than
 relying on implicit semantics of zero from kzalloc, so that callers which
 don't configure action stats themselves (i.e. netfilter) get the correct
 behaviour by default.

Only the kernel's internal API semantics change; the TC uAPI is unaffected.

v4: move DONT_CARE setting to flow_rule_alloc() for robustness and simplicity.

v3: set DONT_CARE in nft and ct offload.

v2: rebased on net-next, removed RFC tags.
