staging: wfx: repair external IRQ for SDIO

When used over SDIO bus, device is able to use an external line to
signal IRQs (also called Out-Of-Band IRQ). The current code have several
problems:
  1. The ISR cannot directly acknowledge IRQ since access to the bus is
     not atomic. This patch use a threaded IRQ to solve that issue.
  2. On certain platforms, it is necessary to keep SDIO interruption
     enabled (with register SDIO_CCCR_IENx) (this part has inspired from
     the brcmfmac driver).
