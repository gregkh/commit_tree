net/mlx5: Fix a bug of using ptp channel index as pin index

On PTP mlx5_ptp_enable(on=0) flow, driver mistakenly used channel index
as pin index.

After ptp patch marked in fixes tag was introduced, driver can freely
call ptp_find_pin() as part of the .enable() callback.

Fix driver mlx5_ptp_enable(on=0) flow to always use ptp_find_pin(). With
that, Driver will use the correct pin index in mlx5_ptp_enable(on=0) flow.

In addition, when initializing the pins, always set channel to zero. As
all pins can be attached to all channels, let ptp_set_pinfunc() to move
them between the channels.

For stable branches, this fix to be applied only on kernels that includes
both patches in fixes tag. Otherwise, mlx5_ptp_enable(on=0) will be stuck
on pincfg_mux.
