spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Fix lockup if device is removed during SPI transfer

During device removal, the driver should unregister the SPI controller
and stop the hardware.  Otherwise the dspi_transfer_one_message() could
wait on completion infinitely.

Additionally, calling spi_unregister_controller() first in device
removal reverse-matches the probe function, where SPI controller is
registered at the end.
