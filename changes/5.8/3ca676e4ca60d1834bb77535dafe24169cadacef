kgdb: Prevent infinite recursive entries to the debugger

If we detect that we recursively entered the debugger we should hack
our I/O ops to NULL so that the panic() in the next line won't
actually cause another recursion into the debugger.  The first line of
kgdb_panic() will check this and return.
