ARM: 8980/1: Allow either FLATMEM or SPARSEMEM on the multiplatform build

ARMv7 chips with LPAE can often benefit from SPARSEMEM, as portions of
system memory can be located deep in the 36-bit address space.  Allow
FLATMEM or SPARSEMEM to be selectable at compile time; FLATMEM remains
the default.

This is based on Kevin's "[PATCH 3/3] ARM: Allow either FLATMEM or
SPARSEMEM on the multi-v7 build" from [1] and shamelessly rips off his
commit message text above.  As Arnd pointed out at [2] there doesn't
seem to be any reason to tie this specifically to ARMv7, so this has
been changed to apply to all multiplatform kernels.

The addition of this option does not change the defaults and a build with
any defconfig will behave the same way as previously.

The only effect this change has is to enable user to change "Memory model"
selection in interactive kernel configuration (menuconfig, xconfig etc).
