locktorture.c: Fix if-statement empty body warnings

When using -Wextra, gcc complains about torture_preempt_schedule()
when its definition is empty (i.e., when CONFIG_PREEMPTION is not
set/enabled).  Fix these warnings by adding an empty do-while block
for that macro when CONFIG_PREEMPTION is not set.
Fixes these build warnings:

../kernel/locking/locktorture.c:119:29: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
../kernel/locking/locktorture.c:166:29: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
../kernel/locking/locktorture.c:337:29: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
../kernel/locking/locktorture.c:490:29: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
../kernel/locking/locktorture.c:528:29: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]
../kernel/locking/locktorture.c:553:29: warning: suggest braces around empty body in an ‘if’ statement [-Wempty-body]

I have verified that there is no object code change (with gcc 7.5.0).
