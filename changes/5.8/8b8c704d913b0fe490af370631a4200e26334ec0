ima: Remove __init annotation from ima_pcrread()

Commit 6cc7c266e5b4 ("ima: Call ima_calc_boot_aggregate() in
ima_eventdigest_init()") added a call to ima_calc_boot_aggregate() so that
the digest can be recalculated for the boot_aggregate measurement entry if
the 'd' template field has been requested. For the 'd' field, only SHA1 and
MD5 digests are accepted.

Given that ima_eventdigest_init() does not have the __init annotation, all
functions called should not have it. This patch removes __init from
ima_pcrread().
