crypto: ccp - Add support for SEV-ES to the PSP driver

To provide support for SEV-ES, the hypervisor must provide an area of
memory to the PSP. Once this Trusted Memory Region (TMR) is provided to
the PSP, the contents of this area of memory are no longer available to
the x86.

Update the PSP driver to allocate a 1MB region for the TMR that is 1MB
aligned and then provide it to the PSP through the SEV INIT command.
