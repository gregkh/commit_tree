powerpc/entry32: Blacklist exception entry points for kprobe.

kprobe does not handle events happening in real mode.

As exception entry points are running with MMU disabled,
blacklist them.

The handling of TLF_NAPPING and TLF_SLEEPING is moved before the
CONFIG_TRACE_IRQFLAGS which contains 'reenable_mmu' because from there
kprobe will be possible as the kernel will run with MMU enabled.
