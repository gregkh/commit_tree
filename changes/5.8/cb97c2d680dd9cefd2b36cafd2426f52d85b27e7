KVM: x86: Take an unsigned 32-bit int for has_emulated_msr()'s index

Take a u32 for the index in has_emulated_msr() to match hardware, which
treats MSR indices as unsigned 32-bit values.  Functionally, taking a
signed int doesn't cause problems with the current code base, but could
theoretically cause problems with 32-bit KVM, e.g. if the index were
checked via a less-than statement, which would evaluate incorrectly for
MSR indices with bit 31 set.
