ASoC: soc-dai: add snd_soc_dai_active()

Current snd_soc_dai_action() is updating
dai->stream_active for Playback/Capture (A),
dai->active        for DAI (B)

        void snd_soc_dai_action(struct snd_soc_dai *dai,
                                int stream, int action)
        {
(A)             dai->stream_active[stream]      += action;
(B)             dai->active                     += action;
                dai->component->active          += action;
        }

But, these are very verbose, because we can calculate
DAI active from stream_active.

This patch adds snd_soc_dai_active() which calculate
DAI active from DAI stream_active.
