libbpf: Fix memory leak and possible double-free in hashmap__clear

Fix memory leak in hashmap_clear() not freeing hashmap_entry structs for each
of the remaining entries. Also NULL-out bucket list to prevent possible
double-free between hashmap__clear() and hashmap__free().

Running test_progs-asan flavor clearly showed this problem.
