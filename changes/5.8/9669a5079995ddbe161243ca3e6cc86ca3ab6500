drm/i915: Drop rq->ring->vma peeking from error capture

We only hold the active spinlock while dumping the error state, and this
does not prevent another thread from retiring the request -- as it is
quite possible that despite us capturing the current state, the GPU has
completed the request. As such, it is dangerous to dereference state
below the request as it may already be freed, and the simplest way to
avoid the danger is not include it in the error state.
