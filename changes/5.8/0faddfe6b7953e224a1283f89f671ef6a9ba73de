net/mlx5e: E-Switch, Add misc bit when misc fields changed for mirroring

The modified flow_context fields in FTE must be indicated in
modify_enable bitmask. Previously, the misc bit in modify_enable is
always set as source vport must be set for each rule. So, when parsing
vxlan/gre/geneve/qinq rules, this bit is not set because those are all
from the same misc fileds that source vport fields are located at, and
we don't need to set the indicator twice.

After adding per vport tables for mirroring, misc bit is not set, then
firmware syndrome happens. To fix it, set the bit wherever misc fileds
are changed. This also makes it unnecessary to check misc fields and set
the misc bit accordingly in metadata matching, so here remove it.

Besides, flow_source must be specified for uplink because firmware
will check it and some actions are only allowed for packets received
from uplink.
