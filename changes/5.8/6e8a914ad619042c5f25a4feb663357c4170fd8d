ALSA: line6: Perform sanity check for each URB creation

LINE6 drivers create stream URBs with a fixed pipe without checking
its validity, and this may lead to a kernel WARNING at the submission
when a malformed USB descriptor is passed.

For avoiding the kernel warning, perform the similar sanity checks for
each pipe type at creating a URB.
