xsk: Explicitly inline functions and move definitions

In order to reduce the number of function calls, the struct
xsk_buff_pool definition is moved to xsk_buff_pool.h. The functions
xp_get_dma(), xp_dma_sync_for_cpu(), xp_dma_sync_for_device(),
xp_validate_desc() and various helper functions are explicitly
inlined.

Further, move xp_get_handle() and xp_release() to xsk.c, to allow for
the compiler to perform inlining.

rfc->v1: Make sure xp_validate_desc() is inlined for Tx perf. (Maxim)
