drm/i915: Immediately execute the fenced work

If the caller allows and we do not have to wait for any signals,
immediately execute the work within the caller's process. By doing so we
avoid the overhead of scheduling a new task, and the latency in
executing it, at the cost of pulling that work back into the immediate
context. (Sometimes we still prefer to offload the task to another cpu,
especially if we plan on executing many such tasks in parallel for this
client.)
