thermal: devfreq_cooling: Use PM QoS to set frequency limits

Now that devfreq supports limiting the frequency range of a device
through PM QoS make use of it instead of disabling OPPs that should
not be used.

The switch from disabling OPPs to PM QoS introduces a subtle behavioral
change in case of conflicting requests (min > max): PM QoS gives
precedence to the MIN_FREQUENCY request, while higher OPPs disabled
with dev_pm_opp_disable() would override MIN_FREQUENCY.
