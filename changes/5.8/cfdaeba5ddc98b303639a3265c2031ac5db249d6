net: hns3: fix desc filling bug when skb is expanded or lineared

The linear and frag data part may be changed when the skb is expanded
or lineared in skb_cow_head() or skb_checksum_help(), which is called
by hns3_fill_skb_desc(), so the linear len return by skb_headlen()
before the calling of hns3_fill_skb_desc() is unreliable.

Move hns3_fill_skb_desc() before the calling of skb_headlen() to fix
this bug.
