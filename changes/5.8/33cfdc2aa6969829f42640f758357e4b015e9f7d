nvme: enforce extended LBA format for fabrics metadata

An extended LBA is a larger LBA that is created when metadata associated
with the LBA is transferred contiguously with the LBA data (AKA
interleaved). The metadata may be either transferred as part of the LBA
(creating an extended LBA) or it may be transferred as a separate
contiguous buffer of data. According to the NVMeoF spec, a fabrics ctrl
supports only an Extended LBA format. Fail revalidation in case we have a
spec violation. Also add a flag that will imply on capable transports and
controllers as part of a preparation for allowing end-to-end protection
information for fabric controllers.
