Revert "ARM: vexpress: Don't select VEXPRESS_CONFIG"

This reverts commit 848685c25da99d871bbd87369f3c3d6eead661ac.
Due to when I set 'depends on VEXPRESS_CONFOG=Y' in 'config
POWER_RESET_VEXPRESS' to get an allmodconfig build on arm64 to build,
and allmodconfig build on arm fails if this patch isn't reverted.
