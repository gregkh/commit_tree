net/smc: multiple link support for rmb buffer registration

The CONFIRM_RKEY LLC processing handles all links in one LLC message.
Move the call to this processing out of smcr_link_reg_rmb() which does
processing per link, into smcr_lgr_reg_rmbs() which is responsible for
link group level processing. Move smcr_link_reg_rmb() into module
smc_core.c.
>From af_smc.c now call smcr_lgr_reg_rmbs() to register new rmbs on all
available links.
