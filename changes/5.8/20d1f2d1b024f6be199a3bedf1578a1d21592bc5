net: bcmgenet: use hardware padding of runt frames

When commit 474ea9cafc45 ("net: bcmgenet: correctly pad short
packets") added the call to skb_padto() it should have been
located before the nr_frags parameter was read since that value
could be changed when padding packets with lengths between 55
and 59 bytes (inclusive).

The use of a stale nr_frags value can cause corruption of the
pad data when tx-scatter-gather is enabled. This corruption of
the pad can cause invalid checksum computation when hardware
offload of tx-checksum is also enabled.

Since the original reason for the padding was corrected by
commit 7dd399130efb ("net: bcmgenet: fix skb_len in
bcmgenet_xmit_single()") we can remove the software padding all
together and make use of hardware padding of short frames as
long as the hardware also always appends the FCS value to the
frame.
