hexagon: suppress error message for 'make clean'

'make ARCH=hexagon clean' emits an error message as follows:

  $ make ARCH=hexagon clean
  gcc: error: unrecognized command line option '-G0'

You can suppress it by setting the correct CROSS_COMPILE=,
but we should not require any compiler for cleaning.
