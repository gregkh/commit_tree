net/sched: act_ct: fix restore the qdisc_skb_cb after defrag

The fragment packets do defrag in tcf_ct_handle_fragments
will clear the skb->cb which make the qdisc_skb_cb clear
too. So the qdsic_skb_cb should be store before defrag and
restore after that.
It also update the pkt_len after all the
fragments finish the defrag to one packet and make the
following actions counter correct.
