habanalabs: add hwmgr module for gaudi

The hwmgr module is responsible for messages sent to GAUDI F/W that are
not common to all habanalabs ASICs.

In GAUDI, we provide the user a simplified mode of controlling the ASIC
clock frequency. Instead of three different clocks, we present a single
clock property that the user can configure via sysfs.
