libbpf: Add API to consume the perf ring buffer content

This new API, perf_buffer__consume, can be used as follows:

- When you have a perf ring where wakeup_events is higher than 1,
  and you have remaining data in the rings you would like to pull
  out on exit (or maybe based on a timeout).

- For low latency cases where you burn a CPU that constantly polls
  the queues.
