lib/flex_proportions.c: cleanup __fprop_inc_percpu_max

If the given type has fraction smaller than max_frac/FPROP_FRAC_BASE, the
code could be modified to call __fprop_inc_percpu() directly and easier to
understand.  After this patch, fprop_reflect_period_percpu() will be
called twice, and quicky return on pl->period == p->period test, so it
would not result to significant downside of performance.

Thanks for Jan's guidance.
