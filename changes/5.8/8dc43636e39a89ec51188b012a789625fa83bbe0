crypto: omap-sham - force kernel driver usage for sha algos

As the hardware acceleration for the omap-sham algos is not available
from userspace, force kernel driver usage. Without this flag in place,
openssl 1.1 implementation thinks it can accelerate sha algorithms on
omap devices directly from userspace.
