mm/hugetlb: avoid hardcoding while checking if cma is enabled

hugetlb_cma[0] can be NULL due to various reasons, for example, node0
has no memory.  so NULL hugetlb_cma[0] doesn't necessarily mean cma is
not enabled.  gigantic pages might have been reserved on other nodes.
This patch fixes possible double reservation and CMA leak.
