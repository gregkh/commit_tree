bpf: Support GET_FD_BY_ID and GET_NEXT_ID for bpf_link

Add support to look up bpf_link by ID and iterate over all existing bpf_links
in the system. GET_FD_BY_ID code handles not-yet-ready bpf_link by checking
that its ID hasn't been set to non-zero value yet. Setting bpf_link's ID is
done as the very last step in finalizing bpf_link, together with installing
FD. This approach allows users of bpf_link in kernel code to not worry about
races between user-space and kernel code that hasn't finished attaching and
initializing bpf_link.
