powerpc: Use set_trap() and avoid open-coding trap masking

The pt_regs.trap field keeps 4 low bits for some metadata about the
trap or how it was handled, which is masked off in order to test the
architectural trap number.

Add a set_trap() accessor to set this, equivalent to TRAP() for
returning it. This is actually not quite the equivalent of TRAP()
because it always clears the low bits, which may be harmless if
it can only be updated via ptrace syscall, but it seems dangerous.

In fact settting TRAP from ptrace doesn't seem like a great idea
so maybe it's better deleted.
