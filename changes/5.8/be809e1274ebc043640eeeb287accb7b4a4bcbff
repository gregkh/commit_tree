ext4: clean up ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() error handling

If ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() fails when called within
ext4_ext_handle_unwritten_extents(), immediately error out through the
exit point at function end.  Fix the error handling in the event
ext4_ext_convert_to_initialized() returns 0, which it shouldn't do when
converting an existing extent.  The current code returns the passed in
value of allocated (which is likely non-zero) while failing to set
m_flags, m_pblk, and m_len.
