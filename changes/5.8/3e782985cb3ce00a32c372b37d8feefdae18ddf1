net: ethernet: fec: Allow configuration of MDIO bus speed

MDIO busses typically operate at 2.5MHz. However many devices can
operate at faster speeds. This then allows more MDIO transactions per
second, useful for Ethernet switch statistics, or Ethernet PHY TDR
data. Allow the bus speed to be configured, using the standard
"clock-frequency" property, which i2c busses use to indicate the bus
speed. Before using this property, ensure all devices on the bus do
actually support the requested clock speed.
