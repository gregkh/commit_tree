staging: tegra-video: fix V4L2 dependency

Rather than using a dependency on VIDEO_V4L2, this driver uses
"select", which fails when other dependencies are missing:

WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for VIDEO_V4L2
  Depends on [n]: MEDIA_SUPPORT [=y] && (I2C [=y] || I2C [=y]=n) && VIDEO_DEV [=n]
  Selected by [y]:
  - VIDEO_TEGRA [=y] && STAGING [=y] && STAGING_MEDIA [=y] && MEDIA_SUPPORT [=y] && TEGRA_HOST1X [=y]
(plus an endless stream of link errors for other drivers that
depend on VIDEO_V4L2 but are now lacking their dependencies)
