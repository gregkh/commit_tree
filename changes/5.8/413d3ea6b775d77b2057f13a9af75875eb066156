arm64: traps: Dump registers prior to panic() in bad_mode()

When panicing due to an unknown/unhandled exception at EL1, dump the
registers of the faulting context so that it's easier to figure out
what went wrong. In particular, this makes it a lot easier to debug
in-kernel BTI failures since it pretty-prints PSTATE.BTYPE in the crash
log.
