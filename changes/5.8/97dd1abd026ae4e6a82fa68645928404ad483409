net: qed: fix left elements count calculation

qed_chain_get_element_left{,_u32} returned 0 when the difference
between producer and consumer page count was equal to the total
page count.
Fix this by conditional expanding of producer value (vs
unconditional). This allowed to eliminate normalizaton against
total page count, which was the cause of this bug.

Misc: replace open-coded constants with common defines.
