powerpc/module_64: Simplify check for -mprofile-kernel ftrace relocations

For -mprofile-kernel, we need special handling when generating stubs for
ftrace calls such as _mcount(). To faciliate this, we check if a
R_PPC64_REL24 relocation is for a symbol named "_mcount()" along with
also checking the instruction sequence. The latter is not really
required since "_mcount()" is an exported symbol and kernel modules
cannot use it. As such, drop the additional checking and simplify the
code. This helps unify stub creation for ftrace stubs with
-mprofile-kernel and aids in code reuse.

Also rename is_mprofile_mcount_callsite() to is_mprofile_ftrace_call()
to reflect the checking being done.
