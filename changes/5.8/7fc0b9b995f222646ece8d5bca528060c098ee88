EDAC: Drop the EDAC report status checks

When acpi_extlog was added, we were worried that the same error would
be reported more than once by different subsystems. But in the ensuing
years I've seen complaints that people could not find an error log
(because this mechanism suppressed the log they were looking for).

Rip it all out. People are smart enough to notice the same address from
different reporting mechanisms.
