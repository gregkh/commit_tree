khugepaged: allow to collapse a page shared across fork

The page can be included into collapse as long as it doesn't have extra
pins (from GUP or otherwise).

Logic to check the refcount is moved to a separate function.  For pages in
swap cache, add compound_nr(page) to the expected refcount, in order to
handle the compound page case.  This is in preparation for the following
patch.

VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() was removed from __collapse_huge_page_copy() as the
invariant it checks is no longer valid: the source can be mapped multiple
times now.
