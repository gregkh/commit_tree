xdp: Xdp_frame add member frame_sz and handle in convert_to_xdp_frame

Use hole in struct xdp_frame, when adding member frame_sz, which keeps
same sizeof struct (32 bytes)

Drivers ixgbe and sfc had bug cases where the necessary/expected
tailroom was not reserved. This can lead to some hard to catch memory
corruption issues. Having the drivers frame_sz this can be detected when
packet length/end via xdp->data_end exceed the xdp_data_hard_end
pointer, which accounts for the reserved the tailroom.

When detecting this driver issue, simply fail the conversion with NULL,
which results in feedback to driver (failing xdp_do_redirect()) causing
driver to drop packet. Given the lack of consistent XDP stats, this can
be hard to troubleshoot. And given this is a driver bug, we want to
generate some more noise in form of a WARN stack dump (to ID the driver
code that inlined convert_to_xdp_frame).

Inlining the WARN macro is problematic, because it adds an asm
instruction (on Intel CPUs ud2) what influence instruction cache
prefetching. Thus, introduce xdp_warn and macro XDP_WARN, to avoid this
and at the same time make identifying the function and line of this
inlined function easier.
