firmware: Fix a reference count leak.

kobject_init_and_add() takes reference even when it fails.
If this function returns an error, kobject_put() must be called to
properly clean up the memory associated with the object.
Callback function fw_cfg_sysfs_release_entry() in kobject_put()
can handle the pointer "entry" properly.
