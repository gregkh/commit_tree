dma-direct: atomic allocations must come from atomic coherent pools

When a device requires unencrypted memory and the context does not allow
blocking, memory must be returned from the atomic coherent pools.

This avoids the remap when CONFIG_DMA_DIRECT_REMAP is not enabled and the
config only requires CONFIG_DMA_COHERENT_POOL.  This will be used for
CONFIG_AMD_MEM_ENCRYPT in a subsequent patch.

Keep all memory in these pools unencrypted.  When set_memory_decrypted()
fails, this prohibits the memory from being added.  If adding memory to
the genpool fails, and set_memory_encrypted() subsequently fails, there
is no alternative other than leaking the memory.
