ARM: dts: keystone-k2g-evm: fix rgmii phy-mode for ksz9031 phy

Since commit bcf3440c6dd7 ("net: phy: micrel: add phy-mode support for the
KSZ9031 PHY") the networking is broken on keystone-k2g-evm board.

The above board have phy-mode = "rgmii-id" and it is worked before because
KSZ9031 PHY started with default RGMII internal delays configuration (TX
off, RX on 1.2 ns) and MAC provided TX delay by default.
After above commit, the KSZ9031 PHY starts handling phy mode properly and
enables both RX and TX delays, as result networking is become broken.

Fix it by switching to phy-mode = "rgmii-rxid" to reflect previous
behavior.
