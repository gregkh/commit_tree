staging: wfx: remove unnecessary conditions in wfx_bss_info_changed()

wfx_bss_info_changed() update ERP and CQM related stuff. Thus, it check
the flags BSS_CHANGED_ERP_* and BSS_CHANGED_CQM.

It also update ERP and CQM on join and leave by checking the flag
BSS_CHANGED_ASSOC. This check is useless. Mac80211 already do that job
and set necessary flags as expected.
