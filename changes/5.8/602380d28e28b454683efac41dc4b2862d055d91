blk-mq: add blk_mq_all_tag_iter

Add a new blk_mq_all_tag_iter function to iterate over all allocated
scheduler tags and driver tags.  This is more flexible than the existing
blk_mq_all_tag_busy_iter function as it allows the callers to do whatever
they want on allocated request instead of being limited to started
requests.

It will be used to implement draining allocated requests on specified
hctx in this patchset.

[hch: switch from the two booleans to a more readable flags field and
 consolidate the tags iter functions]
