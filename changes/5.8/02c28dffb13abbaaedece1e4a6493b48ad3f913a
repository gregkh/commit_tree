rxrpc: Fix afs large storage transmission performance drop

Commit 2ad6691d988c, which moved the modification of the status annotation
for a packet in the Tx buffer prior to the retransmission moved the state
clearance, but managed to lose the bit that set it to UNACK.

Consequently, if a retransmission occurs, the packet is accidentally
changed to the ACK state (ie. 0) by masking it off, which means that the
packet isn't counted towards the tally of newly-ACK'd packets if it gets
hard-ACK'd.  This then prevents the congestion control algorithm from
recovering properly.

Fix by reinstating the change of state to UNACK.

Spotted by the generic/460 xfstest.
