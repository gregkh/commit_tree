drm/i915/execlists: Check preempt-timeout target before submit_ports

We evaluate *active, which is a pointer into execlists->inflight[]
during dequeue to decide how long a preempt-timeout we need to apply.
However, as soon as we do the submit_ports, the HW may send its ACK
interrupt causing us to promote execlists->pending[] tp
execlists->inflight[], overwriting the value of *active. We know *active
is only stable until we submit (as we only submit when there is no
pending promotion).
