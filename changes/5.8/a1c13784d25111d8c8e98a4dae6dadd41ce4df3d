dt-bindings: bus: Add Baikal-T1 APB-bus binding

Baikal-T1 CPU or DMAC MMIO requests are handled by the AMBA 3 AXI
Interconnect which routes them to the AXI-APB bridge, which in turn
serializes accesses and routes them to the corresponding APB slave device.
This binding describes the AXI-APB bridge considered as the APB-bus. It is
supposed to be compatible with "be,bt1-apb" and "simple-bus" drivers,
should be equipped with EHB MMIO region and a region with no slave device
mapped, interrupts line number, APB reference clock and domain reset line.
