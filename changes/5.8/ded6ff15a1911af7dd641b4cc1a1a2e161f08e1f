ath9k: invalidate all calibrations at once

Previously after the calibration validity period is over,
calibrations are invalidated in a one at time manner. So, for AR9002
family, which has three calibrations, the full recalibration interval
becomes 3 x ATH_RESTART_CALINTERVAL. And each next calibration will be
separated by the ATH_RESTART_CALINTERVAL time from a previous one.

It seems like it is better to do whole recalibration at once. Also, this
change makes the driver behaviour a little simpler. So, invalidate all
calibrations at once at the end of the calibration validity interval.

This change affects only AR9002 chips family, since the AR9003 utilize
only a single calibration.
