bnxt_en: Fix AER reset logic on 57500 chips.

AER reset should follow the same steps as suspend/resume.  We need to
free context memory during AER reset and allocate new context memory
during recovery by calling bnxt_hwrm_func_qcaps().  We also need
to call bnxt_reenable_sriov() to restore the VFs.
