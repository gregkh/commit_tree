bpf: Allow loading of a bpf_iter program

A bpf_iter program is a tracing program with attach type
BPF_TRACE_ITER. The load attribute
  attach_btf_id
is used by the verifier against a particular kernel function,
which represents a target, e.g., __bpf_iter__bpf_map
for target bpf_map which is implemented later.

The program return value must be 0 or 1 for now.
  0 : successful, except potential seq_file buffer overflow
      which is handled by seq_file reader.
  1 : request to restart the same object

In the future, other return values may be used for filtering or
teminating the iterator.
