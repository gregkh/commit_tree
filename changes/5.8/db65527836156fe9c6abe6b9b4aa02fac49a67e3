remoteproc: Use a local copy for the name field

The current name field used in the remoteproc structure is simply
a pointer to a name field supplied during the rproc_alloc() call.
The pointer passed in by remoteproc drivers during registration is
typically a dev_name pointer, but it is possible that the pointer
will no longer remain valid if the devices themselves were created
at runtime like in the case of of_platform_populate(), and were
deleted upon any failures within the respective remoteproc driver
probe function.

So, allocate and maintain a local copy for this name field to
keep it agnostic of the logic used in the remoteproc drivers.
