net/9p: validate fds in p9_fd_open

p9_fd_open just fgets file descriptors passed in from userspace, but
doesn't verify that they are valid for read or writing.  This gets
cought down in the VFS when actually attempting a read or write, but
a new warning added in linux-next upsets syzcaller.

Fix this by just verifying the fds early on.
