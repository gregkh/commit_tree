Subject: [PATCH v2] ASoC: soc-pcm: fix BE dai not hw_free and shutdown during mixer update

FE state is SND_SOC_DPCM_STATE_PREPARE now, BE1 is
used by FE.

Later when new BE2 is added to FE by mixer update,
it will call dpcm_run_update_startup() to update
BE2's state, but unfortunately BE2 .prepare() meets
error, it will disconnect all non started BE.

This make BE1 dai skip .hw_free() and .shutdown(),
and the BE1 users will never decrease to zero.
