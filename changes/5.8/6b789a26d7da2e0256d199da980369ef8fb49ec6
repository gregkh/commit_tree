powerpc/ptdump: Handle hugepd at PGD level

The 8xx is about to map kernel linear space and IMMR using huge
pages.

In order to display those pages properly, ptdump needs to handle
hugepd tables at PGD level.

For the time being do it only at PGD level. Further patches may
add handling of hugepd tables at lower level for other platforms
when needed in the future.
