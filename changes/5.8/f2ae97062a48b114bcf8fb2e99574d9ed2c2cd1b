firmware: smccc: Refactor SMCCC specific bits into separate file

In order to add newer SMCCC v1.1+ functionality and to avoid cluttering
PSCI firmware driver with SMCCC bits, let us move the SMCCC specific
details under drivers/firmware/smccc/smccc.c

We can also drop conduit and smccc_version from psci_operations structure
as SMCCC was the sole user and now it maintains those.

No functionality change in this patch though.
