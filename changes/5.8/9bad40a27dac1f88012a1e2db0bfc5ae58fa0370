drm/i915/selftests: Always flush before unpining after writing

Be consistent, and even when we know we had used a WC, flush the mapped
object after writing into it. The flush understands the mapping type and
will only clflush if !I915_MAP_WC, but will always insert a wmb [sfence]
so that we can be sure that all writes are visible.

v2: Add the unconditional wmb so we are know that we always flush the
writes to memory/HW at that point.
