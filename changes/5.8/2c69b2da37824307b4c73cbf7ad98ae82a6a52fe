staging: wfx: split out wfx_filter_beacon()

Currently, wfx_update_filtering() is sometime called only to apply the
value of wvif->filter_beacon to the hardware. It is nicer to have a
specific function for beacon filtering.

In add, an attentive reader would note that wfx_update_filtering() is
always called after change of wvif->filter_beacon. Thus, it not
necessary to store filter_beacon in the struct wfx_vif. We can just pass
it as parameter.
