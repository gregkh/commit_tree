phy: sun4i-usb: fix dereference of pointer phy0 before it is null checked

Currently pointer phy0 is being dereferenced via the assignment of
phy on the call to phy_get_drvdata before phy0 is null checked, this
can lead to a null pointer dereference. Fix this by performing the
null check on phy0 before the call to phy_get_drvdata. Also replace
the phy0 == NULL check with the more usual !phy0 idiom.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference before null check")
Fixes: e6f32efb1b12 ("phy: sun4i-usb: Make sure to disable PHY0 passby for peripheral mode")
