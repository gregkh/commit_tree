KVM: arm64: Move __load_guest_stage2 to kvm_mmu.h

Having __load_guest_stage2 in kvm_hyp.h is quickly going to trigger
a circular include problem. In order to avoid this, let's move
it to kvm_mmu.h, where it will be a better fit anyway.

In the process, drop the __hyp_text annotation, which doesn't help
as the function is marked as __always_inline.
