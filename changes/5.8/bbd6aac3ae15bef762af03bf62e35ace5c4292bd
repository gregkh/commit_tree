ALSA: fireface: fix configuration error for nominal sampling transfer frequency

128000 and 192000 are congruence modulo 32000, thus it's wrong to
distinguish them as multiple of 32000 and 48000 by modulo 32000 at
first.

Additionally, used condition statement to detect quadruple speed can
cause missing bit flag.

Furthermore, counter to ensure the configuration is wrong and it
causes false positive.

This commit fixes the above three bugs.
