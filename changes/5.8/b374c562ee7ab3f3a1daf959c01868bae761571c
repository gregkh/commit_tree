serial: tegra: fix CREAD handling for PIO

Commit 33ae787b74fc ("serial: tegra: add support to ignore read") added
support for dropping input in case CREAD isn't set, but for PIO the
ignore_status_mask wasn't checked until after the character had been
put in the receive buffer.

Note that the NULL tty-port test is bogus and will be removed by a
follow-on patch.
