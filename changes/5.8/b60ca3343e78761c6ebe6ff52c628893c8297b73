ext4: don't ignore return values from ext4_ext_dirty()

Don't ignore return values from ext4_ext_dirty, since the errors
indicate valid failures below Ext4.  In all of the other instances of
ext4_ext_dirty calls, the error return value is handled in some
way. This patch makes those remaining couple of places to handle
ext4_ext_dirty errors as well. In case of ext4_split_extent_at(), the
ignorance of return value is intentional. The reason is that we are
already in error path and there isn't much we can do if ext4_ext_dirty
returns error. This patch adds a comment for that case explaining why
we ignore the return value.

In the longer run, we probably should
make sure that errors from other mark_dirty routines are handled as
well.

Ran gce-xfstests smoke tests and verified that there were no
regressions.
