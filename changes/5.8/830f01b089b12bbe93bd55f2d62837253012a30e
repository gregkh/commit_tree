KVM: SVM: Fix disable pause loop exit/pause filtering capability on SVM

'Commit 8566ac8b8e7c ("KVM: SVM: Implement pause loop exit logic in SVM")'
drops disable pause loop exit/pause filtering capability completely, I
guess it is a merge fault by Radim since disable vmexits capabilities and
pause loop exit for SVM patchsets are merged at the same time. This patch
reintroduces the disable pause loop exit/pause filtering capability support.
