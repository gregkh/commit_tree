x86/vdso/vdso2c: Convert iterators to unsigned

`i` and `j` are used everywhere with unsigned types.

Convert `i` to unsigned long in order to avoid signed to unsigned
comparisons.  Convert `k` to unsigned int with the same purpose.
Also, drop `j` as `i` could be used in place of it.
Introduce syms_nr for readability.
