remoteproc: remove rproc_elf32_sanity_check

Since checks are present in the remoteproc elf loader before calling
da_to_va, loading a elf64 will work on 32bits flavors of kernel.
Indeed, if a segment size is larger than what size_t can hold, the
loader will return an error so the functionality is equivalent to
what exists today.
