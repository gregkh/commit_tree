Kconfig: add config option for asm goto w/ outputs

This allows C code to make use of compilers with support for output
variables along the fallthrough path via preprocessor define:

  CONFIG_CC_HAS_ASM_GOTO_OUTPUT

[ This is not used anywhere yet, and currently released compilers don't
  support this yet, but it's coming, and I have some local experimental
  patches to take advantage of it when it does   - Linus ]
