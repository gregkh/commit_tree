selftests: introduce gen_tar Makefile target

The gen_kselftest_tar.sh always packages *all* selftests and doesn't
pass along any variables to `make install` to influence what should be
built. This can result in an early error on the command line ("Unknown
tarball format TARGETS=XXX"), or unexpected test failures as the
tarball contains tests people wanted to skip on purpose.

Since the makefile already contains all the logic, we can add a target
for packaging. Keep the default .gz target the script uses, and actually
extend the supported formats by using tar's autodetection.

To not break current workflows, keep the gen_kselftest_tar.sh script as
it is, with an added suggestion to use the makefile target instead.
