net/mlx5e: Handle errors from netif_set_real_num_{tx,rx}_queues

netif_set_real_num_tx_queues and netif_set_real_num_rx_queues may fail.
Now that mlx5e supports handling errors in the preactivate hook, this
commit leverages that functionality to handle errors from those
functions and roll back all changes on failure.
