include/linux/memblock.h: fix minor typo and unclear comment

Fix a minor typo "usabe->usable" for the current discription of member
variable "memory" in struct memblock.

BTW, I think it's unclear the member variable "base" in struct
memblock_type is currently described as the physical address of memory
region, change it to base address of the region is clearer since the
variable is decorated as phys_addr_t.
