mmc: sdhci: move SDHCI_CAPABILITIES_1 to a more suitable place

In the SDHCI specification, the Capabilities Register (Offset 0x40h)
is the 64-bit width register, but in Linux, it is represented as two
registers, SDHCI_CAPABILITIES and SDHCI_CAPABILITIES_1 so that drivers
can use 32-bit register accessors.

The upper 32-bit field is associated with SDHCI_CAPABILITIES_1.

Move the definition of SDHCI_CAPABILITIES_1 to the correct place.
