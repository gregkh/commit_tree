media: atomisp: Remove binary_supports_input_format

Clang warns:

drivers/staging/media/atomisp/pci/runtime/binary/src/binary.c:1707:64:
warning: implicit conversion from enumeration type 'const enum
ia_css_frame_format' to different enumeration type 'enum
atomisp_input_format' [-Wenum-conversion]
        binary_supports_input_format(xcandidate, req_in_info->format));
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~             ~~~~~~~~~~~~~^~~~~~

As it turns out, binary_supports_input_format only asserts that
xcandidate is not NULL and just returns true so this call is never
actually made.

There are other functions that are called that assert info is not NULL
so this function actually serves no purpose. Remove it. It can be
brought back if needed later.
