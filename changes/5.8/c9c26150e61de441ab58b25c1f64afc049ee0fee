x86/entry: Assert that syscalls are on the right stack

Now that the entry stack is a full page, it's too easy to regress the
system call entry code and end up on the wrong stack without noticing.
Assert that all system calls (SYSCALL64, SYSCALL32, SYSENTER, and INT80)
are on the right stack and have pt_regs in the right place.
