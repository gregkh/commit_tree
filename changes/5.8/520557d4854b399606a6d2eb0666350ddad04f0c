ARM: dts: am5729: beaglebone-ai: adding device tree

BeagleBoard.org BeagleBone AI is an open source hardware single
board computer based on the Texas Instruments AM5729 SoC featuring
dual-core 1.5GHz Arm Cortex-A15 processor, dual-core C66 digital
signal processor (DSP), quad-core embedded vision engine (EVE),
Arm Cortex-M4 processors, dual programmable realtime unit
industrial control subsystems and more. The board features 1GB
DDR3L, USB3.0 Type-C, USB HS Type-A, microHDMI, 16GB eMMC flash,
1G Ethernet, 802.11ac 2/5GHz, Bluetooth, and BeagleBone expansion

This patch introduces the BeagleBone AI device tree.

Note that the device use the "ti,tpd12s016" component which is
software compatible with "ti,tpd12s015". Thus we only use the
latter driver.
