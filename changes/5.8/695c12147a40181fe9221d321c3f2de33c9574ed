bpf, netns: Keep attached programs in bpf_prog_array

Prepare for having multi-prog attachments for new netns attach types by
storing programs to run in a bpf_prog_array, which is well suited for
iterating over programs and running them in sequence.

After this change bpf(PROG_QUERY) may block to allocate memory in
bpf_prog_array_copy_to_user() for collected program IDs. This forces a
change in how we protect access to the attached program in the query
callback. Because bpf_prog_array_copy_to_user() can sleep, we switch from
an RCU read lock to holding a mutex that serializes updaters.

Because we allow only one BPF flow_dissector program to be attached to
netns at all times, the bpf_prog_array pointed by net->bpf.run_array is
always either detached (null) or one element long.

No functional changes intended.
