perf trace: Use zalloc() to make sure all fields are zeroed in the syscalltbl constructor

In the past this wasn't needed as the libaudit based code would use just
one field, and the alternative constructor would fill in all the fields,
but now that even when using the libaudit based method we need the other
fields, switch to zalloc() to make sure the other fields are zeroed at
instantiation time.
