virtio-balloon: Document byte ordering of poison_val

The poison_val field in the virtio_balloon_config is treated as a
little-endian field by the host. Since we are currently only having to deal
with a single byte poison value this isn't a problem, however if the value
should ever expand it would cause byte ordering issues. Document that in
the code so that we know that if the value should ever expand we need to
byte swap the value on big-endian architectures.
