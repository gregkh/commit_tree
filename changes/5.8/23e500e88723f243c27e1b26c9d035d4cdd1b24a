net: atlantic: disable PTP on AQC111, AQC112

This patch disables PTP on AQC111 and AQC112 due to a known HW issue,
which can cause datapath issues.

Ideally PTP block should have been disabled via PHY provisioning, but
unfortunately many units have been shipped with enabled PTP block.
Thus, we have to work around this in the driver.
