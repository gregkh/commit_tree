drm: Cleanups after drmm_add_final_kfree rollout

A few things:
- Update the example driver in the documentation.
- We can drop the old kfree in drm_dev_release.
- Add a WARN_ON check in drm_dev_register to make sure everyone calls
  drmm_add_final_kfree and there's no leaks.

v2: Restore the full cleanup, I accidentally left some moved code
behind when fixing the bisectability of the series.
