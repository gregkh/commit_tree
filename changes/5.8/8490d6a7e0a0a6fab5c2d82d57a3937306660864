drm: hold gem reference until object is no longer accessed

A use-after-free in drm_gem_open_ioctl can happen if the
GEM object handle is closed between the idr lookup and
retrieving the size from said object since a local reference
is not being held at that point. Hold the local reference
while the object can still be accessed to fix this and
plug the potential security hole.
