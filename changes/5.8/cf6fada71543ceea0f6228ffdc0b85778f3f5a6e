cpufreq: change '.set_boost' to act on one policy

Macro 'for_each_active_policy()' is defined internally. To avoid some
cpufreq driver needing this macro to iterate over all the policies in
'.set_boost' callback, we redefine '.set_boost' to act on only one
policy and pass the policy as an argument.

'cpufreq_boost_trigger_state()' iterates over all the policies to set
boost for the system.

This is preparation for adding SW BOOST support for CPPC.

To protect Boost enable/disable by sysfs from CPU online/offline,
add 'cpu_hotplug_lock' before calling '.set_boost' for each CPU.

Also move the lock from 'set_boost()' to 'store_cpb()' in
acpi_cpufreq.
