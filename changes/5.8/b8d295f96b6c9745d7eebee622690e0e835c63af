KVM: nVMX: Remove non-functional "support" for CR3 target values

Remove all references to cr3_target_value[0-3] and replace the fields
in vmcs12 with "dead_space" to preserve the vmcs12 layout.  KVM doesn't
support emulating CR3-target values, despite a variety of code that
implies otherwise, as KVM unconditionally reports '0' for the number of
supported CR3-target values.

This technically fixes a bug where KVM would incorrectly allow VMREAD
and VMWRITE to nonexistent fields, i.e. cr3_target_value[0-3].  Per
Intel's SDM, the number of supported CR3-target values reported in
VMX_MISC also enumerates the existence of the associated VMCS fields:

  If a future implementation supports more than 4 CR3-target values, they
  will be encoded consecutively following the 4 encodings given here.

Alternatively, the "bug" could be fixed by actually advertisting support
for 4 CR3-target values, but that'd likely just enable kvm-unit-tests
given that no one has complained about lack of support for going on ten
years, e.g. KVM, Xen and HyperV don't use CR3-target values.
