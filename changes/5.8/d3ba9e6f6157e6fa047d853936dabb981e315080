igc: Fix 'sw_idx' type in struct igc_nfc_rule

The 'sw_idx' field from 'struct igc_nfc_rule' is u16 type but it is
assigned an u32 value in igc_ethtool_init_nfc_rule(). This patch changes
'sw_idx' type to u32 so they match. Also, it makes more sense to call
this field 'location' since it holds the NFC rule location.
