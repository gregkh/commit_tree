spi: dw: Discard dma_width member of the dw_spi structure

This member has exactly the same value as n_bytes of the DW SPI private
data object, it's calculated at the same point of the transfer method,
n_bytes isn't changed during the whole transfer, and they even serve for
the same purpose - keep number of bytes per transfer word, though the
dma_width is used only to calculate the DMA source/destination addresses
width, which n_bytes could be also utilized for. Taking all of these
into account let's replace the dma_width member usage with n_bytes one
and remove the former.
