sfc: Add XDP frame size

This driver uses RX page-split when possible. It was recently fixed
in commit 86e85bf6981c ("sfc: fix XDP-redirect in this driver") to
add needed tailroom for XDP-redirect.

After the fix efx->rx_page_buf_step is the frame size, with enough
head and tail-room for XDP-redirect.
