igc: Remove mac_table from igc_adapter

In igc_adapter we keep a sort of shadow copy of RAL and RAH registers.
There is not much benefit in keeping it, at the cost of maintainability,
since adding/removing MAC address filters is not hot path, and we
already keep filters information in adapter->nfc_filter_list for cleanup
and restoration purposes.

So in order to simplify the MAC address filtering code and prepare it
for source address support, this patch removes the mac_table from
igc_adapter.
