drm/i915/gt: Avoid uninitialized use of rpcurupei in frequency_show

When building with clang + -Wuninitialized:

drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gt/debugfs_gt_pm.c:407:7: warning: variable
'rpcurupei' is uninitialized when used here [-Wuninitialized]
                           rpcurupei,
                           ^~~~~~~~~
drivers/gpu/drm/i915/gt/debugfs_gt_pm.c:304:16: note: initialize the
variable 'rpcurupei' to silence this warning
                u32 rpcurupei, rpcurup, rpprevup;
                             ^
                              = 0
1 warning generated.

rpupei is assigned twice; based on the second argument to
intel_uncore_read, it seems this one should have been assigned to
rpcurupei.
