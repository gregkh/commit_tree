tipc: add support for broadcast rcv stats dumping

This commit enables dumping the statistics of a broadcast-receiver link
like the traditional 'broadcast-link' one (which is for broadcast-
sender). The link dumping can be triggered via netlink (e.g. the
iproute2/tipc tool) by the link flag - 'TIPC_NLA_LINK_BROADCAST' as the
indicator.

The name of a broadcast-receiver link of a specific peer will be in the
format: 'broadcast-link:<peer-id>'.

For example:

Link <broadcast-link:1001002>
  Window:50 packets
  RX packets:7841 fragments:2408/440 bundles:0/0
  TX packets:0 fragments:0/0 bundles:0/0
  RX naks:0 defs:124 dups:0
  TX naks:21 acks:0 retrans:0
  Congestion link:0  Send queue max:0 avg:0

In addition, the broadcast-receiver link statistics can be reset in the
usual way via netlink by specifying that link name in command.

Note: the 'tipc_link_name_ext()' is removed because the link name can
now be retrieved simply via the 'l->name'.
