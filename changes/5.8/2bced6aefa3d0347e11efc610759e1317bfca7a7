net/smc: put slot when connection is killed

To get a send slot smc_wr_tx_get_free_slot() is called, which might
wait for a free slot. When smc_wr_tx_get_free_slot() returns there is a
check if the connection was killed in the meantime. In that case don't
only return an error, but also put back the free slot.
