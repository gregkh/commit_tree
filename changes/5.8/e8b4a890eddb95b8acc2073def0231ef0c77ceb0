media: atomisp: Get rid of ACPI specifics in gmin_subdev_add()

First of all ACPI HID is a part of the device name which is printed
as a part of the dev_info(dev, ...); line. Second, since the only BID
is left, it's a part of ACPI path, which can be printed via %pfw.

Besides that, drop ACPI handle from atomisp_get_acpi_power() parameters.
