x86/mcelog: Add compat_ioctl for 32-bit mcelog support

A 32-bit version of mcelog issuing ioctls on /dev/mcelog causes errors
like the following:

  MCE_GET_RECORD_LEN: Inappropriate ioctl for device

This is due to a missing compat_ioctl callback.

Assign to it compat_ptr_ioctl() as a generic implementation of the
.compat_ioctl file operation to ioctl functions that either ignore the
argument or pass a pointer to a compatible data type.
