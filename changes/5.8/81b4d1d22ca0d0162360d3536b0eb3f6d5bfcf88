Input: evdev - use keyed wakeups

Some processes, such as systemd, are only polling for EPOLLERR|EPOLLHUP.
As evdev uses unkeyed wakeups, such a poll receives many spurious
wakeups from uninteresting events.

Use keyed wakeups to allow the wakeup target to more efficiently discard
these uninteresting events.
