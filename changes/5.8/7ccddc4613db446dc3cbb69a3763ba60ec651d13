x86/mce/dev-mcelog: Fix -Wstringop-truncation warning about strncpy()

The kbuild test robot reported this warning:

  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/dev-mcelog.c: In function 'dev_mcelog_init_device':
  arch/x86/kernel/cpu/mce/dev-mcelog.c:346:2: warning: 'strncpy' output \
    truncated before terminating nul copying 12 bytes from a string of the \
    same length [-Wstringop-truncation]

This is accurate, but I don't care that the trailing NUL character isn't
copied. The string being copied is just a magic number signature so that
crash dump tools can be sure they are decoding the right blob of memory.

Use memcpy() instead of strncpy().
