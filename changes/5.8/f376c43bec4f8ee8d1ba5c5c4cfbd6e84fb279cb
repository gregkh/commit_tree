clk: bcm2835: Fix return type of bcm2835_register_gate

bcm2835_register_gate is used as a callback for the clk_register member
of bcm2835_clk_desc, which expects a struct clk_hw * return type but
bcm2835_register_gate returns a struct clk *.

This discrepancy is hidden by the fact that bcm2835_register_gate is
cast to the typedef bcm2835_clk_register by the _REGISTER macro. This
turns out to be a control flow integrity violation, which is how this
was noticed.

Change the return type of bcm2835_register_gate to be struct clk_hw *
and use clk_hw_register_gate to do so. This should be a non-functional
change as clk_register_gate calls clk_hw_register_gate anyways but this
is needed to avoid issues with further changes.
