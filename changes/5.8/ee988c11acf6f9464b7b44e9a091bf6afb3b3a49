powerpc: Add new HWCAP bits

POWER10 introduces two new architectural features - ISAv3.1 and matrix
multiply assist (MMA) instructions. Userspace detects the presence
of these features via two HWCAP bits introduced in this patch. These
bits have been agreed to by the compiler and binutils team.

According to ISAv3.1 MMA is an optional feature and software that makes
use of it should first check for availability via this HWCAP bit and use
alternate code paths if unavailable.
