pstore/blk: Support non-block storage devices

Add support for non-block devices (e.g. MTD). A non-block driver calls
pstore_blk_register_device() to register iself.

In addition, pstore/zone is updated to handle non-block devices,
where an erase must be done before a write. Without this, there is no
way to remove records stored to an MTD.
