perf/x86/rapl: Refactor to share the RAPL code between Intel and AMD CPUs

This patch modifies the rapl_model struct to include architecture specific
knowledge in this previously Intel specific structure, and in particular
it adds the MSR for POWER_UNIT and the rapl_msrs array.

No functional changes.
