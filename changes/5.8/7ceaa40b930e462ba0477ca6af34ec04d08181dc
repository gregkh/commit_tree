soundwire: bus_type: add sdw_master_device support

In the existing SoundWire code, Master Devices are not explicitly
represented - only SoundWire Slave Devices are exposed (the use of
capital letters follows the SoundWire specification conventions).

With the existing code, the bus is handled without using a proper device,
and bus->dev typically points to a platform device. The right thing to
do as discussed in multiple reviews is use a device for each bus.

The sdw_master_device addition is done with minimal internal plumbing
and not exposed externally. The existing API based on
sdw_bus_master_add() and sdw_bus_master_delete() will deal with the
sdw_master_device life cycle, which minimizes changes to existing
drivers.

Note that the Intel code will be modified in follow-up patches (no
impact on any platform since the connection with ASoC is not supported
upstream so far).
