arm64/cpufeature: Add get_arm64_ftr_reg_nowarn()

There is no way to proceed when requested register could not be searched in
arm64_ftr_reg[]. Requesting for a non present register would be an error as
well. Hence lets just WARN_ON() when search fails in get_arm64_ftr_reg()
rather than checking for return value and doing a BUG_ON() instead in some
individual callers. But there are also caller instances that dont error out
when register search fails. Add a new helper get_arm64_ftr_reg_nowarn() for
such cases.
