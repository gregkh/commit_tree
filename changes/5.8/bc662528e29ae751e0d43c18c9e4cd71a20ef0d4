drm/v3d: Delete v3d_dev->dev

We already have it in v3d_dev->drm.dev with zero additional pointer
chasing. Personally I don't like duplicated pointers like this
because:
- reviewers need to check whether the pointer is for the same or
  different objects if there's multiple
- compilers have an easier time too

But also a bit a bikeshed, so feel free to ignore.
