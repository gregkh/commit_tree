Documentation/features: Correct RISC-V kprobes support entry

The Documentation/features/debug/kprobes/arch-support.txt incorrectly
states that RISC-V has kprobes support. This is not the case.

Note that entries that have been incorrectly marked with 'ok' will not
be changed back to 'TODO' by the features-refresh.sh script.
