ext4: fix fiemap size checks for bitmap files

Add an extra validation of the len parameter, as for ext4 some files
might have smaller file size limits than others.  This also means the
redundant size check in ext4_ioctl_get_es_cache can go away, as all
size checking is done in the shared fiemap handler.
