ASoC: dt-bindings: fsl_asrc: Add new property fsl, asrc-format

In order to support new EASRC and simplify the code structure,
We decide to share the common structure between them. This bring
a problem that EASRC accept format directly from devicetree, but
ASRC accept width from devicetree.

In order to align with new ESARC, we add new property fsl,asrc-format.
The fsl,asrc-format can replace the fsl,asrc-width, then driver
can accept format from devicetree, don't need to convert it to
format through width.
