drm/amdkfd: Enable over-subscription with >1 GWS queue

The current GWS usage model will only allows a single GWS-enabled
process to be active on the GPU at once. This ensures that a
barrier-using kernel gets a known amount of GPU hardware, to
prevent deadlock due to inability to go beyond the GWS barrier.

The HWS watches how many GWS entries are assigned to each process,
and goes into over-subscription mode when two processes need more
than the 64 that are available. The current KFD method for working
with this is to allocate all 64 GWS entries to each GWS-capable
process.

When more than one GWS-enabled process is in the runlist, we must
make sure the runlist is in over-subscription mode, so that the
HWS gets a chained RUN_LIST packet and continues scheduling
kernels.
