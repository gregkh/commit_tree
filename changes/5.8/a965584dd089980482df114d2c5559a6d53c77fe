dt-bindings: display: convert sharp,ls043t1le01 to DT Schema

The txt binding specified the property "power-supply".
But the example and the actual implementation in the linux-kernel
uses "avdd-supply".
So the binding is adjusted to use avdd-supply as this seems
to be the correct choice.
There are no DT files in the linux kernel to check.
