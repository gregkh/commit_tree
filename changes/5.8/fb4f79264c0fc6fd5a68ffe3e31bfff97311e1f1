net/smc: tolerate future SMCD versions

CLC proposal messages of future SMCD versions could be larger than SMCD
V1 CLC proposal messages.
To enable toleration in SMC V1 the receival of CLC proposal messages
is adapted:
* accept larger length values in CLC proposal
* check trailing eye catcher for incoming CLC proposal with V1 length only
* receive the whole CLC proposal even in cases it does not fit into the
  V1 buffer
