9p/trans_fd: Fix concurrency del of req_list in p9_fd_cancelled/p9_read_work

p9_read_work and p9_fd_cancelled may be called concurrently.
In some cases, req->req_list may be deleted by both p9_read_work
and p9_fd_cancelled.

We can fix it by ignoring replies associated with a cancelled
request and ignoring cancelled request if message has been received
before lock.
