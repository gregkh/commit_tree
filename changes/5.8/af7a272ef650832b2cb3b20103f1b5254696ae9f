drm/i915/gt: Only delay the context barrier pm

It is strictly sufficient to only delay the intel_engine_pm_put from the
context barrier (and not from the context exit) in order to prevent the
gem_exec_nop contention. Adding the delay to the context exit incurs
noticably extra penalty for soft-rc6.
