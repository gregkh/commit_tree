scsi: hisi_sas: Do not reset phy timer to wait for stray phy up

We found out that after phy up, the hardware reports another oob interrupt
but did not follow a phy up interrupt:

oob ready -> phy up -> DEV found -> oob read -> wait phy up -> timeout

We run link reset when wait phy up timeout, and it send a normal disk into
reset processing. So we made some circumvention action in the code, so that
this abnormal oob interrupt will not start the timer to wait for phy up.
