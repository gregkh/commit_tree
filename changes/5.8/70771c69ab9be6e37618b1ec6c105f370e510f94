firmware: arm_scmi: Add include guard to linux/scmi_protocol.h

If this header is include twice, it will generate loads of compile
time error with the following below error pattern. It was reported by
0day kbuild robot on a branch pushed with double inclusion by accident.

 	error: conflicting types for ‘...’
 	note: previous declaration of ‘...’ was here
	error: redefinition of ‘...’

Add a header include guard just in case.
