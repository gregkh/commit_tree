net/smc: switch connections to alternate link

Add smc_switch_conns() to switch all connections from a link that is
going down. Find an other link to switch the connections to, and
switch each connection to the new link. smc_switch_cursor() updates the
cursors of a connection to the state of the last successfully sent CDC
message. When there is no link to switch to, terminate the link group.
Call smc_switch_conns() when a link is going down.
And with the possibility that links of connections can switch adapt CDC
and TX functions to detect and handle link switches.
