kcsan: Expose core configuration parameters as module params

This adds early_boot, udelay_{task,interrupt}, and skip_watch as module
params. The latter parameters are useful to modify at runtime to tune
KCSAN's performance on new systems. This will also permit auto-tuning
these parameters to maximize overall system performance and KCSAN's race
detection ability.

None of the parameters are used in the fast-path and referring to them
via static variables instead of CONFIG constants will not affect
performance.
