drm/i915: use forced codec wake on all gen9+ platforms

Commit 632f3ab95fe2 ("drm/i915/audio: add codec wakeup override
enabled/disable callback"), added logic to toggle Codec Wake on gen9.
This is used by audio driver when it resets the HDA controller.

It seems explicit toggling of the wakeline can help to fix problems
with probe failing on some gen12 platforms. And based on specs, there
is no reason why this programming sequence should not be applied to all
gen9+ platforms. No side-effects are seen on gen10/11. So apply
the wake-logic to all gen9+ platforms.
