x86/tlb: Uninline __get_current_cr3_fast()

cpu_tlbstate is exported because various TLB-related functions need
access to it, but cpu_tlbstate is sensitive information which should
only be accessed by well-contained kernel functions and not be directly
exposed to modules.

In preparation for unexporting cpu_tlbstate move __get_current_cr3_fast()
into the x86 TLB management code.

No functional change.
