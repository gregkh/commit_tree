KVM: arm64: Save the host's PtrAuth keys in non-preemptible context

When using the PtrAuth feature in a guest, we need to save the host's
keys before allowing the guest to program them. For that, we dump
them in a per-CPU data structure (the so called host context).

But both call sites that do this are in preemptible context,
which may end up in disaster should the vcpu thread get preempted
before reentering the guest.

Instead, save the keys eagerly on each vcpu_load(). This has an
increased overhead, but is at least safe.
