doc: don't use deprecated "---help---" markers in target docs

I'm not convinced the script makes useful automaed help lines anyway,
but since we're trying to deprecate the use of "---help---" in Kconfig
files, let's fix the doc example code too.

See commit a7f7f6248d97 ("treewide: replace '---help---' in Kconfig
files with 'help'")
