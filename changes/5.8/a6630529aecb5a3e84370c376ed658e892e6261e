ALSA: hda: Workaround for spurious wakeups on some Intel platforms

We've received a regression report on Intel HD-audio controller that
wakes up immediately after S3 suspend.  The bisection leads to the
commit c4c8dd6ef807 ("ALSA: hda: Skip controller resume if not
needed").  This commit replaces the system-suspend to use
pm_runtime_force_suspend() instead of the direct call of
__azx_runtime_suspend().  However, by some really mysterious reason,
pm_runtime_force_suspend() causes a spurious wakeup (although it calls
the same __azx_runtime_suspend() internally).

As an ugly workaround for now, revert the behavior to call
__azx_runtime_suspend() and __azx_runtime_resume() for those old Intel
platforms that may exhibit such a problem, while keeping the new
standard pm_runtime_force_suspend() and pm_runtime_force_resume()
pair for the remaining chips.
