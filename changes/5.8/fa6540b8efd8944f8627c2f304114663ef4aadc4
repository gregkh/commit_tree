nfp: Add XDP frame size to netronome driver

The netronome nfp driver use PAGE_SIZE when xdp_prog is set, but
xdp.data_hard_start begins at offset NFP_NET_RX_BUF_HEADROOM.
Thus, adjust for this when setting xdp.frame_sz, as it counts
from data_hard_start.

When doing XDP_TX this driver is smart and instead of a full DMA-map
does a DMA-sync on with packet length. As xdp_adjust_tail can now
grow packet length, add checks to make sure that grow size is within
the DMA-mapped size.
