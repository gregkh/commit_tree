mmc: sdio: Fix macro name for Marvell device with ID 0x9134

Marvell SDIO device ID 0x9134 is used in SDIO Common CIS (Card Information
Structure) and not in SDIO wlan function (with ID 1). SDIO Common CIS is
accessed by function ID 0.

So change this misleading macro name to SDIO_DEVICE_ID_MARVELL_8887_F0 as
it does not refer to wlan function. It refers to function 0.

Wlan module on this SDIO card is available at function ID 1 and is
identified by different SDIO device ID 0x9135. Kernel quirks for SDIO
devices are matched against device ID from SDIO Common CIS. Therefore
device ID used in quirk is correct, just has misleading name.
