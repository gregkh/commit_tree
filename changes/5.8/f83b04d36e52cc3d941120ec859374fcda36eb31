kgdb: Add kgdb_has_hit_break function

The break instruction in RISC-V does not have an immediate value field, so
the kernel cannot identify the purpose of each trap exception through the
opcode. This makes the existing identification schemes in other
architecture unsuitable for the RISC-V kernel. To solve this problem, this
patch adds kgdb_has_hit_break(), which can help RISC-V kernel identify
the KGDB trap exception.
