i2c: designware: Discard Cherry Trail model flag

A PM workaround activated by the flag MODEL_CHERRYTRAIL has been removed
since commit 9cbeeca05049 ("i2c: designware: Remove Cherry Trail PMIC I2C
bus pm_disabled workaround"), but the flag most likely by mistake has been
left in the Dw I2C drivers. Let's remove it. Since MODEL_MSCC_OCELOT is
the only model-flag left, redefine it to be 0x100 so setting a very first
bit in the MODEL_MASK bits range.
