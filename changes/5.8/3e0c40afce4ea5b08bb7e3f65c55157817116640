net/smc: add termination reason and handle LLC protocol violation

Allow to set the reason code for the link group termination, and set
meaningful values before termination processing is triggered. This
reason code is sent to the peer in the final delete link message.
When the LLC request or response layer receives a message type that was
not handled, drop a warning and terminate the link group.
