ASoC: soc-dai: set dai_link dpcm_ flags with a helper

Add a helper to walk through all the DAIs and set dpcm_playback and
dpcm_capture flags based on the DAIs capabilities, and use this helper
to avoid setting these flags arbitrarily in generic cards.

The commit referenced in the Fixes tag did not introduce the
configuration issue but will prevent the card from probing when
detecting invalid configurations.
