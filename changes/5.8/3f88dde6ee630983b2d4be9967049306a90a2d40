drm/i915/gt: Apply the aggressive downclocking to parking

We treat parking as a manual RPS timeout event, and downclock the GPU
for the next unpark and batch execution. However, having restored the
aggressive downclocking and observed that we have very light workloads
whose only interaction is through the manual parking events, carry over
the aggressive downclocking to the fake RPS events.
