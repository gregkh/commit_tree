kernel/sysctl.c: ignore out-of-range taint bits introduced via kernel.tainted

Users with SYS_ADMIN capability can add arbitrary taint flags to the
running kernel by writing to /proc/sys/kernel/tainted or issuing the
command 'sysctl -w kernel.tainted=...'.  This interface, however, is
open for any integer value and this might cause an invalid set of flags
being committed to the tainted_mask bitset.

This patch introduces a simple way for proc_taint() to ignore any
eventual invalid bit coming from the user input before committing those
bits to the kernel tainted_mask.
