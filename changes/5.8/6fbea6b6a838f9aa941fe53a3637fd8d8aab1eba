ASoC: soc-card: export snd_soc_lookup_component_nolocked

snd_soc_lookup_component_nolocked can be used for the DPCM case
that Front-End needs to get the unused platform component but
added by Back-End cpu dai driver.

If the component is gotten, then we can get the dma chan created
by Back-End component and reused it in Front-End.
