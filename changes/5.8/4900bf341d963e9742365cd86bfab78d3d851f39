net: ipa: have ipa_endpoint_init_ctrl() return previous state

Change ipa_endpoint_init_ctrl() so it returns the previous state
(whether suspend or delay mode was enabled) rather than indicating
whether the request caused a change in state.  This makes it easier
to understand what's happening where called.
