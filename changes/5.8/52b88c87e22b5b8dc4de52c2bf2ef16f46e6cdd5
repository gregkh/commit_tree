media: pwc-if.c: Update comments about each pwc supported model

The USB_DEVICE() list contain some of the product names, but
some are missing, and others are different than the message
printed during device detection.

Update the comments in order to match what the driver prints.

That makes easier to discover what model matches what physical
device.
