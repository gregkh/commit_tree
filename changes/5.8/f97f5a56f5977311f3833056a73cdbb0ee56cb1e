x86/kvm/hyper-v: Add support for synthetic debugger interface

Add support for Hyper-V synthetic debugger (syndbg) interface.
The syndbg interface is using MSRs to emulate a way to send/recv packets
data.

The debug transport dll (kdvm/kdnet) will identify if Hyper-V is enabled
and if it supports the synthetic debugger interface it will attempt to
use it, instead of trying to initialize a network adapter.
