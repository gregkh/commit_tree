mac80211: avoid using ext NSS high BW if not supported

If the AP advertises inconsistent data, namely it has CCFS1 or CCFS2,
but doesn't advertise support for 160/80+80 bandwidth or "Extended NSS
BW Support", then we cannot use any MCSes in the the higher bandwidth.
Thus, avoid connecting with higher bandwidth since it's less efficient
that way.
