KVM: VMX: Cache vmcs.EXIT_INTR_INFO using arch avail_reg flags

Introduce a new "extended register" type, EXIT_INFO_2 (to pair with the
nomenclature in .get_exit_info()), and use it to cache VMX's
vmcs.EXIT_INTR_INFO.  Drop a comment in vmx_recover_nmi_blocking() that
is obsoleted by the generic caching mechanism.
