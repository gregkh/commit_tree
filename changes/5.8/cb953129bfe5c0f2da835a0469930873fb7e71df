kvm: add halt-polling cpu usage stats

Two new stats for exposing halt-polling cpu usage:
halt_poll_success_ns
halt_poll_fail_ns

Thus sum of these 2 stats is the total cpu time spent polling. "success"
means the VCPU polled until a virtual interrupt was delivered. "fail"
means the VCPU had to schedule out (either because the maximum poll time
was reached or it needed to yield the CPU).

To avoid touching every arch's kvm_vcpu_stat struct, only update and
export halt-polling cpu usage stats if we're on x86.

Exporting cpu usage as a u64 and in nanoseconds means we will overflow at
~500 years, which seems reasonably large.
