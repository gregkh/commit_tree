net: ks8851: Use 16-bit writes to program MAC address

On the SPI variant of KS8851, the MAC address can be programmed with
either 8/16/32-bit writes. To make it easier to support the 16-bit
parallel option of KS8851 too, switch both the MAC address programming
and readout to 16-bit operations.

Remove ks8851_wrreg8() as it is not used anywhere anymore.

There should be no functional change.
