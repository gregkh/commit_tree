habanalabs: support clock gating enable/disable

In Gaudi there is a feature of clock gating certain engines.
Therefore, add this property to the device structure.

In addition, due to a limitation of this feature, the driver needs to
dynamically enable or disable this feature during run-time. Therefore, add
ASIC interface functions to enable/disable this function from the common
code.

Moreover, this feature must be turned off when the user wishes to debug the
ASIC by reading/writing registers and/or memory through the driver's
debugfs. Therefore, add an option to enable/disable clock gating via the
debugfs interface.
