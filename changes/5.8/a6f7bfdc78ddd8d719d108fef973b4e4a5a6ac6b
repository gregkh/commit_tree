net: hns3: add reset check for VF updating port based VLAN

Currently hclgevf_update_port_base_vlan_info() may be called when
VF is resetting,  which may cause hns3_nic_net_open() being called
twice unexpectedly.

So fix it by adding a reset check for it, and extend critical
region for rntl_lock in hclgevf_update_port_base_vlan_info().
