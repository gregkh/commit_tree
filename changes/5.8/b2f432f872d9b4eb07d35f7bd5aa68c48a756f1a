KVM: x86/mmu: Tweak PSE hugepage handling to avoid 2M vs 4M conundrum

Change the PSE hugepage handling in walk_addr_generic() to fire on any
page level greater than PT_PAGE_TABLE_LEVEL, a.k.a. PG_LEVEL_4K.  PSE
paging only has two levels, so "== 2" and "> 1" are functionally the
same, i.e. this is a nop.

A future patch will drop KVM's PT_*_LEVEL enums in favor of the kernel's
PG_LEVEL_* enums, at which point "walker->level == PG_LEVEL_2M" is
semantically incorrect (though still functionally ok).

No functional change intended.
