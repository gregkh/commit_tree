enetc: permit configuration of rx-vlan-filter with ethtool

Each ENETC station interface (SI) has a VLAN filter list and a port
flag (PSIPVMR) by which it can be put in "VLAN promiscuous" mode, which
enables the reception of VLAN-tagged traffic even if it is not in the
VLAN filtering list.

Currently the handling of this setting works like this: the port starts
off as VLAN promiscuous, then it switches to enabling VLAN filtering as
soon as the first VLAN is installed in its filter via
.ndo_vlan_rx_add_vid. In practice that does not work out very well,
because more often than not, the first VLAN to be installed is out of
the control of the user: the 8021q module, if loaded, adds its rule for
802.1p (VID 0) traffic upon bringing the interface up.

What the user is currently seeing in ethtool is this:
ethtool -k eno2
rx-vlan-filter: on [fixed]

which doesn't match the intention of the code, but the practical reality
of having the 8021q module install its VID which has the side-effect of
turning on VLAN filtering in this driver. All in all, a slightly
confusing experience.

So instead of letting this driver switch the VLAN filtering state by
itself, just wire it up with the rx-vlan-filter feature from ethtool,
and let it be user-configurable just through that knob, except for one
case, see below.

In promiscuous mode, it is more intuitive that all traffic is received,
including VLAN tagged traffic. It appears that it is necessary to set
the flag in PSIPVMR for that to be the case, so VLAN promiscuous mode is
also temporarily enabled. On exit from promiscuous mode, the setting
made by ethtool is restored.
