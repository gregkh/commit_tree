staging: wfx: fix race between configure_filter and remove_interface

wfx_remove_interface() and wfx_configure_filter() can be run
concurrently. Therefore, this patch protect access to the list of
interfaces from wfx_configure_filter().

Notice that wfx_configure_filter() now lock "conf_lock" and "scan_lock".
Beside that, wfx_hw_scan_work() also access to the same locks. So we
have to lock them in same order to avoid any deadlock.
