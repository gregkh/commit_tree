media: coda: mark last capture buffer

If a JPEG decoding application queues the last capture and output
buffers, issues a decoder stop command after the decoding is already
done, and then dequeues the last capture buffer, it is not marked as
last. Detect this condition in the decoder stop command and mark the
last buffer on the capture done list.
