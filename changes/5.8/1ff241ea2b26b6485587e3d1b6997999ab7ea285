drm/i915: Do pipe updates after enables for everyone

Currently only port sync pipes do the sequence such that
we first do the modeset part for every pipe and then do
the plane/etc. updates. Let's follow that apporach for
all pipes in skl+ so that we can properly integrate the
port sync into the normal modeset flow.

v2: Remove now stale TODO of port sync slave entries[]
