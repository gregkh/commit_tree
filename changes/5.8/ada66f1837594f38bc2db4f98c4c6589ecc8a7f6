arm64: Reorder the macro arguments in the copy routines

The current argument order is obviously buggy (memcpy.S):

	macro strb1 ptr, regB, val
	strb \ptr, [\regB], \val
	endm

However, it cancels out as the calling sites in copy_template.S pass the
address as the regB argument.

Mechanically reorder the arguments to match the instruction mnemonics.
There is no difference in objdump before and after this patch.
