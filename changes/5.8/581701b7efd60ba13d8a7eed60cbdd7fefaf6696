uapi: deprecate STATX_ALL

Constants of the *_ALL type can be actively harmful due to the fact that
developers will usually fail to consider the possible effects of future
changes to the definition.

Deprecate STATX_ALL in the uapi, while no damage has been done yet.

We could keep something like this around in the kernel, but there's
actually no point, since all filesystems should be explicitly checking
flags that they support and not rely on the VFS masking unknown ones out: a
flag could be known to the VFS, yet not known to the filesystem.
