ARM: 8984/1: Kconfig: set default ZBOOT_ROM_TEXT/BSS value to 0x0

ZBOOT_ROM_TEXT and ZBOOT_ROM_BSS are defined as 'hex' but had a default
of "0". Kconfig will helpfully expand a text entry of 0 to 0x0 but
because this is not the same as the default value it was treated as
being explicitly set when running 'make savedefconfig' so most arm
defconfigs have CONFIG_ZBOOT_ROM_TEXT=0x0 and CONFIG_ZBOOT_ROM_BSS=0x0.

Change the default to 0x0 which will mean next time the defconfigs are
re-generated the spurious config entries will be removed.
