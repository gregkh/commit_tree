KVM: SVM: always update CR3 in VMCB

svm_load_mmu_pgd is delaying the write of GUEST_CR3 to prepare_vmcs02 as
an optimization, but this is only correct before the nested vmentry.
If userspace is modifying CR3 with KVM_SET_SREGS after the VM has
already been put in guest mode, the value of CR3 will not be updated.
Remove the optimization, which almost never triggers anyway.
This was was added in commit 689f3bf21628 ("KVM: x86: unify callbacks
to load paging root", 2020-03-16) just to keep the two vendor-specific
modules closer, but we'll fix VMX too.
