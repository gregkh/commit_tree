rhashtable: Fix unprotected RCU dereference in __rht_ptr

The rcu_dereference call in rht_ptr_rcu is completely bogus because
we've already dereferenced the value in __rht_ptr and operated on it.
This causes potential double readings which could be fatal.  The RCU
dereference must occur prior to the comparison in __rht_ptr.

This patch changes the order of RCU dereference so that it is done
first and the result is then fed to __rht_ptr.  The RCU marking
changes have been minimised using casts which will be removed in
a follow-up patch.
