KVM: SVM: immediately inject INTR vmexit

We can immediately leave SVM guest mode in svm_check_nested_events
now that we have the nested_run_pending mechanism.  This makes
things easier because we can run the rest of inject_pending_event
with GIF=0, and KVM will naturally end up requesting the next
interrupt window.
