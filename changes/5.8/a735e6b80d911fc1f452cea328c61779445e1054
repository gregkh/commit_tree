media: cec/usb: depends on USB_SUPPORT and TTY

As reported by Randy:

	WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for USB
	  Depends on [n]: USB_SUPPORT [=n] && USB_ARCH_HAS_HCD [=n]
	  Selected by [m]:
	  - USB_RAINSHADOW_CEC [=m] && MEDIA_CEC_SUPPORT [=y]

	WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for USB_ACM
	  Depends on [n]: USB_SUPPORT [=n] && USB [=m] && TTY [=n]
	  Selected by [m]:
	  - USB_RAINSHADOW_CEC [=m] && MEDIA_CEC_SUPPORT [=y]

in order to be able to select USB_ACM, we need both USB_SUPPORT
and TTY. So, depends on those two.
