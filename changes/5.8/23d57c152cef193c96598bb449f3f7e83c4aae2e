staging: wfx: request to send beacons in IBSS mode

Currently, firmware take in charge of start/stop sending beacons while
in IBSS mode. However, this behavior may change in the further releases.

Currently, asking to firmware to send beacon while in IBSS mode return
an error but is harmless.

Therefore, send this request unconditionally.
