KVM: VMX: Optimize posted-interrupt delivery for timer fastpath

While optimizing posted-interrupt delivery especially for the timer
fastpath scenario, I measured kvm_x86_ops.deliver_posted_interrupt()
to introduce substantial latency because the processor has to perform
all vmentry tasks, ack the posted interrupt notification vector,
read the posted-interrupt descriptor etc.

This is not only slow, it is also unnecessary when delivering an
interrupt to the current CPU (as is the case for the LAPIC timer) because
PIR->IRR and IRR->RVI synchronization is already performed on vmentry
Therefore skip kvm_vcpu_trigger_posted_interrupt in this case, and
instead do vmx_sync_pir_to_irr() on the EXIT_FASTPATH_REENTER_GUEST
fastpath as well.
