net: dsa: provide an option for drivers to always receive bridge VLANs

DSA assumes that a bridge which has vlan filtering disabled is not
vlan aware, and ignores all vlan configuration. However, the kernel
software bridge code allows configuration in this state.

This causes the kernel's idea of the bridge vlan state and the
hardware state to disagree, so "bridge vlan show" indicates a correct
configuration but the hardware lacks all configuration. Even worse,
enabling vlan filtering on a DSA bridge immediately blocks all traffic
which, given the output of "bridge vlan show", is very confusing.

Provide an option that drivers can set to indicate they want to receive
vlan configuration even when vlan filtering is disabled. At the very
least, this is safe for Marvell DSA bridges, which do not look up
ingress traffic in the VTU if the port is in 8021Q disabled state. It is
also safe for the Ocelot switch family. Whether this change is suitable
for all DSA bridges is not known.
