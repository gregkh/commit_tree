powerpc/8xx: Refactor kernel address boundary comparison

Now that linear and IMMR dedicated TLB handling is gone, kernel
boundary address comparison is similar in ITLB miss handler and
in DTLB miss handler.

Create a macro named compare_to_kernel_boundary.

When TASK_SIZE is strictly below 0x80000000 and PAGE_OFFSET is
above 0x80000000, it is enough to compare to 0x8000000, and this
can be done with a single instruction.

Using not. instruction, we get to use 'blt' conditional branch as
when doing a regular comparison:

0x00000000 <= addr <= 0x7fffffff ==>
0xffffffff >= NOT(addr) >= 0x80000000
The above test corresponds to a 'blt'

Otherwise, do a regular comparison using two instructions.
