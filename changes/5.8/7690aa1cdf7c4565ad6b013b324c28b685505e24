netlink: limit recursion depth in policy validation

Now that we have nested policies, we can theoretically
recurse forever parsing attributes if a (sub-)policy
refers back to a higher level one. This is a situation
that has happened in nl80211, and we've avoided it there
by not linking it.

Add some code to netlink parsing to limit recursion depth.
