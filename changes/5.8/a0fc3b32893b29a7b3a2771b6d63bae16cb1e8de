riscv: Add -fPIC option to CFLAGS_vgettimeofday.o

The time related vDSO functions use a variable, vdso_data, to access the
vDSO data page to get the system time information. Because the vdso_data
for CFLAGS_vgettimeofday.o is an external variable defined in vdso.o,
the CFLAGS_vgettimeofday.o should be compiled with -fPIC to ensure
that vdso_data is addressable.
