ceph: add dentry lease metric support

For dentry leases, only count the hit/miss info triggered from the vfs
calls. For the cases like request reply handling and ceph_trim_dentries,
ignore them.

For now, these are only viewable using debugfs. Future patches will
allow the client to send the stats to the MDS.

The output looks like:

item          total           miss            hit
-------------------------------------------------
d_lease       11              7               141
