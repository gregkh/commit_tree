dt-bindings: clk: Add Baikal-T1 CCU PLLs binding

Baikal-T1 Clocks Control Unit is responsible for transformation of a
signal coming from an external oscillator into clocks of various
frequencies to propagate them then to the corresponding clocks
consumers (either individual IP-blocks or clock domains). In order
to create a set of high-frequency clocks the external signal is
firstly handled by the embedded into CCU PLLs. So the corresponding
dts-node is just a normal clock-provider node with standard set of
properties. Note as being part of the Baikal-T1 System Controller its
DT node is supposed to be a child the system controller node.
