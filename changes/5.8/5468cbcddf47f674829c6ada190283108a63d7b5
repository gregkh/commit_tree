net: ipa: always check for stopped channel

In gsi_channel_stop(), there's a check to see if the channel might
have entered STOPPED state since a previous call, which might have
timed out before stopping completed.

That check actually belongs in gsi_channel_stop_command(), which is
called repeatedly by gsi_channel_stop() for RX channels.
