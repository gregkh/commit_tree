r8169: fix firmware not resetting tp->ocp_base

Typically the firmware takes care that tp->ocp_base is reset to its
default value. That's not the case (at least) for RTL8117.
As a result subsequent PHY access reads/writes the wrong page and
the link is broken. Fix this be resetting tp->ocp_base explicitly.
