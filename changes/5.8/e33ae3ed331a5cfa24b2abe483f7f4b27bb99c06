kbuild: use $(CC_VERSION_TEXT) to evaluate CC_IS_GCC and CC_IS_CLANG

The result of '$(CC) --version | head -n 1' has already been computed
by the top Makefile, and stored in the environment variable,
CC_VERSION_TEXT.

'echo' is cheaper than the two commands $(CC) and 'head' although this
optimization is not noticeable level.
