mm/gup: move __get_user_pages_fast() down a few lines in gup.c

Patch series "mm/gup, drm/i915: refactor gup_fast, convert to pin_user_pages()", v2.

In order to convert the drm/i915 driver from get_user_pages() to
pin_user_pages(), a FOLL_PIN equivalent of __get_user_pages_fast() was
required.  That led to refactoring __get_user_pages_fast(), with the
following goals:

1) As above: provide a pin_user_pages*() routine for drm/i915 to call,
   in place of __get_user_pages_fast(),

2) Get rid of the gup.c duplicate code for walking page tables with
   interrupts disabled. This duplicate code is a minor maintenance
   problem anyway.

3) Make it easy for an upcoming patch from Souptick, which aims to
   convert __get_user_pages_fast() to use a gup_flags argument, instead
   of a bool writeable arg.  Also, if this series looks good, we can
   ask Souptick to change the name as well, to whatever the consensus
   is. My initial recommendation is: get_user_pages_fast_only(), to
   match the new pin_user_pages_only().

This patch (of 4):

This is in order to avoid a forward declaration of
internal_get_user_pages_fast(), in the next patch.

This is code movement only--all generated code should be identical.
