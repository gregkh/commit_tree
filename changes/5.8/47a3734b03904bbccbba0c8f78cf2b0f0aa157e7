gpio: max730x: bring gpiochip_add_data after port config

gpiochip_add_data being called before might cause premature calls of
the gpiochip operations before the port_config values are initialized,
which would possibily write zeros to port configuration registers,
an operation not allowed. For example, if there are gpio-hog nodes
in a device-tree, the sequence of function calls are performed

gpiochip_add_data
of_gpiochip_add
of_gpiochip_scan_gpios
of_gpiochip_add_hog
gpiod_hog
gpiochip_request_own_desc
gpiod_configure_flags
gpiod_direction_output/gpiod_direction_input

which would call later the gpiochip operation direction_output or
direction_input prior the port_config[] initialization.

Moreover, gpiochip_get_data is replaced by the container_of macro
inside the gpiochip operations, which would allow the calling of
max7301_direction_input prior to gpiochip_add_data
