ALSA: hda: fix NULL pointer dereference during suspend

When the ASoC card registration fails and the codec component driver
never probes, the codec device is not initialized and therefore
memory for codec->wcaps is not allocated. This results in a NULL pointer
dereference when the codec driver suspend callback is invoked during
system suspend. Fix this by returning without performing any actions
during codec suspend/resume if the card was not registered successfully.
