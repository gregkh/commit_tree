perf intel-pt: Fix recording PEBS-via-PT with registers

When recording PEBS-via-PT, the kernel will not accept the intel_pt
event with register sampling e.g.

 # perf record --kcore -c 10000 -e '{intel_pt/branch=0/,branch-loads/aux-output/ppp}' -I -- ls -l
 Error:
 intel_pt/branch=0/: PMU Hardware doesn't support sampling/overflow-interrupts. Try 'perf stat'

Fix by suppressing register sampling on the intel_pt evsel.

Committer notes:

Adrian informed that this is only available from Tremont onwards, so on
older processors the error continues the same as before.
