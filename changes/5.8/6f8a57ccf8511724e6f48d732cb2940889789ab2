bpf: Make verifier log more relevant by default

To make BPF verifier verbose log more releavant and easier to use to debug
verification failures, "pop" parts of log that were successfully verified.
This has effect of leaving only verifier logs that correspond to code branches
that lead to verification failure, which in practice should result in much
shorter and more relevant verifier log dumps. This behavior is made the
default behavior and can be overriden to do exhaustive logging by specifying
BPF_LOG_LEVEL2 log level.

Using BPF_LOG_LEVEL2 to disable this behavior is not ideal, because in some
cases it's good to have BPF_LOG_LEVEL2 per-instruction register dump
verbosity, but still have only relevant verifier branches logged. But for this
patch, I didn't want to add any new flags. It might be worth-while to just
rethink how BPF verifier logging is performed and requested and streamline it
a bit. But this trimming of successfully verified branches seems to be useful
and a good default behavior.

To test this, I modified runqslower slightly to introduce read of
uninitialized stack variable. Log (**truncated in the middle** to save many
lines out of this commit message) BEFORE this change:

Notice how there is a successful code path from instruction 0 through 67, few
successfully verified jumps (44->66, 34->66), and only after that 11->28 jump
plus error on instruction #32.

; if (!pid || (targ_pid && targ_pid != pid))
11: (15) if r1 == 0x0 goto pc+16

from 11 to 28: R1_w=inv0 R2_w=inv0 R6_w=ctx(id=0,off=0,imm=0) R10=fp0 fp-8=mmmm???? fp-24_w=00000000 fp-32_w=00000000 fp-40_w=00000000 fp-48_w=00000000

Notice how in this case, there are 0-11 instructions + jump from 11 to
28 is recorded + 28-32 instructions with error on insn #32.

test_verifier test runner was updated to specify BPF_LOG_LEVEL2 for
VERBOSE_ACCEPT expected result due to potentially "incomplete" success verbose
log at BPF_LOG_LEVEL1.

On success, verbose log will only have a summary of number of processed
instructions, etc, but no branch tracing log. Having just a last succesful
branch tracing seemed weird and confusing. Having small and clean summary log
in success case seems quite logical and nice, though.
