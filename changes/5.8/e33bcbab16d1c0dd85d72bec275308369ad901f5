tee: add support for session's client UUID generation

TEE Client API defines that from user space only information needed for
specified login operations is group identifier for group based logins.

REE kernel is expected to formulate trustworthy client UUID and pass that
to TEE environment. REE kernel is required to verify that provided group
identifier for group based logins matches calling processes group
memberships.

TEE specification only defines that the information passed from REE
environment to TEE environment is encoded into on UUID.

In order to guarantee trustworthiness of client UUID user space is not
allowed to freely pass client UUID.

UUIDv5 form is used encode variable amount of information needed for
different login types.
