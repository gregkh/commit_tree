s390/cpum_cf,perf: change DFLT_CCERROR counter name

Change the counter name DLFT_CCERROR to DLFT_CCFINISH on IBM z15.
This counter counts completed DEFLATE instructions with exit code
0, 1 or 2. Since exit code 0 means success and exit code 1 or 2
indicate errors, change the counter name to avoid confusion.
This counter is incremented each time the DEFLATE instruction
completed regardless if an error was detected or not.
