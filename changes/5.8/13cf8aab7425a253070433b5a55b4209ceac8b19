qed: Populate nvm-file attributes while reading nvm config partition.

NVM config file address will be modified when the MBI image is upgraded.
Driver would return stale config values if user reads the nvm-config
(via ethtool -d) in this state. The fix is to re-populate nvm attribute
info while reading the nvm config values/partition.
