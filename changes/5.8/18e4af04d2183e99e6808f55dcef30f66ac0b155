drm/i915: Drop no-semaphore boosting

Now that we have fast timeslicing on semaphores, we no longer need to
prioritise none-semaphore work as we will yield any work blocked on a
semaphore to the next in the queue. Previously with no timeslicing,
blocking on the semaphore caused extremely bad scheduling with multiple
clients utilising multiple rings. Now, there is no impact and we can
remove the complication.
