IB/{rdmavt, hfi1}: Implement creation of accelerated UD QPs

Adds capability to create a qpn to be recognized as an accelerated
UD QP for ipoib.

This is accomplished by reserving 0x81 in byte[0] of the qpn as the
prefix for these qp types and reserving qpns between 0x810000 and
0x81ffff.

The hfi1 capability mask already contained a flag for the VNIC netdev.
This has been renamed and extended to include both VNIC and ipoib.

The rvt code to allocate qps now recognizes this flag and sets 0x81
into byte[0] of the qpn.

The code to allocate qpns is modified to reset the qpn numbering when it
is detected that a value is located in byte[0] for a UD QP and it is a
qpn being requested for net dev use. If it is a regular UD QP then it is
allowable to have bits set in byte[0] of the qpn and provide the
previously normal behavior.

The code to free the qpn now checks for the AIP prefix value of 0x81 and
removes it from the qpn before being freed so that the lower 16 bit
number can be reused.

This patch requires minor changes in the IB core and ipoib to facilitate
the creation of accelerated UP QPs.
