mm: swap: memcg: fix memcg stats for huge pages

The commit 2262185c5b28 ("mm: per-cgroup memory reclaim stats") added
PGLAZYFREE, PGACTIVATE & PGDEACTIVATE stats for cgroups but missed
couple of places and PGLAZYFREE missed huge page handling. Fix that.
Also for PGLAZYFREE use the irq-unsafe function to update as the irq is
already disabled.
