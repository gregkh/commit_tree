drm/i915: Avoid using rq->engine after free during i915_fence_release

In order to be valid to dereference during the i915_fence_release, after
retiring the fence and releasing its refererences, we assume that
rq->engine can only be a real engine (that stay intact until the device
is shutdown after all fences have been flushed). However, due to a quirk
of preempt-to-busy, we may retire a request that still belongs to a
virtual engine and so eventually free it with rq->engine being invalid.
To avoid dereferencing that invalid engine, we look at the
execution_mask which if it indicates it may be executed on more than one
engine, we know it originated on a virtual engine and may still be on
one.
