KVM: x86: Export kvm_propagate_fault() (as kvm_inject_emulated_page_fault)

Export the page fault propagation helper so that VMX can use it to
correctly emulate TLB invalidation on page faults in an upcoming patch.

In the (hopefully) not-too-distant future, SGX virtualization will also
want access to the helper for injecting page faults to the correct level
(L1 vs. L2) when emulating ENCLS instructions.

Rename the function to kvm_inject_emulated_page_fault() to clarify that
it is (a) injecting a fault and (b) only for page faults.  WARN if it's
invoked with an exception other than PF_VECTOR.
