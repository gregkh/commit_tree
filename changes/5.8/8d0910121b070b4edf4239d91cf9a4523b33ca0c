gpio: Make "offset" and "unsigned int", not just "unsigned"

When I copied the function prototypes from the GPIO header file into
my own driver, checkpatch yelled at me saying that I shouldn't use use
"unsigned" but instead should say "unsigned int".  Let's make the
header file use "unsigned int" so others who copy like I did won't get
yelled at.
