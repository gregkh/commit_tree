xfs: force writes to delalloc regions to unwritten

When writing to a delalloc region in the data fork, commit the new
allocations (of the da reservation) as unwritten so that the mappings
are only marked written once writeback completes successfully.  This
fixes the problem of stale data exposure if the system goes down during
targeted writeback of a specific region of a file, as tested by
generic/042.
