KVM: VMX: Handle INVVPID fallback logic in vpid_sync_vcpu_addr()

Directly invoke vpid_sync_context() to do a global INVVPID when the
individual address variant is not supported instead of deferring such
behavior to the caller.  This allows for additional consolidation of
code as the logic is basically identical to the emulation of the
individual address variant in handle_invvpid().

No functional change intended.
