net: lan78xx: add missing endpoint sanity check

Add the missing endpoint sanity check to prevent a NULL-pointer
dereference should a malicious device lack the expected endpoints.

Note that the driver has a broken endpoint-lookup helper,
lan78xx_get_endpoints(), which can end up accepting interfaces in an
altsetting without endpoints as long as *some* altsetting has a bulk-in
and a bulk-out endpoint.
