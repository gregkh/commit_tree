habanalabs: handle the h/w sync object

Define a structure representing the h/w sync object (SOB).

a SOB can contain up to 2^15 values. Each signal CS will increment the SOB
by 1, so after some time we will reach the maximum number the SOB can
represent. When that happens, the driver needs to move to a different SOB
for the signal operation.

A SOB can be in 1 of 4 states:

1. Working state with value < 2^15

2. We reached a value of 2^15, but the signal operations weren't completed
yet OR there are pending waits on this signal. For the next submission, the
driver will move to another SOB.

3. ALL the signal operations on the SOB have finished AND there are no more
pending waits on the SOB AND we reached a value of 2^15 (This basically
means the refcnt of the SOB is 0 - see explanation below). When that
happens, the driver can clear the SOB by simply doing WREG32 0 to it and
set the refcnt back to 1.

4. The SOB is cleared and can be used next time by the driver when it needs
to reuse an SOB.

Per SOB, the driver will maintain a single refcnt, that will be initialized
to 1. When a signal or wait operation on this SOB is submitted to the PQ,
the refcnt will be incremented. When a signal or wait operation on this SOB
completes, the refcnt will be decremented. After the submission of the
signal operation that increments the SOB to a value of 2^15, the refcnt is
also decremented.
