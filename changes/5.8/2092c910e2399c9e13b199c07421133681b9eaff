batman-adv: Revert "Drop lockdep.h include for soft-interface.c"

The commit 1a33e10e4a95 ("net: partially revert dynamic lockdep key
changes") reverts the commit ab92d68fc22f ("net: core: add generic lockdep
keys"). But it forgot to also revert the commit 5759af0682b3 ("batman-adv:
Drop lockdep.h include for soft-interface.c") which depends on the latter.
