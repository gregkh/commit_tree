powerpc/xmon: Move insertion of breakpoint for xol'ing

When a new breakpoint is created, the second instruction of that
breakpoint is patched with a trap instruction. This assumes the length
of the instruction is always the same. In preparation for prefixed
instructions, remove this assumption. Insert the trap instruction at the
same time the first instruction is inserted.
