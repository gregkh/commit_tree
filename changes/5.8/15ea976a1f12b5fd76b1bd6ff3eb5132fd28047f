staging: rtl8712: Fix IEEE80211_ADDBA_PARAM_BUF_SIZE_MASK

The value in shared headers was fixed 9 years ago in commit 8d661f1e462d
("ieee80211: correct IEEE80211_ADDBA_PARAM_BUF_SIZE_MASK macro") and
while looking at using shared headers for other duplicated constants
I noticed this driver uses the old value.

The macros are also defined twice in this file so I am deleting the
second definition.
