qed: add missing error test for DBG_STATUS_NO_MATCHING_FRAMING_MODE

The error DBG_STATUS_NO_MATCHING_FRAMING_MODE was added to the enum
enum dbg_status however there is a missing corresponding entry for
this in the array s_status_str. This causes an out-of-bounds read when
indexing into the last entry of s_status_str.  Fix this by adding in
the missing entry.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Out-of-bounds read").
Fixes: 2d22bc8354b1 ("qed: FW 8.42.2.0 debug features")
