dt-bindings: display: xpp055c272: Remove the reg property

Commit 52120e8c7ae3 ("dt-bindings: display: fix panel warnings") removed
the dsi unit name, but missed to remove the 'reg' property, which causes
the following 'make dt_binding_check' warning:

Documentation/devicetree/bindings/display/panel/xinpeng,xpp055c272.example.dts:17.5-29.11: Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): /example-0/dsi: node has a reg or ranges property, but no unit name

Fix it by removing the unneeded 'reg' property.
