bpf: Fix map leak in HASH_OF_MAPS map

Fix HASH_OF_MAPS bug of not putting inner map pointer on bpf_map_elem_update()
operation. This is due to per-cpu extra_elems optimization, which bypassed
free_htab_elem() logic doing proper clean ups. Make sure that inner map is put
properly in optimized case as well.
