arm64: sve: Fix build failure when ARM64_SVE=y and SYSCTL=n

When I squashed the 'allnoconfig' compiler warning about the
set_sve_default_vl() function being defined but not used in commit
1e570f512cbd ("arm64/sve: Eliminate data races on sve_default_vl"), I
accidentally broke the build for configs where ARM64_SVE is enabled, but
SYSCTL is not.

Fix this by only compiling the SVE sysctl support if both CONFIG_SVE=y
and CONFIG_SYSCTL=y.
