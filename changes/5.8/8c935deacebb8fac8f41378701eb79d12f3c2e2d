usb: dwc2: gadget: move gadget resume after the core is in L0 state

When the remote wakeup interrupt is triggered, lx_state is resumed from L2
to L0 state. But when the gadget resume is called, lx_state is still L2.
This prevents the resume callback to queue any request. Any attempt
to queue a request from resume callback will result in:
- "submit request only in active state" debug message to be issued
- dwc2_hsotg_ep_queue() returns -EAGAIN

Call the gadget resume routine after the core is in L0 state.
