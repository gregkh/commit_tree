arm64: Drop unnecessary include from asm/smp.h

asm/pointer_auth.h is not needed anymore in asm/smp.h, as 62a679cb2825
("arm64: simplify ptrauth initialization") removed the keys from the
secondary_data structure.

This also cures a compilation issue introduced by f227e3ec3b5c
("random32: update the net random state on interrupt and activity").

Fixes: 62a679cb2825 ("arm64: simplify ptrauth initialization")
Fixes: f227e3ec3b5c ("random32: update the net random state on interrupt and activity")
