habanalabs: don't set default fence_ops->wait

It's the default.

Also so much for "we're not going to tell the graphics people how to
review their code", dma_fence is a pretty core piece of gpu driver
infrastructure. And it's very much uapi relevant, including piles of
corresponding userspace protocols and libraries for how to pass these
around.

Would be great if habanalabs would not use this (from a quick look
it's not needed at all), since open source the userspace and playing
by the usual rules isn't on the table. If that's not possible (because
it's actually using the uapi part of dma_fence to interact with gpu
drivers) then we have exactly what everyone promised we'd want to
avoid.
