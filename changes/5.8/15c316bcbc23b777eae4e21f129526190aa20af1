efi/libstub: Get the exact UTF-8 length

efi_convert_cmdline currently overestimates the length of the equivalent
UTF-8 encoding.

snprintf can now be used to do the conversion to UTF-8, however, it does
not have a way to specify the size of the UTF-16 string, only the size
of the resulting UTF-8 string. So in order to use it, we need to
precalculate the exact UTF-8 size.
