powerpc/papr_scm: Implement support for PAPR_PDSM_HEALTH

This patch implements support for PDSM request 'PAPR_PDSM_HEALTH'
that returns a newly introduced 'struct nd_papr_pdsm_health' instance
containing dimm health information back to user space in response to
ND_CMD_CALL. This functionality is implemented in newly introduced
papr_pdsm_health() that queries the nvdimm health information and
then copies this information to the package payload whose layout is
defined by 'struct nd_papr_pdsm_health'.
