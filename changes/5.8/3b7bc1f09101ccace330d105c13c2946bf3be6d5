net: dsa: introduce a dsa_switch_find function

Somewhat similar to dsa_tree_find, dsa_switch_find returns a dsa_switch
structure pointer by searching for its tree index and switch index (the
parameters from dsa,member). To be used, for example, by drivers who
implement .crosschip_bridge_join and need a reference to the other
switch indicated to by the tree_index and sw_index arguments.
