drm/amd/display: Convert memory from cpu to fw endianness correctly

[Why]
Current code does not guarantee the correct endianness of memory being
copied to fw, specifically in the case where cpu isn't little endian.

[How]
Windows and Diags are always little endian, so we define a macro that
does nothing. Linux already defines this macro and will do the correct
endianness conversion.
