regmap: fix alignment issue

The assembly and disassembly of data to be sent to or received from
a device invoke functions regmap_format_XX() and regmap_parse_XX()
that extract or insert data items from or into a buffer, using
assignments. In some cases the functions are called with a buffer
pointer with an odd address. On architectures with strict alignment
requirements this can result in a kernel crash. The assignments
have been replaced by functions that take alignment into account.
