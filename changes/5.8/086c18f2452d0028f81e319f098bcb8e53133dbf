ionic: centralize queue reset code

The queue reset pattern is used in a couple different places,
only slightly different from each other, and could cause
issues if one gets changed and the other didn't.  This puts
them together so that only one version is needed, yet each
can have slighty different effects by passing in a pointer
to a work function to do whatever configuration twiddling is
needed in the middle of the reset.

This specifically addresses issues seen where under loops
of changing ring size or queue count parameters we could
occasionally bump into the netdev watchdog.
