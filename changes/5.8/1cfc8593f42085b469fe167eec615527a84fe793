media: atomisp: Get rid of struct pci_dev in struct atomisp_device

struct atomisp device has struct device and struct pci_dev pointers
which are basically duplicates of each other. Drop the latter
in favour of the former.

While here, unify pdev to be pointer to struct pci_device and reindent
some (touched) lines for better readability.
