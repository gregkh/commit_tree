tools, bpftool: Minor fixes for documentation

Bring minor improvements to bpftool documentation. Fix or harmonise
formatting, update map types (including in interactive help), improve
description for "map create", fix a build warning due to a missing line
after the double-colon for the "bpftool prog profile" example,
complete/harmonise/sort the list of related bpftool man pages in
footers.

v2:
- Remove (instead of changing) mark-up on "value" in bpftool-map.rst,
  when it does not refer to something passed on the command line.
- Fix an additional typo ("hexadeximal") in the same file.
