gpio: pca953x: Override IRQ for one of the expanders on Galileo Gen 2

ACPI table on Intel Galileo Gen 2 has wrong pin number for IRQ resource
of one of the IÂ²C GPIO expanders. Since we know what that number is and
luckily have GPIO bases fixed for SoC's controllers, we may use a simple
DMI quirk to match the platform and retrieve GpioInt() pin on it for
the expander in question.

Mika suggested the way to avoid a quirk in the GPIO ACPI library and
here is the second, almost rewritten version of it.

Fixes: f32517bf1ae0 ("gpio: pca953x: support ACPI devices found on Galileo Gen2")
Depends-on: 25e3ef894eef ("gpio: acpi: Split out acpi_gpio_get_irq_resource() helper")
