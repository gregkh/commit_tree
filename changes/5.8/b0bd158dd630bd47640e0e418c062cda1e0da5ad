loop: Refactor loop_set_status() size calculation

figure_loop_size() calculates the loop size based on the passed in
parameters, but at the same time it updates the offset and sizelimit
parameters in the loop device configuration. That is a somewhat
unexpected side effect of a function with this name, and it is only only
needed by one of the two callers of this function - loop_set_status().

Move the lo_offset and lo_sizelimit assignment back into loop_set_status(),
and use the newly factored out functions to validate and apply the newly
calculated size. This allows us to get rid of figure_loop_size() in a
follow-up commit.
