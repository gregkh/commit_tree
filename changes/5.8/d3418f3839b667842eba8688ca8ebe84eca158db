arm64: vdso: use consistent 'abi' nomenclature

The current code doesn't use a consistent naming scheme for structures,
enums, or variables, making it harder than necessary to determine the
relationship between these.

Let's make this easier by consistently using 'vdso_abi' nomenclature.
The 'vdso_lookup' array is renamed to 'vdso_info' to describe what it
contains rather than how it is consumed.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
