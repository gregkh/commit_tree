libbpf: Fix CO-RE relocs against .text section

bpf_object__find_program_by_title(), used by CO-RE relocation code, doesn't
return .text "BPF program", if it is a function storage for sub-programs.
Because of that, any CO-RE relocation in helper non-inlined functions will
fail. Fix this by searching for .text-corresponding BPF program manually.

Adjust one of bpf_iter selftest to exhibit this pattern.
