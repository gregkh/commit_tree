khugepaged: do not stop collapse if less than half PTEs are referenced

__collapse_huge_page_swapin() checks the number of referenced PTE to
decide if the memory range is hot enough to justify swapin.

We have few problems with the approach:

 - It is way too late: we can do the check much earlier and safe time.
   khugepaged_scan_pmd() already knows if we have any pages to swap in
   and number of referenced page.

 - It stops collapse altogether if there's not enough referenced pages,
   not only swappingin.

Fix it by making the right check early. We also can avoid additional
page table scanning if khugepaged_scan_pmd() haven't found any swap
entries.
