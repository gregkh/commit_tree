drm/amd/display: Unify psr feature flags

[Why]
As it stands, psr has feature flags in dm, stream, and link. Most are
not defined well enough, and different dm layers have different uses for
these same flags.

[How]
We define a new structure called psr_settings in dc_link that will hold
the following psr feature flags:

psr_feature_enable - psr is supported
psr_allow_active - psr is currently active
psr_version - internal psr version supported
psr_frame_capture_indication_req
psr_sdp_transmit_line_num_deadline
The last two flags were moved out of the power module
for the purposes of consolidating psr flags.
Their use is already well-defined.

Psr caps reported by sink will also be stored in dc_link,
in dpcd_caps.psr_caps.
