bpf: Add comments to interpret bpf_prog return values

Add a short comment in bpf_iter_run_prog() function to
explain how bpf_prog return value is converted to
seq_ops->show() return value:
  bpf_prog return           seq_ops()->show() return
     0                         0
     1                         -EAGAIN

When show() return value is -EAGAIN, the current
bpf_seq_read() will end. If the current seq_file buffer
is empty, -EAGAIN will return to user space. Otherwise,
the buffer will be copied to user space.
In both cases, the next bpf_seq_read() call will
try to show the same object which returned -EAGAIN
previously.
