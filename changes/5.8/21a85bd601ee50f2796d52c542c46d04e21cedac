scripts: Require pahole v1.16 when generating BTF

bpf_iter requires the kernel BTF to be generated with
pahole >= 1.16, since otherwise the function definitions
that the iterator attaches to are not included.
This failure mode is indistiguishable from trying to attach
to an iterator that really doesn't exist.

Since it's really easy to miss this requirement, bump the
pahole version check used at build time to at least 1.16.
