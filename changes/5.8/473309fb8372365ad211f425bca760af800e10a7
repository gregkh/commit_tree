net: dp83640: fix SIOCSHWTSTAMP to update the struct with actual configuration

From Documentation/networking/timestamping.txt:

  A driver which supports hardware time stamping shall update the
  struct with the actual, possibly more permissive configuration.

Do update the struct passed when we upscale the requested time
stamping mode.
