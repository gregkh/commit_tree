arm64: dts: mt8183: adjust cpuidle target residency

Split a cluster level cpuidle state into two, so mt8183 variant
boards can adjust parameters for each cluster, and reduce cluster0's
default target residency to 1000us as power measurements showed that
its minimum residency is slightly less than cluster1's 1300us.
