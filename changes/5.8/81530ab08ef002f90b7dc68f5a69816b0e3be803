RDMA/mlx5: Allow providing extra scatter CQE QP flag

Scatter CQE feature relies on two flags MLX5_QP_FLAG_SCATTER_CQE and
MLX5_QP_FLAG_ALLOW_SCATTER_CQE, both of them can be provided without
relation to device capability.

Relax global validity check to allow MLX5_QP_FLAG_ALLOW_SCATTER_CQE QP
flag.

Existing user applications are failing on this new validity check.

Fixes: 90ecb37a751b ("RDMA/mlx5: Change scatter CQE flag to be set like other vendor flags")
Fixes: 37518fa49f76 ("RDMA/mlx5: Process all vendor flags in one place")
