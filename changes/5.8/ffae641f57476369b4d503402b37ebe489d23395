x86/entry/64/compat: Fix Xen PV SYSENTER frame setup

The SYSENTER frame setup was nonsense.  It worked by accident because the
normal code into which the Xen asm jumped (entry_SYSENTER_32/compat) threw
away SP without touching the stack.  entry_SYSENTER_compat was recently
modified such that it relied on having a valid stack pointer, so now the
Xen asm needs to invoke it with a valid stack.

Fix it up like SYSCALL: use the Xen-provided frame and skip the bare
metal prologue.
