nvme-pci: prevent SK hynix PC400 from using Write Zeroes command

After commit 6e02318eaea5 ("nvme: add support for the Write Zeroes
command"), SK hynix PC400 becomes very slow with the following error
message:

[  224.567695] blk_update_request: operation not supported error, dev nvme1n1, sector 499384320 op 0x9:(WRITE_ZEROES) flags 0x1000000 phys_seg 0 prio class 0]

SK Hynix PC400 has a buggy firmware that treats NLB as max value instead
of a range, so the NLB passed isn't a valid value to the firmware.

According to SK hynix there are three commands are affected:
- Write Zeroes
- Compare
- Write Uncorrectable

Right now only Write Zeroes is implemented, so disable it completely on
SK hynix PC400.
