staging: rtl8192u: Merge almost duplicate code

This causes a change in behaviour:
- stats also get updated when reordering, this seems like it should be
  the case but those lines were commented out.
- sub_skb NULL check now happens early in both cases, previously it
  happened only after dereferencing it 12 times, so it may not actually
  be needed.
