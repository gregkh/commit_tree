mtd: rawnand: xway: Fix build issue

This MIPS driver does not support COMPILE_TEST yet and failed to build
under my radar.

Replace 'mtd' chich is not defined in the scope of xway_nand_remove()
by nand_to_mtd(chip). The mistake has been added in the long series
dropping nand_release().

Tested with a 7.3.0 MIPS GCC toolchain built with Buildroot.
