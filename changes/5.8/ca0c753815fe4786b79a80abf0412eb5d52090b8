bnxt_en: Init ethtool link settings after reading updated PHY configuration.

In a shared port PHY configuration, async event is received when any of the
port modifies the configuration. Ethtool link settings should be
initialised after updated PHY configuration from firmware.

Fixes: b1613e78e98d ("bnxt_en: Add async. event logic for PHY configuration changes.")
