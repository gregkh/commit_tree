net/mlx5: E-switch, Destroy TSAR after reload interface

When eswitch offloads is enabled, TSAR is created before reloading
the interfaces.
However when eswitch offloads mode is disabled, TSAR is disabled before
reloading the interfaces.

To keep the eswitch enable/disable sequence as mirror, destroy TSAR
after reloading the interfaces.
