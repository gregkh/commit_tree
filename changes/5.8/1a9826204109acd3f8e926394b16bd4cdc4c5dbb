scsi: iscsi: Change iSCSI workqueue max_active back to 1

Commit 3ce419662dd4 ("scsi: iscsi: Register sysfs for iscsi workqueue")
enabled 'cpumask' support for iSCSI workqueues. However, it is unnecessary
to set max_active = 2 since 'cpumask' can still be modified when max_active
is 1.

This patch sets max_active to 1 so as to keep the same behaviour as before.
