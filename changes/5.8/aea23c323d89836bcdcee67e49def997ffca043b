ipv6: Fix use of anycast address with loopback

Thomas reported a regression with IPv6 and anycast using the following
reproducer:

    echo 1 >  /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/all/forwarding
    ip -6 a add fc12::1/16 dev lo
    sleep 2
    echo "pinging lo"
    ping6 -c 2 fc12::

The conversion of addrconf_f6i_alloc to use ip6_route_info_create missed
the use of fib6_is_reject which checks addresses added to the loopback
interface and sets the REJECT flag as needed. Update fib6_is_reject for
loopback checks to handle RTF_ANYCAST addresses.

Fixes: c7a1ce397ada ("ipv6: Change addrconf_f6i_alloc to use ip6_route_info_create")
