drm/i915/gem: Implement legacy MI_STORE_DATA_IMM

The older arches did not convert MI_STORE_DATA_IMM to using the GTT, but
left them writing to a physical address. The notes suggest that the
primary reason would be so that the writes were cache coherent, as the
CPU cache uses physical tagging. As such we did not implement the
legacy variant of MI_STORE_DATA_IMM and so left all the relocations
synchronous -- but with a small function to convert from the vma address
into the physical address, we can implement asynchronous relocs on these
older arches, fixing up a few tests that require them.

In order to be able to test the legacy paths, refactor the gpu
relocations so that we can hook them up to a selftest.

v2: Use an array of offsets not enum labels for the selftest
v3: Refactor the common igt_hexdump()
