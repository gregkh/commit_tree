drm/amdgpu: request reg_val_offs each kiq read reg

According to the current kiq read register method,
there will be race condition when using KIQ to read
register if multiple clients want to read at same time
just like the expample below:
1. client-A start to read REG-0 throguh KIQ
2. client-A poll the seqno-0
3. client-B start to read REG-1 through KIQ
4. client-B poll the seqno-1
5. the kiq complete these two read operation
6. client-A to read the register at the wb buffer and
   get REG-1 value

Therefore, use amdgpu_device_wb_get() to request reg_val_offs
for each kiq read register.

v2: fix the error remove
v3: fix the print typo
