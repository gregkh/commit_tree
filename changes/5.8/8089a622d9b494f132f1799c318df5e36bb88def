dt-bindings: display: allow port and ports in panel-lvds

Both port and ports names may be used in a panel-lvds binding
  port - for a single port
  ports - if there is more than one port in sub-nodes

Fixes the following warning:
advantech,idk-2121wr.example.dt.yaml: panel-lvds: 'port' is a required property

advantech,idk-2121wr.yaml needs several ports, so uses a ports node.

v2:
  - Use oneOf - makes the logic more obvious (Rob)
  - Added Fixes tag
  - Added port: true, ports:true

v3:
  - Indent port/ports in required two spaces (Rob)
