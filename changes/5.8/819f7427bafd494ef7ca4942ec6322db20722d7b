RDMA/mlx5: Add init2init as a modify command

Missing INIT2INIT entry in the list of modify commands caused DEVX
applications to be unable to modify_qp for this transition state. Add the
MLX5_CMD_OP_INIT2INIT_QP opcode to the list of allowed DEVX opcodes.

Fixes: e662e14d801b ("IB/mlx5: Add DEVX support for modify and query commands")
