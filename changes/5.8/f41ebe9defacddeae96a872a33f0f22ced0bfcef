perf probe: Do not show the skipped events

When a probe point is expanded to several places (like inlined) and if
some of them are skipped because of blacklisted or __init function,
those trace_events has no event name. It must be skipped while showing
results.

Without this fix, you can see "(null):(null)" on the list,

  # ./perf probe request_resource
  reserve_setup is out of .text, skip it.
  Added new events:
    (null):(null)        (on request_resource)
    probe:request_resource (on request_resource)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe:request_resource -aR sleep 1

  #

With this fix, it is ignored:

  # ./perf probe request_resource
  reserve_setup is out of .text, skip it.
  Added new events:
    probe:request_resource (on request_resource)

  You can now use it in all perf tools, such as:

  	perf record -e probe:request_resource -aR sleep 1
