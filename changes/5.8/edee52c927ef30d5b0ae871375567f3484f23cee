drm/i915/gt: Delay release of engine-pm after last retirement

Keep the engine-pm awake until the next jiffie, to avoid immediate
ping-pong under moderate load. (Forcing the idle barrier excerbates the
moderate load, dramatically increasing the driver overhead.) On the
other hand, delaying the idle-barrier slightly incurs longer rc6-off
and so more power consumption.
