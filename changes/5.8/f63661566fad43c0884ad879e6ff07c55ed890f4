mm/page_alloc.c: clear out zone->lowmem_reserve[] if the zone is empty

When requesting memory allocation from a specific zone is not satisfied,
it will fall to lower zone to try allocating memory.  In this case, lower
zone's ->lowmem_reserve[] will help protect its own memory resource.  The
higher the relevant ->lowmem_reserve[] is, the harder the upper zone can
get memory from this lower zone.

However, this protection mechanism should be applied to populated zone,
but not an empty zone. So filling ->lowmem_reserve[] for empty zone is
not necessary, and may mislead people that it's valid data in that zone.
