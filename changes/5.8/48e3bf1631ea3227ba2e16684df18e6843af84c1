scsi: scsi_debug: Bump to version 1.89

The scsi_debug driver version is visible in:

   /sys/modules/scsi_debug/version

and can thus be used by user space programs to alter the features they try
to use. Since the per_host_store and zbc/zone options are significant
additions, bump the version number to 1.89 .
