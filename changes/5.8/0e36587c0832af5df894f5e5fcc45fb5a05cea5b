arm64: dts: renesas: r8a774c0-cat874: Add support for AISTARVISION MIPI Adapter V2.1

This patch adds support for AISTARVISION MIPI Adapter V2.1 board connected
to G2E board. Common file aistarvision-mipi-adapter-2.1.dtsi is created
which have the camera endpoint nodes for imx219 and ov5645 so that this can
be re-used with other G2x platforms.

r8a774c0-ek874-mipi-2.1.dts file enables the required VIN/CSI nodes and by
default ties ov5645 camera endpoint to CSI2.
