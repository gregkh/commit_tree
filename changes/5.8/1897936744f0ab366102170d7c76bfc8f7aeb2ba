netdevsim: Register control traps

Register two control traps with devlink. The existing selftest at
tools/testing/selftests/drivers/net/netdevsim/devlink_trap.sh iterates
over all registered traps and checks that the action of non-drop traps
cannot be changed. Up until now only exception traps were tested, now
control traps will be tested as well.
