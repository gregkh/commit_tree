ice: report netlist version in .info_get

The flash memory for the ice hardware contains a block of information
used for link management called the Netlist module.

As this essentially represents another section of firmware, add its
version information to the output of the driver's .info_get handler.

This includes both a version and the first few bytes of a hash of the
module contents.

  fw.netlist -> the version information extracted from the netlist module
  fw.netlist.build-> first 4 bytes of the hash of the contents, similar
                     to fw.mgmt.build
