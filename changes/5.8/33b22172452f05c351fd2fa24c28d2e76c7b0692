KVM: x86: move nested-related kvm_x86_ops to a separate struct

Clean up some of the patching of kvm_x86_ops, by moving kvm_x86_ops related to
nested virtualization into a separate struct.

As a result, these ops will always be non-NULL on VMX.  This is not a problem:

* check_nested_events is only called if is_guest_mode(vcpu) returns true

* get_nested_state treats VMXOFF state the same as nested being disabled

* set_nested_state fails if you attempt to set nested state while
  nesting is disabled

* nested_enable_evmcs could already be called on a CPU without VMX enabled
  in CPUID.

* nested_get_evmcs_version was fixed in the previous patch
