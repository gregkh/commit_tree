selinux: don't produce incorrect filename_trans_count

I thought I fixed the counting in filename_trans_read_helper() to count
the compat rule count correctly in the final version, but it's still
wrong. To really count the same thing as in the compat path, we'd need
to add up the cardinalities of stype bitmaps of all datums.

Since the kernel currently doesn't implement an ebitmap_cardinality()
function (and computing the proper count would just waste CPU cycles
anyway), just document that we use the field only in case of the old
format and stop updating it in filename_trans_read_helper().
