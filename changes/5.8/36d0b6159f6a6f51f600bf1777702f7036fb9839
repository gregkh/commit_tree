selftests/bpf: Disable ASAN instrumentation for mmap()'ed memory read

AddressSanitizer assumes that all memory dereferences are done against memory
allocated by sanitizer's malloc()/free() code and not touched by anyone else.
Seems like this doesn't hold for perf buffer memory. Disable instrumentation
on perf buffer callback function.
