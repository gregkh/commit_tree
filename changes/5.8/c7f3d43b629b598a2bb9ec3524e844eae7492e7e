clocksource: Remove obsolete ifdef

CONFIG_GENERIC_VDSO_CLOCK_MODE was a transitional config switch which got
removed after all architectures got converted to the new storage model.

But the removal forgot to remove the #ifdef which guards the
vdso_clock_mode sanity check, which effectively disables the sanity check.

Remove it now.
