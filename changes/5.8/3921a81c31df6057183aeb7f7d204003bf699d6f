net: ena: xdp: update napi budget for DROP and ABORTED

This patch fixes two issues with XDP:

1. If the XDP verdict is XDP_ABORTED we break the loop, which results in
   us handling one buffer per napi cycle instead of the total budget
   (usually 64). To overcome this simply change the xdp_verdict check to
   != XDP_PASS. When the verdict is XDP_PASS, the skb is not expected to
   be NULL.

2. Update the residual budget for XDP_DROP and XDP_ABORTED, since
   packets are handled in these cases.
