workqueue: Convert the pool::lock and wq_mayday_lock to raw_spinlock_t

The workqueue code has it's internal spinlocks (pool::lock), which
are acquired on most workqueue operations. These spinlocks are
converted to 'sleeping' spinlocks on a RT-kernel.

Workqueue functions can be invoked from contexts which are truly atomic
even on a PREEMPT_RT enabled kernel. Taking sleeping locks from such
contexts is forbidden.

The pool::lock hold times are bound and the code sections are
relatively short, which allows to convert pool::lock and as a
consequence wq_mayday_lock to raw spinlocks which are truly spinning
locks even on a PREEMPT_RT kernel.

With the previous conversion of the manager waitqueue to a simple
waitqueue workqueues are now fully RT compliant.
