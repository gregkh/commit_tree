bpf: Add csum_level helper for fixing up csum levels

Add a bpf_csum_level() helper which BPF programs can use in combination
with bpf_skb_adjust_room() when they pass in BPF_F_ADJ_ROOM_NO_CSUM_RESET
flag to the latter to avoid falling back to CHECKSUM_NONE.

The bpf_csum_level() allows to adjust CHECKSUM_UNNECESSARY skb->csum_levels
via BPF_CSUM_LEVEL_{INC,DEC} which calls __skb_{incr,decr}_checksum_unnecessary()
on the skb. The helper also allows a BPF_CSUM_LEVEL_RESET which sets the skb's
csum to CHECKSUM_NONE as well as a BPF_CSUM_LEVEL_QUERY to just return the
current level. Without this helper, there is no way to otherwise adjust the
skb->csum_level. I did not add an extra dummy flags as there is plenty of free
bitspace in level argument itself iff ever needed in future.
