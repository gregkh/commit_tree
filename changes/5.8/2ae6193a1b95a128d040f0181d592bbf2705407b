ARM: dts: ux500: samsung-golden: Add proximity sensor

samsung-golden has the same sharp,gp2ap002s00f proximity sensor
that is also used in samsung-skomer.

A driver was added for it in
commit 97d642e23037 ("iio: light: Add a driver for Sharp GP2AP002x00F").

Now that it was merged we can add an entry for it in the device tree
for samsung-golden.
