s390: fix syscall_get_error for compat processes

If both the tracer and the tracee are compat processes, and gprs[2]
is assigned a value by __poke_user_compat, then the higher 32 bits
of gprs[2] are cleared, IS_ERR_VALUE() always returns false, and
syscall_get_error() always returns 0.

Fix the implementation by sign-extending the value for compat processes
the same way as x86 implementation does.

The bug was exposed to user space by commit 201766a20e30f ("ptrace: add
PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO request") and detected by strace test suite.

This change fixes strace syscall tampering on s390.
