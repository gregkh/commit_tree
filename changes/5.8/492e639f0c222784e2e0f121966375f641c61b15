bpf: Add bpf_seq_printf and bpf_seq_write helpers

Two helpers bpf_seq_printf and bpf_seq_write, are added for
writing data to the seq_file buffer.

bpf_seq_printf supports common format string flag/width/type
fields so at least I can get identical results for
netlink and ipv6_route targets.

For bpf_seq_printf and bpf_seq_write, return value -EOVERFLOW
specifically indicates a write failure due to overflow, which
means the object will be repeated in the next bpf invocation
if object collection stays the same. Note that if the object
collection is changed, depending how collection traversal is
done, even if the object still in the collection, it may not
be visited.

For bpf_seq_printf, format %s, %p{i,I}{4,6} needs to
read kernel memory. Reading kernel memory may fail in
the following two cases:
  - invalid kernel address, or
  - valid kernel address but requiring a major fault
If reading kernel memory failed, the %s string will be
an empty string and %p{i,I}{4,6} will be all 0.
Not returning error to bpf program is consistent with
what bpf_trace_printk() does for now.

bpf_seq_printf may return -EBUSY meaning that internal percpu
buffer for memory copy of strings or other pointees is
not available. Bpf program can return 1 to indicate it
wants the same object to be repeated. Right now, this should not
happen on no-RT kernels since migrate_disable(), which guards
bpf prog call, calls preempt_disable().
