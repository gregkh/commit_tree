vfio iommu: Add ioctl definition for dirty pages tracking

IOMMU container maintains a list of all pages pinned by vfio_pin_pages API.
All pages pinned by vendor driver through this API should be considered as
dirty during migration. When container consists of IOMMU capable device and
all pages are pinned and mapped, then all pages are marked dirty.
Added support to start/stop dirtied pages tracking and to get bitmap of all
dirtied pages for requested IO virtual address range.
