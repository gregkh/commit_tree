KVM: nVMX: Drop a superfluous WARN on reflecting EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT

Drop the WARN in nested_vmx_reflect_vmexit() that fires if KVM attempts
to reflect an external interrupt.  The WARN is blatantly impossible to
hit now that nested_vmx_l0_wants_exit() is called from
nested_vmx_reflect_vmexit() unconditionally returns true for
EXTERNAL_INTERRUPT.
