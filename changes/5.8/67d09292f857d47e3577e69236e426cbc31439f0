drm/amd/display: Add SetBacklight call to abm on dmcub

[Why]
Set backlight calls to firmware are are being prevented by dmcu == null
check. Dmcu is expected to be null in this case.

[How]
Only prevent call if dmcu and abm are null.  Also rename variable
'use_smooth_brightness' to 'fw_set_brightness' as it's more appropriate.
