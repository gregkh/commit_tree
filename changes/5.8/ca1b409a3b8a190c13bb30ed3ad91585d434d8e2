floppy: cleanup: make set_fdc() always set current_drive and current_fd

When called with a negative drive value, set_fdc() would stick to the
current fdc (which was assumed to reflect the current_drive's FDC). We
do not need this anymore as the last call place with a negative value
was just addressed. Let's make this function always set both current_fdc
and current_drive so that there's no more ambiguity. A few comments
stating this were added to a few non-obvious places.
