mm, mempolicy: fix up gup usage in lookup_node

ba841078cd05 ("mm/mempolicy: Allow lookup_node() to handle fatal signal")
has added a special casing for 0 return value because that was a possible
gup return value when interrupted by fatal signal.  This has been fixed by
ae46d2aa6a7f ("mm/gup: Let __get_user_pages_locked() return -EINTR for
fatal signal") in the mean time so ba841078cd05 can be reverted.

This patch however doesn't go all the way to revert it because the check
for 0 is wrong and confusing here.  Firstly it is inherently unsafe to
access the page when get_user_pages_locked returns 0 (aka no page
returned).

Fortunatelly this will not happen because get_user_pages_locked will not
return 0 when nr_pages > 0 unless FOLL_NOWAIT is specified which is not
the case here.  Document this potential error code in gup code while we
are at it.
