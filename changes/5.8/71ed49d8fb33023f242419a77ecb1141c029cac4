x86/entry: Make NMI use IDTENTRY_RAW

For no reason other than beginning brainmelt, IDTENTRY_NMI was mapped to
IDTENTRY_IST.

This is not a problem on 64bit because the IST default entry point maps to
IDTENTRY_RAW which does not any entry handling. The surplus function
declaration for the noist C entry point is unused and as there is no ASM
code emitted for NMI this went unnoticed.

On 32bit IDTENTRY_IST maps to a regular IDTENTRY which does the normal
entry handling. That is clearly the wrong thing to do for NMI.

Map it to IDTENTRY_RAW to unbreak it. The IDTENTRY_NMI mapping needs to
stay to avoid emitting ASM code.
