ath10k: fix gcc-10 zero-length-bounds warnings

gcc-10 started warning about out-of-bounds access for zero-length
arrays:

In file included from drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/core.h:18,
                 from drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/htt_rx.c:8:
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/htt_rx.c: In function 'ath10k_htt_rx_tx_fetch_ind':
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/htt.h:1683:17: warning: array subscript 65535 is outside the bounds of an interior zero-length array 'struct htt_tx_fetch_record[0]' [-Wzero-length-bounds]
 1683 |  return (void *)&ind->records[le16_to_cpu(ind->num_records)];
      |                 ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
drivers/net/wireless/ath/ath10k/htt.h:1676:29: note: while referencing 'records'
 1676 |  struct htt_tx_fetch_record records[0];
      |                             ^~~~~~~

Make records[] a flexible array member to allow this, moving it behind
the other zero-length member that is not accessed in a way that gcc
warns about.
