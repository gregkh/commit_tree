RDMA/hns: Fix wrong assignment of lp_pktn_ini in QPC

The RoCE Engine will schedule to another QP after one has sent
(2 ^ lp_pktn_ini) packets. lp_pktn_ini is set in QPC and should be
calculated from 2 factors:

1. current MTU as a integer
2. the RoCE Engine's maximum slice length 64KB

But the driver use MTU as a enum ib_mtu and the max inline capability, the
lp_pktn_ini will be much bigger than expected which may cause traffic of
some QPs to never get scheduled.
