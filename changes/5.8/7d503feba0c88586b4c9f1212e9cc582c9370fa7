exec: In setup_new_exec cache current in the local variable me

At least gcc 8.3 when generating code for x86_64 has a hard time
consolidating multiple calls to current aka get_current(), and winds
up unnecessarily rereading %gs:current_task several times in
setup_new_exec.

Caching the value of current in the local variable of me generates
slightly better and shorter assembly.
