powerpc/sysfs: Show idle_purr and idle_spurr for every CPU

On Pseries LPARs, to calculate utilization, we need to know the
[S]PURR ticks when the CPUs were busy or idle.

The total PURR and SPURR ticks are already exposed via the per-cpu
sysfs files "purr" and "spurr". This patch adds support for exposing
the idle PURR and SPURR ticks via new per-cpu sysfs files named
"idle_purr" and "idle_spurr".

This patch also adds helper functions to accurately read the values of
idle_purr and idle_spurr especially from an interrupt context between
when the interrupt has occurred between the pseries_idle_prolog() and
pseries_idle_epilog(). This will ensure that the idle purr/spurr
values corresponding to the latest idle period is accounted for before
these values are read.
