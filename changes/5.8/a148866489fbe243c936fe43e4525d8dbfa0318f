sched: Replace rq::wake_list

The recent commit: 90b5363acd47 ("sched: Clean up scheduler_ipi()")
got smp_call_function_single_async() subtly wrong. Even though it will
return -EBUSY when trying to re-use a csd, that condition is not
atomic and still requires external serialization.

The change in ttwu_queue_remote() got this wrong.

While on first reading ttwu_queue_remote() has an atomic test-and-set
that appears to serialize the use, the matching 'release' is not in
the right place to actually guarantee this serialization.

The actual race is vs the sched_ttwu_pending() call in the idle loop;
that can run the wakeup-list without consuming the CSD.

Instead of trying to chain the lists, merge them.
