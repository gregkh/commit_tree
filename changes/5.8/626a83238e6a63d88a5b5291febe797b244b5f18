net: dsa: felix: accept VLAN config regardless of bridge VLAN awareness state

The ocelot core library is written with the idea in mind that the VLAN
table is populated by the bridge. Otherwise, not even a sane default
pvid is provided: in standalone mode, the default pvid is 0, and the
core expects the bridge layer to change it to 1.

So without this patch, the VLAN table is completely empty at the end of
the commands below, and traffic is broken as a result:

ip link add dev br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 0 && ip link set dev br0 up
for eth in $(ls /sys/bus/pci/devices/0000\:00\:00.5/net/); do
	ip link set dev $eth master br0
	ip link set dev $eth up
done
ip link set dev br0 type bridge vlan_filtering 1
