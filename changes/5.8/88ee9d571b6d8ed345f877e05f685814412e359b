ext4: support xattr gnu.* namespace for the Hurd

The Hurd gained[0] support for moving the translator and author
fields out of the inode and into the "gnu.*" xattr namespace.

In anticipation of that, an xattr INDEX was reserved[1].  The Hurd has
now been brought into compliance[2] with that.

This patch adds support for reading and writing such attributes from
Linux; you can now do something like

    mkdir -p hurd-root/servers/socket
    touch hurd-root/servers/socket/1
    setfattr --name=gnu.translator --value='"/hurd/pflocal\0"' \
        hurd-root/servers/socket/1
    getfattr --name=gnu.translator hurd-root/servers/socket/1
    # file: 1
    gnu.translator="/hurd/pflocal"

to setup a pipe translator, which is being used to create[3] a
vm-image for the Hurd from GNU Guix.
