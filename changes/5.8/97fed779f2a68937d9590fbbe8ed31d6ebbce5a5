arm64: bti: Provide Kconfig for kernel mode BTI

Now that all the code is in place provide a Kconfig option allowing users
to enable BTI for the kernel if their toolchain supports it, defaulting it
on since this has security benefits. This is a separate configuration
option since we currently don't support secondary CPUs that lack BTI if
the boot CPU supports it.

Code generation issues mean that current GCC 9 versions are not able to
produce usable BTI binaries so we disable support for building with GCC
versions prior to 10, once a fix is backported to GCC 9 the dependencies
will be updated.
