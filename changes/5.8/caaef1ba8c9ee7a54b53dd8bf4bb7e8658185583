vfs: don't parse "posixacl" option

Unlike the others, this is _not_ a standard option accepted by mount(8).

In fact SB_POSIXACL is an internal flag, and accepting MS_POSIXACL on the
mount(2) interface is possibly a bug.

The only filesystem that apparently wants to handle the "posixacl" option
is 9p, but it has special handling of that option besides setting
SB_POSIXACL.
