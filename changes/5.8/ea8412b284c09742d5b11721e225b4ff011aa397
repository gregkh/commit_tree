ceph: make sure mdsc->mutex is nested in s->s_mutex to fix dead lock

send_mds_reconnect takes the s_mutex while the mdsc->mutex is already
held. That inverts the locking order documented in mds_client.h. Drop
the mdsc->mutex, acquire the s_mutex and then reacquire the mdsc->mutex
to prevent a deadlock.
