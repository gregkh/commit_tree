selftests/bpf: Convert test_flow_dissector to use BPF skeleton

Switch flow dissector test setup from custom BPF object loader to BPF
skeleton to save boilerplate and prepare for testing higher-level API for
attaching flow dissector with bpf_link.

To avoid depending on program order in the BPF object when populating the
flow dissector PROG_ARRAY map, change the program section names to contain
the program index into the map. This follows the example set by tailcall
tests.
