drm: Validate encoder->possible_clones

Many drivers are populating encoder->possible_clones wrong. Let's
persuade them to get it right by adding some loud WARNs.

We'll cross check the bits between any two encoders. So either
both encoders can clone with the other, or neither can.

We'll also complain about effectively empty possible_clones, and
possible_clones containing bits for encoders that don't exist.

v2: encoder->possible_clones now includes the encoder itelf
v3: Move to drm_mode_config_validate() (Daniel)
    Document that you get a WARN when this is wrong (Daniel)
    Extract full_encoder_mask()
v4: !! instead of ! (Daniel)
