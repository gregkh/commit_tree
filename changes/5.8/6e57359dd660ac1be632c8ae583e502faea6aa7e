ARM: dts: at91: sama5d2: Remove i2s and tcb aliases from SoC dtsi

Device aliases are board-specific, if needed one should define them
in board dts rather than in the SoC dtsi. If an alias from the SoC
dtsi is addressed by a driver that does not use any of the of_alias*()
methods, we can drop it. This is the case for the i2s aliases, drop
them. tcb aliases point to nodes that are not enabled in any of the
sama5d2 based platforms. atmel_tclib.c is scheduled to go away, any
board using that alias is already broken, so get rid of the tcb aliases
too.
