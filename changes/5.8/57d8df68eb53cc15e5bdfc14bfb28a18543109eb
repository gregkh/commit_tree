thunderbolt: Add support for Intel Tiger Lake

Tiger Lake integrated Thunderbolt/USB4 controller is quite close to
Intel Ice Lake. By default it is still using firmware based connection
manager so we can use most of the Ice Lake flows in Tiger Lake as well.
We check if the firmware connection manager is running and in that case
use it, otherwise use the software based connection manager.
