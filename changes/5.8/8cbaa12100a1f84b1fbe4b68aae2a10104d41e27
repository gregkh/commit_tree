media: dvb-usb-v2: use DVB_USB_DEVICE() macro

Instead of using USB_DEVICE() macro directly, use the
DVB_USB_DEVICE() one, as other dvb-usb-v2 devices.

The usage of the new macro makes cleaner and easier to
parse the supported device names in a way that it would
be easily parseable to generate cardlists.
