sparc32: mm: Disable SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS

The SRMMU page-table allocator is not compatible with SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS
for two major reasons:

  1. Pages are allocated via memblock, and therefore the ptl is not
     cleared by prep_new_page(), which is expected by ptlock_init()

  2. Multiple PTE tables can exist in a single page, causing them to
     share the same ptl and deadlock when attempting to take the same
     lock twice (e.g. as part of copy_page_range()).

Ensure that SPLIT_PTLOCK_CPUS is not selected for SPARC32.
