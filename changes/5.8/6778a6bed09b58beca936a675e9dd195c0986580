net/smc: separate LLC wait queues for flow and messages

There might be races in scenarios where both SMC link groups are on the
same system. Prevent that by creating separate wait queues for LLC flows
and messages. Switch to non-interruptable versions of wait_event() and
wake_up() for the llc flow waiter to make sure the waiters get control
sequentially. Fine tune the llc_flow_lock to include the assignment of
the message. Write to system log when an unexpected message was
dropped. And remove an extra indirection and use the existing local
variable lgr in smc_llc_enqueue().
