ath10k: add htt TX bundle for sdio

The transmission utilization ratio for sdio bus for small packet is
slow, because the space and time cost for sdio bus is same for large
length packet and small length packet. So the speed of data for large
length packet is higher than small length.

Test result of different length of data:

data packet(byte)   cost time(us)   calculated rate(Mbps)
      256               28                73
      512               33               124
     1024               35               234
     1792               45               318
    14336              168               682
    28672              333               688
    57344              660               695

This patch change the TX packet from single packet to a large length
bundle packet, max size is 32, it results in significant performance
improvement on TX path.

Also there's a fourth thread "ath10k_tx_complete_wq" added to ath10k as it
improves TCP RX throughput (values in Mbps):

                                       TCP-RX    TCP-TX    UDP-RX      UDP-TX
use workqueue_tx_complete              423       357       448         412
change it to ar->workqueue             410       360       449         414
change it to ar->workqueue_aux         405       339       446         401

This patch only effect sdio chip, it will not effect PCI, SNOC etc.
It only enable bundle for sdio chip.

Tested with QCA6174 SDIO with firmware
WLAN.RMH.4.4.1-00017-QCARMSWP-1.
