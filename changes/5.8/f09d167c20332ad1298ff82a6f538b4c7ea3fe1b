xfs: turn dfp_done into a xfs_log_item

All defer op instance place their own extension of the log item into
the dfp_done field.  Replace that with a xfs_log_item to improve type
safety and make the code easier to follow.

Also use the opportunity to improve the ->finish_item calling conventions
to place the done log item as the higher level structure before the
list_entry used for the individual items.
