openrisc: fix boot oops when DEBUG_VM is enabled

Since v5.8-rc1 OpenRISC Linux fails to boot when DEBUG_VM is enabled.
This has been bisected to commit 42fc541404f2 ("mmap locking API: add
mmap_assert_locked() and mmap_assert_write_locked()").

The added locking checks exposed the issue that OpenRISC was not taking
this mmap lock when during page walks for DMA operations.  This patch
locks and unlocks the mmap lock for page walking.
