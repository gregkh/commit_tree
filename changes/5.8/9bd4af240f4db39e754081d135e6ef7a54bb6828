KVM: nVMX: Drop a redundant call to vmx_get_intr_info()

Drop nested_vmx_l1_wants_exit()'s initialization of intr_info from
vmx_get_intr_info() that was inadvertantly introduced along with the
caching mechanism.  EXIT_REASON_EXCEPTION_NMI, the only consumer of
intr_info, populates the variable before using it.
