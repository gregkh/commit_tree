RDMA/mlx5: Support TX port affinity for VF drivers in LAG mode

The mlx5 VF driver doesn't set QP tx port affinity because it doesn't know
if the lag is active or not, since the "lag_active" works only for PF
interfaces. In this case for VF interfaces only one lag is used which
brings performance issue.

Add a lag_tx_port_affinity CAP bit; When it is enabled and
"num_lag_ports > 1", then driver always set QP tx affinity, regardless
of lag state.
