usb: typec: mux: intel_pmc_mux: Support for static SBU/HSL orientation

The SBU and HSL orientation may be fixed/static from the mux
PoW. Apparently the retimer may take care of the orientation
of these lines. Handling the static SBU (AUX) and HSL
orientation with device properties.

If the SBU orientation is static, a device property
"sbu-orintation" can be used. When the property exists, the
driver always sets the SBU orientation according to the
property value, and when it's not set, the driver uses the
cable plug orientation with SBU.

And with static HSL orientation, "hsl-orientation" device
property can be used in the same way.
