vmxnet3: add support to get/set rx flow hash

With vmxnet3 version 4, the emulation supports multiqueue(RSS) for
UDP and ESP traffic. A guest can enable/disable RSS for UDP/ESP over
IPv4/IPv6 by issuing commands introduced in this patch. ESP ipv6 is
not yet supported in this patch.

This patch implements get_rss_hash_opts and set_rss_hash_opts
methods to allow querying and configuring different Rx flow hash
configurations.
