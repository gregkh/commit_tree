firmware: smccc: Add function to fetch SMCCC version

For backward compatibility reasons, PSCI maintains SMCCC version as
SMCCC didn't provide ARM_SMCCC_VERSION_FUNC_ID until v1.1.

PSCI initialises both the SMCCC version and conduit. Similar to the
conduit, let us provide accessors to fetch the SMCCC version also so
that other SMCCC v1.1+ features can use it.
