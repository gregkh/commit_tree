ipvs: fix the connection sync failed in some cases

The sync_thread_backup only checks sk_receive_queue is empty or not,
there is a situation which cannot sync the connection entries when
sk_receive_queue is empty and sk_rmem_alloc is larger than sk_rcvbuf,
the sync packets are dropped in __udp_enqueue_schedule_skb, this is
because the packets in reader_queue is not read, so the rmem is
not reclaimed.

Here I add the check of whether the reader_queue of the udp sock is
empty or not to solve this problem.
