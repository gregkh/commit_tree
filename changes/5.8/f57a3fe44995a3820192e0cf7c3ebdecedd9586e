erofs: convert to use the new mount fs_context api

Convert the erofs to use new internal mount API as the old one will
be obsoleted and removed.  This allows greater flexibility in
communication of mount parameters between userspace, the VFS and the
filesystem.

See Documentation/filesystems/mount_api.txt for more information.
