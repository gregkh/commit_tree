bpf: Don't return EINVAL from {get,set}sockopt when optlen > PAGE_SIZE

Attaching to these hooks can break iptables because its optval is
usually quite big, or at least bigger than the current PAGE_SIZE limit.
David also mentioned some SCTP options can be big (around 256k).

For such optvals we expose only the first PAGE_SIZE bytes to
the BPF program. BPF program has two options:
1. Set ctx->optlen to 0 to indicate that the BPF's optval
   should be ignored and the kernel should use original userspace
   value.
2. Set ctx->optlen to something that's smaller than the PAGE_SIZE.

v5:
* use ctx->optlen == 0 with trimmed buffer (Alexei Starovoitov)
* update the docs accordingly

v4:
* use temporary buffer to avoid optval == optval_end == NULL;
  this removes the corner case in the verifier that might assume
  non-zero PTR_TO_PACKET/PTR_TO_PACKET_END.

v3:
* don't increase the limit, bypass the argument

v2:
* proper comments formatting (Jakub Kicinski)
