btrfs: fix error handling when submitting direct I/O bio

In btrfs_submit_direct_hook(), if a direct I/O write doesn't span a RAID
stripe or chunk, we submit orig_bio without cloning it. In this case, we
don't increment pending_bios. Then, if btrfs_submit_dio_bio() fails, we
decrement pending_bios to -1, and we never complete orig_bio. Fix it by
initializing pending_bios to 1 instead of incrementing later.

Fixing this exposes another bug: we put orig_bio prematurely and then
put it again from end_io. Fix it by not putting orig_bio.

After this change, pending_bios is really more of a reference count, but
I'll leave that cleanup separate to keep the fix small.
