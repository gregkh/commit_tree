e1000e: continue to init PHY even when failed to disable ULP

After 'commit e086ba2fccda4 ("e1000e: disable s0ix entry and exit flows
 for ME systems")',
ThinkPad P14s always failed to disable ULP by ME.
'commit 0c80cdbf3320 ("e1000e: Warn if disabling ULP failed")'
break out of init phy:

error log:
[   42.364753] e1000e 0000:00:1f.6 enp0s31f6: Failed to disable ULP
[   42.524626] e1000e 0000:00:1f.6 enp0s31f6: PHY Wakeup cause - Unicast Packet
[   42.822476] e1000e 0000:00:1f.6 enp0s31f6: Hardware Error

When disable s0ix, E1000_FWSM_ULP_CFG_DONE will never be 1.
If continue to init phy like before, it can work as before.
iperf test result good too.
