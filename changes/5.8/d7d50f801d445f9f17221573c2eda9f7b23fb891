drm/i915/perf: Schedule oa_config after modifying the contexts

We wish that the scheduler emit the context modification commands prior
to enabling the oa_config, for which we must explicitly inform it of the
ordering constraints. This is especially important as we now wait for
the final oa_config setup to be completed and as this wait may be on a
distinct context to the state modifications, we need that command packet
to be always last in the queue.

We borrow the i915_active for its ability to track multiple timelines
and the last dma_fence on each; a flexible dma_resv. Keeping track of
each dma_fence is important for us so that we can efficiently schedule
the requests and reprioritise as required.
