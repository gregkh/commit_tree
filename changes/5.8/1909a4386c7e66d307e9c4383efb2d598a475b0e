scsi: megaraid: make two symbols static in megaraid_sas_base.c

Fix the following sparse warning:

drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c:84:5: warning: symbol
'rdpq_enable' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_sas_base.c:92:14: warning: symbol
'scmd_timeout' was not declared. Should it be static?
