gfs2: Check inode generation number in delete_work_func

In delete_work_func, if the iopen glock still has an inode attached,
limit the inode lookup to that specific generation number: in the likely
case that the inode was deleted on the node on which the inode's link
count dropped to zero, we can skip verifying the on-disk block type and
reading in the inode.  The same applies if another node that had the
inode open managed to delete the inode before us.
