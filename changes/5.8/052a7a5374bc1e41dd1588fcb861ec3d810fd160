mtd: rawnand: nandsim: Clean error handling

Many function calls are done this way:

        if ((retval = func()) != 0)
	        return retval;

while we expect in the kernel function calls like:

        retval = func();
	if (retval)
	        return retval;

Apply this change where possible and also use "ret" instead of
"retval" in ns_init_module for consistency, as it is only used in this
function.
