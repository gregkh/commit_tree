arm64: remove TEXT_OFFSET randomization

TEXT_OFFSET was recently changed to 0x0, in preparation for its removal
at a later stage, and a warning is emitted into the kernel log when the
bootloader appears to have failed to take the TEXT_OFFSET image header
value into account.

Ironically, this warning itself fails to take TEXT_OFFSET into account,
and compares the kernel image's alignment modulo 2M against a hardcoded
value of 0x0, and so the warning will trigger spuriously when TEXT_OFFSET
randomization is enabled.

Given the intent to get rid of TEXT_OFFSET entirely, let's fix this
oversight by just removing support for TEXT_OFFSET randomization.
