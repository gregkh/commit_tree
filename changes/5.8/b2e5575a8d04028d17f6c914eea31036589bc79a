extcon: arizona: Fix runtime PM imbalance on error

When arizona_request_irq() returns an error code, a
pairing runtime PM usage counter decrement is needed
to keep the counter balanced. For error paths after
this function, things are the same.

Also, remove calls to pm_runtime_disable() when
pm_runtime_enable() has not been executed.
