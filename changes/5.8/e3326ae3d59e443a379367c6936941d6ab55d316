KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Relax check on H_SVM_INIT_ABORT

The commit 8c47b6ff29e3 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Check caller of H_SVM_*
Hcalls") added checks of secure bit of SRR1 to filter out the Hcall
reserved to the Ultravisor.

However, the Hcall H_SVM_INIT_ABORT is made by the Ultravisor passing the
context of the VM calling UV_ESM. This allows the Hypervisor to return to
the guest without going through the Ultravisor. Thus the Secure bit of SRR1
is not set in that particular case.

In the case a regular VM is calling H_SVM_INIT_ABORT, this hcall will be
filtered out in kvmppc_h_svm_init_abort() because kvm->arch.secure_guest is
not set in that case.
