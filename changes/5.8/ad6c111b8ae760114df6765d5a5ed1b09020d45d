net/smc: asymmetric link tagging

New connections must not be assigned to asymmetric links. Add asymmetric
link tagging using new link variable link_is_asym. The new helpers
smcr_lgr_set_type() and smcr_lgr_set_type_asym() are called to set the
state of the link group, and tag all links accordingly.
smcr_lgr_conn_assign_link() respects the link tagging and will not
assign new connections to links tagged as asymmetric link.
