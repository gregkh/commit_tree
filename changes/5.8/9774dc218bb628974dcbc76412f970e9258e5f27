ALSA: hda/realtek - Fix Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon 7th quirk subdevice id

1)
In snd_hda_pick_fixup(), quirks are first matched by PCI SSID and then, if
there is no match, by codec SSID. The Lenovo "ThinkPad X1 Carbon 7th" has
an audio chip with PCI SSID 0x2292 and codec SSID 0x2293[1]. Therefore, fix
the quirk meant for that device to match on .subdevice == 0x2292.

2)
The "Thinkpad X1 Yoga 7th" does not exist. The companion product to the
Carbon 7th is the Yoga 4th. That device has an audio chip with PCI SSID
0x2292 and codec SSID 0x2292[2]. Given the behavior of
snd_hda_pick_fixup(), it is not possible to have a separate quirk for the
Yoga based on SSID. Therefore, merge the quirks meant for the Carbon and
Yoga. This preserves the current behavior for the Yoga.
