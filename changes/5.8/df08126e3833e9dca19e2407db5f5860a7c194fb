wireguard: receive: account for napi_gro_receive never returning GRO_DROP

The napi_gro_receive function no longer returns GRO_DROP ever, making
handling GRO_DROP dead code. This commit removes that dead code.
Further, it's not even clear that device drivers have any business in
taking action after passing off received packets; that's arguably out of
their hands.
