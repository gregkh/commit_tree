KVM: x86: move kvm_create_vcpu_debugfs after last failure point

The placement of kvm_create_vcpu_debugfs is more or less irrelevant, since
it cannot fail and userspace should not care about the debugfs entries until
it knows the vcpu has been created.  Moving it after the last failure
point removes the need to remove the directory when unwinding the creation.
