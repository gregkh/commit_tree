smack: Implement the watch_key and post_notification hooks

Implement the watch_key security hook in Smack to make sure that a key
grants the caller Read permission in order to set a watch on a key.

Also implement the post_notification security hook to make sure that the
notification source is granted Write permission by the watch queue.

For the moment, the watch_devices security hook is left unimplemented as
it's not obvious what the object should be since the queue is global and
didn't previously exist.
