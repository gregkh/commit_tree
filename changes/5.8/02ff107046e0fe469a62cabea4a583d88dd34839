scsi: megaraid: make two symbols static in megaraid_mbox.c

Fix the following sparse warning:

drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_mbox.c:305:5: warning: symbol
'dev_attr_megaraid_mbox_app_hndl' was not declared. Should it be static?
drivers/scsi/megaraid/megaraid_mbox.c:315:5: warning: symbol
'dev_attr_megaraid_mbox_ld' was not declared. Should it be static?
