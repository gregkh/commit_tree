gfs2: Allow lock_nolock mount to specify jid=X

Before this patch, a simple typo accidentally added \n to the jid=
string for lock_nolock mounts. This made it impossible to mount a
gfs2 file system with a journal other than journal0. Thus:

mount -tgfs2 -o hostdata="jid=1" <device> <mount pt>

Resulted in:
mount: wrong fs type, bad option, bad superblock on <device>

In most cases this is not a problem. However, for debugging and
testing purposes we sometimes want to test the integrity of other
journals. This patch removes the unnecessary \n and thus allows
lock_nolock users to specify an alternate journal.
