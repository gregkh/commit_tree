device property: Avoid NULL pointer dereference in device_get_next_child_node()

When we have no primary fwnode or when it's a software node, we may end up
in the situation when fwnode is a NULL pointer. There is no point to look for
secondary fwnode in such case. Add a necessary check to a condition.
