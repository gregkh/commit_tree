tty: n_gsm: Fix bogus i++ in gsm_data_kick

When submitting the previous fix "tty: n_gsm: Fix waking up upper tty
layer when room available". It was suggested to switch from a while to
a for loop, but when doing it, there was a remaining bogus i++.

This patch removes this i++ and also reorganizes the code making it more
compact.
