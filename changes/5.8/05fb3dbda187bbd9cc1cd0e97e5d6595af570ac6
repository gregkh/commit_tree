arm64: csum: Fix handling of bad packets

Although iph is expected to point to at least 20 bytes of valid memory,
ihl may be bogus, for example on reception of a corrupt packet. If it
happens to be less than 5, we really don't want to run away and
dereference 16GB worth of memory until it wraps back to exactly zero...
