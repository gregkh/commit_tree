io_uring: remove custom ->func handlers

In preparation of getting rid of work.func, this removes almost all
custom instances of it, leaving only io_wq_submit_work() and
io_link_work_cb(). And the last one will be dealt later.

Nothing fancy, just routinely remove *_finish() function and inline
what's left. E.g. remove io_fsync_finish() + inline __io_fsync() into
io_fsync().

As no users of io_req_cancelled() are left, delete it as well. The patch
adds extra switch lookup on cold-ish path, but that's overweighted by
nice diffstat and other benefits of the following patches.
