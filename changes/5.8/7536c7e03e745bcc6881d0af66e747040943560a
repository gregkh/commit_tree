of/fdt: Remove redundant kbasename function call

For version 1 to 3 of the device tree, this is the node full
path as a zero terminated string, starting with "/". The
following equation will not hold, since the node name has
been processed in the fdt_get_name().

	*pathp == '/'

For version 16 and later, this is the node unit name only
(or an empty string for the root node). So the above
equation will still not hold.

So the kbasename() is redundant, just remove it.
