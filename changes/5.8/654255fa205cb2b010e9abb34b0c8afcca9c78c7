ovl: inherit SB_NOSEC flag from upperdir

Since the stacking of regular file operations [1], the overlayfs edition of
write_iter() is called when writing regular files.

Since then, xattr lookup is needed on every write since file_remove_privs()
is called from ovl_write_iter(), which would become the performance
bottleneck when writing small chunks of data. In my test case,
file_remove_privs() would consume ~15% CPU when running fstime of unixbench
(the workload is repeadly writing 1 KB to the same file) [2].

Inherit the SB_NOSEC flag from upperdir. Since then xattr lookup would be
done only once on the first write. Unixbench fstime gets a ~20% performance
gain with this patch.
