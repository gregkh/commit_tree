bpf: Allow skb_ancestor_cgroup_id helper in cgroup skb

cgroup skb programs already can use bpf_skb_cgroup_id. Allow
bpf_skb_ancestor_cgroup_id as well so that container policies can be
implemented for a container that can have sub-cgroups dynamically
created, but policies should still be implemented based on cgroup id of
container itself not on an id of a sub-cgroup.
