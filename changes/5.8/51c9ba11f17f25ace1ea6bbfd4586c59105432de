powerpc/xmon: Move breakpoint instructions to own array

To execute an instruction out of line after a breakpoint, the NIP is set
to the address of struct bpt::instr. Here a copy of the instruction that
was replaced with a breakpoint is kept, along with a trap so normal flow
can be resumed after XOLing. The struct bpt's are located within the
data section. This is problematic as the data section may be marked as
no execute.

Instead of each struct bpt holding the instructions to be XOL'd, make a
new array, bpt_table[], with enough space to hold instructions for the
number of supported breakpoints. A later patch will move this to the
text section.
Make struct bpt::instr a pointer to the instructions in bpt_table[]
associated with that breakpoint. This association is a simple mapping:
bpts[n] -> bpt_table[n * words per breakpoint]. Currently we only need
the copied instruction followed by a trap, so 2 words per breakpoint.
