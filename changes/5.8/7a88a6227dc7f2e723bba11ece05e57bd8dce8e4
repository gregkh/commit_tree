efi/libstub: Fix path separator regression

Commit 9302c1bb8e47 ("efi/libstub: Rewrite file I/O routine") introduced a
regression that made a couple of (badly configured) systems fail to
boot [1]: Until 5.6, we silently accepted Unix-style file separators in
EFI paths, which might violate the EFI standard, but are an easy to make
mistake. This fix restores the pre-5.7 behaviour.
