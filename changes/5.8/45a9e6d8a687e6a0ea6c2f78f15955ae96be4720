veth: Xdp using frame_sz in veth driver

The veth driver can run XDP in "native" mode in it's own NAPI
handler, and since commit 9fc8d518d9d5 ("veth: Handle xdp_frames in
xdp napi ring") packets can come in two forms either xdp_frame or
skb, calling respectively veth_xdp_rcv_one() or veth_xdp_rcv_skb().

For packets to arrive in xdp_frame format, they will have been
redirected from an XDP native driver. In case of XDP_PASS or no
XDP-prog attached, the veth driver will allocate and create an SKB.

The current code in veth_xdp_rcv_one() xdp_frame case, had to guess
the frame truesize of the incoming xdp_frame, when using
veth_build_skb(). With xdp_frame->frame_sz this is not longer
necessary.

Calculating the frame_sz in veth_xdp_rcv_skb() skb case, is done
similar to the XDP-generic handling code in net/core/dev.c.
