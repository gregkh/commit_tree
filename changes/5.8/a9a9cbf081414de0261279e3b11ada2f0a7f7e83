ASoC: SOF: make sof_ipc_cc_version to fixed length

Align struct sof_ipc_cc_version to firmware definition in SOF ABI 3.15.0.

The struct definition was changed due to errors in FW build.
The Cadence XCC compiler produces incorrect linkage section sizes, when a
variable length array is used in the compiler version struct. The firmware
definition was changed to a fixed 32 byte compiler description string.
This length covers all released firmware binaries and thus only a minor
ABI change is needed.

As the same structure is used in IPC messages between driver and firmware,
the kernel needs to be aligned to firmware change.
