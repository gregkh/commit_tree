staging: vt6656: vt6655: removing unused macros definition Makefiles

This patch is removing definition of CFLAGS in Makefile of vt6656 and
vt6655, as those are defining macros that are not used. This will remove
undef of one macro from vt6655/device_main.c, as it is only undef and it is
not used anywhere else, so it is safe to remove it.

Macros are removed from vt665x/Makefile and vt6655/device_main.c.
