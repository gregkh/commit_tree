staging: qlge: Fix indentation in ql_set_mac_addr_reg

Based on Joe Perches' feedback, fix the indentation throughout
ql_set_mac_addr_reg. This helps fix several "line over 80 characters"
warnings along with the original "multiple line dereference" warning.

Fix checkpatch.pl warnings:

  WARNING: Avoid multiple line dereference - prefer 'qdev->func'
  WARNING: line over 80 characters
