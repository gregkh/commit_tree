modpost: remove use of non-standard strsep() in HOSTCC code

strsep() is neither standard C nor POSIX and used outside
the kernel code here. Using it here requires that the
build host supports it out of the box which is e.g.
not true for a Darwin build host and using a cross-compiler.
This leads to:

scripts/mod/modpost.c:145:2: warning: implicit declaration of function 'strsep' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
  return strsep(stringp, "\n");
  ^

and a segfault when running MODPOST.

So let's replace this by strchr() instead of using strsep().
It does not hurt kernel size or speed since this code is run
on the build host.
