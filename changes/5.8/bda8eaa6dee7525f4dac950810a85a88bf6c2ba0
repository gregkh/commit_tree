drm: sun4i: hdmi: Remove extra HPD polling

The HPD sense mechanism in Allwinner's old HDMI encoder hardware is more
or less an input-only GPIO. Other GPIO-based HPD implementations
directly return the current state, instead of polling for a specific
state and returning the other if that times out.

Remove the I/O polling from sun4i_hdmi_connector_detect() and directly
return a known state based on the current reading. This also gets rid
of excessive CPU usage by kworker as reported on Stack Exchange [1] and
Armbian forums [2].
