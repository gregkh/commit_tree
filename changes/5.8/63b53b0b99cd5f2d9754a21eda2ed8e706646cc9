cxgb4: fix endian conversions for L4 ports in filters

The source and destination L4 ports in filter offload need to be
in CPU endian. They will finally be converted to Big Endian after
all operations are done and before giving them to hardware. The
L4 ports for NAT are expected to be passed as a byte stream TCB.
So, treat them as such.

Fixes following sparse warnings in several places:
cxgb4_tc_flower.c:159:33: warning: cast from restricted __be16
cxgb4_tc_flower.c:159:33: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different
base types)
cxgb4_tc_flower.c:159:33:    expected unsigned short [usertype] val
cxgb4_tc_flower.c:159:33:    got restricted __be16 [usertype] dst
