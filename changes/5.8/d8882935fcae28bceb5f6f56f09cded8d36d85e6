ipv6: use DST_NOCOUNT in ip6_rt_pcpu_alloc()

We currently have to adjust ipv6 route gc_thresh/max_size depending
on number of cpus on a server, this makes very little sense.

If the kernels sets /proc/sys/net/ipv6/route/gc_thresh to 1024
and /proc/sys/net/ipv6/route/max_size to 4096, then we better
not track the percpu dst that our implementation uses.

Only routes not added (directly or indirectly) by the admin
should be tracked and limited.
