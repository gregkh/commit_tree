ASoC: qdsp6: Suggest more generic node names

Change the listed examples to use more generic node names, representing
the class of the device nodes:

  - apr-service@<id>
  - dai@<id>

Both names are already in use in arch/arm64/boot/dts/qcom/sdm845.dtsi.

Also add #address-cells + #size-cells to the q6asm example,
without them the example produces dtc warnings.
