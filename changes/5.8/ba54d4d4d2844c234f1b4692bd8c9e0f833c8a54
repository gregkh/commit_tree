raid5: remove gfp flags from scribble_alloc()

Using GFP_NOIO flag to call scribble_alloc() from resize_chunk() does
not have the expected behavior. kvmalloc_array() inside scribble_alloc()
which receives the GFP_NOIO flag will eventually call kmalloc_node() to
allocate physically continuous pages.

Now we have memalloc scope APIs in mddev_suspend()/mddev_resume() to
prevent memory reclaim I/Os during raid array suspend context, calling
to kvmalloc_array() with GFP_KERNEL flag may avoid deadlock of recursive
I/O as expected.

This patch removes the useless gfp flags from parameters list of
scribble_alloc(), and call kvmalloc_array() with GFP_KERNEL flag. The
incorrect GFP_NOIO flag does not exist anymore.
