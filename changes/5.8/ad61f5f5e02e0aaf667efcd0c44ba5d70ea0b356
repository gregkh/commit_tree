drm/nouveau/svm: fix migrate page regression

The patch to add zero page migration to GPU memory inadvertently included
part of a future change which broke normal page migration to GPU memory
by copying too much data and corrupting GPU memory.
Fix this by only copying one page instead of a byte count.
