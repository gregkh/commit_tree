drm/amd/display: Prevent dpcd reads with passive dongles

[why]
During hotplug, a DP port may be connected to the sink through
passive adapter which does not support DPCD reads. Issuing reads
without checking for this condition will result in errors

[how]
Ensure the link is in aux_mode before initiating operation that result
in a DPCD read.
