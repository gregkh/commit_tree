rtw88: 8723d: Add set_channel

Set MAC/BB/RF register according to specified channel. The function
rtw_set_channel_mac() is used to set MAC registers, but 8723D only need
some of them.

For channel 14, we need to set different CCK DFIR values, so restore the
values when channel 1 to 13 is selected.

Spur calibration is needed in channel 13 and 14, and we do notch if spur
is over threshold.
