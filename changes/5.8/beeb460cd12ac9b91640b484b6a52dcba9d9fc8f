crypto: algapi - Avoid spurious modprobe on LOADED

Currently after any algorithm is registered and tested, there's an
unnecessary request_module("cryptomgr") even if it's already loaded.
Also, CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_LOADED is sent twice, and thus if the algorithm is
"crct10dif", lib/crc-t10dif.c replaces the tfm twice rather than once.

This occurs because CRYPTO_MSG_ALG_LOADED is sent using
crypto_probing_notify(), which tries to load "cryptomgr" if the
notification is not handled (NOTIFY_DONE).  This doesn't make sense
because "cryptomgr" doesn't handle this notification.

Fix this by using crypto_notify() instead of crypto_probing_notify().
