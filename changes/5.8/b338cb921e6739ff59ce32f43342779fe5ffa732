bpf: Restore behaviour of CAP_SYS_ADMIN allowing the loading of networking bpf programs

This is a fix for a regression in commit 2c78ee898d8f ("bpf: Implement CAP_BPF").
Before the above commit it was possible to load network bpf programs
with just the CAP_SYS_ADMIN privilege.

The Android bpfloader happens to run in such a configuration (it has
SYS_ADMIN but not NET_ADMIN) and creates maps and loads bpf programs
for later use by Android's netd (which has NET_ADMIN but not SYS_ADMIN).
