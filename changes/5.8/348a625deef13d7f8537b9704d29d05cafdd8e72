arm64: rename stext to primary_entry

For historical reasons, the primary entry routine living somewhere in
the inittext section is called stext(), which is confusing, given that
there is also a section marker called _stext which lives at a fixed
offset in the image (either 64 or 4096 bytes, depending on whether
CONFIG_EFI is enabled)

Let's rename stext to primary_entry(), which is a better description
and reflects the secondary_entry() routine that already exists for
SMP boot.
