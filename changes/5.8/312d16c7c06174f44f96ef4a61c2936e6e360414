KVM: x86/mmu: Avoid mixing gpa_t with gfn_t in walk_addr_generic()

translate_gpa() returns a GPA, assigning it to 'real_gfn' seems obviously
wrong. There is no real issue because both 'gpa_t' and 'gfn_t' are u64 and
we don't use the value in 'real_gfn' as a GFN, we do

 real_gfn = gpa_to_gfn(real_gfn);

instead. 'If you see a "buffalo" sign on an elephant's cage, do not trust
your eyes', but let's fix it for good.

No functional change intended.
