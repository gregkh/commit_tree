Drivers: hv: Change flag to write log level in panic msg to false

When the kernel panics, one page of kmsg data may be collected and sent to
Hyper-V to aid in diagnosing the failure.  The collected kmsg data typically
 contains 50 to 100 lines, each of which has a log level prefix that isn't
very useful from a diagnostic standpoint.  So tell kmsg_dump_get_buffer()
to not include the log level, enabling more information that *is* useful to
fit in the page.

Requesting in stable kernels, since many kernels running in production are
stable releases.
