habanalabs: leave space for 2xMSG_PROT in CB

The user must leave space for 2xMSG_PROT in the external CB, so adjust the
define of max size accordingly. The driver, however, can still create a CB
with the maximum size of 2MB. Therefore, we need to add a check
specifically for the user requested size.
