rcu: Add rcu_gp_might_be_stalled()

This commit adds rcu_gp_might_be_stalled(), which returns true if there
is some reason to believe that the RCU grace period is stalled.  The use
case is where an RCU free-memory path needs to allocate memory in order
to free it, a situation that should be avoided where possible.

But where it is necessary, there is always the alternative of using
synchronize_rcu() to wait for a grace period in order to avoid the
allocation.  And if the grace period is stalled, allocating memory to
asynchronously wait for it is a bad idea of epic proportions: Far better
to let others use the memory, because these others might actually be
able to free that memory before the grace period ends.

Thus, rcu_gp_might_be_stalled() can be used to help decide whether
allocating memory on an RCU free path is a semi-reasonable course
of action.
