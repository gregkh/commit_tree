KVM: selftests: Add "zero" testcase to set_memory_region_test

Add a testcase for running a guest with no memslots to the memory region
test.  The expected result on x86_64 is that the guest will trigger an
internal KVM error due to the initial code fetch encountering a
non-existent memslot and resulting in an emulation failure.
