mm: rename gfpflags_to_migratetype to gfp_migratetype for same convention

Pageblock migrate type is encoded in GFP flags, just as zone_type and
zonelist.

Currently we use gfp_zone() and gfp_zonelist() to extract related
information, it would be proper to use the same naming convention for
migrate type.
