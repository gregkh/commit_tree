eventfd: convert to f_op->read_iter()

eventfd is using ->read() as it's file_operations read handler, but
this prevents passing in information about whether a given IO operation
is blocking or not. We can only use the file flags for that. To support
async (-EAGAIN/poll based) retries for io_uring, we need ->read_iter()
support. Convert eventfd to using ->read_iter().

With ->read_iter(), we can support IOCB_NOWAIT. Ensure the fd setup
is done such that we set file->f_mode with FMODE_NOWAIT.
