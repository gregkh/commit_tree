x86/resctrl: Support CPUID enumeration of MBM counter width

The original Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM) architectural
definition defines counters of up to 62 bits in the
IA32_QM_CTR MSR while the first-generation MBM implementation
uses statically defined 24 bit counters.

Expand the MBM CPUID enumeration properties to include the MBM
counter width. The previously undefined EAX output register contains,
in bits [7:0], the MBM counter width encoded as an offset from
24 bits. Enumerating this property is only specified for Intel
CPUs.
