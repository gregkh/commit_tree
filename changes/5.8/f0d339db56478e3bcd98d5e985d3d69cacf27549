x86/resctrl: Remove unnecessary RMID checks

The cache and memory bandwidth monitoring properties are read using
CPUID on every CPU. After the information is read from the system a
sanity check is run to

 (1) ensure that the RMID data is initialized for the boot CPU in case
     the information was not available on the boot CPU and

 (2) the boot CPU's RMID is set to the minimum of RMID obtained
     from all CPUs.

Every known platform that supports resctrl has the same maximum RMID
on all CPUs. Both sanity checks found in x86_init_cache_qos() can thus
safely be removed.
