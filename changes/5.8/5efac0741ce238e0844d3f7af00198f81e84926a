KVM: x86: introduce kvm_mmu_invalidate_gva

Wrap the combination of mmu->invlpg and kvm_x86_ops->tlb_flush_gva
into a new function.  This function also lets us specify the host PGD to
invalidate and also the MMU, both of which will be useful in fixing and
simplifying kvm_inject_emulated_page_fault.

A nested guest's MMU however has g_context->invlpg == NULL.  Instead of
setting it to nonpaging_invlpg, make kvm_mmu_invalidate_gva the only
entry point to mmu->invlpg and make a NULL invlpg pointer equivalent
to nonpaging_invlpg, saving a retpoline.
