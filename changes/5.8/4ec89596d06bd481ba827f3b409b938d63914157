afs: Fix the mapping of the UAEOVERFLOW abort code

Abort code UAEOVERFLOW is returned when we try and set a time that's out of
range, but it's currently mapped to EREMOTEIO by the default case.

Fix UAEOVERFLOW to map instead to EOVERFLOW.

Found with the generic/258 xfstest.  Note that the test is wrong as it
assumes that the filesystem will support a pre-UNIX-epoch date.
