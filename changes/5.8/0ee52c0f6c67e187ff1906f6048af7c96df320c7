bpf, bpftool: Allow probing for CONFIG_HZ from kernel config

In Cilium we've recently switched to make use of bpf_jiffies64() for
parts of our tc and XDP datapath since bpf_ktime_get_ns() is more
expensive and high-precision is not needed for our timeouts we have
anyway. Our agent has a probe manager which picks up the json of
bpftool's feature probe and we also use the macro output in our C
programs e.g. to have workarounds when helpers are not available on
older kernels.

Extend the kernel config info dump to also include the kernel's
CONFIG_HZ, and rework the probe_kernel_image_config() for allowing a
macro dump such that CONFIG_HZ can be propagated to BPF C code as a
simple define if available via config. Latter allows to have _compile-
time_ resolution of jiffies <-> sec conversion in our code since all
are propagated as known constants.

Given we cannot generally assume availability of kconfig everywhere,
we also have a kernel hz probe [0] as a fallback. Potentially, bpftool
could have an integrated probe fallback as well, although to derive it,
we might need to place it under 'bpftool feature probe full' or similar
given it would slow down the probing process overall. Yet 'full' doesn't
fit either for us since we don't want to pollute the kernel log with
warning messages from bpf_probe_write_user() and bpf_trace_printk() on
agent startup; I've left it out for the time being.
