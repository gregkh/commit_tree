IB/hfi1: Activate the dummy netdev

As described in earlier patches, ipoib netdev will share receive
contexts with existing VNIC netdev through a dummy netdev. The
following changes are made to achieve that:
- Set up netdev receive contexts after user contexts. A function is
  added to count the available netdev receive contexts.
- Add functions to set/get receive map table free index.
- Rename NUM_VNIC_MAP_ENTRIES as NUM_NETDEV_MAP_ENTRIES.
- Let the dummy netdev own the receive contexts instead of VNIC.
- Allocate the dummy netdev when the hfi1 device is added and free it
  when the device is removed.
- Initialize AIP RSM rules when the IpoIb rxq is initialized and
  remove the rules when it is de-initialized.
- Convert VNIC to use the dummy netdev.
