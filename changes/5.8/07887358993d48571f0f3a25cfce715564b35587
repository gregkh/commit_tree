lib: Add might_fault() to strncpy_from_user.

When updating a piece of broken logic from using get_user to
strncpy_from_user, we noticed that a warning which is expected when
calling a function that might fault from an atomic context with
pagefaults enabled disappeared.

Not having this warning in place can lead to calling strncpy_from_user
from an atomic context and eventually kernel crashes/stack corruption.
