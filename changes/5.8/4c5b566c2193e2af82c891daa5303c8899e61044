crash_dump: Remove no longer used saved_max_pfn

saved_max_pfn was originally introduced in commit

  92aa63a5a1bf ("[PATCH] kdump: Retrieve saved max pfn")

It used to make sure that the user does not try to read the physical memory
beyond saved_max_pfn. But since commit

  921d58c0e699 ("vmcore: remove saved_max_pfn check")

it's no longer used for the check. This variable doesn't have any users
anymore so just remove it.

 [ bp: Drop the Calgary IOMMU reference from the commit message. ]
