statx: don't clear STATX_ATIME on SB_RDONLY

IS_NOATIME(inode) is defined as __IS_FLG(inode, SB_RDONLY|SB_NOATIME), so
generic_fillattr() will clear STATX_ATIME from the result_mask if the super
block is marked read only.

This was probably not the intention, so fix to only clear STATX_ATIME if
the fs doesn't support atime at all.
