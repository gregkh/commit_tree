sched: Warn if garbage is passed to default_wake_function()

Since the default_wake_function() passes its flags onto
try_to_wake_up(), warn if those flags collide with internal values.

Given that the supplied flags are garbage, no repair can be done but at
least alert the user to the damage they are causing.

In the belief that these errors should be picked up during testing, the
warning is only compiled in under CONFIG_SCHED_DEBUG.
