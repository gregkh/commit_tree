x86/hyperv: Split hyperv-tlfs.h into arch dependent and independent files

In preparation for adding ARM64 support, split hyperv-tlfs.h into
architecture dependent and architecture independent files, similar
to what has been done with mshyperv.h. Move architecture independent
definitions into include/asm-generic/hyperv-tlfs.h.  The split will
avoid duplicating significant lines of code in the ARM64 version of
hyperv-tlfs.h.  The split has no functional impact.

Some of the common definitions have "X64" in the symbol name.  Change
these to remove the "X64" in the architecture independent version of
hyperv-tlfs.h, but add aliases with the "X64" in the x86 version so
that x86 code will continue to compile.  A later patch set will
change all the references and allow removal of the aliases.
