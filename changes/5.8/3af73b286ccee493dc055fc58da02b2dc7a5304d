io_uring: don't derive close state from ->func

Relying on having a specific work.func is dangerous, even if an opcode
handler set it itself. E.g. io_wq_assign_next() can modify it.

io_close() sets a custom work.func to indicate that
__close_fd_get_file() was already called. Fortunately, there is no bugs
with io_wq_assign_next() and close yet.

Still, do it safe and always be prepared to be called through
io_wq_submit_work(). Zero req->close.put_file in prep, and call
__close_fd_get_file() IFF it's NULL.
