netfilter: nf_conntrack: add IPS_HW_OFFLOAD status bit

This bit indicates that the conntrack entry is offloaded to hardware
flow table. nf_conntrack entry will be tagged with [HW_OFFLOAD] if
it's offload to hardware.

cat /proc/net/nf_conntrack
	ipv4 2 tcp 6 \
	src=1.1.1.17 dst=1.1.1.16 sport=56394 dport=5001 \
	src=1.1.1.16 dst=1.1.1.17 sport=5001 dport=56394 [HW_OFFLOAD] \
	mark=0 zone=0 use=3

Note that HW_OFFLOAD/OFFLOAD/ASSURED are mutually exclusive.

Changelog:

* V1->V2:
- Remove check of lastused from stats. It was meant for cases such
  as removing driver module while traffic still running. Better to
  handle such cases from garbage collector.
