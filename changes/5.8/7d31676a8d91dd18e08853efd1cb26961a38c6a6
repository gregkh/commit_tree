tty: serial: samsung: Correct clock selection logic

Some variants of the samsung tty driver can pick which clock
to use for their baud rate generation.  In the DT conversion,
a default clock was selected to be used if a specific one wasn't
assigned and then a comparison of which clock rate worked better
was done.  Unfortunately, the comparison was implemented in such
a way that only the default clock was ever actually compared.
Fix this by iterating through all possible clocks, except when a
specific clock has already been picked via clk_sel (which is
only possible via board files).
