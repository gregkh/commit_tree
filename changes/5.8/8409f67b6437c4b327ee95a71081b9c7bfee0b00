afs: Adjust the fileserver rotation algorithm to reprobe/retry more quickly

Adjust the fileserver rotation algorithm so that if we've tried all the
addresses on a server (cumulatively over multiple operations) until we've
run out of untried addresses, immediately reprobe all that server's
interfaces and retry the op at least once before we move onto the next
server.
