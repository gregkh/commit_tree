efi/libstub: Move arm-stub to a common file

Most of the arm-stub code is written in an architecture independent manner.
As a result, RISC-V can reuse most of the arm-stub code.

Rename the arm-stub.c to efi-stub.c so that ARM, ARM64 and RISC-V can use it.
This patch doesn't introduce any functional changes.
