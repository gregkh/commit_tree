rcu: Don't set nesting depth negative in rcu_preempt_deferred_qs()

Now that RCU flavors have been consolidated, an RCU-preempt
rcu_read_unlock() in an interrupt or softirq handler cannot possibly
end the RCU read-side critical section.  Consider the old vulnerability
involving rcu_preempt_deferred_qs() being invoked within such a handler
that interrupted an extended RCU read-side critical section, in which
a wakeup might be invoked with a scheduler lock held.  Because
rcu_read_unlock_special() no longer does wakeups in such situations,
it is no longer necessary for rcu_preempt_deferred_qs() to set the
nesting level negative.

This commit therefore removes this recursion-protection code from
rcu_preempt_deferred_qs().
