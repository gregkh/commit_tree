vfs, afs, ext4: Make the inode hash table RCU searchable

Make the inode hash table RCU searchable so that searches that want to
access or modify an inode without taking a ref on that inode can do so
without taking the inode hash table lock.

The main thing this requires is some RCU annotation on the list
manipulation operations.  Inodes are already freed by RCU in most cases.

Users of this interface must take care as the inode may be still under
construction or may be being torn down around them.

There are at least three instances where this can be of use:

 (1) Testing whether the inode number iunique() is going to return is
     currently unique (the iunique_lock is still held).

 (2) Ext4 date stamp updating.

 (3) AFS callback breaking.
