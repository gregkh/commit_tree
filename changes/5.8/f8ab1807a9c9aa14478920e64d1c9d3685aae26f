net: sched: introduce terse dump flag

Add new TCA_DUMP_FLAGS attribute and use it in cls API to request terse
filter output from classifiers with TCA_DUMP_FLAGS_TERSE flag. This option
is intended to be used to improve performance of TC filter dump when
userland only needs to obtain stats and not the whole classifier/action
data. Extend struct tcf_proto_ops with new terse_dump() callback that must
be defined by supporting classifier implementations.

Support of the options in specific classifiers and actions is
implemented in following patches in the series.
