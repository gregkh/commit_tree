bus: mhi: core: Ensure non-zero session or sequence ID values are used

While writing any sequence or session identifiers, it is possible that
the host could write a zero value, whereas only non-zero values should
be supported writes to those registers. Ensure that the host does not
write a non-zero value for them and also log them in debug messages. A
macro is introduced to simplify this check and the existing checks are
also converted to use this macro.
