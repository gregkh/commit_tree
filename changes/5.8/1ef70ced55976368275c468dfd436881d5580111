scripts: sphinx-pre-install: change the warning for version < 2.4.4

As requested by Jon, change the version check, in order to not

	Sphinx version 1.7.9
	Note: It is recommended at least Sphinx version 2.4.4 if you need PDF support.

		deactivate

	Needed package dependencies are met.

If Sphinx is not detected at all, it
