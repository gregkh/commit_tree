nbd: Fix memory leak in nbd_add_socket

When adding first socket to nbd, if nsock's allocation failed, the data
structure member "config->socks" was reallocated, but the data structure
member "config->num_connections" was not updated. A memory leak will occur
then because the function "nbd_config_put" will free "config->socks" only
when "config->num_connections" is not zero.
