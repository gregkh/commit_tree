btrfs: reloc: use btrfs_backref_iter infrastructure

In the core function of relocation, build_backref_tree, it needs to
iterate all backref items of one tree block.

Use btrfs_backref_iter infrastructure to do the loop and make the code
more readable.

The backref items look would be much more easier to read:

	ret = btrfs_backref_iter_start(iter, cur->bytenr);
	for (; ret == 0; ret = btrfs_backref_iter_next(iter)) {
		/* The really important work */
	}
