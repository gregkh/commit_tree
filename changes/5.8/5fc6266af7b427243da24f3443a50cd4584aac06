bridge: mcast: Fix MLD2 Report IPv6 payload length check

Commit e57f61858b7c ("net: bridge: mcast: fix stale nsrcs pointer in
igmp3/mld2 report handling") introduced a bug in the IPv6 header payload
length check which would potentially lead to rejecting a valid MLD2 Report:

The check needs to take into account the 2 bytes for the "Number of
Sources" field in the "Multicast Address Record" before reading it.
And not the size of a pointer to this field.
