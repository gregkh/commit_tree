spi: hisi-sfc-v3xx: add error check after per operation

The controller may receive instructions of accessing protected address,
or may perform failed page program. These operations will not succeed
and the controller will receive interrupts when such failure occur.
Previously we don't check the interrupts and return 0 even if such
operation fails.

Check the interrupts after per command and inform the user
if there is an error.
