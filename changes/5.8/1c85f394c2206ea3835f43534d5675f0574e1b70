net: qede: fix PTP initialization on recovery

Currently PTP cyclecounter and timecounter are initialized only on
the first probing and are cleaned up during removal. This means that
PTP becomes non-functional after device recovery.
Fix this by unconditional PTP initialization on probing and clearing
Tx pending bit on exiting.
