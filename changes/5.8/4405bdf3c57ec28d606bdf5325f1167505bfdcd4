ARM: 8987/1: VDSO: Fix incorrect clock_gettime64

__vdso_*() should be removed and fallback used if CNTCVT is not
available by cntvct_functional(). __vdso_clock_gettime64 when added
previous commit is using the incorrect CNTCVT value in that state.
__vdso_clock_gettime64 is also added to remove it's symbol.
