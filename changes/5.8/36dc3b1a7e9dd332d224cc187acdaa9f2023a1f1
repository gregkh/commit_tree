ARM: tegra: Initialize r0 register for firmware wake-up

Downstream kernel of ASUS TF300T sets r0 to #3. There is no explanation in
downstream code whether this is really needed and some of T30 downstream
kernels have and explicit comment telling that all arguments are ignored
by firmware. Let's take a safe side by replicating behavior of the TF300T
downstream kernel. This change works fine on Ouya and Nexus 7 devices.
