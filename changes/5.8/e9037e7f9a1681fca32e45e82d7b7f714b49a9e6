drm/i915: Extend intel_wakeref to support delayed puts

In some cases we want to hold onto the wakeref for a little after the
last user so that we can avoid having to drop and then immediately
reacquire it. Allow the last user to specify if they would like to keep
the wakeref alive for a short hysteresis.

v2: Embrace bitfield.h for adjustable flags.
