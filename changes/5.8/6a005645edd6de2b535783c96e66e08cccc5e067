mm/gup: documentation fix for pin_user_pages*() APIs

All of the pin_user_pages*() API calls will cause pages to be
dma-pinned.  As such, they are all suitable for either DMA, RDMA, and/or
Direct IO.

The documentation should say so, but it was instead saying that three of
the API calls were only suitable for Direct IO.  This was discovered
when a reviewer wondered why an API call that specifically recommended
against Case 2 (DMA/RDMA) was being used in a DMA situation [1].

Fix this by simply deleting those claims.  The gup.c comments already
refer to the more extensive Documentation/core-api/pin_user_pages.rst,
which does have the correct guidance.  So let's just write it once,
there.
