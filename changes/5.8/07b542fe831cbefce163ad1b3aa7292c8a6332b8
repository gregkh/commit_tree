ASoC: codecs: rt*-sdw: fix memory leak in set_sdw_stream()

Now that the sdw_stream is allocated in machine driver,
set_sdw_stream() is also called with a NULL argument during the
dailink shutdown.

In this case, the drivers should not allocate any memory, and just
return.

Detected with KASAN/kmemleak.
