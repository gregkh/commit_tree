mlxsw: core: Increase scope of RCU read-side critical section

The lifetime of the Rx listener item ('rxl_item') is managed using RCU,
but is dereferenced outside of RCU read-side critical section, which can
lead to a use-after-free.

Fix this by increasing the scope of the RCU read-side critical section.
