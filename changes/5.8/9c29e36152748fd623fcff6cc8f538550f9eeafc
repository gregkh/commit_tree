mptcp: fix DSS map generation on fin retransmission

The RFC 8684 mandates that no-data DATA FIN packets should carry
a DSS with 0 sequence number and data len equal to 1. Currently,
on FIN retransmission we re-use the existing mapping; if the previous
fin transmission was part of a partially acked data packet, we could
end-up writing in the egress packet a non-compliant DSS.

The above will be detected by a "Bad mapping" warning on the receiver
side.

This change addresses the issue explicitly checking for 0 len packet
when adding the DATA_FIN option.

Fixes: 6d0060f600ad ("mptcp: Write MPTCP DSS headers to outgoing data packets")
