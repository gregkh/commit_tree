btrfs: speed up btrfs_get_##bits helpers

The helpers unconditionally call map_private_extent_buffer to get the
address of page containing the requested offset plus the mapping start
and length. Depending on the return value, the fast path uses unaligned
read to get data within a page, or fall back to read_extent_buffer that
can handle reads spanning more pages.

This is all wasteful. We know the number of bytes to read, 1/2/4/8 and
can find out the page. Then simply check if it's contained or the
fallback is needed.

This saves one function call to map_private_extent_buffer and several
unnecessary temporary variables.
