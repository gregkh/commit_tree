virtiofs: schedule blocking async replies in separate worker

In virtiofs (unlike in regular fuse) processing of async replies is
serialized.  This can result in a deadlock in rare corner cases when
there's a circular dependency between the completion of two or more async
replies.

Such a deadlock can be reproduced with xfstests:generic/503 if TEST_DIR ==
SCRATCH_MNT (which is a misconfiguration):

 - Process A is waiting for page lock in worker thread context and blocked
   (virtio_fs_requests_done_work()).
 - Process B is holding page lock and waiting for pending writes to
   finish (fuse_wait_on_page_writeback()).
 - Write requests are waiting in virtqueue and can't complete because
   worker thread is blocked on page lock (process A).

Fix this by creating a unique work_struct for each async reply that can
block (O_DIRECT read).
