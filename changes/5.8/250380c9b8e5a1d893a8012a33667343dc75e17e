iwlwifi: support version 9 of WOWLAN_GET_STATUS notification

Add support for the new WOWLAN_GET_STATUS notification that contains a
new element that informs the driver of TIDs whose BA sessions were
closed during suspend.

Note that the new functionality of handling these closed sessions is not
implemented in this patch it.  It only aligns to the new API version.
