remoteproc: sysmon: Add ability to send type of notification

Current implementation of the sysmon driver does not support adding
notifications for other remoteproc events - prepare, start, unprepare.
Clients on the remoteproc side might be interested in knowing when a
remoteproc boots up. This change adds the ability to send the notification
type along with the name. For example, audio DSP is interested in knowing
when modem has crashed so that it can perform cleanup and wait for modem to
boot up before it starts processing data again.
