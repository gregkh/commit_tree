serial: stm32: add no_console_suspend support

In order to display console messages in low power mode, console pins
must be kept active after suspend call.

Initial patch "serial: stm32: add support for no_console_suspend" was part
of "STM32 usart power improvement" series, but as dependancy to
console_suspend pinctl state has been removed to fit with Rob comment [1],
this patch has no more dependancy with any other patch of this series.
