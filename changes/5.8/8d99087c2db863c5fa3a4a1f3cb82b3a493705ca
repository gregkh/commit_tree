usb: dwc3: gadget: Properly handle failed kick_transfer

If dwc3 fails to issue START_TRANSFER/UPDATE_TRANSFER command, then we
should properly end an active transfer and give back all the started
requests. However if it's for an isoc endpoint, the failure maybe due to
bus-expiry status. In this case, don't give back the requests and wait
for the next retry.
