atm: fix atm_dev refcnt leaks in atmtcp_remove_persistent

atmtcp_remove_persistent() invokes atm_dev_lookup(), which returns a
reference of atm_dev with increased refcount or NULL if fails.

The refcount leaks issues occur in two error handling paths. If
dev_data->persist is zero or PRIV(dev)->vcc isn't NULL, the function
returns 0 without decreasing the refcount kept by a local variable,
resulting in refcount leaks.

Fix the issue by adding atm_dev_put() before returning 0 both when
dev_data->persist is zero or PRIV(dev)->vcc isn't NULL.
