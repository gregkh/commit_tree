vfs: add faccessat2 syscall

POSIX defines faccessat() as having a fourth "flags" argument, while the
linux syscall doesn't have it.  Glibc tries to emulate AT_EACCESS and
AT_SYMLINK_NOFOLLOW, but AT_EACCESS emulation is broken.

Add a new faccessat(2) syscall with the added flags argument and implement
both flags.

The value of AT_EACCESS is defined in glibc headers to be the same as
AT_REMOVEDIR.  Use this value for the kernel interface as well, together
with the explanatory comment.

Also add AT_EMPTY_PATH support, which is not documented by POSIX, but can
be useful and is trivial to implement.
