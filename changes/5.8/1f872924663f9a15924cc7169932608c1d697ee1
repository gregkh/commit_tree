btrfs: reloc: refactor finishing part of upper linkage into finish_upper_links()

After handle_one_tree_backref(), all newly added (not cached) edges and
nodes have the following features:

- Only backref_edge::list[LOWER] is linked.
  This means, we can only iterate from botton to top, not the other
  direction.

- Newly added nodes are not added to cache rb_tree yet

So to finish the backref cache, we still need to finish the links and
add all nodes into backref cache rb_tree.

This patch will refactor the existing code into finish_upper_links(),
add more comments of each branch, and why we need to do all the work.
