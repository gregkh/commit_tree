staging: wfx: drop useless call to hif_set_rx_filter()

hif_set_rx_filter() apply changes on filter_prbreq and filter_bssid to
the hardware. Each time filter_prbreq and filter_bssid are changed,
hif_set_rx_filter() is called.

Currently, on extra call to hif_set_rx_filter() is made from
wfx_update_filtering(). This call is useless. Drop it.
