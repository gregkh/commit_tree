e1000e: Disable TSO for buffer overrun workaround

Commit b10effb92e27 ("e1000e: fix buffer overrun while the I219 is
processing DMA transactions") imposes roughly 30% performance penalty.

The commit log states that "Disabling TSO eliminates performance loss
for TCP traffic without a noticeable impact on CPU performance", so
let's disable TSO by default to regain the loss.
