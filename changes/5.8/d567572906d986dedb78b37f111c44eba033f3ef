nvme: unlink head after removing last namespace

The driver had been unlinking the namespace head from the subsystem's
list only after the last reference was released, and outside of the
list's subsys->lock protection.

There is no reason to track an empty head, so unlink the entry from the
subsystem's list when the last namespace using that head is removed and
with the mutex lock protecting the list update. The next namespace to
attach reusing the previous NSID will allocate a new head rather than
find the old head with mismatched identifiers.
