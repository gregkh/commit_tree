net: dsa: add GRO support via gro_cells

gro_cells lib is used by different encapsulating netdevices, such as
geneve, macsec, vxlan etc. to speed up decapsulated traffic processing.
CPU tag is a sort of "encapsulation", and we can use the same mechs to
greatly improve overall DSA performance.
skbs are passed to the GRO layer after removing CPU tags, so we don't
need any new packet offload types as it was firstly proposed by me in
the first GRO-over-DSA variant [1].

The size of struct gro_cells is sizeof(void *), so hot struct
dsa_slave_priv becomes only 4/8 bytes bigger, and all critical fields
remain in one 32-byte cacheline.
The other positive side effect is that drivers for network devices
that can be shipped as CPU ports of DSA-driven switches can now use
napi_gro_frags() to pass skbs to kernel. Packets built that way are
completely non-linear and are likely being dropped without GRO.

This was tested on to-be-mainlined-soon Ethernet driver that uses
napi_gro_frags(), and the overall performance was on par with the
variant from [1], sometimes even better due to minimal overhead.
net.core.gro_normal_batch tuning may help to push it to the limit
on particular setups and platforms.
