mlxsw: spectrum_flower: Forbid to insert flower rules in collision with matchall rules

On ingress, the matchall rules doing mirroring and sampling are offloaded
into hardware blocks that are processed before any flower rules.
On egress, the matchall mirroring rules are offloaded into hardware
block that is processed after all flower rules.

Therefore check the priorities of inserted flower rules against
existing matchall rules and ensure the correct ordering.
