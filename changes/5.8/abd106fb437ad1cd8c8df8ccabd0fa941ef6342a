powerpc/64s: machine check do not trace real-mode handler

Rather than notrace annotations throughout a significant part of the
machine check code across kernel/ pseries/ and powernv/ which can
easily be broken and is infrequently tested, use paca->ftrace_enabled
to blanket-disable tracing of the real-mode non-maskable handler.
