io_uring: fix ->work corruption with poll_add

req->work might be already initialised by the time it gets into
__io_arm_poll_handler(), which will corrupt it by using fields that are
in an union with req->work. Luckily, the only side effect is missing
put_creds(). Clean req->work before going there.
