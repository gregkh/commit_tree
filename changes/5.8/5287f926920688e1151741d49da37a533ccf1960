perf script: Add flamegraph.py script

This script works in tandem with d3-flame-graph to generate flame graphs
from perf. It supports two output formats: JSON and HTML (the default).
The HTML format will look for a standalone d3-flame-graph template file
in /usr/share/d3-flame-graph/d3-flamegraph-base.html and fill in the
collected stacks.

Usage:

    perf record -a -g -F 99 sleep 60
    perf script report flamegraph

Combined:

    perf script flamegraph -a -F 99 sleep 60

Committer testing:

Tested both with "PYTHON=python3" and with the default, that uses
python2-devel:

Complete set of instructions:

  $ mkdir /tmp/build/perf
  $ make PYTHON=python3 -C tools/perf O=/tmp/build/perf install-bin
  $ export PATH=~/bin:$PATH
  $ perf record -a -g -F 99 sleep 60
  $ perf script report flamegraph

Now go and open the generated flamegraph.html file in a browser.

At first this required building with PYTHON=python3, but after I
reported this Andreas was kind enough to send a patch making it work
with both python and python3.
