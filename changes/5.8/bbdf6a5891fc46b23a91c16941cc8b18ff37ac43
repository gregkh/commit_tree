drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: Move 8BPC limit for MST into nv50_mstc_get_modes()

This just limits the BPC for MST connectors to a maximum of 8 from
nv50_mstc_get_modes(), instead of doing so during
nv50_msto_atomic_check(). This doesn't introduce any functional changes
yet (other then userspace now lying about the max bpc, but we can't
support that yet anyway so meh). But, we'll need this in a moment so
that we can share mode validation between SST and MST which will fix
some real world issues.
