clk: renesas: cpg-mssr: Fix STBCR suspend/resume handling

On SoCs with Standby Control Registers (STBCRs) instead of Module Stop
Control Registers (MSTPCRs), the suspend handler saves the wrong
registers, and the resume handler prints the wrong register in an error
message.

Fortunately this cannot happen yet, as the suspend/resume code is used
on PSCI systems only, and systems with STBCRs (RZ/A1 and RZ/A2) do not
use PSCI.  Still, it is better to fix this, to avoid this becoming a
problem in the future.

Distinguish between STBCRs and MSTPCRs where needed.  Replace the
useless printing of the virtual register address in the resume error
message by printing the register index.
