dm zoned: allocate temporary superblock for tertiary devices

Checking the tertiary superblock just consists of validating UUIDs,
crcs, and the generation number; it doesn't have contents which would
be required during the actual operation.

So allocate a temporary superblock when checking tertiary devices to
avoid having to store it together with the 'real' superblocks.
