media: atomisp: sh_css_defs.h: get rid of build time dependencies

There are several #ifdefs checking for ISP version there. Some
of them are just two different ways to represent the same contants,
while 3 parameters are actually different, depending on the ISP
version.

Change the header in a way that it will be compatible with both
versions, and change dependent code to keep running, removing
ifdefs there only when possible.
