drm/ast: fix missing break in switch statement for format->cpp[0] case 4

Currently the switch statement for format->cpp[0] value 4 assigns
color_index which is never read again and then falls through to the
default case and returns. This looks like a missing break statement
bug. Fix this by adding a break statement.
