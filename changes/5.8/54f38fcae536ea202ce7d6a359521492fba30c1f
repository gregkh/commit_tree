media: docs: move uAPI book to userspace-api/media

Since 2017, there is an space reserved for userspace API,
created by changeset 1d596dee3862 ("docs: Create a user-space API guide").

As the media subsystem was one of the first subsystems to use
Sphinx, until this patch, we were keeping things on a separate
place.

Let's just use the new location, as having all uAPI altogether
will likely make things easier for developers.
