KVM: X86: TSCDEADLINE MSR emulation fastpath

This patch implements a fast path for emulation of writes to the TSCDEADLINE
MSR.  Besides shortcutting various housekeeping tasks in the vCPU loop,
the fast path can also deliver the timer interrupt directly without going
through KVM_REQ_PENDING_TIMER because it runs in vCPU context.
