staging: vt6656: formulate rspinf values into tables

Four tables can be extracted from RSPINF_A_* based on BB_TYPE_11A or
else being GB rates.

Preamble short or long tables from fixed size len of 14 for RSPINF_B rates.

Remove function vnt_calculate_ofdm_rate and replace with the tables
calling RSPINF_A and RSPINF_B separately.
