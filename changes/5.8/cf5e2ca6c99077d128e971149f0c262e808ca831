ext4: mballoc: refactor ext4_mb_discard_preallocations()

Implement ext4_mb_discard_preallocations_should_retry()
which we will need in later patches to add more logic
like check for sequence number match to see if we should
retry for block allocation or not.

There should be no functionality change in this patch.
