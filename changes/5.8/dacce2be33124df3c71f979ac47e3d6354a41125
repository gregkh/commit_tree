vmxnet3: add geneve and vxlan tunnel offload support

Vmxnet3 version 3 device supports checksum/TSO offload. Thus, vNIC to
pNIC traffic can leverage hardware checksum/TSO offloads. However,
vmxnet3 does not support checksum/TSO offload for Geneve/VXLAN
encapsulated packets. Thus, for a vNIC configured with an overlay, the
guest stack must first segment the inner packet, compute the inner
checksum for each segment and encapsulate each segment before
transmitting the packet via the vNIC. This results in significant
performance penalty.

This patch will enhance vmxnet3 to support Geneve/VXLAN TSO as well as
checksum offload.
