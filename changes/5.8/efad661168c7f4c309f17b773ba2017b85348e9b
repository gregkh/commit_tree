rtw88: coex: 8723d: set antanna control owner

Without setting antenna control owner, the WiFi could be disconnected if
the BT has traffic. Because the antenna is switched to BT side for its
traffic, and the WiFi will have no chance to transfer data. Set control
owner to prevent WiFi disconnect issue.
