net: hns3: fix return value error when query MAC link status fail

Currently, PF queries the MAC link status per second by calling
function hclge_get_mac_link_status(). It return the error code
when failed to send cmdq command to firmware. It's incorrect,
because this return value is used as the MAC link status, which
0 means link down, and none-zero means link up. So fixes it.
