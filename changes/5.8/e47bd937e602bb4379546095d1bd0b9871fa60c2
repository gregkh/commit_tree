clk: samsung: Mark top ISP and CAM clocks on Exynos542x as critical

The TOP 'aclk*_isp', 'aclk550_cam', 'gscl_wa' and 'gscl_wb' clocks must
be kept enabled all the time to allow proper access to power management
control for the ISP and CAM power domains. The last two clocks, although
related to GScaler device and GSCL power domain, provides also the
I_WRAP_CLK signal to MIPI CSIS0/1 devices, which are a part of CAM power
domain and are needed for proper power on/off sequence.

Currently there are no drivers for the devices, which are part of CAM and
ISP power domains yet. This patch only fixes the race between disabling
the unused power domains and disabling unused clocks, which randomly
resulted in the following error during boot:

Power domain CAM disable failed
Power domain ISP disable failed
