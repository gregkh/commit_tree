perf record: Add dummy event during system wide synthesis

During the processing of /proc during event synthesis new processes may
start. Add a dummy event if /proc is to be processed, to capture mmaps
for starting processes. This reuses the existing logic for
initial-delay.

v3 fixes the attr test of test-record-C0
v2 fixes the dummy event configuration and a branch stack issue.
