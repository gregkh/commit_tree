ALSA: hda/hdmi: improve debug traces for stream lookups

The HDMI codec driver has two debug traces printed from different
functions but with identical message content:

"HDMI: hinfo 000000006a6b84d9 not registered"

Fix this duplication and also add a bit more context in addition to raw
object pointer, to help analysis of kernel logs.
