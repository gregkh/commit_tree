selftests/bpf: Xdp_adjust_tail add grow tail tests

Extend BPF selftest xdp_adjust_tail with grow tail tests, which is added
as subtest's. The first grow test stays in same form as original shrink
test. The second grow test use the newer bpf_prog_test_run_xattr() calls,
and does extra checking of data contents.
