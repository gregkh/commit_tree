KVM: nVMX: Migrate the VMX-preemption timer

The hrtimer used to emulate the VMX-preemption timer must be pinned to
the same logical processor as the vCPU thread to be interrupted if we
want to have any hope of adhering to the architectural specification
of the VMX-preemption timer. Even with this change, the emulated
VMX-preemption timer VM-exit occasionally arrives too late.
