PCI: cadence: Remove "cdns,max-outbound-regions" DT property

"cdns,max-outbound-regions" device tree property provides the
maximum number of outbound regions supported by the Host PCIe
controller. However the outbound regions are configured based
on what is populated in the "ranges" DT property.

Avoid using two properties for configuring outbound regions and
use only "ranges" property instead.
