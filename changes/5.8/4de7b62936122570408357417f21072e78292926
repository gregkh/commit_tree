modpost: remove is_vmlinux() helper

Now that is_vmlinux() is called only in new_module(), we can inline
the function call.

modname is the basename with '.o' is stripped. No need to compare it
with 'vmlinux.o'.

vmlinux is always located at the current working directory. No need
to strip the directory path.
