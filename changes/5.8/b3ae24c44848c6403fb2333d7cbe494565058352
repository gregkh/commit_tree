firmware: xilinx: Add sysfs to set shutdown scope

The Linux shutdown functionality implemented via PSCI system_off does
not include an option to set a scope, i.e. which parts of the system to
shut down.

This patch creates sysfs that allows to set the shutdown scope for the
next shutdown request. When the next shutdown is performed, the platform
specific portion of PSCI-system_off can use the chosen shutdown scope.
