media: atomisp: get rid of a duplicated file

The contents of hive_isp_css_2401_irq_types_hrt.h and
hive_isp_css_common/irq_global.h are identical, except for
one unused enum:

On isp2401, this IRQ line has this name:

	hrt_isp_css_irq_is2401 = HIVE_GP_DEV_IRQ_ISP_PMEM_ERROR_BIT_ID,

While the same bit is named as:
	hrt_isp_css_irq_isp_pmem_error = HIVE_GP_DEV_IRQ_ISP_PMEM_ERROR_BIT_ID,

At the isp2400 version.

Remove one of them, in order to reduce the code differences
between those two versions.
