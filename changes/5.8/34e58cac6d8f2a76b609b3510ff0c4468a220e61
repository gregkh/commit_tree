mm: workingset: let cache workingset challenge anon

We activate cache refaults with reuse distances in pages smaller than the
size of the total cache.  This allows new pages with competitive access
frequencies to establish themselves, as well as challenge and potentially
displace pages on the active list that have gone cold.

However, that assumes that active cache can only replace other active
cache in a competition for the hottest memory.  This is not a great
default assumption.  The page cache might be thrashing while there are
enough completely cold and unused anonymous pages sitting around that we'd
only have to write to swap once to stop all IO from the cache.

Activate cache refaults when their reuse distance in pages is smaller than
the total userspace workingset, including anonymous pages.

Reclaim can still decide how to balance pressure among the two LRUs
depending on the IO situation.  Rotational drives will prefer avoiding
random IO from swap and go harder after cache.  But fundamentally, hot
cache should be able to compete with anon pages for a place in RAM.
