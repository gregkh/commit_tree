f2fs: compress: support lzo-rle compress algorithm

LZO-RLE extension (run length encoding) was introduced to improve
performance of LZO algorithm in scenario of data contains many zeros,
zram has changed to use this extended algorithm by default, this
patch adds to support this algorithm extension, to enable this
extension, it needs to enable F2FS_FS_LZO and F2FS_FS_LZORLE config,
and specifies "compress_algorithm=lzo-rle" mountoption.
