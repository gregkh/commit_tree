of: property: Fix create device links for all child-supplier dependencies

Upon adding a new device from a DT node, we scan its properties and its
children's properties in order to create a consumer/supplier
relationship between the device and the property provider.

That said, it's possible for some of the node's children to be disabled,
which will create links that'll never be fulfilled.

To get around this, use the for_each_available_child_of_node() function
instead of for_each_available_node() when iterating over the node's
children.
