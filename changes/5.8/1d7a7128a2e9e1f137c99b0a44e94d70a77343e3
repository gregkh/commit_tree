power: supply: core: fix memory leak in HWMON error path

In function power_supply_add_hwmon_sysfs(), psyhw->props is
allocated by bitmap_zalloc(). But this pointer is not deallocated
when devm_add_action fail,  which lead to a memory leak bug. To fix
this, we replace devm_add_action with devm_add_action_or_reset.
