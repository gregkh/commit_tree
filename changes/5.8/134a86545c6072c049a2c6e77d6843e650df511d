ntb: intel: add hw workaround for NTB BAR alignment

Add NTB_HWERR_BAR_ALIGN hw errata flag to work around issue where the
aligment for the XLAT base must be BAR size aligned rather than 4k page
aligned. On ICX platform, the XLAT base can be 4k page size aligned
rather than BAR size aligned unlike the previous gen Intel NTB. However,
a silicon errata prevented this from working as expected and a workaround
is introduced to resolve the issue.
