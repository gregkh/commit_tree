KVM: nVMX: check for required but missing VMCS12 in KVM_SET_NESTED_STATE

A missing VMCS12 was not causing -EINVAL (it was just read with
copy_from_user, so it is not a security issue, but it is still
wrong).  Test for VMCS12 validity and reject the nested state
if a VMCS12 is required but not present.
