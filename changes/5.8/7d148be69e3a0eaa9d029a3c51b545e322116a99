sched/fair: Optimize enqueue_task_fair()

enqueue_task_fair jumps to enqueue_throttle label when cfs_rq_of(se) is
throttled which means that se can't be NULL in such case and we can move
the label after the if (!se) statement. Futhermore, the latter can be
removed because se is always NULL when reaching this point.
