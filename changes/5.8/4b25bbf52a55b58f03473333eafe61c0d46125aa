bcache: pr_info() format clean up in bcache_device_init()

scripts/checkpatch.pl reports following warning for patch
("bcache: check and adjust logical block size for backing devices"),
    WARNING: quoted string split across lines
    #146: FILE: drivers/md/bcache/super.c:896:
    +  pr_info("%s: sb/logical block size (%u) greater than page size "
    +	       "(%lu) falling back to device logical block size (%u)",

There are two things to fix up,
- The kernel message print should be in a single line.
- pr_info() won't automatically add new line since v5.8, a '\n' should
  be added.

This patch just does the above cleanup in bcache_device_init().
