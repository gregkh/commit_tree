powerpc/fadump: Account for memory_limit while reserving memory

If the memory chunk found for reserving memory overshoots the memory
limit imposed, do not proceed with reserving memory. Default behavior
was this until commit 140777a3d8df ("powerpc/fadump: consider reserved
ranges while reserving memory") changed it unwittingly.
