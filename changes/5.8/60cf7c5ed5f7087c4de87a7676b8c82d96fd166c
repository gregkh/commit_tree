lockdown: Allow unprivileged users to see lockdown status

A number of userspace tools, such as systemtap, need a way to see the
current lockdown state so they can gracefully deal with the kernel being
locked down. The state is already exposed in
/sys/kernel/security/lockdown, but is only readable by root. Adjust the
permissions so unprivileged users can read the state.
