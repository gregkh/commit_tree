media: atomisp: get rid of non-Linux error codes

The atomisp driver has its own error codes under the
ia_css_err.h file. On several places, those got already
replaced by standard error codes, but there are still a
lot more to be fixed.

Let's get rid of all of those, mapping them into
the already-existing set of Linux error codes.
