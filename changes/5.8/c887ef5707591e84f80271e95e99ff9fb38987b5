powerpc/64s: Don't set FSCR bits in INIT_THREAD

Since the previous commit that saves the value of FSCR configured at
boot into init_task.thread.fscr, the static initialisation in
INIT_THREAD now no longer has any effect.

So remove it.

For non DT CPU features, the end result is the same, because
__init_FSCR() is called on all CPUs that have an FSCR (Power8,
Power9), and it sets FSCR_TAR & FSCR_EBB.
