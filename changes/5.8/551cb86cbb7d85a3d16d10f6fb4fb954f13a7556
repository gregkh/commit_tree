gpio: dwapb: Remove unneeded has_irq member in struct dwapb_port_property

has_irq member of struct dwapb_port_property is used only in one place,
so, make it local test instead and remove from the structure.
This local test is using memchr_inv() which is quite efficient in comparison
to the original loop and possible little overhead can be neglected.
