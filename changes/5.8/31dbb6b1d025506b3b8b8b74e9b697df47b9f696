irqchip/gic-v4.1: Use readx_poll_timeout_atomic() to fix sleep in atomic

readx_poll_timeout() can sleep if @sleep_us is specified by the caller,
and is therefore unsafe to be used inside the atomic context, which is
this case when we use it to poll the GICR_VPENDBASER.Dirty bit in
irq_set_vcpu_affinity() callback.

Let's convert to its atomic version instead which helps to get the v4.1
board back to life!
