USB: serial: ch341: add basis for quirk detection

A subset of CH341 devices does not support all features, namely the
prescaler is limited to a reduced precision and there is no support for
sending a RS232 break condition. This patch adds a detection function
which will be extended to set quirk flags as they're implemented.

The author's affected device has an imprint of "340" on the
turquoise-colored plug, but not all such devices appear to be affected.
