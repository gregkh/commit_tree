ASoC: fsl_asrc: Move common definition to fsl_asrc_common

There is a new ASRC included in i.MX serial platform, there
are some common definition can be shared with each other.
So move the common definition to a separate header file.

And add fsl_asrc_pair_priv and fsl_asrc_priv for
the variable specific for the module, which can be used
internally.
