mm/huge_memory.c: __split_huge_page() use atomic ClearPageDirty()

Swapping load on huge=always tmpfs (with khugepaged tuned up to be very
eager, but I'm not sure that is relevant) soon hung uninterruptibly,
waiting for page lock in shmem_getpage_gfp()'s find_lock_entry(), most
often when "cp -a" was trying to write to a smallish file.  Debug showed
that the page in question was not locked, and page->mapping NULL by now,
but page->index consistent with having been in a huge page before.

Reproduced in minutes on a 4.15 kernel, even with 4.17's 605ca5ede764
("mm/huge_memory.c: reorder operations in __split_huge_page_tail()") added
in; but took hours to reproduce on a 4.17 kernel (no idea why).

The culprit proved to be the __ClearPageDirty() on tails beyond i_size in
__split_huge_page(): the non-atomic __bitoperation may have been safe when
4.8's baa355fd3314 ("thp: file pages support for split_huge_page()")
introduced it, but liable to erase PageWaiters after 4.10's 62906027091f
("mm: add PageWaiters indicating tasks are waiting for a page bit").
