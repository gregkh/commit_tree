ceph: quota: update MDS when max_bytes is approaching

When we're reaching the ceph.quota.max_bytes limit, i.e., when writing
more than 1/16th of the space left in a quota realm, update the MDS with
the new file size.

This mirrors the fuse-client approach with commit 122c50315ed1 ("client:
Inform mds file size when approaching quota limit"), in the ceph git tree.
