vhost: return bool from *_access_ok() functions

Currently vhost *_access_ok() functions return int.  This is error-prone
because there are two popular conventions:

1. 0 means failure, 1 means success
2. -errno means failure, 0 means success

Although vhost mostly uses #1, it does not do so consistently.
umem_access_ok() uses #2.

This patch changes the return type from int to bool so that false means
failure and true means success.  This eliminates a potential source of
errors.
