net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: Release mutex between each statistics read

The PTP code needs low latency access to the PTP hardware timestamps.
Reading all the statistics in one go adds a lot of latency to the PTP
code. So take and release the reg_lock mutex for each individual
statistics, allowing the PTP thread jump in between.
