HID: i2c-hid: Fix resume issue on Raydium touchscreen device

When Rayd touchscreen resumed from S3, it issues too many errors like:
i2c_hid i2c-RAYD0001:00: i2c_hid_get_input: incomplete report (58/5442)

And all the report data are corrupted, touchscreen is unresponsive.

Fix this by re-sending report description command after resume.
Add device ID as a quirk.
