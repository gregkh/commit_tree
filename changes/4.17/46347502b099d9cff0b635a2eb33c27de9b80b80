Restructure kernel-doc.rst

I found the layout confusing with multiple introductions to what
kernel-doc is and how to use it.

I made the following changes:
 - Moved the 'Including kernel-doc comments' section to the end of
   the document -- we should explain what it *is* before we explain
   how to integrate it.
 - Moved the 'Recommendations' subsection to the top.  We want people
   to know what to document before telling them how to do it.
 - Rewrite the 'Writing kernel-doc comments' section, integrating
   the 'Recommendations' subsection and a paragraph from 'How to format
   kernel-doc comments'.
 - Remove the paragraph about the kernel-doc script; we're supposed to
   be teaching people how to use punctuation to write pretty documentation,
   not documenting the build tooling.
 - Split the 'Parameters and member arguments' section into 'Function
   parameters' and 'Members'.  Structure members are not commonly
   referred to as arguments.
 - Integrate the 'private:' and 'public:' tag descriptions into the
   'Members' section.
 - Move the 'In-line member documentation comments' subsection up to be
   with the 'Members' section.
