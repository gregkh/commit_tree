crypto: testmgr - add a new test case for CRC-T10DIF

In order to be able to test yield support under preempt, add a test
vector for CRC-T10DIF that is long enough to take multiple iterations
(and thus possible preemption between them) of the primary loop of the
accelerated x86 and arm64 implementations.
