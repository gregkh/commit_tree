firmware: arm_scmi: add initial support for performance protocol

The performance protocol is intended for the performance management of
group(s) of device(s) that run in the same performance domain. It
includes even the CPUs. A performance domain is defined by a set of
devices that always have to run at the same performance level.
For example, a set of CPUs that share a voltage domain, and have a
common frequency control, is said to be in the same performance domain.

The commands in this protocol provide functionality to describe the
protocol version, describe various attribute flags, set and get the
performance level of a domain. It also supports discovery of the list
of performance levels supported by a performance domain, and the
properties of each performance level.

This patch adds basic support for the performance protocol.
