scsi: core: use blk_mq_requeue_request in __scsi_queue_insert

In scsi core, __scsi_queue_insert should just put request back on the
queue and retry using the same command as before. However, for blk-mq,
scsi_mq_requeue_cmd is employed here which will unprepare the
request. To align with the semantics of __scsi_queue_insert, use
blk_mq_requeue_request with kick_requeue_list == true and put the
reference of scsi_device.
