nvme: lightnvm: add late setup of block size and metadata

The nvme driver sets up the size of the nvme namespace in two steps.
First it initializes the device with standard logical block and
metadata sizes, and then sets the correct logical block and metadata
size. Due to the OCSSD 2.0 specification relies on the namespace to
expose these sizes for correct initialization, let it be updated
appropriately on the LightNVM side as well.
