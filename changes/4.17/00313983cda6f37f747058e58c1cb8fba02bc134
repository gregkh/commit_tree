RDMA/nldev: provide detailed CM_ID information

Implement RDMA nldev netlink interface to get detailed CM_ID information.

Because cm_id's are attached to rdma devices in various work queue
contexts, the pid and task information at restrak_add() time is sometimes
not useful.  For example, an nvme/f host connection cm_id ends up being
bound to a device in a work queue context and the resulting pid at attach
time no longer exists after connection setup.  So instead we mark all
cm_id's created via the rdma_ucm as "user", and all others as "kernel".
This required tweaking the restrack code a little.  It also required
wrapping some rdma_cm functions to allow passing the module name string.
