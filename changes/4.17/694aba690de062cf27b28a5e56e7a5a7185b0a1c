ipv4: factorize sk_wmem_alloc updates done by __ip_append_data()

While testing my inet defrag changes, I found that the senders
could spend ~20% of cpu cycles in skb_set_owner_w() updating
sk->sk_wmem_alloc for every fragment they cook.

The solution to this problem is to use alloc_skb() instead
of sock_wmalloc() and manually perform a single sk_wmem_alloc change.

Similar change for IPv6 is provided in following patch.
