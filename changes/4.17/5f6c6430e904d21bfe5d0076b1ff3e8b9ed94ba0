firmware: arm_scmi: add initial support for clock protocol

The clock protocol is intended for management of clocks. It is used to
enable or disable clocks, and to set and get the clock rates. This
protocol provides commands to describe the protocol version, discover
various implementation specific attributes, describe a clock, enable
and disable a clock and get/set the rate of the clock synchronously or
asynchronously.

This patch adds initial support for the clock protocol.
