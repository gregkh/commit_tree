ARM: dts: sun8i: a33: Enable A33 internal audio codec on A33-OLinuXino

The A33-OLinuXino routes the SoC's headphone output to a headphone jack,
and the microphone input to a microphone jack. Power to the microphone
is provided by MBIAS.

This patch enables the various parts of the codec, and adds widgets and
routes for simple-card.

HBIAS is connected to the microphone jack as well, but in a manner that
is confusing and likely does not provide power. This part is left out
of this patch.
