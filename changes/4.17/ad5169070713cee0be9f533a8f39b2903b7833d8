drm/i915: Move the final intel_gpu_reset() to after declaring wedged

If we fail to reset the GPU (i915_reset()), we do one final
intel_gpu_reset() attempt as we mark the device wedged. The idea here is
even though the GPU has proven unreliable (and so we want to stop using
it for the time being), we don't want it spinning away in the background
whilst the driver idles so we try to reset it one more time. However, we
want to dump the i915_gem_set_wedged() debugging info before we do, so
that we can see the accurate state of the GPU when it failed.
