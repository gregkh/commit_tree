net: Fix one possible memleak in ip_setup_cork

It would allocate memory in this function when the cork->opt is NULL. But
the memory isn't freed if failed in the latter rt check, and return error
directly. It causes the memleak if its caller is ip_make_skb which also
doesn't free the cork->opt when meet a error.

Now move the rt check ahead to avoid the memleak.
