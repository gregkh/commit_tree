mlxsw: Handle config changes pertinent to SPAN

For some netdevices, for which mlxsw offloads mirroring, may have a
complex relationship between the declared intent and low-level
device configuration.

Trying to accurately track which changes might influence offloading
decisions is finicky and error-prone. Instead, this patch introduces a
function mlxsw_sp_span_entry_respin, which re-queries the configuration
anew and, if different, removes the existing offloads and installs new
ones.

Call this function strategically at event handlers that might influence
the mirroring configuration.
