btrfs: not a disk error if the bio_add_page fails

bio_add_page() can fail for logical reasons as from the bio_add_page()
comments:

/*
 * This will only fail if either bio->bi_vcnt == bio->bi_max_vecs or
 * it's a cloned bio.
 */

Here we have just allocated the bio, so both of those failures can't
occur. So drop the check. We can also drop the error stats for write
error.
