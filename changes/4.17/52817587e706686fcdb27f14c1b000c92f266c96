x86/cpufeatures: Disentangle SSBD enumeration

The SSBD enumeration is similarly to the other bits magically shared
between Intel and AMD though the mechanisms are different.

Make X86_FEATURE_SSBD synthetic and set it depending on the vendor specific
features or family dependent setup.

Change the Intel bit to X86_FEATURE_SPEC_CTRL_SSBD to denote that SSBD is
controlled via MSR_SPEC_CTRL and fix up the usage sites.
