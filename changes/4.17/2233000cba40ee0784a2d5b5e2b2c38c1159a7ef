net/ipv6: Move call_fib6_entry_notifiers up for route adds

Move call to call_fib6_entry_notifiers for new IPv6 routes to right
before the insertion into the FIB. At this point notifier handlers can
decide the fate of the new route with a clean path to delete the
potential new entry if the notifier returns non-0.
