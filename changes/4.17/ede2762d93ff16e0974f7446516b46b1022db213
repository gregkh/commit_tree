net: Make NETDEV_XXX commands enum { }

This patch is preparation to drop NETDEV_UNREGISTER_FINAL.
Since the cmd is used in usnic_ib_netdev_event_to_string()
to get cmd name, after plain removing NETDEV_UNREGISTER_FINAL
from everywhere, we'd have holes in event2str[] in this
function.

Instead of that, let's make NETDEV_XXX commands names
available for everyone, and to define netdev_cmd_to_name()
in the way we won't have to shaffle names after their
numbers are changed.
