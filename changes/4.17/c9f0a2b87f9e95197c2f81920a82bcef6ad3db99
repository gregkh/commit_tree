KVM: s390: Refactor host cmma and pfmfi interpretation controls

use_cmma in kvm_arch means that the KVM hypervisor is allowed to use
cmma, whereas use_cmma in the mm context means cmm has been used before.
Let's rename the context one to uses_cmm, as the vm does use
collaborative memory management but the host uses the cmm assist
(interpretation facility).

Also let's introduce use_pfmfi, so we can remove the pfmfi disablement
when we activate cmma and rather not activate it in the first place.
