dt-bindings: ARM: sunxi: Document A80 SoC secure SRAM usage by SMP hotplug

On the Allwinner A80 SoC the BROM supports hotplugging the primary core
(cpu0) by checking two 32bit values at a specific location within the
secure SRAM block. This region needs to be reserved and accessible to
the SMP code.

Document its usage.
