powerpc/rfi-flush: Differentiate enabled and patched flush types

Currently the rfi-flush messages print 'Using <type> flush' for all
enabled_flush_types, but that is not necessarily true -- as now the
fallback flush is always enabled on pseries, but the fixup function
overwrites its nop/branch slot with other flush types, if available.

So, replace the 'Using <type> flush' messages with '<type> flush is
available'.

Also, print the patched flush types in the fixup function, so users
can know what is (not) being used (e.g., the slower, fallback flush,
or no flush type at all if flush is disabled via the debugfs switch).
