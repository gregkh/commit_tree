perf/x86/pt, coresight: Clean up address filter structure

This is a cosmetic patch that deals with the address filter structure's
ambiguous fields 'filter' and 'range'. The former stands to mean that the
filter's *action* should be to filter the traces to its address range if
it's set or stop tracing if it's unset. This is confusing and hard on the
eyes, so this patch replaces it with 'action' enum. The 'range' field is
completely redundant (meaning that the filter is an address range as
opposed to a single address trigger), as we can use zero size to mean the
same thing.
