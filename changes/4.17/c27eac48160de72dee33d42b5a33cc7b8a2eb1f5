i40e: Enable ADq and create queue channel/s on VF

This patch enables ADq and creates queue channels on a VF. An ADq
enabled VF can have up to 4 VSIs and each one of them represents
a traffic class and this is termed as a queue channel. Each of these
VSIs can have up to 4 queues. This patch services the request for
enabling ADq and adds queue channel based on the TC mqprio info
provided by the user in the VF.

Initially a check is made to see if spoof check is OFF, if not ADq
will not be enabled. PF notifies VF for a reset in order to complete
the creation of ADq resources i.e. creation of additional VSIs and
allocation of queues as per TC information, all in the reset path.

Steps:
======
1. Turn off the spoof check
2. Enable ADq using tc mqprio command with or without rate limit.
3. Pass traffic.

Example:
========
% ip link set dev eth0 vf 0 spoofchk off
% tc qdisc add dev $iface root mqprio num_tc 4 map\
	0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 3 queues\
	4@0 4@4 4@8 4@8 hw 1 mode channel

Expected results:
=================
1. Total number of queues for the VF should be sum of queues of all TCs.
2. Traffic flow should be normal without errors.
