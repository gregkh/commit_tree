brcmfmac: move allocation of control rx buffer to brcmf_sdio_bus_preinit()

Allocate the control rx buffer needed for firmware control interface
during brcmf_sdio_bus_preinit(). This relies on common layer setting
struct brcmf_bus::maxctl during brcmf_attach(). By moving the allocation
we can move brcmf_attach() in subsequent change.
