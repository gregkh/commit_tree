net: socket: add __compat_sys_...msg() helpers; remove in-kernel calls to compat syscalls

Using the net-internal helpers __compat_sys_...msg() allows us to avoid
the internal calls to the compat_sys_...msg() syscalls.
compat_sys_recvmmsg() is handled in a different patch.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
