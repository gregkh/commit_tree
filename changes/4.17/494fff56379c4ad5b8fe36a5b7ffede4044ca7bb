ipmr, ip6mr: Make mfc_cache a common structure

mfc_cache and mfc6_cache are almost identical - the main difference is
in the origin/group addresses and comparison-key. Make a common
structure encapsulating most of the multicast routing logic  - mr_mfc
and convert both ipmr and ip6mr into using it.

For easy conversion [casting, in this case] mr_mfc has to be the first
field inside every multicast routing abstraction utilizing it.
