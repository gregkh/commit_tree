ext4: fix bitmap position validation

Currently in ext4_valid_block_bitmap() we expect the bitmap to be
positioned anywhere between 0 and s_blocksize clusters, but that's
wrong because the bitmap can be placed anywhere in the block group. This
causes false positives when validating bitmaps on perfectly valid file
system layouts. Fix it by checking whether the bitmap is within the group
boundary.

The problem can be reproduced using the following

mkfs -t ext3 -E stride=256 /dev/vdb1
mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/test
cd /mnt/test
wget https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/linux-4.16.3.tar.xz
tar xf linux-4.16.3.tar.xz

This will result in the warnings in the logs

EXT4-fs error (device vdb1): ext4_validate_block_bitmap:399: comm tar: bg 84: block 2774529: invalid block bitmap

[ Changed slightly for clarity and to not drop a overflow test -- TYT ]
