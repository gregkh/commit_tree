rxrpc: Fix firewall route keepalive

Fix the firewall route keepalive part of AF_RXRPC which is currently
function incorrectly by replying to VERSION REPLY packets from the server
with VERSION REQUEST packets.

Instead, send VERSION REPLY packets to the peers of service connections to
act as keep-alives 20s after the latest packet was transmitted to that
peer.

Also, just discard VERSION REPLY packets rather than replying to them.
