regmap: Don't use format_val in regmap_bulk_read

A bulk read can be implemented either through regmap_raw_read, or
by reading each register individually using regmap_read.  Both
regmap_read and regmap_bulk_read should return values in native
endian. In the individual case the current implementation calls
format_val to put the data into the output array, which can cause
endian issues. The regmap_read will have already converted the data
into native endian, if the hosts endian differs from the device then
format_val will switch the endian back again.

Rather than using format_val simply use the code that is called if
there is no format_val function. This code supports all cases except
24-bit but there don't appear to be any users of regmap_bulk_read for
24-bit. Additionally, it would have to be a big endian host for the
old code to actually function correctly anyway.
