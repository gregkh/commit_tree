staging: rtl8723bs: Rework 'struct _ODM_Per_Pkt_Info_' coding style.

Change the typedef'd 'struct _ODM_Per_Pkt_Info_' into
'struct odm_packet_info' and change the members to snake case in
order to meet the coding style guidelines.
Members:
* u8 DataRate            -> data_rate
* u8 StationID           -> station_id
* bool bPacketMatchBSSID -> bssid_match
* bool bPacketToSelf     -> to_self
* bool bPacketBeacon     -> is_beacon
* bool bToSelf           -> (removed because it isn't used)
