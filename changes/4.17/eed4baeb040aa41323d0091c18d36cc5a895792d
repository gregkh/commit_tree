mlxsw: spectrum: qdiscs: Support qdisc per tclass

Add the option to set a qdisc per tclass.  Match the qdisc to the tclass by
parent ID. Supported currently for sch_red only.
It allows offloading sch_prio as root qdisc and sch_red as its child.
(However, doing so might corrupt the stats for both parent and child.)
