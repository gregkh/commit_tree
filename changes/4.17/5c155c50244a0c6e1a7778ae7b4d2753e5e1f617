net: Convert ip6gre_net_ops

These pernet_operations are similar to bond_net_ops. Exit method
unregisters all net ip6gre devices, and it looks like another
pernet_operations are not interested in foreign net ip6gre list
or net_generic()->tunnels_wc. Init method registers net device.
So, it's possible to mark them async.
