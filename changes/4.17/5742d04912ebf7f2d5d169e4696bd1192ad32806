KVM: arm64: Slightly improve debug save/restore functions

The debug save/restore functions can be improved by using the has_vhe()
static key instead of the instruction alternative.  Using the static key
uses the same paradigm as we're going to use elsewhere, it makes the
code more readable, and it generates slightly better code (no
stack setups and function calls unless necessary).

We also use a static key on the restore path, because it will be
marginally faster than loading a value from memory.

Finally, we don't have to conditionally clear the debug dirty flag if
it's set, we can just clear it.
