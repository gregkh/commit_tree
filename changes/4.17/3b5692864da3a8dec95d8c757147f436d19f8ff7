perf cgroup: Make the cgroup name be const char *

The usual thing is for a constructor to allocate space for its members,
not to require that the caller pass a pre-allocated 'name' and then, at
its destructor, to free something not allocated by it.

Fix it by making cgroup__new() to receive a const char pointer, then
allocate cgroup->name that then can continue to be freed at
cgroup__delete(), balancing the alloc/free operations inside the cgroup
struct methods.

This eases calling evlist__findnew_cgroup() from the custom 'perf trace'
cgroup parser, that will only call parse_cgroups() when the '-G cgroup'
is passed on the command line after '-e event' entries, when it'll
behave just like 'perf stat' and 'perf record', i.e. the previous
parse_cgroup() users that mandate that -G only can come after a -e.
