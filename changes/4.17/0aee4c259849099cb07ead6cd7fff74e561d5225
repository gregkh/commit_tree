This was introduced by commit:
f84af33 sctp: factor out sctp_sendmsg_to_asoc from sctp_sendmsg

As the newly refactored function moved the wait_for_sndbuf call to a
point after the association was connected, allowing for peeloff events
to occur, which in turn caused wait_for_sndbuf to return -EPIPE which
was not caught by the logic that determines if an association should be
freed or not.

Fix it the easy way by returning the ordering of
sctp_primitive_ASSOCIATE and sctp_wait_for_sndbuf to the old order, to
ensure that EPIPE will not happen.

Tested by myself using the syzbot reproducers with positive results
