btrfs: remove dead create_space_info calls

Since commit 2be12ef79 (btrfs: Separate space_info create/update), we've
separated out the creation and updating of the space info structures.
That commit was a straightforward refactoring of the two parts of
update_space_info, but we can go a step further.  Since commits
c59021f84 (Btrfs: fix OOPS of empty filesystem after balance) and
b742bb82f (Btrfs: Link block groups of different raid types), we know
that the space_info structures will be created at mount and there will
only ever be, at most, three of them.

This patch cleans out the create_space_info calls after __find_space_info
returns NULL since __find_space_info *can't* return NULL.

The initial cause for reviewing this was the kobject_add calls from
create_space_info occuring in sites where fs-reclaim wasn't allowed.  Now
we are certain they occur only early in the mount process and are safe.
