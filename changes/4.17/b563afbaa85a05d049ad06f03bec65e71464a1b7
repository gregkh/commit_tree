cpufreq: mediatek: Don't validate the frequency table twice

The cpufreq core is already validating the CPU frequency table after
calling the ->init() callback of the cpufreq drivers and the drivers
don't need to do the same anymore. Though they need to set the
policy->freq_table field directly from the ->init() callback now.

Stop validating the frequency table from mediatek driver.
