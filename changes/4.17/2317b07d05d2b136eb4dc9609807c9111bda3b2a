s390: update sampling tag after task pid change

In a multi-threaded program any thread can call execve(). If this
is not done by the thread group leader, the de_thread() function
replaces the pid of the task that calls execve() with the pid of
thread group leader. If the task reaches user space again without
going over __switch_to() the sampling tag is still set to the old
pid.

Define the arch_setup_new_exec function to verify the task pid
and udpate the tag with LPP if it has changed.
