ASoC: rt5651: Move 2 functions higher up in rt5651.c

Move 2 functions higher up in rt5651.c, this is a preparation patch
to avoid needing forward declarations when moving over from a codec
private function to the standard snd_soc_component_set_jack().

This commit purely moves these 2 functions up, not a single line is
changed.
