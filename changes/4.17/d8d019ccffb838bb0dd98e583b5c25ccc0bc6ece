drm/amdgpu: Add KFD eviction fence

This fence is used by KFD to keep memory resident while user mode
queues are enabled. Trying to evict memory will trigger the
enable_signaling callback, which starts a KFD eviction, which
involves preempting user mode queues before signaling the fence.
There is one such fence per process.

v2:
* Grab a reference to mm_struct
* Dereference fence after NULL check
* Simplify fence release, no need to signal without anyone waiting
* Added signed-off-by Harish, who is the original author of this code

v3:
* update MAINTAINERS file
* change amd_kfd_ prefix to amdkfd_
* remove useless initialization of variable to NULL

v4:
* set amdkfd_fence_ops to be static
