crypto: testmgr - Fix incorrect values in PKCS#1 test vector

The RSA private key for the first form should have
version, prime1, prime2, exponent1, exponent2, coefficient
values 0.
With non-zero values for prime1,2, exponent 1,2 and coefficient
the Intel QAT driver will assume that values are provided for the
private key second form. This will result in signature verification
failures for modules where QAT device is present and the modules
are signed with rsa,sha256.
