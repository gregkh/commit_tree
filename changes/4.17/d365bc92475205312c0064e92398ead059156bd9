media: ov13858: Avoid possible null first frame

Previously, the sensor, with default settings, was outputting SOF without
data. This results in frame sync error on the receiver side.

Now, configure the sensor to output SOF with MIPI data for all frames. This
avoids possible null first frame on the bus.
