tuntap: fix use after free during release

After commit b196d88aba8a ("tun: fix use after free for ptr_ring") we
need clean up tx ring during release(). But unfortunately, it tries to
do the cleanup blindly after socket were destroyed which will lead
another use-after-free. Fix this by doing the cleanup before dropping
the last reference of the socket in __tun_detach().
