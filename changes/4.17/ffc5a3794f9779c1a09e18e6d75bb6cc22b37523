btrfs: add (the only possible) __exit annotation

Recently, the __init annotations have been added. There's unfortunatelly
only one case where we can add __exit, because most of the cleanup
helpers are also called from the __init phase.

As the __exit annotated functions get discarded completely for a
built-in code, we'd miss them from the init phase.
