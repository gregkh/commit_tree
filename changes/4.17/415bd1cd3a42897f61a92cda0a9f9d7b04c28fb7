x86/hyper-v: move definitions from TLFS to hyperv-tlfs.h

mshyperv.h now only contains fucntions/variables we define in kernel, all
definitions from TLFS should go to hyperv-tlfs.h.

'enum hv_cpuid_function' is removed as we already have this info in
hyperv-tlfs.h, code in mshyperv.c is adjusted accordingly.
