fs: add do_mknodat() helper and ksys_mknod() wrapper; remove in-kernel calls to syscall

Using the fs-internal do_mknodat() helper allows us to get rid of
fs-internal calls to the sys_mknodat() syscall.

Introducing the ksys_mknod() wrapper allows us to avoid the in-kernel
calls to sys_mknod() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function
is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses
the same calling convention as sys_mknod().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
