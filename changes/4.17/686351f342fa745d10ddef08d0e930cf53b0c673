serial: imx: simplify some conditions related to dma

Neither .dma_is_txing nor .dma_is_rxing can evaluate to true if
.dma_is_enabled evaluates to false:

The only function that sets .dma_is_txing to a non-zero value is
imx_dma_tx() which is only called if .dma_is_enabled is true. Same for
.dma_is_rxing and start_rx_dma(). And before .dma_is_enabled is set to 0
when imx_shutdown calls imx_disable_dma(), .dma_is_rxing and
.dma_is_txing are reset to zero before, too.

For this reason

	sport->dma_is_enabled && sport->dma_is_rxing

has the same value as

	sport->dma_is_rxing

which allows to simplify three if conditions.
