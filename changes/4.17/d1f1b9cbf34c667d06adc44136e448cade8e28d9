selftests: net: Introduce first PMTU test

One single test implemented so far: test_pmtu_vti6_exception
checks that the PMTU of a route exception, caused by a tunnel
exceeding the link layer MTU, is affected by administrative
changes of the tunnel MTU. Creation of the route exception is
checked too.
