net: Allow pernet_operations to be executed in parallel

This adds new pernet_operations::async flag to indicate operations,
which ->init(), ->exit() and ->exit_batch() methods are allowed
to be executed in parallel with the methods of any other pernet_operations.

When there are only asynchronous pernet_operations in the system,
net_mutex won't be taken for a net construction and destruction.

Also, remove BUG_ON(mutex_is_locked()) from net_assign_generic()
without replacing with the equivalent net_sem check, as there is
one more lockdep assert below.

v3: Add comment near net_mutex.
