drm/i915/pmu: Reconstruct active state on starting busy-stats

We have a hole in our busy-stat accounting if the pmu is enabled during
a long running batch, the pmu will not start accumulating busy-time
until the next context switch. This then fails tests that are only
sampling a single batch.

v2: Count each active port just once (context in/out events are only on
the first and last assignment to a port).
v3: Avoid hardcoding knowledge of 2 submission ports
