ARM: defconfig: Update Gemini defconfig

This updates the Gemini defconfig with a config that will bring
up most of the recently merged and updated devices to some
functional level:

- We enable high resolution timers (the right thing to do)
- Enable CMA for the framebuffer, and the new TVE200
  framebuffer driver and the Ilitek ILI9322 driver for
  graphics on the D-Link DIR-685. HIGHMEM support comes in
  as part of this.
- Enable networking and the new Cortina Gemini ethernet
  driver.
- Enable MDIO over GPIO and the Realtek PHY devices used on
  several of these systems.
- Enable I2C over GPIO and SPI over GPIO which is used on
  several of these devices.
- Enable the Thermal framework, GPIO fan control and LM75 sensor
  adding cooling on the D-Link DNS-313 with no userspace
  involved even if only the kernel is working, rock solid
  thermal for this platform.
- Enable JEDEC flash probing to support the Eon flash chip in
  D-Link DNS-313.
- Enable LED disk triggers for the NAS type devices.
