mtd: rawnand: gpmi: use core timings instead of an empirical derivation

GPMI driver timings derivation looks very empirical and does not use
the known timings that the core wants to use with the NAND chip, by
using local defined constants that have no special meaning from the
outside world.

Simplify the way all of this is computed and use the NAND core's SDR
timings.

Integrity of the reads/writes has been checked with nandbiterrs, speed
improvements with flash_speed on a Freescale i.MX6 DualLite/Solo SABRE
Automotive Board. Measures are below, variations of less than 150kiB/s
between tests are common and then not significant. Speeds using mode 5
are the same, while speeds using mode 0 are quite improved (+40/50%
from non-optimal computation).
