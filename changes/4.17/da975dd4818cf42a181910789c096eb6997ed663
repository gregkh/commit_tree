RISC-V: Support GOT_HI20/CALL_PLT relocation type in kernel module

For CALL_PLT, emit the plt entry only when offset is more than 32-bit.

For PCREL_LO12, it uses the location of corresponding HI20 to
get the address of external symbol. It should check the HI20 type
is the PCREL_HI20 or GOT_HI20, because sometime the location will
have two or more relocation types.
For example:
0:   00000797                auipc   a5,0x0
                     0: R_RISCV_ALIGN        *ABS*
                     0: R_RISCV_GOT_HI20     SYMBOL
4:   0007b783                ld      a5,0(a5) # 0 <SYMBOL>
                     4: R_RISCV_PCREL_LO12_I .L0
                     4: R_RISCV_RELAX        *ABS*
