media: rcar-vin: allocate a scratch buffer at stream start

Before starting a capture, allocate a scratch buffer which can be used
by the driver to give to the hardware if no buffers are available from
userspace. The buffer is not used in this patch but prepares for future
refactoring where the scratch buffer can be used to avoid the need to
fallback on single capture mode if userspace can't queue buffers as fast
as the VIN driver consumes them.
