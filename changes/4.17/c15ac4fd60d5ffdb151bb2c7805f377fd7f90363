riscv/ftrace: Add dynamic function tracer support

We now have dynamic ftrace with the following added items:

* ftrace_make_call, ftrace_make_nop (in kernel/ftrace.c)
  The two functions turn each recorded call site of filtered functions
  into a call to ftrace_caller or nops

* ftracce_update_ftrace_func (in kernel/ftrace.c)
  turns the nops at ftrace_call into a call to a generic entry for
  function tracers.

* ftrace_caller (in kernel/mcount-dyn.S)
  The entry where each _mcount call sites calls to once they are
  filtered to be traced.

Also, this patch fixes the semantic problems in mcount.S, which will be
treated as only a reference implementation once we have the dynamic
ftrace.
