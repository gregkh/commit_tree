bpf: sockmap sample support for bpf_msg_cork_bytes()

Add sample application support for the bpf_msg_cork_bytes helper. This
lets the user specify how many bytes each verdict should apply to.

Similar to apply_bytes() tests these can be run as a stand-alone test
when used without other options or inline with other tests by using
the txmsg_cork option along with any of the basic tests txmsg,
txmsg_redir, txmsg_drop.
