cpufreq: tegra186: Break after initialization is done for policy->cpu

There are two clusters (2 + 4 CPUs) on this platform and a separate
cpufreq policy is available for each of the CPUs. The loop in
tegra186_cpufreq_init() tries to find the structure for the right CPU
and finish initialization. But it is missing a `break` statement at the
end, which forces it to restart the loop even when the CPU already
matched and initialization is done.

Fix that by adding the missing `break` statement.
