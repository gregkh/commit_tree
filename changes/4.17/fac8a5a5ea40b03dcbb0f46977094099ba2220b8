ASoC: fsl_ssi: Fix mode setting when changing channel number

This is a partial revert (in a cleaner way) of commit ebf08ae3bc90
("ASoC: fsl_ssi: Keep ssi->i2s_net updated") to fix a regression
at test cases when switching between mono and stereo audio.

The problem is that ssi->i2s_net is initialized in set_dai_fmt()
only, while this set_dai_fmt() is only called during the dai-link
probe(). The original patch assumed set_dai_fmt() would be called
during every playback instance, so it failed at the overriding use
cases.

This patch adds the local variable i2s_net back to let regular use
cases still follow the mode settings from the set_dai_fmt().

Meanwhile, the original commit of keeping ssi->i2s_net updated was
to make set_tdm_slot() clean by checking the ssi->i2s_net directly
instead of reading SCR register. However, the change itself is not
necessary (or even harmful) because the set_tdm_slot() might fail
to check the slot number for Normal-Mode-None-Net settings while
mono audio cases still need 2 slots. So this patch can also fix it.
And it adds an extra line of comments to declare ssi->i2s_net does
not reflect the register value but merely the initial setting from
the set_dai_fmt().
