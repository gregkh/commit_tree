rxrpc: Fix error reception on AF_INET6 sockets

AF_RXRPC tries to turn on IP_RECVERR and IP_MTU_DISCOVER on the UDP socket
it just opened for communications with the outside world, regardless of the
type of socket.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work with an AF_INET6 socket.

Fix this by turning on IPV6_RECVERR and IPV6_MTU_DISCOVER instead if the
socket is of the AF_INET6 family.

Without this, kAFS server and address rotation doesn't work correctly
because the algorithm doesn't detect received network errors.
