tee: check shm references are consistent in offset/size

This change prevents userland from referencing TEE shared memory
outside the area initially allocated by its owner. Prior this change an
application could not reference or access memory it did not own but
it could reference memory not explicitly allocated by owner but still
allocated to the owner due to the memory allocation granule.
