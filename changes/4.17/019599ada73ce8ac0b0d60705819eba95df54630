btrfs: use reada direction enum instead of constant value in populate_free_space_tree

populate_free_space_tree calls function btrfs_search_slot_for_read with
parameter int find_higher = 1, it means that, if no exact match is
found, then use the next higher item.  So in function
populate_free_space_tree, use READA_FORWARD to read forward ahead.

This also changes the value from READA_BACK to READA_FORWARD, since
according to the logic, it should reada_for_search forward, not
backward.
