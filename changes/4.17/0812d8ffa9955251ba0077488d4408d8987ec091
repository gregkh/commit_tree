regmap: Format data for raw write in regmap_bulk_write

In the case were the bulk transaction is split up into smaller chunks
data is passed directly to regmap_raw_write. However regmap_bulk_write
uses data in host endian and regmap_raw_write expects data in device
endian. As such if the host and device differ in endian the wrong data
will be written to the device. Correct this issue using a similar
approach to the single raw write case below it, duplicate the data
into a new buffer and use parse_inplace to format the data correctly.
