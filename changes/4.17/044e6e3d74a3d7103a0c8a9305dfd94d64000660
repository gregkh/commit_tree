ext4: don't update checksum of new initialized bitmaps

When reading the inode or block allocation bitmap, if the bitmap needs
to be initialized, do not update the checksum in the block group
descriptor.  That's because we're not set up to journal those changes.
Instead, just set the verified bit on the bitmap block, so that it's
not necessary to validate the checksum.

When a block or inode allocation actually happens, at that point the
checksum will be calculated, and update of the bg descriptor block
will be properly journalled.
