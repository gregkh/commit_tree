tools: bpftool: partition basic-block for each function in the CFG

This patch partition basic-block for each function in the CFG. The
algorithm is simple, we identify basic-block head in a first traversal,
then second traversal to identify the tail.

We could build extended basic-block (EBB) in next steps. EBB could make the
graph more readable when the eBPF sequence is big.
