ubi: Fix error for write access

When opening a device with write access, ubiblock_open returns an error
code. Currently, this error code is -EPERM, but this is not the right
value.

The open function for other block devices returns -EROFS when opening
read-only devices with FMODE_WRITE set. When used with dm-verity, the
veritysetup userspace tool is expecting EROFS, and refuses to use the
ubiblock device.

Use -EROFS for ubiblock as well. As a result, veritysetup accepts the
ubiblock device as valid.
