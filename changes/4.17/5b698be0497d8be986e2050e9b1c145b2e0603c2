video: backlight: Add helpers to enable and disable backlight

Add helper functions backlight_enable and backlight_disable to
enable/disable a backlight device. These helper functions can
then be used by different drm and tinydrm drivers to avoid
repetition of code and also to enforce a uniform and consistent
way to enable/disable a backlight device.
