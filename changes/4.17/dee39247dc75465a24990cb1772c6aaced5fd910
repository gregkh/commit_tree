arm64: KVM: Allow mapping of vectors outside of the RAM region

We're now ready to map our vectors in weird and wonderful locations.
On enabling ARM64_HARDEN_EL2_VECTORS, a vector slot gets allocated
if this hasn't been already done via ARM64_HARDEN_BRANCH_PREDICTOR
and gets mapped outside of the normal RAM region, next to the
idmap.

That way, being able to obtain VBAR_EL2 doesn't reveal the mapping
of the rest of the hypervisor code.
