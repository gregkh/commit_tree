net: aquantia: Limit number of vectors to actually allocated irqs

Driver should use pci_alloc_irq_vectors return value to correct number
of allocated vectors and napi instances. Otherwise it'll panic later
in pci_irq_vector.

Driver also should allow more than one MSI vectors to be allocated.

Error return path from pci_alloc_irq_vectors is also fixed to revert
resources in a correct sequence when error happens.
