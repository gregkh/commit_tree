vga_switcheroo: Deduplicate power state tracking

If DRM drivers use runtime PM, they currently notify vga_switcheroo
whenever they ->runtime_suspend or ->runtime_resume to update
vga_switcheroo's internal power state tracking.

That's essentially a duplication of a functionality performed by the
PM core as it already tracks the GPU's power state and vga_switcheroo
can always query it.

Introduce a new internal helper vga_switcheroo_pwr_state() which does
just that if runtime PM is used, or falls back to vga_switcheroo's
internal power state tracking if manual power control is used.
Drop a redundant power state check in set_audio_state() while at it.

This removes one of the two purposes of the notification mechanism
implemented by vga_switcheroo_set_dynamic_switch().  The other one is
power management of the audio device and we'll remove that next.
