x86/microcode/intel: Save microcode patch unconditionally

save_mc_for_early() was a no-op on !CONFIG_HOTPLUG_CPU but the
generic_load_microcode() path saves the microcode patches it has found into
the cache of patches which is used for late loading too. Regardless of
whether CPU hotplug is used or not.

Make the saving unconditional so that late loading can find the proper
patch.
