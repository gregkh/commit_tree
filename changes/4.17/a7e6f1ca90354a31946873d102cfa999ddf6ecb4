arm64: signal: Force SIGKILL for unknown signals in force_signal_inject

For signals other than SIGKILL or those with siginfo_layout(signal, code)
== SIL_FAULT then force_signal_inject does not initialise the siginfo_t
properly. Since the signal number is determined solely by the caller,
simply WARN on unknown signals and force to SIGKILL.
