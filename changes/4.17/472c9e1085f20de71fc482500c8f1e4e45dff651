leaking_addresses: skip all /proc/PID except /proc/1

When the system is idle it is likely that most files under /proc/PID
will be identical for various processes.  Scanning _all_ the PIDs under
/proc is unnecessary and implies that we are thoroughly scanning /proc.
This is _not_ the case because there may be ways userspace can trigger
creation of /proc files that leak addresses but were not present during
a scan.  For these two reasons we should exclude all PID directories
under /proc except '1/'

Exclude all /proc/PID except /proc/1.
