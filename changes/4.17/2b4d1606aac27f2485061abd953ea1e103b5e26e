arm64: KVM: Dynamically patch the kernel/hyp VA mask

So far, we're using a complicated sequence of alternatives to
patch the kernel/hyp VA mask on non-VHE, and NOP out the
masking altogether when on VHE.

The newly introduced dynamic patching gives us the opportunity
to simplify that code by patching a single instruction with
the correct mask (instead of the mind bending cumulative masking
we have at the moment) or even a single NOP on VHE. This also
adds some initial code that will allow the patching callback
to switch to a more complex patching.
