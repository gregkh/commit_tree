media: vpss: fix annotations for vpss_regs_base2

Fix those warnings:

	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:510:25: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different address spaces)
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:510:25:    expected void volatile [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:510:25:    got unsigned int [usertype] *static [toplevel] [assigned] vpss_regs_base2
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:520:34: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different address spaces)
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:520:34:    expected unsigned int [usertype] *static [toplevel] [assigned] vpss_regs_base2
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:520:34:    got void [noderef] <asn:2>*
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:522:54: warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different address spaces)
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:522:54:    expected void volatile [noderef] <asn:2>*addr
	drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpss.c:522:54:    got unsigned int [usertype] *static [toplevel] [assigned] vpss_regs_base2

Weird enough, vpss_regs_base0 and vpss_regs_base1 were
properly annotated.
