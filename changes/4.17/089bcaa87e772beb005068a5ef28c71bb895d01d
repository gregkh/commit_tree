watchdog: renesas_wdt: Add restart handler

On iWave's boards iwg20d and iwg22d the only way to reboot the system is
by means of the watchdog.
This patch adds a restart handler to rwdt_ops, and also makes sure we
keep its priority to the lowest level, in order to not override other
more effective handlers.
