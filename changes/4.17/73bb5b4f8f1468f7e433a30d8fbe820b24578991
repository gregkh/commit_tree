tools: bpftool: factor out xlated dump related code into separate file

This patch factors out those code of dumping xlated eBPF instructions into
xlated_dumper.[h|c].

They are quite independent dumper functions, so better to be kept
separately.

New dumper support will be added in later patches in this set.
