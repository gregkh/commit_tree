ipc/util: Helpers for making the sysvipc operations pid namespace aware

Capture the pid namespace when /proc/sysvipc/msg /proc/sysvipc/shm
and /proc/sysvipc/sem are opened, and make it available through
the new helper ipc_seq_pid_ns.

This makes it possible to report the pids in these files in the
pid namespace of the opener of the files.

Implement ipc_update_pid.  A simple impline helper that will only update
a struct pid pointer if the new value does not equal the old value.  This
removes the need for wordy code sequences like:

	old = object->pid;
	object->pid = new;
	put_pid(old);

and

	old = object->pid;
	if (old != new) {
		object->pid = new;
		put_pid(old);
	}

Allowing the following to be written instead:

	ipc_update_pid(&object->pid, new);

Which is easier to read and ensures that the pid reference count is
not touched the old and the new values are the same.  Not touching
the reference count in this case is important to help avoid issues
like af_unix experienced, where multiple threads of the same
process managed to bounce the struct pid between cpu cache lines,
but updating the pids reference count.
