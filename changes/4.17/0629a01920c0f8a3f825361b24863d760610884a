arm: dts: mt7623: fix USB initialization fails on bananapi-r2

Fix that USB initialization fails as below runtime log is present during
booting on bananapi-r2 board by adding missing regulators the USB device
requires. Current regulators USB device uses are being updated with the
correct ones to reflect real configurations which are all from fixed
regulators rather than MT6323 one's output.

xhci-mtk 1a1c0000.usb: 1a1c0000.usb supply vbus not found, using dummy regulator
xhci-mtk 1a240000.usb: 1a240000.usb supply vbus not found, using dummy regulator
