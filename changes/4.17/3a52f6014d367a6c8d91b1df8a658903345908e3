powerpc/64s: Fix POWER9 DD2.2 and above in cputable features

The CPU_FTR_POWER9_DD2_1 flag is intended to be set for DD2.1 and
above (which is what the dt_cpu_ftrs setup does). Fix cputable for
DD2.2 to match.

This came about due to patches b5af4f279323 ("powerpc: Add CPU feature
bits for TM bug workarounds on POWER9 v2.2"), and 9e9626ed3a4a
("powerpc/64s: Fix POWER9 DD2.2 and above in DT CPU features") being
in-flight at once. The latter patch fixed dt_cpu_ftrs like this one
does. The former changed cputable to match dt_cpu_ftrs.
