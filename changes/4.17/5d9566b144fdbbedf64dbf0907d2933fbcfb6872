firmware: use helpers for setting up a temporary cache timeout

We only use the timeout for the firmware fallback mechanism
except for trying to set the timeout during the cache setup
for resume/suspend. For those cases, setting the timeout should
be a no-op, so just reflect this in code by adding helpers for it.

This change introduces no functional changes.
