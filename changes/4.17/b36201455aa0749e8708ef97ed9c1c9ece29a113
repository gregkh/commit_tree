net: sched: act: handle extack in tcf_generic_walker

This patch adds extack handling for a common used TC act function
"tcf_generic_walker()" to add an extack message on failures.
The tcf_generic_walker() function can fail if get a invalid command
different than DEL and GET. The naming "action" here is wrong, the
correct naming would be command.
