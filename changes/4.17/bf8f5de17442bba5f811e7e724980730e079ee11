MAINTAINERS: add myself as maintainer of AFFS

The AFFS filesystem is still in use by m68k community (Link #2), but as
there was no code activity and no maintainer, the filesystem appeared on
the list of candidates for staging/removal (Link #1).

I volunteer to act as a maintainer of AFFS to collect any fixes that
might show up and to guard fs/affs/ against another spring cleaning.
