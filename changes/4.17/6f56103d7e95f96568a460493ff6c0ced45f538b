drm/i915: Track the number of times we have woken the GPU up

By counting the number of times we have woken up, we have a very simple
means of defining an epoch, which will come in handy if we want to
perform deferred tasks at the end of an epoch (i.e. while we are going
to sleep) without imposing on the next activity cycle.

v2: No reason to specify precise number of bits here.
v3: Take Tvrtko's advice and reserve 0 as an invalid epoch.
