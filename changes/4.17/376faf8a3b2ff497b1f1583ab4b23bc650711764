drm/i915: Fix DPLCLKA_CFGCR0 bits for Port F.

Since when it got introduced with commit '555e38d27317
("drm/i915/cnl: DDI - PLL mapping")' the support for Port F
was wrong, because Port F bits are far from bits used
for A to E.

Since Port F is not used so far we don't need to propagate
Fixes back there.

v2: Reuse _SHIFT definition to avoid complicated duplication (DK).
