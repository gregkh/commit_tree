MIPS: ptrace: Expose FIR register through FP regset

Correct commit 7aeb753b5353 ("MIPS: Implement task_user_regset_view.")
and expose the FIR register using the unused 4 bytes at the end of the
NT_PRFPREG regset.  Without that register included clients cannot use
the PTRACE_GETREGSET request to retrieve the complete FPU register set
and have to resort to one of the older interfaces, either PTRACE_PEEKUSR
or PTRACE_GETFPREGS, to retrieve the missing piece of data.  Also the
register is irreversibly missing from core dumps.

This register is architecturally hardwired and read-only so the write
path does not matter.  Ignore data supplied on writes then.
