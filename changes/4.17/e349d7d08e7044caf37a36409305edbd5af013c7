i2c: xlp9xx: Handle NACK on DATA properly

In case we receive NACK on DATA we shouldn't be resetting the controller,
rather we should issue STOP command. This will terminate the current
transaction and -EIO is returned.

While at that handle the SMBus Quick Command properly.
We shouldn't be setting the XLP9XX_I2C_CMD_READ/WRITE for such
transactions.
