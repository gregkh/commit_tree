net: Convert default_device_ops

These pernet operations consist of exit() and exit_batch() methods.

default_device_exit() moves not-local and virtual devices to init_net.
There is nothing exciting, because this may happen in any time
on a working system, and rtnl_lock() and synchronize_net() protect
us from all cases of external dereference.

The same for default_device_exit_batch(). Similar unregisteration
may happen in any time on a system. Here several lists (like todo_list),
which are accessed under rtnl_lock(). After rtnl_unlock() and
netdev_run_todo() all the devices are flushed.
