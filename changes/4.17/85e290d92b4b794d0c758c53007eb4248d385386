drm/radeon: Fix PCIe lane width calculation

Two years ago I tried an AMD Radeon E8860 embedded GPU with the drm driver.
The dmesg output included driver warnings about an invalid PCIe lane width.
Tracking the problem back led to si_set_pcie_lane_width_in_smc().
The calculation of the lane widths via ATOM_PPLIB_PCIE_LINK_WIDTH_MASK and
ATOM_PPLIB_PCIE_LINK_WIDTH_SHIFT macros did not increment the resulting
value, per the comment in pptable.h ("lanes - 1"), and per usage elsewhere.
Applying the increment silenced the warnings.
The code has not changed since, so either my analysis was incorrect or the
bug has gone unnoticed. Hence submitting this as an RFC.
