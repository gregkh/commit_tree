slub: make struct kmem_cache_order_objects::x unsigned int

struct kmem_cache_order_objects is for mixing order and number of
objects, and orders aren't big enough to warrant 64-bit width.

Propagate unsignedness down so that everything fits.

!!! Patch assumes that "PAGE_SIZE << order" doesn't overflow. !!!
