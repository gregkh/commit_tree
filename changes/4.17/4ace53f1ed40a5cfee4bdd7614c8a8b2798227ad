sbitmap: use test_and_set_bit_lock()/clear_bit_unlock()

sbitmap_queue_get()/sbitmap_queue_clear() are used for
allocating/freeing a resource, so they should provide acquire/release
barrier semantics, respectively. sbitmap_get() currently contains a full
barrier, which is unnecessary, so use test_and_set_bit_lock() instead of
test_and_set_bit() (these are equivalent on x86_64). sbitmap_clear_bit()
does not imply any barriers, which is incorrect, as accesses of the
resource (e.g., request) could potentially get reordered to after the
clear_bit(). Introduce sbitmap_clear_bit_unlock() and use it for
sbitmap_queue_clear() (this only adds a compiler barrier on x86_64). The
other existing user of sbitmap_clear_bit() (the blk-mq software queue
pending map) is serialized through a spinlock and does not need this.
