I dug through this and I discovered that the error was caused by the
removal of struct shmid_kernel from shm.h when building on powerpc.
Except for observing the existence of "struct file *shm_file" in
struct shmid_kernel I have no clue why the structure move would cause
such a failure.  I suspect shm.h always needed the forward declaration
and someting had been confusing gcc into not issuing the warning. --EWB
