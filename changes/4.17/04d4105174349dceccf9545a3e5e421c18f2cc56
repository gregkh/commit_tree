i40e/i40evf: use SW variables for hang detection

The i40e_detect_recover_hung function uses the i40e_get_tx_pending
function to determine if there are packets stalled on the ring.
i40e_get_tx_pending calculates the pending packets using the head
writeback value and HW tail.  If the queue is stopped and we lose the
interrupt to update our next_to_clean then we a) won't get another
interrupt to clean because queue is stopped b) we won't catch the
problem with i40e_detect_recover_hung because the HW values look like
there's no packets waiting to be transmitted.  Using the SW values we
can catch the issue because next_to_clean will be out of sync with head
writeback.

This has the added benefit being less CPU intensive because we don't
need to reach into the hardware to get the values.
