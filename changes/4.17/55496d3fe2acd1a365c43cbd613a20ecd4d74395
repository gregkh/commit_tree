zorro: Set up z->dev.dma_mask for the DMA API

The generic DMA API uses dev->dma_mask to check the DMA addressable
memory bitmask, and warns if no mask is set or even allocated.

Set z->dev.dma_coherent_mask on Zorro bus scan, and make z->dev.dma_mask
to point to z->dev.dma_coherent_mask so device drivers that need DMA have
everything set up to avoid warnings from dma_alloc_coherent(). Drivers can
still use dma_set_mask_and_coherent() to explicitly set their DMA bit mask.
