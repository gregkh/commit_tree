IB/core: Fix deleting default GIDs when changing mac adddress

Before [1], When MAC address of the netdevice is changed, default GID is
supposed to get deleted and added back which affects the node and/or port
GUID in below sequence.

netdevice_event()
-> NETDEV_CHANGEADDR
   default_del_cmd()
      del_netdev_default_ips()
          bond_delete_netdev_default_gids()
              ib_cache_gid_set_default_gid()
                  ib_cache_gid_del()
   add_cmd()
   [..]

However, ib_cache_gid_del() was not getting invoked in non bonding
scenarios because event_ndev and rdma_ndev are same.
Therefore, fix such condition to ignore checking upper device when event
ndev and rdma_dev are same; similar to bond_set_netdev_default_gids().

Which this fix ib_cache_gid_del() is invoked correctly; however
ib_cache_gid_del() doesn't find the default GID for deletion because
find_gid() was given default_gid = false with
GID_ATTR_FIND_MASK_DEFAULT set.
But it was getting overwritten by ib_cache_gid_set_default_gid() later
on as part of add_cmd().
Therefore, mac address change used to work for default GID.

With refactor series [1], this incorrect behavior is detected.

Therefore,
when deleting default GID, set default_gid and set MASK flag.
when deleting IP based GID, clear default_gid and set MASK flag.
