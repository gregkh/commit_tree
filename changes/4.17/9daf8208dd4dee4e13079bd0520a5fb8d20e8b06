ice: Add support for switch filter programming

A VSI needs traffic directed towards it. This is done by programming
filter rules on the switch (embedded vSwitch) element in the hardware,
which connects the VSI to the ingress/egress port.

This patch introduces data structures and functions necessary to add
remove or update switch rules on the switch element. This is a pretty low
level function that is generic enough to add a whole range of filters.

This patch also introduces two top level functions ice_add_mac and
ice_remove mac which through a series of intermediate helper functions
eventually call ice_aq_sw_rules to add/delete simple MAC based filters.
It's worth noting that one invocation of ice_add_mac/ice_remove_mac
is capable of adding/deleting multiple MAC filters.

Also worth noting is the fact that the driver maintains a list of currently
active filters, so every filter addition/removal causes an update to this
list. This is done for a couple of reasons:

1) If two VSIs try to add the same filters, we need to detect it and do
   things a little differently (i.e. use VSI lists, described below) as
   the same filter can't be added more than once.

2) In the event of a hardware reset we can simply walk through this list
   and restore the filters.

VSI Lists:
In a multi-VSI situation, it's possible that multiple VSIs want to add the
same filter rule. For example, two VSIs that want to receive broadcast
traffic would both add a filter for destination MAC ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff.
This can become cumbersome to maintain and so this is handled using a
VSI list.

A VSI list is resource that can be allocated in the hardware using the
ice_aq_alloc_free_res admin queue command. Simply put, a VSI list can
be thought of as a subscription list containing a set of VSIs to which
the packet should be forwarded, should the filter match.

For example, if VSI-0 has already added a broadcast filter, and VSI-1
wants to do the same thing, the filter creation flow will detect this,
allocate a VSI list and update the switch rule so that broadcast traffic
will now be forwarded to the VSI list which contains VSI-0 and VSI-1.
