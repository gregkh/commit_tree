SMB3: Fix 3.11 encryption to Windows and handle encrypted smb3 tcon

Temporarily disable AES-GCM, as AES-CCM is only currently
enabled mechanism on client side.  This fixes SMB3.11
encrypted mounts to Windows.

Also the tree connect request itself should be encrypted if
requested encryption ("seal" on mount), in addition we should be
enabling encryption in 3.11 based on whether we got any valid
encryption ciphers back in negprot (the corresponding session flag is
not set as it is in 3.0 and 3.02)
