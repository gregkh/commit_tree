rtc: snvs: Fix usage of snvs_rtc_enable

commit 179a502f8c46 ("rtc: snvs: add Freescale rtc-snvs driver") introduces
the SNVS RTC driver with a function snvs_rtc_enable().

snvs_rtc_enable() can return an error on the enable path however this
driver does not currently trap that failure on the probe() path and
consequently if enabling the RTC fails we encounter a later error spinning
forever in rtc_write_sync_lp().

This patch fixes by parsing the result of rtc_write_sync_lp() and
propagating both in the probe and elsewhere. If the RTC doesn't start we
don't proceed loading the driver and don't get into this loop mess later
on.
