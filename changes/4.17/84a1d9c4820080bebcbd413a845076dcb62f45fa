net: ethtool: extend RXNFC API to support RSS spreading of filter matches

We use a two-step process to configure a filter with RSS spreading.  First,
 the RSS context is allocated and configured using ETHTOOL_SRSSH; this
 returns an identifier (rss_context) which can then be passed to subsequent
 invocations of ETHTOOL_SRXCLSRLINS to specify that the offset from the RSS
 indirection table lookup should be added to the queue number (ring_cookie)
 when delivering the packet.  Drivers for devices which can only use the
 indirection table entry directly (not add it to a base queue number)
 should reject rule insertions combining RSS with a nonzero ring_cookie.
