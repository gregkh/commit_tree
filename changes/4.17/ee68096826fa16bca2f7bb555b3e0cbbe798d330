ASoC: rt5651: Rewrite jack-type detection

We get the insertion event before the jack is fully inserted at which point
the second ring on a TRRS connector may short the 2nd ring and sleeve
contacts. Testing has shown that this short-circuit may happen as late
as 500ms after the insertion event, but it never lasts longer then 300ms.

This commit changes the detection algorithm to require 5 identical OVCD
values in a row at 100 ms intervals to fix the jack-type sometimes getting
mis-detected.
