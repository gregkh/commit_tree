net: thunderx: move filter register related macro into proper place

The ThunderX NIC has set of registers which allows to configure
filter policy for ingress packets. There are three possible regimes
of filtering multicasts, broadcasts and unicasts: accept all, reject all
and accept filter allowed only.

Current implementation has enum with all of them and two generic macro
for enabling filtering et all (CAM_ACCEPT) and enabling/disabling
broadcast packets, which also should be corrected in order to represent
register bits properly. All these values are private for driver and
there is no need to ‘publish’ them via header file.

This commit is to move filtering register manipulation values from
header file into source with explicit assignment of exact register
values to them to be used while register configuring.
