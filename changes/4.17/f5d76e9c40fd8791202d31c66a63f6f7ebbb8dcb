ALSA: usb-audio: More strict sanity checks for clock parsers

The sanity checks introduced for malformed descriptors loosely check
the given descriptor size, although the size greater than the defined
description is invalid.  It was due to a concern of any funky firmware
in the actual products.  But this doesn't look hitting, and any sane
products must have the defined descriptors.

So in this patch, we make the validators more strict, allowing only
with the defined descriptor sizes.  The value in clock selector
validator is corrected from 5 to 7 to count the two unlisted fields
after baCSourceID[].
