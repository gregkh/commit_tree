powerpc/64s: Default l1d_size to 64K in RFI fallback flush

If there is no d-cache-size property in the device tree, l1d_size could
be zero. We don't actually expect that to happen, it's only been seen
on mambo (simulator) in some configurations.

A zero-size l1d_size leads to the loop in the asm wrapping around to
2^64-1, and then walking off the end of the fallback area and
eventually causing a page fault which is fatal.

Just default to 64K which is correct on some CPUs, and sane enough to
not cause a crash on others.
