afs: Locally edit directory data for mkdir/create/unlink/...

Locally edit the contents of an AFS directory upon a successful inode
operation that modifies that directory (such as mkdir, create and unlink)
so that we can avoid the current practice of re-downloading the directory
after each change.

This is viable provided that the directory version number we get back from
the modifying RPC op is exactly incremented by 1 from what we had
previously.  The data in the directory contents is in a defined format that
we have to parse locally to perform lookups and readdir, so modifying isn't
a problem.

If the edit fails, we just clear the VALID flag on the directory and it
will be reloaded next time it is needed.
