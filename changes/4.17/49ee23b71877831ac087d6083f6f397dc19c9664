serial: samsung: Fix out-of-bounds access through serial port index

The s3c24xx_serial_ports[] array is indexed using a value derived from
the "serialN" alias in DT, or from an incrementing probe index, which
may lead to an out-of-bounds access.

Fix this by adding a range check.

Note that the array size is defined by a Kconfig symbol
(CONFIG_SERIAL_SAMSUNG_UARTS), so this can even be triggered using
a legitimate DTB or legitimate board code.
