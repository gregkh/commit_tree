bpf: Add bpf_verifier_vlog() and bpf_verifier_log_needed()

The BTF (BPF Type Format) verifier needs to reuse the current
BPF verifier log.  Hence, it requires the following changes:

(1) Expose log_write() in verifier.c for other users.
    Its name is renamed to bpf_verifier_vlog().

(2) The BTF verifier also needs to check
'log->level && log->ubuf && !bpf_verifier_log_full(log);'
independently outside of the current log_write().  It is
because the BTF verifier will do one-check before
making multiple calls to btf_verifier_vlog to log
the details of a type.

Hence, this check is also re-factored to a new function
bpf_verifier_log_needed().  Since it is re-factored,
we can check it before va_start() in the current
bpf_verifier_log_write() and verbose().
