fs: add kern_select() helper; remove in-kernel call to sys_select()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel call to the sys_umount()
syscall.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
