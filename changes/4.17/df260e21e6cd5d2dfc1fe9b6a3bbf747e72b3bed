fs: add ksys_truncate() wrapper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_truncate()

Using the ksys_truncate() wrapper allows us to get rid of in-kernel
calls to the sys_truncate() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this
function is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In
particular, it uses the same calling convention as sys_truncate().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
