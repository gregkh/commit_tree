net: Convert net_ns_ops methods

This patch starts to convert pernet_subsys, registered
from pure initcalls.

net_ns_ops::net_ns_net_init/net_ns_net_init, methods use only
ida_simple_* functions, which are not need a synchronization.
They are synchronized by idr subsystem.

So, net_ns_ops methods are able to be executed
in parallel with methods of other pernet operations.
