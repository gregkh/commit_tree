netfilter: nf_conntrack_sip: allow duplicate SDP expectations

Callum Sinclair reported SIP IP Phone errors that he tracked down to
such phones sending session descriptions for different media types but
with same port numbers.

The expect core will only 'refresh' existing expectation if it is
from same master AND same expectation class (media type).
As expectation class is different, we get an error.

The SIP connection tracking code will then

1). drop the SDP packet
2). if an rtp expectation was already installed successfully,
    error on rtcp expectation will cancel the rtp one.

Make the expect core report back to caller when the conflict is due
to different expectation class and have SIP tracker ignore soft-error.
