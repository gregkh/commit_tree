net: bridge: set min MTU on port events and allow user to set max

Recently the bridge was changed to automatically set maximum MTU on port
events (add/del/changemtu) when vlan filtering is enabled, but that
actually changes behaviour in a way which breaks some setups and can lead
to packet drops. In order to still allow that maximum to be set while being
compatible, we add the ability for the user to tune the bridge MTU up to
the maximum when vlan filtering is enabled, but that has to be done
explicitly and all port events (add/del/changemtu) lead to resetting that
MTU to the minimum as before.
