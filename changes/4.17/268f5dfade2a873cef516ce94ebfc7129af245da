net: hns3: fix for RSS configuration loss problem during reset

RSS configuration will be set to default value by hclge_rss_init_hw
during reset, which causes the RSS configuration loss problem.

This patch fixes it by setting the default value in
hclge_rss_init_cfg function, which will not be called in the reset
process.
