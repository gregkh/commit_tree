kconfig: rename silentoldconfig to syncconfig

As commit cedd55d49dee ("kconfig: Remove silentoldconfig from help
and docs; fix kconfig/conf's help") mentioned, 'silentoldconfig' is a
historical misnomer.  That commit removed it from help and docs since
it is an internal interface.  If so, it should be allowed to rename
it to something more intuitive.  'syncconfig' is the one I came up
with because it updates the .config if necessary, then synchronize
include/generated/autoconf.h and include/config/* with it.

You should not manually invoke 'silentoldcofig'.  Display warning if
used in case existing scripts are doing wrong.
