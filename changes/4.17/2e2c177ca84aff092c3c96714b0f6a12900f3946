ALSA: vmaster: Propagate slave error

In slave_update() of vmaster code ignores the error from the slave
get() callback and copies the values.  It's not only about the missing
error code but also that this may potentially lead to a leak of
uninitialized variables when the slave get() don't clear them.

This patch fixes slave_update() not to copy the potentially
uninitialized values when an error is returned from the slave get()
callback, and to propagate the error value properly.
