ktest: Use config-bisect.pl in ktest.pl

Reduce code duplication and take advantage of bisection logic
improvements by calling config-bisect.pl.

The output of make oldconfig is now copied directly to the desired file,
rather than doing assign_configs+save_config, in order to preserve the
ordering so that diffing the configs at the end will provide useful
output.
