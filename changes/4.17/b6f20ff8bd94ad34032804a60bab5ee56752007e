firmware: arm_scmi: add common infrastructure and support for base protocol

The base protocol describes the properties of the implementation and
provide generic error management. The base protocol provides commands
to describe protocol version, discover implementation specific
attributes and vendor/sub-vendor identification, list of protocols
implemented and the various agents are in the system including OSPM
and the platform. It also supports registering for notifications of
platform errors.

This protocol is mandatory. This patch adds support for the same along
with some basic infrastructure to add support for other protocols.
