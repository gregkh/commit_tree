random: always fill buffer in get_random_bytes_wait

In the unfortunate event that a developer fails to check the return
value of get_random_bytes_wait, or simply wants to make a "best effort"
attempt, for whatever that's worth, it's much better to still fill the
buffer with _something_ rather than catastrophically failing in the case
of an interruption. This is both a defense in depth measure against
inevitable programming bugs, as well as a means of making the API a bit
more useful.
