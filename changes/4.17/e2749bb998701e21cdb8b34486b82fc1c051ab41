reset: modify the way reset lookup works for board files

Commit 7af1bb19f1d7 ("reset: add support for non-DT systems")
introduced reset control lookup mechanism for boards that still use
board files.

The routine used to register lookup entries takes the corresponding
reset_controlled_dev structure as argument.

It's been determined however that for the first user of this new
interface - davinci psc driver - it will be easier to register the
lookup entries using the reset controller device name.

This patch changes the way lookup entries are added.
