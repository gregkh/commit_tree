cxgb4: Correct ntuple mask validation for hash filters

Earlier code of doing bitwise AND with field width bits was wrong.
Instead, simplify code to calculate ntuple_mask based on supplied
fields and then compare with mask configured in hw - which is the
correct and simpler way to validate ntuple mask.
