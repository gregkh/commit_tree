openrisc: Set CONFIG_MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER

arm has an optional MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER, which openrisc copied but didn't
make optional.  The multi irq handler infrastructure has been copied to
generic code selectable with a new config symbol. That symbol can be
selected by randconfig builds and can cause build breakage.

Introduce CONFIG_MULTI_IRQ_HANDLER as an intermediate step which prevents
the core config symbol from being selected. The openrisc local config
symbol will be removed once openrisc gets converted to the generic code.
