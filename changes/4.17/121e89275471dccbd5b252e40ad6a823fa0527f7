net/mlx5e: Refactor RQ XDP_TX indication

Make the xdp_xmit indication available for Striding RQ
by taking it out of the type-specific union.
This refactor is a preparation for a downstream patch that
adds XDP support over Striding RQ.
In addition, use a bitmap instead of a boolean for possible
future flags.
