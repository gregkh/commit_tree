time: hrtimer: Introduce hrtimer_next_event_without()

The next set of changes will need to compute the time to the next
hrtimer event over all hrtimers except for the scheduler tick one.

To that end introduce a new helper function,
hrtimer_next_event_without(), for computing the time until the next
hrtimer event over all timers except for one and modify the underlying
code in __hrtimer_next_event_base() to prepare it for being called by
that new function.

No intentional changes in functionality.
