nfs4: don't compare clientid in nfs4_wake_lock_waiter

The task is expected to sleep for a while here, and it's possible that
a new EXCHANGE_ID has occurred in the interim, and we were assigned a
new clientid. Since this is a per-client list, there isn't a lot of
value in vetting the clientid on the incoming request.
