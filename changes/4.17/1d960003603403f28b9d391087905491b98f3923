Input: stmfts - use async probe & suspend/resume to avoid 2s delay

Executing stmfts_power_on() function lasts over 2 seconds, what
significantly slows down the boot and resume processes if driver is
compiled in. Avoid this delay by forcing this driver to be probed
and suspended/resumed asynchronously.
