ASoC: rt5651: Remove "JD Power" dapm supply

Remove the "JD power" dapm supply which gets force-enabled once when
using jack-detect and never gets disabled again.

Since the PWR_JD_M bit simply needs to be always on when using jack-detect
there is no need to have it tracked by dapm, instead we can simply set it
to 1 once when initializing the jack-detection.
