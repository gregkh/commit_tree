lib: add testing module for UBSAN

This is a test module for UBSAN.  It triggers all undefined behaviors
that linux supports now, and detect them.

All test-cases have passed by compiling with gcc-5.5.0.

If use gcc-4.9.x, misaligned, out-of-bounds, object-size-mismatch will not
be detected.  Because gcc-4.9.x doesn't support them.
