tools: bpftool: generate .dot graph from CFG information

This patch let bpftool print .dot graph file into stdout.

This graph is generated by the following steps:

  - iterate through the function list.
  - generate basic-block(BB) definition for each BB in the function.
  - draw out edges to connect BBs.

This patch is the initial support, the layout and decoration of the .dot
graph could be improved.

Also, it will be useful if we could visualize some performance data from
static analysis.
