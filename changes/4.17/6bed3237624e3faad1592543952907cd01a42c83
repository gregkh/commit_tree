powerpc: use NMI IPI for smp_send_stop

Use the NMI IPI rather than smp_call_function for smp_send_stop.
Have stopped CPUs hard disable interrupts rather than just soft
disable.

This function is used in crash/panic/shutdown paths to bring other
CPUs down as quickly and reliably as possible, and minimizing their
potential to cause trouble.

Avoiding the Linux smp_call_function infrastructure and (if supported)
using true NMI IPIs makes this more robust.
