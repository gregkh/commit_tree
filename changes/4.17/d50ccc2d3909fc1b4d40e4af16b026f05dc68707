tipc: add 128-bit node identifier

We add a 128-bit node identity, as an alternative to the currently used
32-bit node address.

For the sake of compatibility and to minimize message header changes
we retain the existing 32-bit address field. When not set explicitly by
the user, this field will be filled with a hash value generated from the
much longer node identity, and be used as a shorthand value for the
latter.

We permit either the address or the identity to be set by configuration,
but not both, so when the address value is set by a legacy user the
corresponding 128-bit node identity is generated based on the that value.
