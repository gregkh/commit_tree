tcp_bbr: better deal with suboptimal GSO (II)

This is second part of dealing with suboptimal device gso parameters.
In first patch (350c9f484bde "tcp_bbr: better deal with suboptimal GSO")
we dealt with devices having low gso_max_segs

Some devices lower gso_max_size from 64KB to 16 KB (r8152 is an example)

In order to probe an optimal cwnd, we want BBR being not sensitive
to whatever GSO constraint a device can have.

This patch removes tso_segs_goal() CC callback in favor of
min_tso_segs() for CC wanting to override sysctl_tcp_min_tso_segs

Next patch will remove bbr->tso_segs_goal since it does not have
to be persistent.
