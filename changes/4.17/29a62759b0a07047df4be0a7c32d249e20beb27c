ARM: tegra: apalis/colibri: Use correct compatible for RTC

All Toradex Carrier Boards use a st,m41t0 compatible RTC. Compared to a
st,m41t00 this RTC has also an oscillator fail bit which allows to
detect when the RTC lost track of time.

Similar to commit c53bec16b150 ("ARM: dts: colibri/apalis: use correct
compatible for RTC") covering our NXP i.MX and Vybrid based modules.
