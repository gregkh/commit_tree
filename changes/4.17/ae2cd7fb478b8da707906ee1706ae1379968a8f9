cifs: smb2ops: Fix listxattr() when there are no EAs

As per listxattr(2):

       On success, a nonnegative number is returned indicating the size
       of the extended attribute name list.  On failure, -1 is returned
       and errno  is set appropriately.

In SMB1, when the server returns an empty EA list through a listxattr(),
it will correctly return 0 as there are no EAs for the given file.

However, in SMB2+, it returns -ENODATA in listxattr() which is wrong since
the request and response were sent successfully, although there's no actual
EA for the given file.

This patch fixes listxattr() for SMB2+ by returning 0 in cifs_listxattr()
when the server returns an empty list of EAs.
