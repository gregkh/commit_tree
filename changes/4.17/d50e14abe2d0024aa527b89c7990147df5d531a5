uapi: Fix SPDX tags for files referring to the 'OpenIB.org' license

Based on discussion with Kate Stewart this license is not a
BSD-2-Clause, but is now formally identified as Linux-OpenIB
by SPDX.

The key difference between the licenses is in the 'warranty'
paragraph.

if_infiniband.h refers to the 'OpenIB.org' license, but
does not include the text, instead it links to an obsolete
web site that contains a license that matches the BSD-2-Clause
SPX. There is no 'three clause' version of the OpenIB.org
license.
