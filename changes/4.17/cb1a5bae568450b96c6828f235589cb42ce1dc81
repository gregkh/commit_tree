mac80211_hwsim: add permanent mac address option for new radios

If simulation needs predictable permanent mac addresses of hwsim wireless
phy, this patch add the ability to create a new radio with a user defined
permanent mac address. Allowed mac addresses needs to be locally
administrated mac addresses (as also the former fixed 42:* and 02:* were).

To do not break the operation with legacy software using hwsim, the new
address is set twice. The problem here is, the netlink call backs use
wiphy->addresses[1] as identification of a radio and not the proposed
permanent address (wiphy->addresses[0]). This design decision is not
documented in the kernel repo, therefore this patch simply reproduces this,
but with the same address.
