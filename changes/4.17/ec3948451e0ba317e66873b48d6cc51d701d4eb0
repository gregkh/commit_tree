perf record: Remove misleading error suggestion

When perf record encounters an error setting up an event it suggests
to enable CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS. This is misleading because:

- Usually it is enabled (it is really hard to disable on x86)

- The problem is usually somewhere else, e.g. the CPU is not supported
or an invalid configuration has been used.

Remove the misleading suggestion.
