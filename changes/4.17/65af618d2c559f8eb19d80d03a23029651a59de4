of: Add missing I/O range exception for indirect-IO devices

There are some special ISA/LPC devices that work on a specific I/O range
where it is not correct to specify a 'ranges' property in the DTS parent
node as CPU addresses translated from DTS node are only for memory space on
some architectures, such as ARM64.  Without the parent 'ranges' property,
of_translate_address() returns an error.

Here we add special handling for this case.

During the OF address translation, some checking will be performed to
identify whether the device node is registered as indirect-IO.  If it is,
the I/O translation will be done in a different way from that one of PCI
MMIO.  In this way, the I/O 'reg' property of the special ISA/LPC devices
will be parsed correctly.
