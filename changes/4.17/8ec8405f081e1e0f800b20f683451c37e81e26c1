tracing: Add rcu dereference annotation for test func that touches filter->prog

A boot up test function update_pred_fn() dereferences filter->prog without
the proper rcu annotation.

To do this, we must also take the event_mutex first. Normally, this isn't
needed because this test function can not race with other use cases that
touch the event filters (it is disabled if any events are enabled).
