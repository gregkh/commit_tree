cfg80211: fix data type of sta_opmode_info parameter

Currently bw and smps_mode are u8 type value in sta_opmode_info
structure. This values filled in mac80211 from ieee80211_sta_rx_bandwidth
and ieee80211_smps_mode. These enum values are specific to mac80211 and
userspace/cfg80211 doesn't know about that. This will lead to incorrect
result/assumption by the user space application.
Change bw and smps_mode parameters to their respective enums in nl80211.
