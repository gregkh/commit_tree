sh_eth: fix TSU init on SH7734/R8A7740

It appears that the single port Ether controllers having TSU (like SH7734/
R8A7740) need the same kind of treating in sh_eth_tsu_init() as R7S72100
currently has -- they also don't have the TSU registers related e.g. to
passing the frames between ports. Add the 'sh_eth_cpu_data::dual_port'
flag and use it as a new criterion for taking a "short path" in the TSU
init sequence in order to avoid writing to the non-existent registers...
