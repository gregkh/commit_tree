ASoC: rt5651: Fix bias_level confusion

The rt5651_set_bias_level() function was turning everything off at
SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY, rather then at SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF, requiring the bias-
level to be raised to SND_SOC_BIAS_PREPARE before turning anything on.

This is not how the bias-levels are supposed to work, this commit fixes
this by turning everything off at the SND_SOC_BIAS_OFF level and enabling
the pwr-bits needed for minimum functionality at SND_SOC_BIAS_STANDBY.

This fixes the minimum set of pwr-bits not getting enabled when
force-enabling some dapm-supplies (e.g. for jack type detection),
which raises the bias-level to standby.
