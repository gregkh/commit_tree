of/Documentation: Specify local APIC ID in "reg"

Use the "reg" property to specify the processor's local APIC ID instead of
setting it to the CPU node index in Device Tree.

Local APIC ID is assigned by hardware and visible in the APIC ID register.
Some processor models allow APIC ID to be changed by software, but CPUID
instruction executed with %eax = 0x0b always returns the initial ID in %edx.

Local APIC ID does not match the node index in many systems.
