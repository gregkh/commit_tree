RDMA/cxgb4: release hw resources on device removal

The c4iw_rdev_close() logic was not releasing all the hw
resources (PBL and RQT memory) during the device removal
event (driver unload / system reboot). This can cause panic
in gen_pool_destroy().

The module remove function will wait for all the hw
resources to be released during the device removal event.

Fixes c12a67fe(iw_cxgb4: free EQ queue memory on last deref)
