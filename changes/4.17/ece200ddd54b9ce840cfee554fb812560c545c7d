sunrpc: Save remote presentation address in svc_xprt for trace events

TP_printk defines a format string that is passed to user space for
converting raw trace event records to something human-readable.

My user space's printf (Oracle Linux 7), however, does not have a
%pI format specifier. The result is that what is supposed to be an
IP address in the output of "trace-cmd report" is just a string that
says the field couldn't be displayed.

To fix this, adopt the same approach as the client: maintain a pre-
formated presentation address for occasions when %pI is not
available.

The location of the trace_svc_send trace point is adjusted so that
rqst->rq_xprt is not NULL when the trace event is recorded.
