genirq: Drop 5 #included header files from irq.h

<linux/irq.h> does not use nor need several of its #included files,
so drop those header files from irq.h.

<linux/irq.h> is currently #included in around 1135 C source files
(oops, I didn't count other header files that #include it), making it
the 29th most-used header file.

Build tested on i386 and x86_64 * (allnoconfig, tiny.config, defconfig,
allyesconfig, and allmodconfig) and x64_64 allmodconfig + SMP=disabled.
