net: aquantia: Regression on reset with 1.x firmware

On ASUS XG-C100C with 1.5.44 firmware a special mode called "dirty wake"
is active. With this mode when motherboard gets powered (but no poweron
happens yet), NIC automatically enables powersave link and watches
for WOL packet.
This normally allows to powerup the PC after AC power failures.

Not all motherboards or bios settings gives power to PCI slots,
so this mode is not enabled on all the hardware.

4.16 linux driver introduced full hardware reset sequence
This is required since before that we had no NIC hardware
reset implemented and there were side effects of "not clean start".

But this full reset is incompatible with "dirty wake" WOL feature
it keeps the PHY link in a special mode forever. As a consequence,
driver sees no link and no traffic.

To fix this we forcibly change FW state to idle state before doing
the full reset. This makes FW to restore link state.
