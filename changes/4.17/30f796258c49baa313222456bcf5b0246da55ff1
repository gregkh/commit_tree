ibmvnic: Do not reset CRQ for Mobility driver resets

When resetting the ibmvnic driver after a partition migration occurs
there is no requirement to do a reset of the main CRQ. The current
driver code does the required re-enable of the main CRQ, then does
a reset of the main CRQ later.

What we should be doing for a driver reset after a migration is to
re-enable the main CRQ, release all the sub-CRQs, and then allocate
new sub-CRQs after capability negotiation.

This patch updates the handling of mobility resets to do the proper
work and not reset the main CRQ. To do this the initialization/reset
of the main CRQ had to be moved out of the ibmvnic_init routine
and in to the ibmvnic_probe and do_reset routines.
