KVM: VMX: give unrestricted guest full control of CR3

Now CR3 is not forced to a host-controlled value when paging is
disabled in an unrestricted guest, CR3 load/store exiting can be
left disabled (for an unrestricted guest).  And because CR0.WP
and CR4.PAE/PSE are also not force to host-controlled values,
all of ept_update_paging_mode_cr0() is no longer needed, i.e.
skip ept_update_paging_mode_cr0() for an unrestricted guest.

Because MOV CR3 no longer exits when paging is disabled for an
unrestricted guest, vmx_decache_cr3() must always read GUEST_CR3
from the VMCS for an unrestricted guest.
