ipv6: route: dissect flow in input path if fib rules need it

Dissect flow in fwd path if fib rules require it. Controlled by
a flag to avoid penatly for the common case. Flag is set when fib
rules with sport, dport and proto match that require flow dissect
are installed. Also passes the dissected hash keys to the multipath
hash function when applicable to avoid dissecting the flow again.
icmp packets will continue to use inner header for hash
calculations (Thanks to Nikolay Aleksandrov for some review here).
