vfio-ccw: fence off transport mode

vfio-ccw only supports command mode for channel programs, not transport
mode. User space is supposed to already take care of that and pass us
command-mode ORBs only, but better make sure and return an error to
the caller instead of trying to process tcws as ccws.
