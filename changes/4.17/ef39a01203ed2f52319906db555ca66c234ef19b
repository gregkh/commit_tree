selftests: ftrace: Fix trigger extended error testcase

Previous testcase redirects echo-out into /dev/null
using "&>" as below

echo "trigger-command" >> trigger &> /dev/null

But this means redirecting both stdout and stderr into
/dev/null because it is same as below

echo "trigger-command" >> trigger > /dev/null 2>&1

So ">> trigger" redirects stdout to trigger file, but
next "> /dev/null" redirects stdout to /dev/null again
and the last "2>/&1" redirects stderr to stdout (/dev/null)

This fixes it by "2> /dev/null". And also, since it
must fail, add "!" to echo command.
