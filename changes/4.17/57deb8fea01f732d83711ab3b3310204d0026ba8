powerpc/wii: Don't rely on the reserved memory hack

Because the two memory blocks (usually called MEM1 and MEM2) are not
merged anymore, __request_region in kernel/resource.c will correctly
allow reserving regions in the physical address space between MEM1 and
MEM2, where many important peripherals are (GPIO, MMC, USB, ...).

A previous change to __ioremap_caller in arch/powerpc/mm/pgtable_32.c
ensures that multiple memblocks are properly considered in ioremap; this
makes it unnecessary to set __allow_ioremap_reserved.
