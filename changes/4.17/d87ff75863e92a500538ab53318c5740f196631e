btrfs: Handle error from btrfs_uuid_tree_rem call in _btrfs_ioctl_set_received_subvol

As with every function which deals with modifying the btree
btrfs_uuid_tree_rem can fail for any number of reasons (ie. EIO/ENOMEM).
Handle return error value from this function gracefully by aborting the
transaction.
