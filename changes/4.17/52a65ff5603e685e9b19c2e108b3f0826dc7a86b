genirq: Add missing SPDX identifiers

Add SPDX identifiers to files

 - which contain an explicit license boiler plate or reference

 - which do not contain a license reference and were not updated in the
   initial SPDX conversion because the license was deduced by the scanners
   via EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL as GPL2.0 only.

[ tglx: Moved adding identifiers from the patch which removes the
  	references/boilerplate ]
