bcache: use pr_info() to inform duplicated CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE set

It is possible that multiple I/O requests hits on failed cache device or
backing device, therefore it is quite common that CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE is
set already when a task tries to set the bit from bch_cache_set_error().
Currently the message "CACHE_SET_IO_DISABLE already set" is printed by
pr_warn(), which might mislead users to think a serious fault happens in
source code.

This patch uses pr_info() to print the information in such situation,
avoid extra worries. This information is helpful to understand bcache
behavior in cache device failures, so I still keep them in source code.
