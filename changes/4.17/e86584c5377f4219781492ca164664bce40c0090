drm: Use idr_init_base(1) when using id==0 for invalid

Use the new idr_init_base() function to create an IDR that knows id==0
is never allocated as it maps to an invalid identifier. By knowing that
id==0 is invalid, the IDR can start from id=1 instead avoiding the issue
of having to start each lookup from the zeroth leaf as id==0 is always
unused (and thus the tree-of-bitmaps indicate that is the first
available).
