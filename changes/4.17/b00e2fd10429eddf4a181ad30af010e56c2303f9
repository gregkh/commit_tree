staging: wilc1000: fix NULL pointer exception in host_int_parse_assoc_resp_info()

Commit fe014d4e6b55 (staging: wilc1000: free memory allocated for general info
message from firmware) introduced a bug by using wrong source address in
kmemdup(). 'conn_info.req_ies' is used for source address in kempdup()
instead of 'hif_drv->usr_conn_req.ies'.

This commit fixes the NULL pointer dereference issue in
host_int_parse_assoc_resp_info() by using the correct source address in
kmemdup().
