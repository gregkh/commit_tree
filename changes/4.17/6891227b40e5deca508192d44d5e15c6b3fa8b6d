ARM: dts: exynos: Cleanup power domain nodes in exynos3250.dtsi

Device nodes in device tree should use generic names, so rename
all existing power domains to "power-domain". To keep readable domain
names in debug logs, use label property, which has been introduce by
commit b13b2330aab5 ("soc: samsung: pm_domains: Read domain name from
the new label property");
