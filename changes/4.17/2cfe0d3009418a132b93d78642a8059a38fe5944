task_struct: only use anon struct under randstruct plugin

The original intent for always adding the anonymous struct in
task_struct was to make sure we had compiler coverage.

However, this caused pathological padding of 40 bytes at the start of
task_struct.  Instead, move the anonymous struct to being only used when
struct layout randomization is enabled.
