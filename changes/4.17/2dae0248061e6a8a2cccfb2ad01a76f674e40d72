fs: add do_readlinkat() helper; remove internal call to sys_readlinkat()

Using the do_readlinkat() helper removes an in-kernel call to the
sys_readlinkat() syscall.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
