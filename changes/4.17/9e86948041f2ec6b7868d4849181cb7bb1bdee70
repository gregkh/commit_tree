KVM: x86: VMX: Intercept #GP to support access to VMware backdoor ports

If KVM enable_vmware_backdoor module parameter is set,
the commit change VMX to now intercept #GP instead of being directly
deliviered from CPU to guest.

It is done to support access to VMware backdoor I/O ports
even if TSS I/O permission denies it.
In that case:
1. A #GP will be raised and intercepted.
2. #GP intercept handler will simulate I/O port access instruction.
3. I/O port access instruction simulation will allow access to VMware
backdoor ports specifically even if TSS I/O permission bitmap denies it.

Note that the above change introduce slight performance hit as now #GPs
are not deliviered directly from CPU to guest but instead
cause #VMExit and instruction emulation.
However, this behavior is introduced only when enable_vmware_backdoor
KVM module parameter is set.
