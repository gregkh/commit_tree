kbuild: move include/config/ksym/* to include/ksym/*

The idea of using fixdep was inspired by Kconfig, but autoksyms
belongs to a different group.  So, I want to move those touched
files under include/config/ksym/ to include/ksym/.

The directory include/ksym/ can be removed by 'make clean' because
it is meaningless for the external module building.
