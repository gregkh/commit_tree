pinctrl: sunrisepoint: Align GPIO number space with Windows

It turns out that the Windows GPIO driver for Sunrisepoint PCH-H uses
similar bank structure than it does for Cannon Lake with the exception
that here the bank size is always 24 pins. Starting from pad group E the
BIOS/Windows GPIO numbering does not match the hardware anymore but
instead there are gaps to make each pad group ("bank") consume exactly
24 pins. Because of this Linux does not use correct pins for
GpioIo/GpioIo resources exposed by the BIOS.

This patch aligns the GPIO number space with BIOS/Windows to make sure
the same numbering scheme is used in Linux as well following what we did
already for Intel Cannon Lake.
