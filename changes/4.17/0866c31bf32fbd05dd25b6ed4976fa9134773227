tools/kvm_stat: Don't use deprecated file()

$ python3 tools/kvm/kvm_stat/kvm_stat
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "tools/kvm/kvm_stat/kvm_stat", line 1668, in <module>
    main()
  File "tools/kvm/kvm_stat/kvm_stat", line 1639, in main
    assign_globals()
  File "tools/kvm/kvm_stat/kvm_stat", line 1618, in assign_globals
    for line in file('/proc/mounts'):
NameError: name 'file' is not defined

open() is the python3 way, and works on python2.6+
