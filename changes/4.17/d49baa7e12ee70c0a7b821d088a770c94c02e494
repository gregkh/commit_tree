net/smc: check for missing nlattrs in SMC_PNETID messages

It's possible to crash the kernel in several different ways by sending
messages to the SMC_PNETID generic netlink family that are missing the
expected attributes:

- Missing SMC_PNETID_NAME => null pointer dereference when comparing
  names.
- Missing SMC_PNETID_ETHNAME => null pointer dereference accessing
  smc_pnetentry::ndev.
- Missing SMC_PNETID_IBNAME => null pointer dereference accessing
  smc_pnetentry::smcibdev.
- Missing SMC_PNETID_IBPORT => out of bounds array access to
  smc_ib_device::pattr[-1].

Fix it by validating that all expected attributes are present and that
SMC_PNETID_IBPORT is nonzero.
