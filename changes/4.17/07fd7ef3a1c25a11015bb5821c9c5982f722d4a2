vfio/pci: Use endian neutral helpers

The iowriteXX/ioreadXX functions assume little endian hardware and
convert to little endian on a write and from little endian on a read.
We currently do our own explicit conversion to negate this.  Instead,
add some endian dependent defines to avoid all byte swaps.  There
should be no functional change other than big endian systems aren't
penalized with wasted swaps.
