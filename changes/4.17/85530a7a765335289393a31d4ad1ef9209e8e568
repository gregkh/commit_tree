arm64: dts: ls1088a: Move cpu_thermal out of bus node

Move cpu_thermal node from soc node to root node.

cpu_thermal node does not have any register properties and thus
shouldn't be placed on the bus.

This fixes the following build warnings with W=1:

arch/arm64/boot/dts/freescale/fsl-ls1088a-qds.dtb: Warning (simple_bus_reg): Node /soc/thermal-zones missing or empty reg/ranges property
