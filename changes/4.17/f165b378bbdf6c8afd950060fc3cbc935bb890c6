mm: uninitialized struct page poisoning sanity checking

During boot we poison struct page memory in order to ensure that no one
is accessing this memory until the struct pages are initialized in
__init_single_page().

This patch adds more scrutiny to this checking by making sure that flags
do not equal the poison pattern when they are accessed.  The pattern is
all ones.

Since node id is also stored in struct page, and may be accessed quite
early, we add this enforcement into page_to_nid() function as well.
Note, this is applicable only when NODE_NOT_IN_PAGE_FLAGS=n
