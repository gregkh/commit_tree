sfc: pass the correctly bogus filter_id to rps_may_expire_flow()

When we inserted an ARFS filter for ndo_rx_flow_steer(), we didn't know
 what the filter ID would be, so we just returned 0.  Thus, we must also
 pass 0 as the filter ID when calling rps_may_expire_flow() for it, and
 rely on the flow_id to identify what we're talking about.
