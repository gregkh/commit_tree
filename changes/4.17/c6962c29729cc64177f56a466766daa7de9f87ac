usb: typec: tcpm: Set USB role switch to device mode when configured as such

Setting the mux to MUX_NONE and the switch to USB_SWITCH_DISCONNECT when
the data-role is device is not correct. Plenty of devices support
operating as USB device through a (separate) USB device controller.

We really need 2 different versions of USB_SWITCH_CONNECT,
USB_SWITCH_CONNECT_HOST and USB_SWITCH_DEVICE. Rather then modifying the
tcpc_usb_switch enum for this, simply remove it and switch to the
usb_role enum which provides exactly this, this will save use needing to
convert betweent the 2 enums when calling an usb-role-switch driver later.

Besides switching to the usb_role type, this commit also actually sets the
mux to TYPEC_MUX_USB and the switch to USB_ROLE_DEVICE instead of setting
both to none when the data-role is device.

This commit also makes tcpm_reset_port() call tcpm_mux_set(port,
TYPEC_MUX_NONE, USB_ROLE_NONE) so that the mux and switch
do _not_ stay in their last mode after a detach.
