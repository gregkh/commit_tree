firmware: enable run time change of forcing fallback loader

Currently one requires to test four kernel configurations to test the
firmware API completely:

0)
  CONFIG_FW_LOADER=y

1)
  o CONFIG_FW_LOADER=y
  o CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER=y

2)
  o CONFIG_FW_LOADER=y
  o CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER=y
  o CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK=y

3) When CONFIG_FW_LOADER=m the built-in stuff is disabled, we have
   no current tests for this.

We can reduce the requirements to three kernel configurations by making
fw_config.force_sysfs_fallback a proc knob we flip on off. For kernels that
disable CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC this can also enable one to inspect if
CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER_FALLBACK was enabled at build time by checking
the proc value at boot time.
