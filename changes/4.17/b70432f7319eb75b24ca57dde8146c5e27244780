mroute*: Make mr_table a common struct

Following previous changes to ip6mr, mr_table and mr6_table are
basically the same [up to mr6_table having additional '6' suffixes to
its variable names].
Move the common structure definition into a common header; This
requires renaming all references in ip6mr to variables that had the
distinct suffix.
