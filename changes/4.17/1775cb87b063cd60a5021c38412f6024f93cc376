ima: Simplify ima_eventsig_init()

The "goto out" statement doesn't have any purpose since there's no cleanup
to be done when returning early, so remove it. This also makes the rc
variable unnecessary so remove it as well.

Also, the xattr_len and fmt variables are redundant so remove them as well.
