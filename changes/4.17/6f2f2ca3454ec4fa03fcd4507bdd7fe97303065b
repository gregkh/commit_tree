perf vendor events: Drop support for unused topic directories

Currently a topic subdirectory is supported in the pmu-events dir, in
the following sample structure: /arch/platform/subtopic/mysubtopic.json

Upto 256 levels of topic subdirectories are supported. So this means
that JSONs may be located in a topic dir as well as the platform dir.

This topic subdirectory causes problems if we want to add support for a
vendor dir in the pmu-events structure (in the form
arch/platform/vendor), in that we cannot differentiate between a vendor
dir and a topic dir.

Since the topic dir feature is not used, drop it so it does not block
adding vendor subdirectory support.
