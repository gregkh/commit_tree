staging: ks7010: Replace local capability constants with kernel constants.

This driver defined constants BSS_CAP_* to represent WLAN capability
codes; however, these constants are already defined in the header
'linux/ieee80211.h' as WLAN_CAPABILITY_*.  This change removes the locally
defined constants and substitutes the kernel's constants.
