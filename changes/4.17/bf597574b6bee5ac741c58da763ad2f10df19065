PCI: endpoint: BAR width should not depend on sizeof dma_addr_t

If a BAR supports 64-bit width or not depends on the hardware,
and should thus not depend on sizeof(dma_addr_t).

If a certain hardware doesn't support 64-bit BARs, its
epc->ops->set_bar() implementation should return -EINVAL
when PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64 is set.

We can't change pci_epc_set_bar() to only set
PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64 based on size, since if the user,
for some reason, wants to configure a BAR with a 64-bit width,
even though the BAR size is less than 4 GB, he should be able
to do that.

However, since pci-epf-test is simply a test and not an API,
we can set PCI_BASE_ADDRESS_MEM_TYPE_64 in pci-epf-test itself
only based on size.
