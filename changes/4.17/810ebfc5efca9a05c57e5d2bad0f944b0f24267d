gpio: pci-idio-16: Implement get_multiple callback

The ACCES I/O PCI-IDIO-16 series of devices provides 16
optically-isolated digital inputs accessed via two 8-bit ports. Since
eight input lines are acquired on a single port input read, the
PCI-IDIO-16 GPIO driver may improve multiple input reads by utilizing a
get_multiple callback. This patch implements the
idio_16_gpio_get_multiple function which serves as the respective
get_multiple callback.
