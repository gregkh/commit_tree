Bluetooth: hci_ll: Convert to use h4_recv_buf helper

The HCILL or eHCILL protocol from TI is actually an H:4 protocol with a
few extra events and thus can also use the h4_recv_buf helper. Instead
of open coding the same funtionality add the extra events to the packet
description table and use h4_recv_buf.
