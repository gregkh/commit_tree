perf annotate: Stop using a global config struct

For the TUI, that is interactive, its interesting to have a
configuration that one can go on changing and then when moving from one
symbol annotation to another symbol, the options set while browsing the
first symbol to be kept.

But since we're trying to make this code reusable by a --stdio
formatter, we better have a pointer in struct annotation and in the TUI
case set it to the global, but use something else for other cases, such
as --stdio2.
