PCI: aardvark: Fix logic in advk_pcie_{rd,wr}_conf()

The PCI configuration space read/write functions were special casing
the situation where PCI_SLOT(devfn) != 0, and returned
PCIBIOS_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND in this case.

However, while this is what is intended for the root bus, it is not
intended for the child busses, as it prevents discovering devices with
PCI_SLOT(x) != 0. Therefore, we return PCIBIOS_DEVICE_NOT_FOUND only
if we're on the root bus.
