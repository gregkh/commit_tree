arm64: fix undefined reference to 'printk'

The printk symbol was intended as a generic address that is always
exported, however that turned out to be false with CONFIG_PRINTK=n:

ERROR: "printk" [arch/arm64/kernel/arm64-reloc-test.ko] undefined!

This changes the references to memstart_addr, which should be there
regardless of configuration.
