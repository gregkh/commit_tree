arm64: dts: renesas: eagle: Override EtherAVB phy-mode

As the PHY interface installed on the Eagle board provides TX and RX
channels delays, make the "phy-mode" property a board-specific one,
meant to override the one specified in the SoC DTSI.

Follow up patches will reset the r8a77970 SoC DTSI to use "rgmii" mode
and let the board file override that.
