powerpc/mm/radix: Fix always false comparison against MMU_NO_CONTEXT

In commit 9690c1574268 ("powerpc/mm/radix: Fix always false comparison
against MMU_NO_CONTEXT") an issue was discovered where `mm->context.id` was
being truncated to an `unsigned int`, while the PID is actually an
`unsigned long`. Update the earlier patch by fixing one remaining
occurrence. Discovered during a compilation with W=1:

  arch/powerpc/mm/tlb-radix.c:702:19: error: comparison is always false due to limited range of data type [-Werror=type-limits]
