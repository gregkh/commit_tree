libnvdimm, of_pmem: workaround OF_NUMA=n build error

Stephen reports that an x86 allmodconfig build fails to build the
of_pmem driver due to a missing definition of of_node_to_nid(). That
helper is currently only exported in the OF_NUMA=y case. In other cases,
ppc and sparc, it is a weak symbol, and outside of those platforms it is
a static inline.

Until an OF_NUMA=n configuration can reliably support usage of
of_node_to_nid() in modules across architectures, mark this driver as
'bool' instead of 'tristate'.
