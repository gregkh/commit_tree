arm64: dts: ls1046a: add a dummy memory 'reg' property

The memory node in fsl-ls1046a.dtsi has no 'reg' property, and causes
the dtc warning below.

Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): Node /memory@80000000 has a unit name, but no reg property

Let's add a 'reg' property with dummy memory size, since bootloader will
need to fill the correct one per board memory configuration anyway.
