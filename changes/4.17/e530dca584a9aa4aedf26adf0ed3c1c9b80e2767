kernel: provide ksys_*() wrappers for syscalls called by kernel/uid16.c

Using these helpers allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to these
syscalls: sys_setregid(), sys_setgid(), sys_setreuid(), sys_setuid(),
sys_setresuid(), sys_setresgid(), sys_setfsuid(), and sys_setfsgid().

The ksys_ prefix denotes that these function are meant as a drop-in
replacement for the syscall. In particular, they use the same calling
convention.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
