perf/core: Store context switch out type in PERF_RECORD_SWITCH[_CPU_WIDE]

Store preempting context switch out event into Perf trace as a part of
PERF_RECORD_SWITCH[_CPU_WIDE] record.

Percentage of preempting and non-preempting context switches help
understanding the nature of workloads (CPU or IO bound) that are running
on a machine;

The event is treated as preemption one when task->state value of the
thread being switched out is TASK_RUNNING. Event type encoding is
implemented using PERF_RECORD_MISC_SWITCH_OUT_PREEMPT bit;
