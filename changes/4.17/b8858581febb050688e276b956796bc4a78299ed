powerpc/lib: Fix off-by-one in alternate feature patching

When we patch an alternate feature section, we have to adjust any
relative branches that branch out of the alternate section.

But currently we have a bug if we have a branch that points to past
the last instruction of the alternate section, eg:

  FTR_SECTION_ELSE
  1:     b       2f
         or      6,6,6
  2:
  ALT_FTR_SECTION_END(...)
         nop

This will result in a relative branch at 1 with a target that equals
the end of the alternate section.

That branch does not need adjusting when it's moved to the non-else
location. Currently we do adjust it, resulting in a branch that goes
off into the link-time location of the else section, which is junk.

The fix is to not patch branches that have a target == end of the
alternate section.
