ecryptfs: lookup: Don't check if mount_crypt_stat is NULL

mount_crypt_stat is assigned to
&ecryptfs_superblock_to_private(ecryptfs_dentry->d_sb)->mount_crypt_stat,
and mount_crypt_stat is not the first object in struct ecryptfs_sb_info.
mount_crypt_stat is therefore never NULL. At the same time, no crash
in ecryptfs_lookup() has been reported, and the lookup functions in
other file systems don't check if d_sb is NULL either.
Given that, remove the NULL check.
