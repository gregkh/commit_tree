ARM: OMAP2+: Enable ti-sysc to use device tree data for smartreflex

Let's enable ti-sysc probing of child devices. So far we have only used
ti-sysc to probe interconnect target modules to idle them for cases where
the SoC does not have any child devices configured for the module, such
as smartreflex on dra7.

As we have smartreflex driver configured in the device tree for some SoCs,
we need to flip things on with a single patch to prevent both omap_device
and ti-sysc to probe smartreflex. So let's stop probing smartreflex with
omap_device and probe it with ti-sysc by enabling passing the auxdata.
