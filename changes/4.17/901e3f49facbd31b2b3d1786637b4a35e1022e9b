s390/qeth: avoid control IO completion stalls

For control IO, qeth currently tracks the index of the buffer that it
expects to complete the next IO on each qeth_channel. If the channel
presents an IRQ while this buffer has not yet completed, no completion
processing for _any_ completed buffer takes place.
So if the 'next buffer' is skipped for any sort of reason* (eg. when it
is released due to error conditions, before the IO is started), the
buffer obviously won't switch to PROCESSED until it is eventually
allocated for a _different_ IO and completes.
Until this happens, all completion processing on that channel stalls
and pending requests possibly time out.

As a fix, remove the whole 'next buffer' logic and simply process any
IO buffer right when it completes. A channel will never have more than
one IO pending, so there's no risk of processing out-of-sequence.

*Note: currently just one location in the code really handles this problem,
       by advancing the 'next' index manually.
