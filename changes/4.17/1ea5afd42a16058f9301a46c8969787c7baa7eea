Documentation: arch-support: remove obsolete architectures

A number of architecture ports are obsolete and getting dropped,
so we no longer want to track the respective features.

We already removed the lines for metag and mn10300, this does
the same edits for all the others.

For the remaining 21 architectures, this shows how many are known
to implement each given feature:

need to be added.
