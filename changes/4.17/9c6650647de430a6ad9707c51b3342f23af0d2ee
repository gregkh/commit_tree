perf intel-pt: Tidy old_buffer handling in intel_pt_get_trace()

intel_pt_get_trace() fixes overlaps between the current buffer and the
previous buffer ('old_buffer').

However the previous buffer might not have had usable data (no PSB) so
the comparison must be made against the previous buffer that had usable
data.

Tidy that by keeping a pointer for that purpose in struct intel_pt_queue.
