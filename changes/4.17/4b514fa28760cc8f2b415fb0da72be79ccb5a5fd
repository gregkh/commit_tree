mmc: dw_mmc: update kernel-doc comments for dw_mci

cur_slot and num_slots has been removed from struct dw_mci in 42f989c002f2.
Unfortunately, inline documentation was not updated so far.

Fix @lock field documentation in Locking section.
Move @mrq field of struct dw_mci_slot mention closer to it
description, so no one could miss this slightest detail.

Couple of code style fixes as a bonus.
