brcmfmac: allocate struct brcmf_pub instance using wiphy_new()

Rework the driver so the wiphy instance holds the main driver information
in its private buffer. Previously it held struct brcmf_cfg80211_info
instance so a bit of reorg was needed. This was done so that the wiphy
name or its parent device can be shown in debug output.
