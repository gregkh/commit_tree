debugobjects: Use global free list in free_object()

The newly added global free list allows to avoid lengthy pool_list
iterations in free_obj_work() by putting objects either into the pool list
when the fill level of the pool is below the maximum or by putting them on
the global free list immediately.

As the pool is now guaranteed to never exceed the maximum fill level this
allows to remove the batch removal from pool list in free_obj_work().

Split free_object() into two parts, so the actual queueing function can be
reused without invoking schedule_work() on every invocation.
