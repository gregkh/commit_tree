mlxsw: spectrum: Move SPAN code to separate module

For the upcoming work on SPAN, it makes sense to move the current code
to a module of its own. It already has a well-defined API boundary to
the mirror management (which is used from matchall and ACL code). A
couple more functions need to be exported for the functions that
spectrum.c needs to use for MTU handling and subsystem init/fini.
