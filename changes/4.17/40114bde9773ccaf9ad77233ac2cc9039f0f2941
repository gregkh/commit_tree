scsi: mpt3sas: Do not use 32-bit atomic request descriptor for Ventura controllers.

Sending I/O through 32 bit descriptors to Ventura series of controller
results in IO timeout on certain conditions. This error only occurs on
systems with high I/O activity.

Changes in this patch will prevent driver from using 32 bit descriptor
and use 64 bit Descriptors
