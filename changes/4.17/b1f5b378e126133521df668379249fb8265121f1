kthread: Allow kthread_park() on a parked kthread

The following commit:

  85f1abe0019f ("kthread, sched/wait: Fix kthread_parkme() completion issue")

added a WARN() in the case where we call kthread_park() on an already
parked thread, because the old code wasn't doing the right thing there
and it wasn't at all clear that would happen.

It turns out, this does in fact happen, so we have to deal with it.

Instead of potentially returning early, also wait for the completion.
This does however mean we have to use complete_all() and re-initialize
the completion on re-use.
