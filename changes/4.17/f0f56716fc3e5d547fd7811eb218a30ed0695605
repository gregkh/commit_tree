ata: ahci-platform: add reset control support

Add support to get and control a list of resets for the device
as optional and shared. These resets must be kept de-asserted until
the device is enabled.

This is specified as shared because some SoCs like UniPhier series
have common reset controls with all ahci controller instances.
