misc: aspeed-lpc-ctrl: Enable FWH and A2H bridge cycles

To date this driver has relied on prevous state from out of tree hacks
and vendor u-boot trees in order to have the host be able to access
data over the LPC bus.

Now we explicitly enable the AHB to LPC bridge and FWH cycles from when
the user first configures the address to map. We chose to do this then
as before that time there is no way for the kernel to know where it is
safe to point the LPC window.
