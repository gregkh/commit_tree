media: pci: cx88-input: use 64-bit arithmetic instead of 32-bit

Add suffix LL to constant 1000000 in order to give the compiler
complete information about the proper arithmetic to use. Notice
that this constant is used in a context that expects an expression
of type ktime_t (64 bits, signed).

The expression ir->polling * 1000000 is currently being evaluated
using 32-bit arithmetic.
