Input: libps2 - add debugging statements

Debugging via i8042.debug and analyzing raw PS/2 data stream may be
cumbersome as you need to locate the boundaries of commands, decipher the
sliced commands, etc, etc. Let's add a bit more high level debug statements
for ps2_sendbyte(), ps2_command(), and ps2_sliced_command().

We do not introduce a new module parameter, but rater rely on the kernel
having dynamic debug facility enabled (which most everyone has nowadays).
Enable with:

echo "file libps2.c +pf" > /sys/kernel/debug/dynamic_debug/control

or add "libps2.dyndbg=+pf" to the kernel command line.
