ext4: pass -ESHUTDOWN code to jbd2 layer

Previously the jbd2 layer assumed that a file system check would be
required after a journal abort.  In the case of the deliberate file
system shutdown, this should not be necessary.  Allow the jbd2 layer
to distinguish between these two cases by using the ESHUTDOWN errno.

Also add proper locking to __journal_abort_soft().
