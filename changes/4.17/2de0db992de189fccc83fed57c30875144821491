mm: use do_futex() instead of sys_futex() in mm_release()

sys_futex() is a wrapper to do_futex() which does not modify any
values here:

- uaddr, val and val3 are kept the same

- op is masked with FUTEX_CMD_MASK, but is always set to FUTEX_WAKE.
  Therefore, val2 is always 0.

- as utime is set to NULL, *timeout is NULL

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
