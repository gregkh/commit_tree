drm/sun4i: Add support for H3 HDMI PHY variant

While A83T HDMI PHY seems to be just customized Synopsys HDMI PHY, H3
HDMI PHY is completely custom PHY.

However, they still have many things in common like clock and reset
setup, setting sync polarity and more.

Add support for H3 HDMI PHY variant.

While documentation exists for this PHY variant, it doesn't go in great
details. Because of that, almost all settings are copied from BSP linux
4.4. Interestingly, those settings are slightly different to those found
in a older BSP with Linux 3.4. For now, no user visible difference was
found between them.
