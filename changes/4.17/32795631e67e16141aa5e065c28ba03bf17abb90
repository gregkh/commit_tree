MIPS: lantiq: gphy: Drop reboot/remove reset asserts

While doing a global software reset, these bits are not cleared and let
some bootloader fail to initialise the GPHYs. The bootloader don't
expect the GPHYs in reset, as they aren't during power on.

The asserts were a workaround for a wrong syscon-reboot mask. With a
mask set which includes the GPHY resets, these resets aren't required
any more.
