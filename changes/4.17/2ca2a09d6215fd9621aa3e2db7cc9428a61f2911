fs: add ksys_close() wrapper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_close()

Using the ksys_close() wrapper allows us to get rid of in-kernel calls
to the sys_close() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function
is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it
uses the same calling convention as sys_close(), with one subtle
difference:

The few places which checked the return value did not care about the return
value re-writing in sys_close(), so simply use a wrapper around
__close_fd().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
