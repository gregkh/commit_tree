sparc64: Add auxiliary vectors to report platform ADI properties

ADI feature on M7 and newer processors has three important properties
relevant to userspace apps using ADI capabilities - (1) Size of block of
memory an ADI version tag applies to, (2) Number of uppermost bits in
virtual address used to encode ADI tag, and (3) The value M7 processor
will force the ADI tags to if it detects uncorrectable error in an ADI
tagged cacheline. Kernel can retrieve these properties for a platform
through machine description provided by the firmware. This patch adds
code to retrieve these properties and report them to userspace through
auxiliary vectors.
