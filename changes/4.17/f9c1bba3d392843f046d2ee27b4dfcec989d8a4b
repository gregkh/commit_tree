afs: Fix afs_find_server search loop

The code that looks up servers by addresses makes the assumption
that the list of addresses for a server is sorted.  It exits the
loop if it finds that the target address is larger than the
current candidate.  As the list is not currently sorted, this
can lead to a failure to find a matching server, which can cause
callbacks from that server to be ignored.

Remove the early exit case so that the complete list is searched.
