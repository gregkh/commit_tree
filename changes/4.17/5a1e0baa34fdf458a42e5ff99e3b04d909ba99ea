PCI/MSI: Don't set up INTx if MSI or MSI-X is enabled

If MSI or MSI-X is enabled, the device uses that.  It uses INTx only if
both MSI and MSI-X are disabled (see PCIe r4.0, sec 7.7.1.2), so if a
device already has MSI or MSI-X enabled, there's no need to set up its
legacy INTx interrupt.

bba6f6fc68e7 ("[PATCH] MSI-X: fix resume crash") changed the cris, frv,
x86, and ia64 arches to skip INTx setup when MSI is enabled.  The cris and
frv arches have since been removed.

16cf0ebc35dd ("x86/PCI: Do not use interrupt links for devices using
MSI-X") extended that by changing x86 to also skip INTx setup when MSI-X is
enabled.

Change ia64 to skip INTx setup when either MSI or MSI-X is enabled by
applying the logic from 16cf0ebc35dd to ia64 as well as x86.
