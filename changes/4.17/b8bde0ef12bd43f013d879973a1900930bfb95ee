RISC-V: Add section of GOT.PLT for kernel module

Separate the function symbol address from .plt to .got.plt section.

The original plt entry has trampoline code with symbol address,
there is a 32-bit padding bwtween jar instruction and symbol address.

Extract the symbol address to .got.plt to reduce the module size.
