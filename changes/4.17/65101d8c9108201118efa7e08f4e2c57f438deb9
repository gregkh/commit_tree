drm/vc4: Expose performance counters to userspace

The V3D engine has various hardware counters which might be interesting
to userspace performance analysis tools.

Expose new ioctls to create/destroy a performance monitor object and
query the counter values of this perfmance monitor.

Note that a perfomance monitor is given an ID that is only valid on the
file descriptor it has been allocated from. A performance monitor can be
attached to a CL submission and the driver will enable HW counters for
this request and update the performance monitor values at the end of the
job.
