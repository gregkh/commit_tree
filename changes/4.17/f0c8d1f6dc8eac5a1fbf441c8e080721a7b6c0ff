iio: adc: at91-sama5d2_adc: fix channel configuration for differential channels

When iterating through the channels, the index in the array is not the
scan index. Added an xlate function to translate to the proper index.
The result of the bug is that the channel array is indexed with a wrong index,
thus instead of the proper channel, we access invalid memory, which may
lead to invalid results and/or corruption.
This will be used also for devicetree channel xlate.
