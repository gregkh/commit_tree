net: thunderx: add MAC address filter tracking for LMAC

The ThunderX NIC has two Ethernet Interfaces (BGX) each of them could has
up to four Logical MACs configured. Each of BGX has 32 filters to be
configured for filtering ingress packets. The number of filters available
to particular LMAC is from 8 (if we have four LMACs configured per BGX)
up to 32 (in case of only one LMAC is configured per BGX).

At the same time the NIC could present up to 128 VFs to OS as network
interfaces, each of them kernel will configure with set of MAC addresses
for filtering. So to prevent dupes in BGX filter registers from different
network interfaces it is required to cache and track all filter
configuration requests prior to applying them onto BGX filter registers.

This commit is to update LMAC structures with control fields to
allocate/releasing filters tracking list along with implementing
dmac array allocate/release per LMAC.
