net/mlx5e: Offload tc vlan push/pop using HW action

Currently, we are emulating the offload of vlan push/pop actions using
global setup as done by commit f5f82476090f ("net/mlx5: E-Switch, Support
VLAN actions in the offloads mode"). With newer NICs, we can apply a flow
action for that matter, do that while keeping the emulated path for the
older HW brands.
