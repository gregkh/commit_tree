perf annotate: Show group details on the title line

To match what is shown in the main 'perf report/top' title lines, i.e.
if a group is being shown, either a real group (recorded with "-e
'{a,b,c}') or a forced group (using 'perf report --group' for a
perf.data file recorded without {}) we will show multiple columns,
one per event, but we were failing to show the group details, so, for:

 # perf report --header-only | grep cmdline
 # cmdline : /home/acme/bin/perf record -e {cycles,instructions,cache-misses}
 # perf report --group

The first line was showing just "cycles", now it shows the correct line,
which is:

  Samples: 578  of events 'anon group { cycles, instructions, cache-misses }', 4000 Hz, Event count (approx.): 487421794
