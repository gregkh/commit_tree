mtd: Make sure the device supports erase operations in mtd_erase()

Some devices do not implement ->_erase() or have an invalid ->erasesize
value. In this case, mtd_erase() should return -ENOTSUPP.

Note that the test is not done on the MTD_NO_ERASE flag because this
flag means 'erasing a block before writing to it is unnecessary',
not 'the erase operation is not supported'. Actually, some drivers are
setting the MTD_NO_ERASE flag but still implementing the ->_erase()
hook and setting a valid ->erasesize value.
