arm64: KVM: Dynamically compute the HYP VA mask

As we're moving towards a much more dynamic way to compute our
HYP VA, let's express the mask in a slightly different way.

Instead of comparing the idmap position to the "low" VA mask,
we directly compute the mask by taking into account the idmap's
(VA_BIT-1) bit.

No functionnal change.
