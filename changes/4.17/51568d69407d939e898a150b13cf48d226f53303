virtio-net: re enable XDP_REDIRECT for mergeable buffer

XDP_REDIRECT support for mergeable buffer was removed since commit
7324f5399b06 ("virtio_net: disable XDP_REDIRECT in receive_mergeable()
case"). This is because we don't reserve enough tailroom for struct
skb_shared_info which breaks XDP assumption. So this patch fixes this
by reserving enough tailroom and using fixed size of rx buffer.
