ASoC: samsung: Mark unused Odroid compatibles as deprecated

Compatible for XU4 audio is not being used.  Instead the board uses the
same compatible as XU3.  The devices are now just compatible so they
should use the same value.  Mark "hardkernel,odroid-xu4-audio" as being
deprecated so in this future could be removed to limit useless
properties.

Additionally add older compatibles appearing in the bindings.
