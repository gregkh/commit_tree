NFSD: Clean up legacy NFS SYMLINK argument XDR decoders

Move common code in NFSD's legacy SYMLINK decoders into a helper.
The immediate benefits include:

 - one fewer data copies on transports that support DDP
 - consistent error checking across all versions
 - reduction of code duplication
 - support for both legal forms of SYMLINK requests on RDMA
   transports for all versions of NFS (in particular, NFSv2, for
   completeness)

In the long term, this helper is an appropriate spot to perform a
per-transport call-out to fill the pathname argument using, say,
RDMA Reads.

Filling the pathname in the proc function also means that eventually
the incoming filehandle can be interpreted so that filesystem-
specific memory can be allocated as a sink for the pathname
argument, rather than using anonymous pages.
