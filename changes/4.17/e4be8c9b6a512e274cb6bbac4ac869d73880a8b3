thunderbolt: Wait a bit longer for ICM to authenticate the active NVM

Sometimes during cold boot ICM has not yet authenticated the active NVM
image leading to timeout and failing the driver probe. Allow ICM to take
some more time and increase the timeout to 3 seconds before we give up.

While there fix icm_firmware_init() to return the real error code
without overwriting it with -ENODEV.
