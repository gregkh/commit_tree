perf annotate: Defer searching for comma in raw line till it is needed

That strchr() in jump__scnprintf() needs to be nuked somehow, as it,
IIRC is already done in jump__parse() and if needed at scnprintf() time,
should be stashed in the struct filled in parse() time.

For now jus defer it to just before where it is used.
