drm/i915/cnl: Sync PCI ID with Spec.

Add one missing PCI ID and sort them in a way
that gets easier to review and compare against spec's
table.

When trying to sync libdrm and mesa id list with kernel
and spec I noticed something was wrong and we were missing
a pci id. So to make our lives easier when checking against
spec let's simplify and sort like spec does.

BSpec: 13621
