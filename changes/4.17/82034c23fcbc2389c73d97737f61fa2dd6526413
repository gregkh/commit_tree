arm64: Make sure permission updates happen for pmd/pud

Commit 15122ee2c515 ("arm64: Enforce BBM for huge IO/VMAP mappings")
disallowed block mappings for ioremap since that code does not honor
break-before-make. The same APIs are also used for permission updating
though and the extra checks prevent the permission updates from happening,
even though this should be permitted. This results in read-only permissions
not being fully applied. Visibly, this can occasionaly be seen as a failure
on the built in rodata test when the test data ends up in a section or
as an odd RW gap on the page table dump. Fix this by using
pgattr_change_is_safe instead of p*d_present for determining if the
change is permitted.
