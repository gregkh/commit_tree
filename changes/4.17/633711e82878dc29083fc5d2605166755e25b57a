kvm: rename KVM_HINTS_DEDICATED to KVM_HINTS_REALTIME

KVM_HINTS_DEDICATED seems to be somewhat confusing:

Guest doesn't really care whether it's the only task running on a host
CPU as long as it's not preempted.

And there are more reasons for Guest to be preempted than host CPU
sharing, for example, with memory overcommit it can get preempted on a
memory access, post copy migration can cause preemption, etc.

Let's call it KVM_HINTS_REALTIME which seems to better
match what guests expect.

Also, the flag most be set on all vCPUs - current guests assume this.
Note so in the documentation.
