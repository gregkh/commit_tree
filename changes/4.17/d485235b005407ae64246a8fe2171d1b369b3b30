s390: assume diag308 set always works

diag308 set has been available for many machine generations, and
alternative reipl code paths has not been exercised and seems to be
broken without noticing for a while now. So, cleaning up all obsolete
reipl methods except currently used ones, assuming that diag308 set
always works.

Also removing not longer needed reset callbacks.
