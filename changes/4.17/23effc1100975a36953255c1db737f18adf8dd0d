drm/amdgpu: Handle 64-bit return from drm_crtc_vblank_count()

570e86963a51 ("drm: Widen vblank count to 64-bits [v3]") changed the
return type for drm_crtc_vblank_count() to u64. This could cause
potential problems if the return value is used in arithmetic operations
with a 32-bit reference HW vblank count. Explicitly typecasting this down
to u32 either fixes a potential problem or serves to add clarity in case
the typecasting was implicitly done.
