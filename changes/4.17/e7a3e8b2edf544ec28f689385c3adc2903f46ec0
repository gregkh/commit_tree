fs: add ksys_write() helper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_write()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the sys_write()
syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is meant as a drop-in
replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the same calling
convention as sys_write().

In the near future, the do_mounts / initramfs callers of ksys_write()
should be converted to use filp_open() and vfs_write() instead.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
