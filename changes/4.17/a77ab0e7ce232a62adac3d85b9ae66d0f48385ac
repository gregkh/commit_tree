parisc: Add code generator for Qemu/SeaBIOS machine info

Qemu now supports emulating PA-RISC machines. For that a forked version
of SeaBIOS available at https://github.com/hdeller/seabios-hppa is used
which requires some information about the emulated machine.

This patch adds code to generate a header file with the necessary
information for SeaBIOS. The information is extracted from the firmware
the current kernel is running on.

Tested on a B160L workstation.
