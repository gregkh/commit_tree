arm/arm64: KVM: Introduce EL2-specific executable mappings

Until now, all EL2 executable mappings were derived from their
EL1 VA. Since we want to decouple the vectors mapping from
the rest of the hypervisor, we need to be able to map some
text somewhere else.

The "idmap" region (for lack of a better name) is ideally suited
for this, as we have a huge range that hardly has anything in it.

Let's extend the IO allocator to also deal with executable mappings,
thus providing the required feature.
