dt-bindings: clock: Add new bindings for TI Davinci PLL clocks

This adds a new binding for the PLL IP blocks in the mach-davinci
family of processors. Currently, only da850 has device tree support
but these bindings can also work for other SoCs in this family just
by adding new compatible strings.

Note: Although these PLL controllers are very similar to the TI Keystone
SoCs, we are not re-using those bindings. The Keystone bindings use a
legacy one-node-per-clock binding. Furthermore, the mach-davinici SoCs
have a slightly different PLL register layout and a number of quirks
that can't be handled by the existing bindings, so the keystone bindings
could not be used as-is anyway.
