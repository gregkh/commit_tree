Revert "staging: Disable lustre file system for MIPS, SH, and XTENSA"

This reverts commit 16f1eeb660bd2bfd223704ee6350706b39c55a7a.

The reason for this patch was that lustre used copy_from_user_page.
Commit 76133e66b141 ("staging/lustre: Replace jobid acquiring with per
node setting") removed that usage.
So the arch restrictions can go.
