net/mlx5e: PFC stall prevention support

Implement set/get functions to configure PFC stall prevention
timeout by tunables api through ethtool.
By default the stall prevention timeout is configured to 8 sec.
Timeout range is: 80-8000 msec.

Enabling stall prevention with the auto timeout will set
the timeout to 100 msec.
