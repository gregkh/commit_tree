pinctrl: devicetree: Fix dt_to_map_one_config handling of hogs

When dt_to_map_one_config() is called with a pinctrl_dev passed
in, it should only be using this if the node being looked up
is a hog. The code was always using the passed pinctrl_dev
without checking whether the dt node referred to it.

A pin controller can have pinctrl-n dependencies on other pin
controllers in these cases:

- the pin controller hardware is external, for example I2C, so
  needs other pin controller(s) to be setup to communicate with
  the hardware device.

- it is a child of a composite MFD so its of_node is shared with
  the parent MFD and other children of that MFD. Any part of that
  MFD could have dependencies on other pin controllers.

Because of this, dt_to_map_one_config() can't assume that if it
has a pinctrl_dev passed in then the node it looks up must be
a hog. It could be a reference to some other pin controller.
