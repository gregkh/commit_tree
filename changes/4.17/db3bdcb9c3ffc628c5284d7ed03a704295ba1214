mac80211: allow AP_VLAN operation on crypto controlled devices

In the current implementation, mac80211 advertises the support of
AP_VLANs based on the driver's support for AP mode; it also
blocks encrypted AP_VLAN operation on devices advertising
SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL.

The implementation seems weird in it's current form and could be
often confusing, this is because there can be drivers advertising
both SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL and AP mode support (ex: ath10k) in which case
AP_VLAN will still be supported but only in open BSS and not in
secured BSS.

When SW_CRYPTO_CONTROL is enabled, it makes more sense if the decision
to support AP_VLANs is left to the driver. Mac80211 can then allow
AP_VLAN operations depending on the driver support.
