Input: elan_i2c_smbus - fix corrupted stack

New ICs (like the one on the Lenovo T480s) answer to
ETP_SMBUS_IAP_VERSION_CMD 4 bytes instead of 3. This corrupts the stack
as i2c_smbus_read_block_data() uses the values returned by the i2c
device to know how many data it need to return.

i2c_smbus_read_block_data() can read up to 32 bytes (I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX)
and there is no safeguard on how many bytes are provided in the return
value. Ensure we always have enough space for any future firmware.
Also 0-initialize the values to prevent any access to uninitialized memory.
