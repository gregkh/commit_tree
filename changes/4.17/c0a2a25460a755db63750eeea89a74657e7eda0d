staging: ks7010: remove some dead code from ks_wlan_set_essid function

This commit removes death code which is not being used at all. The
statements which are contained inside the else block of preprocessor
#if 1 directive are no sense. Also remove #if 1 preprocessor stuff
just because it is just true and being executed always.
This change improves a bit readability of ks_wlan_set_essid function.
