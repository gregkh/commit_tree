nfsd: Add I/O trace points in the NFSv4 write path

NFSv4 write compound processing invokes nfsd_vfs_write directly. The
trace points currently in nfsd_write are not effective for NFSv4
writes.

Move the trace points into the shared nfsd_vfs_write() helper.

After the I/O, we also want to record any local I/O error that
might have occurred, and the total count of bytes that were actually
moved (rather than the requested number).
