Btrfs: delete dead code in btrfs_orphan_add()

btrfs_orphan_add() has had this case commented out since it was first
introduced in commit d68fc57b7e32 ("Btrfs: Metadata reservation for
orphan inodes"). Most of the orphan cleanup code has been rewritten
since then, so it's safe to say that this code isn't needed.
