xen: xen-pciback: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in pcistub_init_device

pcistub_init_device() is never called in atomic context.

The call chain ending up at pcistub_init_device() is:
[1] pcistub_init_device() <- pcistub_seize() <- pcistub_probe()
[2] pcistub_init_device() <- pcistub_init_devices_late() <-
	xen_pcibk_init()
pcistub_probe() is only set as ".probe" in struct pci_driver.
xen_pcibk_init() is is only set as a parameter of module_init().
These functions are not called in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
pcistub_init_device() calls kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
which can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
And I also manually check it.
