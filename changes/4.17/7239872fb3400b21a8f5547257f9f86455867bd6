i2c: qup: fixed releasing dma without flush operation completion

The QUP BSLP BAM generates the following error sometimes if the
current I2C DMA transfer fails and the flush operation has been
scheduled

    “bam-dma-engine 7884000.dma: Cannot free busy channel”

If any I2C error comes during BAM DMA transfer, then the QUP I2C
interrupt will be generated and the flush operation will be
carried out to make I2C consume all scheduled DMA transfer.
Currently, the same completion structure is being used for BAM
transfer which has already completed without reinit. It will make
flush operation wait_for_completion_timeout completed immediately
and will proceed for freeing the DMA resources where the
descriptors are still in process.
