sock: remove zerocopy sockopt restriction on closed tcp state

Socket option SO_ZEROCOPY determines whether the kernel ignores or
processes flag MSG_ZEROCOPY on subsequent send calls. This to avoid
changing behavior for legacy processes.

Limiting the state change to closed sockets is annoying with passive
sockets and not necessary for correctness. Once created, zerocopy skbs
are processed based on their private state, not this socket flag.

Remove the constraint.
