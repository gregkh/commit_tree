mm,vmscan: don't pretend forward progress upon shrinker_rwsem contention

Since we no longer use return value of shrink_slab() for normal reclaim,
the comment is no longer true.  If some do_shrink_slab() call takes
unexpectedly long (root cause of stall is currently unknown) when
register_shrinker()/unregister_shrinker() is pending, trying to drop
caches via /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches could become infinite cond_resched()
loop if many mem_cgroup are defined.  For safety, let's not pretend
forward progress.
