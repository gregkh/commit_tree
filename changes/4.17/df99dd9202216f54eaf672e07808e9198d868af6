drm/pl111: Use max memory bandwidth for resolution

We were previously selecting 1024x768 and 32BPP as the default
set-up for the PL111 consumers.

This does not work on elder systems: the device tree bindings
support a property "max-memory-bandwidth" in bytes/second that
states that if you exceed this the memory bus will saturate.
The result is flickering and unstable images.

Parse the "max-memory-bandwidth" and respect it when
intializing the driver. On the RealView PB11MP, Versatile and
Integrator/CP we get a nice console as default with this code.
