inet: frags: get rid of nf_ct_frag6_skb_cb/NFCT_FRAG6_CB

nf_ct_frag6_queue() uses skb->cb[] to store the fragment offset,
meaning that we could use two cache lines per skb when finding
the insertion point, if for some reason inet6_skb_parm size
is increased in the future.

By using skb->ip_defrag_offset instead of skb->cb[] we pack all the fields
in a single cache line, matching what we did for IPv4.
