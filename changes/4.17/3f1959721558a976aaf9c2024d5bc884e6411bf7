kasan: fix memory hotplug during boot

Using module_init() is wrong.  E.g.  ACPI adds and onlines memory before
our memory notifier gets registered.

This makes sure that ACPI memory detected during boot up will not result
in a kernel crash.

Easily reproducible with QEMU, just specify a DIMM when starting up.
