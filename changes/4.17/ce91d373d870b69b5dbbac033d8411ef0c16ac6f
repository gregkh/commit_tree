drm/rockchip: vop: Init vskiplines in scl_vop_cal_scale()

Currently we are calling scl_vop_cal_scale() to get vskiplines for yrgb
and cbcr. So the cbcr's vskiplines might be an unexpected value if the
second scl_vop_cal_scale() didn't update it.

Init vskiplines in scl_vop_cal_scale() to avoid that.
