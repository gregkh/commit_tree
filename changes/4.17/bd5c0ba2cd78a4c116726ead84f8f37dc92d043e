tools/memory-model: Finish the removal of rb-dep, smp_read_barrier_depends(), and lockless_dereference()

Commit:

  bf28ae562744 ("tools/memory-model: Remove rb-dep, smp_read_barrier_depends, and lockless_dereference")

was merged too early, while it was still in RFC form.  This patch adds in
the missing pieces.

Akira pointed out some typos in the original patch, and he noted that
cheatsheet.txt should indicate that READ_ONCE() now implies an address
dependency.  Andrea suggested documenting the relationship betwwen
unsuccessful RMW operations and address dependencies.

Andrea pointed out that the macro for rcu_dereference() in linux.def
should now use the "once" annotation instead of "deref".  He also
suggested that the comments should mention commit:

  5a8897cc7631 ("locking/atomics/alpha: Add smp_read_barrier_depends() to _release()/_relaxed() atomics")

... as an important precursor, and he contributed commit:

  cb13b424e986 ("locking/xchg/alpha: Add unconditional memory barrier to cmpxchg()")

which is another prerequisite.
