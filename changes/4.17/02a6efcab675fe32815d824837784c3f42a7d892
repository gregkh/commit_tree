net: phy: allow scanning busses with missing phys

Some MDIO busses will error out when trying to read a phy address with no
phy present at that address. In that case, probing the bus will fail
because __mdiobus_register() is scanning the bus for all possible phys
addresses.

In case MII_PHYSID1 returns -EIO or -ENODEV, consider there is no phy at
this address and set the phy ID to 0xffffffff which is then properly
handled in get_phy_device().
