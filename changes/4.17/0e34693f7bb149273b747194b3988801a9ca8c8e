btrfs: Make btrfs_trans_release_metadata private to transaction.c

This function is only ever used in __btrfs_end_transaction and
btrfs_commit_transaction so there is no need to export it via header.
Let's move it closer to where it's used, make it static and remove it
from the header. No functional changes.
