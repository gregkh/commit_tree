drm/dp: Add definitions for TPS4 bits and macros to check the support

DP 1.4 spec adds a TPS4 training pattern sequence required for
HBR3. This patch adds the corresponding bit definitions in
MAX_DOWNSPREAD register and TRAINING_PATTERN_SET and
inline functions to check if this bit is set and for selecting
a proper TRAINING_PATTERN_MASK that changed to 0x7 on
DP spec 1.4
