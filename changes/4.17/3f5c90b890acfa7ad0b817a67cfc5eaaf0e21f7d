KVM: arm64: Introduce VHE-specific kvm_vcpu_run

So far this is mostly (see below) a copy of the legacy non-VHE switch
function, but we will start reworking these functions in separate
directions to work on VHE and non-VHE in the most optimal way in later
patches.

The only difference after this patch between the VHE and non-VHE run
functions is that we omit the branch-predictor variant-2 hardening for
QC Falkor CPUs, because this workaround is specific to a series of
non-VHE ARMv8.0 CPUs.
