drm/vmwgfx: Stricter count of legacy surface device resources

For legacy surfaces, they were previously registered as device resources
when the driver resources were created. Since they are evictable we instead
register them as device resources once they are created on the device,
just like for guest-backed surfaces. This has implications during
hibernation where we can't hibernate with device resources active.
