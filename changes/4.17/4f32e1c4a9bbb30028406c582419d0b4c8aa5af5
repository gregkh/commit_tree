net/mlx4_en: Remove unnecessary warn print in reset config

In mlx4_en_reset_config, there was a redundant warn print that was left
from previous versions of this function. No warn is needed anymore.

This warn can be confusing when RX-FCS is changed:
Turn OFF RX-FCS:
  mlx4_en: eth1: Changing device configuration rx filter(0) rx vlan(1)
Turn ON RX-FCS:
  mlx4_en: eth1: Changing device configuration rx filter(0) rx vlan(1)
