tipc: obsolete TIPC_ZONE_SCOPE

Publications for TIPC_CLUSTER_SCOPE and TIPC_ZONE_SCOPE are in all
aspects handled the same way, both on the publishing node and on the
receiving nodes.

Despite previous ambitions to the contrary, this is never going to change,
so we take the conseqeunce of this and obsolete TIPC_ZONE_SCOPE and related
macros/functions. Whenever a user is doing a bind() or a sendmsg() attempt
using ZONE_SCOPE we translate this internally to CLUSTER_SCOPE, while we
remain compatible with users and remote nodes still using ZONE_SCOPE.

Furthermore, the non-formalized scope value 0 has always been permitted
for use during lookup, with the same meaning as ZONE_SCOPE/CLUSTER_SCOPE.
We now permit it even as binding scope, but for compatibility reasons we
choose to not change the value of TIPC_CLUSTER_SCOPE.
