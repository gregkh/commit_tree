checkpatch: add test for assignment at start of line

Kernel style seems to prefer line wrapping an assignment with the
assignment operator on the previous line like:

	<leading tabs>	identifier =
				expression;
over
	<leading tabs>	identifier
				= expression;

somewhere around a 50:1 ratio

$ git grep -P "[^=]=\s*$" -- "*.[ch]" | wc -l
52008
$ git grep -P "^\s+[\*\/\+\|\%\-]?=[^=>]" | wc -l
1161

So add a --strict test for that condition.
