PCI: Remove redundant probes for device reset support

We probe every device for whether it supports reset so we can tell whether
to create a sysfs "reset" file for it.  We do that probe in
pci_init_capabilities() during enumeration and save the result in
dev->reset_fn.  The result doesn't depend on any other devices on the bus
and shouldn't change after boot, so we don't need to do the probe again.

Remove the pci_probe_reset_function() calls and rely on the dev->reset_fn
we found during enumeration.  No functional change intended.
