f2fs: remove redundant initialization of pointer 'p'

Pointer p is initialized with a value that is never read and is later
re-assigned a new value, hence the initialization is redundant and can
be removed.

Cleans up clang warning:
fs/f2fs/extent_cache.c:463:19: warning: Value stored to 'p' during
its initialization is never read
