net: sched: fix unbalance in the error path of tca_action_flush()

When tca_action_flush() calls the action walk() and gets an error,
a successful call to nla_nest_start() is not followed by a call to
nla_nest_cancel(). It's harmless, as the skb is freed in the error
path - but it's worth to fix this unbalance.
