audit: deprecate the AUDIT_FILTER_ENTRY filter

The audit entry filter has been long deprecated with userspace support
finally removed in audit-v2.6.7 and plans to remove kernel support have
existed since kernel-v2.6.31.
Remove it.

Since removing the audit entry filter, test for early return before
setting up any context state.

Passes audit-testsuite.
