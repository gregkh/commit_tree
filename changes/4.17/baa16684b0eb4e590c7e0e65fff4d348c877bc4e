kbuild: remove wrong 'touch' in adjust_autoksyms.sh

The comment mentions it creates autoksyms.h in case it is missing,
but the actual code touches it when it does exists.

The build system creates it anyway because <linux/export.h> and
<asm-generic/export.h> need it.

The code would not have worked as intended, and people have not
noticed it.  This is a proof that we can simply remove it.
