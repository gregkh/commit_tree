net: Allow a rule to track originating protocol

Allow a rule that is being added/deleted/modified or
dumped to contain the originating protocol's id.

The protocol is handled just like a routes originating
protocol is.  This is especially useful because there
is starting to be a plethora of different user space
programs adding rules.

Allow the vrf device to specify that the kernel is the originator
of the rule created for this device.
