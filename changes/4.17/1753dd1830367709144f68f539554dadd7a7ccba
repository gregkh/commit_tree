powerpc/mm/slice: Simplify and optimise slice context initialisation

The slice state of an mm gets zeroed then initialised upon exec.
This is the only caller of slice_set_user_psize now, so that can be
removed and instead implement a faster and simplified approach that
requires no locking or checking existing state.

This speeds up vfork+exec+exit performance on POWER8 by 3%.
