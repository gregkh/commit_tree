battery: Add the battery hooking API

This is a patch that implements a generic hooking API for the
generic ACPI battery driver.

With this new generic API, drivers can expose platform specific
behaviour via sysfs attributes in /sys/class/power_supply/BATn/
in a generic way.

A perfect example of the need for this API are Lenovo ThinkPads.

Lenovo ThinkPads have a ACPI extension that allows the setting of
start and stop charge thresholds in the EC and battery firmware
via ACPI. The thinkpad_acpi module can use this API to expose
sysfs attributes that it controls inside the ACPI battery driver
sysfs tree, under /sys/class/power_supply/BATN/.

The file drivers/acpi/battery.h has been moved to
include/acpi/battery.h and the includes inside ac.c, sbs.c, and
battery.c have been adjusted to reflect that.

When drivers hooks into the API, the API calls add_battery() for
each battery in the system that passes it a acpi_battery
struct. Then, the drivers can use device_create_file() to create
new sysfs attributes with that struct and identify the batteries
for per-battery attributes.
