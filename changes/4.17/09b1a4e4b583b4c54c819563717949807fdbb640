drm/i915/lrc: Clear context restore/save inhibit flags for new contexts

CTX_CONTEXT_CONTROL (CTX_SR_CTL) operates as a masked register and so
will only apply the bits that are selected by the upper half. In the
case of selectively enabling sr inhibit, this may mean the context keeps
the current setting (so forgetting to save the context later, eventually
leading to a very upset GPU!).

Fixes: 517aaffe0c1b ("drm/i915/execlists: Inhibit context save/restore for the fake preempt context")
