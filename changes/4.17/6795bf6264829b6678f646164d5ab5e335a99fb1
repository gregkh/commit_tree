media: ngene: convert kernellog printing from printk() to dev_*() macros

Convert all printk() and pr_*() kernel log printing to rather use the
dev_*() macros. Not only is it discouraged to use printk() (checkpatch
even complains about that), but also this helps identifying the exact PCI
device for any printed event, and it makes almost all printing shorter
in terms of code style since there's no need to use KERN_* DEVICE_NAME
any more (dev_*() will take care of this).

Since the dprintk macro define isn't used anymore, remove it.
