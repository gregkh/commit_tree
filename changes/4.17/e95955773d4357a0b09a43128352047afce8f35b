RDMA/hns: Fix cq record doorbell enable in kernel

Upon detecting both kernel and user space support record doorbell,
the kernel needs to enable this capability in hardware by db_en,
and it should take place before cq context configuration in
hns_roce_cq_alloc. Currently, db_en is configured after cq alloc
and db_map_user has similar problem.
