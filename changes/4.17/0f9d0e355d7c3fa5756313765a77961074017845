ASoC: da7219: clkdev_drop usage depends on CONFIG_COMMON_CLK

Fixes: ASoC: da7219: Add common clock usage for providing DAI clks

clkdev_drop usage in the codec remove function should be dependent
on if CONFIG_COMMON_CLK is defined for the platform, otherwise it
can cause build failures for platforms that do not support this.
The clkdev_* functions are still defined for those platforms, in
headers and source but the functions are not linked in.

This patch resolves this issue, so clkdev_drop is only used if
CONFIG_COMMON_CLK is defined.
