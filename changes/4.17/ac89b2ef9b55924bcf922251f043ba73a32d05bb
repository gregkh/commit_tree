9p: don't maintain dir i_nlink if the exported fs doesn't either

If the exported filesystem dir on 9p server doesn't maintain accurate
i_nlink count, e.g.  always reports i_nlink as 1, then 9p should not
maintain nlink count either, otherwise drop_link would report warning
with i_nlink being zero.

For example:

 - overlayfs sets nlink to 1 for merged dir

 - ext4 (with dir_nlink feature enabled) sets nlink to 1 if a dir has
   more than EXT4_LINK_MAX (65000) links.

In this case, everytime a stat(2) call (getattr) on such exported dirs
on 9p client side, the i_nlink gets reset to 1, then operations like
rmdir(2), unlink(2) and rename(2) would cause the dir nlink to go to
zero (then negative), which results in warnings in drop_nlink() and/or
inc_nlink() calls.

This can be reproduced easily as the following steps:

 - export a merged overlayfs dir via qemu virtfs to guest

 - mount the exported virtfs in guest

 - create two sub-directories in the root dir of the mounted 9pfs

 - stat the root dir of 9pfs, this resets nlink to 1

 - remove all subdirs, the second unlink/rmdir would trigger warning

Fix it by leaving i_nlink to be 1 and don't drop nlink if a directory
has nlink <= 2, which indicates that the underlying exported fs doesn't
maintain nlink count accurately.  This follows what ext4 does in
ext4_dec_count().
