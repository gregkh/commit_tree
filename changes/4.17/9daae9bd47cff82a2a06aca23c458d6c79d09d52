net: Call add/kill vid ndo on vlan filter feature toggling

NETIF_F_HW_VLAN_[CS]TAG_FILTER features require more than just a bit
flip in dev->features in order to keep the driver in a consistent state.
These features notify the driver of each added/removed vlan, but toggling
of vlan-filter does not notify the driver accordingly for each of the
existing vlans.

This patch implements a similar solution to NETIF_F_RX_UDP_TUNNEL_PORT
behavior (which notifies the driver about UDP ports in the same manner
that vids are reported).

Each toggling of the features propagates to the 8021q module, which
iterates over the vlans and call add/kill ndo accordingly.
