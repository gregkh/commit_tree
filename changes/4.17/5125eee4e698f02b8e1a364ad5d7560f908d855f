tracing: Fixup logic inversion on setting trace_global_clock defaults

In commit 932066a15335 ("tracing: Default to using trace_global_clock if
sched_clock is unstable"), the logic for deciding to override the
default clock if unstable was reversed from the earlier posting. I was
trying to reduce the width of the message by using an early return
rather than a if-block, but reverted back to using the if-block and
accidentally left the predicate inverted.
