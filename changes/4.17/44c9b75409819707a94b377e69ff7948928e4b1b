crypto: x86/camellia-aesni-avx2 - remove LRW algorithm

The LRW template now wraps an ECB mode algorithm rather than the block
cipher directly.  Therefore it is now redundant for crypto modules to
wrap their ECB code with generic LRW code themselves via lrw_crypt().

Remove the lrw-camellia-aesni-avx2 algorithm which did this.  Users who
request lrw(camellia) and previously would have gotten
lrw-camellia-aesni-avx2 will now get lrw(ecb-camellia-aesni-avx2)
instead, which is just as fast.
