gpio: Add GPIO driver for Nintendo Wii

The Nintendo Wii's chipset (called "Hollywood") has a GPIO controller
that supports a configurable number of pins (up to 32), interrupts, and
some special mechanisms to share the controller between the system's
security processor (an ARM926) and the PowerPC CPU. Pin multiplexing is
not supported.

This patch adds a basic driver for this GPIO controller. Interrupt
support will come in a later patch.

This patch is based on code developed by Albert Herranz and the GameCube
Linux Team, file arch/powerpc/platforms/embedded6xx/hlwd-gpio.c,
available at https://github.com/DeltaResero/GC-Wii-Linux-Kernels, but
has grown quite dissimilar.

v3:
- Do some style cleanups, as suggest by Andy Shevchenko

v2:
- Change hlwd_gpio_driver.driver.name to "gpio-hlwd" to match the
  filename (was "hlwd_gpio")
- Remove unnecessary include of linux/of_gpio.h, as suggested by Linus
  Walleij.
- Add struct device pointer to context struct to make it possible to use
  dev_info(hlwd->dev, "..."), as suggested by Linus Walleij
- Use the GPIO_GENERIC library to reduce code size, as suggested by
  Linus Walleij
- Use iowrite32be instead of __raw_writel for big-endian MMIO access, as
  suggested by Linus Walleij
- Remove commit message paragraph suggesting to diff against the
  original driver, because it's so different now
