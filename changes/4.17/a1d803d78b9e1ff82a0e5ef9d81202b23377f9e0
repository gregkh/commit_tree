clk: versatile: Remove WARNs in ->round_rate()

clk_round_rate() is intended to be used to round a given clock rate to
the closest one achievable by the actual clock. This implies that the
input to clk_round_rate() is expected to be unachievable - and such
cases shouldn't be treated as exceptional.

To reflect this, remove the WARN_ONs which trigger when an unachievable
clock rate is passed to vexpress_osc_round_rate().
