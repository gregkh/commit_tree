fanotify: fix logic of events on child

When event on child inodes are sent to the parent inode mark and
parent inode mark was not marked with FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD, the event
will not be delivered to the listener process. However, if the same
process also has a mount mark, the event to the parent inode will be
delivered regadless of the mount mark mask.

This behavior is incorrect in the case where the mount mark mask does
not contain the specific event type. For example, the process adds
a mark on a directory with mask FAN_MODIFY (without FAN_EVENT_ON_CHILD)
and a mount mark with mask FAN_CLOSE_NOWRITE (without FAN_ONDIR).

A modify event on a file inside that directory (and inside that mount)
should not create a FAN_MODIFY event, because neither of the marks
requested to get that event on the file.
