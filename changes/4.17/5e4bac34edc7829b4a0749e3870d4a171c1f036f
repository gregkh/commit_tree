leaking_addresses: cache architecture name

Currently we are repeatedly calling `uname -m`.  This is causing the
script to take a long time to run (more than 10 seconds to parse
/proc/kallsyms).  We can use Perl state variables to cache the result of
the first call to `uname -m`.  With this change in place the script
scans the whole kernel in under a minute.

Cache machine architecture in state variable.
