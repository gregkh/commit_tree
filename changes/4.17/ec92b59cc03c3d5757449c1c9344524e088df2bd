scsi: ufs: sysfs: attributes

This patch introduces a sysfs group entry for the UFS attributes. The
group adds "attributes" folder under the UFS driver sysfs entry
(/sys/bus/platform/drivers/ufshcd/*). The attributes are shown
as hexadecimal numbers. The full information about the attributes could
be found at UFS specifications 2.1.
