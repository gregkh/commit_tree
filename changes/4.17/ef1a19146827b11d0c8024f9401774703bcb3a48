drm/i915: Extract intel_plane_{pin,unpin}_fb()

We've replicated the fb pin/unpin code in a few places. Pull it into
convenint helpers.

Slight change in locking behaviour as intel_cleanup_plane_fb() now
grab struct_mutex unconditionally.

v2: Change the locking to be symmetric between pin and unpin
