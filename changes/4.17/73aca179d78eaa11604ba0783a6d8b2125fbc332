powerpc/modules: Fix crashes by adding CONFIG_RELOCATABLE to vermagic

If you build the kernel with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=n, then install the
modules, rebuild the kernel with CONFIG_RELOCATABLE=y and leave the
old modules installed, we crash something like:

  Unable to handle kernel paging request for data at address 0xd000000018d66cef
  Faulting instruction address: 0xc0000000021ddd08
  Oops: Kernel access of bad area, sig: 11 [#1]

    SyS_finit_module+0x110/0x140
    system_call+0x58/0x6c

This happens because since commit 71810db27c1c ("modversions: treat
symbol CRCs as 32 bit quantities"), a relocatable kernel encodes and
handles symbol CRCs differently from a non-relocatable kernel.

Although it's possible we could try and detect this situation and
handle it, it's much more robust to simply make the state of
CONFIG_RELOCATABLE part of the module vermagic.
