usb: dwc3: Prevent indefinite sleep in _dwc3_set_mode during suspend/resume

In the following test we get stuck by sleeping forever in _dwc3_set_mode()
after which dual-role switching doesn't work.

On dra7-evm's dual-role port,
- Load g_zero gadget driver and enumerate to host
- suspend to mem
- disconnect USB cable to host and connect otg cable with Pen drive in it.
- resume system
- we sleep indefinitely in _dwc3_set_mode due to.
  dwc3_gadget_exit()->usb_del_gadget_udc()->udc_stop()->
	dwc3_gadget_stop()->wait_event_lock_irq()

To fix this instead of waiting indefinitely with wait_event_lock_irq()
we use wait_event_interruptible_lock_irq_timeout() and print
and error message if there was a timeout.
