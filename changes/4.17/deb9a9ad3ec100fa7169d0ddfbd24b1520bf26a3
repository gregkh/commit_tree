i40evf: remove redundant array comparisons to 0 checks

The checks to see if key->dst.s6_addr and key->src.s6_addr are null
pointers are redundant because these are constant size arrays and
so the checks always return true.  Fix this by removing the redundant
checks.   Also replace filter->f with vf, allowing wide lines to be
condensed and to rejoin some split wide lines.
