tipc: fix missing initializer in tipc_sendmsg()

The stack variable 'dnode' in __tipc_sendmsg() may theoretically
end up tipc_node_get_mtu() as an unitilalized variable.

We fix this by intializing the variable at declaration. We also add
a default else clause to the two conditional ones already there, so
that we never end up in the named function if the given address
type is illegal.
