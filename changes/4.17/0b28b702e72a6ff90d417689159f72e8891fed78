ice: Support link events, reset and rebuild

Link events are posted to a PF's admin receive queue (ARQ). This patch
adds the ability to detect and process link events.

This patch also adds the ability to process resets.

The driver can process the following resets:
    1) EMP Reset (EMPR)
    2) Global Reset (GLOBR)
    3) Core Reset (CORER)
    4) Physical Function Reset (PFR)

EMPR is the largest level of reset that the driver can handle. An EMPR
resets the manageability block and also the data path, including PHY and
link for all the PFs. The affected PFs are notified of this event through
a miscellaneous interrupt.

GLOBR is a subset of EMPR. It does everything EMPR does except that it
doesn't reset the manageability block.

CORER is a subset of GLOBR. It does everything GLOBR does but doesn't
reset PHY and link.

PFR is a subset of CORER and affects only the given physical function.
In other words, PFR can be thought of as a CORER for a single PF. Since
only the issuing PF is affected, a PFR doesn't result in the miscellaneous
interrupt being triggered.

All the resets have the following in common:
1) Tx/Rx is halted and all queues are stopped.
2) All the VSIs and filters programmed for the PF are lost and have to be
   reprogrammed.
3) Control queue interfaces are reset and have to be reprogrammed.

In the rebuild flow, control queues are reinitialized, VSIs are reallocated
and filters are restored.
