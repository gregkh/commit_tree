kdb: use memmove instead of overlapping memcpy

gcc discovered that the memcpy() arguments in kdbnearsym() overlap, so
we should really use memmove(), which is defined to handle that correctly:

In function 'memcpy',
    inlined from 'kdbnearsym' at /git/arm-soc/kernel/debug/kdb/kdb_support.c:132:4:
/git/arm-soc/include/linux/string.h:353:9: error: '__builtin_memcpy' accessing 792 bytes at offsets 0 and 8 overlaps 784 bytes at offset 8 [-Werror=restrict]
  return __builtin_memcpy(p, q, size);
