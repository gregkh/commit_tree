media: v4l2-dev.h: fix symbol collision in media_entity_to_video_device()

A recent change to the media_entity_to_video_device() macro breaks some
use-cases for the macro due to a symbol collision. Before the change
this worked:

    vdev = media_entity_to_video_device(link->sink->entity);

While after the change it results in a compiler error "error: 'struct
video_device' has no member named 'link'; did you mean 'lock'?". While
the following still works after the change.

    struct media_entity *entity = link->sink->entity;
    vdev = media_entity_to_video_device(entity);

Fix the collision by renaming the macro argument to '__entity'.
