powerpc/pseries: Restore default security feature flags on setup

After migration the security feature flags might have changed (e.g.,
destination system with unpatched firmware), but some flags are not
set/clear again in init_cpu_char_feature_flags() because it assumes
the security flags to be the defaults.

Additionally, if the H_GET_CPU_CHARACTERISTICS hypercall fails then
init_cpu_char_feature_flags() does not run again, which potentially
might leave the system in an insecure or sub-optimal configuration.

So, just restore the security feature flags to the defaults assumed
by init_cpu_char_feature_flags() so it can set/clear them correctly,
and to ensure safe settings are in place in case the hypercall fail.
