watchdog: renesas-wdt: Add support for WDIOF_CARDRESET

This patch adds the WDIOF_CARDRESET support for the Renesas platform
watchdog, to know if the board reboot is due to a watchdog reset.

This is done via the WOVF bit (bit 4) of the RWTCSRA register, which
indicates if RWTCNT overflowed, triggering the reset in last boot.
