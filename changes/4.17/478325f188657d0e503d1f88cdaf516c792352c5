tracing: Clean up and document pred_funcs_##type creation and use

The pred_funcs_##type arrays consist of five functions that are assigned
based on the ops. The array must be in the same order of the ops each
function represents. The PRED_FUNC_START macro denotes the op enum that
starts the op that maps to the pred_funcs_##type arrays. This is all very
subtle and prone to bugs if the code is changed.

Add comments describing how PRED_FUNC_START and pred_funcs_##type array is
used, and also a PRED_FUNC_MAX that is the maximum number of functions in
the arrays.

Clean up select_comparison_fn() that assigns the predicates to the
pred_funcs_##type array function as well as add protection in case an op is
passed in that does not map correctly to the array.
