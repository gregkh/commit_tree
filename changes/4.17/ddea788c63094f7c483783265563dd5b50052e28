bonding: do not set slave_dev npinfo before slave_enable_netpoll in bond_enslave

After Commit 8a8efa22f51b ("bonding: sync netpoll code with bridge"), it
would set slave_dev npinfo in slave_enable_netpoll when enslaving a dev
if bond->dev->npinfo was set.

However now slave_dev npinfo is set with bond->dev->npinfo before calling
slave_enable_netpoll. With slave_dev npinfo set, __netpoll_setup called
in slave_enable_netpoll will not call slave dev's .ndo_netpoll_setup().
It causes that the lower dev of this slave dev can't set its npinfo.

One way to reproduce it:

  # modprobe bonding
  # brctl addbr br0
  # brctl addif br0 eth1
  # ifconfig bond0 192.168.122.1/24 up
  # ifenslave bond0 eth2
  # systemctl restart netconsole
  # ifenslave bond0 br0
  # ifconfig eth2 down
  # systemctl restart netconsole

The netpoll won't really work.

This patch is to remove that slave_dev npinfo setting in bond_enslave().
