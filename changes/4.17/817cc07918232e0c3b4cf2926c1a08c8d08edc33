drm/i915: Handle RC6 counter wrap

We can implement limited RC6 counter wrap-around protection under the
assumption that clients will be reading this value more frequently than
the wrap period on a given platform.

With the typical wrap-around period being ~90 minutes, even with the
exception of Baytrail which wraps every 13 seconds, this sounds like a
reasonable assumption.

Implementation works by storing a 64-bit software copy of a hardware RC6
counter, along with the previous HW counter snapshot. This enables it to
detect wrap is polled frequently enough and keep the software copy
monotonically incrementing.

v2:
 * Missed GEN6_GT_GFX_RC6_LOCKED when considering slot sizing and
   indexing.
 * Fixed off-by-one in wrap-around handling. (Chris Wilson)

v3:
 * Simplify index checking by using unsigned int. (Chris Wilson)
 * Expand the comment to explain why indexing works.

v4:
 * Use __int128 if supported.

v5:
 * Use mul_u64_u32_div. (Chris Wilson)
