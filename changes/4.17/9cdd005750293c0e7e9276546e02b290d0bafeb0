ath10k: fix TDLS peer TX data failure issue on encryped AP

For WPA encryption, QCA6174 firmware(version: WLAN.RM.4.4) will unblock
data when M4 was sent successfully. For other encryption which didn't need
4-way handshake firmware will unblock the data when peer authorized. Since
TDLS is 3-way handshake host need send authorize cmd to firmware to unblock
data.
