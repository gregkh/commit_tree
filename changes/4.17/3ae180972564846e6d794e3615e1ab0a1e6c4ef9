ALSA: timer: Fix pause event notification

Commit f65e0d299807 ("ALSA: timer: Call notifier in the same spinlock")
combined the start/continue and stop/pause functions, and in doing so
changed the event code for the pause case to SNDRV_TIMER_EVENT_CONTINUE.
Change it back to SNDRV_TIMER_EVENT_PAUSE.
