MAINTAINERS: add personal addresses for Sascha and Uwe

The idea behind using kernel@pengutronix.de (i.e. the mail alias for the
kernel people at Pengutronix) as email address was to have a backup when
a given developer is on vacation or run over by a bus. Make this more
explicit by adding the alias as reviewer and use the personal address
for Sascha and me.
