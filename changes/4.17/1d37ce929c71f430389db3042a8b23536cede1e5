ASoC: da7219: make structure da7219_dai_clks_ops static

structure da7219_dai_clks_ops is local to the source and does not need
to be in global scope, so make it static.

Cleans up sparse warning:
sound/soc/codecs/da7219.c:1777:22: warning: symbol 'da7219_dai_clks_ops'
was not declared. Should it be static?
