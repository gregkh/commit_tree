xhci: Clear the host side toggle manually when endpoint is soft reset

Some devices use a clear endpoint halt request as a soft reset, even if
the endpoint is not halted. This will clear the toggle and sequence on the
device side.

xHCI however refuses to reset a non-halted endpoint, so instead
we need to issue a configure endpoint command on xHCI to clear its host
side toggle and sequence, and get it in sync with the device side.

This is a respin of a old patch that was reverted as it had a stale
endpoint context dequeue value which caused regression.
