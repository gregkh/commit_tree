ice: Get switch config, scheduler config and device capabilities

This patch adds to the initialization flow by getting switch
configuration, scheduler configuration and device capabilities.

Switch configuration:
On boot, an L2 switch element is created in the firmware per physical
function. Each physical function is also mapped to a port, to which its
switch element is connected. In other words, this switch can be visualized
as an embedded vSwitch that can connect a physical function's virtual
station interfaces (VSIs) to the egress/ingress port. Egress/ingress
filters will be eventually created and applied on this switch element.
As part of the initialization flow, the driver gets configuration data
from this switch element and stores it.

Scheduler configuration:
The Tx scheduler is a subsystem responsible for setting and enforcing QoS.
As part of the initialization flow, the driver queries and stores the
default scheduler configuration for the given physical function.

Device capabilities:
As part of initialization, the driver has to determine what the device is
capable of (ex. max queues, VSIs, etc). This information is obtained from
the firmware and stored by the driver.
