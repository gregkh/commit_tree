dax, dm: allow device-mapper to operate without dax support

Change device-mapper's DAX dependency to require the presence of at
least one DAX_DRIVER. This allows device-mapper to be built without
bringing the DAX core along which is especially wasteful when there are
no DAX drivers, like BLK_DEV_PMEM, configured.
