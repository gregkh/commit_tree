tracing: Add support for 'field variables'

Users should be able to directly specify event fields in hist trigger
'actions' rather than being forced to explicitly create a variable for
that purpose.

Add support allowing fields to be used directly in actions, which
essentially does just that - creates 'invisible' variables for each
bare field specified in an action.  If a bare field refers to a field
on another (matching) event, it even creates a special histogram for
the purpose (since variables can't be defined on an existing histogram
after histogram creation).

Here's a simple example that demonstrates both.  Basically the
onmatch() action creates a list of variables corresponding to the
parameters of the synthetic event to be generated, and then uses those
values to generate the event.  So for the wakeup_latency synthetic
event 'call' below the first param, $wakeup_lat, is a variable defined
explicitly on sched_switch, where 'next_pid' is just a normal field on
sched_switch, and prio is a normal field on sched_waking.

Since the mechanism works on variables, those two normal fields just
have 'invisible' variables created internally for them.  In the case of
'prio', which is on another event, we actually need to create an
additional hist trigger and define the invisible variable on that, since
once a hist trigger is defined, variables can't be added to it later.

  echo 'wakeup_latency u64 lat; pid_t pid; int prio' >>
       /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/synthetic_events

  echo 'hist:keys=pid:ts0=common_timestamp.usecs >>
       /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_waking/trigger

echo 'hist:keys=next_pid:wakeup_lat=common_timestamp.usecs-$ts0:
      onmatch(sched.sched_waking).wakeup_latency($wakeup_lat,next_pid,prio)
            >> /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/events/sched/sched_switch/trigger
