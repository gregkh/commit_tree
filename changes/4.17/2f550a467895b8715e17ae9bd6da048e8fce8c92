net: hns3: export pci table of hclge and hclgevf to userspace

There is no module that is dependent on hclge or hclgevf's symbol,
but hns_enet need them to provide ops for it to run. When there is
a need to auto load the hns3 driver, the auto load will fail because
hclge or hclgevf is not loaded.

Hns_enet has already exported the pci table, so this patch exports
the pci table for hclge and hclgevf module too.
