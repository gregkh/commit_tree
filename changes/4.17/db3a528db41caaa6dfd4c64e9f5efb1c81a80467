powerpc/mm/slice: Enhance for supporting PPC32

In preparation for the following patch which will fix an issue on
the 8xx by re-using the 'slices', this patch enhances the
'slices' implementation to support 32 bits CPUs.

On PPC32, the address space is limited to 4Gbytes, hence only the low
slices will be used.

The high slices use bitmaps. As bitmap functions are not prepared to
handle bitmaps of size 0, this patch ensures that bitmap functions
are called only when SLICE_NUM_HIGH is not nul.
