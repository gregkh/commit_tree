batman-adv: prevent TT request storms by not sending inconsistent TT TLVLs

A translation table TVLV changset sent with an OGM consists
of a number of headers (one per VLAN) plus the changeset
itself (addition and/or deletion of entries).

The per-VLAN headers are used by OGM recipients for consistency
checks. Said consistency check might determine that a full
translation table request is needed to restore consistency. If
the TT sender adds per-VLAN headers of empty VLANs into the OGM,
recipients are led to believe to have reached an inconsistent
state and thus request a full table update. The full table does
not contain empty VLANs (due to missing entries) the cycle
restarts when the next OGM is issued.

Consequently, when the translation table TVLV headers are
composed, empty VLANs are to be excluded.
