i40evf: add ndo_setup_tc callback to i40evf

This patch introduces the callback to the ndo_setup_tc function
in the VF driver. We add a wrapper function to make room for the
upcoming cloud filter patches which add calls to different functions
from setup_tc.

First, we add support for capability exchange for ADQ between the
PF and VF. Next, we add support to take in the mqprio configuration
and configure queues as per the traffic classes, rate limit and the
priorities specified by the user. This is done by passing the channel
config to the PF driver through a virtchannel message.

The flags and bits added, track if ADq is enabled, set max number of
traffic classes to 4 and provide ability to negotiate capability with
the PF.
