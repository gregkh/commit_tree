powerpc/64s: Do not allocate lppaca if we are not virtualized

The "lppaca" is a structure registered with the hypervisor. This is
unnecessary when running on non-virtualised platforms. One field from
the lppaca (pmcregs_in_use) is also used by the host, so move the host
part out into the paca (lppaca field is still updated in
guest mode).
