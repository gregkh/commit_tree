vfio/pci: Add ioeventfd support

The ioeventfd here is actually irqfd handling of an ioeventfd such as
supported in KVM.  A user is able to pre-program a device write to
occur when the eventfd triggers.  This is yet another instance of
eventfd-irqfd triggering between KVM and vfio.  The impetus for this
is high frequency writes to pages which are virtualized in QEMU.
Enabling this near-direct write path for selected registers within
the virtualized page can improve performance and reduce overhead.
Specifically this is initially targeted at NVIDIA graphics cards where
the driver issues a write to an MMIO register within a virtualized
region in order to allow the MSI interrupt to re-trigger.
