KVM: Extend MAX_IRQ_ROUTES to 4096 for all archs

Our virtual machines make use of device assignment by configuring
12 NVMe disks for high I/O performance. Each NVMe device has 129
MSI-X Table entries:
Capabilities: [50] MSI-X: Enable+ Count=129 Masked-Vector table: BAR=0 offset=00002000
The windows virtual machines fail to boot since they will map the number of
MSI-table entries that the NVMe hardware reported to the bus to msi routing
table, this will exceed the 1024. This patch extends MAX_IRQ_ROUTES to 4096
for all archs, in the future this might be extended again if needed.
