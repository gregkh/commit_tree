media: rc: no need to announce major number

Since commit a60d64b15c20 ("media: lirc: lirc interface should not be
a raw decoder"), the message in the documentation is incorrect as the
module name is rc_core, not lirc_dev. Since the message is not useful,
just make the message debug and remove it from the documentation.
