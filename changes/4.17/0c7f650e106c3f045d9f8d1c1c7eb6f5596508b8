KVM: nVMX: Enforce NMI controls on vmentry of L2 guests

According to Intel SDM 26.2.1.1, the following rules should be enforced
on vmentry:

 *  If the "NMI exiting" VM-execution control is 0, "Virtual NMIs"
    VM-execution control must be 0.
 *  If the “virtual NMIs” VM-execution control is 0, the “NMI-window
    exiting” VM-execution control must be 0.

This patch enforces these rules when entering an L2 guest.
