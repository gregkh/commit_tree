USB: serial: visor: handle potential invalid device configuration

If we get an invalid device configuration from a palm 3 type device, we
might incorrectly parse things, and we have the potential to crash in
"interesting" ways.

Fix this up by verifying the size of the configuration passed to us by
the device, and only if it is correct, will we handle it.

Note that this also fixes an information leak of slab data.
