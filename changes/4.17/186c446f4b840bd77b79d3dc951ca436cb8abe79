media: arch: sh: migor: Use new renesas-ceu camera driver

Migo-R platform uses sh_mobile_ceu camera driver, which is now being
replaced by a proper V4L2 camera driver named 'renesas-ceu'.

Move Migo-R platform to use the v4l2 renesas-ceu camera driver
interface and get rid of soc_camera defined components used to register
sensor drivers and of platform specific enable/disable routines.

Register clock source and GPIOs for sensor drivers, so they can use
clock and gpio APIs.

Also, memory for CEU video buffers is now reserved with membocks APIs,
and need to be declared as dma_coherent during machine initialization to
remove that architecture specific part from CEU driver.
