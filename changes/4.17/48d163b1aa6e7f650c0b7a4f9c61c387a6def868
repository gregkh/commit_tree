dmaengine: qcom: bam_dma: get num-channels and num-ees from dt

When Linux is master of BAM, it can directly read registers to know number
of supported channels, however when its remotely controlled reading these
registers would trigger a crash if the BAM is not yet initialized or
powered up on the remote side.

This patch allows driver to read num-channels and num-ees from Device Tree
for remotely controlled BAM.
