tipc: tipc: rename address types in user api

The three address type structs in the user API have names that in
reality reflect the specific, non-Linux environment where they were
originally created.

We now give them more intuitive names, in accordance with how TIPC is
described in the current documentation.

struct tipc_portid   -> struct tipc_socket_addr
struct tipc_name     -> struct tipc_service_addr
struct tipc_name_seq -> struct tipc_service_range

To avoid confusion, we also update some commmets and macro names to
 match the new terminology.

For compatibility, we add macros that map all old names to the new ones.
