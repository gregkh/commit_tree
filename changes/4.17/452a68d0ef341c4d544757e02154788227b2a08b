KVM: hyperv: idr_find needs RCU protection

Even though the eventfd is released after the KVM SRCU grace period
elapses, the conn_to_evt data structure itself is not; it uses RCU
internally, instead.  Fix the read-side critical section to happen
under rcu_read_lock/unlock; the result is still protected by
vcpu->kvm->srcu.
