tracing: Remove code which merges duplicates

We now have the logic to detect and remove duplicates in the
tracing_map hash table. The code which merges duplicates in the
histogram is redundant now. So, modify this code just to detect
duplicates. The duplication detection code is still kept to ensure
that any rare race condition which might cause duplicates does not go
unnoticed.
