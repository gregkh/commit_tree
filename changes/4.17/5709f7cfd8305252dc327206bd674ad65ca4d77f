powerpc/mm/slice: implement a slice mask cache

Calculating the slice mask can become a signifcant overhead for
get_unmapped_area. This patch adds a struct slice_mask for
each page size in the mm_context, and keeps these in synch with
the slices psize arrays and slb_addr_limit.

On Book3S/64 this adds 288 bytes to the mm_context_t for the
slice mask caches.

On POWER8, this increases vfork+exec+exit performance by 9.9%
and reduces time to mmap+munmap a 64kB page by 28%.

Reduces time to mmap+munmap by about 10% on 8xx.
