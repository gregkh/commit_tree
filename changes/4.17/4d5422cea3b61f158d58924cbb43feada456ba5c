KVM: X86: Provide a capability to disable MWAIT intercepts

Allowing a guest to execute MWAIT without interception enables a guest
to put a (physical) CPU into a power saving state, where it takes
longer to return from than what may be desired by the host.

Don't give a guest that power over a host by default. (Especially,
since nothing prevents a guest from using MWAIT even when it is not
advertised via CPUID.)
