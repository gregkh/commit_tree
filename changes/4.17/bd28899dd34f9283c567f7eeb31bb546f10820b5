Revert "macsec: missing dev_put() on error in macsec_newlink()"

This patch is just wrong, sorry.  I was trying to fix a static checker
warning and misread the code.  The reference taken in macsec_newlink()
is released in macsec_free_netdev() when the netdevice is destroyed.

This reverts commit 5dcd8400884cc4a043a6d4617e042489e5d566a9.
