mmc: renesas_sdhi: use MMC_CAP2_NO_WRITE_PROTECT instead of TMIO own flag

TMIO_MMC_WRPROTECT_DISABLE is equivalent to MMC_CAP2_NO_WRITE_PROTECT.

The flag is propagated as follows:
       renesas_sdhi_of_data::capabilities2
    -> tmio_mmc_data::capabilities2
    -> mmc_host::caps2

Only the difference is the TMIO_... makes tmio_mmc_get_ro() return 0
(i.e. it does not affect mmc_gpio_get_ro() at all), while MMC_CAP2_...
returns 0 before calling ->get_ro() hook (i.e. it affects both IP own
logic and GPIO detection).

The TMIO MMC drivers do not set-up gpio_ro by themselves.  Only the
possibility, if any, would be DT specifies "wp-gpios" property, and
gpio_ro is set by mmc_gpiod_request_ro() called from mmc_of_parse().
However, it does not make sense to specify "wp-gpios" property and
TMIO_MMC_WRPROTECT_DISABLE at the same time.

I checked under arch/arm/boot/dts/ and arch/arm64/boot/dts/renesas/,
and I did not see any Renesas boards with "wp-gpios".  So, this
conversion should be safe.
