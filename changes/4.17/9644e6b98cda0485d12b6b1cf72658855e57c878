Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Remove duplication in gpio-mappings declaration

We declare the same set of const acpi_gpio_params twice with different
names, besides the needless duplication this naming leads to a sortof
double indirection which also makes it harder to see how the mapping is
actually setup.

This commit renames the first set to have generic names, which better
describe the contents of the mapping and drops the second set.
