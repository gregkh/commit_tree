sctp: fix the issue that flags are ignored when using kernel_connect

Now sctp uses inet_dgram_connect as its proto_ops .connect, and the flags
param can't be passed into its proto .connect where this flags is really
needed.

sctp works around it by getting flags from socket file in __sctp_connect.
It works for connecting from userspace, as inherently the user sock has
socket file and it passes f_flags as the flags param into the proto_ops
.connect.

However, the sock created by sock_create_kern doesn't have a socket file,
and it passes the flags (like O_NONBLOCK) by using the flags param in
kernel_connect, which calls proto_ops .connect later.

So to fix it, this patch defines a new proto_ops .connect for sctp,
sctp_inet_connect, which calls __sctp_connect() directly with this
flags param. After this, the sctp's proto .connect can be removed.

Note that sctp_inet_connect doesn't need to do some checks that are not
needed for sctp, which makes thing better than with inet_dgram_connect.
