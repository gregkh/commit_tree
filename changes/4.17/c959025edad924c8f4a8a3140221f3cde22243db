xfs: Remove "committed" argument of xfs_dir_ialloc

xfs_dir_ialloc() rolls the current transaction when allocation of a new
inode required the space manager to perform an allocation and replinish
the Inode btree.

None of the callers of xfs_dir_ialloc() need to know if the
transaction was committed. Hence this commit removes the "committed"
argument of xfs_dir_ialloc.
