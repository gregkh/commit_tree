remoteproc: Add remote processor coredump support

As the remoteproc framework restarts the remote processor after a fatal
event, it's useful to be able to acquire a coredump of the remote
processor's state, for post mortem debugging.

This patch introduces a mechanism for extracting the memory contents
after the remote has stopped and before the restart sequence has begun
in the recovery path. The remoteproc framework builds the core dump in
memory and use devcoredump to expose this to user space.
