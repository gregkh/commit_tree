drm/i915: Repeat the GEM_BUG_ON message in the ftrace log

As the ftrace log is overflowing the pstore capture, we lose the last
gasps from dmesg which includes the GEM_BUG_ON function:line and condition
that failed. Vital information for tracking down the bug, so append it to
the frace log as well.
