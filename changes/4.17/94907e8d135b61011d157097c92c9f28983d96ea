rtlwifi: btcoex: Add 8822be btcoex supported files for wifi only

The wifi only btcoex is used to solo card (without BT), and it is also
useful to exclude the interference with BT to make debug easier.
There are only four ops for wifi only btcoex to initialze antenna and
switch the settings while band is changed.
