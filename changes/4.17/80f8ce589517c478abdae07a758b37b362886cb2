clk: hi3798cv200: add COMBPHY0 clock support

The clock COMBPHY1 has already been supported by hi3798cv200 driver,
but COMBPHY0 is missing.  It adds COMBPHY0 clock support.

Since the mux table is being shared by COMBPHY0 and COMBPHY1, it renames
comphy1_mux_p and comphy1_mux_table a bit to drop instance number '1'
from there.
