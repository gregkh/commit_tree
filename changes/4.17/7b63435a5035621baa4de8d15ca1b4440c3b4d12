i40e: i40e: Change ethtool check from MAC to HW flag

The MAC, FW Version and NPAR check used to determine
if shutting off the FW LLDP engine is supported is not
using the usual feature check mechanism.

This patch fixes the problem by moving the feature check
to i40e_sw_init in order to set a flag in pf->hw_features
that ethtool will use for priv_flags disable operation.
