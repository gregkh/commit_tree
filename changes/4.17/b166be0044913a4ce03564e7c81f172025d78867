hwrng: omap - Fix clock resource by adding a register clock

On Armada 7K/8K we need to explicitly enable the register clock. This
clock is optional because not all the SoCs using this IP need it but at
least for Armada 7K/8K it is actually mandatory.

The binding documentation is updating accordingly.
