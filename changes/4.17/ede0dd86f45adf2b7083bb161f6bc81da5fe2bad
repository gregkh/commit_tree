drm/amdgpu: Add kfd2kgd interface to acquire an existing VM

This allows acquiring an existing VM from a render node FD to use it
for a compute process.

Such VMs get destroyed when the original file descriptor is released.
Added a callback from amdgpu_vm_fini to handle KFD VM destruction
correctly in this case.

v2:
* Removed vm->vm_context check in amdgpu_amdkfd_gpuvm_destroy_cb,
  check vm->process_info earlier instead
