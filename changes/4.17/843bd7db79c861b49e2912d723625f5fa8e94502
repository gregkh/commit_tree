cxgb4: Setup FW queues before registering netdev

When NetworkManager is enabled, there are chances that interface up
is called even before probe completes. This means we have not yet
allocated the FW sge queues, hence rest of ingress queue allocation
wont be proper. Fix this by calling setup_fw_sge_queues() before
register_netdev().
