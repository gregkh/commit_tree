drivers: base: Unified device connection lookup

Several frameworks - clk, gpio, phy, pmw, etc. - maintain
lookup tables for describing connections and provide custom
API for handling them. This introduces a single generic
lookup table and API for the connections.

The motivation for this commit is centralizing the
connection lookup, but the goal is to ultimately extract the
connection descriptions also from firmware by using the
fwnode_graph_* functions and other mechanisms that are
available.
