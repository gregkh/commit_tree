drm/sun4i: Handle DRM_BUS_FLAG_PIXDATA_*EDGE

Handle both positive and negative dclk polarity,
according to bus_flags, taking care of this:

On A20 and similar SoCs, the only way to achieve Positive Edge
(Rising Edge), is setting dclk clock phase to 2/3(240°).
By default TCON works in Negative Edge(Falling Edge), this is why phase
is set to 0 in that case.
Unfortunately there's no way to logically invert dclk through IO_POL
register.
The only acceptable way to work, triple checked with scope,
is using clock phase set to 0° for Negative Edge and set to 240° for
Positive Edge.
On A33 and similar SoCs there would be a 90° phase option, but it divides
also dclk by 2.
This patch is a way to avoid quirks all around TCON and DOTCLOCK drivers
for using A33 90° phase divided by 2 and consequently increase code
complexity.
