mm,vmscan: Allow preallocating memory for register_shrinker().

syzbot is catching so many bugs triggered by commit 9ee332d99e4d5a97
("sget(): handle failures of register_shrinker()"). That commit expected
that calling kill_sb() from deactivate_locked_super() without successful
fill_super() is safe, but the reality was different; some callers assign
attributes which are needed for kill_sb() after sget() succeeds.

For example, [1] is a report where sb->s_mode (which seems to be either
FMODE_READ | FMODE_EXCL | FMODE_WRITE or FMODE_READ | FMODE_EXCL) is not
assigned unless sget() succeeds. But it does not worth complicate sget()
so that register_shrinker() failure path can safely call
kill_block_super() via kill_sb(). Making alloc_super() fail if memory
allocation for register_shrinker() failed is much simpler. Let's avoid
calling deactivate_locked_super() from sget_userns() by preallocating
memory for the shrinker and making register_shrinker() in sget_userns()
never fail.
