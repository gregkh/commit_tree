fs: add do_compat_select() helper; remove in-kernel call to compat syscall

Using the fs-internal do_compat_select() helper allows us to get rid of
the fs-internal call to the compat_sys_select() syscall.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
