Revert "ata: ahci-platform: add reset control support"

This reverts commit f0f56716fc3e5d547fd7811eb218a30ed0695605.

According to Thierry's view,
https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-ide/msg55357.html
some hardware-specific drivers already use their own resets,
and the common reset might make a path to occur double controls of resets.

For now, revert the commit that adds reset control support to ahci-platform,
and hold until the solution is confirmed not be affect all hardware-specific
drivers.
