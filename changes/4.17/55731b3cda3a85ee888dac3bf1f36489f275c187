fs: add do_fchownat(), ksys_fchown() helpers and ksys_{,l}chown() wrappers

Using the fs-interal do_fchownat() wrapper allows us to get rid of
fs-internal calls to the sys_fchownat() syscall.

Introducing the ksys_fchown() helper and the ksys_{,}chown() wrappers
allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the sys_{,l,f}chown() syscalls.
The ksys_ prefix denotes that these functions are meant as a drop-in
replacement for the syscalls. In particular, they use the same calling
convention as sys_{,l,f}chown().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
