ARM: dts: exynos: Add missing clock and DAI properties to the max98095 node in Snow Chromebook

This patch adds missing clocks, clock-names properties so the CODEC can
properly handle its master clock. Without this change sound on exynos5250-snow
doesn't work.
Missing #sound-dai-cells property is also added so it is possible to specify
the DAI links properly for HDMI audio support.
