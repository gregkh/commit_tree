ACPI / PM: Blacklist Low Power S0 Idle _DSM for ThinkPad X1 Tablet(2016)

ThinkPad X1 Tablet(2016) is reported to have issues with
the Low Power S0 Idle _DSM interface and since this machine
model generally can do ACPI S3 just fine, and user would
like to use S3 as default sleep model, add a blacklist
entry to disable that interface for ThinkPad X1 Tablet(2016).
