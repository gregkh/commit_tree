powerpc: Fix oops due to bad access of lppaca on bare metal

Commit 8e0b634b1327 ("powerpc/64s: Do not allocate lppaca if we are
not virtualized") removed allocation of lppaca on bare metal
platforms. But with CONFIG_PPC_SPLPAR enabled, we still access the
lppaca on bare metal in some code paths.

Fix this but adding runtime checks for SPLPAR (shared processor LPAR).
