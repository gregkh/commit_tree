ARM: dts: sun8i: h3: Re-enable EMAC on Orange Pi One

In commit f0842bc5637c ("ARM: dts: sun8i: h3: Enable HDMI output on H3
boards"), the hunk that enabled HDMI for the Orange Pi One did not add a

    status = "okay";

line for the HDMI node, inadvertenly using the one for the EMAC. This
resulted in the EMAC now being disabled. Whether this was due to a
rebase error or some other mishap is unknown.

This patch re-enables the EMAC by adding the status line to its node.
