KVM: x86: KVM_CAP_SYNC_REGS

This commit implements an enhanced x86 version of S390
KVM_CAP_SYNC_REGS functionality. KVM_CAP_SYNC_REGS "allow[s]
userspace to access certain guest registers without having
to call SET/GET_*REGS”. This reduces ioctl overhead which
is particularly important when userspace is making synchronous
guest state modifications (e.g. when emulating and/or intercepting
instructions).

Originally implemented upstream for the S390, the x86 differences
follow:
- userspace can select the register sets to be synchronized with kvm_run
using bit-flags in the kvm_valid_registers and kvm_dirty_registers
fields.
- vcpu_events is available in addition to the regs and sregs register
sets.
