mm, oom: remove 3% bonus for CAP_SYS_ADMIN processes

Since the 2.6 kernel, the oom killer has slightly biased away from
CAP_SYS_ADMIN processes by discounting some of its memory usage in
comparison to other processes.

This has always been implicit and nothing exactly relies on the
behavior.

Gaurav notices that __task_cred() can dereference a potentially freed
pointer if the task under consideration is exiting because a reference
to the task_struct is not held.

Remove the CAP_SYS_ADMIN bias so that all processes are treated equally.

If any CAP_SYS_ADMIN process would like to be biased against, it is
always allowed to adjust /proc/pid/oom_score_adj.
