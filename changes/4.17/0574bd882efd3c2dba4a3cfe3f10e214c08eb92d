drm/i915: Reject odd pipe source width with double wide/dual link

In order to guarantee that pipe_src_w/h matches the user mode h/vdisplay
we must not adjust pipe_src_w to accommodate double wide/dual link.
Instead just reject the mode outright.

This will allows us to rely on crtc_state->mode for plane clipping.
