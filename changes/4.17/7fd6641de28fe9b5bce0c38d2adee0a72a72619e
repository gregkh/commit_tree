powerpc/powernv/memtrace: Let the arch hotunplug code flush cache

Don't do this via custom code, instead now that we have support in the
arch hotplug/hotunplug code, rely on those routines to do the right
thing.

The existing flush doesn't work because it uses ppc64_caches.l1d.size
instead of ppc64_caches.l1d.line_size.
