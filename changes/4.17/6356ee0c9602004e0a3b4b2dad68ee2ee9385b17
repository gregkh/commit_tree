x86: Delay skip of emulated hypercall instruction

The IP increment should be done after the hypercall emulation, after
calling the various handlers. In this way, these handlers can accurately
identify the the IP of the VMCALL if they need it.

This patch keeps the same functionality for the Hyper-V handler which does
not use the return code of the standard kvm_skip_emulated_instruction()
call.
