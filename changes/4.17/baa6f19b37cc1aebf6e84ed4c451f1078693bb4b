There are some troubles on this driver with respect to the usage
of __be16 and __b32 macros:

	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1857:27: warning: incorrect type in initializer (different base types)
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1857:27:    expected unsigned short [unsigned] [usertype] reg_addr_be
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1857:27:    got restricted __be16 [usertype] <noident>
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1880:16: warning: cast to restricted __be32
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1880:16: warning: cast to restricted __be32
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1880:16: warning: cast to restricted __be32
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1880:16: warning: cast to restricted __be32
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1880:16: warning: cast to restricted __be32
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1880:16: warning: cast to restricted __be32
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1901:13: warning: incorrect type in assignment (different base types)
	drivers/media/i2c/ov5670.c:1901:13:    expected unsigned int [unsigned] [usertype] val
