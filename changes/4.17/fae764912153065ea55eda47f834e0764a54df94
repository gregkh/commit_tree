s390/signal: cleanup uapi struct sigaction

The struct sigaction for user space in arch/s390/include/uapi/asm/signal.h
is ill defined. The kernel uses two structures 'struct sigaction' and
'struct old_sigaction', the correlation in the kernel for both 31 and
64 bit is as follows

    sys_sigaction -> struct old_sigaction
    sys_rt_sigaction -> struct sigaction

The correlation of the (single) uapi definition for 'struct sigaction'
under '#ifndef __KERNEL__':

    31-bit: sys_sigaction -> uapi struct sigaction
    31-bit: sys_rt_sigaction -> no structure available

    64-bit: sys_sigaction -> no structure available
    64-bit: sys_rt_sigaction -> uapi struct sigaction

This is quite confusing. To make it a bit less confusing make the
uapi definition of 'struct sigaction' usable for sys_rt_sigaction for
both 31-bit and 64-bit.
