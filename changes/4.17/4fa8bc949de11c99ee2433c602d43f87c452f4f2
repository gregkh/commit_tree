kbuild: rename *-asn1.[ch] to *.asn1.[ch]

Our convention is to distinguish file types by suffixes with a period
as a separator.

*-asn1.[ch] is a different pattern from other generated sources such
as *.lex.c, *.tab.[ch], *.dtb.S, etc.  More confusing, files with
'-asn1.[ch]' are generated files, but '_asn1.[ch]' are checked-in
files:
  net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_asn1.c
  include/linux/netfilter/nf_conntrack_h323_asn1.h
  include/linux/sunrpc/gss_asn1.h

Rename generated files to *.asn1.[ch] for consistency.
