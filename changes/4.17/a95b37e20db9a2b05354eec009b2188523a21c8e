kbuild: get <linux/compiler_types.h> out of <linux/kconfig.h>

Since commit 28128c61e08e ("kconfig.h: Include compiler types to avoid
missed struct attributes"), <linux/kconfig.h> pulls in kernel-space
headers to unrelated places.

Commit 0f9da844d877 ("MIPS: boot: Define __ASSEMBLY__ for its.S build")
suppress the build error by defining __ASSEMBLY__, but ITS (i.e. DTS)
is not assembly, and should not include <linux/compiler_types.h> in the
first place.

Looking at arch/s390/tools/Makefile, host programs gen_facilities and
gen_opcode_table now pull in <linux/compiler_types.h> as well.

The motivation for that commit was to define necessary attributes
before any struct is defined.  Obviously, this happens only in C.

It is enough to include <linux/compiler_types.h> only when compiling
C files, and only when compiling kernel space.  Move the include to
c_flags.
