ALSA: hda - Silence PM ops build warning

The system sleep PM ops azx_suspend() and azx_resume() were previously
called by vga_switcheroo, but commit 07f4f97d7b4b ("vga_switcheroo: Use
device link for HDA controller") removed their invocation.

Unfortunately the commit neglected to update the #ifdef surrounding the
two functions, so if CONFIG_PM_SLEEP is *not* enabled but all three of
CONFIG_PM, CONFIG_VGA_SWITCHEROO and CONFIG_SND_HDA_CODEC_HDMI *are*
enabled, the compiler now emits the following warning:

sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:1024:12: warning: 'azx_resume' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
 static int azx_resume(struct device *dev)
            ^~~~~~~~~~
sound/pci/hda/hda_intel.c:989:12: warning: 'azx_suspend' defined but not used [-Wunused-function]
 static int azx_suspend(struct device *dev)
            ^~~~~~~~~~~

Silence by updating the #ifdef.  Because the #ifdef block now uses the
same condition as the one immediately succeeding it, the two blocks can
be collapsed together, shaving off another two lines.
