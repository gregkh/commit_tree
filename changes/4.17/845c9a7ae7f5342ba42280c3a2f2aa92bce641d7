ipmr, ip6mr: Unite logic for searching in MFC cache

ipmr and ip6mr utilize the exact same methods for searching the
hashed resolved connections, difference being only in the construction
of the hash comparison key.

In order to unite the flow, introduce an mr_table operation set that
would contain the protocol specific information required for common
flows, in this case - the hash parameters and a comparison key
representing a (*,*) route.
