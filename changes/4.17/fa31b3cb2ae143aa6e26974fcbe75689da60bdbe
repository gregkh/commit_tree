xhci: Add Intel extended cap / otg phy mux handling

The xHCI controller on various Intel SoCs has an extended cap mmio-range
which contains registers to control the muxing to the xHCI (host mode)
or the dwc3 (device mode) and vbus-detection for the otg usb-phy.

Having a role-sw driver included in the xHCI code (under drivers/usb/host)
is not desirable. So this commit adds a simple handler for this extended
capability, which creates a platform device with the caps mmio region as
resource, this allows us to write a separate platform role-sw driver for
the role-switch.

Note this commit adds a call to the new xhci_ext_cap_init() function
to xhci_pci_probe(), it is added here because xhci_ext_cap_init() must
be called only once. If in the future we also want to handle ext-caps
on non pci xHCI HCDs from xhci_ext_cap_init() a call to it should also
be added to other bus probe paths.
