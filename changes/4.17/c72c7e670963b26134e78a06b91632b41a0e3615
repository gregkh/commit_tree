x86: kexec_file: remove X86_64 dependency from prepare_elf64_headers()

The code guarded by CONFIG_X86_64 is necessary on some architectures
which have a dedicated kernel mapping outside of linear memory mapping.
(arm64 is among those.)

In this patch, an additional argument, kernel_map, is added to enable/
disable the code removing #ifdef.
