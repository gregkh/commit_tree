drm/i915: Tidy up some error messages around reset failure

On blb and pnv, we are seeing sporadic

  i915 0000:00:02.0: Resetting chip after gpu hang
  [drm:intel_gpu_reset [i915]] rcs0: timed out on STOP_RING
  [drm:i915_reset [i915]] *ERROR* Failed hw init on reset -5

which notably lack the actual root cause of the error. Ostensibly it
should be the init_ring_common() that failed, but it's error paths are
covered by DRM_ERROR.
