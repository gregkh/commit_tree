linux/const.h: prefix include guard of uapi/linux/const.h with _UAPI

Patch series "linux/const.h: cleanups of macros such as UL(), _BITUL(),
BIT() etc", v3.

ARM, ARM64, UniCore32 define UL() as a shorthand of _AC(..., UL).  More
architectures may introduce it in the future.

UL() is arch-agnostic, and useful. So let's move it to
include/linux/const.h

Currently, <asm/memory.h> must be included to use UL().  It pulls in more
bloats just for defining some bit macros.

I posted V2 one year ago.

At that time, what blocked this series was a comment from
David Howells:
  You need to be very careful doing this.  Some userspace stuff
  depends on the guard macro names on the kernel header files.

Looking at the code closer, I noticed this is not a problem.

See the following line.
https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/v4.16-rc2/scripts/headers_install.sh#L40

scripts/headers_install.sh rips off _UAPI prefix from guard macro names.

I ran "make headers_install" and confirmed the result is what I expect.

So, we can prefix the include guard of include/uapi/linux/const.h,
and add a new include/linux/const.h.

This patch (of 4):

I am going to add include/linux/const.h for the kernel space.

Add _UAPI to the include guard of include/uapi/linux/const.h to
prepare for that.

Please notice the guard name of the exported one will be kept as-is.
So, this commit has no impact to the userspace even if some userspace
stuff depends on the guard macro names.

scripts/headers_install.sh processes exported headers by SED, and
rips off "_UAPI" from guard macro names.

  #ifndef _UAPI_LINUX_CONST_H
  #define _UAPI_LINUX_CONST_H

will be turned into

  #ifndef _LINUX_CONST_H
  #define _LINUX_CONST_H
