USB: misc: uss720: more vendor/product ID's

Reporting two more VID/PID pairs that work with this driver, having used
an informational webpage <http://reboots.g-cipher.net/lcd/> as a buying
guide now. The page listed additional working VID/PID pairs but did not
include these two. None were upstreamed. Also taking this opportunity to
sort the pairs numerically.

Of the two such cables now in my possession, one is white, bearing the
In-System Design ISD-103 label on one side, sold as an Epson CAEUL0002
"USB to Parallel Smart Cable For Apple Macintosh Computers" (04b8:0002),
and the other is black, bearing the In-System Design ISD-101 label on one
side, sold as an early Belkin F5U002 (05ab:0002).
