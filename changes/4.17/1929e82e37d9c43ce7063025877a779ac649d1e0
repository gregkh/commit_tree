scsi: bfa: remove VLA

In preparation to enabling -Wvla, remove VLAs and replace them with
fixed-length arrays instead.

bfad_bsg.c uses a variable-length array declaration to measure the
size of a putative array; this can be replaced by the product of the
size of an element and the number of elements, avoiding the VLA
altogether.
