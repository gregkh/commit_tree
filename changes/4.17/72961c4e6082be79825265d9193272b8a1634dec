bfq-iosched: ensure to clear bic/bfqq pointers when preparing request

Even if we don't have an IO context attached to a request, we still
need to clear the priv[0..1] pointers, as they could be pointing
to previously used bic/bfqq structures. If we don't do so, we'll
either corrupt memory on dispatching a request, or cause an
imbalance in counters.

Inspired by a fix from Kees.
