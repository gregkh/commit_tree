ARM: OMAP: Move dmtimer driver out of plat-omap to drivers under clocksource

Move the dmtimer driver out of plat-omap to clocksource.
So that non-omap devices also could use this.

No Code changes done to the driver file only renamed to timer-ti-dm.c.
Also removed the config dependencies for OMAP_DM_TIMER.
