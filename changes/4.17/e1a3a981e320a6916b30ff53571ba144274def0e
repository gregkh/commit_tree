ALSA: pcm: Remove WARN_ON() at snd_pcm_hw_params() error

snd_pcm_hw_params() (more exactly snd_pcm_hw_params_choose()) contains
a check of the return error from snd_pcm_hw_param_first() and _last()
with snd_BUG_ON() -- i.e. it may trigger WARN_ON() depending on the
kconfig.

This was a valid check in the past, as these functions shouldn't
return any error if the parameters have been already refined via
snd_pcm_hw_refine() beforehand.  However, the recent rewrite
introduced a kmalloc() in snd_pcm_hw_refine() for removing VLA, and
this brought a possibility to trigger an error.  As a result, syzbot
caught lots of superfluous kernel WARN_ON() and paniced via fault
injection.

As the WARN_ON() is no longer valid with the introduction of
kmalloc(), let's drop snd_BUG_ON() check, in order to make the world
peaceful place again.
