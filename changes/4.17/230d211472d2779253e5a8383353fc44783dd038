xen: xen-pciback: Replace GFP_ATOMIC with GFP_KERNEL in xen_pcibk_config_quirks_init

xen_pcibk_config_quirks_init() is never called in atomic context.

The call chains ending up at xen_pcibk_config_quirks_init() are:
[1] xen_pcibk_config_quirks_init() <- xen_pcibk_config_init_dev() <-
	pcistub_init_device() <- pcistub_seize() <- pcistub_probe()
[2] xen_pcibk_config_quirks_init() <- xen_pcibk_config_init_dev() <-
	pcistub_init_device() <- pcistub_init_devices_late() <-
	xen_pcibk_init()
pcistub_probe() is only set as ".probe" in struct pci_driver.
xen_pcibk_init() is is only set as a parameter of module_init().
These functions are not called in atomic context.

Despite never getting called from atomic context,
xen_pcibk_config_quirks_init() calls kzalloc() with GFP_ATOMIC,
which does not sleep for allocation.
GFP_ATOMIC is not necessary and can be replaced with GFP_KERNEL,
which can sleep and improve the possibility of sucessful allocation.
