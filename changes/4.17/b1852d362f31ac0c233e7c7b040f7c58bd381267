drm/i915/guc: Fix return from guc_log_relay_file_create

guc_log_relay_file_create will return -EEXIST if we invoke
relay_late_setup_files multiple times as part of i915_guc_log_control.
However this is to be not cosidered as fail and need to return 0.
This was mistakenly introduced in the below commit. Fix it.
