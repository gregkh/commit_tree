blk-mq: Directly schedule q->timeout_work when aborting a request

Request abortion is performed by overriding deadline to now and
scheduling timeout handling immediately.  For the latter part, the
code was using mod_timer(timeout, 0) which can't guarantee that the
timer runs afterwards.  Let's schedule the underlying work item
directly instead.

This fixes the hangs during probing reported by Sitsofe but it isn't
yet clear to me how the failure can happen reliably if it's just the
above described race condition.
