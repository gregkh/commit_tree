of_net: Implement of_get_nvmem_mac_address helper

It's common practice to store MAC addresses for network interfaces into
nvmem devices. However the code to actually do this in the kernel lacks,
so this patch adds of_get_nvmem_mac_address() for drivers to obtain the
address from an nvmem cell provider.

This is particulary useful on devices where the ethernet interface cannot
be configured by the bootloader, for example because it's in an FPGA.
