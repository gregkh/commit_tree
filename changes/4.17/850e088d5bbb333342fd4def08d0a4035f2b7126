virtio-net: correctly check num_buf during err path

If we successfully linearize the packet, num_buf will be set to zero
which may confuse error handling path which assumes num_buf is at
least 1 and this can lead the code tries to pop the descriptor of next
buffer. Fixing this by checking num_buf against 1 before decreasing.
