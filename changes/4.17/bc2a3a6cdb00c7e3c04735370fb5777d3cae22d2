i40e: fix for wrong partition id calculation on OCP mezz cards

This patch overwrites number of ports for X722 devices with support
for OCP PHY mezzanine.
The old method with checking if port is disabled in the PRTGEN_CNF
register cannot be used in this case. When the OCP is removed, ports
were seen as disabled, which resulted in wrong calculation of partition
id, that caused WoL to be disabled on certain ports.
