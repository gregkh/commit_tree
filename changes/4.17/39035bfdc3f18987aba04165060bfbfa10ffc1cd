ixgbevf: ensure xdp_ring resources are free'd on error exit

The current error handling for failed resource setup for xdp_ring
data is a break out of the loop and returning 0 indicated everything
was OK, when in fact it is not.  Fix this by exiting via the
error exit label err_setup_tx that will clean up the resources
correctly and return and error status.
