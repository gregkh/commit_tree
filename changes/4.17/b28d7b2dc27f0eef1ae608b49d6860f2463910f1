tracing: Uninitialized variable in create_tracing_map_fields()

Smatch complains that idx can be used uninitialized when we check if
(idx < 0).  It has to be the first iteration through the loop and the
HIST_FIELD_FL_STACKTRACE bit has to be clear and the HIST_FIELD_FL_VAR
bit has to be set to reach the bug.
