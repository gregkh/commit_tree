bcma: Replace mdelay with usleep_range in bcma_pmu_resources_init

After checking all possible call chains to bcma_pmu_resources_init() here,
my tool finds that this function is never called in atomic context,
namely never in an interrupt handler or holding a spinlock.
Thus mdelay can be replaced with usleep_range to avoid busy wait.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
