xfrm: Register xfrm_dev_notifier in appropriate place

Currently, driver registers it from pernet_operations::init method,
and this breaks modularity, because initialization of net namespace
and netdevice notifiers are orthogonal actions. We don't have
per-namespace netdevice notifiers; all of them are global for all
devices in all namespaces.
