l2tp: fix race in duplicate tunnel detection

We can't use l2tp_tunnel_find() to prevent l2tp_nl_cmd_tunnel_create()
from creating a duplicate tunnel. A tunnel can be concurrently
registered after l2tp_tunnel_find() returns. Therefore, searching for
duplicates must be done at registration time.

Finally, remove l2tp_tunnel_find() entirely as it isn't use anywhere
anymore.
