scsi: lpfc: Work around NVME cmd iu SGL type

The hardware offload for NVME commands was created when the
FC-NVME standard was setting SGL Descriptor Type to SGL Data
Block Descriptor (0h) and SGL Descriptor Sub Type to Address (0h).

A late change in NVMe-over-Fabrics obsoleted these values, creating
a transport SGL descriptor type with new values to go into these
fields.

For initial hardware support, in order to be compliant to the spec,
use host-supplied cmd IU buffers instead of the adapter generated
values. Later hardware will correct this.

Add a module parameter to override this offload disablement if looking
for lowest latency. This is reasonable as nothing in FC-NVME uses
the SQE SGL values.
