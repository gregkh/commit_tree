KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: XIVE: Resend re-routed interrupts on CPU priority change

When a vcpu priority (CPPR) is set to a lower value (masking more
interrupts), we stop processing interrupts already in the queue
for the priorities that have now been masked.

If those interrupts were previously re-routed to a different
CPU, they might still be stuck until the older one that has
them in its queue processes them. In the case of guest CPU
unplug, that can be never.

To address that without creating additional overhead for
the normal interrupt processing path, this changes H_CPPR
handling so that when such a priority change occurs, we
scan the interrupt queue for that vCPU, and for any
interrupt in there that has been re-routed, we replace it
with a dummy and force a re-trigger.
