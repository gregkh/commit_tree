sctp: add SCTP_AUTH_NO_AUTH type for AUTHENTICATION_EVENT

This patch is to add SCTP_AUTH_NO_AUTH type for AUTHENTICATION_EVENT,
as described in section 6.1.8 of RFC6458.

      SCTP_AUTH_NO_AUTH:  This report indicates that the peer does not
         support SCTP authentication as defined in [RFC4895].

Note that the implementation is quite similar as that of
SCTP_ADAPTATION_INDICATION.
