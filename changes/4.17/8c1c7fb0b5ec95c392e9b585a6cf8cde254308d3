powerpc/64s/idle: avoid sync for KVM state when waking from idle

When waking from a CPU idle instruction (e.g., nap or stop), the sync
for ordering the KVM secondary thread state can be avoided if there
wakeup is coming from a kernel context rather than KVM context.

This improves performance for ping-pong benchmark with the stop0 idle
state by 0.46% for 2 threads in the same core, and 1.02% for different
cores.
