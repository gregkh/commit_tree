crypto: cavium - Replace mdelay with msleep in cpt_device_init

cpt_device_init() is never called in atomic context.

The call chain ending up at cpt_device_init() is:
[1] cpt_device_init() <- cpt_probe()
cpt_probe() is only set as ".probe" in pci_driver structure
"cpt_pci_driver".

Despite never getting called from atomic context, cpt_device_init() calls
mdelay(100), i.e. busy wait for 100ms.
That is not necessary and can be replaced with msleep to
avoid busy waiting.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
