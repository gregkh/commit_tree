clk: ti: fix flag space conflict with clkctrl clocks

The introduction of support for CLK_SET_RATE_PARENT flag for clkctrl
clocks used a generic clock flag, which causes a conflict with the
rest of the clkctrl flags, namely the NO_IDLEST flag. This can cause
boot failures on certain platforms where this flag is introduced, by
omitting the wait for the clockctrl module to be fully enabled before
proceeding with rest of the code.

Fix this by moving all the clkctrl specific flags to their own bit-range.
