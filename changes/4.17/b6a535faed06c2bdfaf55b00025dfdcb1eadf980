btrfs: print error if primary super block write fails

Presently, failing a primary super block write but succeeding in at
least one super block write in general will appear to users as if
nothing important went wrong. However, upon unmounting and re-mounting,
the file system will be in a rolled back state. This was discovered
with a BCC program that uses bpf_override_return() to fail super block
writes.

This patch outputs an error clarifying that the primary super block
write has failed, so users can expect potentially erroneous behaviour.
It also forces wait_dev_supers() to return an error to its caller if
the primary super block write fails.
