arm64: Enable ARM64_HARDEN_EL2_VECTORS on Cortex-A57 and A72

Cortex-A57 and A72 are vulnerable to the so-called "variant 3a" of
Meltdown, where an attacker can speculatively obtain the value
of a privileged system register.

By enabling ARM64_HARDEN_EL2_VECTORS on these CPUs, obtaining
VBAR_EL2 is not disclosing the hypervisor mappings anymore.
