drm/i915/icl: NV12 y-plane ddb is not in same plane

We don't have planar pixel format support implemented for ICL yet.
ICL require 2 display planes to be allocated for Planar formats unlike
previous GEN. So ICL/GEN11 doesn't require to write Y-plane ddb data in
NV12_BUF_CFG register and PLANE_NV12_BUF_CFG register is removed in ICL.

This patch removes the PLANE_NV12_BUF_CFG write for ICL.
