ARM: OMAP2+: Fix build when using split object directories

The sleep33xx and sleep43xx files should not depend on a header file
generated in drivers/memory. Remove this dependency and instead allow
both drivers/memory and arch/arm/mach-omap2 to generate all macros
needed in headers local to their own paths.

This fixes an issue where the build fail will when using O= to set a
split object directory and arch/arm/mach-omap2 is built before
drivers/memory with the following error:

.../drivers/memory/emif-asm-offsets.c:1:0: fatal error: can't open
drivers/memory/emif-asm-offsets.s for writing: No such file or directory
compilation terminated.
