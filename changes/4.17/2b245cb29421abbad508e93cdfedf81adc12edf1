ice: Implement transmit and NAPI support

This patch implements ice_start_xmit (the handler for ndo_start_xmit) and
related functions. ice_start_xmit ultimately calls ice_tx_map, where the
Tx descriptor is built and posted to the hardware by bumping the ring tail.

This patch also implements ice_napi_poll, which is invoked when there's an
interrupt on the VSI's queues. The interrupt can be due to either a
completed Tx or an Rx event. In case of a completed Tx/Rx event, resources
are reclaimed. Additionally, in case of an Rx event, the skb is fetched
and passed up to the network stack.
