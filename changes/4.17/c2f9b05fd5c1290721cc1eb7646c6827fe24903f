media: arch: sh: ecovec: Use new renesas-ceu camera driver

SH4 7724 Ecovec platform uses sh_mobile_ceu camera driver, which is now
being replaced by a proper V4L2 camera driver named 'renesas-ceu'.

Get rid of soc_camera defined components used to register sensor drivers
and of platform specific enable/disable routines.

Register GPIOs for sensor drivers and declare memory reserved with
memblock APIs as dma capable to be used for CEU buffers.

While at there re-order include directives to respect alphabetical
ordering.
