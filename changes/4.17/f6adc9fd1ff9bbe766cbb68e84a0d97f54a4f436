ARM: davinci: da8xx: simplify CFGCHIP regmap_config

Since commit 8253bb3f8255 ("regmap: potentially duplicate the name
string stored in regmap"), the name field of struct regmap_config
is copied in __regmap_init(), so we no longer need to worry about
keeping our own copy of the name.

Just use a string literal in the initialization of da8xx_cfgchip_config
instead of creating a separate variable for the name.
