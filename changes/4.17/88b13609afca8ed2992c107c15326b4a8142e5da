scsi: aic7xxx: aic79xx: remove VLAs

In preparation to enabling -Wvla, remove VLAs and replace them with
fixed-length arrays instead.

The arrays fixed here, using the number of constant sections, aren't
really VLAs, but they appear so to the compiler. Replace the array sizes
with a pre-processor-level constant instead using ARRAY_SIZE.
