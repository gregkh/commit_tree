bcma: add HP Stream Notebook

In this laptop we have the following PCI device:
02:00.0 Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Limited BCM43142 802.11b/g/n [14e4:4365] (rev 01)
	Subsystem: Hewlett-Packard Company BCM43142 802.11b/g/n [103c:804a]
	[...]
	Region 0: Memory at 91000000 (64-bit, non-prefetchable) [size=32K]
	[...]

With this patch, we can now see its WiFi chip:
  bcma: bus0: Found chip with id 43142, rev 0x01 and package 0x08
  bcma: bus0: Core 0 found: ChipCommon (manuf 0x4BF, id 0x800, rev 0x28, class 0x0)

  bcma: bus0: Workarounds unknown or not needed for device 0xA886

But it not yet supported by brcmsmac so it won't work for now:
  brcmsmac bcma0:1: brcms_b_attach wl0: vendor 0x14e4 device 0x4365
  brcmsmac: unknown device id 4365
