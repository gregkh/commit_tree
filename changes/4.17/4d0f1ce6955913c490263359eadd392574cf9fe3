xen/acpi: upload _PSD info for non Dom0 CPUs too

All uploaded PM data from non-dom0 CPUs takes the info from vCPU 0 and
changing only the acpi_id. For processors which P-state coordination type
is HW_ALL (0xFD) it is OK to upload bogus P-state dependency information
(_PSD), because Xen will ignore any cpufreq domains created for past CPUs.

Albeit for platforms which expose coordination types as SW_ANY or SW_ALL,
this will have some unintended side effects. Effectively, it will look at
the P-state domain existence and *if it already exists* it will skip the
acpi-cpufreq initialization and thus inherit the policy from the first CPU
in the cpufreq domain. This will finally lead to the original cpu not
changing target freq to P0 other than the first in the domain. Which will
make turbo boost not getting enabled (e.g. for 'performance' governor) for
all cpus.

This patch fixes that, by also evaluating _PSD when we enumerate all ACPI
processors and thus always uploading the correct info to Xen. We export
acpi_processor_get_psd() for that this purpose, but change signature
to not assume an existent of acpi_processor given that ACPI isn't creating
an acpi_processor for non-dom0 CPUs.
