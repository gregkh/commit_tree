mac80211: agg-rx: Accept ADDBA request update if timeout did not change

As there is no support for updating an existing ADDBA session with
a peer, we decline the request (while keeping the session active).
However, in case that the timeout did not change, there is no need
to decline the request, so modify the code to reply with status success
in such a case (this is useful for interoperability with APs that send an
ADDBA request update without changing the timeout value).
