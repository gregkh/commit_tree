drm/bridge/synopsys: dw-hdmi: don't clobber drvdata

dw_hdmi shouldn't set drvdata since some drivers might need to store
it's own data there. Rework dw_hdmi in a way to return struct dw_hdmi
instead to store it in drvdata. This way drivers are responsible to
store and pass structure when needed.

Idea was taken from the following commit:
8242ecbd597d ("drm/bridge/synopsys: stop clobbering drvdata")
