tracing: Add simple expression support to hist triggers

Add support for simple addition, subtraction, and unary expressions
(-(expr) and expr, where expr = b-a, a+b, a+b+c) to hist triggers, in
order to support a minimal set of useful inter-event calculations.

These operations are needed for calculating latencies between events
(timestamp1-timestamp0) and for combined latencies (latencies over 3
or more events).

In the process, factor out some common code from key and value
parsing.
