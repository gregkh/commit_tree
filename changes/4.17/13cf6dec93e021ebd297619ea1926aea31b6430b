cfg80211/nl80211: add DFS offload flag

Add wiphy EXT_FEATURE flag to indicate that HW or driver does
all DFS actions by itself.
User-space functionality already implemented in hostapd using
vendor-specific (QCA) OUI to advertise DFS offload support.
Need to introduce generic flag to inform about DFS offload support.
For devices with DFS_OFFLOAD flag set user-space will no longer
need to issue CAC or do any actions in response to
"radar detected" events. HW will do everything by itself and send
events to user-space to indicate that CAC was started/finished, etc.
