KVM: arm64: Introduce separate VHE/non-VHE sysreg save/restore functions

As we are about to handle system registers quite differently between VHE
and non-VHE systems.  In preparation for that, we need to split some of
the handling functions between VHE and non-VHE functionality.

For now, we simply copy the non-VHE functions, but we do change the use
of static keys for VHE and non-VHE functionality now that we have
separate functions.
