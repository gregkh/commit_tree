treewide: remove large struct-pass-by-value from tracepoint arguments

- fix trace_hfi1_ctxt_info() to pass large struct by reference instead of by value
- convert 'type array[]' tracepoint arguments into 'type *array',
  since compiler will warn that sizeof('type array[]') == sizeof('type *array')
  and later should be used instead

The CAST_TO_U64 macro in the later patch will enforce that tracepoint
arguments can only be integers, pointers, or less than 8 byte structures.
Larger structures should be passed by reference.
