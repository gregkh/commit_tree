drm/radeon: insist on 32-bit DMA for Cedar on PPC64/PPC64LE

In radeon_device_init, set the need_dma32 flag for Cedar chips
(e.g. FirePro 2270).  This fixes, or at least works around, a bug
on PowerPC exposed by last year's commits

8e3f1b1d8255105f31556aacf8aeb6071b00d469 (Russell Currey)

and

253fd51e2f533552ae35a0c661705da6c4842c1b (Alistair Popple)

which enabled the 64-bit DMA iommu bypass.

This caused the device to freeze, in some cases unrecoverably, and is
the subject of several bug reports internal to Red Hat.
