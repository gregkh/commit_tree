ARM: dts: artpec: migrate ethernet to stmmac binding

The snps,dwc-qos-ethernet binding is still supported as a glue layer
in the stmmac driver.
However, since the snps,dwc-qos-ethernet binding is now deprecated,
migrate to stmmac's native binding.

At the same time, enable features supported by the stmmac driver,
such as PTP, LPI, and an additional tx queue.
