ipv4: fix memory leaks in udp_sendmsg, ping_v4_sendmsg

Fix more memory leaks in ip_cmsg_send() callers. Part of them were fixed
earlier in 919483096bfe.

* udp_sendmsg one was there since the beginning when linux sources were
  first added to git;
* ping_v4_sendmsg one was copy/pasted in c319b4d76b9e.

Whenever return happens in udp_sendmsg() or ping_v4_sendmsg() IP options
have to be freed if they were allocated previously.

Add label so that future callers (if any) can use it instead of kfree()
before return that is easy to forget.

Fixes: c319b4d76b9e (net: ipv4: add IPPROTO_ICMP socket kind)
