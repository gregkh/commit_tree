btrfs: volumes: Remove the meaningless condition of minimal nr_devs when allocating a chunk

When checking the minimal nr_devs, there is one dead and meaningless
condition:

if (ndevs < devs_increment * sub_stripes || ndevs < devs_min) {
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This condition is meaningless, @devs_increment has nothing to do with
@sub_stripes.

In fact, in btrfs_raid_array[], profile with sub_stripes larger than 1
(RAID10) already has the @devs_increment set to 2.
So no need to multiple it by @sub_stripes.

And above condition is also dead.
For RAID10, @devs_increment * @sub_stripes equals 4, which is also the
@devs_min of RAID10.
For other profiles, @sub_stripes is always 1, and since @ndevs is
rounded down to @devs_increment, the condition will always be true.

Remove the meaningless condition to make later reader wander less.
