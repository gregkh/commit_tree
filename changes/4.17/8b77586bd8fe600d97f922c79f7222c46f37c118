RDMA/ucma: Check for a cm_id->device in all user calls that need it

This is done by auditing all callers of ucma_get_ctx and switching the
ones that unconditionally touch ->device to ucma_get_ctx_dev. This covers
a little less than  half of the call sites.

The 11 remaining call sites to ucma_get_ctx() were manually audited.
