i915/drrs/debugfs: psr status info addition

Existing debugfs entry i915_drrs_status is updated with whether PSR
is the cause for DRRS disabled state.

[v2]: Dropped the module parameter details as ctl moved from module
      parameter to debugfs. [Rodrigo]

[v3]: Crtc ID information is dropped as there is no immediate usecase.
      [Rodrigo].
