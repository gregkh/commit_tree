arm64: cpufeature: Relocate PAN emulation report

The PAN emulation notification was only happening for non-boot CPUs
if CPU capabilities had already been configured. This seems to be the
wrong place, as it's system-wide and isn't attached to capabilities,
so its reporting didn't normally happen. Instead, report it once from
the boot CPU.

Before (missing PAN emulation report):

 SMP: Total of 4 processors activated.
 CPU features: detected feature: 32-bit EL0 Support
 CPU features: detected feature: Kernel page table isolation (KPTI)
 CPU: All CPU(s) started at EL2

After:

 SMP: Total of 4 processors activated.
 CPU features: detected feature: 32-bit EL0 Support
 CPU features: detected feature: Kernel page table isolation (KPTI)
 CPU features: emulated: Privileged Access Never (PAN) using TTBR0_EL1 switching
 CPU: All CPU(s) started at EL2
