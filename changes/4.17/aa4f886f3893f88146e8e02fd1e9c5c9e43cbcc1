firmware: arm_scmi: add basic driver infrastructure for SCMI

The SCMI is intended to allow OSPM to manage various functions that are
provided by the hardware platform it is running on, including power and
performance functions. SCMI provides two levels of abstraction, protocols
and transports. Protocols define individual groups of system control and
management messages. A protocol specification describes the messages
that it supports. Transports describe the method by which protocol
messages are communicated between agents and the platform.

This patch adds basic infrastructure to manage the message allocation,
initialisation, packing/unpacking and shared memory management.
