mm/memory_hotplug: don't read nid from struct page during hotplug

During memory hotplugging the probe routine will leave struct pages
uninitialized, the same as it is currently done during boot.  Therefore,
we do not want to access the inside of struct pages before
__init_single_page() is called during onlining.

Because during hotplug we know that pages in one memory block belong to
the same numa node, we can skip the checking.  We should keep checking
for the boot case.
