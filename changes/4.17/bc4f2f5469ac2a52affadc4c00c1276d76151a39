taint: add taint for randstruct

Since the randstruct plugin can intentionally produce extremely unusual
kernel structure layouts (even performance pathological ones), some
maintainers want to be able to trivially determine if an Oops is coming
from a randstruct-built kernel, so as to keep their sanity when
debugging.  This adds the new flag and initializes taint_mask
immediately when built with randstruct.
