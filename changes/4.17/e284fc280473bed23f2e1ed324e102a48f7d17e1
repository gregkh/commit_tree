i40e: Add and delete cloud filter

This patch provides support to add or delete cloud filter for queue
channels created for ADq on VF.
We are using the HW's cloud filter feature and programming it to act
as a TC filter applied to a group of queues.

There are two possible modes for a VF when applying a cloud filter
1. Basic Mode:	Intended to apply filters that don't need a VF to be
		Trusted. This would include the following
		  Dest MAC + L4 port
		  Dest MAC + VLAN + L4 port
2. Advanced Mode: This mode is only for filters with combination that
		  requires VF to be Trusted.
		  Dest IP + L4 port

When cloud filters are applied on a trusted VF and for some reason
the same VF is later made as untrusted then all cloud filters
will be deleted. All cloud filters has to be re-applied in
such a case.
Cloud filters are also deleted when queue channel is deleted.

Testing-Hints:
=============
1. Adding Basic Mode filter should be possible on a VF in
   Non-Trusted mode.
2. In Advanced mode all filters should be able to be created.

Steps:
======
1. Enable ADq and create TCs using TC mqprio command
2. Apply cloud filter.
3. Turn-off the spoof check.
4. Pass traffic.

Example:
========
1. tc qdisc add dev enp4s2 root mqprio num_tc 4 map 0 0 0 0 1 2 2 3\
	queues 2@0 2@2 1@4 1@5 hw 1 mode channel
2. tc qdisc add dev enp4s2 ingress
3. ethtool -K enp4s2 hw-tc-offload on
4. ip link set ens261f0 vf 0 spoofchk off
5. tc filter add dev enp4s2 protocol ip parent ffff: prio 1 flower\
	dst_ip 192.168.3.5/32 ip_proto udp dst_port 25 skip_sw hw_tc 2
