RDMA/iwpm: fix memory leak on map_info

In the cases where iwpm_hash_bucket is NULL and where function
get_mapinfo_hash_bucket returns NULL then the map_info is never added
to hash_bucket_head and hence there is a leak of map_info. Fix this
by nullifying hash_bucket_head and if that is null we know that
that map_info was not added to hash_bucket_head and hence map_info
should be free'd.
