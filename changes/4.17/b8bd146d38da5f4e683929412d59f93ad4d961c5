fsi: master-gpio: Add external mode

This change introduces an 'external mode' for GPIO-based FSI masters,
allowing the clock and data lines to be driven by an external source.
For example, external mode is selected by a user when an external debug
device is attached to the FSI pins.

To do this, we need to set specific states for the trans, mux and enable
GPIOs, and prevent access to clk & data from the FSI core code (by
returning EBUSY).

External mode is controlled by a sysfs attribute, so add the relevant
information to Documentation/ABI/
