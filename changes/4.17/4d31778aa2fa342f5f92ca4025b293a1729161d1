btrfs: qgroup: Fix root item corruption when multiple same source snapshots are created with quota enabled

When multiple pending snapshots referring to the same source subvolume
are executed, enabled quota will cause root item corruption, where root
items are using old bytenr (no backref in extent tree).

This can be triggered by fstests btrfs/152.

The cause is when source subvolume is still dirty, extra commit
(simplied transaction commit) of qgroup_account_snapshot() can skip
dirty roots not recorded in current transaction, making root item of
source subvolume not updated.

Fix it by forcing recording source subvolume in current transaction
before qgroup sub-transaction commit.
