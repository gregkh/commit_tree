gpio: 104-idi-48: Implement get_multiple callback

The ACCES I/O 104-IDI-48 series of devices provides 48
optically-isolated inputs accessed via six 8-bit ports. Since eight
input lines are acquired on a single port input read, the 104-IDI-48
GPIO driver may improve multiple input reads by utilizing a get_multiple
callback. This patch implements the idi_48_gpio_get_multiple function
which serves as the respective get_multiple callback.
