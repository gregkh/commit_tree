3c59x: convert to generic DMA API

This driver supports EISA devices in addition to PCI devices, and relied
on the legacy behavior of the pci_dma* shims to pass on a NULL pointer
to the DMA API, and the DMA API being able to handle that.  When the
NULL forwarding broke the EISA support got broken.  Fix this by converting
to the DMA API instead of the legacy PCI shims.
