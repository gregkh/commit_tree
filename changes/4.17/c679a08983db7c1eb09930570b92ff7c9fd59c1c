syscalls: sort syscall prototypes in include/linux/compat.h

Shuffle the syscall prototypes in include/linux/compat.h around so
that they are kept in the same order as in
include/uapi/asm-generic/unistd.h. The individual entries are kept
the same, and neither modified to bring them in line with kernel coding
style nor wrapped in proper ifdefs -- as an exception to this, add the
prefix "asmlinkage" where it was missing.
