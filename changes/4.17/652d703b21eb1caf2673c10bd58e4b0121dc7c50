char_dev: Fix off-by-one bugs in find_dynamic_major()

CHRDEV_MAJOR_DYN_END and CHRDEV_MAJOR_DYN_EXT_END are valid major
numbers. So fix the loop iteration to include them in the search for
free major numbers.

While at it, also remove a redundant if condition ("cd->major != i"),
as it will never be true.
