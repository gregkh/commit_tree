pinctrl: cherryview: Associate IRQ descriptors to irqdomain

When we dropped the custom Linux GPIO translation it resulted that the
IRQ numbers changed slightly as well. Normally this would be fine
because everyone is expected to use controller relative GPIO numbers and
ACPI GpioIo/GpioInt resources. However, there is a certain set of
Intel_Strago based Chromebooks where i8042 keyboard controller IRQ
number is hardcoded be 182 (this is corrected with newer coreboot but
the older ones still have the hardcoded Linux IRQ number). Because of
this hardcoded IRQ number keyboard on those systems accidentally broke
again.

Fix this by iteratively associating IRQ descriptors to the chip irqdomain
so that there are no gaps on those systems. Other systems are not
affected.
