i2c: xlp9xx: Check for Bus state before every transfer

I2C bus enters the STOP condition after the DATA_DONE interrupt is raised.
Essentially the driver should be checking the bus state before sending
any transaction. In case a transaction is initiated while the
bus is busy, the prior transaction's stop condition is not achieved.
Add the check to make sure the bus is not busy before every transaction.
