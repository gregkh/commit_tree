libnvdimm, dimm: handle EACCES failures from label reads

The new support for the standard _LSR and _LSW methods neglected to also
update the nvdimm_init_config_data() and nvdimm_set_config_data() to
return the translated error code from failed commands. This precision is
necessary because the locked status that was previously returned on
ND_CMD_GET_CONFIG_SIZE commands is now returned on
ND_CMD_{GET,SET}_CONFIG_DATA commands.

If the kernel misses this indication it can inadvertently fall back to
label-less mode when it should otherwise avoid all access to locked
regions.
