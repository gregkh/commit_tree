drm/amd/display: Fix multiple definitions of handle_crc_irq

If CONFIG_DEBUG_FS is disabled, then CRC should also be disabled.
Therefore, amdgpu_dm_crtc_handle_crc_irq was redefined as a no-op
function within amdgpu_dm.h.

However, since amdgpu_dm.h is included in multiple files, this caused
conflicts when linking during compile. Therefore, Use a macro to
define the function as a no-op instead.
