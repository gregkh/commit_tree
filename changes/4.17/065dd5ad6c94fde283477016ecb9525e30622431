drm/i915/guc: Update name and prototype of i915_guc_log_control

i915_guc_log_control is GuC interface and GuC APIs that are not user
facing should be named with "intel_guc" prefix hence we change name to
intel_guc_log_control. Also changed the parameter to intel_guc struct.

v2: Move log vma check to intel_guc_log_control (Michal)
    Return -ENODEV when log isn't initialized. (Chris)
