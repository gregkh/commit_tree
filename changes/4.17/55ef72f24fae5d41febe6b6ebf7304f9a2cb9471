drm/i915: Remove spurious DRM_ERROR for cancelled interrupts

As we ourselves cancel interrupts during reset by clearing the GTIIR, it
is possible for the master IIR to indicate a pending IRQ for which we
have already cleared from the GTIIR. In this case, the DRM_ERROR are
intended and should not be flagged as an error.
