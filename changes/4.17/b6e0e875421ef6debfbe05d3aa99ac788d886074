net: systemport: Implement adaptive interrupt coalescing

Implement support for adaptive RX and TX interrupt coalescing using
net_dim. We have each of our TX ring and our single RX ring implement a
bcm_sysport_net_dim structure which holds an interrupt counter, number
of packets, bytes, and a container for a net_dim instance.
