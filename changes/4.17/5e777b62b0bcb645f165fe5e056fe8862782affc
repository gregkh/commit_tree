xfs: bmap scrubber should do rmap xref with bmap for sparse files

When we're scanning an extent mapping inode fork, ensure that every rmap
record for this ifork has a corresponding bmbt record too.  This
(mostly) provides the ability to cross-reference rmap records with bmap
data.  The rmap scrubber cannot do the xref on its own because that
requires taking an ilock with the agf lock held, which violates our
locking order rules (inode, then agf).

Note that we only do this for forks that are in btree format due to the
increased complexity; or forks that should have data but suspiciously
have zero extents because the inode could have just had its iforks
zapped by the inode repair code and now we need to reclaim the old
extents.
