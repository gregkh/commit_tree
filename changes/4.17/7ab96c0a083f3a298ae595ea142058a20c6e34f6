powerpc/wii: Probe the whole devicetree

Previously, wii_device_probe would only initialize devices under the
/hollywood node. After this patch, platform devices placed outside of
/hollywood will also be initialized.

The intended usecase for this are devices located outside of the
Hollywood chip, such as GPIO LEDs and GPIO buttons.
