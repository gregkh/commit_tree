KVM: VMX: use kvm_fast_pio_in for handling IN I/O

Fast emulation of processor I/O for IN was disabled on x86 (both VMX
and SVM) some years ago due to a buggy implementation.  The addition
of kvm_fast_pio_in(), used by SVM, re-introduced (functional!) fast
emulation of IN.  Piggyback SVM's work and use kvm_fast_pio_in() on
VMX instead of performing full emulation of IN.
