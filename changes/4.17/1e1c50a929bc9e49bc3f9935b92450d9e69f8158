btrfs: Fix possible softlock on single core machines

do_chunk_alloc implements a loop checking whether there is a pending
chunk allocation and if so causes the caller do loop. Generally this
loop is executed only once, however testing with btrfs/072 on a single
core vm machines uncovered an extreme case where the system could loop
indefinitely. This is due to a missing cond_resched when loop which
doesn't give a chance to the previous chunk allocator finish its job.

The fix is to simply add the missing cond_resched.
