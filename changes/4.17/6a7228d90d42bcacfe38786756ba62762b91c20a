ARM: amba: Fix race condition with driver_override

The driver_override implementation is susceptible to a race condition
when different threads are reading vs storing a different driver
override.  Add locking to avoid this race condition.

Cfr. commits 6265539776a0810b ("driver core: platform: fix race
condition with driver_override") and 9561475db680f714 ("PCI: Fix race
condition with driver_override").

Fixes: 3cf385713460eb2b ("ARM: 8256/1: driver coamba: add device binding path 'driver_override'")
