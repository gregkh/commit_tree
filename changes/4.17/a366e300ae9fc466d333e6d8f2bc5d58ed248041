ip6mr: remove synchronize_rcu() in favor of SOCK_RCU_FREE

Kirill found that recently added synchronize_rcu() call in
ip6mr_sk_done()
was slowing down netns dismantle and posted a patch to use it only if
the socket
was found.

I instead suggested to get rid of this call, and use instead
SOCK_RCU_FREE

We might later change IPv4 side to use the same technique and unify
both stacks. IPv4 does not use synchronize_rcu() but has a call_rcu()
that could be replaced by SOCK_RCU_FREE.

Tested:
 time for i in {1..1000}; do unshare -n /bin/false;done

 Before : real 7m18.911s
 After : real 10.187s
