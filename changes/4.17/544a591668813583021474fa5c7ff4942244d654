Revert "Bluetooth: btusb: Fix quirk for Atheros 1525/QCA6174"

Commit f44cb4b19ed4 ("Bluetooth: btusb: Fix quirk for Atheros
1525/QCA6174") is causing bluetooth to no longer work for several
people, see: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1568911

So lets revert it for now and try to find another solution for
devices which need the modified quirk.
