btrfs: keep device list sorted

By maintaining the device list sorted lets us reproduce the problems
related to missing chunk in the degraded mode much more consistent. So
fix this by sorting the devices by devid within the kernel. So that we
know which device is assigned to the struct fs_info::latest_bdev when
all the devices are having and same SB generation.
