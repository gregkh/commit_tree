staging: lustre: fix inverted test on strcmp

This code tests various fields to see if they are different, except
for one where there test is if they are the same.
This is clearly wrong for a function that is tesding for equality.

So change "!strcmp()" which I always find hard to read, to
"strcmp() != 0" which obviously means that the strings are not equal.
