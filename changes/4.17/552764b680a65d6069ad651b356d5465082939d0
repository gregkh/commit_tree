drm/amdkfd: Add TC flush on VMID deallocation for Hawaii

On GFX7 the CP does not perform a TC flush when queues are unmapped.
To avoid TC eviction from accessing an invalid VMID, flush it
explicitly before releasing a VMID.

v2: Fix unnecessary list_for_each_entry_safe
v3: Moved allocation to kfd_process_device_init_vm
