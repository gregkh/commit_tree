perf inject: Emit instruction records on ETM trace discontinuity

There may be discontinuities in the ETM trace stream due to overflows or
ETM configuration for selective trace.  This patch emits an instruction
sample with the pending branch stack when a TRACE ON packet occurs
indicating a discontinuity in the trace data.

A new packet type CS_ETM_TRACE_ON is added, which is emitted by the low
level decoder when a TRACE ON occurs.  The higher level decoder flushes
the branch stack when this packet is emitted.
