scsi: core: host template attribute groups

The patch introduces an additional field in the scsi_host_template
structure - struct attribute_group **sdev_group.  This field allows to
define groups of attributes. It will provide an ability to use binary
attributes as well as device attributes and to group them under
subfolders if necessary.
