drm/msm/dsi: check for failure on retrieving pll in dsi manager

Make msm_dsi_pll_init consistently return an error code instead
of NULL when pll initialization fails so that later pll
retrieval can check against an error code. Add checks for these
failures after retrieval of src_pll to avoid invalid pointer
dereferences later in msm_dsi_pll_get_clk_provider.
