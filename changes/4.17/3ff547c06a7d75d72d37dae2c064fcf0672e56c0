sctp: add support for SCTP AUTH Information for sendmsg

This patch is to add support for SCTP AUTH Information for sendmsg,
as described in section 5.3.8 of RFC6458.

With this option, you can provide shared key identifier used for
sending the user message.

It's also a necessary send info for sctp_sendv.

Note that it reuses sinfo->sinfo_tsn to indicate if this option is
set and sinfo->sinfo_ssn to save the shkey ID which can be 0.
