drm/i915: Convert intel_hpd_irq_event() into an encoder hotplug hook

Allow encoders to customize their hotplug processing by moving the
intel_hpd_irq_event() code into an encoder hotplug vfunc. Currently
only SDVO needs this to re-enable hotplug signalling in the SDVO
chip. We'll use this same hook for DP/HDMI link management later.
