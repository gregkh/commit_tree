inet: frags: get rif of inet_frag_evicting()

This refactors ip_expire() since one indentation level is removed.

Note: in the future, we should try hard to avoid the skb_clone()
since this is a serious performance cost.
Under DDOS, the ICMP message wont be sent because of rate limits.

Fact that ip6_expire_frag_queue() does not use skb_clone() is
disturbing too. Presumably IPv6 should have the same
issue than the one we fixed in commit ec4fbd64751d
("inet: frag: release spinlock before calling icmp_send()")
