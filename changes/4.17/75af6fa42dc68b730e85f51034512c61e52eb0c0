clk: sunxi-ng: remove select on obsolete SUNXI_CCU_X kconfig name

The following symbols:
SUNXI_CCU_DIV
SUNXI_CCU_MULT
SUNXI_CCU_NK
SUNXI_CCU_NKM
SUNXI_CCU_NM
SUNXI_CCU_MP
SUNXI_CCU_PHASE
were removed with the commit 06e226c7fb23 ("clk: sunxi-ng: Move all clock types to a library")
So selecting them is useless.

Fixes: c84f5683f6e9 ("clk: sunxi-ng: Add sun4i/sun7i CCU driver")
