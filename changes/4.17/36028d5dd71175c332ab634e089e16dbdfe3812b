fs: add ksys_p{read,write}64() helpers; remove in-kernel calls to syscalls

Using the ksys_p{read,write}64() wrappers allows us to get rid of
in-kernel calls to the sys_pread64() and sys_pwrite64() syscalls.
The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is meant as a drop-in
replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the same calling
convention as sys_p{read,write}64().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
