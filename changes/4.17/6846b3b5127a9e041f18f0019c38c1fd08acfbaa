PCI: Report quirks that take more than 10ms

With "initcall_debug", we report how long every PCI quirk took.

Even without "initcall_debug", report the runtime of any quirk that takes
longer than 10ms.  This is to make it easier to notice quirks that slow
down boot.

This was motivated by a report from Paul Menzel that PCI final quirks took
half a second at boot.
