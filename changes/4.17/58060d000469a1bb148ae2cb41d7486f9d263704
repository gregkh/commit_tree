staging: ks7010: Replace local frame type constants with kernel constants.

This driver defined constants FRAME_TYPE_* to represent frame control
field codes; however, these constants are already defined in the header
'linux/ieee80211.h' as  IEEE80211_STYPE_*.  This change removes the locally
defined constants and substitutes the kernel's constants.
