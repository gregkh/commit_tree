mm/page_alloc: don't reserve ZONE_HIGHMEM for ZONE_MOVABLE request

Freepage on ZONE_HIGHMEM doesn't work for kernel memory so it's not that
important to reserve.  When ZONE_MOVABLE is used, this problem would
theorectically cause to decrease usable memory for GFP_HIGHUSER_MOVABLE
allocation request which is mainly used for page cache and anon page
allocation.  So, fix it by setting 0 to
sysctl_lowmem_reserve_ratio[ZONE_HIGHMEM].

And, defining sysctl_lowmem_reserve_ratio array by MAX_NR_ZONES - 1 size
makes code complex.  For example, if there is highmem system, following
reserve ratio is activated for *NORMAL ZONE* which would be easyily
misleading people.

 #ifdef CONFIG_HIGHMEM
 32
 #endif

This patch also fixes this situation by defining
sysctl_lowmem_reserve_ratio array by MAX_NR_ZONES and place "#ifdef" to
right place.
