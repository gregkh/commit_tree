libnvdimm, label: change nvdimm_num_label_slots per UEFI 2.7

sizeof_namespace_index() fails when NVDIMM devices have the minimum
1024 bytes label storage area.  nvdimm_num_label_slots() returns 3
slots while the area is only big enough for 2 slots.

Change nvdimm_num_label_slots() to calculate a number of label slots
according to UEFI 2.7 spec.
