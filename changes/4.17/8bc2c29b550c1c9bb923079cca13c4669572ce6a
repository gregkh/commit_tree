ARM: mxs_defconfig: Re-sync defconfig

Re-sync the defconfig by doing:

make savedefconfig
cp defconfig arch/arm/configs/mxs_defconfig

So keep it in sync to help further changes in defconfig.

The explanation for removing the Kconfig symbols:

CONFIG_FHANDLE=y: verified that it is still selected
selected
CONFIG_DEVPTS_MULTIPLE_INSTANCES=y: does not exist anymore
CONFIG_NVMEM=y: verified that it is still selected
CONFIG_LOCKUP_DETECTOR=y: need to select CONFIG_SOFTLOCKUP_DETECTOR now
CONFIG_TIMER_STATS=y: does not exist anymore

Boot tested on a imx28evk.
