drm/amdkfd: Remove limit on number of GPUs

Currently the number of GPUs is limited by aperture placement options
available on GFX7 and GFX8 hardware. This limitation is not necessary.
Scratch and LDS represent per-work-item and per-work-group storage
respectively. Different work-items and work-groups use the same virtual
address to access their own data. Work running on different GPUs is by
definition in different work-groups (different dispatches, in fact).
That means the same virtual addresses can be used for these apertures
on different GPUs.

Add a new AMDKFD_IOC_GET_PROCESS_APERTURES_NEW ioctl that removes the
artificial limitation on the number of GPUs that can be supported. The
new ioctl allows user mode to query the number of GPUs to allocate
enough memory for all GPUs to be reported.

This deprecates AMDKFD_IOC_GET_PROCESS_APERTURES.
