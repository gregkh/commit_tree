sfc: limit ARFS workitems in flight per channel

A misconfigured system (e.g. with all interrupts affinitised to all CPUs)
 may produce a storm of ARFS steering events.  With the existing sfc ARFS
 implementation, that could create a backlog of workitems that grinds the
 system to a halt.  To prevent this, limit the number of workitems that
 may be in flight for a given SFC device to 8 (EFX_RPS_MAX_IN_FLIGHT), and
 return EBUSY from our ndo_rx_flow_steer method if the limit is reached.
Given this limit, also store the workitems in an array of slots within the
 struct efx_nic, rather than dynamically allocating for each request.
The limit should not negatively impact performance, because it is only
 likely to be hit in cases where ARFS will be ineffective anyway.
