nfsd: vfs_mkdir() might succeed leaving dentry negative unhashed

That can (and does, on some filesystems) happen - ->mkdir() (and thus
vfs_mkdir()) can legitimately leave its argument negative and just
unhash it, counting upon the lookup to pick the object we'd created
next time we try to look at that name.

Some vfs_mkdir() callers forget about that possibility...
