s390: correct nospec auto detection init order

With CONFIG_EXPOLINE_AUTO=y the call of spectre_v2_auto_early() via
early_initcall is done *after* the early_param functions. This
overwrites any settings done with the nobp/no_spectre_v2/spectre_v2
parameters. The code patching for the kernel is done after the
evaluation of the early parameters but before the early_initcall
is done. The end result is a kernel image that is patched correctly
but the kernel modules are not.

Make sure that the nospec auto detection function is called before the
early parameters are evaluated and before the code patching is done.
