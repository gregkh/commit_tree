tracepoint: Do not warn on ENOMEM

Tracepoint should only warn when a kernel API user does not respect the
required preconditions (e.g. same tracepoint enabled twice, or called
to remove a tracepoint that does not exist).

Silence warning in out-of-memory conditions, given that the error is
returned to the caller.

This ensures that out-of-memory error-injection testing does not trigger
warnings in tracepoint.c, which were seen by syzbot.
