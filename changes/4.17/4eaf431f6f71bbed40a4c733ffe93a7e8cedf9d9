memcg: fix per_node_info cleanup

syzbot has triggered a NULL ptr dereference when allocation fault
injection enforces a failure and alloc_mem_cgroup_per_node_info
initializes memcg->nodeinfo only half way through.

But __mem_cgroup_free still tries to free all per-node data and
dereferences pn->lruvec_stat_cpu unconditioanlly even if the specific
per-node data hasn't been initialized.

The bug is quite unlikely to hit because small allocations do not fail
and we would need quite some numa nodes to make struct
mem_cgroup_per_node large enough to cross the costly order.
