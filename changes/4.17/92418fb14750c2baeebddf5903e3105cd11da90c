i40e/i40evf: Use usec value instead of reg value for ITR defines

Instead of using the register value for the defines when setting up the
ring ITR we can just use the actual values and avoid the use of shifts and
macros to translate between the values we have and the values we want.

This helps to make the code more readable as we can quickly translate from
one value to the other.
