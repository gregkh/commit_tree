tracing: Add timestamp_mode trace file

Add a new option flag indicating whether or not the ring buffer is in
'absolute timestamp' mode.

Currently this is only set/unset by hist triggers that make use of a
common_timestamp.  As such, there's no reason to make this writeable
for users - its purpose is only to allow users to determine
unequivocally whether or not the ring buffer is in that mode (although
absolute timestamps can coexist with the normal delta timestamps, when
the ring buffer is in absolute mode, timestamps written while absolute
mode is in effect take up more space in the buffer, and are not as
efficient).
