drm/vc4: Fix oops dereferencing DPI's connector since panel_bridge.

In the cleanup, I didn't notice that we needed to dereference the
connector for the bus_format.  Fix the regression by looking up the
first (and only) connector attached to us, and assume that its
bus_format is what we want.  Some day it would be good to have that
part of display_info attached to the bridge, instead.
