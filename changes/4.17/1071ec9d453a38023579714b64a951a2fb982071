sctp: do not check port in sctp_inet6_cmp_addr

pf->cmp_addr() is called before binding a v6 address to the sock. It
should not check ports, like in sctp_inet_cmp_addr.

But sctp_inet6_cmp_addr checks the addr by invoking af(6)->cmp_addr,
sctp_v6_cmp_addr where it also compares the ports.

This would cause that setsockopt(SCTP_SOCKOPT_BINDX_ADD) could bind
multiple duplicated IPv6 addresses after Commit 40b4f0fd74e4 ("sctp:
lack the check for ports in sctp_v6_cmp_addr").

This patch is to remove af->cmp_addr called in sctp_inet6_cmp_addr,
but do the proper check for both v6 addrs and v4mapped addrs.

v1->v2:
  - define __sctp_v6_cmp_addr to do the common address comparison
    used for both pf and af v6 cmp_addr.
