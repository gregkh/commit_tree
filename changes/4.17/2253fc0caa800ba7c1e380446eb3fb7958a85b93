RDMA/CMA: Add rdma_port_space to UAPI

Since the rdma_port_space enum is being passed between user and kernel for
user cm_id setup, we need it in a UAPI header.  So add it to
rdma_user_cm.h.

This also fixes the cm_id restrack changes which pass up the port space
value via the RDMA_NLDEV_ATTR_RES_PS attribute.
