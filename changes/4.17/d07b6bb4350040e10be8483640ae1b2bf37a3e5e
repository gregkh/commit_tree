net: hns3: add existence checking before adding unicast mac address

It's not allowed to add two same unicast mac address entries to the
mac_vlan table. When modify the uc mac address of a VF device to the
same value with the PF device's, the PF device will lose its entry of
the mac_vlan table.

Lookup the mac address in the mac_vlan table, and add it if the entry
is inexistent.
