fs: add ksys_chroot() helper; remove-in kernel calls to sys_chroot()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the
sys_chroot() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is
meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the
same calling convention as sys_chroot().

In the near future, the fs-external callers of ksys_chroot() should be
converted to use kern_path()/set_fs_root() directly. Then ksys_chroot()
can be moved within sys_chroot() again.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
