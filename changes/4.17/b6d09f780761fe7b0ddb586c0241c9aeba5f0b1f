pinctrl: nomadik: Drop U8540/9540 support

The U8540 was an evolved version of the U8500, but it was never
mass produced or put into products, only reference designs exist.
The upstream support was never completed and it is unlikely that
this will happen so drop the support for now to simplify
maintenance of the U8500.
