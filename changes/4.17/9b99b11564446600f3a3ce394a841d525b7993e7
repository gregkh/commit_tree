btrfs: rename btrfs_close_extra_device to btrfs_free_extra_devids

This function btrfs_close_extra_devices() is about freeing
extra devids which once it may have belonged to this filesystem.
So rename it and add the comment. The _devid suffix is
appropriate as this function won't handle devices which are
outside of the filesytem being mounted.
