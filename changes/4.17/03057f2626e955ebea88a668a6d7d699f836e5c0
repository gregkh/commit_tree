perf/arm-cci: Simplify CPU hotplug

Realistically, systems with multiple CCIs are unlikely to ever exist,
and since the driver only actually supports a single instance anyway
there's really no need to do the multi-instance hotplug state dance.

Take the opportunity to simplify the hotplug-related code all over,
addressing the context-migration TODO in the process for good measure.
