selftests/bpf: Selftest for sys_bind hooks

Add selftest to work with bpf_sock_addr context from
`BPF_PROG_TYPE_CGROUP_SOCK_ADDR` programs.

Try to bind(2) on IP:port and apply:
* loads to make sure context can be read correctly, including narrow
  loads (byte, half) for IP and full-size loads (word) for all fields;
* stores to those fields allowed by verifier.

All combination from IPv4/IPv6 and TCP/UDP are tested.

Both scenarios are tested:
* valid programs can be loaded and attached;
* invalid programs can be neither loaded nor attached.

Test passes when expected data can be read from context in the
BPF-program, and after the call to bind(2) socket is bound to IP:port
pair that was written by BPF-program to the context.

Example:
  # ./test_sock_addr
  Attached bind4 program.
  Test case #1 (IPv4/TCP):
          Requested: bind(192.168.1.254, 4040) ..
             Actual: bind(127.0.0.1, 4444)
  Test case #2 (IPv4/UDP):
          Requested: bind(192.168.1.254, 4040) ..
             Actual: bind(127.0.0.1, 4444)
  Attached bind6 program.
  Test case #3 (IPv6/TCP):
          Requested: bind(face:b00c:1234:5678::abcd, 6060) ..
             Actual: bind(::1, 6666)
  Test case #4 (IPv6/UDP):
          Requested: bind(face:b00c:1234:5678::abcd, 6060) ..
             Actual: bind(::1, 6666)
