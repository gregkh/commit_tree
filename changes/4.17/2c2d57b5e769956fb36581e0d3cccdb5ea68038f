mm: Clear arch specific VM flags on protection change

When protection bits are changed on a VMA, some of the architecture
specific flags should be cleared as well. An examples of this are the
PKEY flags on x86. This patch expands the current code that clears
PKEY flags for x86, to support similar functionality for other
architectures as well.
