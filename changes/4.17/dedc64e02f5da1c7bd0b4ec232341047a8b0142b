serial: imx: Stop to receive in .stop_rx()

When the UART is used in DMA mode, .stop_rx() does nothing if the port
isn't suspended. This is wrong as .stop_rx() should stop receiving
characters unconditionally. When the port is about to be closed the DMA
channel is stopped in .shutdown(), so this isn't necessary to be in
.stop_rx() here, too.
