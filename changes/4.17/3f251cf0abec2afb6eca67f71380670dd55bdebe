Revert "arm64: Revert L1_CACHE_SHIFT back to 6 (64-byte cache line size)"

This reverts commit 1f85b42a691cd8329ba82dbcaeec80ac1231b32a.

The internal dma-direct.h API has changed in -next, which collides with
us trying to use it to manage non-coherent DMA devices on systems with
unreasonably large cache writeback granules.

This isn't at all trivial to resolve, so revert our changes for now and
we can revisit this after the merge window. Effectively, this just
restores our behaviour back to that of 4.16.
