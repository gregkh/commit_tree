Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Add ACPI HIDs found in Windows .inf files and DSTDs

Now that we need just an ACPI HID in the table, and the driver auto-
configures itself otherwise, we can easily add a bunch of known ACPI HIDs.

This avoids having to add these 1 by 1 as devices with one are encountered
by users.

This commit may seem as if it simply adds all IDs between BCM2E00-BCM2EAC,
but that is not true, all these IDs were found in actual .inf files and
the range is not entirely continuous, the following IDs are not added:
BCM2E6A, BCM2E6C, BCM2E8F and BCM2E91 because I did not see these in any
.inf files. As for the large amount of IDs this seems to be caused by
Broadcom using a separate ID for every bluetooth module using their
chips. E.g. BCM2EA6 seems to be specifically for the Raspberry Pi 3.
