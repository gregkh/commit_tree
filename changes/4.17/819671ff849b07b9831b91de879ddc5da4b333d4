syscalls: define and explain goal to not call syscalls in the kernel

The syscall entry points to the kernel defined by SYSCALL_DEFINEx()
and COMPAT_SYSCALL_DEFINEx() should only be called from userspace
through kernel entry points, but not from the kernel itself. This
will allow cleanups and optimizations to the entry paths *and* to
the parts of the kernel code which currently need to pretend to be
userspace in order to make use of syscalls.
