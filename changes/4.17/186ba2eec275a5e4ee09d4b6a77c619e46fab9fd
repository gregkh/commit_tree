regmap: Use _regmap_read in regmap_bulk_read

Bulk reads may potentially read a lot of registers and regmap_read will
take and release the regmap lock for each register. Avoid bouncing
the lock so frequently by holding the lock locally and calling
_regmap_read instead. This also has the nice side-effect that all the
reads will be done atomically so no other threads can sneak a write in
during the regmap_bulk_read.
