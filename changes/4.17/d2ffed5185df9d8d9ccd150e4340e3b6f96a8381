ARM: amba: Don't read past the end of sysfs "driver_override" buffer

When printing the driver_override parameter when it is 4095 and 4094
bytes long, the printing code would access invalid memory because we
need count + 1 bytes for printing.

Cfr. commits 4efe874aace57dba ("PCI: Don't read past the end of sysfs
"driver_override" buffer") and bf563b01c2895a4b ("driver core: platform:
Don't read past the end of "driver_override" buffer").

Fixes: 3cf385713460eb2b ("ARM: 8256/1: driver coamba: add device binding path 'driver_override'")
