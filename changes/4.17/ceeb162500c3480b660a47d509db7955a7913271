usb: typec: Separate the definitions for data and power roles

USB Type-C specification v1.2 separated the power and data
roles more clearly. Dual-Role-Data term was introduced, and
the meaning of DRP was changed from "Dual-Role-Port" to
"Dual-Role-Power".

In order to allow the port drivers to describe the
capabilities of the ports more clearly according to the
newest specifications, introducing separate definitions for
the data roles.
