arm64: capabilities: Update prototype for enable call back

We issue the enable() call back for all CPU hwcaps capabilities
available on the system, on all the CPUs. So far we have ignored
the argument passed to the call back, which had a prototype to
accept a "void *" for use with on_each_cpu() and later with
stop_machine(). However, with commit 0a0d111d40fd1
("arm64: cpufeature: Pass capability structure to ->enable callback"),
there are some users of the argument who wants the matching capability
struct pointer where there are multiple matching criteria for a single
capability. Clean up the declaration of the call back to make it clear.

 1) Renamed to cpu_enable(), to imply taking necessary actions on the
    called CPU for the entry.
 2) Pass const pointer to the capability, to allow the call back to
    check the entry. (e.,g to check if any action is needed on the CPU)
 3) We don't care about the result of the call back, turning this to
    a void.
