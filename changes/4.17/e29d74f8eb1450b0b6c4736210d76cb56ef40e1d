scsi: lpfc: Fix mailbox wait for POST_SGL mbox command

POST_SGL_PAGES mailbox command failed with status (timeout).

wait_event_interruptible_timeout when called from mailbox wait interface,
gets interrupted, and will randomly fail. Behavior seems very specific to 1
particular server type.

Fix by changing from wait_event_interruptible_timeout to
wait_for_completion_timeout.
