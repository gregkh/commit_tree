virtio_net: split out ctrl buffer

When sending control commands, virtio net sets up several buffers for
DMA. The buffers are all part of the net device which means it's
actually allocated by kvmalloc so it's in theory (on extreme memory
pressure) possible to get a vmalloc'ed buffer which on some platforms
means we can't DMA there.

Fix up by moving the DMA buffers into a separate structure.
