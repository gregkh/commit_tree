s390/qdio: don't release memory in qdio_setup_irq()

Calling qdio_release_memory() on error is just plain wrong. It frees
the main qdio_irq struct, when following code still uses it.

Also, no other error path in qdio_establish() does this. So trust
callers to clean up via qdio_free() if some step of the QDIO
initialization fails.
