tipc: some name changes

We rename some lists and fields in struct publication both to make
the naming more consistent and to better reflect their roles. We
also update the descriptions of those lists.

node_list -> local_publ
cluster_list -> all_publ
pport_list -> binding_sock
ref -> port

There are no functional changes in this commit.
