HISI LPC: Support the LPC host on Hip06/Hip07 with DT bindings

The low-pin-count (LPC) interface of Hip06/Hip07 accesses I/O port space of
peripherals.

Implement the LPC host controller driver which performs the I/O operations
on the underlying hardware.  We don't want to touch existing drivers such
as ipmi-bt, so this driver applies the indirect-IO introduced in the
previous patch after registering an indirect-IO node to the indirect-IO
devices list which will be searched by the I/O accessors to retrieve the
host-local I/O port.

The driver config is set as a bool instead of a tristate.  The reason here
is that, by the very nature of the driver providing a logical PIO range, it
does not make sense to have this driver as a loadable module.  Another more
specific reason is that the Huawei D03 board which includes Hip06 SoC
requires the LPC bus for UART console, so should be built in.
