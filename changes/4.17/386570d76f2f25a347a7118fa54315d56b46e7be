leds: add driver for support Mellanox regmap LEDs for BMC and x86 platform

Driver obtains LED devices according to system configuration and creates
devices in form: "devicename:color:function", like
The full path is to be:
/sys/class/leds/mlxreg\:status\:amber/brightness
After timer trigger activation:
echo timer > /sys/class/leds/mlxreg\:status\:amber/trigger
Attributes for LED blinking will appaer in sysfs infrastructure:
/sys/class/leds/mlxreg\:status\:amber/delay_off
/sys/class/leds/mlxreg\:status\:amber/delay_on

LED setting is controlled through the on-board programmable devices,
which exports its register map. This device could be attached to any
bus type, for which register mapping is supported.
