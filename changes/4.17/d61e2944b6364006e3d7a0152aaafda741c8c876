genirq: Add wakeup sysfs node to show IRQ wakeup state

Surprisingly there is no simple way to see if the IRQ line in question
is wakeup source or not.

Note that wakeup might be an OOB (out-of-band) source like GPIO line
which makes things slightly more complicated.

Add a sysfs node to cover this case.
