ibmvnic: Do not attempt to login if RX or TX queues are not allocated

If a device reset fails for some reason, TX and RX queue resources
could be released. If a user attempts to open the device in this scenario,
it may result in a kernel panic as the driver tries to access this
memory. To fix this, include a check before device login that TX/RX
queues are still there before enabling the device. In addition, return a
value that can be checked in case of any errors to avoid waiting for a
completion that will never come.
