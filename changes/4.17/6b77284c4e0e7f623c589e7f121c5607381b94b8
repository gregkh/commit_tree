ARM: imx_v6_v7_defconfig: Re-sync defconfig

Re-sync the defconfig by doing:

make savedefconfig
cp defconfig arch/arm/configs/imx_v6_v7_defconfig

Checked that all the removed options are still enabled by Kconfig logic.

The exception is CONFIG_SOC_CAMERA_OV2640, which is only used by some
mx31 machines. As the mx3_camera driver has been removed from the kernel
tree, removing CONFIG_SOC_CAMERA_OV2640 is not an issue.

So keep it in sync to help further changes in defconfig.
