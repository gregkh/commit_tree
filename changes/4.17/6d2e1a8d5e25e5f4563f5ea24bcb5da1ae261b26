net: ena: Eliminate duplicate barriers on weakly-ordered archs

Code includes barrier() followed by writel(). writel() already has a
barrier on some architectures like arm64.

This ends up CPU observing two barriers back to back before executing the
register write.

Create a new wrapper function with relaxed write operator. Use the new
wrapper when a write is following a barrier().

Since code already has an explicit barrier call, changing writel() to
writel_relaxed() and adding mmiowb() for ordering protection.
