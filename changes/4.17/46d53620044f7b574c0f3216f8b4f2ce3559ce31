perf cs-etm: Support unknown_thread in cs_etm_auxtrace

CoreSight doesn't allocate thread structure for unknown_thread in ETM
auxtrace, so unknown_thread is NULL pointer.  If the perf data doesn't
contain valid tid and then cs_etm__mem_access() uses unknown_thread
instead as thread handler, this results in a segmentation fault when
thread__find_addr_map() accesses the thread handler.

This commit creates a new thread data which is used by unknown_thread, so
CoreSight tracing can roll back to use unknown_thread if perf data
doesn't include valid thread info.  This commit also releases thread
data for initialization failure case and for normal auxtrace free flow.
