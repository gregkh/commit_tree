x86/mce/AMD, EDAC/mce_amd: Enumerate Reserved SMCA bank type

Currently, bank 4 is reserved on Fam17h, so we chose not to initialize
bank 4 in the smca_banks array. This means that when we check if a bank
is initialized, like during boot or resume, we will see that bank 4 is
not initialized and try to initialize it.

This will cause a call trace, when resuming from suspend, due to
rdmsr_*on_cpu() calls in the init path. The rdmsr_*on_cpu() calls issue
an IPI but we're running with interrupts disabled. This triggers:

  WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 11523 at kernel/smp.c:291 smp_call_function_single+0xdc/0xe0
  ...

Reserved banks will be read-as-zero, so their MCA_IPID register will be
zero. So, like the smca_banks array, the threshold_banks array will not
have an entry for a reserved bank since all its MCA_MISC* registers will
be zero.

Enumerate a "Reserved" bank type that matches on a HWID_MCATYPE of 0,0.

Use the "Reserved" type when checking if a bank is reserved. It's
possible that other bank numbers may be reserved on future systems.

Don't try to find the block address on reserved banks.
