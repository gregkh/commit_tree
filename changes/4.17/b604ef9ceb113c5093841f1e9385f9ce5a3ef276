ARM: tegra: Use proper IRQ type definitions

This switches a few interrupt definitions that were using either
GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH or GPIO_ACTIVE_LOW as IRQ type, which is invalid.

This is mostly a cosmetic change, that doesn't affect any driver.

Analogous to Paul's commit 38333641b6dd ("ARM: tegra: nyan: Use proper
IRQ type definitions").
