net: llc: drop VLA in llc_sap_mcast()

Avoid a VLA[1] by using a real constant expression instead of a variable.
The compiler should be able to optimize the original code and avoid using
an actual VLA. Anyway this change is useful because it will avoid a false
positive with -Wvla, it might also help the compiler generating better
code.
