powerpc/64s/idle: Consolidate power9_offline_stop()/power9_idle_stop()

Commit 3d4fbffdd703 ("powerpc/64s/idle: POWER9 implement a separate
idle stop function for hotplug") that added power9_offline_stop() was
written before commit 7672691a08c8 ("powerpc/powernv: Provide a way to
force a core into SMT4 mode").

When merging the former I failed to notice that it caused us to skip
the force-SMT4 logic for offline CPUs. The result is that offlined
CPUs will not correctly participate in the force-SMT4 logic, which
presumably will result in badness (not tested).

Reconcile the two commits by making power9_offline_stop() a pre-cursor
to power9_idle_stop(), so that they share the force-SMT4 logic.

This is based on an original commit from Nick, all breakage is my own.
