drm/vmwgfx: Get rid of the device-private suspended member

It was used to early block fbdev dirty processing. Replace it with an
unprotected check of the par->dirty.active field. While this might
race with the vmw_fb_off() function, we do a protected check later so
the race will at worst lead to grabbing and releasing a couple of locks.
