ipc: add shmget syscall wrapper

Provide ksys_shmget() wrapper to avoid in-kernel calls to this syscall.
The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is meant as a drop-in
replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the same calling
convention as sys_shmget().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
