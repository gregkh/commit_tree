net: Remove net_rwsem from {, un}register_netdevice_notifier()

These functions take net_rwsem, while wireless_nlevent_flush()
also takes it. But down_read() can't be taken recursive,
because of rw_semaphore design, which prevents it to be occupied
by only readers forever.

Since we take pernet_ops_rwsem in {,un}register_netdevice_notifier(),
net list can't change, so these down_read()/up_read() can be removed.
