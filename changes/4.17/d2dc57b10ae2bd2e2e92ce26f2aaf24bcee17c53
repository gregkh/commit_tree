media: v4l: Bring back array_size parameter to v4l2_find_nearest_size

An older version of the driver patches were merged accidentally which
resulted in missing the array_size parameter that tells the length of the
array that contains the different supported sizes.

Bring it back to v4l2_find_nearest size and make the corresponding change
for the drivers using it as well.
