lib: Add strongly typed 64bit int_sqrt

There is no option to perform 64bit integer sqrt on 32bit platform.
Added stronger typed int_sqrt64 enables the 64bit calculations to
be performed on 32bit platforms. Using same algorithm as int_sqrt()
with strong typing provides enough precision also on 32bit platforms,
but it sacrifices some performance. In case values are smaller than
ULONG_MAX the standard int_sqrt is used for calculation to maximize the
performance due to more native calculations.
