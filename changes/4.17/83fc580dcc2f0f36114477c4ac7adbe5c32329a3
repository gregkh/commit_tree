Input: gpio-keys - add support for wakeup event action

Add support for specifying event actions to trigger wakeup when using
the gpio-keys input device as a wakeup source.

This would allow the device to configure when to wakeup the system. For
example a gpio-keys input device for pen insert, may only want to wakeup
the system when ejecting the pen.
