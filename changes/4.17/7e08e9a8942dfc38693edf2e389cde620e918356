staging: lustre: llite: simplify ll_find_alias()

Now that ll_find_alias is only searching for one type
of dentry, we can return as soon as we find it.
This allows substantial simplification, and brings the
bonus that we don't need to take the d_lock again just
to increment the ref-count.  We can increment it immediately
that the dentry is found.
