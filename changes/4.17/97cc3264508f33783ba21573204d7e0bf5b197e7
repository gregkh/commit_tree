svcrdma: Consult max_qp_init_rd_atom when accepting connections

The target needs to return the lesser of the client's Inbound RDMA
Read Queue Depth (IRD), provided in the connection parameters, and
the local device's Outbound RDMA Read Queue Depth (ORD). The latter
limit is max_qp_init_rd_atom, not max_qp_rd_atom.

The svcrdma_ord value caps the ORD value for iWARP transports, which
do not exchange ORD/IRD values at connection time. Since no other
Linux kernel RDMA-enabled storage target sees fit to provide this
cap, I'm removing it here too.

initiator_depth is a u8, so ensure the computed ORD value does not
overflow that field.
