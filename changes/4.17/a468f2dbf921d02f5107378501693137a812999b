kvm: apic: Flush TLB after APIC mode/address change if VPIDs are in use

Currently, KVM flushes the TLB after a change to the APIC access page
address or the APIC mode when EPT mode is enabled. However, even in
shadow paging mode, a TLB flush is needed if VPIDs are being used, as
specified in the Intel SDM Section 29.4.5.

So replace vmx_flush_tlb_ept_only() with vmx_flush_tlb(), which will
flush if either EPT or VPIDs are in use.
