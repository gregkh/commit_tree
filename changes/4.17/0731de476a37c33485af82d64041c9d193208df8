nfit: skip region registration for incomplete control regions

Per the ACPI specification the only functional purpose for a DIMM
Control Region to be mapped into the system physical address space, from
an OSPM perspective, is to support block-apertures. However, there are
some BIOSen that publish DIMM Control Region SPA entries for pre-boot
environment consumption.  Undo the kernel policy of generating disabled
'ndblk' regions when this configuration is detected.
