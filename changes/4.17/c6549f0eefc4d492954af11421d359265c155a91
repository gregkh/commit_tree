phy: qcom-qmp: Fix PHY block reset sequence

PHY block or asynchronous reset requires signal
to be asserted before de-asserting. Driver is only
de-asserting signal which is already low, hence
reset operation is a no-op. Fix this by asserting
signal first. Also, resetting requires PHY clocks
to be turned ON only after reset is finished. Fix
that as well.
