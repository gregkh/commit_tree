ixgbe: add status reg reads to ixgbe_check_remove

Add status register reads and delay between reads to ixgbe_check_remove.
Registers can read 0xFFFFFFFF during PCI reset, which causes the driver
to remove the adapter. The additional status register reads can reduce the
chance of this race condition.

If the status register is not 0xFFFFFFFF, then ixgbe_check_remove returns
the value of the register being read.
