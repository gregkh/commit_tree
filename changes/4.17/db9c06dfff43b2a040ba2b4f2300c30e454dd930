drm/i915: Fix Limited Range Color Handling

Some panels support limited range output (16-235) compared
to full range RGB values (0-255). Also userspace can control
the RGB range using "Broadcast RGB" property. Currently the
code to handle full range to limited range is broken. This
patch fixes the same by properly scaling down all the full
range co-efficients with limited range scaling factor.

v2: Fixed Ville's review comments.

v3: Changed input to const and used correct data types as
    suggested by Ville

v4: Fixed some missing data type corrections.
