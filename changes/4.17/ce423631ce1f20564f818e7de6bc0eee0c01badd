audit: track the owner of the command mutex ourselves

Evidently the __mutex_owner() function was never intended for use
outside the core mutex code, so build a thing locking wrapper around
the mutex code which allows us to track the mutex owner.

One, arguably positive, side effect is that this allows us to hide
the audit_cmd_mutex inside of kernel/audit.c behind the lock/unlock
functions.
