net: socket: replace call to sys_recv() with __sys_recvfrom()

sys_recv() merely expands the parameters to __sys_recvfrom() by NULL and
NULL. Open-code this in the two places which used sys_recv() as a wrapper
to __sys_recvfrom().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
