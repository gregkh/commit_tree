net/wireless: fix spaces and grammar copy/paste in vendor Kconfig help text

Lots of the wireless driver vendor Kconfig symol help text says
"questions about  cards." (2 spaces between "about" and "cards")

Besides dropping one of those spaces, it also needs some other word
inserted there. Instead of putting each vendor's name there, I chose
to say "these" cards in all of the Kconfig help text.
