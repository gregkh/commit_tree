cpufreq: Reorder cpufreq_online() error code path

Ideally the de-allocation of resources should happen in the exact
opposite order in which they were allocated. It helps maintain the code
in long term, even if nothing really breaks with incorrect ordering.

That wasn't followed in cpufreq_online() and it has some
inconsistencies.  For example, the symlinks were created from within
the locked region while they are removed only after putting the locks.
Also ->exit() should have been called only after the symlinks are
removed and the lock is dropped, as that was the case when ->init()
was first called.
