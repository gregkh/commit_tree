staging: lustre: llite: refine ll_find_alias based on d_exact_alias

The task of ll_find_alias() is now very similar to d_exact_alias().
We cannot use that function directly, but we can copy much of
the structure so that the similarities and differences are more
obvious.
Examining d_exact_alias() shows that the d_lock spinlock does not
need to be held in ll_find_alias as much as it currently is.
