afs: Fix address list parsing

The parsing of port specifiers in the address list obtained from the DNS
resolution upcall doesn't work as in4_pton() and in6_pton() will fail on
encountering an unexpected delimiter (in this case, the '+' marking the
port number).  However, in*_pton() can't be given multiple specifiers.

Fix this by finding the delimiter in advance and not relying on in*_pton()
to find the end of the address for us.
