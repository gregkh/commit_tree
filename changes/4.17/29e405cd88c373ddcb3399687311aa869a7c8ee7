RISC-V: Support ALIGN relocation type in kernel module

Just fail on align type. Kernel modules loader didn't do relax
like linker, it is difficult to remove or migrate the code,
but the remnant nop instructions harm the performaace of module.
We expect the building module with the no-relax option.
