dmaengine: stm32-dma: fix max items per transfer

Having 0 in item counter register is valid and stands for a "No or Ended
transfer". Therefore valid transfer starts from @+0 to @+0xFFFE leading to
unaligned scatter gather at boundary. Thus it's safer to round down this
value on its FIFO size (16 Bytes).
