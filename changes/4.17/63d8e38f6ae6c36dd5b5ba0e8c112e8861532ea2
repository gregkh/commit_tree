perf intel-pt: Fix sync_switch

sync_switch is a facility to synchronize decoding more closely with the
point in the kernel when the context actually switched.

The flag when sync_switch is enabled was global to the decoding, whereas
it is really specific to the CPU.

The trace data for different CPUs is put on different queues, so add
sync_switch to the intel_pt_queue structure and use that in preference
to the global setting in the intel_pt structure.

That fixes problems decoding one CPU's trace because sync_switch was
disabled on a different CPU's queue.
