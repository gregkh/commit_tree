mm/hmm: do not differentiate between empty entry or missing directory

There is no point in differentiating between a range for which there is
not even a directory (and thus entries) and empty entry (pte_none() or
pmd_none() returns true).

Simply drop the distinction ie remove HMM_PFN_EMPTY flag and merge now
duplicate hmm_vma_walk_hole() and hmm_vma_walk_clear() functions.
