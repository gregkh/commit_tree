btrfs: property: Set incompat flag if lzo/zstd compression is set

Incompat flag of LZO/ZSTD compression should be set at:

 1. mount time (-o compress/compress-force)
 2. when defrag is done
 3. when property is set

Currently 3. is missing and this commit adds this.

This could lead to a filesystem that uses ZSTD but is not marked as
such. If a kernel without a ZSTD support encounteres a ZSTD compressed
extent, it will handle that but this could be confusing to the user.

Typically the filesystem is mounted with the ZSTD option, but the
discrepancy can arise when a filesystem is never mounted with ZSTD and
then the property on some file is set (and some new extents are
written). A simple mount with -o compress=zstd will fix that up on an
unpatched kernel.

Same goes for LZO, but this has been around for a very long time
(2.6.37) so it's unlikely that a pre-LZO kernel would be used.
