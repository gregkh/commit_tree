block/swim: Fix IO error at end of medium

Reading to the end of a 720K disk results in an IO error instead of EOF
because the block layer thinks the disk has 2880 sectors. (Partly this
is a result of inverted logic of the ONEMEG_MEDIA bit that's now fixed.)

Initialize the density and head count in swim_add_floppy() to agree
with the device size passed to set_capacity() during drive probe.

Call set_capacity() again upon device open, after refreshing the density
and head count values.
