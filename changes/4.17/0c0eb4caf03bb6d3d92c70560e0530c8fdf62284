dmaengine: avoid map_cnt overflow with CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE_RAID

When CONFIG_DMA_ENGINE_RAID is enabled, unmap pool size can reach to
256. But in struct dmaengine_unmap_data, map_cnt is only u8, wrapping
to 0, if the unmap pool is maximally used. This triggers BUG() when
struct dmaengine_unmap_data is freed. Use u16 to fix the problem.
