ASoC: uniphier: add support for UniPhier AIO DMA driver

This patch adds supports for UniPhier AIO DMA.

This module shared register area with all sound devices for
I2S, S/PDIF and so on. Since the AIO has mixed register map
for those I/Os, it is hard to split register areas for each
sound devices.
