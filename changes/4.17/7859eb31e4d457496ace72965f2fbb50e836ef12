arm64: dts: renesas: eagle: add I2C0 support

Define the Eagle board dependent part of the I2C0 device node.

The I2C0 bus is populated by ON Semiconductor PCA9653 I/O expander and
Analog Devices ADV7511W HDMI transmitter (but we're only describing the
former chip now).

Based on the original (and large) patch by Vladimir Barinov.
