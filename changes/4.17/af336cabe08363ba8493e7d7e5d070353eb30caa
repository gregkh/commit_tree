mei: limit the number of queued writes

Limit the number of queued writes per client.
Writes above this threshold are blocked till place
in the transmit queue is available.
The limit is configurable via sysfs and defaults to 50.
The implementation should provide blocking I/O behavior.
Prior to this change one would end up in the hands of OOM.
