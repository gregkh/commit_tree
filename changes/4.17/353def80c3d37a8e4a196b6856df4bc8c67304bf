mlxsw: spectrum_span: Prevent duplicate mirrors

In net commit 8175f7c4736f ("mlxsw: spectrum: Prevent duplicate
mirrors") we prevented the user from mirroring more than once from a
single binding point (port-direction pair).

The fix was essentially reverted in a merge conflict resolution when net
was merged into net-next. Restore it.
