packet: fix bitfield update race

Updates to the bitfields in struct packet_sock are not atomic.
Serialize these read-modify-write cycles.

Move po->running into a separate variable. Its writes are protected by
po->bind_lock (except for one startup case at packet_create). Also
replace a textual precondition warning with lockdep annotation.

All others are set only in packet_setsockopt. Serialize these
updates by holding the socket lock. Analogous to other field updates,
also hold the lock when testing whether a ring is active (pg_vec).
