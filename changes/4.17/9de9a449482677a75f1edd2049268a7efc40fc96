Revert "base: arch_topology: fix section mismatch build warnings"

This reverts commit 452562abb5b7 ("base: arch_topology: fix section
mismatch build warnings"). It causes the notifier call hangs in some
use-cases.

In some cases with using maxcpus, some of cpus are booted first and
then the remaining cpus are booted. As an example, some users who want
to realize fast boot up often use the following procedure.

  1) Define all CPUs on device tree (CA57x4 + CA53x4)
  2) Add "maxcpus=4" in bootargs
  3) Kernel boot up with CA57x4
  4) After kernel boot up, CA53x4 is booted from user

When kernel init was finished, CPUFREQ_POLICY_NOTIFIER was not still
unregisterd. This means that "__init init_cpu_capacity_callback()"
will be called after kernel init sequence. To avoid this problem,
it needs to remove __init{,data} annotations by reverting this commit.

Also, this commit was needed to fix kernel compile issue below.
However, this issue was also fixed by another patch: commit 82d8ba717ccb
("arch_topology: Fix section miss match warning due to
free_raw_capacity()") in v4.15 as well.
Whereas commit 452562abb5b7 added all the missing __init annotations,
commit 82d8ba717ccb removed it from free_raw_capacity().

WARNING: vmlinux.o(.text+0x548f24): Section mismatch in reference
from the function init_cpu_capacity_callback() to the variable
.init.text:$x
The function init_cpu_capacity_callback() references
the variable __init $x.
This is often because init_cpu_capacity_callback lacks a __init
annotation or the annotation of $x is wrong.
