drm/i915/bxt, glk: Avoid long atomic poll during CDCLK change

There is no requirement for doing the PCODE request polling atomically,
so do that only for a short time switching to sleeping poll afterwards.
The specification requires a 150usec timeout for the change notification,
so let's use that for the atomic poll. Do the extra 2ms poll - needed as
a workaround on BXT/GLK - in sleeping mode.

v2:
- rebase on v2 of patchset dropping the sandybridge_pcode_read/write
  refactoring (Chris)
