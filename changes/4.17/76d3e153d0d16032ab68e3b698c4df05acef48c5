net: Revert "ipv4: get rid of ip_ra_lock"

This reverts commit ba3f571d5dde. The commit was made
after 1215e51edad1 "ipv4: fix a deadlock in ip_ra_control",
and killed ip_ra_lock, which became useless after rtnl_lock()
made used to destroy every raw ipv4 socket. This scales
very bad, and next patch in series reverts 1215e51edad1.
ip_ra_lock will be used again.
