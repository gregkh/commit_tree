media: em28xx-dvb: simplify DVB module probing logic

The module probing logic there is a way more complex than
it should be, and requires some special magic to avoid
stack overflows when KASAN is enabled.

Solve it by creating ancillary functions to setup the
platform data and request module.

Now, the probing functions are cleaner and easier to understand.

As a side effect, the size of the module was reduced by
about 9.7% on x86_64:
