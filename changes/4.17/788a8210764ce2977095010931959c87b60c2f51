net/mlx5e: IPSec, Add support for ESP trailer removal by hardware

Current hardware decrypts and authenticates incoming ESP packets.
Subsequently, the software extracts the nexthdr field, truncates the
trailer and adjusts csum accordingly.

With this patch and a capable device, the trailer is being removed
by the hardware and the nexthdr field is conveyed via PET. This way
we avoid both the need to access the trailer (cache miss) and to
compute its relative checksum, which significantly improve
the performance.

Experiment shows that trailer removal improves the performance by
2Gbps, (netperf). Both forwarding and host-to-host configurations.
