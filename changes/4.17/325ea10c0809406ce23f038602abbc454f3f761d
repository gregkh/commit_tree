sched/headers: Simplify and clean up header usage in the scheduler

Do the following cleanups and simplifications:

 - sched/sched.h already includes <asm/paravirt.h>, so no need to
   include it in sched/core.c again.

 - order the <linux/sched/*.h> headers alphabetically

 - add all <linux/sched/*.h> headers to kernel/sched/sched.h

 - remove all unnecessary includes from the .c files that
   are already included in kernel/sched/sched.h.

Finally, make all scheduler .c files use a single common header:

  #include "sched.h"

... which now contains a union of the relied upon headers.

This makes the various .c files easier to read and easier to handle.
