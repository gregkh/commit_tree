gfs2: Stop using rhashtable_walk_peek

Function rhashtable_walk_peek is problematic because there is no
guarantee that the glock previously returned still exists; when that key
is deleted, rhashtable_walk_peek can end up returning a different key,
which will cause an inconsistent glock dump.  Fix this by keeping track
of the current glock in the seq file iterator functions instead.
