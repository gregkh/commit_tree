bus: ti-sysc: Handle some devices in omap_device compatible way

Now that ti-sysc can manage child devices, we must also be backwards
compatible with the current omap_device code. With omap_device, we
assume that the child device manages the interconnect target module
directly.

The drivers needing special handling are the ones that still set
pm_runtime_irq_safe(). In the long run we want to update those drivers
as otherwise they will cause problems with genpd as a permanent PM
runtime usage count is set on the parent device.

We can handle omap_device these devices by improving the ti-sysc quirk
handling to detect the devices needing special handling based on
register map and revision register if usable. We also need to implement
dev_pm_domain for these child devices just like omap_device does.
