KVM: arm64: Cleanup __activate_traps and __deactive_traps for VHE and non-VHE

To make the code more readable and to avoid the overhead of a function
call, let's get rid of a pair of the alternative function selectors and
explicitly call the VHE and non-VHE functions using the has_vhe() static
key based selector instead, telling the compiler to try to inline the
static function if it can.
