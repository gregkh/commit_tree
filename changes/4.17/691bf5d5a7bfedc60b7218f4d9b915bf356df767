pinctrl: qcom: Don't allow protected pins to be requested

Some qcom platforms make some GPIOs or pins unavailable for use
by non-secure operating systems, and thus reading or writing the
registers for those pins will cause access control issues and
reset the device. With a DT/ACPI property to describe the set of
pins that are available for use, parse the available pins and set
the irq valid bits for gpiolib to know what to consider 'valid'.
This should avoid any issues with gpiolib. Furthermore, implement
the pinmux_ops::request function so that pinmux can also make
sure to not use pins that are unavailable.
