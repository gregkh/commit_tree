media: ov5645: add missing of_node_put() in error path

The device node obtained with of_graph_get_next_endpoint() should be
released by calling of_node_put().  But it was not released when
v4l2_fwnode_endpoint_parse() failed.

This change moves the of_node_put() call before the error check and
fixes the issue.
