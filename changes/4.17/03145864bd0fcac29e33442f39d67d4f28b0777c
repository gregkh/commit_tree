sfp: support 1G BiDi (eg, FiberStore SFP-GE-BX) modules

Some BiDi modules (eg, FiberStore SFP-GE-BX) are not compliant with
1000BASE-BX as they use different wavelengths from the 1000BASE-BX
standard (eg, 1310nm/1550nm rather than 1310nm/1490nm).  These modules
support 1000BASE-X ethernet, so detect them by a failure to find any
other support, the 8B10B encoding and a bit rate that falls within the
1Gbps window.
