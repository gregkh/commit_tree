net: Convert ip6_frags_ops

Exit methods calls inet_frags_exit_net() with global ip6_frags
as argument. So, after we make the pernet_operations async,
a pair of exit methods may be called to iterate this hash table.
Since there is inet_frag_worker(), which already may work
in parallel with inet_frags_exit_net(), and it can make the same
cleanup, that inet_frags_exit_net() does, it's safe. So we may
mark these pernet_operations as async.
