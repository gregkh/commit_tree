ARM: OMAP2+: Cleanup omap_mcbsp_dev_attr and other legacy data

The omap_mcbsp_dev_attr data was used to supply instance-specific
data for legacy non-DT devices. The legacy McBSP device support
including the usage of the hwmod class revision data has been
dropped in commit 48f6693790aa ("ARM: OMAP2+: Remove unused legacy
code for McBSP") and this data is therefore no longer needed.
So, cleanup the structure and all the associated data in various
hwmod data files.
