ASoC: Intel: bytcr_rt5651: Rename IN3_MAP to IN1_HS_IN3_MAP

All the mappings are named for where the internal mic is routed and in that
sense the newly added in3_map really is the same as in1_map, what makes it
different is that it maps the headset mic at IN3 rather then at IN2.

Rename in3_map to in1_hs_in3_map to better reflect what it actually does.
