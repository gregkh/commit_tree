net/mlx4_en: Fix an error handling path in 'mlx4_en_init_netdev()'

If an error occurs, 'mlx4_en_destroy_netdev()' is called.
It then calls 'mlx4_en_free_resources()' which does the needed resources
cleanup.

So, doing some explicit kfree in the error handling path would lead to
some double kfree.

Simplify code to avoid such a case.
