kdb: drop newline in unknown command output

When an unknown command is entered, kdb prints "Unknown kdb command:"
and then the unknown text, including the newline character. This
causes the ending single-quote mark to be printed on the next line
by itself, so just change the ending newline character to a null
character (end of string) so that it won't be "printed."
