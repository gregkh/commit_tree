x86/ioport: add ksys_ioperm() helper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_ioperm()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the
sys_ioperm() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is meant
as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the same
calling convention as sys_ioperm().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
