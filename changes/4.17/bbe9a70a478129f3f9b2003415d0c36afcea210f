tick-sched: avoid a maybe-uninitialized warning

The use of bitfields seems to confuse gcc, leading to a false-positive
warning in all compiler versions:

kernel/time/tick-sched.c: In function 'tick_nohz_idle_exit':
kernel/time/tick-sched.c:538:2: error: 'now' may be used uninitialized in this function [-Werror=maybe-uninitialized]

This introduces a temporary variable to track the flags so gcc
doesn't have to evaluate twice, eliminating the code path that
leads to the warning.
