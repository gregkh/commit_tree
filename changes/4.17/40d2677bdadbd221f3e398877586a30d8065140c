ASoC: rt298: don't turn off HV and VREF if headset is detected

"HV" and "VREF" will be powered up when jack type detection process is
started and will be powered off when jack type detection process is finished.
It will generate an unexpected interrupt signal when they are powered
up during the capture process. Codec driver will do the jack type detection
process and we can't capture properly before the jack detection process is
finished. This patch will not power off the "HV" and "VREF" widgets if
headset is detected and it will solve the unexpected interrupt issue. As a
result, it will also solve the silence data captured at the beginning in
headset mic recording issue.
