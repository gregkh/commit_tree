tracing: Add per-element variable support to tracing_map

In order to allow information to be passed between trace events, add
support for per-element variables to tracing_map.  This provides a
means for histograms to associate a value or values with an entry when
it's saved or updated, and retrieved by a subsequent event occurrences.

Variables can be set using tracing_map_set_var() and read using
tracing_map_read_var().  tracing_map_var_set() returns true or false
depending on whether or not the variable has been set or not, which is
important for event-matching applications.

tracing_map_read_var_once() reads the variable and resets it to the
'unset' state, implementing read-once variables, which are also
important for event-matching uses.
