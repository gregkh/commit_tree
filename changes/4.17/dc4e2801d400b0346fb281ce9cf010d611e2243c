ring-buffer: Redefine the unimplemented RINGBUF_TYPE_TIME_STAMP

RINGBUF_TYPE_TIME_STAMP is defined but not used, and from what I can
gather was reserved for something like an absolute timestamp feature
for the ring buffer, if not a complete replacement of the current
time_delta scheme.

This code redefines RINGBUF_TYPE_TIME_STAMP to implement absolute time
stamps.  Another way to look at it is that it essentially forces
extended time_deltas for all events.

The motivation for doing this is to enable time_deltas that aren't
dependent on previous events in the ring buffer, making it feasible to
use the ring_buffer_event timetamps in a more random-access way, for
purposes other than serial event printing.

To set/reset this mode, use tracing_set_timestamp_abs() from the
previous interface patch.
