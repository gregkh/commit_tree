scsi: lpfc: Fix soft lockup in lpfc worker thread during LIP testing

During link bounce testing in a point-to-point topology, the host may
enter a soft lockup on the lpfc_worker thread:

    Call Trace:
     lpfc_work_done+0x1f3/0x1390 [lpfc]
     lpfc_do_work+0x16f/0x180 [lpfc]
     kthread+0xc7/0xe0
     ret_from_fork+0x3f/0x70

The driver was simultaneously setting a combination of flags that caused
lpfc_do_work()to effectively spin between slow path work and new event
data, causing the lockup.

Ensure in the typical wq completions, that new event data flags are set
if the slow path flag is running. The slow path will eventually
reschedule the wq handling.
