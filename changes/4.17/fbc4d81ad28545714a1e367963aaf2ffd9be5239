firmware: arm_scmi: refactor in preparation to support per-protocol channels

In order to support per-protocol channels if available, we need to
factor out all the mailbox channel information(Tx/Rx payload and
channel handle) out of the main SCMI instance information structure.

This patch refactors the existing channel information into a separate
chan_info structure.
