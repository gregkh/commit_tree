cxl: Enable NORST bit in PSL_DEBUG register for PSL9

We enable the NORST bit by default for debug afu images to prevent
reset of AFU trace-data on a PCI link drop. For production AFU images
this bit is always ignored and PSL gets reconfigured anyways thereby
resetting the trace data. So setting this bit for non-debug images
doesn't have any impact.
