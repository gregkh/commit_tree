perf tools: Use target->per_thread and target->system_wide flags

Mathieu Poirier reports issue in commit ("73c0ca1eee3d perf thread_map:
Enumerate all threads from /proc") that it has negative impact on 'perf
record --per-thread'. It has the effect of creating a kernel event for
each thread in the system for 'perf record --per-thread'.

Mathieu Poirier's patch ("perf util: Do not reuse target->per_thread flag")
can fix this issue by creating a new target->all_threads flag.

This patch is based on Mathieu Poirier's patch but it doesn't use a new
target->all_threads flag. This patch just uses 'target->per_thread &&
target->system_wide' as a condition to check for all threads case.
