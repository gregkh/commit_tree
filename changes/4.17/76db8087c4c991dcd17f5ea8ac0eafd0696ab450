net: bpf: add a test for skb_segment in test_bpf module

Without the previous commit,
"modprobe test_bpf" will have the following errors:
...
[   98.149165] ------------[ cut here ]------------
[   98.159362] kernel BUG at net/core/skbuff.c:3667!
[   98.169756] invalid opcode: 0000 [#1] SMP PTI
[   98.179370] Modules linked in:
[   98.179371]  test_bpf(+)
...
which triggers the bug the previous commit intends to fix.

The skbs are constructed to mimic what mlx5 may generate.
The packet size/header may not mimic real cases in production. But
the processing flow is similar.
