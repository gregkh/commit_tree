KVM: arm64: Remove noop calls to timer save/restore from VHE switch

The VHE switch function calls __timer_enable_traps and
__timer_disable_traps which don't do anything on VHE systems.
Therefore, simply remove these calls from the VHE switch function and
make the functions non-conditional as they are now only called from the
non-VHE switch path.
