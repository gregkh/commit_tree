locking/Kconfig: Restructure the lock debugging menu

Two config options in the lock debugging menu that are probably the most
frequently used, as far as I am concerned, is the PROVE_LOCKING and
LOCK_STAT. From a UI perspective, they should be front and center. So
these two options are now moved to the top of the lock debugging menu.

The DEBUG_WW_MUTEX_SLOWPATH option is also added to the PROVE_LOCKING
umbrella.
