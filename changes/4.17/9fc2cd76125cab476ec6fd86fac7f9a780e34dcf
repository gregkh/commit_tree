mmc: sdhci-omap: Add tuning support

MMC tuning procedure is required to support SD card
UHS1-SDR104 mode and EMMC HS200 mode.

SDR104/HS200 DLL Tuning Procedure for AM572x platform is mentioned
in Figure 25-51. SDR104/HS200 DLL Tuning Procedure of
AM572x Sitara Processors Silicon Revision 2.0, 1.1 TRM
(SPRUHZ6I - October 2014â€“Revised April 2017 [1]).

The tuning function sdhci_omap_execute_tuning() will only be
called by the MMC/SD core if the corresponding speed modes
are supported by the OMAP silicon which is set in the mmc
host "caps" field.
