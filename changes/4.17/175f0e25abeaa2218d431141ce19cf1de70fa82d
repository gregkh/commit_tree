sched/core: Fix rules for running on online && !active CPUs

As already enforced by the WARN() in __set_cpus_allowed_ptr(), the rules
for running on an online && !active CPU are stricter than just being a
kthread, you need to be a per-cpu kthread.

If you're not strictly per-CPU, you have better CPUs to run on and
don't need the partially booted one to get your work done.

The exception is to allow smpboot threads to bootstrap the CPU itself
and get kernel 'services' initialized before we allow userspace on it.
