ethtool: Add support for configuring PFC stall prevention in ethtool

In the event where the device unexpectedly becomes unresponsive
for a long period of time, flow control mechanism may propagate
pause frames which will cause congestion spreading to the entire
network.
To prevent this scenario, when the device is stalled for a period
longer than a pre-configured timeout, flow control mechanisms are
automatically disabled.

This patch adds support for the ETHTOOL_PFC_STALL_PREVENTION
as a tunable.
This API provides support for configuring flow control storm prevention
timeout (msec).
