crypto: speck - export common helpers

Export the Speck constants and transform context and the ->setkey(),
->encrypt(), and ->decrypt() functions so that they can be reused by the
ARM NEON implementation of Speck-XTS.  The generic key expansion code
will be reused because it is not performance-critical and is not
vectorizable, while the generic encryption and decryption functions are
needed as fallbacks and for the XTS tweak encryption.
