virtio_balloon: add array of stat names

Jason Wang points out that it's very hard for users to build an array of
stat names. The naive thing is to use VIRTIO_BALLOON_S_NR but that
breaks if we add more stats - as done e.g. recently by commit 6c64fe7f2
("virtio_balloon: export hugetlb page allocation counts").

Let's add an array of reasonably readable names.

Fixes: 6c64fe7f2 ("virtio_balloon: export hugetlb page allocation counts")
