sctp: handle two v4 addrs comparison in sctp_inet6_cmp_addr

Since sctp ipv6 socket also supports v4 addrs, it's possible to
compare two v4 addrs in pf v6 .cmp_addr, sctp_inet6_cmp_addr.

However after Commit 1071ec9d453a ("sctp: do not check port in
sctp_inet6_cmp_addr"), it no longer calls af1->cmp_addr, which
in this case is sctp_v4_cmp_addr, but calls __sctp_v6_cmp_addr
where it handles them as two v6 addrs. It would cause a out of
bounds crash.

syzbot found this crash when trying to bind two v4 addrs to a
v6 socket.

This patch fixes it by adding the process for two v4 addrs in
sctp_inet6_cmp_addr.

Fixes: 1071ec9d453a ("sctp: do not check port in sctp_inet6_cmp_addr")
