stm class: Use vmalloc for the master map

Fengguang is running into a warning from the buddy allocator:

> swapper/0: page allocation failure: order:9, mode:0x14040c0(GFP_KERNEL|__GFP_COMP), nodemask=(null)
> CPU: 1 PID: 1 Comm: swapper/0 Not tainted 4.17.0-rc1 #262
> Hardware name: QEMU Standard PC (i440FX + PIIX, 1996), BIOS 1.10.2-1 04/01/2014
> Call Trace:

>  stm_register_device+0xf3/0x5c0: stm_register_device at drivers/hwtracing/stm/core.c:695
...

Which is basically a result of the stm class trying to allocate ~512kB
for the dummy_stm with its default parameters. There's no reason, however,
for it not to be vmalloc()ed instead, which is what this patch does.
