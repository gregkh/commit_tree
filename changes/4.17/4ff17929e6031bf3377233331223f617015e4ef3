i40e/i40evf: Don't bother setting the CLEARPBA bit

The CLEARPBA bit in the dynamic interrupt control register actually has
no effect either way on the hardware. As per errata 28 in the XL710
specification update the interrupt is actually cleared any time the
register is written with the INTENA_MSK bit set to 0. As such the act of
toggling the enable bit actually will trigger the interrupt being
cleared and could lead to potential lost events if auto-masking is
not enabled.
