tracing: Combine enum and arrays into single macro in filter code

Instead of having a separate enum that is the index into another array, like
a string array, make a single macro that combines them into a single list,
and then the two can not get out of sync. This makes it easier to add and
remove items.

The macro trick is:

 #define DOGS				\
  C( JACK,     "Jack Russell")		\
  C( ITALIAN,  "Italian Greyhound")	\
  C( GERMAN,   "German Shepherd")

 #undef C
 #define C(a, b) a

 enum { DOGS };

 #undef C
 #define C(a, b) b

 static char dogs[] = { DOGS };
