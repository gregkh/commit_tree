xprtrdma: Fix corner cases when handling device removal

Michal Kalderon has found some corner cases around device unload
with active NFS mounts that I didn't have the imagination to test
when xprtrdma device removal was added last year.

- The ULP device removal handler is responsible for deallocating
  the PD. That wasn't clear to me initially, and my own testing
  suggested it was not necessary, but that is incorrect.

- The transport destruction path can no longer assume that there
  is a valid ID.

- When destroying a transport, ensure that ib_free_cq() is not
  invoked on a CQ that was already released.
