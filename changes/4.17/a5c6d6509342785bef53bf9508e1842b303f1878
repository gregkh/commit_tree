mm, page_alloc: extend kernelcore and movablecore for percent

Both kernelcore= and movablecore= can be used to define the amount of
ZONE_NORMAL and ZONE_MOVABLE on a system, respectively.  This requires
the system memory capacity to be known when specifying the command line,
however.

This introduces the ability to define both kernelcore= and movablecore=
as a percentage of total system memory.  This is convenient for systems
software that wants to define the amount of ZONE_MOVABLE, for example,
as a proportion of a system's memory rather than a hardcoded byte value.

To define the percentage, the final character of the parameter should be
a '%'.

mhocko: "why is anyone using these options nowadays?"

:
: Fragmentation of non-__GFP_MOVABLE pages due to low on memory
: situations can pollute most pageblocks on the system, as much as 1GB of
: slab being fragmented over 128GB of memory, for example.  When the
: amount of kernel memory is well bounded for certain systems, it is
: better to aggressively reclaim from existing MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE
: pageblocks rather than eagerly fallback to others.
:
: We have additional patches that help with this fragmentation if you're
: interested, specifically kcompactd compaction of MIGRATE_UNMOVABLE
: pageblocks triggered by fallback of non-__GFP_MOVABLE allocations and
: draining of pcp lists back to the zone free area to prevent stranding.
