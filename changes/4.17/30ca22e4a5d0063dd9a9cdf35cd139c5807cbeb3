ipv6: Revert "ipv6: Allow non-gateway ECMP for IPv6"

This reverts commit edd7ceb78296 ("ipv6: Allow non-gateway ECMP for
IPv6").

Eric reported a division by zero in rt6_multipath_rebalance() which is
caused by above commit that considers identical local routes to be
siblings. The division by zero happens because a nexthop weight is not
set for local routes.

Revert the commit as it does not fix a bug and has side effects.

To reproduce:

# ip -6 address add 2001:db8::1/64 dev dummy0
# ip -6 address add 2001:db8::1/64 dev dummy1
