RDMA/mlx5: Fix multiple NULL-ptr deref errors in rereg_mr flow

Failure in rereg MR releases UMEM but leaves the MR to be destroyed
by the user. As a result the following scenario may happen:
"create MR -> rereg MR with failure -> call to rereg MR again" and
hit "NULL-ptr deref or user memory access" errors.

Ensure that rereg MR is only performed on a non-dead MR.
