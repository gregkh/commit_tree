staging: lustre: lov: use correct env in lov_io_data_version_end()

lov - the logical object volume manager - is responsible for
striping data across multiple volumes.

So when it is given a request, it creates one or more
sub-requests, one for each target volume.  Each sub_io
request has a sub_env environment which it operates in.

When lov_io_data_version_end() calls lov_io_end_wrapper() to
wait for and close off a sub_io, it passes the wrong
environment.

This causes an LINVRNT() to fail in cl2osc_io(), and may
cause other problems.

This patch changes the call to use ->sub_env, much like
other code in the same file.
