drm/sun4i: engine: Add a custom crtc atomic_check

We have some restrictions on what the planes and CRTC can provide that are
tied to only one generation of display engines.

For example, on the first generation, we can only have one YUV plane or one
plane that uses the frontend output.

Let's allow our engines to provide an atomic_check callback to validate the
current configuration.
