asm-generic/io.h: move ioremap_nocache/ioremap_uc/ioremap_wc/ioremap_wt out of ifndef CONFIG_MMU

It allows some architectures to use this generic macro instead of
defining theirs.

sparc: io: To use the define of ioremap_[nocache|wc|wb] in asm-generic/io.h
It will move the ioremap_nocache out of the CONFIG_MMU ifdef. This means that
in order to suppress re-definition errors we need to remove the #define
in arch/sparc/include/asm/io_32.h. Also, the change adds a prototype for
ioremap where size is size_t and offset is phys_addr_t so fix that as well.
