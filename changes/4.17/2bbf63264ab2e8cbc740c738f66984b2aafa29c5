powerpc/mm/32: Use page_is_ram to check for RAM

On systems where there is MMIO space between different blocks of RAM in
the physical address space, __ioremap_caller did not allow mapping these
MMIO areas, because they were below the end RAM and thus considered RAM
as well.  Use the memblock-based page_is_ram function, which returns
false for such MMIO holes.

v2:
  Keep the check for p < virt_to_phys(high_memory). On 32-bit systems
  with high memory (memory above physical address 4GiB), the high memory
  is expected to be available though ioremap. The high_memory variable
  marks the end of low memory; comparing against it means that only
  ioremap requests for low RAM will be denied.
