scsi: scsi_dh: Don't look for NULL devices handlers by name

Currently scsi_dh_lookup() doesn't check for NULL as a device name. This
combined with nvme over dm-mpath results in the following messages
emitted by device-mapper:

 device-mapper: multipath: Could not failover device 259:67: Handler scsi_dh_(null) error 14.

Let scsi_dh_lookup() fail fast on NULL names.

[mkp: typo fix]
