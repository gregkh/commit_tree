f2fs: fix to handle looped node chain during recovery

There is no checksum in node block now, so bit-transition from hardware
can make node_footer.next_blkaddr being corrupted w/o any detection,
result in node chain becoming looped one.

For this condition, during recovery, in order to avoid running into dead
loop, let's detect it and just skip out.
