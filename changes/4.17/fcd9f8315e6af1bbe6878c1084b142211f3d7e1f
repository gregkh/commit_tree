perf: arm_spe: include linux/vmalloc.h for vmap()

On linux-next, I get a build failure in some configurations:

drivers/perf/arm_spe_pmu.c: In function 'arm_spe_pmu_setup_aux':
drivers/perf/arm_spe_pmu.c:857:14: error: implicit declaration of function 'vmap'; did you mean 'swap'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]
  buf->base = vmap(pglist, nr_pages, VM_MAP, PAGE_KERNEL);
              ^~~~
              swap
drivers/perf/arm_spe_pmu.c:857:37: error: 'VM_MAP' undeclared (first use in this function); did you mean 'VM_MPX'?
  buf->base = vmap(pglist, nr_pages, VM_MAP, PAGE_KERNEL);
                                     ^~~~~~
                                     VM_MPX
drivers/perf/arm_spe_pmu.c:857:37: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in

drivers/perf/arm_spe_pmu.c:878:2: error: implicit declaration of function 'vunmap'; did you mean 'iounmap'? [-Werror=implicit-function-declaration]

vmap() is declared in linux/vmalloc.h, so we should include that header file.
