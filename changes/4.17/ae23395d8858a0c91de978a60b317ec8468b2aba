inode: don't memset the inode address space twice

Noticed when looking at why cycling 600k inodes/s through the inode
cache was taking a total of 8% cpu in memset() during inode
initialisation.  There is no need to zero the inode.i_data structure
twice.

This increases single threaded bulkstat throughput from ~200,000
inodes/s to ~220,000 inodes/s, so we save a substantial amount of
CPU time per inode init by doing this.
