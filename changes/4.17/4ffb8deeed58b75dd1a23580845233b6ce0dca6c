drm: NULL pointer dereference [null-pointer-deref] (CWE 476) problem

The Parfait (version 2.1.0) static code analysis tool found the
following NULL pointer derefernce problem.

- drivers/gpu/drm/drm_vblank.c
Null pointer checks were added to return values from calls to
drm_crtc_from_index().  There is a possibility, however minute, that
crtc->index may not be found when trying to find the struct crtc
from it's assigned index given in drm_crtc_init_with_planes().
3 return checks for NULL where added with a call to
WARN_ON(!crtc).
