lib/raid6/altivec: Add vpermxor implementation for raid6 Q syndrome

This patch uses the vpermxor instruction to optimise the raid6 Q
syndrome. This instruction was made available with POWER8, ISA version
2.07. It allows for both vperm and vxor instructions to be done in a
single instruction. This has been tested for correctness on a ppc64le
vm with a basic RAID6 setup containing 5 drives.

The performance benchmarks are from the raid6test in the
/lib/raid6/test directory. These results are from an IBM Firestone
machine with ppc64le architecture. The benchmark results show a 35%
speed increase over the best existing algorithm for powerpc (altivec).
The raid6test has also been run on a big-endian ppc64 vm to ensure it
also works for big-endian architectures.

Performance benchmarks:
  raid6: altivecx4 gen() 18773 MB/s
  raid6: altivecx8 gen() 19438 MB/s

  raid6: vpermxor4 gen() 25112 MB/s
  raid6: vpermxor8 gen() 26279 MB/s
