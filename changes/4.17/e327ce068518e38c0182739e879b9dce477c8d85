ceph: optimizing cap allocation

When setting high volume of caps_min_count or having many
unreserved caps, unused caps may always keep in the ->caps_list
even can't get new cap from kmem_cache_alloc because lack of
maximum limitation of caps_avail_count. Hence reuse caps in
->caps_list if available, it's maybe better than setting max
limitation of caps_avail_count and releasing unused caps when
reaching the limit.
