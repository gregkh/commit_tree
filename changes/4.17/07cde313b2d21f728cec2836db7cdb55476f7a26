x86/msr: Allow rdmsr_safe_on_cpu() to schedule

High latencies can be observed caused by a daemon periodically reading
various MSR on all cpus. On KASAN enabled kernels ~10ms latencies can be
observed simply reading one MSR. Even without KASAN, sending an IPI to a
CPU, which is in a deep sleep state or in a long hard IRQ disabled section,
waiting for the answer can consume hundreds of microseconds.

All usage sites are in preemptible context, convert rdmsr_safe_on_cpu() to
use a completion instead of busy polling.

Overall daemon cpu usage was reduced by 35 %, and latencies caused by
msr_read() disappeared.
