KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Kick new VCPU on interrupt migration

When vgic_prune_ap_list() finds an interrupt that needs to be migrated
to a new VCPU, we should notify this VCPU of the pending interrupt,
since it requires immediate action.
Kick this VCPU once we have added the new IRQ to the list, but only
after dropping the locks.
