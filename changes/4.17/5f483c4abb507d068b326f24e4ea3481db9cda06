ocfs2: add kobject for online file check

Use embedded kobject mechanism for online file check feature, this will
avoid to use a global list to save/search per-device online file check
related data, meanwhile, reduce the code lines and make the code logic
clear.  The changed code is based on Goldwyn Rodrigues's patches and
ext4 fs code.
