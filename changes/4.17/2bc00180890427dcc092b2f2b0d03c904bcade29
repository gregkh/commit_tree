iommu/amd: Split domain id out of amd_iommu_devtable_lock

domain_id_alloc() and domain_id_free() is used for id management. Those
two function share a bitmap (amd_iommu_pd_alloc_bitmap) and set/clear
bits based on id allocation. There is no need to share this with
amd_iommu_devtable_lock, it can use its own lock for this operation.
