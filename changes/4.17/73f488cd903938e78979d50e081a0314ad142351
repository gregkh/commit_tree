apparmor: convert attaching profiles via xattrs to use dfa matching

This converts profile attachment based on xattrs to a fixed extended
conditional using dfa matching.

This has a couple of advantages
- pattern matching can be used for the xattr match

- xattrs can be optional for an attachment or marked as required

- the xattr attachment conditional will be able to be combined with
  other extended conditionals when the flexible extended conditional
  work lands.

The xattr fixed extended conditional is appended to the xmatch
conditional. If an xattr attachment is specified the profile xmatch
will be generated regardless of whether there is a pattern match on
the executable name.
