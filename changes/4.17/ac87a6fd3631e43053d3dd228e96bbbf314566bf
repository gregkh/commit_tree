drm/i915: Also check view->type for a normal GGTT view

We cannot simply use !view as shorthand for all normal GGTT views as a
few callers will always populate a i915_ggtt_view struct and set the
type to NORMAL instead. So check for (!view || view->type == NORMAL)
inside i915_gem_object_ggtt_pin().
