tipc: some cleanups in the file discover.c

To facilitate the coming changes in the neighbor discovery functionality
we make some renaming and refactoring of that code. The functional changes
in this commit are trivial, e.g., that we move the message sending call in
tipc_disc_timeout() outside the spinlock protected region.
