rcu: Remove redundant nxttail index macro define

RCU's nxttail has been optimized to be a rcu_segcblist, which is
a multi-tailed linked list with macros defined for the indexes for
each tail.  The indexes have been defined in linux/rcu_segcblist.h,
so this commit removes the redundant definitions in kernel/rcu/tree.h.
