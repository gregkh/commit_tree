media: v4l2-subdev: get rid of __V4L2_SUBDEV_MK_GET_TRY() macro

The __V4L2_SUBDEV_MK_GET_TRY() macro is used to define
3 functions that have the same arguments. The code of those
functions is simple enough to just declare them, de-obfuscating
the code.

While here, replace BUG_ON() by WARN_ON() as there's no reason
why to panic the Kernel if this fails.
