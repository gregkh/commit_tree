net_sched: fq: take care of throttled flows before reuse

Normally, a socket can not be freed/reused unless all its TX packets
left qdisc and were TX-completed. However connect(AF_UNSPEC) allows
this to happen.

With commit fc59d5bdf1e3 ("pkt_sched: fq: clear time_next_packet for
reused flows") we cleared f->time_next_packet but took no special
action if the flow was still in the throttled rb-tree.

Since f->time_next_packet is the key used in the rb-tree searches,
blindly clearing it might break rb-tree integrity. We need to make
sure the flow is no longer in the rb-tree to avoid this problem.
