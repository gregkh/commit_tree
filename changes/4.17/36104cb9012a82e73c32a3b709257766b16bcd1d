x86/xen: Delay get_cpu_cap until stack canary is established

Commit 2cc42bac1c79 ("x86-64/Xen: eliminate W+X mappings") introduced a
call to get_cpu_cap, which is fstack-protected.  This is works on x86-64
as commit 4f277295e54c ("x86/xen: init %gs very early to avoid page
faults with stack protector") ensures the stack protector is configured,
but it it did not cover x86-32.

Delay calling get_cpu_cap until after xen_setup_gdt has initialized the
stack canary.  Without this, a 32bit PV machine crashes early
in boot.
(XEN) Domain 0 (vcpu#0) crashed on cpu#0:
(XEN) ----[ Xen-4.6.6-xc  x86_64  debug=n  Tainted:    C ]----
(XEN) CPU:    0
(XEN) RIP:    e019:[<00000000c10362f8>]

And the PV kernel IP corresponds to init_scattered_cpuid_features
   0xc10362f8 <+24>:    mov    %gs:0x14,%eax

Fixes 2cc42bac1c79 ("x86-64/Xen: eliminate W+X mappings")
