net: dsa: forward timestamping callbacks to switch drivers

Forward the rx/tx timestamp machinery from the dsa infrastructure to the
switch driver.

On the rx side, defer delivery of skbs until we have an rx timestamp.
This mimicks the behavior of skb_defer_rx_timestamp.

On the tx side, identify PTP packets, clone them, and pass them to the
underlying switch driver before we transmit. This mimicks the behavior
of skb_tx_timestamp.

Adjusted txstamp API to keep the allocation and freeing of the clone
in the same central function by Richard Cochran
