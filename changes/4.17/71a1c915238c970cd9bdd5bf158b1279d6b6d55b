net/ipv6: Increment OUTxxx counters after netfilter hook

At the end of ip6_forward(), IPSTATS_MIB_OUTFORWDATAGRAMS and
IPSTATS_MIB_OUTOCTETS are incremented immediately before the NF_HOOK call
for NFPROTO_IPV6 / NF_INET_FORWARD.  As a result, these counters get
incremented regardless of whether or not the netfilter hook allows the
packet to continue being processed.  This change increments the counters
in ip6_forward_finish() so that it will not happen if the netfilter hook
chooses to terminate the packet, which is similar to how IPv4 works.
