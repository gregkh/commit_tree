Input: leds - fix out of bound access

UI_SET_LEDBIT ioctl() causes the following KASAN splat when used with
led > LED_CHARGING:

[ 1274.663418] BUG: KASAN: slab-out-of-bounds in input_leds_connect+0x611/0x730 [input_leds]
[ 1274.663426] Write of size 8 at addr ffff88003377b2c0 by task ckb-next-daemon/5128

This happens because we were writing to the led structure before making
sure that it exists.
