bcache: fix incorrect sysfs output value of strip size

Stripe size is shown as zero when no strip in back end device:
[root@ceph132 ~]# cat /sys/block/sdd/bcache/stripe_size
0.0k

Actually it should be 1T Bytes (1 << 31 sectors), but in sysfs
interface, stripe_size was changed from sectors to bytes, and move
9 bits left, so the 32 bits variable overflows.

This patch change the variable to a 64 bits type before moving bits.
