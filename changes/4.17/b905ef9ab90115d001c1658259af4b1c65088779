llc: delete timers synchronously in llc_sk_free()

The connection timers of an llc sock could be still flying
after we delete them in llc_sk_free(), and even possibly
after we free the sock. We could just wait synchronously
here in case of troubles.

Note, I leave other call paths as they are, since they may
not have to wait, at least we can change them to synchronously
when needed.

Also, move the code to net/llc/llc_conn.c, which is apparently
a better place.
