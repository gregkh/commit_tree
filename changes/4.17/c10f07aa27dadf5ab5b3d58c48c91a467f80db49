dma/direct: Handle force decryption for DMA coherent buffers in common code

With that in place the generic DMA-direct routines can be used to
allocate non-encrypted bounce buffers, and the x86 SEV case can use
the generic swiotlb ops including nice features such as using CMA
allocations.

Note that I'm not too happy about using sev_active() in DMA-direct, but
I couldn't come up with a good enough name for a wrapper to make it
worth adding.
