usbip: tools: usbipd: exclude exported devices from exportable device list

usbipd includes exported devices in response to exportable device list.
Exclude exported devices from exportable device list to avoid:

- import requests for devices that are exported only to fail the request.
- revealing devices that are imported by a client to another client.
