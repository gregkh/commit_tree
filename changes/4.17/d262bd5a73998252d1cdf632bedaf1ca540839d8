powerpc/mm/slice: Use const pointers to cached slice masks where possible

The slice_mask cache was a basic conversion which copied the slice
mask into caller's structures, because that's how the original code
worked. In most cases the pointer can be used directly instead, saving
a copy and an on-stack structure.

On POWER8, this increases vfork+exec+exit performance by 0.3%
and reduces time to mmap+munmap a 64kB page by 2%.
