ixgbe: prevent ptp_rx_hang from running when in FILTER_ALL mode

On hardware which supports timestamping all packets, the timestamps are
recorded in the packet buffer, and the driver no longer uses or reads
the registers. This makes the logic for checking and clearing Rx
timestamp hangs meaningless.

If we run the ixgbe_ptp_rx_hang() function in this case, then the driver
will continuously spam the log output with "Clearing Rx timestamp hang".
These messages are spurious, and confusing to end users.

The original code in commit a9763f3cb54c ("ixgbe: Update PTP to support
X550EM_x devices", 2015-12-03) did have a flag PTP_RX_TIMESTAMP_IN_REGISTER
which was intended to be used to avoid the Rx timestamp hang check,
however it did not actually check the flag before calling the function.

Do so now in order to stop the checks and prevent the spurious log
messages.
