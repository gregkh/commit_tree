powerpc/eeh: Remove eeh_handle_event()

The function eeh_handle_event(pe) does nothing other than switching
between calling eeh_handle_normal_event(pe) and
eeh_handle_special_event(). However it is only called in two places,
one where pe can't be NULL and the other where it must be NULL (see
eeh_event_handler()) so it does nothing but obscure the flow of
control.

So, remove it.
