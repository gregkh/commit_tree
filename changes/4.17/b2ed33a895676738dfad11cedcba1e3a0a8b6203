MIPS: pm-cps: Block system suspend when a JTAG probe is present

If a JTAG probe is connected to a MIPS cluster, then the CPC detects it
and latches the CPC.STAT_CONF.EJTAG_PROBE bit to 1. While set,
attempting to send a power-down command to a core will be blocked, and
the CPC will instead send the core to clock-off state. This can
interfere with systems fully entering a low power state where all cores,
CM, GIC, etc are powered down.

Detect that a JTAG probe is / has been connected to the cluster and
block the suspend attempt.

Attempting to suspend the system while a JTAG probe is connected now
yields:
 # echo mem > /sys/power/state
 [   11.654000] PM: Syncing filesystems ... done.
 [   11.658000] JTAG probe is connected - abort suspend
 -sh: echo: write error: Operation not permitted
 #

To restore suspend, the JTAG probe should be disconnected or put into
quiescent state. Platform code can then clear the
CPC.STAT_CONF.EJTAG_PROBE bit.
