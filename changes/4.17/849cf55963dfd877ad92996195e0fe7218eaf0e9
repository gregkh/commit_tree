fs: don't flush pagecache when expanding block device

When changing the size of a block device, its all caches are freed.
It's necessary on shrinking to prevent spurious I/Os to the disappeared
region.  However, on expanding, such kind of I/Os doesn't happen.

Similar things can be considered for btrfs filesystem resize and
resize2fs, but they are designed not to drop caches when expanding.
Therefore this patch removes unnecessary cache drop.
