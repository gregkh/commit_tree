platform/x86: intel_turbo_max_3: Remove restriction for HWP platforms

On systems supporting HWP (Hardware P-States) mode, we expected to
enumerate core priority via ACPI-CPPC tables. Unfortunately deployment of
TURBO 3.0 didn't use this method to show core priority. So users are not
able to utilize this feature in HWP mode.

So remove the loading restriction of this driver for HWP enabled systems.
Even if there are some systems, which are providing the core priority via
ACPI CPPC, this shouldn't cause any conflict as the source of priority
definition is same.
