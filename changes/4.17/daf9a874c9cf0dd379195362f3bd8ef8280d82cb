mtd: rawnand: makes the Kconfig entry clear when it comes to raw NANDs

Files have been moved in the NAND subsystem to reflect the different
flavors of NAND devices.

Raw/Parallel NAND devices have been moved to a "raw" subdirectory to
make the difference with OneNAND and SPI NAND for instance. So adjust
the Kconfig entry to clarify things.
