drm/vmwgfx: Add a cpu blit utility that can be used for page-backed bos

The utility uses kmap_atomic() instead of vmapping the whole buffer
object. As a result there will be more book-keeping but on some
architectures this will help avoid exhausting vmalloc space and also
avoid expensive TLB flushes.

The blit utility also adds a provision to compute a bounding box of
changed content, which is very useful to optimize presentation speed
of ill-behaved applications that don't supply proper damage regions, and
for page-flips. The cost of computing the bounding box is not that
expensive when done in a cpu-blit utility like this.
