powerpc: Add security feature flags for Spectre/Meltdown

This commit adds security feature flags to reflect the settings we
receive from firmware regarding Spectre/Meltdown mitigations.

The feature names reflect the names we are given by firmware on bare
metal machines. See the hostboot source for details.

Arguably these could be firmware features, but that then requires them
to be read early in boot so they're available prior to asm feature
patching, but we don't actually want to use them for patching. We may
also want to dynamically update them in future, which would be
incompatible with the way firmware features work (at the moment at
least). So for now just make them separate flags.
