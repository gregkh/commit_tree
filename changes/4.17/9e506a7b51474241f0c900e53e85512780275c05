PCI: Add pcie_print_link_status() to log link speed and whether it's limited

Add pcie_print_link_status().  This logs the current settings of the link
(speed, width, and total available bandwidth).

If the device is capable of more bandwidth but is limited by a slower
upstream link, we include information about the link that limits the
device's performance.

The user may be able to move the device to a different slot for better
performance.

This provides a unified method for all PCI devices to report status and
issues, instead of each device reporting in a different way, using
different code.
