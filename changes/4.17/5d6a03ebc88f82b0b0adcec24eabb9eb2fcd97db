powerpc/hw_breakpoint: Only disable hw breakpoint if cpu supports it

We get the below warning if we try to use kexec on P9:
   kexec_core: Starting new kernel
   WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 1223 at arch/powerpc/kernel/process.c:826 __set_breakpoint+0xb4/0x140
   [snip]
   NIP __set_breakpoint+0xb4/0x140
   LR  kexec_prepare_cpus_wait+0x58/0x150
   Call Trace:

     system_call+0x58/0x6c

This happens since we are trying to clear hw breakpoint on POWER9,
though we don't have CPU_FTR_DAWR enabled. Guard __set_breakpoint()
within hw_breakpoint_disable() with ppc_breakpoint_available() to
address this.
