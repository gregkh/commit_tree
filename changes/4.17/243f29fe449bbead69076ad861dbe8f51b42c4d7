libnvdimm: add an api to cast a 'struct nd_region' to its 'struct device'

For debug, it is useful for bus providers to be able to retrieve the
'struct device' associated with an nd_region instance that it
registered. We already have to_nd_region() to perform the reverse cast
operation, in fact its duplicate declaration can be removed from the
private drivers/nvdimm/nd.h header.
