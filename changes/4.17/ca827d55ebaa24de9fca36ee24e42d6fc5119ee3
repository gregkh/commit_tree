mm, swap: Add infrastructure for saving page metadata on swap

If a processor supports special metadata for a page, for example ADI
version tags on SPARC M7, this metadata must be saved when the page is
swapped out. The same metadata must be restored when the page is swapped
back in. This patch adds two new architecture specific functions -
arch_do_swap_page() to be called when a page is swapped in, and
arch_unmap_one() to be called when a page is being unmapped for swap
out. These architecture hooks allow page metadata to be saved if the
architecture supports it.
