SUNRPC: Move xprt_update_rtt callsite

Since commit 33849792cbcd ("xprtrdma: Detect unreachable NFS/RDMA
servers more reliably"), the xprtrdma transport now has a ->timer
callout. But xprtrdma does not need to compute RTT data, only UDP
needs that. Move the xprt_update_rtt call into the UDP transport
implementation.
