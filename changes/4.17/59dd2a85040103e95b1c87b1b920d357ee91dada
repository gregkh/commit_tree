regmap: debugfs: Improve warning message on debugfs_create_dir() failure

Currently when debugfs_create_dir() fails we receive a warning message
that provides no indication as to what was the directory entry that
failed to be created.

Improve the warning message by printing the directory name that failed
in order to help debugging.
