net/mlx5: Avoid cleaning flow steering table twice during error flow

When we fail to initialize the RX root namespace, we need
to clean only that and not the entire flow steering.

Currently the code may try to clean the flow steering twice
on error witch leads to null pointer deference.
Make sure we clean correctly.
