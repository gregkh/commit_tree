net: Convert nf_log_net_ops

The pernet_operations would have had a problem in parallel
execution with others, if init_net had been able to released.
But it's not, and the rest is safe for that.
There is memory allocation, which nobody else interested in,
and sysctl registration. So, we make them async.
