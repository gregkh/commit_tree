IB/mlx5: Packet packing enhancement for RAW QP

Enable RAW QP to be able to configure burst control by modify_qp. By
using burst control with rate limiting, user can achieve best
performance and accuracy. The burst control information is passed by
user through udata.

This patch also reports burst control capability for mlx5 related
hardwares, burst control is only marked as supported when both
packet_pacing_burst_bound and packet_pacing_typical_size are
supported.
