coresight: Use %px to print pcsr instead of %p

Commit ad67b74d2469 ("printk: hash addresses printed with %p") lets
printk specifier %p to hash all addresses before printing, this was
resulting in the high 32 bits of pcsr can only output zeros.  So
module cannot completely print pc value and it's pointless for debugging
purpose.

This patch fixes this by using %px to print pcsr instead.
