dm bufio: relax alignment constraint on slab cache

The I/O buffer doesn't have to be aligned on block size granularity,
relax alignment to ARCH_KMALLOC_MINALIGN (required to allow DMA from
slab cache memory on some architectures).

Also, set SLAB_RECLAIM_ACCOUNT so that the memory allocated from the
cache is accounted as reclaimable and doesn't inflate the 'used' entry
in the free command.
