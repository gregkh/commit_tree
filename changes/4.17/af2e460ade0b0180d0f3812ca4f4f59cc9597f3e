s390/cio: update chpid descriptor after resource accessibility event

Channel path descriptors have been seen as something stable (as
long as the chpid is configured). Recent tests have shown that the
descriptor can also be altered when the link state of a channel path
changes. Thus it is necessary to update the descriptor during
handling of resource accessibility events.
