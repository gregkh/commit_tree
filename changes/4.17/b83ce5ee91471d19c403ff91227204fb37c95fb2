x86/mm/64: Make __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT always 52

__PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT is used to define the mask that helps to extract
physical address from a page table entry.

Although real physical address space available may differ between
machines, it's safe to use 52 as __PHYSICAL_MASK_SHIFT. Unused bits
above log2(MAXPHYADDR) up to bit 51 are reserved and must be 0.
