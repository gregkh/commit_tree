powerpc/powernv: Fix OPAL NVRAM driver OPAL_BUSY loops

The OPAL NVRAM driver does not sleep in case it gets OPAL_BUSY or
OPAL_BUSY_EVENT from firmware, which causes large scheduling
latencies, and various lockup errors to trigger (again, BMC reboot
can cause it).

Fix this by converting it to the standard form OPAL_BUSY loop that
sleeps.
