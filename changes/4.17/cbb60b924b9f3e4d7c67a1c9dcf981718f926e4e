fs: add ksys_ioctl() helper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_ioctl()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the
sys_ioctl() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function
is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it
uses the same calling convention as sys_ioctl().

After careful review, at least some of these calls could be converted
to do_vfs_ioctl() in future.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
