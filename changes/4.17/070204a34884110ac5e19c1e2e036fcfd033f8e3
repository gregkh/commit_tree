net/smc: keep clcsock reference in smc_tcp_listen_work()

The internal CLC socket should exist till the SMC-socket is released.
Function tcp_listen_worker() releases the internal CLC socket of a
listen socket, if an smc_close_active() is called. This function
is called for the final release(), but it is called for shutdown
SHUT_RDWR as well. This opens a door for protection faults, if
socket calls using the internal CLC socket are called for a
shutdown listen socket.

With the changes of
commit 3d502067599f ("net/smc: simplify wait when closing listen socket")
there is no need anymore to release the internal CLC socket in
function tcp_listen_worker((). It is sufficient to release it in
smc_release().
