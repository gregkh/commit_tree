btrfs: Fix wrong first_key parameter in replace_path

Commit 581c1760415c ("btrfs: Validate child tree block's level and first
key") introduced new @first_key parameter for read_tree_block(), however
caller in replace_path() is parasing wrong key to read_tree_block().

It should use parameter @first_key other than @key.

Normally it won't expose problem as @key is normally initialzied to the
same value of @first_key we expect.
However in relocation recovery case, @key can be set to (0, 0, 0), and
since no valid key in relocation tree can be (0, 0, 0), it will cause
read_tree_block() to return -EUCLEAN and interrupt relocation recovery.

Fix it by setting @first_key correctly.
