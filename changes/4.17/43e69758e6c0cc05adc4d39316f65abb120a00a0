media: solo6x10: get rid of an address space warning

Instead of using an ancillary function to avoid duplicating
a small portion of code that copies data either to kernelspace
or between userspace-kernelspace, duplicate the code,
as it prevents static analyzers to complain about it:

	drivers/media/pci/solo6x10/solo6x10-g723.c:260:46: warning: cast removes address space of expression

The hole idea of using __user is to make sure that the code is
doing the right thing with address space, so there's no
sense on use casting.
