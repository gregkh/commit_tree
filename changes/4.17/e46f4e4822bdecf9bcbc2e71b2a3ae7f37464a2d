lightnvm: simplify geometry structure

Currently, the device geometry is stored redundantly in the nvm_id and
nvm_geo structures at a device level. Moreover, when instantiating
targets on a specific number of LUNs, these structures are replicated
and manually modified to fit the instance channel and LUN partitioning.

Instead, create a generic geometry around nvm_geo, which can be used by
(i) the underlying device to describe the geometry of the whole device,
and (ii) instances to describe their geometry independently.
