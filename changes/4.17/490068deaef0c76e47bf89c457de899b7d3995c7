qed: Fix LL2 race during connection terminate

Stress on qedi/qedr load unload lead to list_del corruption.
This is due to ll2 connection terminate freeing resources without
verifying that no more ll2 processing will occur.

This patch unregisters the ll2 status block before terminating
the connection to assure this race does not occur.
