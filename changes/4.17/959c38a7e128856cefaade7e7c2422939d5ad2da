ACPICA: Add option to disable Package object name resolution errors

ACPICA commit a6c3c725c44dd44ad9d3f2b2a64351fdbe6e0014

For the kernel-resident ACPICA, optionally be silent about the
NOT_FOUND case. Although this is potentially a serious problem,
it can generate a lot of noise/errors on platforms whose
firmware carries around a bunch of unused Package objects.
To disable these errors, define ACPI_IGNORE_PACKAGE_RESOLUTION_ERRORS
in the OS-specific header.
