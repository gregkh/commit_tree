PCI/portdrv: Remove pcie_port_bus_type link order dependency

The pcie_port_bus_type must be registered before drivers that depend on it
can be registered.  Those drivers include:

  pcied_init()                # PCIe native hotplug driver
  aer_service_init()          # AER driver
  dpc_service_init()          # DPC driver
  pcie_pme_service_init()     # PME driver

Previously we registered pcie_port_bus_type from pcie_portdrv_init(), a
device_initcall.  The callers of pcie_port_service_register() (above) are
also device_initcalls.  This is fragile because the device_initcall
ordering depends on link order, which is not explicit.

Register pcie_port_bus_type from pci_driver_init() along with pci_bus_type.
This removes the link order dependency between portdrv and the pciehp, AER,
DPC, and PCIe PME drivers.
