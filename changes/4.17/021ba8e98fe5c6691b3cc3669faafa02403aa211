xfs: cap the length of deduplication requests

Since deduplication potentially has to read in all the pages in both
files in order to compare the contents, cap the deduplication request
length at MAX_RW_COUNT/2 (roughly 1GB) so that we have /some/ upper bound
on the request length and can't just lock up the kernel forever.  Found
by running generic/304 after commit 1ddae54555b62 ("common/rc: add
missing 'local' keywords").
