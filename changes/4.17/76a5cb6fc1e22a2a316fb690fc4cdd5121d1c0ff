afs: Add stats for data transfer operations

Add statistics to /proc/fs/afs/stats for data transfer RPC operations.  New
lines are added that look like:

	file-rd : n=55794 nb=10252282150
	file-wr : n=9789 nb=3247763645

where n= indicates the number of ops completed and nb= indicates the number
of bytes successfully transferred.  file-rd is the counts for read/fetch
operations and file-wr the counts for write/store operations.

Note that directory and symlink downloading are included in the file-rd
stats at the moment.
