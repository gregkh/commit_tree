mlxsw: spectrum_kvdl: use div_u64() for 64-bit division

Calculating the number of entries now uses 64-bit arithmetic that
causes a link error on 32-bit architectures:

drivers/net/ethernet/mellanox/mlxsw/spectrum_kvdl.o: In function `mlxsw_sp_kvdl_init':
spectrum_kvdl.c:(.text+0x51c): undefined reference to `__aeabi_uldivmod'

We could probably use a 32-bit division here as before, but since this is
not in a performance critical path, div_u64() seems cleaner here.
