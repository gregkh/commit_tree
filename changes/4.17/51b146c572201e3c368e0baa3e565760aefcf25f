x86/apic: Rename variables and functions related to x86_io_apic_ops

The names of x86_io_apic_ops and its two member variables are
misleading:

The ->read() member is to read IO_APIC reg, while ->disable()
which is called by native_disable_io_apic()/irq_remapping_disable_io_apic()
is actually used to restore boot IRQ mode, not to disable the IO-APIC.

So rename x86_io_apic_ops to 'x86_apic_ops' since it doesn't only
handle the IO-APIC, but also the local APIC.

Also rename its member variables and the related callbacks.
