fw_cfg: write vmcoreinfo details

If the "etc/vmcoreinfo" fw_cfg file is present and we are not running
the kdump kernel, write the addr/size of the vmcoreinfo ELF note.

The DMA operation is expected to run synchronously with today qemu,
but the specification states that it may become async, so we run
"control" field check in a loop for eventual changes.
