sched/debug: Move the print_rt_rq() and print_dl_rq() declarations to kernel/sched/sched.h

In the following commit:

  6b55c9654fcc ("sched/debug: Move print_cfs_rq() declaration to kernel/sched/sched.h")

the print_cfs_rq() prototype was added to <kernel/sched/sched.h>,
right next to the prototypes for print_cfs_stats(), print_rt_stats()
and print_dl_stats().

Finish this previous commit and also move related prototypes for
print_rt_rq() and print_dl_rq().

Remove existing extern declarations now that they not needed anymore.

Silences the following GCC warning, triggered by W=1:

  kernel/sched/debug.c:573:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘print_rt_rq’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
  kernel/sched/debug.c:603:6: warning: no previous prototype for ‘print_dl_rq’ [-Wmissing-prototypes]
