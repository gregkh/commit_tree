mm/hmm: use struct for hmm_vma_fault(), hmm_vma_get_pfns() parameters

Both hmm_vma_fault() and hmm_vma_get_pfns() were taking a hmm_range struct
as parameter and were initializing that struct with others of their
parameters.  Have caller of those function do this as they are likely to
already do and only pass this struct to both function this shorten
function signature and make it easier in the future to add new parameters
by simply adding them to the structure.
