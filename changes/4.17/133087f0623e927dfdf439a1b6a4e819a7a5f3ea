ktest.pl: Have ktest.pl pass -r to config-bisect.pl to reset bisect

If config-bisect.pl sees that a config_bisect has already been started, it
will ask on the command line if it should bisect or not. This will mess up
running config_bisect from ktest.pl.

Have ktest.pl pass in '-r' to config-bisect.pl and have config-bisect.pl
recognize that to reset without asking.
