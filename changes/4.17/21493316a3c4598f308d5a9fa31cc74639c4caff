ALSA: usb: mixer: volume quirk for CM102-A+/102S+

Currently it's not possible to set volume lower than 26% (it just mutes).

Also fixes this warning:

  Warning! Unlikely big volume range (=9472), cval->res is probably wrong.
  [13] FU [PCM Playback Volume] ch = 2, val = -9473/-1/1

, and volume works fine for full range.
