net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: add support for GPIO configuration

MV88E6352 and later switches support GPIO control through the "Scratch
& Misc" global2 register. (Older switches do too, though with a slightly
different register interface. Only the 6352-style is implemented here.)

Add a new file, global2_scratch.c, for operations in the Scratch & Misc
space. Additionally, add a GPIO operations structure to present an
abstract view over GPIO manipulation.

Reverse Christmas tree and unsigned has been replaced with unsigned
int by Andrew Lunn.
