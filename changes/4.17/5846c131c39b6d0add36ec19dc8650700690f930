l2tp: hold reference on tunnels in netlink dumps

l2tp_tunnel_find_nth() is unsafe: no reference is held on the returned
tunnel, therefore it can be freed whenever the caller uses it.
This patch defines l2tp_tunnel_get_nth() which works similarly, but
also takes a reference on the returned tunnel. The caller then has to
drop it after it stops using the tunnel.

Convert netlink dumps to make them safe against concurrent tunnel
deletion.
