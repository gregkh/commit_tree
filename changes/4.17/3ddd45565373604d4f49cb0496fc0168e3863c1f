KVM: arm64: Fix HYP idmap unmap when using 52bit PA

Unmapping the idmap range using 52bit PA is quite broken, as we
don't take into account the right number of PGD entries, and rely
on PTRS_PER_PGD. The result is that pgd_index() truncates the
address, and we end-up in the weed.

Let's introduce a new unmap_hyp_idmap_range() that knows about this,
together with a kvm_pgd_index() helper, which hides a bit of the
complexity of the issue.
