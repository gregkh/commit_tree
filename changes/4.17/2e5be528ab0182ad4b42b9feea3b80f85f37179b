clk: imx6ull: use OSC clock during AXI rate change

On i.MX6 ULL using PLL3 seems to cause a freeze when setting
the parent to IMX6UL_CLK_PLL3_USB_OTG. This only seems to appear
since commit 6f9575e55632 ("clk: imx: Add CLK_IS_CRITICAL flag
for busy divider and busy mux"), probably because the clock is
now forced to be on.
