of: overlay: Stop leaking resources on overlay removal

Only the overlay notifier callbacks have a chance to potentially get
hold of references to those two resources, but they are not supposed to
store them beyond OF_OVERLAY_POST_REMOVE.

Document the overlay notifier API, its constraint regarding pointer
lifetime, and then remove intentional leaks of ovcs->overlay_tree and
ovcs->fdt from free_overlay_changeset.
