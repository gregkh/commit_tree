lib: Add generic PIO mapping method

41f8bba7f555 ("of/pci: Add pci_register_io_range() and
pci_pio_to_address()") added support for PCI I/O space mapped into CPU
physical memory space.  With that support, the I/O ranges configured for
PCI/PCIe hosts on some architectures can be mapped to logical PIO and
converted easily between CPU address and the corresponding logical PIO.
Based on this, PCI I/O port space can be accessed via in/out accessors that
use memory read/write.

But on some platforms, there are bus hosts that access I/O port space with
host-local I/O port addresses rather than memory addresses.

Add a more generic I/O mapping method to support those devices.  With this
patch, both the CPU addresses and the host-local port can be mapped into
the logical PIO space with different logical/fake PIOs.  After this, all
the I/O accesses to either PCI MMIO devices or host-local I/O peripherals
can be unified into the existing I/O accessors defined in asm-generic/io.h
and be redirected to the right device-specific hooks based on the input
logical PIO.
