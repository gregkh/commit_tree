powerpc/kexec_file: Fix error code when trying to load kdump kernel

kexec_file_load() on powerpc doesn't support kdump kernels yet, so it
returns -ENOTSUPP in that case.

I've recently learned that this errno is internal to the kernel and
isn't supposed to be exposed to userspace. Therefore, change to
-EOPNOTSUPP which is defined in an uapi header.

This does indeed make kexec-tools happier. Before the patch, on
ppc64le:

  # ~bauermann/src/kexec-tools/build/sbin/kexec -s -p /boot/vmlinuz
  kexec_file_load failed: Unknown error 524

After the patch:

  # ~bauermann/src/kexec-tools/build/sbin/kexec -s -p /boot/vmlinuz
  kexec_file_load failed: Operation not supported
