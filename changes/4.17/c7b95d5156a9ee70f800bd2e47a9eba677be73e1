mm: add ksys_readahead() helper; remove in-kernel calls to sys_readahead()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel calls to the
sys_readahead() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function is
meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it uses the
same calling convention as sys_readahead().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
