powerpc: Update ptrace to use ppc_breakpoint_available()

This updates the ptrace code to use ppc_breakpoint_available().

We now advertise via PPC_PTRACE_GETHWDBGINFO zero breakpoints when the
DAWR is missing (ie. POWER9). This results in GDB falling back to
software emulation of the breakpoint (which is slow).

For the features advertised by PPC_PTRACE_GETHWDBGINFO, we keep
advertising DAWR as if we don't GDB assumes 1 breakpoint irrespective
of the number of breakpoints advertised. GDB then fails later when
trying to set this one breakpoint.
