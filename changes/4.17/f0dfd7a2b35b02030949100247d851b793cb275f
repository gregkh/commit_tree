netfilter: nf_tables: fix memory leak on error exit return

Currently the -EBUSY error return path is not free'ing resources
allocated earlier, leaving a memory leak. Fix this by exiting via the
error exit label err5 that performs the necessary resource clean
up.

Detected by CoverityScan, CID#1432975 ("Resource leak")
