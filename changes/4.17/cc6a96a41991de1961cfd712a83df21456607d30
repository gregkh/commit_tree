i40e: refactor promisc_changed in i40e_sync_vsi_filters

This code here is quite complex and easy to screw up.  Let's see if we
can't improve the readability and maintainability a bit.  This refactors
out promisc_changed into two variables 'old_overflow' and 'new_overflow'
which makes it a bit clearer when we're concerned about when and how
overflow promiscuous is changed.  This also makes so that we no longer
need to pass a boolean pointer to i40e_aqc_add_filters.  Instead we can
simply check if we changed the overflow promiscuous flag since the
function start.
