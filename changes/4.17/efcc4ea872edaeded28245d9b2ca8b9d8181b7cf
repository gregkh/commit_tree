nds32: Correct flush_dcache_page function

1. Disable local irq before d-cache write-back and invalidate.
   The cpu_dcache_wbinval_page function is composed of d-cache
write-back and invalidate. If the local irq is enabled when calling
cpu_dcache_wbinval_page, the content of d-cache is possibly updated
between write-back and invalidate. In this case, the updated data will
be dropped due to the following d-cache invalidation. Therefore, we
disable the local irq before calling cpu_dcache_wbinval_page.

2. Correct the data write-back for page aliasing case.
   Only the page whose (page->index << PAGE_SHIFT) is located at the
same page color as page_address(page) needs to execute data write-back
in flush_dcache_page function.
