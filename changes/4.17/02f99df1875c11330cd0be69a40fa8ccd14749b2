erspan: fix invalid erspan version.

ERSPAN only support version 1 and 2.  When packets send to an
erspan device which does not have proper version number set,
drop the packet.  In real case, we observe multicast packets
sent to the erspan pernet device, erspan0, which does not have
erspan version configured.
