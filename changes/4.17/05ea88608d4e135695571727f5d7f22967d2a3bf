mm, hugetlbfs: introduce ->pagesize() to vm_operations_struct

When device-dax is operating in huge-page mode we want it to behave like
hugetlbfs and report the MMU page mapping size that is being enforced by
the vma.

Similar to commit 31383c6865a5 "mm, hugetlbfs: introduce ->split() to
vm_operations_struct" it would be messy to teach vma_mmu_pagesize()
about device-dax page mapping sizes in the same (hstate) way that
hugetlbfs communicates this attribute.  Instead, these patches introduce
a new ->pagesize() vm operation.
