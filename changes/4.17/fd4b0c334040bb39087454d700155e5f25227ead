ARM: dts: sun9i: Add PRCM device node for the A80 dtsi

The PRCM is a collection of clock controls, reset controls, and various
power switches/gates. Some of these can be independently listed and
supported, while a number of CPU related ones are used in tandem with
CPUCFG for SMP bringup and CPU hotplugging.
