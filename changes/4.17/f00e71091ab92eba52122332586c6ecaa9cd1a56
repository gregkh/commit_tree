regmap: Fix reversed bounds check in regmap_raw_write()

We're supposed to be checking that "val_len" is not too large but
instead we check if it is smaller than the max.

The only function affected would be regmap_i2c_smbus_i2c_write() in
drivers/base/regmap/regmap-i2c.c.  Strangely that function has its own
limit check which returns an error if (count >= I2C_SMBUS_BLOCK_MAX) so
it doesn't look like it has ever been able to do anything except return
an error.

Fixes: c335931ed9d2 ("regmap: Add raw_write/read checks for max_raw_write/read sizes")
