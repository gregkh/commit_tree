blk-mq: remove code for dealing with remapping queue

Firstly, from commit 4b855ad37194 ("blk-mq: Create hctx for each present CPU),
blk-mq doesn't remap queue any more after CPU topo is changed.

Secondly, set->nr_hw_queues can't be bigger than nr_cpu_ids, and now we map
all possible CPUs to hw queues, so at least one CPU is mapped to each hctx.

So queue mapping has became static and fixed just like percpu variable, and
we don't need to handle queue remapping any more.
