KVM: arm/arm64: Move arm64-only vgic-v2-sr.c file to arm64

The vgic-v2-sr.c file now only contains the logic to replay unaligned
accesses to the virtual CPU interface on 16K and 64K page systems, which
is only relevant on 64-bit platforms.  Therefore move this file to the
arm64 KVM tree, remove the compile directive from the 32-bit side
makefile, and remove the ifdef in the C file.

Since this file also no longer saves/restores anything, rename the file
to vgic-v2-cpuif-proxy.c to more accurately describe the logic in this
file.
