media: v4l: vsp1: Fix video output on R8A77970

Commit d455b45f8393 ("v4l: vsp1: Add support for new VSP2-BS, VSP2-DL,
and VSP2-D instances") added support for the VSP2-D found in the R-Car
V3M (R8A77970) but the video output that VSP2-D sends to DU has a greenish
garbage-like line repeated every 8 screen rows. It turns out that R-Car
V3M has the LIF0 buffer attribute register that you need to set to a non-
default value in order to get rid of the output artifacts.

Based on the original (and large) patch by Daisuke Matsushita
<daisuke.matsushita.ns@hitachi.com>.

Fixes: d455b45f8393 ("v4l: vsp1: Add support for new VSP2-BS, VSP2-DL and VSP2-D instances")
[Removed braces, added VI6_IP_VERSION_MASK to improve readabiliy]
