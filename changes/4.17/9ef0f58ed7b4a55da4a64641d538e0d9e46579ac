ath10k: fix use-after-free in ath10k_wmi_cmd_send_nowait

The skb may be freed in tx completion context before
trace_ath10k_wmi_cmd is called. This can be easily captured when
KASAN(Kernel Address Sanitizer) is enabled. The fix is to move
trace_ath10k_wmi_cmd before the send operation. As the ret has no
meaning in trace_ath10k_wmi_cmd then, so remove this parameter too.
