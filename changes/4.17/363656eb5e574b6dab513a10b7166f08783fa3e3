fm10k: fix function doxygen comments

Several function header comments had incorrect function parameter
definitions. Recent versions of the upstream kernel have started to warn
about these issues. Fix up the comments which do not match in order to
resolve these new warnings.

While fixing these, update the copyright year also.
