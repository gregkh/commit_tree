drm/i915: Remove unbannable context spam from reset

During testing, we trigger a lot of resets on an unbannable context
leading to massive amounts of irrelevant debug spam. Remove the
ban_score accounting and message for the unbannable context so that we
improve the signal:noise in the log messages for when the unexpected
occurs.
