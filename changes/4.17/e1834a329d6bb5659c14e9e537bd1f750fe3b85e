net: socket: move check for forbid_cmsg_compat to __sys_...msg()

The non-compat codepaths for sys_...msg() verify that MSG_CMSG_COMPAT
is not set. By moving this check to the __sys_...msg() functions
(and making it dependent on a static flag passed to this function), we
can call the __sys...msg() functions instead of the syscall functions
in all cases. __sys_recvmmsg() does not need this trickery, as the
check is handled within the do_sys_recvmmsg() function internal to
net/socket.c.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
