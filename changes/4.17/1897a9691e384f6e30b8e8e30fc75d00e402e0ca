Documentation: Fix early-microcode.txt references after file rename

The file Documentation/x86/early-microcode.txt was renamed to
Documentation/x86/microcode.txt in 0e3258753f81, but it was still
referenced by its old name in a three places:

* Documentation/x86/00-INDEX
* arch/x86/Kconfig
* arch/x86/kernel/cpu/microcode/amd.c

This commit updates these references accordingly.

Fixes: 0e3258753f81 ("x86/microcode: Document the three loading methods")
