tipc: fix bug in function tipc_nl_node_dump_monitor

Commit 36a50a989ee8 ("tipc: fix infinite loop when dumping link monitor
summary") intended to fix a problem with user tool looping when max
number of bearers are enabled.

Unfortunately, the wrong version of the commit was posted, so the
problem was not solved at all.

This commit adds the missing part.
