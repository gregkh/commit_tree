dm bufio: move dm-bufio.h to include/linux/

Move dm-bufio.h to include/linux/ so that external GPL'd DM target
modules can use it.

It is better to allow the use of dm-bufio than force external modules
to implement the equivalent buffered IO mechanism in some new way.  The
hope is this will encourage the use of dm-bufio; which will then make it
easier for a GPL'd external DM target module to be included upstream.

A couple dm-bufio EXPORT_SYMBOL exports have also been updated to use
EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL.
