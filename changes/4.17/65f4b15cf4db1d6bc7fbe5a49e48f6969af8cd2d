USB: wusbcore: remove redundant re-assignment to pointer 'dev'

Pointer dev is initialized and then re-assigned with the same value
a little later, hence the second assignment is redundant and can be
removed.

Cleans up clang warning:
drivers/usb/wusbcore/wa-nep.c:88:17: warning: Value stored to 'dev'
during its initialization is never read
