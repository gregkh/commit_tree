serial: imx: fix cached UCR2 read on software reset

To reset the UART the SRST needs be cleared (low active). According
to the documentation the bit will remain active for 4 module clocks
until it is cleared (set to 1).

Hence the real register need to be read in case the cached register
indicates that the SRST bit is zero.

This bug lead to wrong baudrate because the baud rate register got
restored before reset completed in imx_flush_buffer.
