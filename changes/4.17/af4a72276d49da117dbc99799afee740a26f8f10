s390/zcrypt: Support up to 256 crypto adapters.

There was an artificial restriction on the card/adapter id
to only 6 bits but all the AP commands do support adapter
ids with 8 bit. This patch removes this restriction to 64
adapters and now up to 256 adapter can get addressed.

Some of the ioctl calls work on the max number of cards
possible (which was 64). These ioctls are now deprecated
but still supported. All the defines, structs and ioctl
interface declarations have been kept for compabibility.
There are now new ioctls (and defines for these) with an
additional '2' appended which provide the extended versions
with 256 cards supported.
