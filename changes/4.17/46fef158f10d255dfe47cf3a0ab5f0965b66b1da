KVM: arm/arm64: Fix idmap size and alignment

Although the idmap section of KVM can only be at most 4kB and
must be aligned on a 4kB boundary, the rest of the code expects
it to be page aligned. Things get messy when tearing down the
HYP page tables when PAGE_SIZE is 64K, and the idmap section isn't
64K aligned.

Let's fix this by computing aligned boundaries that the HYP code
will use.
