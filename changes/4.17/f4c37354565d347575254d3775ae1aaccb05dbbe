ARM: dts: aspeed: Add Palmetto GPIO hogs

These hogs are for parts of the system that need to be in this state,
but do not yet have a driver associated with them but they must be
configured in order to successfully boot the host.

There are also some pinmux hogs, where the default mode of the IP block
is configured.
