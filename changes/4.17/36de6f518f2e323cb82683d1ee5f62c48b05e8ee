libnvdimm, label: change min label storage size per UEFI 2.7

UEFI 2.7 defines in page 758 that:

  Initial Label Storage Area Configuration
     :
  The minimum size of the Label Storage Area is large enough to
  hold 2 index blocks and 2 labels.

The mininum index block size is 256 bytes, and the minimum label size
is also 256 bytes.

Change ND_LABEL_MIN_SIZE to (256 * 4) so that NVDIMM devices with
the minimum label storage area do not fail with the size check in
nvdimm_init_config_data().
