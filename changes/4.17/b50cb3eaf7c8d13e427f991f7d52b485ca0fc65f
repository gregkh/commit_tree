Documentation/i2c: sync docs with current state of i2c-tools

Currently, Documentation/i2c/dev-interface describes the use of
i2c_smbus_* helper routines as static inlined functions provided by
linux/i2c-dev.h.  Work has been done to refactor the linux/i2c-dev.h file
in the i2c-tools project out into its own library.  As a result, these
docs have become stale.

This patch corrects the discrepancy and directs the reader to the
i2c-tools project for more information.
