drm/i915/icl: new context descriptor support

Starting from Gen11 the context descriptor format has been updated in
the HW. The hw_id field has been considerably reduced in size and engine
class and instance fields have been added.

There is a slight name clashing issue because the field that we call
hw_id is actually called SW Context ID in the specs for Gen11+.

With the current size of the hw_id field we can have a maximum of 2k
contexts at any time, but we could use the sw_counter field (which is sw
defined) to increase that because the HW requirement is that
engine_id + sw id + sw_counter is a unique number.
GuC uses a similar method to support more contexts but does its tracking
at lrc level. To avoid doing an implementation that will need to be
reworked once GuC support lands, defer it for now and mark it as TODO.

v2: rebased, add documentation, fix GEN11_ENGINE_INSTANCE_SHIFT
v3: rebased, bring back lost code from i915_gem_context.c
v4: make TODO comment more generic
v5: be consistent with bit ordering, add extra checks (Chris)
