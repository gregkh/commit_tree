drm/i915/selftests: Tweak igt_ggtt_page to speed it up

Reduce the number of GGTT PTE operations to speed the test up, but we
reduce the likelihood of spotting a coherency error in those operations.
However, Broxton is sporadically timing on this test, presumably because
its GGTT operations are all uncached.
