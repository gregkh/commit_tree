media: ngene: add proper polling to the dvbdev_ci file ops

Implement the poll callback for the dvbdev_ci file ops. The ts_poll()
function queries the DVB ring buffers for available data and space, and
reports this as appropriate. Also, set the dvb_device readers, writers
and users to proper values (one reader, one writer, two users).

This fixes the raw CI TS transport in conjunction with TVheadend's
DDCI functionality.
