drm/i915: Stop kicking the signaling thread on seqno wraparound

Since commit fd10e2ce9905 ("drm/i915/breadcrumbs: Ignore unsubmitted
signalers"), we cancel the signaler when retiring the request and so
upon wraparound, where we wait for all requests to be retired, we no
longer need to spin waiting for the signaling thread to release its
references to the in-flight requests, and so we can assert that the
signaler is idle.
