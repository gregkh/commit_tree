kernel: use kernel_wait4() instead of sys_wait4()

All call sites of sys_wait4() set *rusage to NULL. Therefore, there is
no need for the copy_to_user() handling of *rusage, and we can use
kernel_wait4() directly.

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
