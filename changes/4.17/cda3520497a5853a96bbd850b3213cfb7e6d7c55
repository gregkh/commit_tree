staging: lustre: remove l_wait_event from ptlrpc_set_wait

This is the last remaining use of l_wait_event().
It is the only use of LWI_TIMEOUT_INTR_ALL() which
has a meaning that timeouts can be interrupted.
Only interrupts by "fatal" signals are allowed, so
introduce l_wait_event_abortable_timeout() to
support this.
