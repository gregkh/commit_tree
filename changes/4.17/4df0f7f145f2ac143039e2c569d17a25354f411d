xfs: fix transaction allocation deadlock in IO path

xfs_trans_alloc() does GFP_KERNEL allocation, and we can call it
while holding pages locked for writeback in the ->writepages path.
The memory allocation is allowed to wait on pages under writeback,
and so can wait on pages that are tagged as writeback by the
caller.

This affects both pre-IO submission and post-IO submission paths.
Hence xfs_setsize_trans_alloc(), xfs_reflink_end_cow(),
xfs_iomap_write_unwritten() and xfs_reflink_cancel_cow_range().
xfs_iomap_write_unwritten() already does the right thing, but the
others don't. Fix them.
