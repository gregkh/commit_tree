arm64: KVM: Move vector offsetting from hyp-init.S to kvm_get_hyp_vector

We currently provide the hyp-init code with a kernel VA, and expect
it to turn it into a HYP va by itself. As we're about to provide
the hypervisor with mappings that are not necessarily in the memory
range, let's move the kern_hyp_va macro to kvm_get_hyp_vector.

No functionnal change.
