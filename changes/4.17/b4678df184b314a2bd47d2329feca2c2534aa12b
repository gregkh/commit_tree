errseq: Always report a writeback error once

The errseq_t infrastructure assumes that errors which occurred before
the file descriptor was opened are of no interest to the application.
This turns out to be a regression for some applications, notably Postgres.

Before errseq_t, a writeback error would be reported exactly once (as
long as the inode remained in memory), so Postgres could open a file,
call fsync() and find out whether there had been a writeback error on
that file from another process.

This patch changes the errseq infrastructure to report errors to all
file descriptors which are opened after the error occurred, but before
it was reported to any file descriptor.  This restores the user-visible
behaviour.
