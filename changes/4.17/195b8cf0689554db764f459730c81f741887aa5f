proc: move "struct pde_opener" to kmem cache

"struct pde_opener" is fixed size and we can have more granular approach
to debugging.

For those who don't know, per cache SLUB poisoning and red zoning don't
work if there is at least one object allocated which is hopeless in case
of kmalloc-64 but not in case of standalone cache.  Although systemd
opens 2 files from the get go, so it is hopeless after all.
