phy: stm32: add support for STM32 USB PHY Controller (USBPHYC)

This patch adds phy transceiver driver for STM32 USB PHY Controller
(USBPHYC) that provides dual port High-Speed phy for OTG (single port)
and EHCI/OHCI host controller (two ports).
One port of the phy is shared between the two USB controllers through
a UTMI+ switch.
