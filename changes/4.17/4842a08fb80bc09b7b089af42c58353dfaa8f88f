sctp: init active key for the new asoc in dupcook_a and dupcook_b

When processing a duplicate cookie-echo chunk, for case 'A' and 'B',
after sctp_process_init for the new asoc, if auth is enabled for the
cookie-ack chunk, the active key should also be initialized.

Otherwise, the cookie-ack chunk made later can not be set with auth
shkey properly, and a crash can even be caused by this, as after
Commit 1b1e0bc99474 ("sctp: add refcnt support for sh_key"), sctp
needs to hold the shkey when making control chunks.

Fixes: 1b1e0bc99474 ("sctp: add refcnt support for sh_key")
