nvme/multipath: Fix multipath disabled naming collisions

When CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH is set, but we're not using nvme to multipath,
namespaces with multiple paths were not creating unique names due to
reusing the same instance number from the namespace's head.

This patch fixes this by falling back to the non-multipath naming method
when the parameter disabled using multipath.
