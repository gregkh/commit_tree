Report to the user area the TSO device capabilities, it includes the
max_tso size and the QP types that support it.

The TSO is applicable only when when of the ports is ETH and the device
supports it.

uresp logic around rss_caps is updated to fix a till-now harmless bug
computing the length of the structure to copy. The code did not handle the
implicit padding before rss_caps correctly. This is necessay to copy
tss_caps successfully.
