perf/x86/intel: Move regs->flags EXACT bit init

This patch removes a redundant store on regs->flags introduced
by commit:

  71eb9ee9596d ("perf/x86/intel: Fix linear IP of PEBS real_ip on Haswell and later CPUs")

We were clearing the PERF_EFLAGS_EXACT but it was overwritten by
regs->flags = pebs->flags later on.

The PERF_EFLAGS_EXACT is a software flag using bit 3 of regs->flags.
X86 marks this bit as Reserved. To make sure this bit is zero before
we do any IP processing, we clear it explicitly.

Patch also removes the following assignment:

	regs->flags = pebs->flags | (regs->flags & PERF_EFLAGS_VM);

Because there is no regs->flags to preserve anymore because
set_linear_ip() is not called until later.
