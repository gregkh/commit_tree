scsi: aacraid: Correct hba_send to include iu_type

commit b60710ec7d7a ("scsi: aacraid: enable sending of TMFs from
aac_hba_send()") allows aac_hba_send() to send scsi commands, and TMF
requests, but the existing code only updates the iu_type for scsi
commands. For TMF requests we are sending an unknown iu_type to
firmware, which causes a fault.

Include iu_type prior to determining the validity of the command
