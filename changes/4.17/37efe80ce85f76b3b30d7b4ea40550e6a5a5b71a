drm/vmwgfx: use monotonic event timestamps

DRM_VMW_EVENT_FENCE_SIGNALED (struct drm_vmw_event_fence) and
DRM_EVENT_VBLANK (struct drm_event_vblank) pass timestamps in 32-bit
seconds/microseconds format.

As of commit c61eef726a78 ("drm: add support for monotonic vblank
timestamps"), other DRM drivers use monotonic times for drm_event_vblank,
but vmwgfx still uses CLOCK_REALTIME for both events, which suffers from
the y2038/y2106 overflow as well as time jumps.

For consistency, this changes vmwgfx to use ktime_get_ts64 as well,
which solves those problems and avoids the deprecated do_gettimeofday()
function.

This should be transparent to to user space, as long as it doesn't
compare the time against the result of gettimeofday().
