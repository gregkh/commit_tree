IB/rxe: remove unnecessary skb_clone

In send_atomic_ack function, it is not necessary to make a
skb_clone. To gain better performance (high throughput and
low latency), this skb_clone is removed.

The following tests are made.

 server                       client
---------                    ---------
|1.1.1.1|<----rxe-channel--->|1.1.1.2|
---------                    ---------

On server: rping -s -a 1.1.1.1 -v -C 1000 -S 512
On client: rping -c -a 1.1.1.1 -v -C 1000 -S 512

The kernel config CONFIG_DEBUG_KMEMLEAK is enabled on both server
and client.

This test runs for several hours. There is no memory leak and the whole
system can work well.

Based on the above network, the following tests are made.

Server: ibv_rc_pingpong -d rxe0 -g 1
Client: ibv_rc_pingpong -d rxe0 -g 1 1.1.1.1

The test results on Server(10 tests are made).
Before:
Throughput is 137.07 Mbit/sec
Latency is 517.76 usec/iter

After:
Throughput is 148.85 Mbit/sec
Latency is 476.64 usec/iter

The throughput is enhanced and the latency is reduced.
