Input: atmel_mxt_ts - switch ChromeOS ACPI devices to generic props

Move older ChromeOS devices describing Atmel controllers in ACPI, but not
providing enough details to configure the controllers properly, from
platform data over to generic device properties. This will allow us
remove support for platform data later on, leaving only generic device
properties in place.
