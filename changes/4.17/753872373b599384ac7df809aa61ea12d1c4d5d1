clk: bcm2835: De-assert/assert PLL reset signal when appropriate

In order to enable a PLL, not only the PLL has to be powered up and
locked, but you also have to de-assert the reset signal. The last part
was missing. Add it so PLLs that were not enabled by the FW/bootloader
can be enabled from Linux.
