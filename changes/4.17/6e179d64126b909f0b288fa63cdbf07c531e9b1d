s390: add automatic detection of the spectre defense

Automatically decide between nobp vs. expolines if the spectre_v2=auto
kernel parameter is specified or CONFIG_EXPOLINE_AUTO=y is set.

The decision made at boot time due to CONFIG_EXPOLINE_AUTO=y being set
can be overruled with the nobp, nospec and spectre_v2 kernel parameters.
