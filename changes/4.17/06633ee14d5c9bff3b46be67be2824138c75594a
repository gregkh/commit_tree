Bluetooth: hci_ll: Replace mdelay with msleep in download_firmware

download_firmware() is never called from atomic context.

It is only called by ll_setup() that is called only via function pointer
"->setup" used in hci_uart_setup() in drivers/bluetooth/hci_serdev.c and
drivers/bluetooth/hci_ldisc.c. hci_uart_setup() is called only
via function pointer "->setup" used in hci_dev_do_open()
in net/bluetooth/hci_core.c.
All of the above functions do not enter atomic context.

Besides, ll_setup() calls msleep() and hci_dev_do_open calls mutex_lock().
So it indicates that all the above functions call functions that can sleep.

Despite never getting called from atomic context, download_firmware()
calls mdelay() for busy wait.
That is not necessary and can be replaced with msleep to avoid busy wait.

This is found by a static analysis tool named DCNS written by myself.
