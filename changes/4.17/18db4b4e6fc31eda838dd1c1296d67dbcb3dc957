ext4: don't allow r/w mounts if metadata blocks overlap the superblock

If some metadata block, such as an allocation bitmap, overlaps the
superblock, it's very likely that if the file system is mounted
read/write, the results will not be pretty.  So disallow r/w mounts
for file systems corrupted in this particular way.
