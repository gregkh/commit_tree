drm/bridge: sii902x: Retry status read after DDI I2C

The following happens when connection a DVI output driven
from the SiI9022 using a DVI-to-VGA adapter plug:

i2c i2c-0: sendbytes: NAK bailout.
i2c i2c-0: sendbytes: NAK bailout.

Then no picture. Apparently the I2C engine inside the SiI9022
is not smart enough to try to fall back to DDC I2C. Or the
vendor have not integrated the electronics properly. I don't
know which one it is.

After this, the I2C bus seems stalled and the first attempt to
read the status register fails, and the code returns with
negative return value, and the display fails to initialized.

Instead, retry status readout five times and continue even
if this fails.

Tested on the ARM Versatile Express with a DVI-to-VGA
connector, it now gives picture.

Introduce a helper struct device *dev variable to make
the code more readable.
