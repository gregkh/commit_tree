net/ncsi: Add generic netlink family

Add a generic netlink family for NCSI. This supports three commands;
NCSI_CMD_PKG_INFO which returns information on packages and their
associated channels, NCSI_CMD_SET_INTERFACE which allows a specific
package or package/channel combination to be set as the preferred
choice, and NCSI_CMD_CLEAR_INTERFACE which clears any preferred setting.
