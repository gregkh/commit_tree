net: sch: Don't warn on missmatching qlen and backlog for offloaded qdiscs

Offloaded qdiscs are allowed to expose only parts of their statistics.
It means that if backlog is being exposed and qlen is not, it might trigger
a warning in qdisc_tree_reduce_backlog.
Do not warn in case the qdisc that was removed was an offloaded one.
