mlxsw: Move a mirroring check to mlxsw_sp_span_entry_create

The check for whether a mirror port (which is a mlxsw front panel port)
belongs to the same mlxsw instance as the mirrored port, is currently
only done in spectrum_acl, even though it's applicable for the matchall
case as well. Thus move it to mlxsw_sp_span_entry_create().
