perf machine: Fix mmap name setup

Leo reported broken -k option behavior. The reason is that we used
symbol_conf.vmlinux_name as a source for mmap event name, but in fact
it's a vmlinux path.

Moving the symbol_conf.vmlinux_name check for both host and guest to the
proper place and out of the machine__set_mmap_name function.
