drm/i915/breadcrumbs: Drop request reference for the signaler thread

If we remember to cancel the signaler on a request when retiring it
(after we know that the request has been signaled), we do not need to
carry an additional request in the signaler itself. This prevents an
issue whereby the signaler threads may be delayed and hold on to
thousands of request references, causing severe memory fragmentation and
premature oom (most noticeable on 32b snb due to the limited GFP_KERNEL
and frequent use of inter-engine fences).

v2: Rename first_signal(), document reads outside of locks.
