staging: lustre: improve API and implementation of blocking signals.

According to comment for set_current_blocked() in
kernel/signal.c, changing ->blocked directly is wrong.
sigprocmask() should be called instead.

So change cfs_block_sigsinv() and cfs_restore_sigs()
to use sigprocmask().
For consistency, change them to pass the sigset_t by reference
rather than by value.

Also fix cfs_block_sigsinv() so that it correctly blocks
signals above 32 on a 32bit host.
