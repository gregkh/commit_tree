kexec: export PG_swapbacked to VMCOREINFO

Since commit 6326fec1122c ("mm: Use owner_priv bit for PageSwapCache,
valid when PageSwapBacked"), PG_swapcache is an alias for
PG_owner_priv_1, which may be also used for other purposes.

To know whether the bit indeed has the PG_swapcache meaning, it is
necessary to check PG_swapbacked, hence this bit must be exported.
