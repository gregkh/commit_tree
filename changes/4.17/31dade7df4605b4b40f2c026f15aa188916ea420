drm/i915: Ignore minimum lines for level 0 in skl_compute_plane_wm, v2.

According to bspec, result_lines > 31 is only a maximum for latency
level 1 through 7.

For level 0 the number of lines is ignored, so always write 0 there
to prevent overflowing the 5 bits value.

This is required to make NV12 work.

Changes since v1:
- Rebase on top of GEN11 wm changes. It seems to use res_lines for
  level 0 limit calculations, but still doesn't appear to program it.
