iwlwifi: mvm: query regdb for wmm rule if needed

Since our device is regulatory self managed it maintains its regulatory
rules by its own. However the wmm_rules values can't be set by the
device itself but only the indication about the need to set it.
In case the device set wmm indication, proactively query the regulatory
data base to get these values
