hwmon: (scmi) handle absence of few types of sensors

Currently the loop checks for non-zero count of sensors for each type
of sensors which is completely wrong. It also results in aborting the
registration of sensors if one or more types of sensors are completely
not supported by the platform SCMI firmware.

This patch fixes the issue by continue to loop and skiping sensor types
that are not present.
