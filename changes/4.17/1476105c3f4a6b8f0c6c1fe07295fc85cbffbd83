ASoC: fsl_ssi: Redefine RX and TX macros

The RX and TX macros were defined implicitly and there was
a potential risk if someone changes their values.

Since they were defined to index the array ssi->regvals[2],
this patch moves these two macros to fsl_ssi.c, closer to
its owner ssi->regvals. And it also puts some comments here
to limit their value within [0, 1].
