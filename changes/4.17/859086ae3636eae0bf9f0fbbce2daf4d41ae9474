media: uvcvideo: Apply flags from device to actual properties

Use flags the device exposes for UVC controls.
This allows the device to define which property flags are set.

Since some cameras offer auto-adjustments for properties (e.g. auto-gain),
the values of other properties (e.g. gain) can change in the camera.
Examining the flags ensures that the driver is aware of such properties.
