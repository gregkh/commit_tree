drm/i915/icl: Add initial Icelake definitions.

Icelake is an Intel® Processor containing an Intel® Graphics
Controller.

This is just an initial Icelake definition. PCI IDs, Icelake support
and new features coming in following patches.

v2: Add .ddb_size and .has_guc (Michal Wajdeczko).
v3: Add the ICL_FEATURES macro (Kelvin Gardiner).
v4 (from Paulo): Add missing __initconst (Paulo) and say "graphics
controller" instead of something that looks like an official marketing
name but isn't (Chris).
