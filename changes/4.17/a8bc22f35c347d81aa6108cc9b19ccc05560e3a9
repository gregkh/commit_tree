crypto: sahara - Improve a size determination in sahara_probe()

Replace the specification of a data structure by a pointer dereference
as the parameter for the operator "sizeof" to make the corresponding size
determination a bit safer according to the Linux coding style convention.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
