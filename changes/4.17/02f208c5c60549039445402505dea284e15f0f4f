cpufreq: scmi: add support for fast frequency switching

The cpufreq core provides option for drivers to implement fast_switch
callback which is invoked for frequency switching from interrupt context.

This patch adds support for fast_switch callback in SCMI cpufreq driver
by making use of polling based SCMI transfer. It also sets the flag
fast_switch_possible.
