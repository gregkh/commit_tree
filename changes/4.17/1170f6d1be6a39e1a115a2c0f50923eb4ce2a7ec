brcmfmac: do not convert linux error to firmware error string

In case of a linux error brcmf_fil_cmd_data() blurts an error message
in which the error code is translated to an error string. However, it
maps it to a firmware error string which should not happen. Simply
print only the numeric error code and be done with it.
