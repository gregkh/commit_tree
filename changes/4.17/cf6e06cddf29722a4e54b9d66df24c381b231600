usb: typec: Start using ERR_PTR

In order to allow the USB Type-C Class driver take care of
things like muxes and other possible dependencies for the
port drivers, returning ERR_PTR instead of NULL from the
registration functions in case of failure.

The reason for taking over control of the muxes for example
is because handling them in the port drivers would be just
boilerplate.
