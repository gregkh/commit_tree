ARM: sun9i: Support SMP bring-up on A80

The A80 is a big.LITTLE SoC with 1 cluster of 4 Cortex-A7s and
1 cluster of 4 Cortex-A15s.

This patch adds support to bring up the second cluster and thus all
cores using custom platform SMP code. Core/cluster power down has not
been implemented, thus CPU hotplugging is not supported.

Parts of the trampoline and re-entry code for the boot cpu was adapted
from the MCPM framework.
