kernel: add ksys_setsid() helper; remove in-kernel call to sys_setsid()

Using this helper allows us to avoid the in-kernel call to the
sys_setsid() syscall. The ksys_ prefix denotes that this function
is meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscall. In particular, it
uses the same calling convention as sys_setsid().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
