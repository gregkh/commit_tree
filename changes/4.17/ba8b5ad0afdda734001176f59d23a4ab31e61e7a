arm64: dts: renesas: r8a77965: Add #address-cells and #size-cells

Add "#address-cells" and "#size-cells" properties to all place-holder nodes
that have children nodes defined by salvator-x[s].dtsi device tree.

This silences the following DTC compiler warnings:
Warning (reg_format): "reg" property in /soc/.. has invalid length (4 bytes)
(#address-cells == 2, #size-cells == 1)
Warning (avoid_default_addr_size): Relying on default #address-cells
value for /soc/...
Warning (avoid_default_addr_size): Relying on default #size-cells value
for /soc/...
