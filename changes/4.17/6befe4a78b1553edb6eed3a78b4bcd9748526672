inet: frags: remove some helpers

Remove sum_frag_mem_limit(), ip_frag_mem() & ip6_frag_mem()

Also since we use rhashtable we can bring back the number of fragments
in "grep FRAG /proc/net/sockstat /proc/net/sockstat6" that was
removed in commit 434d305405ab ("inet: frag: don't account number
of fragment queues")
