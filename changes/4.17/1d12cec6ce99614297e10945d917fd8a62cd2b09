perf machine: Fix paranoid check in machine__set_kernel_mmap()

The machine__set_kernel_mmap() is to setup addresses of the kernel map
using external info.  But it has a check when the address is given from
an incorrect input which should have the start and end address of 0
(i.e. machine__process_kernel_mmap_event).

But we also use the end address of 0 for a valid input so change it to
check both start and end addresses.
