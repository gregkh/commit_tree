ALSA: aloop: Add missing cable lock to ctl API callbacks

Some control API callbacks in aloop driver are too lazy to take the
loopback->cable_lock and it results in possible races of cable access
while it's being freed.  It eventually lead to a UAF, as reported by
fuzzer recently.

This patch covers such control API callbacks and add the proper mutex
locks.
