kconfig: tests: check unneeded "is not set" with unmet dependency

Commit cb67ab2cd2b8 ("kconfig: do not write choice values when their
dependency becomes n") fixed a problem where "# CONFIG_... is not set"
for choice values are wrongly written into the .config file when they
are once visible, then become invisible later.

Add a test for this naive case.
