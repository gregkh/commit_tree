ipc: add semtimedop syscall/compat_syscall wrappers

Provide ksys_semtimedop() and compat_ksys_semtimedop() wrappers to avoid
in-kernel calls to these syscalls. The ksys_ prefix denotes that these
functions are meant as a drop-in replacement for the syscalls. In
particular, they use the same calling convention as sys_semtimedop() and
compat_sys_semtimedop().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
