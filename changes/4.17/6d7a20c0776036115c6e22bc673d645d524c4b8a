drm/etnaviv: replace hangcheck with scheduler timeout

This replaces the etnaviv internal hangcheck logic with the job timeout
handling provided by the DRM scheduler. This simplifies the driver further
and allows to replay jobs after a GPU reset, so only minimal state is lost.

This introduces a user-visible change in that we don't allow jobs to run
indefinitely as long as they make progress anymore, as this introduces
quality of service issues when multiple processes are using the GPU.
Userspace is now responsible to flush jobs in a way that the finish in a
reasonable time, where reasonable is currently defined as less than 500ms.
