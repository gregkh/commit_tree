kexec: call do_kexec_load() in compat syscall directly

do_kexec_load() can be called directly by compat_sys_kexec() as long as
the same parameters checks are completed which are currently handled
(also) by sys_kexec(). Therefore, move those to kexec_load_check(),
call that newly introduced helper function from both sys_kexec() and
compat_sys_kexec(), and duplicate the remaining code from sys_kexec()
in compat_sys_kexec().

This patch is part of a series which removes in-kernel calls to syscalls.
On this basis, the syscall entry path can be streamlined. For details, see
