mlxsw: spectrum_acl: Do not invalidate already invalid ACL groups

When a new ACL group is created its region (ACL) list is initially
empty. Thus, the call to mlxsw_sp_acl_tcam_group_update() would
basically invalidate an already invalid (non-existent) group.

Remove the unnecessary call and make the function symmetric to its del()
counterpart.
