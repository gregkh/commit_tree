rcu: Remove obsolete force-quiescent-state statistics for debugfs

The debugfs interface displayed statistics on RCU-pending checks but
this interface has since been removed.  This commit therefore removes the
no-longer-used rcu_state structure's ->n_force_qs_lh and ->n_force_qs_ngp
fields along with their updates.  (Though the ->n_force_qs_ngp field
was actually not used at all, embarrassingly enough.)

If this information proves necessary in the future, the corresponding
event traces will be added.
