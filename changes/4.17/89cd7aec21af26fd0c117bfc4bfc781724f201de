clk: mediatek: fix PWM clock source by adding a fixed-factor clock

The clock for which all PWM devices on MT7623 or MT2701 actually depending
on has to be divided by four from its parent clock axi_sel in the clock
path prior to PWM devices.

Consequently, adding a fixed-factor clock axisel_d4 as one-fourth of
clock axi_sel allows that PWM devices can have the correct resolution
calculation.
