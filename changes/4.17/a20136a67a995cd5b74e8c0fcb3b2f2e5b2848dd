ACPI: battery: do not export degraded capacity values over 100

With a degraded battery, full_charge_capacity can be less
than design_capacity, however it's not sure that capacity_now's
max will follow.

Example from an affected machine:
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_full        -> 4290000
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_full_design -> 5900000
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_now         -> 5900000
/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/capacity           -> 137

The battery is a degraded one with a full charge, and
charge_now is the value of charge_full_design instead of
charge_full.

Added a new quirk to test and correct this, and
a new function to check if the battery is a degraded one
or not. This keeps the possibility to be over 100 if
it's really the case.
