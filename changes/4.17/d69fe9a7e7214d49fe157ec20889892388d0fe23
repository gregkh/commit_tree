arm64: capabilities: Split the processing of errata work arounds

Right now we run through the errata workarounds check on all boot
active CPUs, with SCOPE_ALL. This wouldn't help for detecting erratum
workarounds with a SYSTEM_SCOPE. There are none yet, but we plan to
introduce some: let us clean this up so that such workarounds can be
detected and enabled correctly.

So, we run the checks with SCOPE_LOCAL_CPU on all CPUs and SCOPE_SYSTEM
checks are run only once after all the boot time CPUs are active.
