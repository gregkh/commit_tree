KVM: arm/arm64: Do not use kern_hyp_va() with kvm_vgic_global_state

kvm_vgic_global_state is part of the read-only section, and is
usually accessed using a PC-relative address generation (adrp + add).

It is thus useless to use kern_hyp_va() on it, and actively problematic
if kern_hyp_va() becomes non-idempotent. On the other hand, there is
no way that the compiler is going to guarantee that such access is
always PC relative.

So let's bite the bullet and provide our own accessor.
