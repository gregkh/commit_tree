scsi: aacraid: Implement DropIO sync command

IOP_RESET takes a long time to complete. If controller is in a state
where we can bring it back with init struct, send a DropIO sync command
instead.

 - If controller is faulted perform standard IOP_RESET in aac_srcv_init.

 - If controller is not faulted get adapter properties and extended
   properties.

 - Update the sa_firmware variable and determine if DropIO request is
   supported.

 - Issue DropIO request, and get the number of outstanding commands.

 - If all commands are complete with success (CT_OK), consider IOP_RESET
   is complete.

 - If any commands timeout, Perform the IOP_RESET.
