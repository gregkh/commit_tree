Bluetooth: hci_bcm: Do not tie GPIO pin order to a specific ACPI HID

Since I've been doing a lot of work on Linux Bay Trail / Cherry Trail
support, I've gathered a collection of ACPI DSDTs from about 50 such
machines.

Looking at these DSTDs many have an ACPI device entry describing a bcm
bluetooth device (often disabled in the DSDT), quite a few of these ACPI
device entries have a resource-table where the order does not match with
the order currently associated with the HID of that entry in the
bcm_acpi_match table.

Looking at the Windows .inf files, there is nothing indicating a specific
order there, so I believe that there is no 1:1 mapping between the ACPI
HID and the order in which the resources are listed.

Therefor this commit replaces the hardcoded mapping based on ACPI HID,
with code which actually checks in which order the resources are listed
and bases the gpio-mapping on that.

This should ensure that we always pick the right mapping and this will
make adding new ACPI HIDs to the driver easier.

This has been tested on the following devices:
-Asus T100CHI           BCM2E39 / brcmfmac43241b4-sdio / BCM4324B3-37.4M.hcd
-Asus T100TA            BCM2E39 / brcmfmac43241b4-sdio / BCM4324B3-37.4M.hcd
-Asus T200TA            BCM2E65 / brcmfmac43340-sdio   / BCM43341B0-37.4M.hcd
-Jumper ezPad mini 3    BCM2E74 / brcmfmac43430a0-sdio / BCM4343A0-26M.hcd
-Acer Iconia Tab8 w1-8  BCM2E83 / brcmfmac4330-sdio    / BCM4330B1-26M.hcd
-Chuwi Vi8 plus(CWI519) BCM2EAA / brcmfmac43430-sdio   / BCM43430A1-26M.hcd

Which together cover all 3 combinations of using an Interrupt resource /
GpioInt resource as first resource / GpioInt resource as last resource.
