scsi: qedi: fix building with LTO

When link-time optimizations are enabled, qedi fails to build because
of mismatched prototypes:

drivers/scsi/qedi/qedi_gbl.h:27:37: error: type of 'qedi_dbg_fops' does not match original declaration [-Werror=lto-type-mismatch]
 extern const struct file_operations qedi_dbg_fops;
                                     ^
drivers/scsi/qedi/qedi_debugfs.c:239:30: note: 'qedi_dbg_fops' was previously declared here
 const struct file_operations qedi_dbg_fops[] = {
                              ^
drivers/scsi/qedi/qedi_gbl.h:26:32: error: type of 'qedi_debugfs_ops' does not match original declaration [-Werror=lto-type-mismatch]
 extern struct qedi_debugfs_ops qedi_debugfs_ops;
                                ^
drivers/scsi/qedi/qedi_debugfs.c:102:25: note: 'qedi_debugfs_ops' was previously declared here
 struct qedi_debugfs_ops qedi_debugfs_ops[] = {

This changes the declaration to match the definition, and adapts the
users as necessary. Since both array can be constant here, I'm adding
the 'const' everywhere for consistency.
