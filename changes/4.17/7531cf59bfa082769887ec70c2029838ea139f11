iio: adc: stm32-dfsdm: fix successive oversampling settings

When doing successive oversampling settings, it may fail to update filter
parameters silently:
- First time oversampling is being set, it will be successful, as fl->res
is 0 initially.
- Next attempts with various oversamp value may return 0 (success), but
keep previous filter parameters, due to 'res' never reaches above or
equal current 'fl->res'.

This is particularly true when setting sampling frequency (that relies on
oversamp). Typical failure without error:
- run 1st test @16kHz samp freq will succeed
- run new test @8kHz will succeed as well
- run new test @16kHz (again): sample rate will remain 8kHz without error
