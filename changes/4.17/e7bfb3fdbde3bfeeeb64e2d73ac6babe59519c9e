mtd: Stop updating erase_info->state and calling mtd_erase_callback()

MTD users are no longer checking erase_info->state to determine if the
erase operation failed or succeeded. Moreover, mtd_erase_callback() is
now a NOP.

We can safely get rid of all mtd_erase_callback() calls and all
erase_info->state assignments. While at it, get rid of the
erase_info->state field, all MTD_ERASE_XXX definitions and the
mtd_erase_callback() function.
