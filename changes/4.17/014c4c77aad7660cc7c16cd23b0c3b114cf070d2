KVM: arm64: Improve debug register save/restore flow

Instead of having multiple calls from the world switch path to the debug
logic, each figuring out if the dirty bit is set and if we should
save/restore the debug registers, let's just provide two hooks to the
debug save/restore functionality, one for switching to the guest
context, and one for switching to the host context, and we get the
benefit of only having to evaluate the dirty flag once on each path,
plus we give the compiler some more room to inline some of this
functionality.
