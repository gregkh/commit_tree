perf mmap: Store mmap scope in struct perf_mmap()

There is too much boilerplate in the perf_mmap__read*() interfaces.

The 'start' and 'end' variables should be stored in struct perf_mmap at
initialization. They will be used later.

The old 'startp' and 'endp' pointers are used by perf_mmap__read_event()
now.  They cannot be removed. So the old 'startp/endp' and new
'md->start/md->end' will exist simultaneously now.  The old one will be
removed later.
