drm/modes: Kill off the oddball DRM_MODE_TYPE_CRTC_C vs. DRM_MODE_TYPE_BUILTIN handling

For some reason drm_mode_set_crtcinfo() does nothing if the mode has
the DRM_MODE_TYPE_BUILTIN flag set without the other bit from
DRM_MODE_TYPE_CRTC_C also set. I have zero idea what that is supposed
to achieve, but since we have no users for neither flag bit let's kill
this nonsense off.
