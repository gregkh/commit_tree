mm: disable interrupts while initializing deferred pages

Vlastimil Babka reported about a window issue during which when deferred
pages are initialized, and the current version of on-demand
initialization is finished, allocations may fail.  While this is highly
unlikely scenario, since this kind of allocation request must be large,
and must come from interrupt handler, we still want to cover it.

We solve this by initializing deferred pages with interrupts disabled,
and holding node_size_lock spin lock while pages in the node are being
initialized.  The on-demand deferred page initialization that comes
later will use the same lock, and thus synchronize with
deferred_init_memmap().

It is unlikely for threads that initialize deferred pages to be
interrupted.  They run soon after smp_init(), but before modules are
initialized, and long before user space programs.  This is why there is
no adverse effect of having these threads running with interrupts
disabled.
