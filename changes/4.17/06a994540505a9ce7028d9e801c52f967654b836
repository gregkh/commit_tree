ASoC: fsl_ssi: Rename fsl_ssi_disable_val macro

The define of fsl_ssi_disable_val is not so clear as it mixes two
steps of calculations together. And those parameter names are also
a bit long to read.

Since it just tries to exclude the shared bits from the regvals of
current stream while the opposite stream is active, it's better to
use something like ssi_excl_shared_bits.

This patch also bisects fsl_ssi_disable_val into two macros of two
corresponding steps and then shortens its parameter names. It also
updates callers in the fsl_ssi_config() accordingly.
