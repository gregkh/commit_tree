hwmon: (lm92) Do not try to detect MAX6635

Maxim MAX663x family are mostly compatible with LM92, but they lack any
identification register. Weakening the detect function would make it prone
to false positives, and current one doesn't detect all chips.  Therefore,
the detect function for max6635 devices is removed in favor of explicit
device instatiation.
