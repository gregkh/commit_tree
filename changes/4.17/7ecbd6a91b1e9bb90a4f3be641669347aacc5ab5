soc-core: don't call kfree() for component

When driver register its component to ALSA SoC, almost all drivers are
using snd_soc_register_component(), but soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm is
using snd_soc_add_component().

Existing component function had been assumed that registered component
was allocated, and it calling kfree() for it.
But, the user who used snd_soc_add_component() doesn't.

This patch uses devm_kzalloc() instead of kzalloc() for component,
and doesn't call kree() anymore.
This patch fixes commit be7ee5f32a9a ("ASoC: soc-generic-dmaengine-pcm:
replace platform to component").
Allwinner H3 SoC will crash without this patch.
Thanks Jernej report.
