x86/bugs/AMD: Add support to disable RDS on Fam[15,16,17]h if requested

AMD does not need the Speculative Store Bypass mitigation to be enabled.

The parameters for this are already available and can be done via MSR
C001_1020. Each family uses a different bit in that MSR for this.

[ tglx: Expose the bit mask via a variable and move the actual MSR fiddling
  	into the bugs code as that's the right thing to do and also required
	to prepare for dynamic enable/disable ]
