KVM: arm/arm64: Prepare to handle deferred save/restore of SPSR_EL1

SPSR_EL1 is not used by a VHE host kernel and can be deferred, but we
need to rework the accesses to this register to access the latest value
depending on whether or not guest system registers are loaded on the CPU
or only reside in memory.

The handling of accessing the various banked SPSRs for 32-bit VMs is a
bit clunky, but this will be improved in following patches which will
first prepare and subsequently implement deferred save/restore of the
32-bit registers, including the 32-bit SPSRs.
