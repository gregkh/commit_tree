ipmi/parisc: Add IPMI chassis poweroff for certain HP PA-RISC and IA-64 servers

This patch allows HP PA-RISC servers like rp3410/rp3440 and the HP C8000
workstation with an IPMI controller that predate IPMI 1.5 to use the standard
poweroff or powercycle commands.

These systems firmware don't set the chassis capability bit in the Get
Device ID, but they do implement the standard poweroff and powercycle
commands.
