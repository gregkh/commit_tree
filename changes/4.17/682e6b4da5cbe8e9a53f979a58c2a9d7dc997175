rtc: opal: Fix OPAL RTC driver OPAL_BUSY loops

The OPAL RTC driver does not sleep in case it gets OPAL_BUSY or
OPAL_BUSY_EVENT from firmware, which causes large scheduling
latencies, up to 50 seconds have been observed here when RTC stops
responding (BMC reboot can do it).

Fix this by converting it to the standard form OPAL_BUSY loop that
sleeps.
