serial: altera: ensure port->regshift is honored consistently

Most register accesses in the altera driver honor port->regshift by
using altera_uart_writel(). There are a few accesses however that were
missed when the driver was converted to use port->regshift and some
others were added later in commit 4d9d7d896d77 ("serial: altera_uart:
add earlycon support").
