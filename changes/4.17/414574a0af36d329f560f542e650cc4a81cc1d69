tipc: simplify interaction between subscription and topology connection

The message transmission and reception in the topology server is more
generic than is currently necessary. By basing the funtionality on the
fact that we only send items of type struct tipc_event and always
receive items of struct tipc_subcr we can make several simplifications,
and also get rid of some unnecessary dynamic memory allocations.
