iwlwifi: wrt: add fw force restart via triggers

We can set triggers that cause a debug data collection when something
of interest happens (e.g. when too many probes are lost conscutively).
Normally, this triggers don't cause the FW to be restarted, but in
some cases that may be desired, so we recover from the problem.  To
support this, add a flag that indicates that the FW should be
restarted when the trigger fires.
