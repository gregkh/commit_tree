ASoC: Intel: sst: Free streams on suspend, re-alloc on resume

The Bay Trail SST-DSP firmware version looses track of all streams over a
suspend/resume, failing any attempts to resume and/or free streams, with
a SST_ERR_INVALID_STREAM_ID error.

This commit adds support for free-ing the streams on suspend and
re-allocating them on resume, fixing suspend/resume issues on devices
using this firmware version.

This new behavior gets triggered by a new flag in sst_platform_info which
only gets set on Bay Trail platforms.

This has been tested on the following devices:
-Asus T100TA,    Bay Trail    + ALC5642 codec
-Ployer MOMO7W,  Bay Trail CR + ALC5652 codec
