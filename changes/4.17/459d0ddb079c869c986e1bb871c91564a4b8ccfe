nfit, address-range-scrub: determine one platform max_ars value

acpi_nfit_query_poison() is awkward in that it requires an nfit_spa
argument in order to determine what max_ars value to use. Instead probe
for the minimum max_ars across all scrub-capable ranges in the system
and drop the nfit_spa argument.

This enables a larger rework / simplification of the ARS state machine
whereby the status can be retrieved once and then iterated over all
address ranges to reap completions.
