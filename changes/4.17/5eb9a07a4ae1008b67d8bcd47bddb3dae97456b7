spi: bcm-qspi: Avoid setting MSPI_CDRAM_PCS for spi-nor master

Added fix for probing of spi-nor device non-zero chip selects. Set
MSPI_CDRAM_PCS (peripheral chip select) with spi master for MSPI
controller and not for MSPI/BSPI spi-nor master controller. Ensure
setting of cs bit in chip select register on chip select change.
