net: mvneta: improve suspend/resume

Current suspend/resume implementation reuses the mvneta_open() and
mvneta_close(), but it could be optimized to take only necessary
actions during suspend/resume.

One obvious problem of current implementation is: after hundreds of
system suspend/resume cycles, the resume of mvneta could fail due to
fragmented dma coherent memory. After this patch, the non-necessary
memory alloc/free is optimized out.
