ASoC: Use proper DT compatible string for Hardkernel Odroid boards

The Odroid boards are manufactured by Hardkernel, not Samsung. New compatible
string entries are added, with "hardkernel," instead of "samsung," vendor
prefix. Support for the old compatible strings is going to be removed after
some time.
