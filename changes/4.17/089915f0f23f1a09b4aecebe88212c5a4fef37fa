i40e: restore TCPv4 input set when re-enabling ATR

When we re-enable ATR we need to restore the input set for TCPv4
filters, in order for ATR to function correctly. We already do this for
the normal case of re-enabling ATR when disabling ntuple support.
However, when re-enabling ATR after the last TCPv4 filter is removed (but
when ntuple support is still active), we did not restore the TCPv4
filter input set.

This can cause problems if the TCPv4 filters from FDir had changed the
input set, as ATR will no longer behave as expected.

When clearing the ATR auto-disable flag, make sure we restore the TCPv4
input set to avoid this.
