s390/decompressor: discard __ex_table section

Exception table (__ex_table section) is not used during the decompressor
phase and could be discarded to save the memory. It is currently
generated due to sclp_service_call function (sclp_early_core.c). An
assumption is that decompressor usage of sclp_service_call via
sclp_early_printk should never trigger exceptions.
