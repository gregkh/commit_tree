ALSA: hda/realtek - Add some fixes for ALC233

Fill COEF to change EAPD to verb control.
Assigned codec type.

This is an additional fix over 92f974df3460 ("ALSA: hda/realtek - New
vendor ID for ALC233").

[ More notes:
  according to Kailang, the chip is 10ec:0235 bonding for ALC233b,
  which is equivalent with ALC255.  It's only used for Lenovo.
  The chip needs no alc_process_coef_fw() for headset unlike ALC255. ]
