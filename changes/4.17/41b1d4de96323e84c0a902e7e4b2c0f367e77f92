i2c: xlp9xx: Handle transactions with I2C_M_RECV_LEN properly

In case of transaction with I2C_M_RECV_LEN set, make sure the driver reads
the first byte and then updates the RX fifo with the expected length. Set
threshold to 1 byte so that driver gets an interrupt on receiving the first byte.
After which the transfer length is updated depending on the received length.
Also report SMBus block read functionality.
