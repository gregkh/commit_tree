ipv6: add a wrapper for ip6_dst_store() with flowi6 checks

Move commonly used pattern of ip6_dst_store() usage to a separate
function - ip6_sk_dst_store_flow(), which will check the addresses
for equality using the flow information, before saving them.

There is no functional changes in this patch. In addition, it will
be used in the next patch, in ip6_sk_dst_lookup_flow().
