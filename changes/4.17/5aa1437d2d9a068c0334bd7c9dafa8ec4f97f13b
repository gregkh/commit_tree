ext2: fix a block leak

open file, unlink it, then use ioctl(2) to make it immutable or
append only.  Now close it and watch the blocks *not* freed...

Immutable/append-only checks belong in ->setattr().
Note: the bug is old and backport to anything prior to 737f2e93b972
("ext2: convert to use the new truncate convention") will need
these checks lifted into ext2_setattr().
