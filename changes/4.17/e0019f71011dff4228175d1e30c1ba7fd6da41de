media: i2c: adv748x: Fix cleanup jump on chip identification

The error handling for the adv748x_identify_chip() call erroneously
jumps to the err_cleanup_clients label before the clients have been
established.

Correct this by jumping to the next (and correct) label in the cleanup
code: err_cleanup_dt.
