KVM: x86: Add support for VMware backdoor Pseudo-PMCs

VMware exposes the following Pseudo PMCs:
0x10000: Physical host TSC
0x10001: Elapsed real time in ns
0x10002: Elapsed apparent time in ns

For more info refer to:
https://www.vmware.com/files/pdf/techpaper/Timekeeping-In-VirtualMachines.pdf

VMware allows access to these Pseduo-PMCs even when read via RDPMC
in Ring3 and CR4.PCE=0. Therefore, commit modifies x86 emulator
to allow access to these PMCs in this situation. In addition,
emulation of these PMCs were added to kvm_pmu_rdpmc().
