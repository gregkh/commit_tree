drm/vmwgfx: Avoid pinning fbdev framebuffers

fbdev framebuffers were previously pinned to be able to keep them mapped
across updates.

This commit introduces a mechanism that instead revalidates the map on
each update, keeping the map cached across updates. The cached map is torn
down if the underlying pages change. Typically on buffer object moves and
swapouts.

This should be nicer to the system when we have resource contention.

Testing done: Basic fbdev functionality under Fedora 27.
