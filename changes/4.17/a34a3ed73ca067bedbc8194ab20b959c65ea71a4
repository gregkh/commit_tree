iio: dummy: Add correct tabs and spaces to Kconfig

Kconfig from iio/dummy does not follow the coding style recommendations.
According to the coding-style, Lines under a config definition are
indented with one tab, while help text is indented an additional two
spaces. This patch adds the proper tabulation and space.
