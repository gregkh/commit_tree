mlxsw: spectrum_span: Support mirror to gretap

When a user requests mirror from a mlxsw physical port (possibly based
on an ACL match) to a gretap netdevice, the driver needs to resolve the
request to a particular physical port that the mirrored packets will
egress through, and a suite of configuration keys (importantly, IP and
MAC addresses). That means calling into routing and neighbor kernel code
to simulate the decisions made by the system for packets passing through
a gretap netdevice.

Add a new instance of mlxsw_sp_span_entry_ops to support this.
