MIPS: ptrace: Fix PTRACE_PEEKUSR requests for 64-bit FGRs

Use 64-bit accesses for 64-bit floating-point general registers with
PTRACE_PEEKUSR, removing the truncation of their upper halves in the
FR=1 mode, caused by commit bbd426f542cb ("MIPS: Simplify FP context
access"), which inadvertently switched them to using 32-bit accesses.

The PTRACE_POKEUSR side is fine as it's never been broken and continues
using 64-bit accesses.
