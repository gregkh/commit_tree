btrfs: Remove invalid null checks from btrfs_cleanup_dirty_bgs

list_first_entry is essentially a wrapper over cotnainer_of. The latter
can never return null even if it's working on inconsistent list since it
will either crash or return some offset in the wrong struct.
Additionally, for the dirty_bgs list the iteration is done under
dirty_bgs_lock which ensures consistency of the list.
