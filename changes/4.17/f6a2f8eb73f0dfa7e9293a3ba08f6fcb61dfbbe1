fsi: Match fsi slaves and engines to available dt nodes

This change populates device tree nodes for scanned FSI slaves and
engines. If the master populates ->of_node of the FSI master device,
we'll look for matching slaves, and under those slaves we'll look for
matching engines.

This means that FSI drivers will have their ->of_node pointer populated
if there's a corresponding DT node, which they can use for further
device discover.

Presence of device tree nodes is optional, and only required for
fsi device drivers that need extra properties, or subordinate devices,
to be enumerated.
