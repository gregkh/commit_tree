Input: synaptics - Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon G5 (2017) with Elantech trackpoints should use RMI

Lenovo use two different trackpoints in the fifth generation Thinkpad X1
Carbon. Both are accessible over SMBUS/RMI but the pnpIDs are missing.
This patch is for the Elantech trackpoint specifically which also
reports SMB version 3 so rmi_smbus needs to be updated in order to
handle it.

For the record, I was not the first one to come up with this patch as it
has been floating around the internet for a while now. However, I have
spent significant time with testing and my efforts to find the original
author of the patch have been unsuccessful.
