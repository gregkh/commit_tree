serial: altera: set RRDY flag also without irq

The UART can be operated without an irq. In this case a timer is setup
that regularily calls altera_uart_interrupt(). The receiving part
depends on pp->imr having the bit ALTERA_UART_STATUS_RRDY_MSK set,
otherwise altera_uart_rx_chars() is never called. So ensure that the bit
gets set (disguised as ALTERA_UART_CONTROL_RRDY_MSK) by not returning
early from altera_uart_startup() if port->irq is 0.

This doesn't affect the hardware as the ALTERA_UART_CONTROL_RRDY_MSK bit
isn't actually written to the control register.
