x86/msr: Make rdmsrl_safe_on_cpu() scheduling safe as well

When changing rdmsr_safe_on_cpu() to schedule, it was missed that
__rdmsr_safe_on_cpu() was also used by rdmsrl_safe_on_cpu()

Make rdmsrl_safe_on_cpu() a wrapper instead of copy/pasting the code which
was added for the completion handling.
