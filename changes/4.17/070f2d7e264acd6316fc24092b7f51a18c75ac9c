net: Drop NETDEV_UNREGISTER_FINAL

Last user is gone after bdf5bd7f2132 "rds: tcp: remove
register_netdevice_notifier infrastructure.", so we can
remove this netdevice command. This allows to delete
rtnl_lock() in netdev_run_todo(), which is hot path for
net namespace unregistration.

dev_change_net_namespace() and netdev_wait_allrefs()
have rcu_barrier() before NETDEV_UNREGISTER_FINAL call,
and the source commits say they were introduced to
delemit the call with NETDEV_UNREGISTER, but this patch
leaves them on the places, since they require additional
analysis, whether we need in them for something else.
