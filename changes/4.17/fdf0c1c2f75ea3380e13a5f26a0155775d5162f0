drm/amd/display: Add logging for aux DPCD access

Add basic logging for DPCD access. Does not print
by default.

Currently only prints first byte of the data accessed.

Technical debt: Need to make it so that the entire
data block accessed is printed. Also need to log
address space that's not DPCD.
