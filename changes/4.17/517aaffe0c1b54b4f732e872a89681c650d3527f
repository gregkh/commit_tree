drm/i915/execlists: Inhibit context save/restore for the fake preempt context

We only use the preempt context to inject an idle point into execlists.
We never need to reference its logical state, so tell the GPU never to
load it or save it.

v2: BIT(2) for save-inhibit.

N.B. Daniele mentioned this bit mbz for ICL, and has been moved into the
submission process rather than the context image.
