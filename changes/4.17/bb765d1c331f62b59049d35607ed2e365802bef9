tee: shm: fix use-after-free via temporarily dropped reference

Bump the file's refcount before moving the reference into the fd table,
not afterwards. The old code could drop the file's refcount to zero for a
short moment before calling get_file() via get_dma_buf().

This code can only be triggered on ARM systems that use Linaro's OP-TEE.
