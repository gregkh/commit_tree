net: hns3: Add support to re-initialize the hclge device

After the hardware reset we should re-fetch the configuration from
PF like queue info and tc info. This might have impact on allocations
made like that of TQPs. Hence, we should release all such allocations
and re-allocate fresh according to new fetched configuration after
reset.
