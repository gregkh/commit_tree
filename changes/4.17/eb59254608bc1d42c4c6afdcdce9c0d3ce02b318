mm: introduce NR_INDIRECTLY_RECLAIMABLE_BYTES

Patch series "indirectly reclaimable memory", v2.

This patchset introduces the concept of indirectly reclaimable memory
and applies it to fix the issue of when a big number of dentries with
external names can significantly affect the MemAvailable value.

This patch (of 3):

Introduce a concept of indirectly reclaimable memory and adds the
corresponding memory counter and /proc/vmstat item.

Indirectly reclaimable memory is any sort of memory, used by the kernel
(except of reclaimable slabs), which is actually reclaimable, i.e.  will
be released under memory pressure.

The counter is in bytes, as it's not always possible to count such
objects in pages.  The name contains BYTES by analogy to
NR_KERNEL_STACK_KB.
