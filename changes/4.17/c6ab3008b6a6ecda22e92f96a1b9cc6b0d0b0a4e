net: phy: phylink: Provide PHY interface to mac_link_{up, down}

In preparation for having DSA transition entirely to PHYLINK, we need to pass a
PHY interface type to the mac_link_{up,down} callbacks because we may have to
make decisions on that (e.g: turn on/off RGMII interfaces etc.). We do not pass
an entire phylink_link_state because not all parameters (pause, duplex etc.) are
defined when the link is down, only link and interface are.

Update mvneta accordingly since it currently implements phylink_mac_ops.
