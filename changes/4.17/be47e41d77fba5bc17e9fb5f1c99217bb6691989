tipc: fix use-after-free in tipc_nametbl_stop

When we delete a service item in tipc_nametbl_stop() we loop over
all service ranges in the service's RB tree, and for each service
range we loop over its pertaining publications while calling
tipc_service_remove_publ() for each of them.

However, tipc_service_remove_publ() has the side effect that it also
removes the comprising service range item when there are no publications
left. This leads to a "use-after-free" access when the inner loop
continues to the next iteration, since the range item holding the list
we are looping no longer exists.

We fix this by moving the delete of the service range item outside
the said function. Instead, we now let the two functions calling it
test if the list is empty and perform the removal when that is the
case.
