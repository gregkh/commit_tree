fm10k: fix incorrect warning for function prototype

Recent kernels now complain about incorrect function prototype comments,
in order to ensure comments are accurate to the function. However, it
incorrectly associates the comment above the fm10k_pci_tbl[] as
a function header comment. Fix this by removing the extra "*" in the
comment. This normally indicates that the function is a doxygen style
function header comment.

Once removed, the logic no longer kicks in and the following warning is
fixed:

  warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'const struct pci_device_id fm10k_pci_tbl[] = '
