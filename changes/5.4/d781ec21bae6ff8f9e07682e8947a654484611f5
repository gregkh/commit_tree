serial: tegra: report clk rate errors

Standard UART controllers support +/-4% baud rate error tolerance.
Tegra186 only supports 0% to +4% error tolerance whereas other Tegra
chips support standard +/-4% rate. Add chip data for knowing error
tolerance level for each soc. Creating new compatible for Tegra194
chip as it supports baud rate error tolerance of -2 to +2%, different
from older chips.
