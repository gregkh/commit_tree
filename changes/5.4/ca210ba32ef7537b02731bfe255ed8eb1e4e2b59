scripts/gdb: fix lx-dmesg when CONFIG_PRINTK_CALLER is set

When CONFIG_PRINTK_CALLER is set, struct printk_log contains an
additional member caller_id.  This affects the offset of the log text.
Account for this by using the type information from gdb to determine all
the offsets instead of using hardcoded values.

This fixes following error:

  (gdb) lx-dmesg
  Python Exception <class 'ValueError'> embedded null character:
  Error occurred in Python command: embedded null character

The read_u* utility functions now take an offset argument to make them
easier to use.
