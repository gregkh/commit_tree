fs, fscrypt: move uapi definitions to new header <linux/fscrypt.h>

More fscrypt definitions are being added, and we shouldn't use a
disproportionate amount of space in <linux/fs.h> for fscrypt stuff.
So move the fscrypt definitions to a new header <linux/fscrypt.h>.

For source compatibility with existing userspace programs, <linux/fs.h>
still includes the new header.
