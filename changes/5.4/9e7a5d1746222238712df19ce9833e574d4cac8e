ice: Fix ethtool port and PFC stats for 4x25G cards

This patch fixes the issue where port and PFC statistics counters are
incrementing at the wrong port with 4x25G cards.
Read the GLPRT port registers using lport parameter instead of pf_id to
update the statistics otherwise the pf_ids are flipped for ports 2 and 3
when read from the HW register PF_FUNC_RID and this is expected as per
hardware specification.
