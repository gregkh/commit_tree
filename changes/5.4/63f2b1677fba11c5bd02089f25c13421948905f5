staging/fbtft: Depend on OF

Commit c440eee1a7a1 ("Staging: fbtft: Switch to the gpio descriptor
interface") removed setting gpios via platform data. This means that
fbtft will now only work with Device Tree so set the dependency.

This also prevents a NULL pointer deref on non-DT platform because
fbtftops.request_gpios is not set in that case anymore.
