mm/hmm: only define hmm_vma_walk_pud if needed

We only need the special pud_entry walker if PUD-sized hugepages and pte
mappings are supported, else the common pagewalk code will take care of
the iteration.  Not implementing this callback reduced the amount of code
compiled for non-x86 platforms, and also fixes compile failures with other
architectures when helpers like pud_pfn are not implemented.
