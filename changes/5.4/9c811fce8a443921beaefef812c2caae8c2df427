drm/i915/icl: Add new supported CD clocks

Now 180, 172.8 and 192 MHz are supported.

180 and 172.8 MHz CD clocks will only be used when audio is not
enabled as state by BSpec and implemented in
intel_crtc_compute_min_cdclk(), CD clock must be at least twice of
Azalia BCLK and BCLK by default is 96 MHz, it could be set to 48 MHz
but we are not reading it.

v3:
- making icl clock arrays static (Ville)

BSpec: 20598
BSpec: 15729
