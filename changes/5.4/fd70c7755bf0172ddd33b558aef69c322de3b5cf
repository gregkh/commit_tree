drm/bridge: tc358767: fix max_tu_symbol value

max_tu_symbol was programmed to TU_SIZE_RECOMMENDED - 1, which is not
what the spec says. The spec says:

roundup ((input active video bandwidth in bytes/output active video
bandwidth in bytes) * tu_size)

It is not quite clear what the above means, but calculating
max_tu_symbol = (input Bps / output Bps) * tu_size seems to work and
fixes the issues seen.

This fixes artifacts in some videomodes (e.g. 1024x768@60 on 2-lanes &
1.62Gbps was pretty bad for me).
