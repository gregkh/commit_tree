coresight: tmc-etr: Fix perf_data check

When tracing etm data of multiple threads on multiple cpus through
perf interface, each cpu has a unique etr_perf_buffer while sharing
the same etr device. There is no guarantee that the last cpu starts
etm tracing also stops last. This makes perf_data check fail.

Fix it by checking etr_buf instead of etr_perf_buffer.
Also move the code setting and clearing perf_buf to more suitable
places.
