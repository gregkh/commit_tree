perf intel-pt: Use shared x86 insn decoder

Now that there's a common version of the decoder for all tools, use it
instead of the local copy.

Also use perf's check-headers.sh script to diff the decoder files to
make sure they remain in sync with the kernel version.  Objtool has a
similar check.

Committer notes:

Had to keep this all pointing explicitely to x86 headers/files, i.e.
instead of asm/isnn.h we had to use ../include/asm/insn.h when the files
were in differemt dirs, or just replace "<asm/foo.h>" with "foo.h".

This way we continue to be able to process perf.data files with Intel PT
traces in distros other than x86.

Also fixed up the awk script paths to use $(srcdir)/tools/arch instead
or relative directories so that we keep detached tarballs (make help |
grep perf) working.

For now the include lines in these headers are being ignored so as not
to flag false reports of kernel/tools out of sync.
