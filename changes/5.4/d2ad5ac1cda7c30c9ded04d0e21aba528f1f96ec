fpga: dfl: afu: add AFU state related sysfs interfaces

This patch introduces more sysfs interfaces for Accelerated
Function Unit (AFU). These interfaces allow users to read
current AFU Power State (APx), read / clear AFU Power (APx)
events which are sticky to identify transient APx state,
and manage AFU's LTR (latency tolerance reporting).
