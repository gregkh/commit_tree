crypto: inside-secure - add support for using the EIP197 without vendor firmware

Until now, the inside-secure driver required a set of firmware images
supplied by the silicon vendor, typically under NDA, to be present in
/lib/firmware/inside-secure in order to be able to function.
This patch removes the dependence on this official vendor firmware by
falling back to generic "mini" FW - developed specifically for this
driver - that can be provided under GPL 2.0 through linux-firmwares.
