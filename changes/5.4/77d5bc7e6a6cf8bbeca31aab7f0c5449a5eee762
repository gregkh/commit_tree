ipv4: Revert removal of rt_uses_gateway

Julian noted that rt_uses_gateway has a more subtle use than 'is gateway
set':

Revert that part of the commit referenced in the Fixes tag.

Currently, there are no u8 holes in 'struct rtable'. There is a 4-byte hole
in the second cacheline which contains the gateway declaration. So move
rt_gw_family down to the gateway declarations since they are always used
together, and then re-use that u8 for rt_uses_gateway. End result is that
rtable size is unchanged.
