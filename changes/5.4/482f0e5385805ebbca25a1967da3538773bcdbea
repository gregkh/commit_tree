drm/amdgpu: fix double ucode load by PSP(v3)

previously the ucode loading of PSP was repreated, one executed in
phase_1 init/re-init/resume and the other in fw_loading routine

Avoid this double loading by clearing ip_blocks.status.hw in suspend or reset
prior to the FW loading and any block's hw_init/resume

v2:
still do the smu fw loading since it is needed by bare-metal

v3:
drop the change in reinit_early_sriov, just clear all block's status.hw
in the head place and set the status.hw after hw_init done is enough
