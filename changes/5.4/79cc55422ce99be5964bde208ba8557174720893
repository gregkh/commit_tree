NFS: Fix an RCU lock leak in nfs4_refresh_delegation_stateid()

A typo in nfs4_refresh_delegation_stateid() means we're leaking an
RCU lock, and always returning a value of 'false'. As the function
description states, we were always supposed to return 'true' if a
matching delegation was found.

Fixes: 12f275cdd163 ("NFSv4: Retry CLOSE and DELEGRETURN on NFS4ERR_OLD_STATEID.")
