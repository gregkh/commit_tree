selftests/bpf: add test for bpf_tcp_gen_syncookie

Modify the existing bpf_tcp_check_syncookie test to also generate a
SYN cookie, pass the packet to the kernel, and verify that the two
cookies are the same (and both valid). Since cloned SKBs are skipped
during generic XDP, this test does not issue a SYN cookie when run in
XDP mode. We therefore only check that a valid SYN cookie was issued at
the TC hook.

Additionally, verify that the MSS for that SYN cookie is within
expected range.
