rcu/nocb: Use build-time no-CBs check in rcu_pending()

Currently, rcu_pending() invokes rcu_segcblist_is_offloaded() even
in CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=n kernels, which cannot possibly be offloaded.
Given that rcu_pending() is on a fastpath, it makes sense to check for
CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=y before invoking rcu_segcblist_is_offloaded().
This commit therefore makes this change.
