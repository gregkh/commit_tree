tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: Drop unnecessary uart_write_wakeup()

Uart_write_wakeup() will already be called as a part of
lpuart*_transmit_buffer() call, so there doesn't seem to be a reason
to call it again right after.

It also appears that second uart_write_wakeup() might potentially
cause unwanted write wakeup when transmitting an x_char. See commit
5e42e9a30cda ("serial: imx: Fix x_char handling and tx flow control")
where this problem was fixed in a very similarly structured i.MX UART
driver.
