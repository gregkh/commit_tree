net: bcmgenet: reapply manual settings to the PHY

The phy_init_hw() function may reset the PHY to a configuration
that does not match manual network settings stored in the phydev
structure. If the phy state machine is polled rather than event
driven this can create a timing hazard where the phy state machine
might alter the settings stored in the phydev structure from the
value read from the BMCR.

This commit follows invocations of phy_init_hw() by the bcmgenet
driver with invocations of the genphy_config_aneg() function to
ensure that the BMCR is written to match the settings held in the
phydev structure. This prevents the risk of manual settings being
accidentally altered.
