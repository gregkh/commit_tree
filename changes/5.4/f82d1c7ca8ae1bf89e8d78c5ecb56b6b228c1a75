btrfs: tree-checker: Add EXTENT_ITEM and METADATA_ITEM check

This patch introduces the ability to check extent items.

This check involves:
- key->objectid check
  Basic alignment check.

- key->type check
  Against btrfs_extent_item::type and SKINNY_METADATA feature.

- key->offset alignment check for EXTENT_ITEM

- key->offset check for METADATA_ITEM

- item size check
  Both against minimal size and stepping check.

- btrfs_extent_item check
  Checks its flags and generation.

- btrfs_extent_inline_ref checks
  Against 4 types inline ref.
  Checks bytenr alignment and tree level.

- btrfs_extent_item::refs check
  Check against total refs found in inline refs.

This check would be the most complex single item check due to its nature
of inlined items.
