pinctrl-mcp23s08: Fix property-name in dt-example

The device-tree properties documentation-file specifies the property
"microchip,spi-present-mask" as required for MCP23SXX chips. However,
the device-tree-source example below it uses only "spi-present-mask".
Without "microchip," on the front, the driver will print "missing
spi-present-mask" when it initializes.

Update the device-tree example with the correct property-name.
