net: ag71xx: fix mdio subnode support

This patch is syncing driver with actual devicetree documentation:
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/net/qca,ar71xx.txt
|Optional subnodes:
|- mdio : specifies the mdio bus, used as a container for phy nodes
|  according to phy.txt in the same directory

The driver was working with fixed phy without any noticeable issues. This bug
was uncovered by introducing dsa ar9331-switch driver.
Since no one reported this bug until now, I assume no body is using it
and this patch should not brake existing system.
