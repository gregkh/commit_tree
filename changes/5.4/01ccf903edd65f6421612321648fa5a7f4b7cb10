pwm: Let pwm_get_state() return the last implemented state

When pwm_apply_state() is called the lowlevel driver usually has to
apply some rounding because the hardware doesn't support nanosecond
resolution. So let pwm_get_state() return the actually implemented state
instead of the last applied one if possible.
