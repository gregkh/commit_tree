s390/qeth: add xmit_more support for IQD devices

IQD devices offer limited support for bulking: all frames in a TX buffer
need to have the same target. qeth_iqd_may_bulk() implements this
constraint, and allows us to defer the TX doorbell until
(a) the buffer is full (since each buffer needs its own doorbell), or
(b) the entire TX queue is full, or
(b) we reached the BQL limit.
