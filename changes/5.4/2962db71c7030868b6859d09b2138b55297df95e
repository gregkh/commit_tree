staging/fbtft: Remove fbtft_device

Commit c440eee1a7a1 ("Staging: fbtft: Switch to the gpio descriptor
interface") removed the gpio code from fbtft_device rendering it useless.

fbtft_device is a module that was used on the Raspberry Pi to dynamically
add fbtft devices when the Pi didn't have Device Tree support.
Just remove the module since it's the responsibility of Device Tree, ACPI
or platform code to add devices.
