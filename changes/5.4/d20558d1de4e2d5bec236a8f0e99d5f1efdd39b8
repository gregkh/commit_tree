docs: kbuild: remove cc-ldoption from document again

Commit 055efab3120b ("kbuild: drop support for cc-ldoption") correctly
removed the cc-ldoption from Documentation/kbuild/makefiles.txt, but
commit cd238effefa2 ("docs: kbuild: convert docs to ReST and rename
to *.rst") revived it. I guess it was a rebase mistake.

Remove it again.
