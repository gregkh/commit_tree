x86/apic: Remove dest argument from __default_send_IPI_shortcut()

The SDM states:

  "The destination shorthand field of the ICR allows the delivery mode to be
   by-passed in favor of broadcasting the IPI to all the processors on the
   system bus and/or back to itself (see Section 10.6.1, Interrupt Command
   Register (ICR)). Three destination shorthands are supported: self, all
   excluding self, and all including self. The destination mode is ignored
   when a destination shorthand is used."

So there is no point to supply the destination mode to the shorthand
delivery function.
