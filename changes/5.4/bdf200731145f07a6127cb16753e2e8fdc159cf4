io_uring: use __kernel_timespec in timeout ABI

All system calls use struct __kernel_timespec instead of the old struct
timespec, but this one was just added with the old-style ABI. Change it
now to enforce the use of __kernel_timespec, avoiding ABI confusion and
the need for compat handlers on 32-bit architectures.

Any user space caller will have to use __kernel_timespec now, but this
is unambiguous and works for any C library regardless of the time_t
definition. A nicer way to specify the timeout would have been a less
ambiguous 64-bit nanosecond value, but I suppose it's too late now to
change that as this would impact both 32-bit and 64-bit users.
