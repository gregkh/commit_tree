KVM: x86: Exit to userspace on emulation skip failure

Kill a few birds with one stone by forcing an exit to userspace on skip
emulation failure.  This removes a reference to EMULATE_FAIL, fixes a
bug in handle_ept_misconfig() where it would exit to userspace without
setting run->exit_reason, and fixes a theoretical bug in SVM's
task_switch_interception() where it would overwrite run->exit_reason on
a return of EMULATE_USER_EXIT.

Note, this technically doesn't fully fix task_switch_interception()
as it now incorrectly handles EMULATE_FAIL, but in practice there is no
bug as EMULATE_FAIL will never be returned for EMULTYPE_SKIP.
