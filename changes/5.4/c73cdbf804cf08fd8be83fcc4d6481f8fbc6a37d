drm/i915: Extend Haswell GT1 PSMI workaround to all

A few times in CI, we have detected a GPU hang on our Haswell GT2
systems with the characteristic IPEHR of 0x780c0000. When the PSMI w/a
was first introducted, it was applied to all Haswell, but later on we
found an erratum that supposedly restricted the issue to GT1 and so
constrained it only be applied on GT1. That may have been a mistake...
