net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: support 2500base-x in SGMII IRQ handler

The mv88e6390_serdes_irq_link_sgmii IRQ handler reads the SERDES PHY
status register to determine speed, among other things. If cmode of the
port is set to 2500base-x, though, the PHY still reports 1000 Mbps (the
PHY register itself does not differentiate between 1000 Mbps and 2500
Mbps - it thinks it is running at 1000 Mbps, although clock is 2.5x
faster).
Look at the cmode and set SPEED_2500 if cmode is set to 2500base-x.
Also tell mv88e6xxx_port_setup_mac the PHY interface mode corresponding
to current cmode in terms of phy_interface_t.
