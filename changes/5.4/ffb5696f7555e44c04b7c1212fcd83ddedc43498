xfs: reinitialize rm_flags when unpacking an offset into an rmap irec

In xfs_rmap_irec_offset_unpack, we should always clear the contents of
rm_flags before we begin unpacking the encoded (ondisk) offset into the
incore rm_offset and incore rm_flags fields.  Remove the open-coded
field zeroing as this encourages api misuse.
