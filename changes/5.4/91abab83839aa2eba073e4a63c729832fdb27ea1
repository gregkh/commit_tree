XArray: Fix xas_next() with a single entry at 0

If there is only a single entry at 0, the first time we call xas_next(),
we return the entry.  Unfortunately, all subsequent times we call
xas_next(), we also return the entry at 0 instead of noticing that the
xa_index is now greater than zero.  This broke find_get_pages_contig().
