powerpc/kvm: Use UV_RETURN ucall to return to ultravisor

When an SVM makes an hypercall or incurs some other exception, the
Ultravisor usually forwards (a.k.a. reflects) the exceptions to the
Hypervisor. After processing the exception, Hypervisor uses the
UV_RETURN ultracall to return control back to the SVM.

The expected register state on entry to this ultracall is:

* Non-volatile registers are restored to their original values.
* If returning from an hypercall, register R0 contains the return value
  (unlike other ultracalls) and, registers R4 through R12 contain any
  output values of the hypercall.
* R3 contains the ultracall number, i.e UV_RETURN.
* If returning with a synthesized interrupt, R2 contains the
  synthesized interrupt number.
