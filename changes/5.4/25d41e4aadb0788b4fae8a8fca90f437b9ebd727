iocost: better trace vrate changes

vrate_adj tracepoint traces vrate changes; however, it does so only
when busy_level is non-zero.  busy_level turning to zero can sometimes
be as interesting an event.  This patch also enables vrate_adj
tracepoint on other vrate related events - busy_level changes and
non-zero nr_lagging.
