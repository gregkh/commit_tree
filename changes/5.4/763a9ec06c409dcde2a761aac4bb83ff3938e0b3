sched/fair: Fix -Wunused-but-set-variable warnings

Commit:

   de53fd7aedb1 ("sched/fair: Fix low cpu usage with high throttling by removing expiration of cpu-local slices")

introduced a few compilation warnings:

  kernel/sched/fair.c: In function '__refill_cfs_bandwidth_runtime':
  kernel/sched/fair.c:4365:6: warning: variable 'now' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  kernel/sched/fair.c: In function 'start_cfs_bandwidth':
  kernel/sched/fair.c:4992:6: warning: variable 'overrun' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

Also, __refill_cfs_bandwidth_runtime() does no longer update the
expiration time, so fix the comments accordingly.
