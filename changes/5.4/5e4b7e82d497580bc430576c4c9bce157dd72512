clk: qcom: gcc-sdm845: Use floor ops for sdcc clks

Some MMC cards fail to enumerate properly when inserted into an MMC slot
on sdm845 devices. This is because the clk ops for qcom clks round the
frequency up to the nearest rate instead of down to the nearest rate.
For example, the MMC driver requests a frequency of 52MHz from
clk_set_rate() but the qcom implementation for these clks rounds 52MHz
up to the next supported frequency of 100MHz. The MMC driver could be
modified to request clk rate ranges but for now we can fix this in the
clk driver by changing the rounding policy for this clk to be round down
instead of round up.
