perf evsel: Add missing perf/evsel.h header in util/evsel.h

Since util/evsel.h uses perf_evsel__cpus() that has its prototype in
libperf's perf/evsel.h file, we need it explicitely included.

This was working by luck as util/evsel.h includes counts.h, but that is
not necessary, just some forward declarations, so, before we remove
counts.h from util/evsel.h, add what is realli needed.
