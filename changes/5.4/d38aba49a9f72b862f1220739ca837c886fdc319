bug: lift "cut here" out of __warn()

In preparation for cleaning up "cut here", move the "cut here" logic up
out of __warn() and into callers that pass non-NULL args.  For anyone
looking closely, there are two callers that pass NULL args: one already
explicitly prints "cut here".  The remaining case is covered by how a WARN
is built, which will be cleaned up in the next patch.
