null_blk: do not fail the module load with zero devices

The module load should fail only if there is something wrong with the
configuration or if an error prevents it to work properly. The module
should be able to be loaded with (nr_device == 0), since it will not
trigger errors or be in malfunction state. Preventing loading with zero
devices also breaks applications that configures this module using
configfs API. Remove the nr_device check to fix this.
