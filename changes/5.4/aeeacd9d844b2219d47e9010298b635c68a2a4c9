rcu/nocb: Enable re-awakening under high callback load

The __call_rcu_nocb_wake() function and its predecessors set
->qlen_last_fqs_check to zero for the first callback and to LONG_MAX / 2
for forced reawakenings.  The former can result in a too-quick reawakening
when there are many callbacks ready to invoke and the latter prevents a
second reawakening.  This commit therefore sets ->qlen_last_fqs_check
to the current number of callbacks in both cases.  While in the area,
this commit also moves both assignments under ->nocb_lock.
