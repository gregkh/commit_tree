ASoC: Intel: Haswell: Adjust machine device private context

Apart from Haswell machines, all other devices have their private data
set to snd_soc_acpi_mach instance.

Changes for HSW/ BDW boards introduced with series:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/cover/10782035/

added support for dai_link platform_name adjustments within card probe
routines. These take for granted private_data points to
snd_soc_acpi_mach whereas for Haswell, it's sst_pdata instead. Change
private context of platform_device - representing machine board - to
address this.
