dm stats: use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct dm_stat {
	...
        struct dm_stat_shared stat_shared[0];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(struct dm_stat) + (size_t)n_entries * sizeof(struct dm_stat_shared)

with:

struct_size(s, stat_shared, n_entries)

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
