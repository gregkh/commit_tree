crypto: s5p - deal gracefully with bogus input sizes

The s5p skcipher driver returns -EINVAL for zero length inputs, which
deviates from the behavior of the generic ECB template, and causes fuzz
tests to fail. In cases where the input is not a multiple of the AES
block size (and the chaining mode is not CTR), it prints an error to
the kernel log, which is a thing we usually try to avoid in response
to situations that can be triggered by unprivileged users.
