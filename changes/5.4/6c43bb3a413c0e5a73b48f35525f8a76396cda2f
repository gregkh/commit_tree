can: netns: give structs holding the CAN statistics a sensible name

This patch renames both "struct s_stats" and "struct s_pstats", to
"struct can_pkg_stats" and "struct can_rcv_lists_stats" to better
reflect their meaning and improve code readability.

The conversion is done with:

	sed -i \
		-e "s/struct s_stats/struct can_pkg_stats/g" \
		-e "s/struct s_pstats/struct can_rcv_lists_stats/g" \
		net/can/*.[ch] \
		include/net/netns/can.h
