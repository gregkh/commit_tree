nfp: flower: offload MPLS pop action

Recent additions to the kernel include a TC action module to manipulate
MPLS headers on packets. Such actions are available to offload via the
flow_offload intermediate representation API.

Modify the NFP driver to allow the offload of MPLS pop actions to
firmware. The act_mpls TC module enforces that the next protocol is
supplied along with the pop action. Passing this to firmware allows it
to properly rebuild the underlying packet after the pop.
