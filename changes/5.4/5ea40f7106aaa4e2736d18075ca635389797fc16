ARM: dts: sunxi: Unify the DE2 bus clocks order

The DE2 bus takes two clocks, named bus and mod according to the binding.

However, the order of these clocks change from one SoC to another. Even
though it might not be an issue in most cases, having consistency will help
if we ever need to have some code to deal with deprecated bindings, and in
general it's just better.
