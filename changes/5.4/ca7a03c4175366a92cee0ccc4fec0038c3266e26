ipv6: do not free rt if FIB_LOOKUP_NOREF is set on suppress rule

Commit 7d9e5f422150 removed references from certain dsts, but accounting
for this never translated down into the fib6 suppression code. This bug
was triggered by WireGuard users who use wg-quick(8), which uses the
"suppress-prefix" directive to ip-rule(8) for routing all of their
internet traffic without routing loops. The test case added here
causes the reference underflow by causing packets to evaluate a suppress
rule.
