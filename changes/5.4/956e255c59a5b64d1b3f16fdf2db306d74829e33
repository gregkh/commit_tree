KVM: x86: svm: remove unneeded nested_enable_evmcs() hook

Since commit 5158917c7b019 ("KVM: x86: nVMX: Allow nested_enable_evmcs to
be NULL") the code in x86.c is prepared to see nested_enable_evmcs being
NULL and in VMX case it actually is when nesting is disabled. Remove the
unneeded stub from SVM code.
