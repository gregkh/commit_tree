soundwire: intel: fix intel_register_dai PDI offsets and numbers

There are two issues, likely copy/paste:

1. Use cdns->pcm.num_in instead of stream_num_in for consistency with
the rest of the code. This was not detected earlier since platforms did
not have input-only PDIs.

2. use the correct offset for bi-dir PDM, based on IN and OUT
PDIs. Again this was not detected since PDM was not supported earlier.
