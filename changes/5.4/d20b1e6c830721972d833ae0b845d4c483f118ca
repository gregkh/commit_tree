wil6210: Delete an unnecessary kfree() call in wil_tid_ampdu_rx_alloc()

A null pointer would be passed to a call of the function “kfree”
directly after a call of the function “kcalloc” failed at one place.
Remove this superfluous function call.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
