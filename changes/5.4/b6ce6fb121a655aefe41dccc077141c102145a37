scsi: scsi_dh_alua: handle RTPG sense code correctly during state transitions

Some arrays are not capable of returning RTPG data during state
transitioning, but rather return an 'LUN not accessible, asymmetric access
state transition' sense code. In these cases we can set the state to
'transitioning' directly and don't need to evaluate the RTPG data (which we
won't have anyway).
