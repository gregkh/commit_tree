riscv: don't use the rdtime(h) pseudo-instructions

If we just use the CSRs that these map to directly the code is simpler
and doesn't require extra inline assembly code.  Also fix up the top-level
comment in timer-riscv.c to not talk about the cycle count or mention
details of the clocksource interface, of which this file is just a
consumer.
