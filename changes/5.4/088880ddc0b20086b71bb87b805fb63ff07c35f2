drm/etnaviv: implement softpin

With softpin we allow the userspace to take control over the GPU virtual
address space. The new capability is relected by a bump of the minor DRM
version. There are a few restrictions for userspace to take into
account:

1. The kernel reserves a bit of the address space to implement zero page
faulting and mapping of the kernel internal ring buffer. Userspace can
query the kernel for the first usable GPU VM address via
ETNAVIV_PARAM_SOFTPIN_START_ADDR.

2. We only allow softpin on GPUs, which implement proper process
separation via PPAS. If softpin is not available the softpin start
address will be set to ~0.

3. Softpin is all or nothing. A submit using softpin must not use any
address fixups via relocs.
