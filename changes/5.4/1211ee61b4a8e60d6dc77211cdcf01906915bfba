powerpc/pseries: Read TLB Block Invalidate Characteristics

The PAPR document specifies the TLB Block Invalidate Characteristics
which tells for each pair of segment base page size, actual page size,
the size of the block the hcall H_BLOCK_REMOVE supports.

These characteristics are loaded at boot time in a new table
hblkr_size. The table is separate from the mmu_psize_def because this
is specific to the pseries platform.

A new init function, pseries_lpar_read_hblkrm_characteristics() is
added to read the characteristics. It is called from
pSeries_setup_arch().
