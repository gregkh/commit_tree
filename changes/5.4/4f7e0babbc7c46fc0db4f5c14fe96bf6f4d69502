powerpc/iommu: Allow bypass-only for DMA

POWER8 and newer support a bypass mode which maps all host memory to
PCI buses so an IOMMU table is not always required. However if we fail to
create such a table, the DMA setup fails and the kernel does not boot.

This skips the 32bit DMA setup check if the bypass is selected.
