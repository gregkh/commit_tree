tools: bpftool: compile with $(EXTRA_WARNINGS)

Compile bpftool with $(EXTRA_WARNINGS), as defined in
scripts/Makefile.include, and fix the new warnings produced.

Simply leave -Wswitch-enum out of the warning list, as we have several
switch-case structures where it is not desirable to process all values
of an enum.

Remove -Wshadow from the warnings we manually add to CFLAGS, as it is
handled in $(EXTRA_WARNINGS).
