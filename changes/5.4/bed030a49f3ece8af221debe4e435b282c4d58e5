drm/rockchip: Don't fully disable vop on self refresh

Instead of fully disabling and re-enabling the vop on self refresh
transitions, only disable the active windows. This will speed up
self refresh exits substantially and is still a power-savings win.

This patch integrates portions of Zain's patch from here:

Changes in v2:
- None
Changes in v3:
- None
Changes in v4:
