ARM: dts: Update the NSPIRE DTS files for DRM

The DRM subsystem graphics drivers require more granular
definition of the connection between display drivers and
panels, and a proper panel compatible. This utilizes the
bindings merged to the DRM subsystem to properly define
the display on the NSPIRE devices.

We also do away with the undocumented DT binding
"lcd-type".

We add both the clocks to the CLCD block so the driver
have full control over its clocking.
