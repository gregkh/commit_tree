drm/i915: rename intel_drv.h to display/intel_display_types.h

Everything about the file is about display, and mostly about types
related to display. Move under display/ as intel_display_types.h to
reflect the facts.

There's still plenty to clean up, but start off with moving the file
where it logically belongs and naming according to contents.

v2: fix the include guard name in the renamed file
