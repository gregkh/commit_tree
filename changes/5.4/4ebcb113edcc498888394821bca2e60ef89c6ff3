r8169: fix jumbo packet handling on resume from suspend

Mariusz reported that invalid packets are sent after resume from
suspend if jumbo packets are active. It turned out that his BIOS
resets chip settings to non-jumbo on resume. Most chip settings are
re-initialized on resume from suspend by calling rtl_hw_start(),
so let's add configuring jumbo to this function.
There's nothing wrong with the commit marked as fixed, it's just
the first one where the patch applies cleanly.
