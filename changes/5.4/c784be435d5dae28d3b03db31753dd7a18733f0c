powerpc/pseries: Fix cpu_hotplug_lock acquisition in resize_hpt()

The calls to arch_add_memory()/arch_remove_memory() are always made
with the read-side cpu_hotplug_lock acquired via memory_hotplug_begin().
On pSeries, arch_add_memory()/arch_remove_memory() eventually call
resize_hpt() which in turn calls stop_machine() which acquires the
read-side cpu_hotplug_lock again, thereby resulting in the recursive
acquisition of this lock.

In the absence of CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING, we hadn't observed a system
lockup during a memory hotplug operation because cpus_read_lock() is a
per-cpu rwsem read, which, in the fast-path (in the absence of the
writer, which in our case is a CPU-hotplug operation) simply
increments the read_count on the semaphore. Thus a recursive read in
the fast-path doesn't cause any problems.

However, we can hit this problem in practice if there is a concurrent
CPU-Hotplug operation in progress which is waiting to acquire the
write-side of the lock. This will cause the second recursive read to
block until the writer finishes. While the writer is blocked since the
first read holds the lock. Thus both the reader as well as the writers
fail to make any progress thereby blocking both CPU-Hotplug as well as
Memory Hotplug operations.

Memory-Hotplug				CPU-Hotplug
CPU 0					CPU 1
------                                  ------

1. down_read(cpu_hotplug_lock.rw_sem)
   [memory_hotplug_begin]
					2. down_write(cpu_hotplug_lock.rw_sem)
					[cpu_up/cpu_down]
3. down_read(cpu_hotplug_lock.rw_sem)
   [stop_machine()]

Lockdep complains as follows in these code-paths.

 swapper/0/1 is trying to acquire lock:
 (____ptrval____) (cpu_hotplug_lock.rw_sem){++++}, at: stop_machine+0x2c/0x60

but task is already holding lock:
(____ptrval____) (cpu_hotplug_lock.rw_sem){++++}, at: mem_hotplug_begin+0x20/0x50

 other info that might help us debug this:
  Possible unsafe locking scenario:

        CPU0
        ----
   lock(cpu_hotplug_lock.rw_sem);
   lock(cpu_hotplug_lock.rw_sem);

  *** DEADLOCK ***

  May be due to missing lock nesting notation

Fix this issue by
  1) Requiring all the calls to pseries_lpar_resize_hpt() be made
     with cpu_hotplug_lock held.

  2) In pseries_lpar_resize_hpt() invoke stop_machine_cpuslocked()
     as a consequence of 1)

  3) To satisfy 1), in hpt_order_set(), call mmu_hash_ops.resize_hpt()
     with cpu_hotplug_lock held.
