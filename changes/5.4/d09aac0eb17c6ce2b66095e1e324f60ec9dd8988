firmware: arm_scmi: Add asynchronous sensor read if it supports

SENSOR_DESCRIPTION_GET provides attributes to indicate if the sensor
supports asynchronous read. We can read that flag and use asynchronous
reads for any sensors with that attribute set.

Let's use the new scmi_do_xfer_with_response to support asynchronous
sensor reads.
