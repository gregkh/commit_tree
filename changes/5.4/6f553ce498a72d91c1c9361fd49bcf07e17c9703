drivers/gpu/drm/via: convert put_page() to put_user_page*()

For pages that were retained via get_user_pages*(), release those pages
via the new put_user_page*() routines, instead of via put_page() or
release_pages().

This is part a tree-wide conversion, as described in fc1d8e7cca2d ("mm:
introduce put_user_page*(), placeholder versions").

Also reverse the order of a comparison, in order to placate checkpatch.pl.
