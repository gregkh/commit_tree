mfd / platform: cros_ec: Reorganize platform and mfd includes

There is a bit of mess between cros-ec mfd includes and platform
includes. For example, we have a linux/mfd/cros_ec.h include that
exports the interface implemented in platform/chrome/cros_ec_proto.c. Or
we have a linux/mfd/cros_ec_commands.h file that is non related to the
multifunction device (in the sense that is not exporting any function of
the mfd device). This causes crossed includes between mfd and
platform/chrome subsystems and makes the code difficult to read, apart
from creating 'curious' situations where a platform/chrome driver includes
a linux/mfd/cros_ec.h file just to get the exported functions that are
implemented in another platform/chrome driver.

In order to have a better separation on what the cros-ec multifunction
driver does and what the cros-ec core provides move and rework the
affected includes doing:

 - Move cros_ec_commands.h to include/linux/platform_data/cros_ec_commands.h
 - Get rid of the parts that are implemented in the platform/chrome/cros_ec_proto.c
   driver from include/linux/mfd/cros_ec.h to a new file
   include/linux/platform_data/cros_ec_proto.h
 - Update all the drivers with the new includes, so
   - Drivers that only need to know about the protocol include
     - linux/platform_data/cros_ec_proto.h
     - linux/platform_data/cros_ec_commands.h
   - Drivers that need to know about the cros-ec mfd device also include
     - linux/mfd/cros_ec.h
