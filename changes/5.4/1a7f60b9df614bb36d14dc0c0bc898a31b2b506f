Revert "ALSA: hda: Flush interrupts on disabling"

This reverts commit caa8422d01e983782548648e125fd617cadcec3f.

It turned out that this commit caused a regression at shutdown /
reboot, as the synchronize_irq() calls seems blocking the whole
shutdown.  Also another part of the change about shuffling the call
order looks suspicious; the azx_stop_chip() call disables the CORB /
RIRB while the others may still need the CORB/RIRB update.

Since the original commit itself was a cargo-fix, let's revert the
whole patch.
