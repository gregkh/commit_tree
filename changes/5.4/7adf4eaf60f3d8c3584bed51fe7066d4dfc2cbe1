io_uring: fix sequence logic for timeout requests

We have two ways a request can be deferred:

1) It's a regular request that depends on another one
2) It's a timeout that tracks completions

We have a shared helper to determine whether to defer, and that
attempts to make the right decision based on the request. But we
only have some of this information in the caller. Un-share the
two timeout/defer helpers so the caller can use the right one.
