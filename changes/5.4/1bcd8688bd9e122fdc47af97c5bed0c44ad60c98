drm/i915: Dynamically allocate s0ix struct for VLV

This is only required for a single platform so no need to reserve the
memory on all of them.

This removes the last direct dependency of i915_drv.h on i915_reg.h
(apart from the i915_reg_t definition).

v2: drop unneeded diff, keep the vlv prefix, call functions
    unconditionally (Jani), fwd declaration of the struct (Chris)
