cpuidle-haltpoll: do not set an owner to allow modunload

cpuidle-haltpoll can be built as a module to allow optional late load.
Given we are setting @owner to THIS_MODULE, cpuidle will attempt to grab a
module reference every time a cpuidle_device is registered -- so
essentially all online cpus get a reference.

This prevents for the module to be unloaded later, which makes the
module_exit callback entirely unused. Thus remove the @owner and allow
module to be unloaded.
