KVM: x86: Remove emulation_result enums, EMULATE_{DONE,FAIL,USER_EXIT}

Deferring emulation failure handling (in some cases) to the caller of
x86_emulate_instruction() has proven fragile, e.g. multiple instances of
KVM not setting run->exit_reason on EMULATE_FAIL, largely due to it
being difficult to discern what emulation types can return what result,
and which combination of types and results are handled where.

Now that x86_emulate_instruction() always handles emulation failure,
i.e. EMULATION_FAIL is only referenced in callers, remove the
emulation_result enums entirely.  Per KVM's existing exit handling
conventions, return '0' and '1' for "exit to userspace" and "resume
guest" respectively.  Doing so cleans up many callers, e.g. they can
return kvm_emulate_instruction() directly instead of having to interpret
its result.
