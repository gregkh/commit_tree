staging: wlan-ng: Remove function hfa384x_dowrid_wait()

Remove inline function hfa384x_dowrid_wait as it is only called once (in
hfa384x_drvr_setconfig) and its contents are only a single line (a call
to hfa384x_dowrid).
Replace the call to hfa384x_dowrid_wait with its contents i.e the call
to hfa384x_dowrid.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
