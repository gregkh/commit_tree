perf trace: Put the per-syscall entry/exit prog_array BPF map infrastructure in place

I.e. look for "syscalls_sys_enter" and "syscalls_sys_exit" BPF maps of
type PROG_ARRAY and populate it with the handlers as specified per
syscall, for now only 'open' is wiring it to something, in time all
syscalls that need to copy arguments entering a syscall or returning
from one will set these to the right handlers, reusing when possible
pre-existing ones.

Next step is to use bpf_tail_call() into that.
