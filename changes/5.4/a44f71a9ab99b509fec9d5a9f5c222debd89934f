bug: move WARN_ON() "cut here" into exception handler

The original clean up of "cut here" missed the WARN_ON() case (that does
not have a printk message), which was fixed recently by adding an explicit
printk of "cut here".  This had the downside of adding a printk() to every
WARN_ON() caller, which reduces the utility of using an instruction
exception to streamline the resulting code.  By making this a new BUGFLAG,
all of these can be removed and "cut here" can be handled by the exception
handler.

This was very pronounced on PowerPC, but the effect can be seen on x86 as
well.  The resulting text size of a defconfig build shows some small
savings from this patch:

   text    data     bss     dec     hex filename
19691167        5134320 1646664 26472151        193eed7 vmlinux.before
19676362        5134260 1663048 26473670        193f4c6 vmlinux.after

This change also opens the door for creating something like BUG_MSG(),
where a custom printk() before issuing BUG(), without confusing the "cut
here" line.
