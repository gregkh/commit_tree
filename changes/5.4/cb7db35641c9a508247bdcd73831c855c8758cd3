ice: Only bump Rx tail and release buffers once per napi_poll

Currently we bump the Rx tail and release/give buffers to hardware every
16 descriptors. This causes us to bump Rx tail up to 4 times per
napi_poll call. Also we are always bumping tail on an odd index and this
is a problem because hardware ignores the lower 3 bits in the QRX_TAIL
register. This is making it so hardware sees tail bumps only every 8
descriptors. Instead lets only bump Rx tail once per napi_poll if
the value aligns with hardware's expectations of the lower 3 bits being
cleared. Also only release/give Rx buffers once per napi_poll call.
