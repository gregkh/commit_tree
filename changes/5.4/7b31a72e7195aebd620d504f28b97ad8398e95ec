dt-bindings: Add PCIe supports-clkreq property

Some host controllers need to know the existence of clkreq signal routing
to downstream devices to be able to advertise low power features like
ASPM L1 substates. Without clkreq signal routing being present, enabling
ASPM L1 substates might lead to downstream devices being disconnected
from the bus. Hence a new device tree property 'supports-clkreq' is added
to make such host controllers aware of clkreq signal routing to
downstream devices.
