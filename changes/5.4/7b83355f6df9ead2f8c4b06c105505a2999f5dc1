net/mlx5e: Fix ingress rate configuration for representors

Current code uses the old method of prio encoding in
flow_cls_common_offload. Fix to follow the changes introduced in
commit ef01adae0e43 ("net: sched: use major priority number as hardware priority").

Fixes: fcb64c0f5640 ("net/mlx5: E-Switch, add ingress rate support")
