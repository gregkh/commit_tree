mm/memory-failure: poison read receives SIGKILL instead of SIGBUS if mmaped more than once

Mmap /dev/dax more than once, then read the poison location using
address from one of the mappings.  The other mappings due to not having
the page mapped in will cause SIGKILLs delivered to the process.
SIGKILL succeeds over SIGBUS, so user process loses the opportunity to
handle the UE.

Although one may add MAP_POPULATE to mmap(2) to work around the issue,
MAP_POPULATE makes mapping 128GB of pmem several magnitudes slower, so
isn't always an option.
