sched/uclamp: Propagate parent clamps

In order to properly support hierarchical resources control, the cgroup
delegation model requires that attribute writes from a child group never
fail but still are locally consistent and constrained based on parent's
assigned resources. This requires to properly propagate and aggregate
parent attributes down to its descendants.

Implement this mechanism by adding a new "effective" clamp value for each
task group. The effective clamp value is defined as the smaller value
between the clamp value of a group and the effective clamp value of its
parent. This is the actual clamp value enforced on tasks in a task group.

Since it's possible for a cpu.uclamp.min value to be bigger than the
cpu.uclamp.max value, ensure local consistency by restricting each
"protection" (i.e. min utilization) with the corresponding "limit"
(i.e. max utilization).

Do that at effective clamps propagation to ensure all user-space write
never fails while still always tracking the most restrictive values.
