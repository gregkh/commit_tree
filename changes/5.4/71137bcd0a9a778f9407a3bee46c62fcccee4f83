ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Move the format configuration to a callback

The two main generations of our I2S controller require a slightly different
format configuration, mostly because of a quite different register layout
and some additional registers being needed on the newer generation.

This used to be controlled through a bunch of booleans, however this proved
to be quite impractical, especially since a bunch of SoCs forgot to set
those parameters and therefore were broken from that point of view.
