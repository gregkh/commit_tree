ASoC: pcm3168a: Retain the independence of DAC and ADC side of the codec

The DAC and ADC path of the codec is independent, have dedicated LRCK (FS)
and BCK for DAC/ADC.

They can be configured to use different format, TDM slots and slot_width if
needed.

Move these parameters under dedicated io_params structure and manage them
independently based on the dai.
