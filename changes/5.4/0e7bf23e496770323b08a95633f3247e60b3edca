ath6kl: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in ath6kl_htc_mbox_create()

In ath6kl_htc_mbox_create(), when kzalloc() on line 2855 fails,
target->dev is assigned to NULL, and ath6kl_htc_mbox_cleanup(target) is
called on line 2885.

In ath6kl_htc_mbox_cleanup(), target->dev is used on line 2895:
    ath6kl_hif_cleanup_scatter(target->dev->ar);

Thus, a null-pointer dereference may occur.

To fix this bug, kfree(target) is called and NULL is returned when
kzalloc() on line 2855 fails.

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
