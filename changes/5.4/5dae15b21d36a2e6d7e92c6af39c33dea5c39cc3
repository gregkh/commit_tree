phy: tegra: Add PCIe PIPE2UPHY support

Synopsys DesignWare core based PCIe controllers in Tegra 194 SoC
interface with Universal PHY (UPHY) module through a PIPE2UPHY (P2U)
module. For each PCIe lane of a controller, there is a P2U unit
instantiated at hardware level. This driver provides support for the
programming required for each P2U that is going to be used for a PCIe
controller.
