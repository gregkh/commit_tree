ASoC: rsnd: Support hw_free() callback at DAI level

This patch provides the needed infrastructure to support calling hw_free()
at the DAI level. This is for example required to free resources allocated
in hw_params() callback.

The modification of __rsnd_mod_add_hw_params does not have any side
effects because rsnd_mod_ops::hw_params callback is not used by anyone
until now.
