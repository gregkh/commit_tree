Revert "blackhole_netdev: fix syzkaller reported issue"

This reverts commit b0818f80c8c1bc215bba276bd61c216014fab23b.

Started seeing weird behavior after this patch especially in
the IPv6 code path. Haven't root caused it, but since this was
applied to net branch, taking a precautionary measure to revert
it and look / analyze those failures

Revert this now and I'll send a better fix after analysing / fixing
the weirdness observed.
