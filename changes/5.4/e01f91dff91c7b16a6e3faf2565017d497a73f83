nvme-multipath: fix ana log nsid lookup when nsid is not found

ANA log parsing invokes nvme_update_ana_state() per ANA group desc.
This updates the state of namespaces with nsids in desc->nsids[].

Both ctrl->namespaces list and desc->nsids[] array are sorted by nsid.
Hence nvme_update_ana_state() performs a single walk over ctrl->namespaces:
- if current namespace matches the current desc->nsids[n],
  this namespace is updated, and n is incremented.
- the process stops when it encounters the end of either
  ctrl->namespaces end or desc->nsids[]

In case desc->nsids[n] does not match any of ctrl->namespaces,
the remaining nsids following desc->nsids[n] will not be updated.
Such situation was considered abnormal and generated WARN_ON_ONCE.

However ANA log MAY contain nsids not (yet) found in ctrl->namespaces.
For example, lets consider the following scenario:
- nvme0 exposes namespaces with nsids = [2, 3] to the host
- a new namespace nsid = 1 is added dynamically
- also, a ANA topology change is triggered
- NS_CHANGED aen is generated and triggers scan_work
- before scan_work discovers nsid=1 and creates a namespace, a NOTICE_ANA
  aen was issues and ana_work receives ANA log with nsids=[1, 2, 3]

Result: ana_work fails to update ANA state on existing namespaces [2, 3]

Solution:
Change the way nvme_update_ana_state() namespace list walk
checks the current namespace against desc->nsids[n] as follows:
a) ns->head->ns_id < desc->nsids[n]: keep walking ctrl->namespaces.
b) ns->head->ns_id == desc->nsids[n]: match, update the namespace
c) ns->head->ns_id >= desc->nsids[n]: skip to desc->nsids[n+1]

This enables correct operation in the scenario described above.
This also allows ANA log to contain nsids currently invisible
to the host, i.e. inactive nsids.
