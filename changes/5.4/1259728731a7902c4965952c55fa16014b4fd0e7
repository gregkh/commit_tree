fuse: add simple background helper

Create a helper named fuse_simple_background() that is similar to
fuse_simple_request().  Unlike the latter, it returns immediately and calls
the supplied 'end' callback when the reply is received.

The supplied 'args' pointer is stored in 'fuse_req' which allows the
callback to interpret the output arguments decoded from the reply.
