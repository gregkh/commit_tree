arm64: Do not mask out PTE_RDONLY in pte_same()

Following commit 73e86cb03cf2 ("arm64: Move PTE_RDONLY bit handling out
of set_pte_at()"), the PTE_RDONLY bit is no longer managed by
set_pte_at() but built into the PAGE_* attribute definitions.
Consequently, pte_same() must include this bit when checking two PTEs
for equality.

Remove the arm64-specific pte_same() function, practically reverting
commit 747a70e60b72 ("arm64: Fix copy-on-write referencing in HugeTLB")
