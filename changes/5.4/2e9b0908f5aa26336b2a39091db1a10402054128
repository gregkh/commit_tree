memory: mtk-smi: Use a general config_port interface

The config_port of mt2712 and mt8183 are the same. Use a general
config_port interface instead.

In addition, in mt2712, larb8 and larb9 are the bdpsys larbs which
are not the normal larb, their register space are different from the
normal one. thus, we can not call the general config_port. In mt8183,
IPU0/1 and CCU connect with smi-common directly, they also are not
the normal larb. Hence, we add a "larb_direct_to_common_mask" for these
larbs which connect to smi-commmon directly.

This is also a preparing patch for adding mt8183 SMI support.
