drm/msm: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct msm_gem_submit {
	...
        struct {
		...
        } bos[0];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*submit) + ((u64)nr_bos * sizeof(submit->bos[0]))

with:

struct_size(submit, bos, nr_bos)
