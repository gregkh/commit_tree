mac80211_hwsim: Extended Key ID API update

Prepare hwsim Extended Key ID support for a mac80211 API change.

The mac80211 flag IEEE80211_HW_EXT_KEY_ID_NATIVE is being replaced by
NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_EXT_KEY_ID which only must be set by drivers when
they support HW crypto.

This reverts commit cfe7007a9b4c ("mac80211_hwsim: Extended Key ID support").
