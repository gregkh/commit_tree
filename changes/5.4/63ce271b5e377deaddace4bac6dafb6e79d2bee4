powerpc/prom: convert PROM_BUG() to standard trap

Prior to commit 1bd98d7fbaf5 ("ppc64: Update BUG handling based on
ppc32"), BUG() family was using BUG_ILLEGAL_INSTRUCTION which
was an invalid instruction opcode to trap into program check
exception.

That commit converted them to using standard trap instructions,
but prom/prom_init and their PROM_BUG() macro were left over.
head_64.S and exception-64s.S were left aside as well.

Convert them to using the standard BUG infrastructure.
