libperf: Move perf_event_attr field from perf's evsel to libperf's perf_evsel

Move the perf_event_attr struct fron 'struct evsel' to 'struct perf_evsel'.

Committer notes:

Fixed up these:

 tools/perf/arch/arm/util/auxtrace.c
 tools/perf/arch/arm/util/cs-etm.c
 tools/perf/arch/arm64/util/arm-spe.c
 tools/perf/arch/s390/util/auxtrace.c
 tools/perf/util/cs-etm.c

Also

  cc1: warnings being treated as errors
  tests/sample-parsing.c: In function 'do_test':
  tests/sample-parsing.c:162: error: missing initializer
  tests/sample-parsing.c:162: error: (near initialization for 'evsel.core.cpus')

   	struct evsel evsel = {
   		.needs_swap = false,
  -		.core.attr = {
  -			.sample_type = sample_type,
  -			.read_format = read_format,
  +		.core = {
  +			. attr = {
  +				.sample_type = sample_type,
  +				.read_format = read_format,
  +			},

  [perfbuilder@a70e4eeb5549 /]$ gcc --version |& head -1
  gcc (GCC) 4.4.7

Also we don't need to include perf_event.h in
tools/perf/lib/include/perf/evsel.h, forward declaring 'struct
perf_event_attr' is enough. And this even fixes the build in some
systems where things are used somewhere down the include path from
perf_event.h without defining __always_inline.
