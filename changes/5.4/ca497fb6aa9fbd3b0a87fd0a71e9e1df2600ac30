taprio: remove unused variable 'entry_list_policy'

net/sched/sch_taprio.c:680:32: warning:
 entry_list_policy defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]

One of the points of commit a3d43c0d56f1 ("taprio: Add support adding
an admin schedule") is that it removes support (it now returns "not
supported") for schedules using the TCA_TAPRIO_ATTR_SCHED_SINGLE_ENTRY
attribute (which were never used), the parsing of those types of schedules
was the only user of this policy. So removing this policy should be fine.
