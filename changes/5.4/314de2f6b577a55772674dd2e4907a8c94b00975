ARM: dts: exynos: Use standard arrays of generic PHYs for EHCI/OHCI devices

Move USB PHYs to a standard arrays for Exynos EHCI/OHCI devices. This
resolves the conflict between Exynos EHCI/OHCI sub-nodes and generic USB
device bindings. Once the Exynos EHCI/OHCI sub-nodes are removed, the
boards can finally provide sub-nodes for the USB devices using generic USB
device bindings.
