btrfs: create structure to encode checksum type and length

Create a structure to encode the type and length for the known on-disk
checksums.  This makes it easier to add new checksums later.

The structure and helpers are moved from ctree.h so they don't occupy
space in all headers including ctree.h. This save some space in the
final object.
