PCI/P2PDMA: Add constants for map type results to upstream_bridge_distance()

Add constant flags to indicate how two devices will be mapped or if they
are unsupported. upstream_bridge_distance() will now return the
mapping type and the distance in a passed-by-reference argument.

This helps annotate the code better, but the main reason is so we can use
the information to store the required mapping method in an xarray.
