Drivers: hv: vmbus: Ignore the offers when resuming from hibernation

When the VM resumes, the host re-sends the offers. We should not add the
offers to the global vmbus_connection.chn_list again.

This patch assumes the RELIDs of the channels don't change across
hibernation. Actually this is not always true, especially in the case of
NIC SR-IOV the VF vmbus device's RELID sometimes can change. A later patch
will address this issue by mapping the new offers to the old channels and
fixing up the old channels, if necessary.
