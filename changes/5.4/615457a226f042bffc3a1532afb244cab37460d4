ice: fix potential infinite loop because loop counter being too small

Currently the for-loop counter i is a u8 however it is being checked
against a maximum value hw->num_tx_sched_layers which is a u16. Hence
there is a potential wrap-around of counter i back to zero if
hw->num_tx_sched_layers is greater than 255.  Fix this by making i
a u16.
