drm/amd/display: readd -msse2 to prevent Clang from emitting libcalls to undefined SW FP routines

arch/x86/Makefile disables SSE and SSE2 for the whole kernel.  The
AMDGPU drivers modified in this patch re-enable SSE but not SSE2.  Turn
on SSE2 to support emitting double precision floating point instructions
rather than calls to non-existent (usually available from gcc_s or
compiler_rt) floating point helper routines for Clang.

This was originally landed in:
commit 10117450735c ("drm/amd/display: add -msse2 to prevent Clang from emitting libcalls to undefined SW FP routines")
but reverted in:
commit 193392ed9f69 ("Revert "drm/amd/display: add -msse2 to prevent Clang from emitting libcalls to undefined SW FP routines"")
due to bugreports from GCC builds. Add guards to only do so for Clang.
