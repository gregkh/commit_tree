sched/fair: Introduce fits_capacity()

The same formula to check utilization against capacity (after
considering capacity_margin) is already used at 5 different locations.

This patch creates a new macro, fits_capacity(), which can be used from
all these locations without exposing the details of it and hence
simplify code.

All the 5 code locations are updated as well to use it..
