drm/i915: Fix up the inverse mapping for default ctx->engines[]

The order in which we store the engines inside default_engines() for the
legacy ctx->engines[] has to match the legacy I915_EXEC_RING selector
mapping in execbuf::user_map. If we present VCS2 as being the second
instance of the video engine, legacy userspace calls that I915_EXEC_BSD2
and so we need to insert it into the second video slot.

v2: Record the legacy mapping (hopefully we can remove this need in the
future)
