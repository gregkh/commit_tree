net: sched: taprio: Fix potential integer overflow in taprio_set_picos_per_byte

The speed divisor is used in a context expecting an s64, but it is
evaluated using 32-bit arithmetic.

To avoid that happening, instead of multiplying by 1,000,000 in the
first place, simplify the fraction and do a standard 32 bit division
instead.
