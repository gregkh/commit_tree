net: hwbm: if CONFIG_NET_HWBM unset, make stub functions static

If CONFIG_NET_HWBM is not set, then these stub functions in
<net/hwbm.h> should be declared static to avoid trying to
export them from any driver that includes this.

Fixes the following sparse warnings:

./include/net/hwbm.h:24:6: warning: symbol 'hwbm_buf_free' was not declared. Should it be static?
./include/net/hwbm.h:25:5: warning: symbol 'hwbm_pool_refill' was not declared. Should it be static?
./include/net/hwbm.h:26:5: warning: symbol 'hwbm_pool_add' was not declared. Should it be static?
