drm/i915: buddy allocator

Simple buddy allocator. We want to allocate properly aligned
power-of-two blocks to promote usage of huge-pages for the GTT, so 64K,
2M and possibly even 1G. While we do support allocating stuff at a
specific offset, it is more intended for preallocating portions of the
address space, say for an initial framebuffer, for other uses drm_mm is
probably a much better fit. Anyway, hopefully this can all be thrown
away if we eventually move to having the core MM manage device memory.
