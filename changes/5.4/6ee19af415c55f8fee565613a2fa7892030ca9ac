iio:magn: preenable/postenable/predisable fixup for ST magn buffer

This patch is trying to cleanup for good the buffers operation functions.
Let's rename the goto label using operation to perform and not
where it fails.

Not stable material as not fixing a 'bug' but rather bringing the
driver in line with general 'patterns' to allow a subsystem wide
cleanup.
