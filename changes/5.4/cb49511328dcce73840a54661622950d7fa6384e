btrfs: define separate btrfs_set/get_XX helpers

There are helpers for all type widths defined via macro and optionally
can use a token which is a cached pointer to avoid repeated mapping of
the extent buffer.

The token value is known at compile time, when it's valid it's always
address of a local variable, otherwise it's NULL passed by the
token-less helpers.

This can be utilized to remove some branching as the helpers are used
frequenlty.
