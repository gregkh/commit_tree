nbd: verify socket is supported during setup

nbd requires socket families to support the shutdown method so the nbd
recv workqueue can be woken up from its sock_recvmsg call. If the socket
does not support the callout we will leave recv works running or get hangs
later when the device or module is removed.

This adds a check during socket connection/reconnection to make sure the
socket being passed in supports the needed callout.
