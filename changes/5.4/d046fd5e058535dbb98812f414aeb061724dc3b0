USB: usblcd: drop redundant lcd mutex

Drop the redundant lcd mutex introduced by commit 925ce689bb31 ("USB:
autoconvert trivial BKL users to private mutex") which replaced an
earlier BKL use.

The lock serialised calls to open() against other open() and a custom
ioctl() returning the bcdDevice (sic!), but neither is needed.
