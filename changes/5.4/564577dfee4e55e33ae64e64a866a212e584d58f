can: netns: remove "can_" prefix from members struct netns_can

This patch improves the code reability by removing the redundant "can_"
prefix from the members of struct netns_can (as the struct netns_can itself
is the member "can" of the struct net.)

The conversion is done with:

	sed -i \
		-e "s/struct can_dev_rcv_lists \*can_rx_alldev_list;/struct can_dev_rcv_lists *rx_alldev_list;/" \
		-e "s/spinlock_t can_rcvlists_lock;/spinlock_t rcvlists_lock;/" \
		-e "s/struct timer_list can_stattimer;/struct timer_list stattimer; /" \
		-e "s/can\.can_rx_alldev_list/can.rx_alldev_list/g" \
		-e "s/can\.can_rcvlists_lock/can.rcvlists_lock/g" \
		-e "s/can\.can_stattimer/can.stattimer/g" \
		include/net/netns/can.h \
		net/can/*.[ch]
