8250_lpss: check null return when calling pci_ioremap_bar

pci_ioremap_bar may return null. This is eventually de-referenced at
drivers/dma/dw/core.c:1154 and drivers/dma/dw/core.c:1168. A null check
is needed to prevent null de-reference. I am adding the check and in
case of failure. Thanks to Andy Shevchenko for the hint on the necessity
of pci_iounmap when exiting.
