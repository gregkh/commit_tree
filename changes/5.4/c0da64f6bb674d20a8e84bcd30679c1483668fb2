fs: fat: Initialize filesystem timestamp ranges

Fill in the appropriate limits to avoid inconsistencies
in the vfs cached inode times when timestamps are
outside the permitted range.

Some FAT variants indicate that the years after 2099 are not supported.
Since commit 7decd1cb0305 ("fat: Fix and cleanup timestamp conversion")
we support the full range of years that can be represented, up to 2107.
