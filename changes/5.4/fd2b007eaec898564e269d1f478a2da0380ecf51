btrfs: tracepoints: Fix wrong parameter order for qgroup events

[BUG]
For btrfs:qgroup_meta_reserve event, the trace event can output garbage:

  qgroup_meta_reserve: 9c7f6acc-b342-4037-bc47-7f6e4d2232d7: refroot=5(FS_TREE) type=DATA diff=2

The diff should always be alinged to sector size (4k), so there is
definitely something wrong.

[CAUSE]
For the wrong @diff, it's caused by wrong parameter order.
The correct parameters are:

  struct btrfs_root, s64 diff, int type.

However the parameters used are:

  struct btrfs_root, int type, s64 diff.
