drm/hibmc: Update struct drm_driver for GEM object functions

The GEM object's free function is now called through struct
drm_gem_object_funcs.free. The function struct drm_driver.gem_prime_mmap
is now required for mmap'ing GEM objects to userspace.

v2:
	* set drm_driver.gem_prime_mmap to drm_gem_prime_mmap()
