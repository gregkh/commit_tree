net: bridge: mcast: add delete due to fast-leave mdb flag

In user-space there's no way to distinguish why an mdb entry was deleted
and that is a problem for daemons which would like to keep the mdb in
sync with remote ends (e.g. mlag) but would also like to converge faster.
In almost all cases we'd like to age-out the remote entry for performance
and convergence reasons except when fast-leave is enabled. In that case we
want explicit immediate remote delete, thus add mdb flag which is set only
when the entry is being deleted due to fast-leave.
