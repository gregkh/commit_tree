drm/i915: Remove waiting & retiring from shrinker paths

i915_gem_wait_for_idle() and i915_retire_requests() introduce a
dependency on the timeline->mutex. This is problematic as we want to
later perform allocations underneath i915_active.mutex, forming a link
between the shrinker, the timeline and active mutexes. Nip this cycle in
the bud by removing the acquisition of the timeline mutex (i.e.
retiring) from inside the shrinker.
