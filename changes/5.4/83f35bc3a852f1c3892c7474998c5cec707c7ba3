drm/bridge: adv7511: Attach to DSI host at probe time

In contrast to all of the DSI panel drivers in drivers/gpu/drm/panel
which attach to the DSI host via mipi_dsi_attach() at probe time, the
ADV7533 bridge device does not. Instead it defers this to the point that
the upstream device connects to its bridge via drm_bridge_attach().
The generic Synopsys MIPI DSI host driver does not register it's own
drm_bridge until the MIPI DSI has attached. But it does not call
drm_bridge_attach() on the downstream device until the upstream device
has attached. This leads to a chicken and the egg failure and the DRM
pipeline does not complete.
Since all other mipi_dsi_device drivers call mipi_dsi_attach() in
probe(), make the adv7533 mipi_dsi_device do the same. This ensures that
the Synopsys MIPI DSI host registers it's bridge such that it is
available for the upstream device to connect to.
