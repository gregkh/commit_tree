coresight: tmc-etr: Decouple buffer sync and barrier packet insertion

If less space is available in the perf ring buffer than the ETR buffer,
barrier packets inserted in the trace stream by tmc_sync_etr_buf() are
skipped over when the head of the buffer is moved forward, resulting in
traces that can't be decoded.

This patch decouples the process of syncing ETR buffers and the addition
of barrier packets in order to perform the latter once the offset in the
trace buffer has been properly computed.
