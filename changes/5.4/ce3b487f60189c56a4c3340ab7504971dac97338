init/Kconfig: rework help of CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE

CONFIG_CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE was originally an independent boolean
option, but commit 877417e6ffb9 ("Kbuild: change CC_OPTIMIZE_FOR_SIZE
definition") turned it into a choice between _PERFORMANCE and _SIZE.

The phrase "If unsure, say N." sounds like an independent option.
Reword the help text to make it appropriate for the choice menu.
