opp: Return genpd virtual devices from dev_pm_opp_attach_genpd()

The cpufreq drivers don't need to do runtime PM operations on the
virtual devices returned by dev_pm_domain_attach_by_name() and so the
virtual devices weren't shared with the callers of
dev_pm_opp_attach_genpd() earlier.

But the IO device drivers would want to do that. This patch updates the
prototype of dev_pm_opp_attach_genpd() to accept another argument to
return the pointer to the array of genpd virtual devices.
