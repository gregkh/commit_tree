Revert "s390/dasd: Add discard support for ESE volumes"

This reverts commit 7e64db1597fe114b83fe17d0ba96c6aa5fca419a.

The thin provisioning feature introduces an IOCTL and the discard support
to allow userspace tools and filesystems to release unused and previously
allocated space respectively.

During some internal performance improvements and further tests, the
release of allocated space revealed some issues that may lead to data
corruption in some configurations when filesystems are mounted with
discard support enabled.

While we're working on a fix and trying to clarify the situation,
this commit reverts the discard support for ESE volumes to prevent
potential data corruption.
