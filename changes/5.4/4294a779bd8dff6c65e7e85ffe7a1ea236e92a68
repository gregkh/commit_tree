PM / devfreq: exynos-bus: Convert to use dev_pm_opp_set_rate()

Reuse opp core code for setting bus clock and voltage. As a side
effect this allow usage of coupled regulators feature (required
for boards using Exynos5422/5800 SoCs) because dev_pm_opp_set_rate()
uses regulator_set_voltage_triplet() for setting regulator voltage
while the old code used regulator_set_voltage_tol() with fixed
tolerance. This patch also removes no longer needed parsing of DT
property "exynos,voltage-tolerance" (no Exynos devfreq DT node uses
it). After applying changes both functions exynos_bus_passive_target()
and exynos_bus_target() have the same code, so remove
exynos_bus_passive_target(). In exynos_bus_probe() replace it with
exynos_bus_target.
