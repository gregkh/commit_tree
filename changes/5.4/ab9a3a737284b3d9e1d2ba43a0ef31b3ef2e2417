udf: reduce leakage of blocks related to named streams

Windows is capable of creating UDF files having named streams.
One example is the "Zone.Identifier" stream attached automatically
to files downloaded from a network. See:
  https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn392609.aspx

Modification of a file having one or more named streams in Linux causes
the stream directory to become detached from the file, essentially leaking
all blocks pertaining to the file's streams.

Fix by saving off information about an inode's streams when reading it,
for later use when its on-disk data is updated.
