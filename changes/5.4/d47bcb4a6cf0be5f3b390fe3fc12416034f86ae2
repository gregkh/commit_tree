serial: imx: fix data breakage on termios change

imx_set_termios(): avoid writing baud rate divider registers when the
values to be written are the same as current. Any writing seems to
restart transmission/receiving logic in the hardware, that leads to
data breakage even when rate doesn't in fact change. E.g., user
switches RTS/CTS handshake and suddenly gets broken bytes.
