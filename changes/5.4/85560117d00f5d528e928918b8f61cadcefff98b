loop: change queue block size to match when using DIO

The loop driver assumes that if the passed in fd is opened with
O_DIRECT, the caller wants to use direct I/O on the loop device.
However, if the underlying block device has a different block size than
the loop block queue, direct I/O can't be enabled. Instead of requiring
userspace to manually change the blocksize and re-enable direct I/O,
just change the queue block sizes to match, as well as the io_min size.
