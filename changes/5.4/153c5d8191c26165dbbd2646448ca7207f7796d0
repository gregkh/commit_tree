staging: wlan-ng: fix exit return when sme->key_idx >= NUM_WEPKEYS

Currently the exit return path when sme->key_idx >= NUM_WEPKEYS is via
label 'exit' and this checks if result is non-zero, however result has
not been initialized and contains garbage.  Fix this by replacing the
goto with a return with the error code.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Uninitialized scalar variable")
