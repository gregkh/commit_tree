xsk: remove AF_XDP socket from map when the socket is released

When an AF_XDP socket is released/closed the XSKMAP still holds a
reference to the socket in a "released" state. The socket will still
use the netdev queue resource, and block newly created sockets from
attaching to that queue, but no user application can access the
fill/complete/rx/tx queues. This results in that all applications need
to explicitly clear the map entry from the old "zombie state"
socket. This should be done automatically.

In this patch, the sockets tracks, and have a reference to, which maps
it resides in. When the socket is released, it will remove itself from
all maps.
