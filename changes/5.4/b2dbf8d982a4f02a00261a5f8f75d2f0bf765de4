drm/i915/blt: Remove recursive vma->lock

As we have already plugged the w->dma into the reservation_object, and
have set ourselves up to automatically signal the request and w->dma on
completion, we do not need to export the rq->fence directly and just use
the w->dma fence.

This avoids having to take the reservation_lock inside the worker which
cross-release lockdep would complain about. :)
