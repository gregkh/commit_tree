ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Do not disable FW notifications

As per FW team recommendation we should not disable notifications.
By default, all notifications are enabled in DSP firmware. These
notifications provide a vital information whenever an error occurs.

Currently, driver disables them during boot sequences. By doing so,
Skylake may silently ignore severe stream errors.
Correct that by removing permissive code.
