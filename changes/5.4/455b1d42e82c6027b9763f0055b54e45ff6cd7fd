ASoC: sunxi: Revert initial A83t support

This reverts commit 3e9acd7ac6933c (ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Remove
duplicated quirks structure").

It turns out that while one I2S controller is described in the A83t
datasheet, the driver supports another, undocumented, one that has been
inherited from the older SoCs, while the documented one uses the new
design.
