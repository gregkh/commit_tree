xen/efi: have a common runtime setup function

Today the EFI runtime functions are setup in architecture specific
code (x86 and arm), with the functions themselves living in drivers/xen
as they are not architecture dependent.

As the setup is exactly the same for arm and x86 move the setup to
drivers/xen, too. This at once removes the need to make the single
functions global visible.
