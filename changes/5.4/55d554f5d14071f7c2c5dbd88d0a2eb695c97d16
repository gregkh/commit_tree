tools: bpf: Use !building_out_of_srctree to determine srctree

make TARGETS=bpf kselftest fails with:

Makefile:127: tools/build/Makefile.include: No such file or directory

When the bpf tool make is invoked from tools Makefile, srctree is
cleared and the current logic check for srctree equals to empty
string to determine srctree location from CURDIR.

When the build in invoked from selftests/bpf Makefile, the srctree
is set to "." and the same logic used for srctree equals to empty is
needed to determine srctree.

Check building_out_of_srctree undefined as the condition for both
cases to fix "make TARGETS=bpf kselftest" build failure.
