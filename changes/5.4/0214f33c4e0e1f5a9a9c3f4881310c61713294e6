clk: Overwrite clk_hw::init with NULL during clk_register()

We don't want clk provider drivers to use the init structure after clk
registration time, but we leave a dangling reference to it by means of
clk_hw::init. Let's overwrite the member with NULL during clk_register()
so that this can't be used anymore after registration time.
