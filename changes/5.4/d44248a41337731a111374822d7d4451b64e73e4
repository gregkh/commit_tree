perf/core: Rework memory accounting in perf_mmap()

perf_mmap() always increases user->locked_vm. As a result, "extra" could
grow bigger than "user_extra", which doesn't make sense. Here is an
example case:

(Note: Assume "user_lock_limit" is very small.)

  | # of perf_mmap calls |vma->vm_mm->pinned_vm|user->locked_vm|
  | 0                    | 0                   | 0             |
  | 1                    | user_extra          | user_extra    |
  | 2                    | 3 * user_extra      | 2 * user_extra|
  | 3                    | 6 * user_extra      | 3 * user_extra|
  | 4                    | 10 * user_extra     | 4 * user_extra|

Fix this by maintaining proper user_extra and extra.
