drm/i915/guc: Remove client->submissions

The engine->guc_id is GuC FW defined and it is not guaranteed to be
below I915_NUM_ENGINES, so we shouldn't use it with the i915-defined
client->submissions, as we might overflow.
Instead of fixing it, just get rid of client->submissions, because the
information we get from it is not interesting anymore now that we only
have 1 client.
