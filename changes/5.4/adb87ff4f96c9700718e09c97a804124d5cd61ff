clocksource/drivers/hyperv: Allocate Hyper-V TSC page statically

Prepare to add Hyper-V sched clock callback and move Hyper-V Reference TSC
initialization much earlier in the boot process.  Earlier initialization is
needed so that it happens while the timestamp value is still 0 and no
discontinuity in the timestamp will occur when pv_ops.time.sched_clock
calculates its offset.
    
The earlier initialization requires that the Hyper-V TSC page be allocated
statically instead of with vmalloc(), so fixup the references to the TSC
page and the method of getting its physical address.
