clocksource/drivers/hyperv: Add Hyper-V specific sched clock function

Hyper-V guests use the default native_sched_clock() in
pv_ops.time.sched_clock on x86. But native_sched_clock() directly uses the
raw TSC value, which can be discontinuous in a Hyper-V VM.
    
Add the generic hv_setup_sched_clock() to set the sched clock function
appropriately. On x86, this sets pv_ops.time.sched_clock to read the
Hyper-V reference TSC value that is scaled and adjusted to be continuous.
    
Also move the Hyper-V reference TSC initialization much earlier in the boot
process so no discontinuity is observed when pv_ops.time.sched_clock
calculates its offset.
