usbip: tools: fix GCC8 warning for strncpy

GCC8 started emitting warning about using strncpy with number of bytes
exactly equal destination size which could lead to non-zero terminated
string being copied. Use "SYSFS_PATH_MAX - 1" & "SYSFS_BUS_ID_SIZE - 1"
as number of bytes to ensure name is always zero-terminated.
