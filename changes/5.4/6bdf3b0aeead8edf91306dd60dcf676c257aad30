csky: add missing brackets in a macro for tlb.h

As an earlier patch made the macro argument more complicated, compilation
now fails with:

 In file included from mm/madvise.c:30:
 mm/madvise.c: In function 'madvise_free_single_vma':
 arch/csky/include/asm/tlb.h:11:11: error:
     invalid type argument of '->' (have 'struct mmu_gather')
