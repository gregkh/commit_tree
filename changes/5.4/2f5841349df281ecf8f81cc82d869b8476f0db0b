ntp/y2038: Remove incorrect time_t truncation

A cast to 'time_t' was accidentally left in place during the
conversion of __do_adjtimex() to 64-bit timestamps, so the
resulting value is incorrectly truncated.

Remove the cast so the 64-bit time gets propagated correctly.

Fixes: ead25417f82e ("timex: use __kernel_timex internally")
