drm/i915/tgl: Updated Private PAT programming

Gen12 removes the target-cache and age fields from the private PAT
because MOCS now have the capability to set these itself. Only memory-type
field should be programmed in the ppat, the reminded bits are reserved.

Since now there are only 4 possible combinations, we could set only 4
PPAT and leave the reminded 4 as UC, but I left them as WB as we used
to have before.

Also these registers have been relocated to the 0x4800-0x481c range.
