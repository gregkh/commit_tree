iio: accel: adxl372: Fix/remove limitation for FIFO samples

Currently, the driver sets the FIFO_SAMPLES register with the number of
sample sets (maximum of 170 for 3 axis data, 256 for 2-axis and 512 for
single axis). However, the FIFO_SAMPLES register should store the number
of samples, regardless of how the FIFO format is configured.
