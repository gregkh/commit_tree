drm/amdgpu/powerplay: fix typo in mvdd table setup

Polaris and vegam use count for the value rather than
level.  This looks like a copy paste typo from when
the code was adapted from previous asics.

I'm not sure that the SMU actually uses this value, so
I don't know that it actually is a bug per se.
