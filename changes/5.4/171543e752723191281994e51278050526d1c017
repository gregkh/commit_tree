MIPS: Disallow CPU_SUPPORTS_HUGEPAGES for XPA,EVA

In preparation for 32-bit MIPS huge page support.

EVA,XPA are extended-addressing modes for 32-bit MIPS systems. Because
huge pages aren't currently supported in 32-bit MIPS, this doesn't take
any features away from EVA,XPA-enabled systems. However, the soon-to-
come 32-bit MIPS huge page support doesn't yet support them.

This also disables CPU_SUPPORTS_HUGEPAGES for the small number of 32-bit
MIPS CPUs from Alchemy/Netlogic that support a custom 36-bit extended
addressing. It's unknown if they even support huge pages in hardware.
