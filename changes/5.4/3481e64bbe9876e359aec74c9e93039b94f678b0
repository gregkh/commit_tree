bpf: add BTF ids in procfs for file descriptors to BTF objects

Implement the show_fdinfo hook for BTF FDs file operations, and make it
print the id of the BTF object. This allows for a quick retrieval of the
BTF id from its FD; or it can help understanding what type of object
(BTF) the file descriptor points to.

v2:
- Do not expose data_size, only btf_id, in FD info.
