scsi: virtio_scsi: implement request batching

Adding the command and kicking the virtqueue so far was done one after
another.  Make the kick optional, so that we can take into account
SCMD_LAST.  We also need a commit_rqs callback to kick the device if
blk-mq aborts the submission before the last request is reached.
