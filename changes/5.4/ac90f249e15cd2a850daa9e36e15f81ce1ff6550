io_uring: expose single mmap capability

After commit 75b28affdd6a we can get by with just a single mmap to
map both the sq and cq ring. However, userspace doesn't know that.

Add a features variable to io_uring_params, and notify userspace
that the kernel has this ability. This can then be used in liburing
(or in applications directly) to avoid the second mmap.
