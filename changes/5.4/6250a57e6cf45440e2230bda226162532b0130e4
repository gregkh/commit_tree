staging: rtl8723bs: Replace hal_btcoex_Initialize()

Remove hal_btcoex_Initialize as all it does is perform a memset and call
EXhalbtcoutsrc_InitlizeVariables.
Rename EXhalbtcoutsrc_InitlizeVariables to hal_btcoex_Initialize and add
the memset of hal_btcoex_Initialize in order to maintain compatibility
with call sites of the latter (EXhalbtcoutsrc is not called anywhere
else except in now-removed old hal_btcoex_Initialize).
Change return type of new hal_btcoex_Initialize from u8 to void and
remove its return statement as the return value of hal_btcoex_Initialize
is never used.
Change the type of function argument at call site to match the function
parameter of new hal_btcoex_Initialize.
