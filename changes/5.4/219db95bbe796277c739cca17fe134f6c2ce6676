ext4: documentation fixes

This commit aims to fix the following issues in ext4 documentation:
- Flexible block group docs said that the aim was to group block
  metadata together instead of block group metadata.
- The documentation consistly uses "location" instead of "block number".
  It is easy to confuse location to be an absolute offset on disk. Added
  a line to clarify all location values are in terms of block numbers.
- Dirent2 docs said that the rec_len field is shortened instead of the
  name_len field.
- Typo in bg_checksum description.
- Inode size is 160 bytes now, and hence i_extra_isize is now 32.
- Cluster size formula was incorrect, it did not include the +10 to
  s_log_cluster_size value.
- Typo: there were two s_wtime_hi in the superblock struct.
- Superblock struct was outdated, added the new fields which were part
  of s_reserved earlier.
- Multiple mount protection seems to be implemented in fs/ext4/mmp.c.
