USB: dummy-hcd: fix power budget for SuperSpeed mode

The power budget for SuperSpeed mode should be 900 mA
according to USB specification, so set the power budget
to 900mA for dummy_start_ss which is only used for
SuperSpeed mode.

If the max power consumption of SuperSpeed device is
larger than 500 mA, insufficient available bus power
error happens in usb_choose_configuration function
when the device connects to dummy hcd.
