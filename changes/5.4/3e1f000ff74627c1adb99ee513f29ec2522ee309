IB/mlx5: Support per device q counters in switchdev mode

When parent mlx5_core_dev is in switchdev mode, q_counters are not
applicable to multiple non uplink vports.
Hence, have make them limited to device level.

While at it, correct __mlx5_ib_qp_set_counter() and
__mlx5_ib_modify_qp() to use u16 set_id as defined by the device.
