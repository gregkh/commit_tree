io_uring: used cached copies of sq->dropped and cq->overflow

We currently use the ring values directly, but that can lead to issues
if the application is malicious and changes these values on our behalf.
Created in-kernel cached versions of them, and just overwrite the user
side when we update them. This is similar to how we treat the sq/cq
ring tail/head updates.
