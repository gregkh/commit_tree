media: omap_vout: fix various v4l2-compliance failures

This patch fixes the following v4l2-compliance failures:

- FIELD_ANY could be returned, which is not allowed.
- JPEG colorspace was set instead of SRGB.
- No control events.
- Empty bus_info in QUERYCAP.
- Overlay format handling wasn't zeroing bitmap/clips and
  didn't return the chromakey correctly.
- G_FBUF didn't fill in many of the v4l2_framebuffer values.
  Now also return the base address of the corresponding
  framebuffer that this overlays.
- Missing ENUM/G/S_OUTPUT ioctls.
- ROTATE/VFLIP controls were added when the HW didn't support them.

With these changes 'v4l2-compliance' passes all non-streaming tests.

Tested on a Pandaboard and a Beagle XM board.
