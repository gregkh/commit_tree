net: phy: fix write to mii-ctrl1000 register

When userspace writes to the MII_ADVERTISE register, we update phylib's
advertising mask and trigger a renegotiation.  However, writing to the
MII_CTRL1000 register, which contains the gigabit advertisement, does
neither.  This can lead to phylib's copy of the advertisement becoming
de-synced with the values in the PHY register set, which can result in
incorrect negotiation resolution.
