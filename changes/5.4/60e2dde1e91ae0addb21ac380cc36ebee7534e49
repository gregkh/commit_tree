led: triggers: Fix a memory leak bug

In led_trigger_set(), 'event' is allocated in kasprintf(). However, it is
not deallocated in the following execution if the label 'err_activate' or
'err_add_groups' is entered, leading to memory leaks. To fix this issue,
free 'event' before returning the error.
