thunderbolt: Fix lockdep circular locking depedency warning

When lockdep is enabled, plugging Thunderbolt dock on Dominik's laptop
triggers following splat:

  ======================================================

  but task is already holding lock:

  which lock already depends on the new lock.

On an system using ACPI hotplug the host router gets hotplugged first and then
the firmware starts sending notifications about connected devices so the above
scenario should not happen in reality. However, after taking a second
look at commit a03e828915c0 ("thunderbolt: Serialize PCIe tunnel
creation with PCI rescan") that introduced the locking, I don't think it
is actually correct. It may have cured the symptom but probably the real
root cause was somewhere closer to PCI stack and possibly is already
fixed with recent kernels. I also tried to reproduce the original issue
with the commit reverted but could not.

So to keep lockdep happy and the code bit less complex drop calls to
pci_lock_rescan_remove()/pci_unlock_rescan_remove() in
tb_switch_set_authorized() effectively reverting a03e828915c0.
