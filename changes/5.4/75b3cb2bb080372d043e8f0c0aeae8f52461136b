habanalabs: add uapi to retrieve device utilization

Users and sysadmins usually want to know what is the device utilization as
a level 0 indication if they are efficiently using the device.

Add a new opcode to the INFO IOCTL that will return the device utilization
over the last period of 100-1000ms. The return value is 0-100,
representing as percentage the total utilization rate.
