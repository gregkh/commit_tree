ASoC: sun4i-i2s: Fix LRCK and BCLK polarity offsets on newer SoCs

The LRCK and BCLK polarity offsets on newer SoCs has been
changed, yet the driver didn't take it into account for all of them.

This was taken into account for the H3, but not the A83t. This was handled
using a reg_field for the H3.

However, the value in that field will not be the same, so reg_field is not
adapted in that case. Let's change for proper calls with the regular
values.
