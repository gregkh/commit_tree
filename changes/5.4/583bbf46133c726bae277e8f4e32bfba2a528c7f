drm/panfrost: Use drm_gem_map_offset()

panfrost_ioctl_mmap_bo() contains a reimplementation of
drm_gem_map_offset() but with a bug - it allows mapping imported
objects (without going through the exporter). Fix this by switching to
use the newly renamed drm_gem_map_offset() function instead which has
the bonus of simplifying the code.
