powerpc/fadump: support holes in kernel boot memory area

With support to copy multiple kernel boot memory regions owing to copy
size limitation, also handle holes in the memory area to be preserved.
Support as many as 128 kernel boot memory regions. This allows having
an adequate FADump capture kernel size for different scenarios.
