tracing: Add locked_down checks to the open calls of files created for tracefs

Added various checks on open tracefs calls to see if tracefs is in lockdown
mode, and if so, to return -EPERM.

Note, the event format files (which are basically standard on all machines)
as well as the enabled_functions file (which shows what is currently being
traced) are not lockde down. Perhaps they should be, but it seems counter
intuitive to lockdown information to help you know if the system has been
modified.
