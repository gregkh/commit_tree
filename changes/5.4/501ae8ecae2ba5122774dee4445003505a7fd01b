fuse: reserve byteswapped init opcodes

virtio fs tunnels fuse over a virtio channel.  One issue is two sides might
be speaking different endian-ness. To detects this, host side looks at the
opcode value in the FUSE_INIT command.  Works fine at the moment but might
fail if a future version of fuse will use such an opcode for
initialization.  Let's reserve this opcode so we remember and don't do
this.

Same for CUSE_INIT.
