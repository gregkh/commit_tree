powerpc/pseries/iommu: Switch to xchg_no_kill

This is the last implementation of iommu_table_ops::exchange() which
we are about to remove.

This implements xchg_no_kill() for pseries. Since it is paravirtual
platform, the hypervisor does TCE invalidations and we do not have
to deal with it here, hence no tce_kill() hook.
