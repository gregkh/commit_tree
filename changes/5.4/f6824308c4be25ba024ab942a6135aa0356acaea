bnxt_en: Avoid disabling pci device in bnxt_remove_one() for already disabled device.

With the recently added error recovery logic, the device may already
be disabled if the firmware recovery is unsuccessful.  In
bnxt_remove_one(), check that the device is still enabled first
before calling pci_disable_device().
