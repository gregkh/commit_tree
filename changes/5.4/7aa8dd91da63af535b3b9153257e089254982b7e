devicetree: Expose dtbs_check and dt_binding_check some more

It wasn't obvious that this was a command to run based on 'make help',
so add it to the top-level help for devicetree builds. Also, add an
example to the documentation to show that db_binding_check can be run
with DT_SCHEMA_FILES= to only check one schema file instead of all of
them.
