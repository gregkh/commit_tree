mmc: renesas_sdhi_sys_dmac: Remove all R-Car Gen3 SoCs

All R-Car Gen3 SoCs with any ES version cannot use this DMAC actually.
So, this patch removes the compatibles of R-Car Gen3 SoCs from
renesas_sdhi_sys_dmac_of_match. Since the previous code has
an empty whitelist to prevent probing of R-Car Gen3 SoCs,
no behavior changes.
