drm/panfrost: Rework page table flushing and runtime PM interaction

There is no point in resuming the h/w just to do flush operations and
doing so takes several locks which cause lockdep issues with the shrinker.
Rework the flush operations to only happen when the h/w is already awake.
This avoids taking any locks associated with resuming which trigger
lockdep warnings.
