tracing/probe: Reject exactly same probe event

Reject exactly same probe events as existing probes.

Multiprobe allows user to define multiple probes on same
event. If user appends a probe which exactly same definition
(same probe address and same arguments) on existing event,
the event will record same probe information twice.
That can be confusing users, so reject it.
