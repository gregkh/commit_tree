scsi: fnic: print port speed only at driver init or speed change

Port speed printing was added by commit d948e6383ec3 ("scsi: fnic: Add port
speed stat to fnic debug stats"). As currently configured, this will cause
the port speed to be printed to syslog every 2 seconds. To prevent log
spamming, only print the vnic port speed at driver initialization and if
the speed changes. Also clean up a small typo in fnic_trace.c.
