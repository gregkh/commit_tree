cifs: get mode bits from special sid on stat

When mounting with "modefromsid" retrieve mode bits from
special SID (S-1-5-88-3) on stat.  Subsequent patch will fix
setattr (chmod) to save mode bits in S-1-5-88-3-<mode>

Note that when an ACE matching S-1-5-88-3 is not found, we
default the mode to an approximation based on the owner, group
and everyone permissions (as with the "cifsacl" mount option).
