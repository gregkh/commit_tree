KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Make function comments match function declarations

Since commit 503a62862e8f ("KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Rely on the GIC driver to
parse the firmware tables"), the vgic_v{2,3}_probe functions stopped using
a DT node. Commit 909777324588 ("KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-new: vgic_init:
implement kvm_vgic_hyp_init") changed the functions again, and now they
require exactly one argument, a struct gic_kvm_info populated by the GIC
driver. Unfortunately the comments regressed and state that a DT node is
used instead. Change the function comments to reflect the current
prototypes.
