nvme-rdma: fix a segmentation fault during module unload

In case there are controllers that are not associated with any RDMA
device (e.g. during unsuccessful reconnection) and the user will unload
the module, these controllers will not be freed and will access already
freed memory. The same logic appears in other fabric drivers as well.
