drm/i915: Lock the engine while dumping the active request

We cannot let the request be retired and freed while we are trying to
dump it during error capture. It is not sufficient just to grab a
reference to the request, as during retirement we may free the ring
which we are also dumping. So take the engine lock to prevent retiring
and freeing of the request.
