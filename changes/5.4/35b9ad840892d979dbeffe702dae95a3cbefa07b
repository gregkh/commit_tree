ACPI: HMAT: ACPI_HMAT_MEMORY_PD_VALID is deprecated since ACPI-6.3

ACPI-6.3 corresponds to when HMAT revision was bumped
from 1 to 2. In this version ACPI_HMAT_MEMORY_PD_VALID
was deprecated and made reserved.

As such in revision 2+ we shouldn't be testing this flag.

This is as per ACPI-6.3, 5.2.27.3, Table 5-145
"Memory Proximity Domain Attributes Structure"
for Flags.
