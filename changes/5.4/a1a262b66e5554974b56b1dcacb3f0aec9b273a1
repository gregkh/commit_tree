dm crypt: switch to ESSIV crypto API template

Replace the explicit ESSIV handling in the dm-crypt driver with calls
into the crypto API, which now possesses the capability to perform
this processing within the crypto subsystem.

Note that we reorder the AEAD cipher_api string parsing with the TFM
instantiation: this is needed because cipher_api is mangled by the
ESSIV handling, and throws off the parsing of "authenc(" otherwise.
