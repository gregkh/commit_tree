KVM: x86: Fix x86_decode_insn() return when fetching insn bytes fails

Jump to the common error handling in x86_decode_insn() if
__do_insn_fetch_bytes() fails so that its error code is converted to the
appropriate return type.  Although the various helpers used by
x86_decode_insn() return X86EMUL_* values, x86_decode_insn() itself
returns EMULATION_FAILED or EMULATION_OK.

This doesn't cause a functional issue as the sole caller,
x86_emulate_instruction(), currently only cares about success vs.
failure, and success is indicated by '0' for both types
(X86EMUL_CONTINUE and EMULATION_OK).
