ASoC: soc-component: move snd_soc_component_stream_event()

Current soc-dapm / soc-core are using a long way round to call
.stream_event.

	if (driver->stream_event)
		dapm->stream_event = ...;
	...
	if (dapm->stream_event)
		ret = dapm->stream_event(...);

We can directly call it via driver->stream_event.
One note here is that both Card and Component have dapm,
but, Card's dapm doesn't have dapm->component.
We need to check it.

This patch moves snd_soc_component_stream_event() to soc-component.c
and updates parameters.
dapm->stream_event is no longer needed
