riscv: tlbflush: remove confusing comment on local_flush_tlb_all()

Remove a confusing comment on our local_flush_tlb_all()
implementation.  Per an internal discussion with Andrew, while it's
true that the fence.i is not necessary, it's not the case that an
sfence.vma implies a fence.i.  We also drop the section about
"flush[ing] the entire local TLB" to better align with the language in
section 4.2.1 "Supervisor Memory-Management Fence Instruction" of the
RISC-V Privileged Specification v20190608.
