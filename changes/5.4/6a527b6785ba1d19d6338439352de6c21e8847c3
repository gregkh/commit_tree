riscv: init: merge split string literals in preprocessor directive

sparse complains loudly when string literals associated with
preprocessor directives are split into multiple, separately quoted
strings across different lines:

arch/riscv/mm/init.c:341:9: error: Expected ; at the end of type declaration
arch/riscv/mm/init.c:341:9: error: got "not use absolute addressing."
arch/riscv/mm/init.c:358:9: error: Trying to use reserved word 'do' as identifier
arch/riscv/mm/init.c:358:9: error: Expected ; at end of declaration
[ ... ]

It turns out this doesn't compile.  The existing Linux practice for
this situation is simply to use a single long line.  So, fix by
concatenating the strings.

This patch should have no functional impact.

This version incorporates changes based on feedback from Luc Van
