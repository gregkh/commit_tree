powerpc/powernv/ioda: Fix race in TCE level allocation

pnv_tce() returns a pointer to a TCE entry and originally a TCE table
would be pre-allocated. For the default case of 2GB window the table
needs only a single level and that is fine. However if more levels are
requested, it is possible to get a race when 2 threads want a pointer
to a TCE entry from the same page of TCEs.

This adds cmpxchg to handle the race. Note that once TCE is non-zero,
it cannot become zero again.
