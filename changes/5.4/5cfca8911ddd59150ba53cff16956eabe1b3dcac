soc: fsl: qe: support fsl,qe-snums property

Add driver support for the newly introduced fsl,qe-snums property.

Conveniently, of_property_read_variable_u8_array does exactly what we
need: If the property fsl,qe-snums is found (and has an allowed size),
the array of values get copied to snums, and the return value is the
number of snums - we cannot assign directly to num_of_snums, since we
need to check whether the return value is negative.
