KVM: nVMX: Fix consistency check on injected exception error code

Current versions of Intel's SDM incorrectly state that "bits 31:15 of
the VM-Entry exception error-code field" must be zero.  In reality, bits
31:16 must be zero, i.e. error codes are 16-bit values.

The bogus error code check manifests as an unexpected VM-Entry failure
due to an invalid code field (error number 7) in L1, e.g. when injecting
a #GP with error_code=0x9f00.

Nadav previously reported the bug[*], both to KVM and Intel, and fixed
the associated kvm-unit-test.
