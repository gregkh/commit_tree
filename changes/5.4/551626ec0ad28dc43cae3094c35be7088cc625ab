ALSA: hda/hdmi - Don't report spurious jack state changes

The HDMI jack handling reports the state change always via
snd_jack_report() whenever hdmi_present_sense() is called, even if the
state itself doesn't change from the previous time.  This is mostly
harmless but still a bit confusing to user-space.

This patch reduces such spurious jack state changes and reports only
when the state really changed.  Also, as a minor optimization, avoid
overwriting the pin ELD data when the state is identical.
