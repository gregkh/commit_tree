perf annotate: Propagate the symbol__annotate() error return

We were just returning -1 in symbol__annotate() when symbol__annotate()
failed, propagate its error as it is used later to pass to
symbol__strerror_disassemble() to present a error message to the user,
that in some cases were getting:

  "Invalid -1 error code"

Fix it to propagate the error.
