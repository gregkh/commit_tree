fs-verity: add SHA-512 support

Add SHA-512 support to fs-verity.  This is primarily a demonstration of
the trivial changes needed to support a new hash algorithm in fs-verity;
most users will still use SHA-256, due to the smaller space required to
store the hashes.  But some users may prefer SHA-512.
