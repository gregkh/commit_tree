netfilter: drop bridge nf reset from nf_reset

commit 174e23810cd31
("sk_buff: drop all skb extensions on free and skb scrubbing") made napi
recycle always drop skb extensions.  The additional skb_ext_del() that is
performed via nf_reset on napi skb recycle is not needed anymore.

Most nf_reset() calls in the stack are there so queued skb won't block
'rmmod nf_conntrack' indefinitely.

This removes the skb_ext_del from nf_reset, and renames it to a more
fitting nf_reset_ct().

In a few selected places, add a call to skb_ext_reset to make sure that
no active extensions remain.

I am submitting this for "net", because we're still early in the release
cycle.  The patch applies to net-next too, but I think the rename causes
needless divergence between those trees.
