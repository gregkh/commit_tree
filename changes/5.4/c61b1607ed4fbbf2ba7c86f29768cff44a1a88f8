crypto: arm/aes-ce - implement ciphertext stealing for XTS

Update the AES-XTS implementation based on AES instructions so that it
can deal with inputs whose size is not a multiple of the cipher block
size. This is part of the original XTS specification, but was never
implemented before in the Linux kernel.
