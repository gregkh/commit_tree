x86/pci: Pass lockdep condition to pcm_mmcfg_list iterator

The pcm_mmcfg_list is traversed by list_for_each_entry_rcu() outside
of an RCU read-side critical section, which is safe because the
pci_mmcfg_lock is held.  This commit therefore adds a lockdep expression
to list_for_each_entry_rcu() in order t avoid lockdep warnings.
