hrtimer: Move unmarked hrtimers to soft interrupt expiry on RT

On PREEMPT_RT not all hrtimers can be expired in hard interrupt context
even if that is perfectly fine on a PREEMPT_RT=n kernel, e.g. because they
take regular spinlocks. Also for latency reasons PREEMPT_RT tries to defer
most hrtimers' expiry into softirq context.

hrtimers marked with HRTIMER_MODE_HARD must be kept in hard interrupt
context expiry mode. Add the required logic.

No functional change for PREEMPT_RT=n kernels.
