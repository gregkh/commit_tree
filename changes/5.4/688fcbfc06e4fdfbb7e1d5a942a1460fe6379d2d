mm/vmalloc: modify struct vmap_area to reduce its size

Objective
---------

The current implementation of struct vmap_area wasted space.

After applying this commit, sizeof(struct vmap_area) has been
reduced from 11 words to 8 words.

Description
-----------

1) Pack "subtree_max_size", "vm" and "purge_list".  This is no problem
   because

A) "subtree_max_size" is only used when vmap_area is in "free" tree

B) "vm" is only used when vmap_area is in "busy" tree

C) "purge_list" is only used when vmap_area is in vmap_purge_list

2) Eliminate "flags".

;Since only one flag VM_VM_AREA is being used, and the same thing can be
done by judging whether "vm" is NULL, then the "flags" can be eliminated.
