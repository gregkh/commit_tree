ice: Treat DCBx state NOT_STARTED as valid

When a port is not cabled, but DCBx is enabled in the
firmware, the status of DCBx will be NOT_STARTED.  This
is a valid state for FW enabled and should not be
treated as a is_fw_lldp true automatically.

Add the code to treat NOT_STARTED as another valid state.
