nl80211: Add support for EDMG channels

802.11ay specification defines Enhanced Directional Multi-Gigabit
(EDMG) STA and AP which allow channel bonding of 2 channels and more.

Introduce new NL attributes that are needed for enabling and
configuring EDMG support.

Two new attributes are used by kernel to publish driver's EDMG
capabilities to the userspace:
NL80211_BAND_ATTR_EDMG_CHANNELS - bitmap field that indicates the 2.16
GHz channel(s) that are supported by the driver.
When this attribute is not set it means driver does not support EDMG.
NL80211_BAND_ATTR_EDMG_BW_CONFIG - represent the channel bandwidth
configurations supported by the driver.

Additional two new attributes are used by the userspace for connect
command and for AP configuration:
NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_EDMG_CHANNELS
NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_EDMG_BW_CONFIG

New rate info flag - RATE_INFO_FLAGS_EDMG, can be reported from driver
and used for bitrate calculation that will take into account EDMG
according to the 802.11ay specification.
