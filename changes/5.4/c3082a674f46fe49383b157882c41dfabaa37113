PM: QoS: Get rid of unused flags

The network_latency and network_throughput flags for PM-QoS have not
found much use in drivers or in userspace since they were introduced.

Commit 4a733ef1bea7 ("mac80211: remove PM-QoS listener") removed the
only user PM_QOS_NETWORK_LATENCY in the kernel a while ago and there
don't seem to be any userspace tools using the character device files
either.

PM_QOS_MEMORY_BANDWIDTH was never even added to the trace events.

Remove all the flags except cpu_dma_latency.
