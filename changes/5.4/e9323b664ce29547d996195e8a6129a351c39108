clk: samsung: exynos5420: Preserve PLL configuration during suspend/resume

Properly save and restore all top PLL related configuration registers
during suspend/resume cycle. So far driver only handled EPLL and RPLL
clocks, all other were reset to default values after suspend/resume cycle.
This caused for example lower G3D (MALI Panfrost) performance after system
resume, even if performance governor has been selected.
