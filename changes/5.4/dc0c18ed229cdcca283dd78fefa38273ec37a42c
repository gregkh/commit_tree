mac80211: fix scan when operating on DFS channels in ETSI domains

In non-ETSI regulatory domains scan is blocked when operating channel
is a DFS channel. For ETSI, however, once DFS channel is marked as
available after the CAC, this channel will remain available (for some
time) even after leaving this channel.

Therefore a scan can be done without any impact on the availability
of the DFS channel as no new CAC is required after the scan.

Enable scan in mac80211 in these cases.
