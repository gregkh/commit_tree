drivers/base/memory.c: don't access uninitialized memmaps in soft_offline_page_store()

Uninitialized memmaps contain garbage and in the worst case trigger kernel
BUGs, especially with CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING.  They should not get touched.

Right now, when trying to soft-offline a PFN that resides on a memory
block that was never onlined, one gets a misleading error with
CONFIG_PAGE_POISONING:

  :/# echo 5637144576 > /sys/devices/system/memory/soft_offline_page
  [   23.097167] soft offline: 0x150000 page already poisoned

But the actual result depends on the garbage in the memmap.

soft_offline_page() can only work with online pages, it returns -EIO in
case of ZONE_DEVICE.  Make sure to only forward pages that are online
(iow, managed by the buddy) and, therefore, have an initialized memmap.

Add a check against pfn_to_online_page() and similarly return -EIO.
