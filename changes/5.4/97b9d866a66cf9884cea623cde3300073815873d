perf srcline: Add missing srcline.h header to files needing its defs

When srcline was introduced it wrongly added the include to util/sort.h,
even with that header not needing the definitions it provides, fix it by
adding it to the places that need it as a pre patch to remove srcline.h
from sort.h.
