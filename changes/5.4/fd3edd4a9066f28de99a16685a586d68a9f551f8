KVM: nVMX: cleanup and fix host 64-bit mode checks

KVM was incorrectly checking vmcs12->host_ia32_efer even if the "load
IA32_EFER" exit control was reset.  Also, some checks were not using
the new CC macro for tracing.

Cleanup everything so that the vCPU's 64-bit mode is determined
directly from EFER_LMA and the VMCS checks are based on that, which
matches section 26.2.4 of the SDM.
