mm,thp: avoid writes to file with THP in pagecache

In previous patch, an application could put part of its text section in
THP via madvise().  These THPs will be protected from writes when the
application is still running (TXTBSY).  However, after the application
exits, the file is available for writes.

This patch avoids writes to file THP by dropping page cache for the file
when the file is open for write.  A new counter nr_thps is added to struct
address_space.  In do_dentry_open(), if the file is open for write and
nr_thps is non-zero, we drop page cache for the whole file.
