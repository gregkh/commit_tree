ARM: OMAP2+: Plug in device_enable/idle ops for IOMMUs

The OMAP IOMMU driver requires the device_enable/idle platform
data ops on all the IOMMU devices to be able to enable and disable
the clocks after commit db8918f61d51 ("iommu/omap: streamline
enable/disable through runtime pm callbacks"). Plug in these
pdata ops for all the existing IOMMUs through pdata quirks to
maintain functionality.
