perf/x86/cstate: Add Comet Lake CPU support

Comet Lake is the new 10th Gen Intel processor. From the perspective of
Intel cstate residency counters, there is nothing changed compared with
Kaby Lake.

Share hswult_cstates with Kaby Lake.
Update the comments for Comet Lake.
Kaby Lake is missed in the comments for some Residency Counters. Update
the comments for Kaby Lake as well.

The External Design Specification (EDS) is not published yet. It comes
from an authoritative internal source.

The patch has been tested on real hardware.
