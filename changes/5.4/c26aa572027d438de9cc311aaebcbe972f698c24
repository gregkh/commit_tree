nvme: Treat discovery subsystems as unique subsystems

Current code matches subnqn and collapses all controllers to the
same subnqn to a single subsystem structure. This is good for
recognizing multiple controllers for the same subsystem. But with
the well-known discovery subnqn, the subsystems aren't truly the
same subsystem. As such, subsystem specific rules, such as no
overlap of controller id, do not apply. With today's behavior, the
check for overlap of controller id can fail, preventing the new
discovery controller from being created.

When searching for like subsystem nqn, exclude the discovery nqn
from matching. This will result in each discovery controller being
attached to a unique subsystem structure.
