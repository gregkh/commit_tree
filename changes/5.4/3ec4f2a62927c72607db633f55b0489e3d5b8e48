fscrypt: refactor key setup code in preparation for v2 policies

Do some more refactoring of the key setup code, in preparation for
introducing a filesystem-level keyring and v2 encryption policies:

- Now that ci_inode exists, don't pass around the inode unnecessarily.

- Define a function setup_file_encryption_key() which handles the crypto
  key setup given an under-construction fscrypt_info.  Don't pass the
  fscrypt_context, since everything is in the fscrypt_info.
  [This will be extended for v2 policies and the fs-level keyring.]

- Define a function fscrypt_set_derived_key() which sets the per-file
  key, without depending on anything specific to v1 policies.
  [This will also be used for v2 policies.]

- Define a function fscrypt_setup_v1_file_key() which takes the raw
  master key, thus separating finding the key from using it.
  [This will also be used if the key is found in the fs-level keyring.]
