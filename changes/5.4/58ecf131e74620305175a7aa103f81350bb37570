USB: ldusb: fix NULL-derefs on driver unbind

The driver was using its struct usb_interface pointer as an inverted
disconnected flag, but was setting it to NULL before making sure all
completion handlers had run. This could lead to a NULL-pointer
dereference in a number of dev_dbg, dev_warn and dev_err statements in
the completion handlers which relies on said pointer.

Fix this by unconditionally stopping all I/O and preventing
resubmissions by poisoning the interrupt URBs at disconnect and using a
dedicated disconnected flag.

This also makes sure that all I/O has completed by the time the
disconnect callback returns.
