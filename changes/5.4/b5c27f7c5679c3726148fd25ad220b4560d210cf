powerpc/64s/exception: machine check pseries should always run the early handler

Now that pseries with fwnmi registered runs the early machine check
handler, there is no good reason to special case the non-fwnmi case
and skip the early handler. Reducing the code and number of paths is
a top priority for asm code, it's better to handle this in C where
possible (and the pseries early handler is a no-op if fwnmi is not
registered).
