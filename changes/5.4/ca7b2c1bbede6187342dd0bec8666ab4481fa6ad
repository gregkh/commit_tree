drm/i915/uc: Move intel functions to intel_uc

All the intel_uc_* can now be moved to work on the intel_uc structure
for better encapsulation of uc-related actions.

Note: I've introduced uc_to_gt instead of uc_to_i915 because the aim is
to move everything to be gt-focused in the medium term, so we would've
had to replace it soon anyway.
