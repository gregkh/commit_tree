kbuild: Inform user to pass ARCH= for make mrproper only when necessary

Since commit 3a475b2166fd ("kbuild: Inform user to pass ARCH= for make
mrproper"), if you try out-of-tree build with an unclean source tree,
it suggests to run 'make ARCH=<ARCH> mrproper'.

This looks odd when you are not cross-compiling the kernel. Show the
'ARCH=<ARCH>' part only when ARCH= was given from the command line.
If ARCH is the default (native build) or came from the environment,
it should simply suggest 'make mrproper' as before.
