mtd: spi-nor: Add a ->convert_addr() method

In order to separate manufacturer quirks from the core we need to get
rid of all the manufacturer specific flags, like the
SNOR_F_S3AN_ADDR_DEFAULT one.

This can easily be replaced by a ->convert_addr() hook, which when
implemented will provide the core with an easy way to convert an
absolute address into something the flash understands.

Right now the only user are the S3AN chips, but other manufacturers
can implement it if needed.
