scsi: ufs-bsg: Wake the device before sending raw upiu commands

The scsi async probe process is calling blk_pm_runtime_init for each lun,
and then those request queues are monitored by the block layer pm
engine (blk-pm.c).  This is however, not the case for scsi-passthrough
queues, created by bsg_setup_queue().

So the ufs-bsg driver might send various commands, disregarding the pm
status of the device. This is wrong, regardless if its request queue is
pm-aware or not.
