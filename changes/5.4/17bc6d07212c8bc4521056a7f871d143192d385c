ice: Move vector base setup to PF VSI

When interrupt tracking was refactored, during rebuild, the call to
ice_vsi_setup_vector_base() was inadvertently removed from the PF VSI
instead of being removed from the VF VSI. During reset, the failure to
properly setup the vector base generates a call trace. Correct this so
that resets/rebuilds properly complete.
