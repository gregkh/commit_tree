mm, reclaim: cleanup should_continue_reclaim()

After commit "mm, reclaim: make should_continue_reclaim perform dryrun
detection", closer look at the function shows, that nr_reclaimed == 0
means the function will always return false.  And since non-zero
nr_reclaimed implies non_zero nr_scanned, testing nr_scanned serves no
purpose, and so does the testing for __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL.

This patch thus cleans up the function to test only !nr_reclaimed upfront,
and remove the __GFP_RETRY_MAYFAIL test and nr_scanned parameter
completely.  Comment is also updated, explaining that approximating "full
LRU list has been scanned" with nr_scanned == 0 didn't really work.
