vfio-mdev/mtty: Simplify interrupt generation

While generating interrupt, mdev_state is already available for which
interrupt is generated.
Instead of doing indirect way from state->device->uuid-> to searching
state linearly in linked list on every interrupt generation,
directly use the available state.

Hence, simplify the code to use mdev_state and remove unused helper
function with that.
