drm/i915: Check for a second VCS engine more carefully

To use the legacy BSD selector, you must have a second VCS engine, or
else the ABI simply maps the request for another engine onto VCS0.
However, we only checked a single VCS1 location and overlooking the
possibility of a sparse VCS set being mapped to the dense ABI.

v2: num_vcs_engines() turns out to be reusable and futureproof it so we
never have to worry about this silly bit of ABI again!
