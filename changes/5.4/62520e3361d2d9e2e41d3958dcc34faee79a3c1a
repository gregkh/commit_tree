drm/i915: Move tasklet kicking to __i915_request_queue caller

Since __i915_request_queue() may be called from hardirq (timer) context,
we cannot use local_bh_disable/enable at the lower level. As we do want
to kick the tasklet to speed up initial submission or preemption for
normal client submission, lift it to the normal process context
callpath.
