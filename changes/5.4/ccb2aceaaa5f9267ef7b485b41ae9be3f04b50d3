drm/i915: use vfuncs for reg_read/write_fw_domains

Instead of going through the if-else chain every time, let's save the
function in the uncore structure. Note that the new functions are
purposely not used from the reg read/write functions to keep the
inlining there.

While at it, use the new macro to call the old ones to clean the code a
bit.
