arm64: mm: Introduce vabits_actual

In order to support 52-bit kernel addresses detectable at boot time, one
needs to know the actual VA_BITS detected. A new variable vabits_actual
is introduced in this commit and employed for the KVM hypervisor layout,
KASAN, fault handling and phys-to/from-virt translation where there
would normally be compile time constants.

In order to maintain performance in phys_to_virt, another variable
physvirt_offset is introduced.
