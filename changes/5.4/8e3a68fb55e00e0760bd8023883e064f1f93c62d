dma-mapping: make dma_atomic_pool_init self-contained

The memory allocated for the atomic pool needs to have the same
mapping attributes that we use for remapping, so use
pgprot_dmacoherent instead of open coding it.  Also deduct a
suitable zone to allocate the memory from based on the presence
of the DMA zones.
