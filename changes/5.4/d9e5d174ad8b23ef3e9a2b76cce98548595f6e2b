can: kvaser_usb: Use struct_size() in alloc_candev()

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct foo {
    int stuff;
    void *entry[];
};

instance = alloc(sizeof(struct foo) + count * sizeof(void *));

Instead of leaving these open-coded and prone to type mistakes, we can
now use the new struct_size() helper:

instance = alloc(struct_size(instance, entry, count));
