sched/uclamp: Use TG's clamps to restrict TASK's clamps

When a task specific clamp value is configured via sched_setattr(2), this
value is accounted in the corresponding clamp bucket every time the task is
{en,de}qeued. However, when cgroups are also in use, the task specific
clamp values could be restricted by the task_group (TG) clamp values.

Update uclamp_cpu_inc() to aggregate task and TG clamp values. Every time a
task is enqueued, it's accounted in the clamp bucket tracking the smaller
clamp between the task specific value and its TG effective value. This
allows to:

1. ensure cgroup clamps are always used to restrict task specific requests,
   i.e. boosted not more than its TG effective protection and capped at
   least as its TG effective limit.

2. implement a "nice-like" policy, where tasks are still allowed to request
   less than what enforced by their TG effective limits and protections

Do this by exploiting the concept of "effective" clamp, which is already
used by a TG to track parent enforced restrictions.

Apply task group clamp restrictions only to tasks belonging to a child
group. While, for tasks in the root group or in an autogroup, system
defaults are still enforced.
