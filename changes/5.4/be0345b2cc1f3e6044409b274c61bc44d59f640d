phy: qualcomm: phy-qcom-qmp: Add of_node_put() before return

Each iteration of for_each_available_child_of_node() puts the previous
node, but in the case of a return from the middle of the loop, there is
no put, thus causing a memory leak. Hence create a new label,
err_node_put, that puts the previous node (child) before returning the
required value. Also include the statement pm_runtime_disable() under
this label in order to avoid repetition among mid-loop return
conditions. Edit the mid-loop return statements to instead go to this
new label err_node_put.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
