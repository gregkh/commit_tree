can: flexcan: disable completely the ECC mechanism

The ECC (memory error detection and correction) mechanism can be
activated or not, controlled by the ECCDIS bit in CAN_MECR. When
disabled, updates on indications and reporting registers are stopped.
So if want to disable ECC completely, had better assert ECCDIS bit, not
just mask the related interrupts.
