drm/amd/display: Zero-out dsc init regs

[why]
Before a statically allocated PPS data structure, that did
get zeroed-out at startup, had been re-used for making packed PPS
SDP. With S3 fix, using a non-initialized PPS data structure was
introduced, while wrongly assuming it'd get initialized before it's
populated. As a consequence 'vbr_enable' and perhaps some other
fields are left uninitialized when making packed PPS SDP. This can
affect 'simple_422' as well because of the way PPS SDP packing is
done (the fields are not masked first, only shifted). The behavior
will be different, depending on the content of uninitialized data.

[how]
Zero-out PPS data structure at initialization time before it's
populated
