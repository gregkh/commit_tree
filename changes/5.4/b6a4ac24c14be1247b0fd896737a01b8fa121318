net/mlx5e: Reorder mirrer action parsing to check for encap first

Mirred action parsing code in parse_tc_fdb_actions() first checks if
out_dev has same parent id, and only verifies that there is a pending encap
action that was parsed before. Recent change in vxlan module made function
netdev_port_same_parent_id() to return true when called for mlx5 eswitch
representor and vxlan device created explicitly on mlx5 representor
device (vxlan devices created with "external" flag without explicitly
specifying parent interface are not affected). With call to
netdev_port_same_parent_id() returning true, incorrect code path is chosen
and encap rules fail to offload because vxlan dev is not a valid eswitch
forwarding dev. Dmesg log of error:

[ 1784.389797] devices ens1f0_0 vxlan1 not on same switch HW, can't offload forwarding

In order to fix the issue, rearrange conditional in parse_tc_fdb_actions()
to check for pending encap action before checking if out_dev has the same
parent id.
