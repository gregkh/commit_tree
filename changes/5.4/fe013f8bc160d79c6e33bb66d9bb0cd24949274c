Documentation: kbuild: Add document about reproducible builds

In the Distribution Kernels track at Linux Plumbers Conference there
was some discussion around the difficulty of making kernel builds
reproducible.

This is a solved problem, but the solutions don't appear to be
documented in one place.  This document lists the issues I know about
and the settings needed to ensure reproducibility.
