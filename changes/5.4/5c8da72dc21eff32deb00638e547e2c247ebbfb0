libtraceevent: Round up in tep_print_event() time precision

When testing the output of the old trace-cmd compared to the one that
uses the updated tep_print_event() logic, it was different in that the
time stamp precision in the old format would round up to the nearest
precision, where as the new logic truncates. Bring back the old method
of rounding up.
