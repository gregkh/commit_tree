locking/mutex: Make __mutex_owner static to mutex.c

__mutex_owner() should only be used by the mutex api's.
So, to put this restiction let's move the __mutex_owner()
function definition from linux/mutex.h to mutex.c file.

There exist functions that uses __mutex_owner() like
mutex_is_locked() and mutex_trylock_recursive(), So
to keep legacy thing intact move them as well and
export them.

Move mutex_waiter structure also to keep it private to the
file.
