xfs: factor free block index lookup from xfs_dir2_node_addname_int()

Simplify the logic in xfs_dir2_node_addname_int() by factoring out
the free block index lookup code that finds a block with enough free
space for the entry to be added. The code that is moved gets a major
cleanup at the same time, but there is no algorithm change here.
