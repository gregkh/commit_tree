usb: xhci: fix __le32/__le64 accessors in debugfs code

It looks like some of the xhci debug code is passing u32 to functions
directly from __le32/__le64 fields.
Fix this by using le{32,64}_to_cpu() on these to fix the following
sparse warnings;

xhci-debugfs.c:205:62: warning: incorrect type in argument 1 (different base types)
xhci-debugfs.c:205:62:    expected unsigned int [usertype] field0
xhci-debugfs.c:205:62:    got restricted __le32
xhci-debugfs.c:206:62: warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different base types)
xhci-debugfs.c:206:62:    expected unsigned int [usertype] field1
xhci-debugfs.c:206:62:    got restricted __le32
...
