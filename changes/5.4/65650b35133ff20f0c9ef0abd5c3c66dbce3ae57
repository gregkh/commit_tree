cpufreq: Avoid cpufreq_suspend() deadlock on system shutdown

It is incorrect to set the cpufreq syscore shutdown callback pointer
to cpufreq_suspend(), because that function cannot be run in the
syscore stage of system shutdown for two reasons: (a) it may attempt
to carry out actions depending on devices that have already been shut
down at that point and (b) the RCU synchronization carried out by it
may not be able to make progress then.

The latter issue has been present since commit 45975c7d21a1 ("rcu:
Define RCU-sched API in terms of RCU for Tree RCU PREEMPT builds"),
but the former one has been there since commit 90de2a4aa9f3 ("cpufreq:
suspend cpufreq governors on shutdown") regardless.

Fix that by dropping cpufreq_syscore_ops altogether and making
device_shutdown() call cpufreq_suspend() directly before shutting
down devices, which is along the lines of what system-wide power
management does.
