regulator: twl6030: workaround the VMMC reset behavior

During reset the VMMC regulator doesn't reach 0V and only drops to
1.8V, furthermore the pulse width is under 200us whereas the SD
specification expect 1ms.

The WR_S bit allows the TWL6030 to no reset at all the VMMC during warm
reset and keep the current voltage. Thanks to this workaround the SD
card doesn't reach a undefined reset stage.

Actually this behavior is available for all the LDO regulator, so the
driver will also allow to use it with any of these regulator.
