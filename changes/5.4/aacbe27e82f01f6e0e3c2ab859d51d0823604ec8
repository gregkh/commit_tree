net: hns3: modify how pause options is displayed

Currently, the pause options of HNS3 shown like this:
"RX/TX" is always the same with "RX negotiated/TX negotiated".
Because of the driver covered the value of "RX/TX" with the value
of "RX negotiated/TX negotiated" after adjust link.

This patch records the pause configurations of the user, and never
covered them in adjust link.
