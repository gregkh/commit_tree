tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Fix perf-profile command output

commit "c016ae8f9fa04d361efc8629de49ad3af12b5262
"tools/power/x86/intel-speed-select: Output success/failed for command
output" introduced a regression in perf-profile outputs. With this
the result field is changed to string interpreting every non zero
value as errors. But these commands display on zero (>0) result.
For example before this commit the display was:

package-1
  die-0
    cpu-14
        get-config-levels:4

Here the get-config-levels is interpreted as error and displayed
as error with the above commit:

package-1
  die-0
    cpu-14
        get-config-levels:failed(error 4)

Fix this issue by not using isst_display_result() to display such results,
but define a new function which formats this data and prints.
