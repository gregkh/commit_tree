scsi: qla2xxx: Really fix qla2xxx_eh_abort()

I'm not sure how this happened but the patch that was intended to fix abort
handling was incomplete. This patch fixes that patch as follows:

 - If aborting the SCSI command failed, wait until the SCSI command
   completes.

 - Return SUCCESS instead of FAILED if an abort attempt races with SCSI
   command completion.

 - Since qla2xxx_eh_abort() increments the sp reference count by calling
   sp_get(), decrement the sp reference count before returning.
