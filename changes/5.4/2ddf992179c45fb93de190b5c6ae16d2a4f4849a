drm/i915/tgl: Define MOCS entries for Tigerlake

The MOCS table is published as part of bspec, and versioned. Entries
are supposed to never be modified, but new ones can be added. Adding
entries increases table version. The patch includes version 1 entries.

Two of the 3 legacy entries used for gen9 are no longer expected to work.
Although we are changing the gen11 table, those changes are supposed to
be backward compatible since we are only touching previously undefined
entries.

v2: Add the missing entries in 49-51 range and replace "HW reserved"
    terminology to what it actually is: L1 is implicitly enabled
    (from Daniele)
v3: Use a different table for Tiger Lake since entries 0 and 1 are not
    the same (from Daniele)
