scsi: ufs-qcom: Implement device_reset vops

The UFS_RESET pin on Qualcomm SoCs are controlled by TLMM and exposed
through the GPIO framework. Acquire the device-reset GPIO and use this to
implement the device_reset vops, to allow resetting the attached memory.

Based on downstream support implemented by Subhash Jadavani
