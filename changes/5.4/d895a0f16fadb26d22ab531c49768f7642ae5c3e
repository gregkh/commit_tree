bpf: fix accessing bpf_sysctl.file_pos on s390

"ctx:file_pos sysctl:read write ok" fails on s390 with "Read value  !=
nux". This is because verifier rewrites a complete 32-bit
bpf_sysctl.file_pos update to a partial update of the first 32 bits of
64-bit *bpf_sysctl_kern.ppos, which is not correct on big-endian
systems.

Fix by using an offset on big-endian systems.

Ditto for bpf_sysctl.file_pos reads. Currently the test does not detect
a problem there, since it expects to see 0, which it gets with high
probability in error cases, so change it to seek to offset 3 and expect
3 in bpf_sysctl.file_pos.
