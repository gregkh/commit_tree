btrfs: Return number of compressed extents directly in compress_file_range

compress_file_range returns a void, yet uses a function parameter as a
return value. Make that more idiomatic by simply returning the number
of compressed extents directly. Also track such extents in more aptly
named variables. No functional changes.
