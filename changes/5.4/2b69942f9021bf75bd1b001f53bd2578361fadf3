posix-cpu-timers: Create a container struct

Per task/process data of posix CPU timers is all over the place which
makes the code hard to follow and requires ifdeffery.

Create a container to hold all this information in one place, so data is
consolidated and the ifdeffery can be confined to the posix timer header
file and removed from places like fork.

As a first step, move the cpu_timers list head array into the new struct
and clean up the initializers and simplify fork. The remaining #ifdef in
fork will be removed later.
