ARM: 8914/1: NOMMU: Fix exc_ret for XIP

It was reported that 72cd4064fcca "NOMMU: Toggle only bits in
EXC_RETURN we are really care of" breaks NOMMU+XIP combination.
It happens because saved EXC_RETURN gets overwritten when data
section is relocated.

The fix is to propagate EXC_RETURN via register and let relocation
code to commit that value into memory.

Fixes: 72cd4064fcca ("ARM: 8830/1: NOMMU: Toggle only bits in EXC_RETURN we are really care of")
