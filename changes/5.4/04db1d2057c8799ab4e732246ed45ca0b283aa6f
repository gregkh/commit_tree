usb: cdns3: fix missing assignment of ret before error check on ret

Currently the check on a non-zero return code in ret is false because
ret has been initialized to zero.  I believe that ret should be assigned
to the return from the call to readl_poll_timeout_atomic before the
check on ret.  Since ret is being re-assinged the original initialization
of ret to zero can be removed.
