s390/zcrypt: add base code for cca crypto card info support

This patch widens the information held for cca crypto apqns.
Currently the current and old master key verification pattern
is used by the existing code. Now the new master key registers
mkvp, the 8 byte serial number and state info about each master
key register is part of the cca info cache.

In a next step this information will be used to provide some
additional attributes in sysfs for each CCA crypto adapter.
