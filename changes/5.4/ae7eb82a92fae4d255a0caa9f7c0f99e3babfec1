fs/core/vmcore: Move sev_active() reference to x86 arch code

Secure Encrypted Virtualization is an x86-specific feature, so it shouldn't
appear in generic kernel code because it forces non-x86 architectures to
define the sev_active() function, which doesn't make a lot of sense.

To solve this problem, add an x86 elfcorehdr_read() function to override
the generic weak implementation. To do that, it's necessary to make
read_from_oldmem() public so that it can be used outside of vmcore.c.

Also, remove the export for sev_active() since it's only used in files that
won't be built as modules.
