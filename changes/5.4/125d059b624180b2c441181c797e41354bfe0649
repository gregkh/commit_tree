kbuild: do not descend to ./Kbuild when cleaning

'make clean' descends into ./Kbuild, but does not clean anything
since everything is added to no-clean-files.

There is no need to descend to ./Kbuild in the first place.
We can drop the no-clean-files assignment.

With this, there is no more user of no-clean-files. I will keep it
for a while to see whether a new user will appear.
