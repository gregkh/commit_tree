net/mlx5e: Move local var definition into ifdef block

New local variable "struct flow_block_offload *f" was added to
mlx5e_setup_tc() in recent rtnl lock removal patches. The variable is used
in code that is only compiled when CONFIG_MLX5_ESWITCH is enabled. This
results compilation warning about unused variable when CONFIG_MLX5_ESWITCH
is not set. Move the variable definition into eswitch-specific code block
from the beginning of mlx5e_setup_tc() function.
