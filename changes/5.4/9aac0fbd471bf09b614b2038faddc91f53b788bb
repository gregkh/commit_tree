fm10k: explicitly return 0 on success path in function

In the fm10k_handle_resume function, return 0 explicitly at the end of
the function instead of returning the err value.

This was detected by cppcheck and resolves the following style warning
produced by that tool:

[fm10k_pci.c:2768] -> [fm10k_pci.c:2787]: (warning) Identical condition
'err', second condition is always false
