Input: add support for the FlySky FS-iA6B RC receiver

This patch adds support for the FlySky FS-iA6B RC receiver (serial IBUS).

It allows the usage of the FlySky FS-i6 and other AFHDS compliant remote
controls as a joystick input device.

To use it, a patch to inputattach which adds the FS-iA6B as a 115200 baud
serial device is required. I will upstream it after this patch is merged.
