leds: pwm: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct led_pwm_priv {
	...
        struct led_pwm_data leds[0];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following function:

static inline size_t sizeof_pwm_leds_priv(int num_leds)
{
       return sizeof(struct led_pwm_priv) +
                     (sizeof(struct led_pwm_data) * num_leds);
}

with:

struct_size(priv, leds, count)
