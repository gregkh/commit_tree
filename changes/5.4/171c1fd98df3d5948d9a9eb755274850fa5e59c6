hv_netvsc: Fix send_table offset in case of a host bug

If negotiated NVSP version <= NVSP_PROTOCOL_VERSION_6, the offset may
be wrong (too small) due to a host bug. This can cause missing the
end of the send indirection table, and add multiple zero entries from
leading zeros before the data region. This bug adds extra burden on
channel 0.

So fix the offset by computing it from the data structure sizes. This
will ensure netvsc driver runs normally on unfixed hosts, and future
fixed hosts.
