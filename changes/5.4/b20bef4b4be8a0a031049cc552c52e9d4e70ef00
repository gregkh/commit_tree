HID: i2c-hid: modify quirks for weida's devices

This 'SET_PWR_WAKEUP_DEV' quirk only works for weida's devices with pid
0xC300 & 0xC301. Some weida's devices with other pids also need this quirk
now. Use 'HID_ANY_ID' instead of 0xC300 to make all of weida's devices can be
fixed on the power on issue. This modification should be safe since devices
without power on issue will send the power on command only once.
