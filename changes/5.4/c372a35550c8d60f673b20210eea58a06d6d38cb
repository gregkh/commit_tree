ASoC: uniphier: Fix double reset assersion when transitioning to suspend state

When transitioning to supend state, uniphier_aio_dai_suspend() is called
and asserts reset lines and disables clocks.

However, if there are two or more DAIs, uniphier_aio_dai_suspend() are
called multiple times, and double reset assersion will cause.

This patch defines the counter that has the number of DAIs at first, and
whenever uniphier_aio_dai_suspend() are called, it decrements the
counter. And only if the counter is zero, it asserts reset lines and
disables clocks.

In the same way, uniphier_aio_dai_resume() are called, it increments the
counter after deasserting reset lines and enabling clocks.
