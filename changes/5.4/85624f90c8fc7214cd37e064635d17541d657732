platform/x86: asus-wmi: Make it depend on ACPI battery API

When driver has been switched to use ACPI battery API in the commit

  7973353e92ee ("Refactor charge threshold to use the battery hooking API")

it makes it implicitly dependent to a corresponding kernel configuration
option.

Make this dependency explicit in Kconfig.
