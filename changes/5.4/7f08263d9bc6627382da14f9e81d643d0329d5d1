mm/hmm: remove the page_shift member from struct hmm_range

All users pass PAGE_SIZE here, and if we wanted to support single entries
for huge pages we should really just add a HMM_FAULT_HUGEPAGE flag instead
that uses the huge page size instead of having the caller calculate that
size once, just for the hmm code to verify it.
