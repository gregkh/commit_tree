uprobe: use original page when all uprobes are removed

Currently, uprobe swaps the target page with a anonymous page in both
install_breakpoint() and remove_breakpoint().  When all uprobes on a page
are removed, the given mm is still using an anonymous page (not the
original page).

This patch allows uprobe to use original page when possible (all uprobes
on the page are already removed, and the original page is in page cache
and uptodate).

As suggested by Oleg, we unmap the old_page and let the original page
fault in.
