clk: versatile: Add of_node_put() in cm_osc_setup()

In function cm_osc_setup, variable parent takes the value returned by
of_get_parent, which gets a node but does not put it. If parent is not
put before it goes out of scope, it may cause a memory leak.
Hence put parent before the function terminates.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
