selftests/ftrace: Select an existing function in kprobe_eventname test

Running the ftrace selftests on the latest kernel caused the
kprobe_eventname test to fail. It was due to the test that searches for
a function with at "dot" in the name and adding a probe to that.
Unfortunately, for this test, it picked:

 optimize_nops.isra.2.cold.4

Which happens to be marked as "__init", which means it no longer exists
in the kernel! (kallsyms keeps those function names around for tracing
purposes)

As only functions that still exist are in the
available_filter_functions file, as they are removed when the functions
are freed at boot or module exit, have the test search for a function
with ".isra." in the name as well as being in the
available_filter_functions (if the file exists).
