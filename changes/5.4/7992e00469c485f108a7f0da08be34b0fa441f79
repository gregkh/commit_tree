ubifs: Fix memory leak in __ubifs_node_verify_hmac error path

In __ubifs_node_verify_hmac(), 'hmac' is allocated through kmalloc().
However, it is not deallocated in the following execution if
ubifs_node_calc_hmac() fails, leading to a memory leak bug. To fix this
issue, free 'hmac' before returning the error.
