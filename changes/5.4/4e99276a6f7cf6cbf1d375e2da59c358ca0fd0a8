phy: enable compile-testing for the Lantiq PHY drivers

Unconditionally include the lantiq subdirectory in the phy Makefile.

All drivers in there have their dependencies maintained. One of these
(optional) dependencies is COMPILE_TEST, however this can only be
evaluated when Kconfig scans the lantiq subdirectory.
