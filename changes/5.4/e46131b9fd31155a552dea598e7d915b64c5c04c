ubi: block: Warn if volume size is not multiple of 512

If volume size is not a multiple of 512, ubi block cuts
off the last bytes of an volume since the block layer works
on 512 byte sectors.
This can happen especially on NOR flash with minimal io
size of 1.

To avoid unpleasant surprises, print a warning.
