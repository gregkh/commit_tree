firmware: imx: scu-pd: Rename mu PD range to mu_a

The Messaging Unit module enables two processors within the SoC to
communicate and coordinate by passing messages through the MU interface.

MUs have 2 “sides” with independent programming interfaces. Rename
mu PD range to mu_a because it's actually side A of MUs.
