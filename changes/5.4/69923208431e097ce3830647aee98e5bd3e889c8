symbol namespaces: revert to previous __ksymtab name scheme

The introduction of Symbol Namespaces changed the naming schema of the
__ksymtab entries from __kysmtab__symbol to __ksymtab_NAMESPACE.symbol.

That caused some breakages in tools that depend on the name layout in
either the binaries(vmlinux,*.ko) or in System.map. E.g. kmod's depmod
would not be able to read System.map without a patch to support symbol
namespaces. A warning reported by depmod for namespaced symbols would
look like

  depmod: WARNING: [...]/uas.ko needs unknown symbol usb_stor_adjust_quirks

In order to address this issue, revert to the original naming scheme and
rather read the __kstrtabns_<symbol> entries and their corresponding
values from __ksymtab_strings to update the namespace values for
symbols. After having read all symbols and handled them in
handle_modversions(), the symbols are created. In a second pass, read
the __kstrtabns_ entries and update the namespaces accordingly.
