net/smc: fix refcount non-blocking connect() -part 2

If an SMC socket is immediately terminated after a non-blocking connect()
has been called, a memory leak is possible.
Due to the sock_hold move in
commit 301428ea3708 ("net/smc: fix refcounting for non-blocking connect()")
an extra sock_put() is needed in smc_connect_work(), if the internal
TCP socket is aborted and cancels the sk_stream_wait_connect() of the
connect worker.
