Btrfs: fix selftests failure due to uninitialized i_mode in test inodes

Some of the self tests create a test inode, setup some extents and then do
calls to btrfs_get_extent() to test that the corresponding extent maps
exist and are correct. However btrfs_get_extent(), since the 5.2 merge
window, now errors out when it finds a regular or prealloc extent for an
inode that does not correspond to a regular file (its ->i_mode is not
S_IFREG). This causes the self tests to fail sometimes, specially when
KASAN, slub_debug and page poisoning are enabled:

  $ modprobe btrfs
  modprobe: ERROR: could not insert 'btrfs': Invalid argument

This happens because the test inodes are created without ever initializing
the i_mode field of the inode, and neither VFS's new_inode() nor the btrfs
callback btrfs_alloc_inode() initialize the i_mode. Initialization of the
i_mode is done through the various callbacks used by the VFS to create
new inodes (regular files, directories, symlinks, tmpfiles, etc), which
all call btrfs_new_inode() which in turn calls inode_init_owner(), which
sets the inode's i_mode. Since the tests only uses new_inode() to create
the test inodes, the i_mode was never initialized.

This always happens on a VM I used with kasan, slub_debug and many other
debug facilities enabled. It also happened to someone who reported this
on bugzilla (on a 5.3-rc).

Fix this by setting i_mode to S_IFREG at btrfs_new_test_inode().
