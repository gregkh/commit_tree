btrfs: block-group: Fix a memory leak due to missing btrfs_put_block_group()

In btrfs_read_block_groups(), if we have an invalid block group which
has mixed type (DATA|METADATA) while the fs doesn't have MIXED_GROUPS
feature, we error out without freeing the block group cache.

This patch will add the missing btrfs_put_block_group() to prevent
memory leak.

Note for stable backports: the file to patch in versions <= 5.3 is
fs/btrfs/extent-tree.c

Fixes: 49303381f19a ("Btrfs: bail out if block group has different mixed flag")
