net/smc: receive pending data after RCV_SHUTDOWN

smc_rx_recvmsg() first checks if data is available, and then if
RCV_SHUTDOWN is set. There is a race when smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() runs
in between these 2 checks, receives data and sets RCV_SHUTDOWN.
In that case smc_rx_recvmsg() would return from receive without to
process the available data.
Fix that with a final check for data available if RCV_SHUTDOWN is set.
Move the check for data into a function and call it twice.
And use the existing helper smc_rx_data_available().
