drm/i915: Perform GGTT restore much earlier during resume

As soon as we re-enable the various functions within the HW, they may go
off and read data via a GGTT offset. Hence, if we have not yet restored
the GGTT PTE before then, they may read and even *write* random locations
in memory.

Detected by DMAR faults during resume.
