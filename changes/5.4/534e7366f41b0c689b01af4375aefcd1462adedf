net/mlx5e: Fix ethtool self test: link speed

Ethtool self test contains a test for link speed. This test reads the
PTYS register and determines whether the current speed is valid or not.
Change current implementation to use the function mlx5e_port_linkspeed()
that does the same check and fails when speed is invalid. This code
redundancy lead to a bug when mlx5e_port_linkspeed() was updated with
expended speeds and the self test was not.
