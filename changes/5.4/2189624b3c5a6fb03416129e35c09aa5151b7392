ACPI: PM: Drop Dell XPS13 9360 from LPS0 Idle _DSM blacklist

This reverts part of commit 71630b7a832f ("ACPI / PM: Blacklist Low
Power S0 Idle _DSM for Dell XPS13 9360") to remove the S0ix blacklist
for the XPS 9360.

The problems with this system occurred in one possible NVME SSD when
putting system into s0ix.  As the NVME sleep behavior has been adjusted
in commit d916b1be94b6 ("nvme-pci: use host managed power state for
suspend") this is expected to be now resolved.
