crypto: arm64/aes-ccm - switch to AES library

The CCM code calls directly into the scalar table based AES cipher for
arm64 from the fallback path, and since this implementation is known to
be non-time invariant, doing so from a time invariant SIMD cipher is a
bit nasty.

So let's switch to the AES library - this makes the code more robust,
and drops the dependency on the generic AES cipher, allowing us to
omit it entirely in the future.
