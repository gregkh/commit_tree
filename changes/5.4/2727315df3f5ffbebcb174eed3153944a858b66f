gpiolib: acpi: Add Terra Pad 1061 to the run_edge_events_on_boot_blacklist

The Terra Pad 1061 has the usual micro-USB-B id-pin handler, but instead
of controlling the actual micro-USB-B it turns the 5V boost for the
tablet's USB-A connector and its keyboard-cover connector off.

The actual micro-USB-B connector on the tablet is wired for charging only,
and its id pin is *not* connected to the GPIO which is used for the
(broken) id-pin event handler in the DSDT.

While at it not only add a comment why the Terra Pad 1061 is on the
blacklist, but also fix the missing comment for the Minix Neo Z83-4 entry.
