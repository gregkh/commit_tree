SUNRPC: Fix congestion window race with disconnect

If the congestion window closes just as the transport disconnects,
a reconnect is never driven because:

1. The XPRT_CONG_WAIT flag prevents tasks from taking the write lock
2. There's no wake-up of the first task on the xprt->sending queue

To address this, clear the congestion wait flag as part of
completing a disconnect.
