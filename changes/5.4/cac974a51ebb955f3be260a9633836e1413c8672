ASoC: SOF: topology: use set_get_data in process load

Currently when loading sof process components there's a check if binary
control data is associated with it. If found the data is extracted to be
part of component loading and initialization. If binary data exceeds the
ipc max size, loading fails with error as large message support is only
implemented in set_get_data method. So make the process loading use
set_get_data to enable large parameters in component initialization.

Also refactor the process component loading function as it digs out 3
times almost identical information of related controls. This is
redundant, looks ugly and makes it difficult to understand the
mechanism. So make a function out of fetching the control data and use
it in process loading.
