crypto: caam - change return value in case CAAM has no MDHA

To be consistent with other CAAM modules, caamhash should return 0
instead of -ENODEV in case CAAM has no MDHA.

Based on commit 1b46c90c8e00 ("crypto: caam - convert top level drivers to libraries")
the value returned by entry point is never checked and
the exit point is always executed.
