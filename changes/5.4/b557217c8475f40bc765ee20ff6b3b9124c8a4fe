scsi: ufs: fix broken hba->outstanding_tasks

Currently bits in hba->outstanding_tasks are cleared only after their
corresponding task management commands are successfully done by
__ufshcd_issue_tm_cmd().

If timeout happens in a task management command, its corresponding bit in
hba->outstanding_tasks will not be cleared until next task management
command with the same tag used successfully finishes.

This is wrong and can lead to some issues, like power issue.  For example,
ufshcd_release() and ufshcd_gate_work() will do nothing if
hba->outstanding_tasks is not zero even if both UFS host and devices are
actually idle.

Solution is referred from error handling of device commands: bits in
hba->outstanding_tasks shall be cleared regardless of their execution
results.
