nvme: Prevent resets during paused controller state

A paused controller is doing critical internal activation work in the
background. Prevent subsequent controller resets from occurring during
this period by setting the controller state to RESETTING first. A helper
function, nvme_try_sched_reset_work(), is introduced for these paths so
they may continue with scheduling the reset_work after they've completed
their uninterruptible critical section.
