nvme: fix ns removal hang when failing to revalidate due to a transient error

If a controller reset is racing with a namespace revalidation, the
revalidation (admin) I/O will surely fail, but we should not remove the
namespace as we will execute the I/O when the controller is back up.
Same for spurious allocation errors (return -ENOMEM).

Fix this by checking the specific error code in nvme_revalidate_disk and
if it is a transient error (for example non DNR nvme statuses or
a negative ENOMEM as allocation failure), do not remove the namespace as
it will either recover when the controller is back up and schedule
a subsequent scan, or the controller is going away and the namespaces
will be removed anyways.

This fixes a hang namespace scanning racing with a controller reset and
also sporious I/O errors in path failover coditions where the
controller reset is racing with the namespace scan work with multipath
enabled.
