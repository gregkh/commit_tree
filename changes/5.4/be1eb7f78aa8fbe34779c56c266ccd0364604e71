crypto: essiv - create wrapper template for ESSIV generation

Implement a template that wraps a (skcipher,shash) or (aead,shash) tuple
so that we can consolidate the ESSIV handling in fscrypt and dm-crypt and
move it into the crypto API. This will result in better test coverage, and
will allow future changes to make the bare cipher interface internal to the
crypto subsystem, in order to increase robustness of the API against misuse.
