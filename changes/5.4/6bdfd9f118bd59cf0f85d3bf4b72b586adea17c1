perf jevents: Fix period for Intel fixed counters

The Intel fixed counters use a special table to override the JSON
information.

During this override the period information from the JSON file got
dropped, which results in inst_retired.any and similar running with
frequency mode instead of a period.

Just specify the expected period in the table.
