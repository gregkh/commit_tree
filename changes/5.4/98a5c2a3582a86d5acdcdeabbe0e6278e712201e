drm/i915/tgl: skip setting PORT_CL_DW12_* on initialization

According to the spec when initializing the display in TGL we should not
set PORT_CL_DW12 for the Aux channel of the combo PHYs. We will re-use the
power well hooks from ICL so only set this register on gen < 12.

v2: Generalize check for gen 12 (suggested by José)
v3: Rebase after enum phy introduction
