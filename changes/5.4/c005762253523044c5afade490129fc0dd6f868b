drm/amd/display: Enable HW rotation

[Why] HW rotation is not enabled. Calculations for cursor rotation
are wrong for the values passed to set_cursor_position.

[How] Swap Src rect and height and vertically mirror surface for
the correct surface rotation direction. Cursor position is rotated
according to angle. Offset calculations are tweaked for non-rotated
cursor hotspot and width/height.
