drm/i915/selftests: Common live setup/teardown

We frequently, but not frequently enough!, remember to flush residual
operations and objects at the end of a live subtest. The purpose is to
cleanup after every subtest, leaving a clean slate for the next subtest,
and perform early detection of leaky state. As this should ideally be
common for all live subtests, pull the task into a common teardown
routine.
