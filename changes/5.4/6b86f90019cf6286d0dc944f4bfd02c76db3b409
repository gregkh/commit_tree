drm/i915: Replace global bsd_dispatch_index with random seed

We keep a global seed for the legacy BSD round-robin selector, but in
our testing of multiple simultaneous client workloads, a random seed
spreads the load more evenly. (As even as an initial round-robin selector
can be!) Removing the global is one less variable we have to find a home
for!

We can simulate multi-client (both same and mixed workloads) using
igt/gem_wsim to work out optimal strategies and then compare our
simulation with the actual transcoder on multi-engine machines. This
fixed round-robin turns out to be one of the worst methods.

No user is advised to use this method; the current suggestion is to use
a virtual engine for agnostic batches, randomised submission or using
the busyness tracking to select the most idle engine at the time of
dispatch. At the present time, intel-media is explicit, but libva still
seems to use it, with the exception of batches that must execute on vcs0.
Oh well.
