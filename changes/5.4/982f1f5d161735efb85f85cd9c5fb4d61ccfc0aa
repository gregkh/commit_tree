btrfs: Add an assertion to warn incorrect case in insert_inline_extent()

In insert_inline_extent(), the case that checks compressed_size > 0
and compressed_pages = NULL cannot occur, otherwise a null-pointer
dereference may occur on line 215:

     cpage = compressed_pages[i];

To catch this incorrect case, an assertion is added.
