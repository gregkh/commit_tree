xprtrdma: Send Queue size grows after a reconnect

Eli Dorfman reports that after a series of idle disconnects, an
RPC/RDMA transport becomes unusable (rdma_create_qp returns
-ENOMEM). Problem was tracked down to increasing Send Queue size
after each reconnect.

The rdma_create_qp() API does not promise to leave its @qp_init_attr
parameter unaltered. In fact, some drivers do modify one or more of
its fields. Thus our calls to rdma_create_qp must use a fresh copy
of ib_qp_init_attr each time.

This fix is appropriate for kernels dating back to late 2007, though
it will have to be adapted, as the connect code has changed over the
years.
