kbuild: use $(basename ...) for cmd_asn1_compiler

$(basename ...) trims the last suffix. Using it is more intuitive in
my opinion.

This pattern rule makes %.asn1.c and %.asn1.h at the same time.
Previously, the short log showed only either of them, depending on
the target file in question.

To clarify that two files are being generated by the single recipe,
I changed the log as follows:

Before:

  ASN.1   crypto/asymmetric_keys/x509.asn1.c

After:

  ASN.1   crypto/asymmetric_keys/x509.asn1.[ch]
