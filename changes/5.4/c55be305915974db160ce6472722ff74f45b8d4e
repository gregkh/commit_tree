spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Use poll mode in case the platform IRQ is missing

On platforms like LS1021A which use TCFQ mode, an interrupt needs to be
processed after each byte is TXed/RXed. I tried to make the DSPI
implementation on this SoC operate in other, more efficient modes (EOQ,
DMA) but it looks like it simply isn't possible.

Therefore allow the driver to operate in poll mode, to ease a bit of
this absurd amount of IRQ load generated in TCFQ mode. Doing so reduces
both the net time it takes to transmit a SPI message, as well as the
inter-frame jitter that occurs while doing so.
