mm/memremap: drop unused SECTION_SIZE and SECTION_MASK

SECTION_SIZE and SECTION_MASK macros are not getting used anymore.  But
they do conflict with existing definitions on arm64 platform causing
following warning during build.  Lets drop these unused macros.

  mm/memremap.c:16: warning: "SECTION_MASK" redefined
   #define SECTION_MASK ~((1UL << PA_SECTION_SHIFT) - 1)
  arch/arm64/include/asm/pgtable-hwdef.h:79: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   #define SECTION_MASK  (~(SECTION_SIZE-1))

  mm/memremap.c:17: warning: "SECTION_SIZE" redefined
   #define SECTION_SIZE (1UL << PA_SECTION_SHIFT)
  arch/arm64/include/asm/pgtable-hwdef.h:78: note: this is the location of the previous definition
   #define SECTION_SIZE  (_AC(1, UL) << SECTION_SHIFT)
