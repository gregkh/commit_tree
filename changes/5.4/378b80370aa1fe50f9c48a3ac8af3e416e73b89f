hidraw: Return EPOLLOUT from hidraw_poll

Always return EPOLLOUT from hidraw_poll when a device is connected.
This is safe since writes are always possible (but will always block).

hidraw does not support non-blocking writes and instead always calls
blocking backend functions on write requests. Hence, so far, a call to
poll never returned EPOLLOUT, which confuses tools like socat.
