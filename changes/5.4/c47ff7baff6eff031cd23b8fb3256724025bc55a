net/mlx5: DR, Add required FW steering functionality

SW steering is capable of doing many steering functionalities
but there are still some functionalities which are not exposed
to upper layers and therefore performed by the FW.

This is the support for recalculating checksum using a hairpin QP.
The recalculation is required after a modify TTL action which skips
the needed CS calculation in HW.
