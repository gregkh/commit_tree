ALSA: pcm: add support for 352.8KHz and 384KHz sample rate

Most of the modern codecs supports 352.8KHz and 384KHz sample rates.
Currenlty HW params fails to set 352.8Kz and 384KHz sample rate
as these are not in known rates list.
Add these new rates to known list to allow them.

This patch also adds defines in pcm.h so that drivers can use it.
