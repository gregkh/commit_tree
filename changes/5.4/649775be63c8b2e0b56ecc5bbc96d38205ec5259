mm, fs: move randomize_stack_top from fs to mm

Patch series "Provide generic top-down mmap layout functions", v6.

This series introduces generic functions to make top-down mmap layout
easily accessible to architectures, in particular riscv which was the
initial goal of this series.  The generic implementation was taken from
arm64 and used successively by arm, mips and finally riscv.

Note that in addition the series fixes 2 issues:

- stack randomization was taken into account even if not necessary.

- [1] fixed an issue with mmap base which did not take into account
  randomization but did not report it to arm and mips, so by moving arm64
  into a generic library, this problem is now fixed for both
  architectures.

This work is an effort to factorize architecture functions to avoid code
duplication and oversights as in [1].

This patch (of 14):

This preparatory commit moves this function so that further introduction
of generic topdown mmap layout is contained only in mm/util.c.
