erofs: fix erofs_get_meta_page locking due to a cleanup

After doing more drop_caches stress test on
our products, I found the mistake introduced by
a very recent cleanup [1].

The current rule is that "erofs_get_meta_page"
should be returned with page locked (although
it's mostly unnecessary for read-only fs after
pages are PG_uptodate), but a fix should be
done for this.
