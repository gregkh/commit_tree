io_uring: fix use-after-free of shadow_req

There is a potential dangling pointer problem. we never clean
shadow_req, if there are multiple link lists in this series of
sqes, then the shadow_req will not reallocate, and continue to
use the last one. but in the previous, his memory has been
released, thus forming a dangling pointer. let's clean up him
and make sure that every new link list can reapply for a new
shadow_req.
