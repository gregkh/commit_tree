cramfs: fix usage on non-MTD device

When both CONFIG_CRAMFS_MTD and CONFIG_CRAMFS_BLOCKDEV are enabled, if
we fail to mount on MTD, we don't try on block device.

Note: this relies upon cramfs_mtd_fill_super() leaving no side
effects on fc state in case of failure; in general, failing
get_tree_...() does *not* mean "fine to try again"; e.g. parsed
options might've been consumed by fill_super callback and freed
on failure.
