drm/i915/gen11: Allow usage of all GPIO pins

Our pin mapping tables for ICP and MCC currently only list the standard
GPIO pins used for various output ports.  Even through ICP's standard
pin usage only utilizes pins 1, 2, and 9-12, and MCC's standard pin
usage only uses pins 1, 2, and 9, these platforms do still have GPIO
registers to address pins in the range 1-3 and 9-14.  OEM's may remap
GPIO usage in non-standard ways (and provide the actual mapping via VBT
settings), so we shouldn't exclude pins on these platforms just because
they aren't part of the standard mappings.

TGP's standard pin tables contains all the possible pins, so let's
rename them to "icp" and use them for all PCH >= PCH_ICP.  This will
prevent intel_gmbus_is_valid_pin from rejecting non-standard pin usage
that an OEM specifies via the VBT.

Note that this will cause pin 9 to be labeled as "tc1" instead of "dpc"
in debug messages on platforms with the MCC PCH, but that may actually
help avoid confusion since the text strings will now be the same on all
gen11+ platforms instead of being different on just EHL.

v2: Drop now-unused MCC_DDC_BUS_DDI_* names.

v3: We want to compare against INTEL_PCH_TYPE, not INTEL_PCH_ID.
