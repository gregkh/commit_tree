arm64: mm: Logic to make offset_ttbr1 conditional

When running with a 52-bit userspace VA and a 48-bit kernel VA we offset
ttbr1_el1 to allow the kernel pagetables with a 52-bit PTRS_PER_PGD to
be used for both userspace and kernel.

Moving on to a 52-bit kernel VA we no longer require this offset to
ttbr1_el1 should we be running on a system with HW support for 52-bit
VAs.

This patch introduces conditional logic to offset_ttbr1 to query
SYS_ID_AA64MMFR2_EL1 whenever 52-bit VAs are selected. If there is HW
support for 52-bit VAs then the ttbr1 offset is skipped.

We choose to read a system register rather than vabits_actual because
offset_ttbr1 can be called in places where the kernel data is not
actually mapped.

Calls to offset_ttbr1 appear to be made from rarely called code paths so
this extra logic is not expected to adversely affect performance.
