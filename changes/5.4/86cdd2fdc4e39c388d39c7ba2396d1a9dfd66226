kheaders: make headers archive reproducible

In commit 43d8ce9d65a5 ("Provide in-kernel headers to make
extending kernel easier") a new mechanism was introduced, for kernels
>=5.2, which embeds the kernel headers in the kernel image or a module
and exposes them in procfs for use by userland tools.

The archive containing the header files has nondeterminism caused by
header files metadata. This patch normalizes the metadata and utilizes
KBUILD_BUILD_TIMESTAMP if provided and otherwise falls back to the
default behaviour.

In commit f7b101d33046 ("kheaders: Move from proc to sysfs") it was
modified to use sysfs and the script for generation of the archive was
renamed to what is being patched.
