lib: scatterlist: Fix to support no mapped sg

In function sg_split, the second sg_calculate_split will return -EINVAL
when in_mapped_nents is 0.

Indeed there is no need to do second sg_calculate_split and sg_split_mapped
when in_mapped_nents is 0, as in_mapped_nents indicates no mapped entry in
original sgl.
