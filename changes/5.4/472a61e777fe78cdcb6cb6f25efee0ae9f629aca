pinctrl/gpio: Take MUX usage into account

The user space like gpioinfo only see the GPIO usage but not the
MUX usage (e.g. I2C or SPI usage) of a pin. As a user we want
to know which pin is free/safe to use. So take the MUX usage of
strict pinmux controllers into account to get a more realistic
view for ioctl GPIO_GET_LINEINFO_IOCTL.
