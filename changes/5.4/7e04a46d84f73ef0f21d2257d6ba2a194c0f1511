powerpc/configs: Disable /dev/port in skiroot defconfig

While reviewing lockdown patches, I discovered that we still enable
/dev/port (CONFIG_DEVPORT) in skiroot.

/dev/port is used for old x86 style IO accesses. It's set up in
drivers/char/mem.c, and is only created if arch_has_dev_port() returns
true. Per arch/powerpc/include/asm/io.h, on PPC64 with PCI, this is
only true if there's a legacy ISA bridge.

Even if a system has a legacy ISA bridge installed, we have no
business accessing it in skiroot.

Deselect CONFIG_DEVPORT for skiroot.
