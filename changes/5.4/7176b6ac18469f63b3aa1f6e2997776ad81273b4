MIPS: Undefine PMD_ORDER for 32-bit builds

During an update long ago to conform to 4-level page code, PMD_ORDER was
changed from 0 to 1, despite the fact that a PMD table is not used at
all in a 32-bit MIPS build. PMD_ORDER does not seem to be used in these
builds. Now, it matches PUD_ORDER, a nonsense #define to give a build
failure with informative error.

The older commit that had redefined PMD_ORDER was
commit c6e8b587718c ("Update MIPS to use the 4-level pagetable code
thereby getting rid of the compacrapability headers.")
