net/mlx5e: Eswitch, change offloads num_flows type to atomic64

Eswitch implements its own locking by means of state_lock mutex and
multiple fine-grained lock in containing data structures, and is supposed
to not rely on rtnl lock. However, eswitch offloads num_flows type is a
regular long long integer and cannot be modified concurrently. This is an
implicit assumptions that mlx5 tc is serialized (by rtnl lock or any other
means). In order to remove implicit dependency on rtnl lock, change
num_flows type to atomic64 to allow concurrent modifications.
