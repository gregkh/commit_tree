Added QUIRKs for ADATA XPG SX8200 Pro 512GB

Booting with default_ps_max_latency_us >6000 makes the device fail.
Also SUBNQN is NULL and gives a warning on each boot/resume.
 $ nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme0 | grep ^subnqn
   subnqn    : (null)

I use this device with an Acer Nitro 5 (AN515-43-R8BF) Laptop.
To be sure is not a Laptop issue only, I tested the device on
my server board  with the same results.
( with 2x,4x link on the board and 4x link on a PCI-E card ).
