arm64: dts: qcom: qcs404-evb: Mark WCSS clocks protected

'7d0c76bdf227 ("clk: qcom: Add WCSS gcc clock control for QCS404")'
introduces two new clocks to gcc. These are not used before
clk_disable_unused() and as such the clock framework tries to disable
them.

But on the EVB these registers are only accessible through TrustZone, so
these clocks must be marked as "protected" to prevent the clock code
from touching them.

Numerical values are used as the constants are not yet available in a
common tree.
