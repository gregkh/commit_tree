drm/amd/display: Check return code for CRC drm_crtc_vblank_get

[Why]
The call to drm_crtc_vblank_get can fail if vblank is disabled and
we try to increment the reference.

Since drm_crtc_vblank_get internally drops the reference when it fails
it means the subsequent drm_crtc_vblank_put(...) when closing the file
drops a zero reference.

This was found via igt@kms_plane@pixel-format-pipe-A-planes.

[How]
Check the return code and return it on failure.

We wouldn't have been able to enable CRC reading anyway since vblank
wasn't enabled.
