erofs: better erofs symlink stuffs

Fix as Christoph suggested [1] [2], "remove is_inode_fast_symlink
and just opencode it in the few places using it"

and
"Please just set the ops directly instead of obsfucating that in
a single caller, single line inline function.  And please set it
instead of the normal symlink iops in the same place where you
also set those."
