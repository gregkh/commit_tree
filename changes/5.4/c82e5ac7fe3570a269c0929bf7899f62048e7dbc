CIFS: Force revalidate inode when dentry is stale

Currently the client indicates that a dentry is stale when inode
numbers or type types between a local inode and a remote file
don't match. If this is the case attributes is not being copied
from remote to local, so, it is already known that the local copy
has stale metadata. That's why the inode needs to be marked for
revalidation in order to tell the VFS to lookup the dentry again
before openning a file. This prevents unexpected stale errors
to be returned to the user space when openning a file.
