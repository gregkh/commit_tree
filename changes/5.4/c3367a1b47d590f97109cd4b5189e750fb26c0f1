udf: augment UDF permissions on new inodes

Windows presents files created within Linux as read-only, even when
permissions in Linux indicate the file should be writable.

UDF defines a slightly different set of basic file permissions than Linux.
Specifically, UDF has "delete" and "change attribute" permissions for each
access class (user/group/other). Linux has no equivalents for these.

When the Linux UDF driver creates a file (or directory), no UDF delete or
change attribute permissions are granted. The lack of delete permission
appears to cause Windows to mark an item read-only when its permissions
otherwise indicate that it should be read-write.

Fix this by having UDF delete permissions track Linux write permissions.
Also grant UDF change attribute permission to the owner when creating a
new inode.
