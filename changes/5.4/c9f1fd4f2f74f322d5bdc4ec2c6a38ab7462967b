Revert "crypto: aegis128 - add support for SIMD acceleration"

This reverts commit ecc8bc81f2fb3976737ef312f824ba6053aa3590
("crypto: aegis128 - provide a SIMD implementation based on NEON
intrinsics") and commit 7cdc0ddbf74a19cecb2f0e9efa2cae9d3c665189
("crypto: aegis128 - add support for SIMD acceleration").

They cause compile errors on platforms other than ARM because
the mechanism to selectively compile the SIMD code is broken.
