net/mlx5e: Always take reference to neigh entry

Neigh entry has reference counter, however it is only used when scheduling
neigh update event. In all other cases reference to neigh entry is not
taken while working with it. Neigh code relies on synchronization provided
by rtnl lock and uses encap list size as implicit reference counter.

To remove dependency on rtnl lock, always take reference to neigh entry
while using it. Remove neigh entry from hash table and delete it only when
reference counter reaches zero. This can result spurious neigh update
events, when there is an event on entry that has zero encaps attached.
However, such events are rare and properly handled by neigh update handler.

Extend encap entry with reference to neigh hash entry in order to be able
to directly release it when encap is detached, instead of lookup nhe by key
through hash table. Extend nhe with reference to device priv structure to
guarantee correctness when nhe is used with stack devices, bond setup, in
which case it is non-trivial to determine correct device when releasing the
nhe.
