Drivers: hv: vmbus: Suspend/resume the vmbus itself for hibernation

Before Linux enters hibernation, it sends the CHANNELMSG_UNLOAD message to
the host so all the offers are gone. After hibernation, Linux needs to
re-negotiate with the host using the same vmbus protocol version (which
was in use before hibernation), and ask the host to re-offer the vmbus
devices.
