seg6: fix skb transport_header after decap_and_validate()

in the receive path (more precisely in ip6_rcv_core()) the
skb->transport_header is set to skb->network_header + sizeof(*hdr). As a
consequence, after routing operations, destination input expects to find
skb->transport_header correctly set to the next protocol (or extension
header) that follows the network protocol. However, decap behaviors (DX*,
DT*) remove the outer IPv6 and SRH extension and do not set again the
skb->transport_header pointer correctly. For this reason, the patch sets
the skb->transport_header to the skb->network_header + sizeof(hdr) in each
DX* and DT* behavior.
