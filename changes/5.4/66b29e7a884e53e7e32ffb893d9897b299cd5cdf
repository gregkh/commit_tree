ice: Update number of VF queue before setting VSI resources

In case there is a request from a VF to change its number of queues, and
the request was successful, we need to update number of queues
configured on the VF before updating corresponding VSI for that VF,
especially LAN Tx queue tree and TC update, otherwise, we would continued
to use old value of vf->num_vf_qs for allocated Tx/Rx queues...
