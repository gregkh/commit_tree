drm/i915/uc: Unify uC platform check

We have several HAS_* checks for GuC and HuC but we mostly use HAS_GUC
and HAS_HUC, with only 1 exception. Since our HW always has either
both uC or neither of them, just replace all the checks with a unified
HAS_UC.

v2: use HAS_GT_UC (Michal)
v3: fix comment (Michal)
