dma-mapping: always use VM_DMA_COHERENT for generic DMA remap

Currently the generic dma remap allocator gets a vm_flags passed by
the caller that is a little confusing.  We just introduced a generic
vmalloc-level flag to identify the dma coherent allocations, so use
that everywhere and remove the now pointless argument.
