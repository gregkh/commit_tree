s390/qdio: let drivers opt-out from Output Queue scanning

If a driver wants to use the new Output Queue poll code, then the qdio
layer must disable its internal Queue scanning. Let the driver select
this mode by passing a special scan_threshold of 0.

As the scan_threshold is the same for all Output Queues, also move it
into the main qdio_irq struct. This allows for fast opt-out checking, a
driver is expected to operate either _all_ or none of its Output Queues
in polling mode.
