hwmon: (pmbus/max31785) Remove a useless #define

There is a typo in MAX37185_NUM_FAN_PAGES. To be consistent, it should be
MAX31785_NUM_FAN_PAGES (1 and 7 switched).

At line 24, we already have:
   #define MAX31785_NR_FAN_PAGES		6
and MAX37185_NUM_FAN_PAGES seems to be unused.

It is likely that it is only a typo and/or a left-over.
So, axe it.
