ASoC: SOF: reset DMA state in prepare

When application goes through SUSPEND/STOP->PREPARE->START
cycle, we should always reprogram the SOF device to start
DMA from a known state so that hw_ptr/appl_ptrs remain valid.
This is expected by ALSA core as it resets the buffer
state as part of prepare (see snd_pcm_do_prepare()).

Fix the issue by forcing reconfiguration of the FW with
STREAM_PCM_PARAMS in prepare(). Use combined logic to handle
prepare and the existing flow to reprogram hw-params after
system suspend.

Without the fix, first call to pcm pointer() will return
an invalid hw_ptr and application may immediately observe XRUN
status, unless "start_threshold" SW parameter is set to maximum
value by the application.
