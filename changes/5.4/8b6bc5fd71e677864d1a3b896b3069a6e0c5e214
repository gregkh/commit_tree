dmaengine: sprd: Fix the link-list pointer register configuration issue

We will set the link-list pointer register point to next link-list
configuration's physical address, which can load DMA configuration
from the link-list node automatically.

But the link-list node's physical address can be larger than 32bits,
and now Spreadtrum DMA driver only supports 32bits physical address,
which may cause loading a incorrect DMA configuration when starting
the link-list transfer mode. According to the DMA datasheet, we can
use SRC_BLK_STEP register (bit28 - bit31) to save the high bits of the
link-list node's physical address to fix this issue.
