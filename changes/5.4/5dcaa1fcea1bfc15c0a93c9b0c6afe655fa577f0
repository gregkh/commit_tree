staging: speakup: document sysfs attributes

Speakup exposes a set of sysfs attributes under
/sys/accessibility/speakup/ for user-space to interact with and
configure speakup's kernel modules. This patch describes those
attributes. Some attributes either lack a description or contain
incomplete description. They are marked wit TODO.
