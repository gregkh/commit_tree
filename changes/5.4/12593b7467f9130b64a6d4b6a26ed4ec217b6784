locking/lockdep: Reduce space occupied by stack traces

Although commit 669de8bda87b ("kernel/workqueue: Use dynamic lockdep keys
for workqueues") unregisters dynamic lockdep keys when a workqueue is
destroyed, a side effect of that commit is that all stack traces
associated with the lockdep key are leaked when a workqueue is destroyed.
Fix this by storing each unique stack trace once. Other changes in this
patch are:

- Use NULL instead of { .nr_entries = 0 } to represent 'no trace'.
- Store a pointer to a stack trace in struct lock_class and struct
  lock_list instead of storing 'nr_entries' and 'offset'.

This patch avoids that the following program triggers the "BUG:
MAX_STACK_TRACE_ENTRIES too low!" complaint:

	#include <fcntl.h>
	#include <unistd.h>

	int main()
	{
		for (;;) {
			int fd = open("/dev/infiniband/rdma_cm", O_RDWR);
			close(fd);
		}
	}
