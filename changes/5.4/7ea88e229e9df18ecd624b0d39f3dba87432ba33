null_blk: create a helper for mem-backed ops

This patch creates a helper for handling requests when null_blk is
memory backed in the null_handle_cmd(). Although the helper is very
simple right now, it makes the code flow consistent with the rest of
code in the null_handle_cmd() and provides a uniform code structure
for future code.
