iio: adc: meson_saradc: Fix memory allocation order

meson_saradc's irq handler uses priv->regmap so make sure that it is
allocated before the irq get enabled.

This also fixes crash when CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ is enabled, as device
managed resources are freed in the inverted order they had been
allocated, priv->regmap was freed before the spurious fake irq that
CONFIG_DEBUG_SHIRQ adds called the handler.
