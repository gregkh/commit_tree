net: socionext: netsec: always grab descriptor lock

Always acquire tx descriptor spinlock even if a xdp program is not loaded
on the netsec device since ndo_xdp_xmit can run concurrently with
netsec_netdev_start_xmit and netsec_clean_tx_dring. This can happen
loading a xdp program on a different device (e.g virtio-net) and
xdp_do_redirect_map/xdp_do_redirect_slow can redirect to netsec even if
we do not have a xdp program on it.
