ASoC: soc-component: move snd_soc_component_set_bias_level()

Current soc-dapm / soc-core are using a long way round to call
.set_bias_level.

	if (driver->set_bias_level)
		dapm->set_bias_level = ...;
	...
	if (dapm->set_bias_level)
		ret = dapm->set_bias_level(...);

We can directly call it via driver->set_bias_level.
One note here is that both Card and Component have dapm,
but, Card's dapm doesn't have dapm->component.
We need to check it.

This patch moves snd_soc_component_set_bias_level() to soc-component.c
and updates parameters.
dapm->set_bias_level is no longer needed
