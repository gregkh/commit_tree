tools lib traceevent: Remove unneeded qsort and uses memmove instead

While reading a trace data file that had 100,000s of tasks, the process
took an extremely long time. I profiled it down to add_new_comm(), which
was doing a qsort() call on an array that was pretty much already sorted
(all but the last element. qsort() isn't very efficient when dealing
with mostly sorted arrays, and this definitely showed its issues.

When adding a new task to the task list, instead of using qsort(), do
another bsearch() with a function that will find the element before
where the new task will be inserted in. Then simply shift the rest of
the array, and insert the task where it belongs.
