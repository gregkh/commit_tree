serial: uartlite: fix exit path null pointer

Call uart_unregister_driver() conditionally instead of
unconditionally, only if it has been previously registered.

This uses driver.state, just as the sh-sci.c driver does.

Fixes this null pointer dereference in tty_unregister_driver(),
since the 'driver' argument is null:

  general protection fault: 0000 [#1] PREEMPT SMP KASAN PTI
  RIP: 0010:tty_unregister_driver+0x25/0x1d0
