gpu: drm: radeon: Fix a possible null-pointer dereference in radeon_connector_set_property()

In radeon_connector_set_property(), there is an if statement on line 743
to check whether connector->encoder is NULL:
    if (connector->encoder)

When connector->encoder is NULL, it is used on line 755:
    if (connector->encoder->crtc)

Thus, a possible null-pointer dereference may occur.

To fix this bug, connector->encoder is checked before being used.

This bug is found by a static analysis tool STCheck written by us.
