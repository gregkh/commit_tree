staging: erofs: some compressed cluster should be submitted for corrupted images

As reported by erofs_utils fuzzer, a logical page can belong
to at most 2 compressed clusters, if one compressed cluster
is corrupted, but the other has been ready in submitting chain.

The chain needs to submit anyway in order to keep the page
working properly (page unlocked with PG_error set, PG_uptodate
not set).

Let's fix it now.
