ASoC: SOF: core: increase default IPC timeouts

Increase the default timeout values for boot (100ms to 2sec) and
IPC message sending (5ms to 500ms). The values should be overridden
with values from platform data.

There is no functional need to have such short timeouts as both boot
and IPC send errors are considered fatal errors. More relaxed timeouts
are convenient when running the driver on top of emulation such as QEMU.
