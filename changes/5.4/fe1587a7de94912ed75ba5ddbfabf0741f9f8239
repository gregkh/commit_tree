net/mlx5e: Fix matching on tunnel addresses type

In mlx5 parse_tunnel_attr() function dispatch on encap IP address type
is performed by directly checking flow_rule_match_key() on
FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_ENC_IPV4_ADDRS, and then on
FLOW_DISSECTOR_KEY_ENC_IPV6_ADDRS. However, since those are stored in
union, first check is always true if any type of encap address is set,
which leads to IPv6 tunnel encap address being parsed as IPv4 by mlx5.
Determine correct IP address type by checking control key first and if
it set, take address type from match.key->addr_type.

Fixes: d1bda7eecd88 ("net/mlx5e: Allow matching only enc_key_id/enc_dst_port for decapsulation action")
