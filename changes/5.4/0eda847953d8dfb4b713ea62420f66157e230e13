net: ena: fix retrieval of nonadaptive interrupt moderation intervals

Nonadaptive interrupt moderation intervals are assigned the value set
by the user in ethtool -C divided by ena_dev->intr_delay_resolution.

Therefore when the user tries to get the nonadaptive interrupt moderation
intervals with ethtool -c the code needs to multiply the saved value
by ena_dev->intr_delay_resolution.

The current code erroneously divides instead of multiplying in ethtool -c.
This patch fixes this.
