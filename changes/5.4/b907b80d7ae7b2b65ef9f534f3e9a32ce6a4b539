arm64: remove pointless __KERNEL__ guards

For a number of years, UAPI headers have been split from kernel-internal
headers. The latter are never exposed to userspace, and always built
with __KERNEL__ defined.

Most headers under arch/arm64 don't have __KERNEL__ guards, but there
are a few stragglers lying around. To make things more consistent, and
to set a good example going forward, let's remove these redundant
__KERNEL__ guards.

In a couple of cases, a trailing #endif lacked a comment describing its
corresponding #if or #ifdef, so these are fixes up at the same time.

Guards in auto-generated crypto code are left as-is, as these guards are
generated by scripting imported from the upstream openssl project
scripts. Guards in UAPI headers are left as-is, as these can be included
by userspace or the kernel.

There should be no functional change as a result of this patch.
