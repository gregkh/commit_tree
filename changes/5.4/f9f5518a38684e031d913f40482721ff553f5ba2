ARM: dts: logicpd-torpedo-baseboard: Fix missing video

A previous commit removed the panel-dpi driver, which made the
Torpedo video stop working because it relied on the dpi driver
for setting video timings.  Now that the simple-panel driver is
available in omap2plus, this patch migrates the Torpedo dev kits
to use a similar panel and remove the manual timing requirements.

Fixes: 8bf4b1621178 ("drm/omap: Remove panel-dpi driver")
