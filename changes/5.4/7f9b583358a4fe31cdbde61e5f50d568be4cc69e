staging: mt7621-pci: avoid use 'err' local variable

Function 'mt7621_pcie_request_resources' is using 'err'
local variable to get value returned from 'devm_request_pci_bus_resources'
and returning after that. This is not needed at all. Instead of that
just directly return returned value by the function which is also
returning zero on success.
