tcp: annotate tp->copied_seq lockless reads

There are few places where we fetch tp->copied_seq while
this field can change from IRQ or other cpu.

We need to add READ_ONCE() annotations, and also make
sure write sides use corresponding WRITE_ONCE() to avoid
store-tearing.

Note that tcp_inq_hint() was already using READ_ONCE(tp->copied_seq)
