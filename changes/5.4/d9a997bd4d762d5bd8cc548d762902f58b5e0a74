iio: accel: adxl372: Perform a reset at start up

We need to perform a reset a start up to make sure that the chip is in a
consistent state. This reset also disables all the interrupts which
should only be enabled together with the iio buffer. Not doing this, was
sometimes causing unwanted interrupts to trigger.
