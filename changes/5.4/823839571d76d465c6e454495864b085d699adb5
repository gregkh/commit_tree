firmware: arm_scmi: Make use SCMI v2.0 fastchannel for performance protocol

SCMI v2.0 adds support for "FastChannel" which do not use a message
header as they are specialized for a single message.

Only PERFORMANCE_LIMITS_{SET,GET} and PERFORMANCE_LEVEL_{SET,GET}
commands are supported over fastchannels. As they are optional, they
need to be discovered by PERFORMANCE_DESCRIBE_FASTCHANNEL command.
Further {LIMIT,LEVEL}_SET commands can have optional doorbell support.

Add support for making use of these fastchannels.
