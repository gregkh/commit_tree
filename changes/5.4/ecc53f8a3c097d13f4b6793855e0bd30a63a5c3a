RDMA/mlx4: Untag user pointers in mlx4_get_umem_mr

This patch is a part of a series that extends kernel ABI to allow to pass
tagged user pointers (with the top byte set to something else other than
0x00) as syscall arguments.

mlx4_get_umem_mr() uses provided user pointers for vma lookups, which can
only by done with untagged pointers.

Untag user pointers in this function.
