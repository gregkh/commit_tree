powerpc/ptdump: fix walk_pagetables() address mismatch

walk_pagetables() always walk the entire pgdir from address 0
but considers PAGE_OFFSET or KERN_VIRT_START as the starting
address of the walk, resulting in a possible mismatch in the
displayed addresses.

Ex: on PPC32, when KERN_VIRT_START was locally defined as
PAGE_OFFSET, ptdump displayed 0x80000000
instead of 0xc0000000 for the first kernel page,
because 0xc0000000 + 0xc0000000 = 0x80000000

Start the walk at st->start_address instead of starting at 0.
