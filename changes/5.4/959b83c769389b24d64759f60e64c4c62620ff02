libperf: Add perf_cpu_map struct

Add perf_cpu_map struct to libperf.

It's added as a declaration into:

  include/perf/cpumap.h

which will be included by users.

The perf_cpu_map struct definition is added into:

  include/internal/cpumap.h

which is not to be included by users, but shared within perf and
libperf.

We tried the total separation of the perf_cpu_map struct in libperf, but
it lead to complications and much bigger changes in perf code, so we
decided to share the declaration.
