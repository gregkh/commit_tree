scsi: hisi_sas: Assign NCQ tag for all NCQ commands

Currently the NCQ tag is only assigned for FPDMA READ and FPDMA WRITE
commands, and for other NCQ commands (such as FPDMA SEND), their NCQ tags
are set in the delivery command to 0.

So for all the NCQ commands, we also need to assign normal NCQ tag for
them, so drop the command type check in hisi_sas_get_ncq_tag() [drop
hisi_sas_get_ncq_tag() altogether actually], and always use the ATA command
NCQ tag when appropriate.
