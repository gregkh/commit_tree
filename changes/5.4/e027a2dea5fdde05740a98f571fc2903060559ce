hwmon (coretemp) Fix a memory leak bug

In coretemp_init(), 'zone_devices' is allocated through kcalloc().
However, it is not deallocated in the following execution if
platform_driver_register() fails, leading to a memory leak. To fix this
issue, introduce the 'outzone' label to free 'zone_devices' before
returning the error.
