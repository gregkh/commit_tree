drivers/base/memory.c: don't store end_section_nr in memory blocks

Each memory block spans the same amount of sections/pages/bytes.  The size
is determined before the first memory block is created.  No need to store
what we can easily calculate - and the calculations even look simpler now.

Michal brought up the idea of variable-sized memory blocks.  However, if
we ever implement something like this, we will need an API compatibility
switch and reworks at various places (most code assumes a fixed memory
block size).  So let's cleanup what we have right now.

While at it, fix the variable naming in register_mem_sect_under_node() -
we no longer talk about a single section.
