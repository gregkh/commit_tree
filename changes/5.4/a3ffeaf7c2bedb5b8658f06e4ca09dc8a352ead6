fm10k: convert NON_Q_VECTORS(hw) into NON_Q_VECTORS

The driver currently uses a macro to decide whether we should use
NON_Q_VECTORS_PF or NON_Q_VECTORS_VF.

However, we also define NON_Q_VECTORS_VF to the same value as
NON_Q_VECTORS_PF. This means that the macro NON_Q_VECTORS(hw) will
always return the same value.

Let's just remove this macro, and replace it directly with an enum value
on the enum non_q_vectors.

This was detected by cppcheck and fixes the following warnings when
building with BUILD=KERNEL
