net: stmmac: Avoid deadlock on suspend/resume

The stmmac driver will try to acquire its private mutex during suspend
via phylink_resolve() -> stmmac_mac_link_down() -> stmmac_eee_init().
However, the phylink configuration is updated with the private mutex
held already, which causes a deadlock during suspend.

Fix this by moving the phylink configuration updates out of the region
of code protected by the private mutex.
