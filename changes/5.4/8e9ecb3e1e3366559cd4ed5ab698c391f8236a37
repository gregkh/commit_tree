drm/i915/display: Handle lost primary_port across suspend

icl-dsi is dying on suspend/resume at

	RIP: 0010:icl_update_active_dpll+0x2c/0xa0 [i915]

which appears due to the loss of the time primary_port across suspend.
Protect against the potential NULL dereference by assuming
ICL_PORT_DPLL_DEFAULT unless the port is actively specified otherwise.

Fixes: 24a7bfe0c2d7 ("drm/i915: Keep the TypeC port mode fixed when the port is active")
