driver core: Add support for linking devices during device addition

When devices are added, the bus might want to create device links to track
functional dependencies between supplier and consumer devices. This
tracking of supplier-consumer relationship allows optimizing device probe
order and tracking whether all consumers of a supplier are active. The
add_links bus callback is added to support this.

However, when consumer devices are added, they might not have a supplier
device to link to despite needing mandatory resources/functionality from
one or more suppliers. A waiting_for_suppliers list is created to track
such consumers and retry linking them when new devices get added.
