Revert "of/platform: Don't create device links for default busses"

This reverts commit b3173c2292fbaf24ff7062d366830b012ed04269.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
