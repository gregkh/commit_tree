fdt: add support for rng-seed

Introducing a chosen node, rng-seed, which is an entropy that can be
passed to kernel called very early to increase initial device
randomness. Bootloader should provide this entropy and the value is
read from /chosen/rng-seed in DT.

Obtain of_fdt_crc32 for CRC check after early_init_dt_scan_nodes(),
since early_init_dt_scan_chosen() would modify fdt to erase rng-seed.

Add a new interface add_bootloader_randomness() for rng-seed use case.
Depends on whether the seed is trustworthy, rng seed would be passed to
add_hwgenerator_randomness(). Otherwise it would be passed to
add_device_randomness(). Decision is controlled by kernel config
RANDOM_TRUST_BOOTLOADER.
