tools: bpftool: add net attach command to attach XDP on interface

interface. New type of enum 'net_attach_type' has been made, as stat ted at
cover-letter, the meaning of 'attach' is, prog will be attached on interface.

With 'overwrite' option at argument, attached XDP program could be replaced.
Added new helper 'net_parse_dev' to parse the network device at argument.

BPF prog will be attached through libbpf 'bpf_set_link_xdp_fd'.
