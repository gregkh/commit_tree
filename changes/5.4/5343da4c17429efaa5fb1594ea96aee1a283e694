net: core: limit nested device depth

Current code doesn't limit the number of nested devices.
Nested devices would be handled recursively and this needs huge stack
memory. So, unlimited nested devices could make stack overflow.

This patch adds upper_level and lower_level, they are common variables
and represent maximum lower/upper depth.
When upper/lower device is attached or dettached,
{lower/upper}_level are updated. and if maximum depth is bigger than 8,
attach routine fails and returns -EMLINK.

In addition, this patch converts recursive routine of
netdev_walk_all_{lower/upper} to iterator routine.

Test commands:
    ip link add dummy0 type dummy
    ip link add link dummy0 name vlan1 type vlan id 1
    ip link set vlan1 up

    for i in {2..55}
    do
	    let A=$i-1

	    ip link add vlan$i link vlan$A type vlan id $i
    done
    ip link del dummy0
