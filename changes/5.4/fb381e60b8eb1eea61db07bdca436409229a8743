fm10k: reduce the scope of the tx_buffer variable

The tx_buffer local variable in the function fm10k_clean_tx_ring is not
used except inside a smaller block scope. Reduce the scope to its point
of use.

This was detected by cppcheck and resolves the following style warning
produced by that tool:

[fm10k_netdev.c:179]: (style) The scope of the variable 'tx_buffer' can
be reduced.
