dt-bindings: regulator: add regulator-fixed-clock binding

This adds the documentation to the compatible regulator-fixed-clock.
This binding is a special binding of regulator-fixed and adds the
ability to add a clock to regulator-fixed, so the regulator can be
enabled and disabled with that clock. If the special compatible
regulator-fixed-clock is used it is mandatory to supply a clock.
