USB: ldusb: use unsigned size format specifiers

A recent info-leak bug manifested itself along with warning about a
negative buffer overflow:

	ldusb 1-1:0.28: Read buffer overflow, -131383859965943 bytes dropped

when it was really a rather large positive one.

A sanity check that prevents this has now been put in place, but let's
fix up the size format specifiers, which should all be unsigned.
