efi: Export Runtime Configuration Interface table to sysfs

System firmware advertises the address of the 'Runtime
Configuration Interface table version 2 (RCI2)' via
an EFI Configuration Table entry. This code retrieves the RCI2
table from the address and exports it to sysfs as a binary
attribute 'rci2' under /sys/firmware/efi/tables directory.
The approach adopted is similar to the attribute 'DMI' under
/sys/firmware/dmi/tables.

RCI2 table contains BIOS HII in XML format and is used to populate
BIOS setup page in Dell EMC OpenManage Server Administrator tool.
The BIOS setup page contains BIOS tokens which can be configured.
