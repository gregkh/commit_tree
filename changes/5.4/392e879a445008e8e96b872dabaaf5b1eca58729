dma-mapping: fix filename references

After commit cf65a0f6f6ff ("dma-mapping: move all DMA mapping code to
kernel/dma") some of the files are referring to outdated information,
i.e. old file names of DMA mapping sources. Fix it here.

Note, the lines with "Glue code for..." have been removed completely.
