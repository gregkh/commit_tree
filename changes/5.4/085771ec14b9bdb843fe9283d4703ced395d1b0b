fs-verity: add UAPI header

Add the UAPI header for fs-verity, including two ioctls:

- FS_IOC_ENABLE_VERITY
- FS_IOC_MEASURE_VERITY

These ioctls are documented in the "User API" section of
Documentation/filesystems/fsverity.rst.

Examples of using these ioctls can be found in fsverity-utils
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/fsverity-utils.git).

I've also written xfstests that test these ioctls
(https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/ebiggers/xfstests-dev.git/log/?h=fsverity).
