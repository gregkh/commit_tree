drop_monitor: Allow truncation of dropped packets

When sending dropped packets to user space it is not always necessary to
copy the entire packet as usually only the headers are of interest.

Allow user to specify the truncation length and add the original length
of the packet as additional metadata to the netlink message.

By default no truncation is performed.
