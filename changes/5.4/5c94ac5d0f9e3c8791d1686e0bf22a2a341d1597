KVM: SVM: Fix potential wrong physical id in avic_handle_ldr_update

Guest physical APIC ID may not equal to vcpu->vcpu_id in some case.
We may set the wrong physical id in avic_handle_ldr_update as we
always use vcpu->vcpu_id. Get physical APIC ID from vAPIC page
instead.
Export and use kvm_xapic_id here and in avic_handle_apic_id_update
as suggested by Vitaly.
