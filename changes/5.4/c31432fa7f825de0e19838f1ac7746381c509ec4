cpufreq: intel_pstate: Fix invalid EPB setting

The max value of EPB can only be 0x0F. Attempting to set more than that
triggers an "unchecked MSR access error" warning which happens in
intel_pstate_hwp_force_min_perf() called via cpufreq stop_cpu().

However, it is not even necessary to touch the EPB from intel_pstate,
because it is restored on every CPU online by the intel_epb.c code,
so let that code do the right thing and drop the redundant (and
incorrect) EPB update from intel_pstate.
