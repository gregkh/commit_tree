net: ipv4: avoid mixed n_redirects and rate_tokens usage

Since commit c09551c6ff7f ("net: ipv4: use a dedicated counter
for icmp_v4 redirect packets") we use 'n_redirects' to account
for redirect packets, but we still use 'rate_tokens' to compute
the redirect packets exponential backoff.

If the device sent to the relevant peer any ICMP error packet
after sending a redirect, it will also update 'rate_token' according
to the leaking bucket schema; typically 'rate_token' will raise
above BITS_PER_LONG and the redirect packets backoff algorithm
will produce undefined behavior.

Fix the issue using 'n_redirects' to compute the exponential backoff
in ip_rt_send_redirect().

Note that we still clear rate_tokens after a redirect silence period,
to avoid changing an established behaviour.

The root cause predates git history; before the mentioned commit in
the critical scenario, the kernel stopped sending redirects, after
the mentioned commit the behavior more randomic.
