blk-mq: move lockdep_assert_held() into elevator_exit

Commit c48dac137a62 ("block: don't hold q->sysfs_lock in elevator_init_mq")
removes q->sysfs_lock from elevator_init_mq(), but forgot to deal with
lockdep_assert_held() called in blk_mq_sched_free_requests() which is
run in failure path of elevator_init_mq().

blk_mq_sched_free_requests() is called in the following 3 functions:

	elevator_init_mq()
	elevator_exit()
	blk_cleanup_queue()

In blk_cleanup_queue(), blk_mq_sched_free_requests() is followed exactly
by 'mutex_lock(&q->sysfs_lock)'.

So moving the lockdep_assert_held() from blk_mq_sched_free_requests()
into elevator_exit() for fixing the report by syzbot.
