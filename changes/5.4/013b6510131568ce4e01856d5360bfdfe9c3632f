drm/panfrost: Add madvise and shrinker support

Add support for madvise and a shrinker similar to other drivers. This
allows userspace to mark BOs which can be freed when there is memory
pressure.

Unlike other implementations, we don't depend on struct_mutex. The
driver maintains a list of BOs which can be freed when the shrinker
is called. Access to the list is serialized with the shrinker_lock.
