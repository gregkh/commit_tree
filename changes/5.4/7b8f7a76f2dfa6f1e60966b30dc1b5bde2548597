clk: renesas: r9a06g032: Set GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON for clock domain

The RZ/N1 Clock Domain driver does not implement the
generic_pm_domain.power_{on,off}() callbacks, as the domain itself
cannot be powered down.  Hence the domain should be marked as always-on
by setting the GENPD_FLAG_ALWAYS_ON flag, to prevent the core PM Domain
code from considering it for power-off, and doing unnessary processing.
