scsi: target: core: Do not overwrite CDB byte 1

passthrough_parse_cdb() - used by TCMU and PSCSI - attepts to reset the LUN
field of SCSI-2 CDBs (bits 5,6,7 of byte 1).  The current code is wrong as
for newer commands not having the LUN field it overwrites relevant command
bits (e.g. for SECURITY PROTOCOL IN / OUT). We think this code was
unnecessary from the beginning or at least it is no longer useful. So we
remove it entirely.
