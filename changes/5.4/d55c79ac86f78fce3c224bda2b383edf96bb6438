EDAC: Prefer 'unsigned int' to bare use of 'unsigned'

Use of 'unsigned int' instead of bare use of 'unsigned'. Fix this for
edac_mc*, ghes and the i5100 driver as reported by checkpatch.pl.

While at it, struct member dev_ch_attribute->channel is always used as
unsigned int. Change type to unsigned int to avoid type casts.
