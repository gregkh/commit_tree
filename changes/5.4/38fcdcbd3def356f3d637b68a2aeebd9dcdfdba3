rtlwifi: rtl8188ee: Fix incorrect returned values

In commit 36eda7568f2e ("rtlwifi: rtl8188ee: Convert macros that set
descriptor"), all the routines that get fields from a descriptor were
changed to return signed integer values. This is incorrect for the
routines that get the entire 32-bit word. In this case, an unsigned
quantity is required.
