btrfs: fix may_commit_transaction to deal with no partial filling

Now that we aren't partially filling tickets we may have some slack
space left in the space_info.  We need to account for this in
may_commit_transaction, otherwise we may choose to not commit the
transaction despite it actually having enough space to satisfy our
ticket.

Calculate the free space we have in the space_info, if any, and subtract
this from the ticket we have and use that amount to determine if we will
need to commit to reclaim enough space.
