pinctrl: aspeed: Rename pin declaration macros

Rename macros as follows:

* s/SS_PIN_DECL()/PIN_DECL_1()/
* s/MS_PIN_DECL()/PIN_DECL_2()/
* s/MS_PIN_DECL_()/PIN_DECL_()/

This is in preparation for adding PIN_DECL_3(). We could clean this up
with e.g. CPPMAGIC_MAP() from ccan, but that might be a bridge too far
given how much of a macro jungle we already have.
