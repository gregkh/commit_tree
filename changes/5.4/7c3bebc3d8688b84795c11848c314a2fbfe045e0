cxgb4: request the TX CIDX updates to status page

For adapters which support the SGE Doorbell Queue Timer facility,
we configured the Ethernet TX Queues to send CIDX Updates to the
Associated Ethernet RX Response Queue with CPL_SGE_EGR_UPDATE
messages to allow us to respond more quickly to the CIDX Updates.
But, this was adding load to PCIe Link RX bandwidth and,
potentially, resulting in higher CPU Interrupt load.

This patch requests the HW to deliver the CIDX updates to the TX
queue status page rather than generating an ingress queue message
(as an interrupt). With this patch, the load on RX bandwidth is
reduced and a substantial improvement in BW is noticed at lower
IO sizes.
