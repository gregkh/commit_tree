i40e: check __I40E_VF_DISABLE bit in i40e_sync_filters_subtask

While testing VF spawn/destroy the following panic occurred.

BUG: unable to handle kernel NULL pointer dereference at 0000000000000029

Investigation revealed a race where pf->vf[vsi->vf_id].trusted may get
accessed by the watchdog via i40e_sync_filters_subtask() although
i40e_free_vfs() already free'd pf->vf.
To avoid this the call to i40e_sync_vsi_filters() in
i40e_sync_filters_subtask() needs to be guarded by __I40E_VF_DISABLE,
which is also used by i40e_free_vfs().

Note: put the __I40E_VF_DISABLE check after the
__I40E_MACVLAN_SYNC_PENDING check as the latter is more likely to
trigger.
