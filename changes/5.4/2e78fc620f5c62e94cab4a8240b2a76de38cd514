ixgbe: fix xdp handle calculations

Commit 7cbbf9f1fa23 ("ixgbe: fix xdp handle calculations") reintroduced
the addition of the umem headroom to the xdp handle in the ixgbe_zca_free,
ixgbe_alloc_buffer_slow_zc and ixgbe_alloc_buffer_zc functions. However,
the headroom is already added to the handle in the function
ixgbe_run_xdp_zc. This commit removes the latter addition and fixes the
case where the headroom is non-zero.
