riscv: avoid kernel hangs when trapped in BUG()

When the CONFIG_GENERIC_BUG is disabled by disabling CONFIG_BUG, if a
kernel thread is trapped by BUG(), the whole system will be in the
loop that infinitely handles the ebreak exception instead of entering the
die function. To fix this problem, the do_trap_break() will always call
the die() to deal with the break exception as the type of break is
BUG_TRAP_TYPE_BUG.
