regulator: pfuze100-regulator: Variable "val" in pfuze100_regulator_probe() could be uninitialized

In function pfuze100_regulator_probe(), variable "val" could be
initialized if regmap_read() fails. However, "val" is used to
decide the control flow later in the if statement, which is
potentially unsafe.
