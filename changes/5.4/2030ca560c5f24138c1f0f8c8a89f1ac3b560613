nfsd: degraded slot-count more gracefully as allocation nears exhaustion.

This original code in nfsd4_get_drc_mem() would hand out 30
slots (approximately NFSD_MAX_MEM_PER_SESSION bytes at slightly
over 2K per slot) to each requesting client until it ran out
of space, then it would possibly give one last client a reduced
allocation, then fail the allocation.

Since commit de766e570413 ("nfsd: give out fewer session slots as
limit approaches") the last 90 slots to be given to about 12
clients with quickly reducing slot counts (better than just 3
clients).  This still seems unnecessarily hasty.
A subsequent patch allows over-allocation so every client gets
at least one slot, but that might be a bit restrictive.

The requested number of nfsd threads is the best guide we have to the
expected number of clients, so use that - if it is at least 8.

256 threads on a 256Meg machine - which is a lot for a tiny machine -
would result in nfsd_drc_max_mem being 2Meg, so 8K (3 slots) would be
available for the first client, and over 200 clients would get more
than 1 slot.  So I don't think this change will be too debilitating on
poorly configured machines, though it does mean that a sensible
configuration is a little more important.
