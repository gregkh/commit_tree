habanalabs: Make the Coresight timestamp perpetual

The Coresight timestamp is enabled for a specific debug session using
the HL_DEBUG_OP_TIMESTAMP opcode of the debug IOCTL.
In order to have a perpetual timestamp that would be comparable between
various debug sessions, this patch moves the timestamp enablement to be
part of the HW initialization.
The HL_DEBUG_OP_TIMESTAMP opcode turns to be deprecated and shouldn't be
used. Old user-space that will call it won't see any change in the
behavior of the debug session.
