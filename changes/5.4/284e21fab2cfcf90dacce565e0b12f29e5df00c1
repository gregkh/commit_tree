x86, s390/mm: Move sme_active() and sme_me_mask to x86-specific header

Now that generic code doesn't reference them, move sme_active() and
sme_me_mask to x86's <asm/mem_encrypt.h>.

Also remove the export for sme_active() since it's only used in files that
won't be built as modules. sme_me_mask on the other hand is used in
arch/x86/kvm/svm.c (via __sme_set() and __psp_pa()) which can be built as a
module so its export needs to stay.
