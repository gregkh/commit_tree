Revert "Revert "Revert "mm, thp: consolidate THP gfp handling into alloc_hugepage_direct_gfpmask""

This reverts commit 92717d429b38e4f9f934eed7e605cc42858f1839.

Since commit a8282608c88e ("Revert "mm, thp: restore node-local hugepage
allocations"") is reverted in this series, it is better to restore the
previous 5.2 behavior between the thp allocation and the page allocator
rather than to attempt any consolidation or cleanup for a policy that is
now reverted.  It's less risky during an rc cycle and subsequent patches
in this series further modify the same policy that the pre-5.3 behavior
implements.

Consolidation and cleanup can be done subsequent to a sane default page
allocation strategy, so this patch reverts a cleanup done on a strategy
that is now reverted and thus is the least risky option.
