net: qrtr: Stop rx_worker before freeing node

As the endpoint is unregistered there might still be work pending to
handle incoming messages, which will result in a use after free
scenario. The plan is to remove the rx_worker, but until then (and for
stable@) ensure that the work is stopped before the node is freed.
