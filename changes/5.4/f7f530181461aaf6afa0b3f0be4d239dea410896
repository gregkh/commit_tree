ALSA: usb-audio: fix PCM device order

Some cards have alternate setting with non-PCM format as the first
altsetting in the interface descriptors. This confuses userspace, since
alsa-lib uses device 0 by default. So lets parse interfaces in two steps:
 1. Parse altsettings with PCM formats.
 2. Parse altsettings with non-PCM formats.

This fixes at least following cards:
 - Audinst HUD-mx2
 - Audinst HUD-mini
