firmware: add Intel Stratix10 remote system update driver

The Intel Remote System Update (RSU) driver exposes interfaces access
through the Intel Service Layer to user space via sysfs interface.
The RSU interfaces report and control some of the optional RSU features
on Intel Stratix 10 SoC.

The RSU feature provides a way for customers to update the boot
configuration of a Intel Stratix 10 SoC device with significantly reduced
risk of corrupting the bitstream storage and bricking the system.
