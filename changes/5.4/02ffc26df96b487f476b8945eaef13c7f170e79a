usb: cdns3: fix cdns3_core_init_role()

At startup we should trigger the HW state machine
only if it is OTG mode. Otherwise we should just
start the respective role.

Initialize idle role by default. If we don't do this then
cdns3_idle_role_stop() is not called when switching to
host/device role and so lane switch mechanism
doesn't work. This results to super-speed device not working
in one orientation if it was plugged before driver probe.
