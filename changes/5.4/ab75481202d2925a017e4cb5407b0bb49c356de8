ALSA: firewire-lib: pass data block counter to data block processing layer

This is a preparation for future commit that 'struct
amdtp_stream.data_block_count' does not represent the value of
data block count for current data block.

However, data block count is required for calculation of sequence index
in sequence-multiplied data channel. Some of data block processing layer
require it; e.g. for AM824 data block.

This commit passes data block count to the processing layer.
