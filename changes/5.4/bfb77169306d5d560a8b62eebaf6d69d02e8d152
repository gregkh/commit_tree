ARM: dts: exynos: Add CAM power domain to Exynos5422/5800

CAM power domain contains CAMIF, 3AA and FIMC LITE devices. It is present
only in Exynos 5422/5800 SoCs. Currently there are no drivers nor the
device nodes for those devices, but instantiating its power domain allows
to turn it off and save some energy.
