vfio-ccw: add some logging

Usually, the common I/O layer logs various things into the s390
cio debug feature, which has been very helpful in the past when
looking at crash dumps. As vfio-ccw devices unbind from the
standard I/O subchannel driver, we lose some information there.

Let's introduce some vfio-ccw debug features and log some things
there. (Unfortunately we cannot reuse the cio debug feature from
a module.)
