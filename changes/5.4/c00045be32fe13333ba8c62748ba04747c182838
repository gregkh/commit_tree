rcu/nocb: Make rcutree_migrate_callbacks() start at leaf rcu_node structure

Because rcutree_migrate_callbacks() is invoked infrequently and because
an exact snapshot of the grace-period state might save some callbacks a
second trip through a grace period, this function has used the root
rcu_node structure.  However, this safe-second-trip optimization
happens only if rcutree_migrate_callbacks() races with grace-period
initialization, so it is not worth the added mental load.  This commit
therefore makes rcutree_migrate_callbacks() start with the leaf rcu_node
structures, as is done elsewhere.
