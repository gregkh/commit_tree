crypto: api - Remove redundant #ifdef in crypto_yield()

While looking at CONFIG_PREEMPT dependencies treewide the #ifdef in
crypto_yield() matched.

CONFIG_PREEMPT and CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY are mutually exclusive so the
extra !CONFIG_PREEMPT conditional is redundant.

cond_resched() has only an effect when CONFIG_PREEMPT_VOLUNTARY is set,
otherwise it's a stub which the compiler optimizes out.

Remove the whole conditional.

No functional change.
