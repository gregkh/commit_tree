mm, vmstat: hide /proc/pagetypeinfo from normal users

/proc/pagetypeinfo is a debugging tool to examine internal page
allocator state wrt to fragmentation.  It is not very useful for any
other use so normal users really do not need to read this file.

Waiman Long has noticed that reading this file can have negative side
effects because zone->lock is necessary for gathering data and that a)
interferes with the page allocator and its users and b) can lead to hard
lockups on large machines which have very long free_list.

Reduce both issues by simply not exporting the file to regular users.
