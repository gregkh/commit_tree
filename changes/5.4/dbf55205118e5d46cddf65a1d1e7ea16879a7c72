hwmon: w83795: Fan control option isn't that dangerous

I have been using SENSORS_W83795_FANCTRL for several years and never
had any problem. When the driver was added, I had not tested that
part of the driver yet so I wanted to be super cautious, but time has
shown that it works just fine.

In the long run I even believe that we should drop the option and
enable the feature unconditionally. It doesn't do anything until the
user explicitly starts twiddling with sysfs attributes anyway.
