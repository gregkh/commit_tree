s390/qeth: collect accurate TX statistics

This consolidates the SW statistics code, and improves it to
(1) account for the header overhead of each segment on a TSO skb,
(2) count dangling packets as in-error (during eg. shutdown), and
(3) only count offloads when the skb was successfully transmitted.

We also count each segment of an TSO skb as one packet - except for
tx_dropped, to be consistent with dev->tx_dropped.
