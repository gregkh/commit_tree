iio: adc: axp288: Override TS pin bias current for some models

Since commit 9bcf15f75cac ("iio: adc: axp288: Fix TS-pin handling") we
preserve the bias current set by the firmware at boot.  This fixes issues
we were seeing on various models, but it seems our old hardcoded 80Å³A bias
current was working around a firmware bug on at least one model laptop.

In order to both have our cake and eat it, this commit adds a dmi based
list of models where we need to override the firmware set bias current and
adds the one model we now know needs this to it: The Lenovo Ideapad 100S
(11 inch version).
