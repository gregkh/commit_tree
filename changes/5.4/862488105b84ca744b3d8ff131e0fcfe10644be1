nbd: fix possible sysfs duplicate warning

1. nbd_put takes the mutex and drops nbd->ref to 0. It then does
idr_remove and drops the mutex.

2. nbd_genl_connect takes the mutex. idr_find/idr_for_each fails
to find an existing device, so it does nbd_dev_add.

3. just before the nbd_put could call nbd_dev_remove or not finished
totally, but if nbd_dev_add try to add_disk, we can hit:

debugfs: Directory 'nbd1' with parent 'block' already present!

This patch will make sure all the disk add/remove stuff are done
by holding the nbd_index_mutex lock.
