Revert "net: bcmgenet: soft reset 40nm EPHYs before MAC init"

This reverts commit 1f515486275a08a17a2c806b844cca18f7de5b34.

This commit improved the chances of the umac resetting cleanly by
ensuring that the PHY was restored to its normal operation prior
to resetting the umac. However, there were still cases when the
PHY might not be driving a Tx clock to the umac during this window
(e.g. when the PHY detects no link).

The previous commit now ensures that the unimac receives clocks
from the MAC during its reset window so this commit is no longer
needed. This commit also has an unintended negative impact on the
MDIO performance of the UniMAC MDIO interface because it is used
before the MDIO interrupts are reenabled, so it should be removed.
