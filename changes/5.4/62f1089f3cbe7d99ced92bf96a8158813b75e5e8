drm/panfrost: Flush and disable address space when freeing page tables

Currently, page tables are freed without disabling the address space first.
This probably is fine as we'll switch to new page tables when the address
space is allocated again and runtime PM suspend will reset the GPU
clearing the registers. However, it's better to clean up after ourselves.
There is also a problem that we could be accessing the h/w in
tlb_inv_context() when suspended.

Rework the disable code to make sure we flush caches/TLBs and disable the
address space before freeing the page tables if we are not suspended. As
the tlb_inv_context() hook is only called when freeing the page tables and
we do a flush before disabling the AS, lets remove the flush from
tlb_inv_context and avoid any runtime PM issues.
