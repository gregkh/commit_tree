KVM: arm/arm64: vgic-its: Invalidate MSI-LPI translation cache on specific commands

The LPI translation cache needs to be discarded when an ITS command
may affect the translation of an LPI (DISCARD, MAPC and MAPD with V=0)
or the routing of an LPI to a redistributor with disabled LPIs (MOVI,
MOVALL).

We decide to perform a full invalidation of the cache, irrespective
of the LPI that is affected. Commands are supposed to be rare enough
that it doesn't matter.
