tools headers kvm: Sync kvm headers with the kernel sources

To pick the changes in:

  200824f55eef ("KVM: s390: Disallow invalid bits in kvm_valid_regs and kvm_dirty_regs")
  4a53d99dd0c2 ("KVM: VMX: Introduce exit reason for receiving INIT signal on guest-mode")
  7396d337cfad ("KVM: x86: Return to userspace with internal error on unexpected exit reason")
  92f35b751c71 ("KVM: arm/arm64: vgic: Allow more than 256 vcpus for KVM_IRQ_LINE")

None of them trigger any changes in tooling, this time this is just to silence
these perf build warnings:
