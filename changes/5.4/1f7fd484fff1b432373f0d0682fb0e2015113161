drm/i915: Replace i915_vma_put_fence()

Avoid calling i915_vma_put_fence() by using our alternate paths that
bind a secondary vma avoiding the original fenced vma. For the few
instances where we need to release the fence (i.e. on binding when the
GGTT range becomes invalid), replace the put_fence with a revoke_fence.
