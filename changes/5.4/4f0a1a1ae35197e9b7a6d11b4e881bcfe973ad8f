memory: mtk-smi: Invoke pm runtime_callback to enable clocks

This patch only move the clk_prepare_enable and config_port into the
runtime suspend/resume callback. It doesn't change the code content
and sequence.

This is a preparing patch for adjusting SMI_BUS_SEL for mt8183.
(SMI_BUS_SEL need to be restored after smi-common resume every time.)
Also it gives a chance to get rid of mtk_smi_larb_get/put which could
be a next topic.
