nvme: Wait for reset state when required

Prevent simultaneous controller disabling/enabling tasks from interfering
with each other through a function to wait until the task successfully
transitioned the controller to the RESETTING state. This ensures disabling
the controller will not be interrupted by another reset path, otherwise
a concurrent reset may leave the controller in the wrong state.
