power: supply: axp288_fuel_gauge: Add Minix Neo Z83-4 to the blacklist

The Minix Neo Z83-4 is another mini PC using the AXP288 PMIC where the
EFI code does not disable the charger part of the PMIC causing us to report
battery readings (of always 100%) to userspace even though there is no
battery in this wall-outlet powered device.

Add it to the blacklist to avoid the bogus battery status reporting.
