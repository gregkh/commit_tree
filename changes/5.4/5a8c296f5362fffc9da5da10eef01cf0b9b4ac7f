serial: max310x: Properly set flags in AutoCTS mode

Commit 391f93f2ec9f ("serial: core: Rework hw-assisted flow control
support") has changed the way the AutoCTS mode is handled.

According to that change, serial drivers which enable H/W AutoCTS mode must
set UPSTAT_AUTORTS, UPSTAT_AUTOCTS and UPSTAT_AUTOXOFF to prevent the
serial core from inadvertently disabling RX or TX. This patch adds proper
handling of UPSTAT_AUTORTS, UPSTAT_AUTOCTS and UPSTAT_AUTOXOFF flags.
