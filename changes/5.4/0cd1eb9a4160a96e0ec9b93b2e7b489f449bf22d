fuse: separate fuse device allocation and installation in fuse_conn

As of now fuse_dev_alloc() both allocates a fuse device and installs it in
fuse_conn list.  fuse_dev_alloc() can fail if fuse_device allocation fails.

virtio-fs needs to initialize multiple fuse devices (one per virtio queue).
It initializes one fuse device as part of call to fuse_fill_super_common()
and rest of the devices are allocated and installed after that.

But, we can't afford to fail after calling fuse_fill_super_common() as we
don't have a way to undo all the actions done by fuse_fill_super_common().
So to avoid failures after the call to fuse_fill_super_common(),
pre-allocate all fuse devices early and install them into fuse connection
later.

This patch provides two separate helpers for fuse device allocation and
fuse device installation in fuse_conn.
