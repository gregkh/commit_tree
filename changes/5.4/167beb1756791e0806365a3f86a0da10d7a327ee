ALSA: usb-audio: Fix missing error check at mixer resolution test

A check of the return value from get_cur_mix_raw() is missing at the
resolution test code in get_min_max_with_quirks(), which may leave the
variable untouched, leading to a random uninitialized value, as
detected by syzkaller fuzzer.

Add the missing return error check for fixing that.
