fpga: dfl: afu: add userclock sysfs interfaces.

This patch introduces userclock sysfs interfaces for AFU, user
could use these interfaces for clock setting to AFU.

Please note that, this is only working for port header feature
with revision 0, for later revisions, userclock setting is moved
to a separated private feature, so one revision sysfs interface
is exposed to userspace application for this purpose too.
