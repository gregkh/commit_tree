arm64: dts: rdu3: add UCS1002 charge controller node

Add the charge controller node. With the controller driver loaded
the VBUS of the user USB socket is controlled exclusively via i2c
with the GPIO controls ignored, so vbus-supply for the user USB
port must be linked to the charge controller.

Hog the previously used GPIO control to unconditionally enable
VBUS until the driver is loaded.
