powerpc/book3s64/mm: Don't do tlbie fixup for some hardware revisions

The store ordering vs tlbie issue mentioned in commit
a5d4b5891c2f ("powerpc/mm: Fixup tlbie vs store ordering issue on
POWER9") is fixed for Nimbus 2.3 and Cumulus 1.3 revisions. We don't
need to apply the fixup if we are running on them

We can only do this on PowerNV. On pseries guest with KVM we still
don't support redoing the feature fixup after migration. So we should
be enabling all the workarounds needed, because whe can possibly
migrate between DD 2.3 and DD 2.2
