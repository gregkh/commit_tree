ALSA: hda - Apply AMD controller workaround for Raven platform

It's reported that the garbled sound on HP Envy x360 13z-ag000 (Ryzen
Laptop) is fixed by the same workaround applied to other AMD chips.
Update the driver_data entry for Raven (1022:15e3) to use the newly
introduced preset, AZX_DCAPS_PRESET_AMD_SB.  Since it already contains
AZX_DCAPS_PM_RUNTIME, we can drop that bit, too.
