edac: altera: Move Stratix10 SDRAM ECC to peripheral

ARM32 SoCFPGAs had separate IRQs for SDRAM. ARM64 SoCFPGAs
send all DBEs to SError so filtering by source is necessary.

The Stratix10 SDRAM ECC is a better match with the generic
Altera peripheral ECC framework because the linked list can
be searched to find the ECC block offset and printout
the DBE Address.
