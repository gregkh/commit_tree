scsi: qla2xxx: Fix stuck login session

Login session was stucked on cable pull. When FW is in the middle PRLI
PENDING + driver is in Initiator mode, driver fails to check back with FW to
see if the PRLI has completed. This patch would re-check with FW again to
make sure PRLI would complete before pushing forward with relogin.
