staging: rtl8188eu: Remove function rtw_os_indicate_scan_done()

In function rtw_indicate_scan_done, replace call to
rtw_os_indicate_scan_done with call to indicate_wx_scan_complete_event
as all that rtw_os_indicate_scan_done does is call
indicate_wx_scan_complete_event.
Remove now-unused function rtw_os_indicate_scan_done.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
