powerpc/fadump: consider f/w load area

OPAL loads kernel & initrd at 512MB offset (256MB size), also exported
as ibm,opal/dump/fw-load-area. So, if boot memory size of FADump is
less than 768MB, kernel memory to be exported as '/proc/vmcore' would
be overwritten by f/w while loading kernel & initrd. To avoid such a
scenario, enforce a minimum boot memory size of 768MB on OPAL platform
and skip using FADump if a newer F/W version loads kernel & initrd
above 768MB.

Also, irrespective of RMA size, set the minimum boot memory size
expected on pseries platform at 320MB. This is to avoid inflating the
minimum memory requirements on systems with 512M/1024M RMA size.
