lib/stackdepot: Fix outdated comments

Replace "depot_save_stack" with "stack_depot_save" in code comments because
depot_save_stack() was replaced in commit c0cfc337264c ("lib/stackdepot:
Provide functions which operate on plain storage arrays") and removed in
commit 56d8f079c51a ("lib/stackdepot: Remove obsolete functions")
