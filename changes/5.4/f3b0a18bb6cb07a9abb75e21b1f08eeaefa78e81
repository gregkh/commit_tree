net: remove unnecessary variables and callback

This patch removes variables and callback these are related to the nested
device structure.
devices that can be nested have their own nest_level variable that
represents the depth of nested devices.
In the previous patch, new {lower/upper}_level variables are added and
they replace old private nest_level variable.
So, this patch removes all 'nest_level' variables.

In order to avoid lockdep warning, ->ndo_get_lock_subclass() was added
to get lockdep subclass value, which is actually lower nested depth value.
But now, they use the dynamic lockdep key to avoid lockdep warning instead
of the subclass.
So, this patch removes ->ndo_get_lock_subclass() callback.
