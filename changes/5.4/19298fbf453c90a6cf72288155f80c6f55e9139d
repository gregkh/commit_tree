posix-cpu-timers: Provide quick sample function for itimer

get_itimer() needs a sample of the current thread group cputime. It invokes
thread_group_cputimer() - which is a misnomer. That function also starts
eventually the group cputime accouting which is bogus because the
accounting is already active when a timer is armed.
