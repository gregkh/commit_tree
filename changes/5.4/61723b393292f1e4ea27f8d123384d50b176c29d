tcp: ulp: add functions to dump ulp-specific information

currently, only getsockopt(TCP_ULP) can be invoked to know if a ULP is on
top of a TCP socket. Extend idiag_get_aux() and idiag_get_aux_size(),
introduced by commit b37e88407c1d ("inet_diag: allow protocols to provide
additional data"), to report the ULP name and other information that can
be made available by the ULP through optional functions.

Users having CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges will then be able to retrieve this
information through inet_diag_handler, if they specify INET_DIAG_INFO in
the request.
