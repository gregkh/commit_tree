KVM: LAPIC: Mark hrtimer to expire in hard interrupt context

On PREEMPT_RT enabled kernels unmarked hrtimers are moved into soft
interrupt expiry mode by default.

While that's not a functional requirement for the KVM local APIC timer
emulation, it's a latency issue which can be avoided by marking the timer
so hard interrupt context expiry is enforced.

No functional change.
