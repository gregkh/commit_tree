drm/i915/execlists: Set priority hint prior to submission

Since we now run process_csb() outside of the engine->active.lock, we
can process a CS-event immediately upon our ELSP write. As we currently
inspect the pending queue *after* the ELSP write, there is an
opportunity for a CS-event to update the pending queue before we can
read it, making ourselves chases an invalid pointer.
