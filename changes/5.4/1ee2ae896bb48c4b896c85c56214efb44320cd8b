drm/i915/hangcheck: Look at instdone for all engines

It seems intel_engine_get_instdone is able to get instdone for all engines
but intel_hangcheck.c/subunits_stuck decides to ignore it for non render.

We can just drop the check in subunits_stuck since the checks on
unavailable fields will always return stuck, which when bitwise and with
the potential unstuck instdone is harmless.
