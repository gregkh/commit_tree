soc: samsung: chipid: Fix memory leak in error path

Currently when the call to product_id_to_soc_id fails there
is a memory leak of soc_dev_attr->revision and soc_dev_attr
on the error return path.  Fix this by adding a common error
return path that frees there obects and use this for two
error return paths.
