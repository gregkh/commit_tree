btrfs: extent-tree: Add comment for inc_block_group_ro()

inc_block_group_ro() is only designed to mark one block group read-only,
it doesn't really care if other block groups have enough free space to
contain the used space in the block group.

However due to the close connection between this function and
relocation, sometimes we can be confused and think this function is
responsible for balance space reservation, which is not true.

Add some comment to make the functionality clear.
