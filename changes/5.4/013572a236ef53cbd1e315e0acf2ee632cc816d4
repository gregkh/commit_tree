net: dsa: microchip: Add shared regmap mutex

The KSZ driver uses one regmap per register width (8/16/32), each with
it's own lock, but accessing the same set of registers. In theory, it
is possible to create a race condition between these regmaps, although
the underlying bus (SPI or I2C) locking should assure nothing bad will
really happen and the accesses would be correct.

To make the driver do the right thing, add one single shared mutex for
all the regmaps used by the driver instead. This assures that even if
some future hardware is on a bus which does not serialize the accesses
the same way SPI or I2C does, nothing bad will happen.

Note that the status_mutex was unused and only initied, hence it was
renamed and repurposed as the regmap mutex.
