staging: rtl8188eu: remove redundant assignment to variable rtstatus

Variable rtstatus is being initialized with a value that is never read
and rtstatus is being re-assigned a little later on. The assignment is
redundant and hence can be removed.  Also, make rtstatus a bool to
match the function return type.
