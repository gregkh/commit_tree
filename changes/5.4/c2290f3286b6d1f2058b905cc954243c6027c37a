kbuild: fix modkern_aflags implementation

For the single target building %.symtypes from %.S, $(a_flags) is
expanded into the _KERNEL flags even if the object is a part of a
module.

$(real-obj-m:.o=.symtypes): modkern_aflags := $(KBUILD_AFLAGS_MODULE) $(AFLAGS_MODULE)

... would fix the issue, but it is not nice to duplicate similar code
for every suffix.

Implement modkern_aflags in the same way as modkern_cflags.
