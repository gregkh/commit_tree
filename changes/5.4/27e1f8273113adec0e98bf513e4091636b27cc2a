khugepaged: enable collapse pmd for pte-mapped THP

khugepaged needs exclusive mmap_sem to access page table.  When it fails
to lock mmap_sem, the page will fault in as pte-mapped THP.  As the page
is already a THP, khugepaged will not handle this pmd again.

This patch enables the khugepaged to retry collapse the page table.

struct mm_slot (in khugepaged.c) is extended with an array, containing
addresses of pte-mapped THPs.  We use array here for simplicity.  We can
easily replace it with more advanced data structures when needed.

In khugepaged_scan_mm_slot(), if the mm contains pte-mapped THP, we try to
collapse the page table.

Since collapse may happen at an later time, some pages may already fault
in.  collapse_pte_mapped_thp() is added to properly handle these pages.
collapse_pte_mapped_thp() also double checks whether all ptes in this pmd
are mapping to the same THP.  This is necessary because some subpage of
the THP may be replaced, for example by uprobe.  In such cases, it is not
possible to collapse the pmd.
