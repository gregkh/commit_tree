net: hns3: fix a wrong reset interrupt status mask

According to hardware user manual, bits5~7 in register
HCLGE_MISC_VECTOR_INT_STS means reset interrupts status,
but HCLGE_RESET_INT_M is defined as bits0~2 now. So it
will make hclge_reset_err_handle() read the wrong reset
interrupt status.

This patch fixes this wrong bit mask.
