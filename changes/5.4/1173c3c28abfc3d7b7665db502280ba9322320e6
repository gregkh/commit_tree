Revert "gpio: merrifield: Pass irqchip when adding gpiochip"

This reverts commit 8f86a5b4ad679e4836733b47414226074eee4e4d.

It has been established that this causes a boot regression on
both Baytrail and Cherrytrail SoCs, and we can't have that in
the final kernel release, so we need to revert it.
