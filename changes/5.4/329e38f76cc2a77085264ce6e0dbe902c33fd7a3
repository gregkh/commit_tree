selftest/bpf: centralize libbpf logging management for test_progs

Make test_progs test runner own libbpf logging. Also introduce two
levels of verbosity: -v and -vv. First one will be used in subsequent
patches to enable test log output always. Second one increases verbosity
level of libbpf logging further to include debug output as well.
