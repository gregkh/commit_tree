ASoC: dmaengine: Make the pcm->name equal to pcm->id if the name is not set

Some tools use the snd_pcm_info_get_name() to try to identify PCMs or for
other purposes.

Currently it is left empty with the dmaengine-pcm, in this case copy the
pcm->id string as pcm->name.

For example IGT is using this to find the HDMI PCM for testing audio on it.
