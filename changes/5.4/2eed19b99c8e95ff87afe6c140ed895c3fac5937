staging: bcm2835-audio: Fix draining behavior regression

The PCM draining behavior got broken since the recent refactoring, and
this turned out to be the incorrect expectation of the firmware
behavior regarding "draining".  While I expected the "drain" flag at
the stop operation would do processing the queued samples, it seems
rather dropping the samples.

As a quick fix, just drop the SNDRV_PCM_INFO_DRAIN_TRIGGER flag, so
that the driver uses the normal PCM draining procedure.  Also, put
some caution comment to the function for future readers not to fall
into the same pitfall.
