Drivers: hv: vmbus: Suspend after cleaning up hv_sock and sub channels

Before suspend, Linux must make sure all the hv_sock channels have been
properly cleaned up, because a hv_sock connection can not persist across
hibernation, and the user-space app must be properly notified of the
state change of the connection.

Before suspend, Linux also must make sure all the sub-channels have been
destroyed, i.e. the related channel structs of the sub-channels must be
properly removed, otherwise they would cause a conflict when the
sub-channels are recreated upon resume.

Add a counter to track such channels, and vmbus_bus_suspend() should wait
for the counter to drop to zero.
