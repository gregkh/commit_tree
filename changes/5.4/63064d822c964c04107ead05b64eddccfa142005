drm/i915/uc: Move uC WOPCM setup in uc_init_hw

The register we write are not WOPCM regs but uC ones related to how
GuC and HuC are going to use the WOPCM, so it makes logical sense
for them to be programmed as part of uc_init_hw. The WOPCM map on the
other side is not uC-specific (although that is our main use-case), so
keep that separate.

v2: move write_and_verify to uncore, fix log, re-use err_out tag,
    add intel_wopcm_guc_base, fix log
