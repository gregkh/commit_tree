HID: fix error message in hid_open_report()

On HID report descriptor parsing error the code displays bogus
pointer instead of error offset (subtracts start=NULL from end).
Make the message more useful by displaying correct error offset
and include total buffer size for reference.

This was carried over from ancient times - "Fixed" commit just
promoted the message from DEBUG to ERROR.
