powerpc/fadump: release all the memory above boot memory size

Except for Reserved dump area (see Documentation/powerpc/firmware-
assisted-dump.rst) which is permanent reserved, all memory above boot
memory size, where boot memory size is the memory required for the
kernel to boot successfully when booted with restricted memory (memory
for capture kernel), is released when the dump is invalidated. Make
this a bit more explicit in the code.
