tracing/dynevent: Delete all matched events

When user gives an event name to delete, delete all
matched events instead of the first one.

This means if there are several events which have same
name but different group (subsystem) name, those are
removed if user passed only the event name, e.g.

  # cat kprobe_events
  p:group1/testevent _do_fork
  p:group2/testevent fork_idle
  # echo -:testevent >> kprobe_events
  # cat kprobe_events
  #
