nfp: flower: verify pre-tunnel rules

Pre-tunnel rules must direct packets to an internal port based on L2
information. Rules that egress to an internal port are already indicated
by a non-NULL device in its nfp_fl_payload struct. Verfiy the rest of the
match fields indicate that the rule is a pre-tunnel rule. This requires a
full match on the destination MAC address, an option VLAN field, and no
specific matches on other lower layer fields (with the exception of L4
proto and flags).

If a rule is identified as a pre-tunnel rule then mark it for offload to
the pre-tunnel table. Similarly, remove it from the pre-tunnel table on
rule deletion. The actual offloading of these commands is left to a
following patch.
