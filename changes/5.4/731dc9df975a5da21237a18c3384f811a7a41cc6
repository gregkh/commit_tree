cpu/speculation: Uninline and export CPU mitigations helpers

A kernel module may need to check the value of the "mitigations=" kernel
command line parameter as part of its setup when the module needs
to perform software mitigations for a CPU flaw.

Uninline and export the helper functions surrounding the cpu_mitigations
enum to allow for their usage from a module.

Lastly, privatize the enum and cpu_mitigations variable since the value of
cpu_mitigations can be checked with the exported helper functions.
