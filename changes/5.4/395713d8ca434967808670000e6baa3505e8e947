soundwire: intel: handle disabled links

On most hardware platforms, SoundWire interfaces are pin-muxed with
other interfaces (typically DMIC or I2S) and the status of each link
needs to be checked at boot time.

For Intel platforms, the BIOS provides a menu to enable/disable the
links separately, and the information is provided to the OS with an
Intel-specific _DSD property. The same capability will be added to
revisions of the MIPI DisCo specification.
