ALSA: usb-audio: not submit urb for stopped endpoint

While output urb's snd_complete_urb() is executing, calling
prepare_outbound_urb() may cause endpoint stopped before
prepare_outbound_urb() returns and result in next urb submitted
to stopped endpoint. usb-audio driver cannot re-use it afterwards as
the urb is still hold by usb stack.

This change checks EP_FLAG_RUNNING flag after prepare_outbound_urb() again
to let snd_complete_urb() know the endpoint already stopped and does not
submit next urb. Below kind of error will be fixed:

[  213.153103] usb 1-2: timeout: still 1 active urbs on EP #1
[  213.164121] usb 1-2: cannot submit urb 0, error -16: unknown error
