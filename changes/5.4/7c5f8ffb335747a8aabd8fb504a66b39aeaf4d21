s390/qeth: use correct length field in SNMP cmd callback

qeth_snmp_command_cb() is the only cmd callback that pulls the reply's
data length from a low-level transport header field. This requires
additional complexity (ie. reply->offset) to make the header accessible
to what is supposed to be a pure IPA cmd callback.

Adapter cmds have a length field in their sub-cmd header, get the data
length from there instead.
