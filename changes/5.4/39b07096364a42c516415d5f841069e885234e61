ima: Implement support for module-style appended signatures

Implement the appraise_type=imasig|modsig option, allowing IMA to read and
verify modsig signatures.

In case a file has both an xattr signature and an appended modsig, IMA will
only use the appended signature if the key used by the xattr signature
isn't present in the IMA or platform keyring.

Because modsig verification needs to convert from an integrity keyring id
to the keyring itself, add an integrity_keyring_from_id() function in
digsig.c so that integrity_modsig_verify() can use it.
