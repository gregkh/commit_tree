s390/kasan: avoid report in get_wchan

Reading other running task's stack can be a dangerous endeavor. Kasan
stack memory access instrumentation includes special prologue and epilogue
to mark/remove red zones in shadow memory between stack variables. For
that reason there is always a race between a task reading value in other
task's stack and that other task returning from a function and entering
another one generating different red zones pattern.

To avoid kasan reports simply perform uninstrumented memory reads.
