pinctrl: tegra: Fix write barrier placement in pmx_writel

pmx_writel uses writel which inserts write barrier before the
register write.

This patch has fix to replace writel with writel_relaxed followed
by a readback and memory barrier to ensure write operation is
completed for successful pinctrl change.
