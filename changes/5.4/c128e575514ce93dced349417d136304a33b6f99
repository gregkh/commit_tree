NFS: Optimise the default readahead size

In the years since the max readahead size was fixed in NFS, a number of
things have happened:
- Users can now set the value directly using /sys/class/bdi
- NFS max supported block sizes have increased by several orders of
  magnitude from 64K to 1MB.
- Disk access latencies are orders of magnitude faster due to SSD + NVME.

In particular note that if the server is advertising 1MB as the optimal
read size, as that will set the readahead size to 15MB.
Let's therefore adjust down, and try to default to VM_READAHEAD_PAGES.
However let's inform the VM about our preferred block size so that it
can choose to round up in cases where that makes sense.
