riscv: mark some code and data as file-static

Several functions and arrays which are only used in the files in which
they are declared are missing "static" qualifiers.  Warnings for these
symbols are reported by sparse:

arch/riscv/kernel/vdso.c:28:18: warning: symbol 'vdso_data' was not declared. Should it be static?
arch/riscv/mm/sifive_l2_cache.c:145:12: warning: symbol 'sifive_l2_init' was not declared. Should it be static?

Resolve these warnings by marking them as static.
