csky: Fixup dma_alloc_coherent with PAGE_SO attribute

This bug is from commit: 2b070ccdf8c0 (fixup abiv2 mmap(... O_SYNC)
failed). In that patch we remove the _PAGE_SO for memory noncache
mapping and this will cause problem when drivers use dma descriptors
to control the transcations without dma_w/rmb().

After referencing other archs' implementation, pgprot_writecombine is
introduced for mmap(... O_SYNC).
