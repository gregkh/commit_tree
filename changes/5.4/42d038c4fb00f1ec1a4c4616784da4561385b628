arm64: Add support for function error injection

Inspired by the commit 7cd01b08d35f ("powerpc: Add support for function
error injection"), this patch supports function error injection for
Arm64.

This patch mainly support two functions: one is regs_set_return_value()
which is used to overwrite the return value; the another function is
override_function_with_return() which is to override the probed
function returning and jump to its caller.
