nvme: make nvme_identify_ns propagate errors back

right now callers of nvme_identify_ns only know that it failed,
but don't know why. Make nvme_identify_ns propagate the error back.
Because nvme_submit_sync_cmd may return a positive status code, we
make nvme_identify_ns receive the id by reference and return that
status up the call chain, but make sure not to leak positive nvme
status codes to the upper layers.
