ext4: Reduce ext4 timestamp warnings

When ext4 file systems were created intentionally with 128 byte inodes,
the rate-limited warning of eventual possible timestamp overflow are
still emitted rather frequently.  Remove the warning for now.

Discussion for whether any warning is needed,
and where it should be emitted, can be found at
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/1567523922.5576.57.camel@lca.pw/.
I can post a separate follow-up patch after the conclusion.
