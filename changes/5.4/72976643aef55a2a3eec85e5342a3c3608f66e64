mmc: sdhci-of-aspeed: Depend on CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS

Resolves the following build error reported by the 0-day bot:

    ERROR: "of_platform_device_create" [drivers/mmc/host/sdhci-of-aspeed.ko] undefined!

SPARC does not set CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS so the symbol is missing. Depend on
CONFIG_OF_ADDRESS to ensure the driver is only built for supported
configurations.
