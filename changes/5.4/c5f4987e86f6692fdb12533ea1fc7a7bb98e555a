btrfs: fix uninitialized ret in ref-verify

Coverity caught a case where we could return with a uninitialized value
in ret in process_leaf.  This is actually pretty likely because we could
very easily run into a block group item key and have a garbage value in
ret and think there was an errror.  Fix this by initializing ret to 0.
