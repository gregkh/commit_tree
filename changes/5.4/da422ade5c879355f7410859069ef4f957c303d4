Documentation/features/locking: update lists

The locking feature lists don't match reality as of v5.3-rc1:

* arm64 moved to queued spinlocks in commit:
  c11090474d70590170cf5fa6afe85864ab494b37
  ("arm64: locking: Replace ticket lock implementation with qspinlock")

* xtensa moved to queued spinlocks and rwlocks in commit:
  579afe866f52adcd921272a224ab36733051059c
  ("xtensa: use generic spinlock/rwlock implementation")

* architecture-specific rwsem support was removed in commit:
  46ad0840b1584b92b5ff2cc3ed0b011dd6b8e0f1
  ("locking/rwsem: Remove arch specific rwsem files")

So update the feature lists accordingly, and remove the now redundant
rwsem-optimized list.
