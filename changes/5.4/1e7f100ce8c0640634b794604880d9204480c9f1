drm/amd/display: fix trigger not generated for freesync

[Why]
In newer hardware MANUAL_FLOW_CONTROL is not a trigger bit. Due to this
front porch is fixed and in these hardware freesync does not work.

[How]
Change the programming to generate a pulse so that the event will be
triggered, front porch will be cut short and freesync will work.
