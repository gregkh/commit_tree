posix-cpu-timers: Make expiry checks array based

The expiry cache is an array indexed by clock ids. The new sample functions
allow to retrieve a corresponding array of samples.

Convert the fastpath expiry checks to make use of the new sample functions
and do the comparisons on the sample and the expiry array.

Make the check for the expiry array being zero array based as well.
