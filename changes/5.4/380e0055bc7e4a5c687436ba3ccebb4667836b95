KVM: nVMX: trace nested VM-Enter failures detected by H/W

Use the recently added tracepoint for logging nested VM-Enter failures
instead of spamming the kernel log when hardware detects a consistency
check failure.  Take the opportunity to print the name of the error code
instead of dumping the raw hex number, but limit the symbol table to
error codes that can reasonably be encountered by KVM.

Add an equivalent tracepoint in nested_vmx_check_vmentry_hw(), e.g. so
that tracing of "invalid control field" errors isn't suppressed when
nested early checks are enabled.
