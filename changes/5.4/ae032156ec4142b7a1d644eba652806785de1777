ASoC: rt5677: Revert remove superfluous set

Commit 4dc057a786dc23 ("ASoC: rt5677: remove superfluous set") was an
attempted code cleanup but was incorrectly tested before sent and
actually breaks the interrupt since it never resets the value on each
loop now. The breakage is most testable when hotwording code is added
and also uses the interrupt.
