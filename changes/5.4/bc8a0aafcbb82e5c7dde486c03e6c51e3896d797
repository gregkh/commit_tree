KVM: x86: Relocate MMIO exit stats counting

Move the stat.mmio_exits update into x86_emulate_instruction().  This is
both a bug fix, e.g. the current update flows will incorrectly increment
mmio_exits on emulation failure, and a preparatory change to set the
stage for eliminating EMULATE_DONE and company.
