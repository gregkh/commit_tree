media: atmel: atmel-isi: fix timeout value for stop streaming

In case of sensor malfunction, stop streaming timeout takes much longer
than expected. This is due to conversion of time to jiffies: milliseconds
multiplied with HZ (ticks/second) gives out a value of jiffies with 10^3
greater. We need to also divide by 10^3 to obtain the right jiffies value.
In other words FRAME_INTERVAL_MILLI_SEC must be in seconds in order to
multiply by HZ and get the right jiffies value to add to the current
jiffies for the timeout expire time.
