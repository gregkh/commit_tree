Documentation/process: Clarify disclosure rules

The role of the contact list provided by the disclosing party and how it
affects the disclosure process and the ability to include experts into
the development process is not really well explained.

Neither is it entirely clear when the disclosing party will be informed
about the fact that a developer who is not covered by an employer NDA needs
to be brought in and disclosed.

Explain the role of the contact list and the information policy along with
an eventual conflict resolution better.
