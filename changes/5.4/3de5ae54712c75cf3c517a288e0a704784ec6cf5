net: phy: Fix "link partner" information disappear issue

Some drivers just call phy_ethtool_ksettings_set() to set the
links, for those phy drivers that use genphy_read_status(), if
autoneg is on, and the link is up, than execute "ethtool -s
ethx autoneg on" will cause "link partner" information disappear.

The call trace is phy_ethtool_ksettings_set()->phy_start_aneg()
->linkmode_zero(phydev->lp_advertising)->genphy_read_status(),
the link didn't change, so genphy_read_status() just return, and
phydev->lp_advertising is zero now.

This patch moves the clear operation of lp_advertising from
phy_start_aneg() to genphy_read_lpa()/genphy_c45_read_lpa(), and
if autoneg on and autoneg not complete, just clear what the
generic functions care about.
