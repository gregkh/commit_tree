ASoC: soc-core: remove unneeded dai_link check from snd_soc_remove_dai_link()

snd_soc_remove_dai_link() has card connected dai_link check. but
	1) we need to call list_del() anyway,
	   because it is "remove" function,
	2) It is doing many thing for this card / dai_link already
	   before checking dai_link.

This patch removes poinless dai_link check
