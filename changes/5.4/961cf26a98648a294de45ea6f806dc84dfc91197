powerpc/fadump: add helper functions

Add helper functions to setup & free CPU notes buffer and to find if a
given memory area is contiguous. Also, use boolean as return type for
the function that finds if boot memory area is contiguous. While at
it, save the virtual address of CPU notes buffer instead of physical
address as virtual address is used often.
