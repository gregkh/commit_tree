powerpc/64s/exception: simplify machine check early path

machine_check_handle_early_common can reach machine_check_handle_early
directly now that it runs at the relocated address, so just branch
directly.

The rfi sequence is required to enable MSR[ME] but that step is moved
into a helper function, making the code easier to follow.
