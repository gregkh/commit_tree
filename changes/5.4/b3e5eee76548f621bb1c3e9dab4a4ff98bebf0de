iommu/mediatek: Add larb-id remapped support

The larb-id may be remapped in the smi-common, this means the
larb-id reported in the mtk_iommu_isr isn't the real larb-id,

Take mt8183 as a example:
                       M4U
                        |
---------------------------------------------
|               SMI common                  |
-0-----7-----5-----6-----1-----2------3-----4- <- Id remapped
 |     |     |     |     |     |      |     |
larb0 larb1 IPU0  IPU1 larb4 larb5  larb6  CCU
disp  vdec  img   cam   venc  img    cam
As above, larb0 connects with the id 0 in smi-common.
          larb1 connects with the id 7 in smi-common.
          ...
If the larb-id reported in the isr is 7, actually it's larb1(vdec).
In order to output the right larb-id in the isr, we add a larb-id
remapping relationship in this patch.

If there is no this larb-id remapping in some SoCs, use the linear
mapping array instead.

This also is a preparing patch for mt8183.
