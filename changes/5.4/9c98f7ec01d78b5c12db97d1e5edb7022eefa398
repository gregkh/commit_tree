net/mlx5e: Add missing capability bit check for IP-in-IP

Device that doesn't support IP-in-IP offloads has to filter csum and gso
offload support, otherwise kernel will conclude that device is capable of
offloading csum and gso for IP-in-IP tunnels and that might result in
IP-in-IP tunnel not functioning.
