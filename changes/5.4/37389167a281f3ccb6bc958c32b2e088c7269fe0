mm, page_owner: keep owner info when freeing the page

For debugging purposes it might be useful to keep the owner info even
after page has been freed, and include it in e.g.  dump_page() when
detecting a bad page state.  For that, change the PAGE_EXT_OWNER flag
meaning to "page owner info has been set at least once" and add new
PAGE_EXT_OWNER_ACTIVE for tracking whether page is supposed to be
currently tracked allocated or free.  Adjust dump_page() accordingly,
distinguishing free and allocated pages.  In the page_owner debugfs file,
keep printing only allocated pages so that existing scripts are not
confused, and also because free pages are irrelevant for the memory
statistics or leak detection that's the typical use case of the file,
anyway.
