net/flow_dissector: switch to siphash

UDP IPv6 packets auto flowlabels are using a 32bit secret
(static u32 hashrnd in net/core/flow_dissector.c) and
apply jhash() over fields known by the receivers.

Attackers can easily infer the 32bit secret and use this information
to identify a device and/or user, since this 32bit secret is only
set at boot time.

Really, using jhash() to generate cookies sent on the wire
is a serious security concern.

Trying to change the rol32(hash, 16) in ip6_make_flowlabel() would be
a dead end. Trying to periodically change the secret (like in sch_sfq.c)
could change paths taken in the network for long lived flows.

Let's switch to siphash, as we did in commit df453700e8d8
("inet: switch IP ID generator to siphash")

Using a cryptographically strong pseudo random function will solve this
privacy issue and more generally remove other weak points in the stack.

Packet schedulers using skb_get_hash_perturb() benefit from this change.
