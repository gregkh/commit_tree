ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Initialize HDA controller after i915 init

On some platforms, sound card registration fails when a HDMI
monitor is not connected. This is caused by a recent commit
that switched the order in which the HDA controller and the
i915 are initialized. Initializing the i915 before initializing
the HDA controller fixes the problem.
