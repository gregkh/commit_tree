block: annotate refault stalls from IO submission

psi tracks the time tasks wait for refaulting pages to become
uptodate, but it does not track the time spent submitting the IO. The
submission part can be significant if backing storage is contended or
when cgroup throttling (io.latency) is in effect - a lot of time is
spent in submit_bio(). In that case, we underreport memory pressure.

Annotate submit_bio() to account submission time as memory stall when
the bio is reading userspace workingset pages.
