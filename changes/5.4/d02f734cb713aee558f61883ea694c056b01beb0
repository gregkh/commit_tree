ice: add support for enabling/disabling single queues

Refactor the queue handling functions that are going through queue
arrays in a way that the logic done for a single queue is pulled out and
it will be called for each ring when traversing ring array. This implies
that when disabling Tx rings we won't fill up q_ids, q_teids and
q_handles arrays.  Drop also 'offset' parameter; the value from vsi's
txq_map is stored in ring->reg_idx and that drops the need for mentioned
parameter. Introduce the ice_vsi_cfg_txq, ice_vsi_stop_tx_ring and
ice_vsi_ctrl_rx_ring that are the functions with pulled out logic.

There's several Tx queue meta data (q_id, q_handle, q_teid and other)
that need to be set up during Tx queue disablement, so let's as well add
a helper structure that wraps it up and a function that will be filling
it up.
