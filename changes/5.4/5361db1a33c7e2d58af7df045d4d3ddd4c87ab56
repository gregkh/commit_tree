drm/i915: Track i915_active using debugobjects

Provide runtime asserts and tracking of i915_active via debugobjects.
For example, this should allow us to check that the i915_active is only
active when we expect it to be and is never freed too early.

One consequence is that, for simplicity, we no longer allow i915_active
to be on-stack which only affected the selftests.
