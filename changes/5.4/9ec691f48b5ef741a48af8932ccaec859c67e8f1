dmaengine: tegra210-adma: fix transfer failure

>From Tegra186 onwards OUTSTANDING_REQUESTS field is added in channel
configuration register(bits 7:4) which defines the maximum number of reads
from the source and writes to the destination that may be outstanding at
any given point of time. This field must be programmed with a value
between 1 and 8. A value of 0 will prevent any transfers from happening.

Thus added 'has_outstanding_reqs' bool member in chip data structure and is
set to false for Tegra210, since the field is not applicable. For Tegra186
it is set to true and channel configuration is updated with maximum
outstanding requests.
