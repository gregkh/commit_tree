s390/cmm: fix information leak in cmm_timeout_handler()

The problem is that we were putting the NUL terminator too far:

	buf[sizeof(buf) - 1] = '\0';

If the user input isn't NUL terminated and they haven't initialized the
whole buffer then it leads to an info leak.  The NUL terminator should
be:

	buf[len - 1] = '\0';
