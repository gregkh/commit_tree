driver core: initialize a default DMA mask for platform device

We still treat devices without a DMA mask as defaulting to 32-bits for
both mask, but a few releases ago we've started warning about such
cases, as they require special cases to work around this sloppyness.
Add a dma_mask field to struct platform_device so that we can initialize
the dma_mask pointer in struct device and initialize both masks to
32-bits by default, replacing similar functionality in m68k and
powerpc.  The arch_setup_pdev_archdata hooks is now unused and removed.

Note that the code looks a little odd with the various conditionals
because we have to support platform_device structures that are
statically allocated.
