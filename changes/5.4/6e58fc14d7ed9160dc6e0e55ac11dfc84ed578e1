staging: exfat: Use kvzalloc() instead of kzalloc() for exfat_sb_info

Fix mount failed "Cannot allocate memory".

When the memory gets fragmented, kzalloc() might fail to allocate
physically contiguous pages for the struct exfat_sb_info (its size is
about 34KiB) even the total free memory is enough.
Use kvzalloc() to solve this problem.
