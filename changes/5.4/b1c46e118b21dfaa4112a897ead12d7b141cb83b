Revert "of/platform: Create device links for all child-supplier depencencies"

This reverts commit 709fb8297358f08a125b770d1518a95d03b541db.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
