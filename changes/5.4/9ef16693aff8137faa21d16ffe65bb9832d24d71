ftrace: Get a reference counter for the trace_array on filter files

The ftrace set_ftrace_filter and set_ftrace_notrace files are specific for
an instance now. They need to take a reference to the instance otherwise
there could be a race between accessing the files and deleting the instance.

It wasn't until the :mod: caching where these file operations started
referencing the trace_array directly.
