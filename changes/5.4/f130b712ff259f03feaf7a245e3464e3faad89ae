drm/i915: Serialise read/write of the barrier's engine

We use the request pointer inside the i915_active_node as the indicator
of the barrier's status; we mark it as used during
i915_request_add_active_barriers(), and search for an available barrier
in reuse_idle_barrier(). That check must be carefully serialised to
ensure we do use an engine for the barrier and not just a random
pointer. (Along the other reuse path, we are fully serialised by the
timeline->mutex.) The acquisition of the barrier itself is ordered through
the strong memory barrier in llist_del_all().
