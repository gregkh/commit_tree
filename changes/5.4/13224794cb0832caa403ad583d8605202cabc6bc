mm: remove quicklist page table caches

Patch series "mm: remove quicklist page table caches".

A while ago Nicholas proposed to remove quicklist page table caches [1].

I've rebased his patch on the curren upstream and switched ia64 and sh to
use generic versions of PTE allocation.

This patch (of 3):

Remove page table allocator "quicklists".  These have been around for a
long time, but have not got much traction in the last decade and are only
used on ia64 and sh architectures.

The numbers in the initial commit look interesting but probably don't
apply anymore.  If anybody wants to resurrect this it's in the git
history, but it's unhelpful to have this code and divergent allocator
behaviour for minor archs.

Also it might be better to instead make more general improvements to page
allocator if this is still so slow.
