ARM: remove ks8695 platform

ks8695 is an older SoC originally made by Kendin, which was later acquired
by Micrel, and subsequently by Microchip.

The platform port was originally contributed by Andrew Victor and Ben
Dooks, and later maintained by Greg Ungerer.

When I recently submitted cleanups, but Greg noted that the platform no
longer boots and nobody is using it any more, we decided to remove it.
