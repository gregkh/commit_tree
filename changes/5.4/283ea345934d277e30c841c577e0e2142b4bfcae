coccinelle: api/devm_platform_ioremap_resource: remove useless script

While it is useful for new drivers to use devm_platform_ioremap_resource,
this script is currently used to spam maintainers, often updating very
old drivers.  The net benefit is the removal of 2 lines of code in the
driver but the review load for the maintainers is huge.  As of now, more
that 560 patches have been sent, some of them obviously broken, as in:

Remove the script to reduce the spam.
