KVM: x86: Don't attempt VMWare emulation on #GP with non-zero error code

The VMware backdoor hooks #GP faults on IN{S}, OUT{S}, and RDPMC, none
of which generate a non-zero error code for their #GP.  Re-injecting #GP
instead of attempting emulation on a non-zero error code will allow a
future patch to move #GP injection (for emulation failure) into
kvm_emulate_instruction() without having to plumb in the error code.
