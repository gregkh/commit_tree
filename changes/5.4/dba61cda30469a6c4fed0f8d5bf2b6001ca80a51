Drivers: hv: vmbus: Break out synic enable and disable operations

Break out synic enable and disable operations into separate
hv_synic_disable_regs() and hv_synic_enable_regs() functions for use by a
later patch to support hibernation.

There is no functional change except the unnecessary check
"if (sctrl.enable != 1) return -EFAULT;" which is removed, because when
we're in hv_synic_cleanup(), we're absolutely sure sctrl.enable must be 1.
