USB: add support for dev_groups to struct usb_device_driver

Now that the driver core supports dev_groups for individual drivers,
expose that pointer to struct usb_device_driver to make it easier for USB
drivers to also use it.

Yes, users of usb_device_driver are much rare, but there are instances
already that use custom sysfs files, so adding this support will make
things easier for those drivers.  usbip is one example, hubs might be
another one.
