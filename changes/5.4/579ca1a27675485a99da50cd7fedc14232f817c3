powerpc/fadump: make use of memblock's bottom up allocation mode

Earlier, memblock_find_in_range() was not used to find the memory to
be reserved for FADump as bottom up allocation mode was not supported.
But since commit 79442ed189acb8b ("mm/memblock.c: introduce bottom-up
allocation mode") bottom up allocation mode is supported for memblock.
So, use it to find the memory to be reserved for FADump.
