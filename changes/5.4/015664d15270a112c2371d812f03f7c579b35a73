USB: rio500: Remove Rio 500 kernel driver

The Rio500 kernel driver has not been used by Rio500 owners since 2001
not long after the rio500 project added support for a user-space USB stack
through the very first versions of usbdevfs and then libusb.

Support for the kernel driver was removed from the upstream utilities
in 2008:
