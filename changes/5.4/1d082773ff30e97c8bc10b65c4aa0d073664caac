modpost: add support for generating namespace dependencies

This patch adds an option to modpost to generate a <module>.ns_deps file
per module, containing the namespace dependencies for that module.

E.g. if the linked module my-module.ko would depend on the symbol
myfunc.MY_NS in the namespace MY_NS, the my-module.ns_deps file created
by modpost would contain the entry MY_NS to express the namespace
dependency of my-module imposed by using the symbol myfunc.

These files can subsequently be used by static analysis tools (like
coccinelle scripts) to address issues with missing namespace imports. A
later patch of this series will introduce such a script 'nsdeps' and a
corresponding make target to automatically add missing
MODULE_IMPORT_NS() definitions to the module's sources. For that it uses
the information provided in the generated .ns_deps files.
