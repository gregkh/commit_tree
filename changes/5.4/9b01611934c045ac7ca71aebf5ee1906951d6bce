perf ui: Introduce non-interactive ui__info_window() function

Sometimes we want just to print a message on the center of the screen,
like in 'perf top' while we wait for the minimum amount of samples to be
collected before sorting and showing them.

Also expose __ui__info_window() as an optimization for cases where such
message is to be printed while holding the ui lock.
