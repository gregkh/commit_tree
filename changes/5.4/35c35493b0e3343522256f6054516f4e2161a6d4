printk: Replace strncmp() with str_has_prefix()

strncmp(str, const, len) is error-prone because len is easy to have typo.
An example is the hard-coded len has counting error or sizeof(const)
forgets - 1.

So we prefer using newly introduced str_has_prefix() to substitute
such strncmp() to make code better.
