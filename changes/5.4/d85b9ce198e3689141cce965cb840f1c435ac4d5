pwm: atmel: Remove unneeded check for match data

Since the driver is now exclusively DT, it only binds if it finds a
match in the of_device_id table. But in that case the associated data
can never be NULL, so drop the unnecessary check.

While at it, drop the extra local variable and store the pointer to
this per-SoC data in the driver data directly.
