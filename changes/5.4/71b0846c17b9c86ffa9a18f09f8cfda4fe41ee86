drm/i915/guc: Remove preemption support for current fw

Preemption via GuC submission is not being supported with its current
legacy incarnation. The current FW does support a similar pre-emption
flow via H2G, but it is class-based instead of being instance-based,
which doesn't fit well with the i915 tracking. To fix this, the
firmware is being updated to better support our needs with a new flow,
so we can safely remove the old code.

v2 (Daniele): resurrect & rebase, reword commit message, remove
preempt_context as well
