hwmon: (ina3221) Fix read timeout issue

After introducing "samples" to the calculation of wait time, the
driver might timeout at the regmap_field_read_poll_timeout call,
because the wait time could be longer than the 100000 usec limit
due to a large "samples" number.

So this patch sets the timeout limit to 2 times of the wait time
in order to fix this issue.
