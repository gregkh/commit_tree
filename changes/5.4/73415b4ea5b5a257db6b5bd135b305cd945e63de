drm/fb: remove unused function: drm_gem_fbdev_fb_create()

After migrating several drivers to the generic fbdev
emulation there are no users left of drm_gem_fbdev_fb_create.
Delete the function.

Noticed that there was no callers while browsing
around in the drm_fb* code.

The code that referenced the function was removed by:
commit 13aff184ed9f ("drm/qxl: remove dead qxl fbdev emulation code")

The actual use was removed by:
commit 26d4707d445d ("drm/qxl: use generic fbdev emulation")

v2:
- Updated changelog based on feedback from Noralf
