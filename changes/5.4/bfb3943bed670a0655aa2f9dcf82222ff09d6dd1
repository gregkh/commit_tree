Revert "driver core: Add support for linking devices during device addition"

This reverts commit 5302dd7dd0b6d04c63cdce51d1e9fda9ef0be886.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
