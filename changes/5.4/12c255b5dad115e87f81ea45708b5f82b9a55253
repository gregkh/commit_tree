drm/i915: Provide an i915_active.acquire callback

If we introduce a callback for i915_active that is only called the first
time we use the i915_active and is symmetrically paired with the
i915_active.retire callback, we can replace the open-coded and
non-atomic implementations -- which will be very fragile (i.e. broken)
upon removing the struct_mutex serialisation.
