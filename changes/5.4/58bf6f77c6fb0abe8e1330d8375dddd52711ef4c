rcu/nocb: Rename rcu_data fields to prepare for forward-progress work

This commit simply renames rcu_data fields to prepare for leader
nocb kthreads doing only grace-period work and callback shuffling.
This will mean the addition of replacement kthreads to invoke callbacks.
The "leader" and "follower" thus become less meaningful, so the commit
changes no-CB fields with these strings to "gp" and "cb", respectively.
