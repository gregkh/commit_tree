hwrng: core - Freeze khwrng thread during suspend

The hwrng_fill() function can run while devices are suspending and
resuming. If the hwrng is behind a bus such as i2c or SPI and that bus
is suspended, the hwrng may hang the bus while attempting to add some
randomness. It's been observed on ChromeOS devices with suspend-to-idle
(s2idle) and an i2c based hwrng that this kthread may run and ask the
hwrng device for randomness before the i2c bus has been resumed.

Let's make this kthread freezable so that we don't try to touch the
hwrng during suspend/resume. This ensures that we can't cause the hwrng
backing driver to get into a bad state because the device is guaranteed
to be resumed before the hwrng kthread is thawed.
