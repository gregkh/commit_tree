drm/i915: Support ro ppgtt mapped cmdparser shadow buffers

For Gen7, the original cmdparser motive was to permit limited
use of register read/write instructions in unprivileged BB's.
This worked by copying the user supplied bb to a kmd owned
bb, and running it in secure mode, from the ggtt, only if
the scanner finds no unsafe commands or registers.

For Gen8+ we can't use this same technique because running bb's
from the ggtt also disables access to ppgtt space. But we also
do not actually require 'secure' execution since we are only
trying to reduce the available command/register set. Instead we
will copy the user buffer to a kmd owned read-only bb in ppgtt,
and run in the usual non-secure mode.

Note that ro pages are only supported by ppgtt (not ggtt), but
luckily that's exactly what we need.

Add the required paths to map the shadow buffer to ppgtt ro for Gen8+
