powerpc/64s/exception: machine check move unrecoverable handling out of line

Similarly to the previous change, all callers of the unrecoverable
handler run relocated so can reach it with a direct branch. This makes
it easy to move out of line, which makes the "normal" path less
cluttered and easier to follow.

MSR[ME] manipulation still requires the rfi, so that is moved out of
line to its own function.
