firmware: dmi: Fix unlikely out-of-bounds read in save_mem_devices

Before reading the Extended Size field, we should ensure it fits in
the DMI record. There is already a record length check but it does
not cover that field.

It would take a seriously corrupted DMI table to hit that bug, so no
need to worry, but we should still fix it.
