genirq/affinity: Improve __irq_build_affinity_masks()

One invariant of __irq_build_affinity_masks() is that all CPUs in the
specified masks (cpu_mask AND node_to_cpumask for each node) should be
covered during the spread. Even though all requested vectors have been
reached, it's still required to spread vectors among remained CPUs. A
similar policy has been taken in case of 'numvecs <= nodes' already.

So remove the following check inside the loop:

	if (done >= numvecs)
		break;

Meantime assign at least 1 vector for remaining nodes if 'numvecs' vectors
have been handled already.

Also, if the specified cpumask for one numa node is empty, simply do not
spread vectors on this node.
