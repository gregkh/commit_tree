posix-cpu-timers: Sanitize bogus WARNONS

Warning when p == NULL and then proceeding and dereferencing p does not
make any sense as the kernel will crash with a NULL pointer dereference
right away.

Bailing out when p == NULL and returning an error code does not cure the
underlying problem which caused p to be NULL. Though it might allow to
do proper debugging.

Same applies to the clock id check in set_process_cpu_timer().

Clean them up and make them return without trying to do further damage.
