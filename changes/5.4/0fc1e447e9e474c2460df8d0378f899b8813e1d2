ALSA: hda - Expand pin_match function to match upcoming new tbls

With the existing pintbl, we already have many entries in it. it is
better to figure out a new way to reduce the size of the pintbl.

We plan to define a new tbl which will match more machines with a
single tbl, To do that, this function doesn't need to match all valid
pins between machine and tbl, it just needs to match all pins defined
in the tbl with the machine.

And the plan is to move some tbls from pin_fixup_tbl to
fallback_pin_fixup_tbl gradually.
