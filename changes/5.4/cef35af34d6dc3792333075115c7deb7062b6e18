net/mlx5e: Add mlx5e HV VHCA stats agent

HV VHCA stats agent is responsible on running a preiodic rx/tx
packets/bytes stats update. Currently the supported format is version
MLX5_HV_VHCA_STATS_VERSION. Block ID 1 is dedicated for statistics data
transfer from the VF to the PF.

The reporter fetch the statistics data from all opened channels, fill it
in a buffer and send it to mlx5_hv_vhca_write_agent.

As the stats layer should include some metadata per block (sequence and
offset), the HV VHCA layer shall modify the buffer before actually send it
over block 1.
