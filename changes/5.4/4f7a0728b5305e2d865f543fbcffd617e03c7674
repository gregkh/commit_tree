ASoC: fsl_sai: Add support for SAI new version

New IP version introduces Version ID and Parameter registers
and optionally added Timestamp feature.

VERID and PARAM registers are placed at the top of registers
address space and some registers are shifted according to
the following table:

Tx/Rx data registers and Tx/Rx FIFO registers keep their
addresses, all other registers are shifted by 8.

SAI Memory map is described in chapter 13.10.4.1.1 I2S Memory map
of the Reference Manual [1].

In order to make as less changes as possible we attach an offset
to each register offset to each changed register definition. The
offset is read from each board private data.
