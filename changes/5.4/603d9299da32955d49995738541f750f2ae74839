mfd: mt6397: Fix probe after changing mt6397-core

Part 3 from this series [1] was not merged due to wrong splitting
and breaks mt6323 pmic on bananapi-r2

dmesg prints this line and at least switch is not initialized on bananapi-r2

mt6397 1000d000.pwrap:mt6323: unsupported chip: 0x0

this patch contains only the probe-changes and chip_data structs
from original part 3 by Hsin-Hsiung Wang
