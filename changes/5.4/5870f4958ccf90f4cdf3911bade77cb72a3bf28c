watchdog: ziirave_wdt: Simplify ziirave_firm_write_pkt()

There no reason why ziirave_firm_write_pkt() has to take firmware
data via 'struct ihex_binrec' and it can just take address, data pointer
and data length as individual arguments. Make this change to allow us
to drastically simplify handling page crossing case by removing all of
the extra code required to split 'struct ihex_binrec' into two.
