crypto: gcm - restrict assoclen for rfc4543

Based on seqiv, IPsec ESP and rfc4543/rfc4106 the assoclen can be 16 or
20 bytes.

From esp4/esp6, assoclen is sizeof IP Header. This includes spi, seq_no
and extended seq_no, that is 8 or 12 bytes.
In seqiv, to asscolen is added the IV size (8 bytes).
Therefore, the assoclen, for rfc4543, should be restricted to 16 or 20
bytes, as for rfc4106.
