net: fix sk_page_frag() recursion from memory reclaim

sk_page_frag() optimizes skb_frag allocations by using per-task
skb_frag cache when it knows it's the only user.  The condition is
determined by seeing whether the socket allocation mask allows
blocking - if the allocation may block, it obviously owns the task's
context and ergo exclusively owns current->task_frag.

Unfortunately, this misses recursion through memory reclaim path.
Please take a look at the following backtrace.

In [0], tcp_send_msg_locked() was using current->page_frag when it
called sk_wmem_schedule().  It already calculated how many bytes can
be fit into current->page_frag.  Due to memory pressure,
sk_wmem_schedule() called into memory reclaim path which called into
xfs and then IO issue path.  Because the filesystem in question is
backed by nbd, the control goes back into the tcp layer - back into
tcp_sendmsg_locked().

nbd sets sk_allocation to (GFP_NOIO | __GFP_MEMALLOC) which makes
sense - it's in the process of freeing memory and wants to be able to,
e.g., drop clean pages to make forward progress.  However, this
confused sk_page_frag() called from [2].  Because it only tests
whether the allocation allows blocking which it does, it now thinks
current->page_frag can be used again although it already was being
used in [0].

After [2] used current->page_frag, the offset would be increased by
the used amount.  When the control returns to [0],
current->page_frag's offset is increased and the previously calculated
number of bytes now may overrun the end of allocated memory leading to
silent memory corruptions.

Fix it by adding gfpflags_normal_context() which tests sleepable &&
!reclaim and use it to determine whether to use current->task_frag.

v2: Eric didn't like gfp flags being tested twice.  Introduce a new
    helper gfpflags_normal_context() and combine the two tests.
