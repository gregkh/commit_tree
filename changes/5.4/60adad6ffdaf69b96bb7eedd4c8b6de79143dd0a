drm/amd/powerplay: fix message of SetHardMinByFreq failed when feature is disabled

the direct send message to smc to set hard clokc will failed
when smc clock dpm feature is disabled.
so use function of smu_set_hard_freq_range to replace it.
the function will check feature enablement.

eg: when uclk (mclk) dpm feature is disabled on navi10
