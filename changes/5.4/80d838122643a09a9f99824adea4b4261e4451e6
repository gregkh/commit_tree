arm64: prefer __section from compiler_attributes.h

GCC unescapes escaped string section names while Clang does not. Because
__section uses the `#` stringification operator for the section name, it
doesn't need to be escaped.

This antipattern was found with:
$ grep -e __section\(\" -e __section__\(\" -r
