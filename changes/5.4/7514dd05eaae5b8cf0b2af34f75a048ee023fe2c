PM / devfreq: tegra: Properly disable interrupts

There is no guarantee that interrupt handling isn't running in parallel
with tegra_actmon_disable_interrupts(), hence it is necessary to protect
DEV_CTRL register accesses and clear IRQ status with ACTMON's IRQ being
disabled in the Interrupt Controller in order to ensure that device
interrupt is indeed being disabled.
