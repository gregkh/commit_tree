IB/hfi1: Do not update hcrc for a KDETH packet during fault injection

When a KDETH packet is subject to fault injection during transmission,
HCRC is supposed to be omitted from the packet so that the hardware on the
receiver side would drop the packet. When creating pbc, the PbcInsertHcrc
field is set to be PBC_IHCRC_NONE if the KDETH packet is subject to fault
injection, but overwritten with PBC_IHCRC_LKDETH when update_hcrc() is
called later.

This problem is fixed by not calling update_hcrc() when the packet is
subject to fault injection.
