sctp: add chunks to sk_backlog when the newsk sk_socket is not set

This patch is to fix a NULL-ptr deref in selinux_socket_connect_helper:

  [...] RIP: 0010:selinux_socket_connect_helper+0x94/0x460

It was caused by that the 'newsk' sk_socket was not set before going to
security sctp hook when processing asconf chunk with SCTP_PARAM_ADD_IP
or SCTP_PARAM_SET_PRIMARY:

  inet_accept()->
    sctp_accept():
      lock_sock():
          lock listening 'sk'
                                          do_softirq():
                                            sctp_rcv():  <-- [1]
                                                asconf chunk arrives and
                                                enqueued in 'sk' backlog
      sctp_sock_migrate():
          set asoc's sk to 'newsk'
      release_sock():
          sctp_backlog_rcv():
            lock 'newsk'
            sctp_process_asconf()  <-- [2]
            unlock 'newsk'
    sock_graft():
        set sk_socket  <-- [3]

As it shows, at [1] the asconf chunk would be put into the listening 'sk'
backlog, as accept() was holding its sock lock. Then at [2] asconf would
get processed with 'newsk' as asoc's sk had been set to 'newsk'. However,
'newsk' sk_socket is not set until [3], while selinux_sctp_bind_connect()
would deref it, then kernel crashed.

Here to fix it by adding the chunk to sk_backlog until newsk sk_socket is
set when .accept() is done.

Note that sk->sk_socket can be NULL when the sock is closed, so SOCK_DEAD
flag is also needed to check in sctp_newsk_ready().

Thanks to Ondrej for reviewing the code.
