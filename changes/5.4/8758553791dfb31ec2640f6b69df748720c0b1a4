iommu/qcom: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct qcom_iommu_dev {
	...
        struct qcom_iommu_ctx   *ctxs[0];   /* indexed by asid-1 */
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*qcom_iommu) + (max_asid * sizeof(qcom_iommu->ctxs[0]))

with:

struct_size(qcom_iommu, ctxs, max_asid)

Also, notice that, in this case, variable sz is not necessary,
hence it is removed.

This code was detected with the help of Coccinelle.
