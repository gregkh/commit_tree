drm/amd/display: fix dcn-specific clk_mgr init_clocks

[Why]
underflow seen on certain monitor setups caused by making dcnxx_init_hw
generic

[How]
by moving dcn20_init_hw into dcn10, we added a dcn-specific clk_mgr
init (dc->clk_mgr->funcs->init_clocks()). Thus, put old clk_mgr
memset in an else statement so both memsets don't get set
