drm/amdgpu: cleanup vega10 SRIOV code path

we can simplify all those unnecessary function under
SRIOV for vega10 since:
1) PSP L1 policy is by force enabled in SRIOV
2) original logic always set all flags which make itself
   a dummy step

besides,
1) the ih_doorbell_range set should also be skipped
for VEGA10 SRIOV.
2) the gfx_common registers should also be skipped
for VEGA10 SRIOV.
