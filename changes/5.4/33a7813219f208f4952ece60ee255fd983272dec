USB: legousbtower: fix deadlock on disconnect

Fix a potential deadlock if disconnect races with open.

Since commit d4ead16f50f9 ("USB: prevent char device open/deregister
race") core holds an rw-semaphore while open is called and when
releasing the minor number during deregistration. This can lead to an
ABBA deadlock if a driver takes a lock in open which it also holds
during deregistration.

This effectively reverts commit 78663ecc344b ("USB: disconnect open race
in legousbtower") which needlessly introduced this issue after a generic
fix for this race had been added to core by commit d4ead16f50f9 ("USB:
prevent char device open/deregister race").
