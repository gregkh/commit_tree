platform/chrome: cros_ec_rpmsg: Fix race with host command when probe failed

Since the rpmsg_endpoint is created before probe is called, it's
possible that a host event is received during cros_ec_register, and
there would be some pending work in the host_event_work workqueue while
cros_ec_register is called.

If cros_ec_register fails, when the leftover work in host_event_work
run, the ec_dev from the drvdata of the rpdev could be already set to
NULL, causing kernel crash when trying to run cros_ec_get_next_event.

Fix this by creating the rpmsg_endpoint by ourself, and when
cros_ec_register fails (or on remove), destroy the endpoint first (to
make sure there's no more new calls to cros_ec_rpmsg_callback), and then
cancel all works in the host_event_work workqueue.
