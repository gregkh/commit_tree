hrtimer: Protect lockless access to timer->base

The update to timer->base is protected by the base->cpu_base->lock().
However, hrtimer_cancel_wait_running() does access it lockless.  So the
compiler is allowed to refetch timer->base which can cause havoc when the
timer base is changed concurrently.

Use READ_ONCE() to prevent this.
