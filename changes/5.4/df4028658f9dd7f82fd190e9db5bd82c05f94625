staging: Add VirtualBox guest shared folder (vboxsf) support

VirtualBox hosts can share folders with guests, this commit adds a
VFS driver implementing the Linux-guest side of this, allowing folders
exported by the host to be mounted under Linux.

This driver depends on the guest <-> host IPC functions exported by
the vboxguest driver.
