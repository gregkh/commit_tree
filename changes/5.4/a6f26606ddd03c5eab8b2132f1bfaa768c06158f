rtc: rv3029: revert error handling patch to rv3029_eeprom_write()

My error handling "cleanup" was totally wrong.  Both the "err" and "ret"
variables are required.  The "err" variable holds the error codes for
rv3029_eeprom_enter/exit() and the "ret" variable holds the error codes
for if actual write fails.  In my patch if the write failed, the
function probably still returned success.
