USB: iowarrior: drop redundant disconnect mutex

Drop the redundant disconnect mutex which was introduced after the
open-disconnect race had been addressed generally in USB core by commit
d4ead16f50f9 ("USB: prevent char device open/deregister race").

Specifically, the rw-semaphore in core guarantees that all calls to
open() will have completed and that no new calls to open() will occur
after usb_deregister_dev() returns. Hence there is no need use the
driver data as an inverted disconnected flag.
