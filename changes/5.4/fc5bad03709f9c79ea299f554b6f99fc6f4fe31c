ia64: remove the hpsim platform

The hpsim platform supports the HP IA64 simulator which was useful as a
bring up platform.  But it is fairly non-standard vs real IA64 system
in that it for example doesn't support ACPI.  It also comes with a
whole bunch of simulator specific drivers.  Remove it to simplify the
IA64 port.

Note that through a weird twist only them hpsim boot loader built the
vmlinux.gz file, so the makefile targets for that are moved to the
main ia64 Makefile now.
