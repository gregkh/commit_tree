modpost: add support for symbol namespaces

Add support for symbols that are exported into namespaces. For that,
extract any namespace suffix from the symbol name. In addition, emit a
warning whenever a module refers to an exported symbol without
explicitly importing the namespace that it is defined in. This patch
consistently adds the namespace suffix to symbol names exported into
Module.symvers.

Example warning emitted by modpost in case of the above violation:

 WARNING: module ums-usbat uses symbol usb_stor_resume from namespace
 USB_STORAGE, but does not import it.
