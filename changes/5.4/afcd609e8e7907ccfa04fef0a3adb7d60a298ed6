scsi: pm80xx: remove redundant assignments to variable rc

There are several occasions where variable rc is being initialized with a
value that is never read and error is being re-assigned a little later on.
Clean up the code by removing rc entirely and just returning the return
value from the call to pm8001_issue_ssp_tmf
