drm/i915/gvt: decouple check_vgpu() from uncore_init()

With multiple uncore to initialize (GT vs Display), it makes little
sense to have the vgpu_check inside uncore_init(). We also have
a catch-22 scenario where the uncore is required to read the vgpu
capabilities while the vgpu capabilities are required to decide if
we need to initialize forcewake support. To remove this circular
dependency, we can perform the required MMIO access by mmapping just
the vgtif shared page in mmio space and use raw accessors.

v2: rename check_vgpu to detect_vgpu (Chris)
