scsi: qla2xxx: cleanup trace buffer initialization

Avoid code duplication between qla2x00_alloc_offload_mem() and
qla2x00_alloc_fw_dump() by moving the FCE and EFT buffer allocation and
initialization to separate functions. Cleanly track failure and success by
making sure that the ha->eft, ha->fce and respective eft_dma, fce_dma
members are set if and only if the buffers are properly allocated and
initialized. Avoid pointless buffer reallocation.  Eliminate some goto
statements. Make sure the fce_enabled flag is cleared when the FCE buffer
is freed.
