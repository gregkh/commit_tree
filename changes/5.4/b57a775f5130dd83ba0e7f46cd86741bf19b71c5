mm: silence -Woverride-init/initializer-overrides

When compiling a kernel with W=1, there are several of those warnings due
to arm64 overriding a field on purpose.  Just disable those warnings for
both GCC and Clang of this file, so it will help dig "gems" hidden in the
W=1 warnings by reducing some noises.

mm/init-mm.c:39:2: warning: initializer overrides prior initialization
of this subobject [-Winitializer-overrides]
        INIT_MM_CONTEXT(init_mm)
        ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
./arch/arm64/include/asm/mmu.h:133:9: note: expanded from macro
'INIT_MM_CONTEXT'
        .pgd = init_pg_dir,
               ^~~~~~~~~~~
mm/init-mm.c:30:10: note: previous initialization is here
        .pgd            = swapper_pg_dir,
                          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: there is a side project trying to support explicitly allowing
specific initializer overrides in Clang, but there is no guarantee it
will happen or not.
