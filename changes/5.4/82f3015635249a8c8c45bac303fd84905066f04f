iio: light: opt3001: fix mutex unlock race

When an end-of-conversion interrupt is received after performing a
single-shot reading of the light sensor, the driver was waking up the
result ready queue before checking opt->ok_to_ignore_lock to determine
if it should unlock the mutex. The problem occurred in the case where
the other thread woke up and changed the value of opt->ok_to_ignore_lock
to false prior to the interrupt thread performing its read of the
variable. In this case, the mutex would be unlocked twice.
