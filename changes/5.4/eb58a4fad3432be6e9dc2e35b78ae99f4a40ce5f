video: sa1100fb: Remove cpufreq policy notifier

The cpufreq policy notifier's CPUFREQ_ADJUST notification is going to
get removed soon.

The notifier callback sa1100fb_freq_policy() isn't doing anything apart
from printing a debug message on CPUFREQ_ADJUST notification. There is
no point in keeping an otherwise empty callback and registering the
notifier.

Remove it.
