usb: dwc3: remove generic PHY calibrate() calls

Calls to USB2 generic PHY calibrate() method has been moved to HCD core,
which now successfully handles generic PHYs and their calibration after
every HCD reset. This fixes all the timing issues related to PHY
calibration done directly from DWC3 driver: incorrect operation after
system suspend/resume or USB3.0 detection failure when XHCI-plat driver
compiled as separate module.
