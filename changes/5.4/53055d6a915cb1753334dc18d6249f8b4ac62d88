staging: wlan-ng: Remove function hfa384x_docmd_wait()

As hfa384x_docmd is only called by hfa384x_docmd_wait, and
hfa384x_docmd_wait always passes 4 constant arguments (DOWAIT,
NULL, NULL, NULL) to hfa384x_docmd, these constant parameters may be
removed from hfa384x_docmd and their values used directly instead.
Remove check for one of these constant parameters of hfa384x_docmd as
it is no longer necessary.
Remove hfa384x_docmd_wait as it does nothing except call hfa384x_docmd.
Modify call sites of hfa384x_docmd_wait to call hfa384x_docmd instead.
Change type of hfa384x_docmd to inline to match type of former
hfa384x_docmd_wait.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
