ocfs2: further debugfs cleanups

There is no need to check return value of debugfs_create functions, but
the last sweep through ocfs missed a number of places where this was
happening.  There is also no need to save the individual dentries for the
debugfs files, as everything is can just be removed at once when the
directory is removed.

By getting rid of the file dentries for the debugfs entries, a bit of
local memory can be saved as well.
