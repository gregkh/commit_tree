f2fs: support FS_IOC_{GET,SET}FSLABEL

Support two generic fs ioctls FS_IOC_{GET,SET}FSLABEL, letting
f2fs pass generic/492 testcase.

Fixes were made by Eric where:
 - f2fs: fix buffer overruns in FS_IOC_{GET, SET}FSLABEL
   utf16s_to_utf8s() and utf8s_to_utf16s() take the number of characters,
   not the number of bytes.

 - f2fs: fix copying too many bytes in FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL
   Userspace provides a null-terminated string, so don't assume that the
   full FSLABEL_MAX bytes can always be copied.

 - f2fs: add missing authorization check in FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL
   FS_IOC_SETFSLABEL modifies the filesystem superblock, so it shouldn't be
   allowed to regular users.  Require CAP_SYS_ADMIN, like xfs and btrfs do.
