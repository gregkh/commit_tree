media: drivers/media: don't set pix->priv = 0

The priv field of struct v4l2_pix_format shouldn't be set by drivers,
it's set by the v4l2 core instead to V4L2_PIX_FMT_PRIV_MAGIC.

Drop this from the few media drivers that still do this.

Note that the gspca patch is slightly more involved since some of the
sub-gspca drivers use the priv field internally.
