xilinx_uartps.c: suppress "may be used uninitialised" warning

A powerpc allyesconfig build produces this warning:

It looks like gcc just can't track the relationship between "locked"
and "flags", and it is obvious that "flags" won't be used when "locked"
is zero, so the simplest thing is to initialise flags.
