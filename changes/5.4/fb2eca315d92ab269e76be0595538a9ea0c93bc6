ARM: 8872/1: Use common outgoing-CPU-notification code

This commit removes the open-coded CPU-offline notification with new
common code.  In particular, this change avoids calling scheduler code
using RCU from an offline CPU that RCU is ignoring.  This is a minimal
change.  A more intrusive change might invoke the cpu_check_up_prepare()
and cpu_set_state_online() functions at CPU-online time, which would
allow onlining throw an error if the CPU did not go offline properly.
