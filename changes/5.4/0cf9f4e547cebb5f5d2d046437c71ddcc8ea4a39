scsi: sd: define variable dif as unsigned int instead of bool

Variable dif in function sd_setup_read_write_cmnd() is the return value of
function scsi_host_dif_capable() which returns dif capability of disks.  If
define it as bool, even for the disks which support DIF3, the function
still return dif=1, which causes IO error. So define variable dif as
unsigned int instead of bool.
