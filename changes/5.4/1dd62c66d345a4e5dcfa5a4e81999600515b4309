PM / devfreq: events: extend events by type of counted data

This patch adds posibility to choose what type of data should be counted
by the PPMU counter. Now the type comes from DT where the event has been
defined. When there is no 'event-data-type' the default value is used,
which is 'read+write data in bytes'.
It is needed when you want to know not only read+write data bytes but
i.e. only write data in byte, or number of read requests, etc.
