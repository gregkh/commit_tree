module: support reading multiple values per modinfo tag

Similar to modpost's get_next_modinfo(), introduce get_next_modinfo() in
kernel/module.c to acquire any further values associated with the same
modinfo tag name. That is useful for any tags that have multiple
occurrences (such as 'alias'), but is in particular introduced here as
part of the symbol namespaces patch series to read the (potentially)
multiple namespaces a module is importing.
