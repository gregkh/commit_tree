KVM: x86: omit "impossible" pmu MSRs from MSR list

INTEL_PMC_MAX_GENERIC is currently 32, which exceeds the 18
contiguous MSR indices reserved by Intel for event selectors.
Since some machines actually have MSRs past the reserved range,
filtering them against x86_pmu.num_counters_gp may have false
positives.  Cut the list to 18 entries to avoid this.
