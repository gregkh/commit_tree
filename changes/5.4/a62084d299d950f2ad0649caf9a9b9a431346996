crypto: aead - Do not allow authsize=0 if auth. alg has digestsize>0

Return -EINVAL on an attempt to set the authsize to 0 with an auth.
algorithm with a non-zero digestsize (i.e. anything but digest_null)
as authenticating the data and then throwing away the result does not
make any sense at all.

The digestsize zero exception is for use with digest_null for testing
purposes only.
