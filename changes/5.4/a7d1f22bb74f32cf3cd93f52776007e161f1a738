mm: turn migrate_vma upside down

There isn't any good reason to pass callbacks to migrate_vma.  Instead
we can just export the three steps done by this function to drivers and
let them sequence the operation without callbacks.  This removes a lot
of boilerplate code as-is, and will allow the drivers to drastically
improve code flow and error handling further on.
