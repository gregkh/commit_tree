KVM: VMX: Add error handling to VMREAD helper

Now that VMREAD flows require a taken branch, courtesy of commit

  3901336ed9887 ("x86/kvm: Don't call kvm_spurious_fault() from .fixup")

bite the bullet and add full error handling to VMREAD, i.e. replace the
JMP added by __ex()/____kvm_handle_fault_on_reboot() with a hinted Jcc.

To minimize the code footprint, add a helper function, vmread_error(),
to handle both faults and failures so that the inline flow has a single
CALL.
