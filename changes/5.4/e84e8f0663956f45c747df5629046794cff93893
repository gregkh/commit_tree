block: add req op to reset all zones and flag

This patch introduces a new request operation REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET_ALL.
This is useful for the applications like mkfs where it needs to reset
all the zones present on the underlying block device. As part for this
patch we also introduce new QUEUE_FLAG_ZONE_RESETALL which indicates the
queue zone reset all capability and corresponding helper macro.
