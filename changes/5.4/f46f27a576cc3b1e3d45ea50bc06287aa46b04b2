arm64: Fix incorrect irqflag restore for priority masking for compat

Commit bd82d4bd2188 ("arm64: Fix incorrect irqflag restore for priority
masking") added a macro to the entry.S call paths that leave the
PSTATE.I bit set. This tells the pPNMI masking logic that interrupts
are masked by the CPU, not by the PMR. This value is read back by
local_daif_save().

Commit bd82d4bd2188 added this call to el0_svc, as el0_svc_handler
is called with interrupts masked. el0_svc_compat was missed, but should
be covered in the same way as both of these paths end up in
el0_svc_common(), which expects to unmask interrupts.
