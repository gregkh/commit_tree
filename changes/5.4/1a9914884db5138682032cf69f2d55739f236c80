tcp: batch calls to sk_flush_backlog()

Starting from commit d41a69f1d390 ("tcp: make tcp_sendmsg() aware of socket backlog")
loopback flows got hurt, because for each skb sent, the socket receives an
immediate ACK and sk_flush_backlog() causes extra work.

Intent was to not let the backlog grow too much, but we went a bit too far.

We can check the backlog every 16 skbs (about 1MB chunks)
to increase TCP over loopback performance by about 15 %

Note that the call to sk_flush_backlog() handles a single ACK,
thanks to coalescing done on backlog, but cleans the 16 skbs
found in rtx rb-tree.
