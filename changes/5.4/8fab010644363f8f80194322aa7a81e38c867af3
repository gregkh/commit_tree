fuse: delete dentry if timeout is zero

Don't hold onto dentry in lru list if need to re-lookup it anyway at next
access.  Only do this if explicitly enabled, otherwise it could result in
performance regression.

More advanced version of this patch would periodically flush out dentries
from the lru which have gone stale.
