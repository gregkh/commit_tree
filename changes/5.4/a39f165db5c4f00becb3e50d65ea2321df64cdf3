i40e: allow reset in recovery mode

Driver waits after issuing a reset. When a reset takes too long a driver
gives up. Implemented by invoking PF reset in a loop. After defined
number of unsuccessful PF reset trials it returns error.
Without this patch PF reset fails when NIC is in recovery mode.

So make i40e_set_mac_type() public. i40e driver requires i40e_set_mac_type()
to be public. It is required for recovery mode handling. Without this patch
recovery mode could not be detected in i40e_probe().
