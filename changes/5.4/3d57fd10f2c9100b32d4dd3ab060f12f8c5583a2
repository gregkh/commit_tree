ice: Report stats when VSI is down

There is currently a check in get_ndo_stats that
returns before updating stats if the VSI is down
or there are no Tx or Rx queues.  This causes the
netdev to report zero stats with the netdev is down.

Remove the check so that the behavior of reporting
stats is the same as it was in IXGBE.
