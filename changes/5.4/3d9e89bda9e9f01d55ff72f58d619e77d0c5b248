watchdog: aspeed: add support for dual boot

Set WDT_CLEAR_TIMEOUT_AND_BOOT_CODE_SELECTION into WDT_CLEAR_TIMEOUT_STATUS
to clear out boot code source and re-enable access to the primary SPI flash
chip while booted via wdt2 from the alternate chip.

AST2400 datasheet says:
"In the 2nd flash booting mode, all the address mapping to CS0# would be
re-directed to CS1#. And CS0# is not accessible under this mode. To access
CS0#, firmware should clear the 2nd boot mode register in the WDT2 status
register WDT30.bit[1]."
