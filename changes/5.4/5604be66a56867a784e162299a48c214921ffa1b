media: uapi: h264: Add the concept of decoding mode

Some stateless decoders don't support per-slice decoding granularity
(or at least not in a way that would make them efficient or easy to use).

Expose a menu to control the supported decoding modes. Drivers are
allowed to support only one decoding but they can support both too.

To fully specify the decoding operation, we need to introduce
a start_byte_offset, to indicate where slices start.
