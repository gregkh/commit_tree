drm/lima: Reduce the amount of logs on deferred probe

There is no point to print deferred probe (and its failures to get
resources) as an error.  For example getting a regulator causes three
unneeded error messages:

    lima 13000000.gpu: failed to get regulator: -517
    lima 13000000.gpu: regulator init fail -517
    lima 13000000.gpu: Fatal error during GPU init

Also do not print clock rates before the initialization finishes
because they will be duplicated after deferral.  Each probe step already
prints error so remove the final error message "Fatal error during GPU
init".

In case of multiple probe tries this would pollute the dmesg.
