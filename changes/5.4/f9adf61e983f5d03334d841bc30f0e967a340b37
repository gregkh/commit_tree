spi: sprd: adi: Change hwlock to be optional

Now Spreadtrum ADI controller supplies multiple master accessing channel
to support multiple subsystems accessing, instead of using a hardware
spinlock to synchronize between the multiple subsystems.

To keep backward compatibility, we should change the hardware spinlock
to be optional. Moreover change to use of_hwspin_lock_get_id() function
which return -ENOENT error number to indicate no hwlock support.
