drm/amd/display: Clean up dynamic metadata logic

 [Why]
Code to enable DCN20 dynamic metadata feature is duplicated in two places
and was added to DCE110 enable stream.

[How]
Create DCN20 specific enable stream function for clarity, and add a hardware
sequencer function to program dynamic metadata to avoid the duplicate
code.
