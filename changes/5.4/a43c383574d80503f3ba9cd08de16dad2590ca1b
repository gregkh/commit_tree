btrfs: add space reservation tracepoint for reserved bytes

I noticed when folding the trace_btrfs_space_reservation() tracepoint
into the btrfs_space_info_update_* helpers that we didn't emit a
tracepoint when doing btrfs_add_reserved_bytes().  I know this is
because we were swapping bytes_may_use for bytes_reserved, so in my mind
there was no reason to have the tracepoint there.  But now there is
because we always emit the unreserve for the bytes_may_use side, and
this would have broken if compression was on anyway.  Add a tracepoint
to cover the bytes_reserved counter so the math still comes out right.
