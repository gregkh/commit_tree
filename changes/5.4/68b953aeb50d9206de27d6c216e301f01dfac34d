ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fixup HDaudio topology name with DMIC number

The SOF project maintains 6 topologies for HDaudio (iDisp or
HDaudio+iDisp, no DMIC, 2 DMICs, 4 DMICs). The user is currently
required to manually rename the topology file used in
/lib/firmware/intel/sof-tplg. We can do better to avoid such
renames and use logic to select the relevant file.

The NHLT information can be used to figure out which topology file
should be used.

Alternatively, when NHLT is not present in ACPI tables or is possibly
incorrect, a module parameter can provide that information, e.g. on
Up^2 board with the test DMIC kit.

Tested on Up^2 board and Acer Swift-SF314-55
