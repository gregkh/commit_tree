btrfs: delayed-inode: Kill the BUG_ON() in btrfs_delete_delayed_dir_index()

There is one report of fuzzed image which leads to BUG_ON() in
btrfs_delete_delayed_dir_index().

Although that fuzzed image can already be addressed by enhanced
extent-tree error handler, it's still better to hunt down more BUG_ON().

This patch will hunt down two BUG_ON()s in
btrfs_delete_delayed_dir_index():
- One for error from btrfs_delayed_item_reserve_metadata()
  Instead of BUG_ON(), we output an error message and free the item.
  And return the error.
  All callers of this function handles the error by aborting current
  trasaction.

- One for possible EEXIST from __btrfs_add_delayed_deletion_item()
  That function can return -EEXIST.
  We already have a good enough error message for that, only need to
  clean up the reserved metadata space and allocated item.

To help above cleanup, also modifiy __btrfs_remove_delayed_item() called
in btrfs_release_delayed_item(), to skip unassociated item.
