drm/panel: simple: Use display_timing for AUO b101ean01

Convert the AUO b101ean01 from using a fixed mode to specifying a
display timing with min/typ/max values.

The AUO b101ean01's datasheet says:
* Vertical blanking min is 12
* Horizontal blanking min is 60
* Pixel clock is between 65.3 MHz and 75 MHz

The goal here is to be able to specify the proper timing in device
tree to use on rk3288-veyron-minnie to match what the downstream
kernel is using so that it can used the fixed PLL.

Changes in v4:
 - display_timing for AUO b101ean01 new for v4.
Changes in v6:
 - Rebased to drm-misc next
 - Added tags
