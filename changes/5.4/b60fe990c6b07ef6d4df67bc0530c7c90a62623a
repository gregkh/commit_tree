KVM: coalesced_mmio: add bounds checking

The first/last indexes are typically shared with a user app.
The app can change the 'last' index that the kernel uses
to store the next result.  This change sanity checks the index
before using it for writing to a potentially arbitrary address.

This fixes CVE-2019-14821.
