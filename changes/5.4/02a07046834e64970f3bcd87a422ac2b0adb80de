arcnet: provide a buffer big enough to actually receive packets

struct archdr is only big enough to hold the header of various types of
arcnet packets. So to provide enough space to hold the data read from
hardware provide a buffer large enough to hold a packet with maximal
size.

The problem was noticed by the stack protector which makes the kernel
oops.
