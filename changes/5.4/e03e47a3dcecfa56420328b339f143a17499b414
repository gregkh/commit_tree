nfp: flower: offload MPLS set action

Recent additions to the kernel include a TC action module to manipulate
MPLS headers on packets. Such actions are available to offload via the
flow_offload intermediate representation API.

Modify the NFP driver to allow the offload of MPLS set actions to
firmware. Set actions update the outermost MPLS header. The offload
includes a mask to specify which fields should be set.
