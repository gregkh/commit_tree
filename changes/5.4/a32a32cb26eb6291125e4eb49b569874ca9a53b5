samples/bpf: make xdp_fwd more practically usable via devmap lookup

This address the TODO in samples/bpf/xdp_fwd_kern.c, which points out
that the chosen egress index should be checked for existence in the
devmap. This can now be done via taking advantage of Toke's work in
commit 0cdbb4b09a06 ("devmap: Allow map lookups from eBPF").

This change makes xdp_fwd more practically usable, as this allows for
a mixed environment, where IP-forwarding fallback to network stack, if
the egress device isn't configured to use XDP.
