ipvlan: set hw_enc_features like macvlan

Allow encapsulated packets sent to tunnels layered over ipvlan to use
offloads rather than forcing SW fallbacks.

Since commit f21e5077010acda73a60 ("macvlan: add offload features for
encapsulation"), macvlan has set dev->hw_enc_features to include
everything in dev->features; do likewise in ipvlan.
