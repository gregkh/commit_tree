powerpc/64s/radix: Remove redundant pfn_pte bitop, add VM_BUG_ON

pfn_pte is never given a pte above the addressable physical memory
limit, so the masking is redundant. In case of a software bug, it
is not obviously better to silently truncate the pfn than to corrupt
the pte (either one will result in memory corruption or crashes),
so there is no reason to add this to the fast path.

Add VM_BUG_ON to catch cases where the pfn is invalid. These would
catch the create_section_mapping bug fixed by a previous commit.
