pinctrl: uniphier: Separate modem group from UART ctsrts group

It depends on the board implementation whether to have each pins of
CTS/RTS, and others for modem. So it is necessary to divide current
uart_ctsrts group into uart_ctsrts and uart_modem groups.

Since the number of implemented pins for modem differs depending
on SoC, each uart_modem group also has a different number of pins.
