selftests/bpf: abstract away test log output

This patch changes how test output is printed out. By default, if test
had no errors, the only output will be a single line with test number,
name, and verdict at the end, e.g.:

  #31 xdp:OK

If test had any errors, all log output captured during test execution
will be output after test completes.

It's possible to force output of log with `-v` (`--verbose`) option, in
which case output won't be buffered and will be output immediately.

To support this, individual tests are required to use helper methods for
logging: `test__printf()` and `test__vprintf()`.
