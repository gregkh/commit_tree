arm64: apply ARM64_ERRATUM_845719 workaround for Brahma-B53 core

The Broadcom Brahma-B53 core is susceptible to the issue described by
ARM64_ERRATUM_845719 so this commit enables the workaround to be applied
when executing on that core.

Since there are now multiple entries to match, we must convert the
existing ARM64_ERRATUM_845719 into an erratum list.
