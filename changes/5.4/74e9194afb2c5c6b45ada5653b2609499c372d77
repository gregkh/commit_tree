btrfs: Remove delalloc_end argument from extent_clear_unlock_delalloc

It was added in ba8b04c1d4ad ("btrfs: extend btrfs_set_extent_delalloc
and its friends to support in-band dedupe and subpage size patchset") as
a preparatory patch for in-band and subapge block size patchsets.
However neither of those are likely to be merged anytime soon and the
code has diverged significantly from the last public post of either
of those patchsets.

It's unlikely either of the patchests are going to use those preparatory
steps so just remove the variables. Since cow_file_range also took
delalloc_end to pass it to extent_clear_unlock_delalloc remove the
parameter from that function as well.
