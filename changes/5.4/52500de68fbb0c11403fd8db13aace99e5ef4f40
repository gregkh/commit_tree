drm/vmwgfx: Don't look at state->allow_modeset

That's purely for the uapi layer to implement the ALLOW_MODESET flag.

Drivers should instead look at the state, e.g. through
drm_atomic_crtc_needs_modeset(), which vmwgfx already does. Also remove
the confusing comment, since checking allow_modeset is at best a micro
optimization.

v2: Rebase
