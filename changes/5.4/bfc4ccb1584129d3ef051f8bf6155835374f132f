staging: erofs: avoid loop in submit chains

As reported by erofs-utils fuzzer, 2 conditions
can happen in corrupted images, which can cause
unexpected behaviors.
 - access the same pcluster one more time;
 - access the tail end pcluster again, e.g.
            _ access again (will trigger tail merging)
           |
     1 2 3 1 2             ->   1 2 3 1
     |_ tail end of the chain    \___/ (unexpected behavior)
Let's detect and avoid them now.
