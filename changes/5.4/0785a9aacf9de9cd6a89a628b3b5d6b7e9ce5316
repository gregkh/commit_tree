btrfs: tree-checker: Add EXTENT_DATA_REF check

EXTENT_DATA_REF is a little like DIR_ITEM which contains hash in its
key->offset.

This patch will check the following contents:
- Key->objectid
  Basic alignment check.

- Hash
  Hash of each extent_data_ref item must match key->offset.

- Offset
  Basic alignment check.
