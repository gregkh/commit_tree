drm/amd/display: Skip determining update type for async updates

[Why]
By passing through the dm_determine_update_type_for_commit for atomic
commits that can be done asynchronously we are incurring a
performance penalty by locking access to the global private object
and holding that access until the end of the programming sequence.

This is also allocating a new large dc_state on every access in addition
to retaining all the references on each stream and plane until the end
of the programming sequence.

[How]
Shift the determination for async update before validation. Return early
if it's going to be an async update.
