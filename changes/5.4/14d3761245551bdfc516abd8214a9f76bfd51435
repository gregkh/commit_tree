percpu: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct pcpu_alloc_info {
	...
        struct pcpu_group_info  groups[];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(*ai) + nr_groups * sizeof(ai->groups[0])

with:

struct_size(ai, groups, nr_groups)
