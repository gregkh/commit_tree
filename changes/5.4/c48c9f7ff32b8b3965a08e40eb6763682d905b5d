staging: exfat: add exfat filesystem code to staging

The exfat code needs a lot of work to get it into "real" shape for
the fs/ part of the kernel, so put it into drivers/staging/ for now so
that it can be worked on by everyone in the community.

The full specification of the filesystem can be found at:
