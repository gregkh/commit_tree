arm64: cpufeature: Enable Qualcomm Falkor/Kryo errata 1003

With the introduction of 'cce360b54ce6 ("arm64: capabilities: Filter the
entries based on a given mask")' the Qualcomm Falkor/Kryo errata 1003 is
no long applied.

The result of not applying errata 1003 is that MSM8996 runs into various
RCU stalls and fails to boot most of the times.

Give 1003 a "type" to ensure they are not filtered out in
update_cpu_capabilities().
