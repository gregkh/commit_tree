media: staging: davinci: remove vpfe driver

The davinci_vpfe driver was merged into staging back in 2012 by Manjunath
Hadli from TI, with a long TODO list.

For all I can tell, since then it has only seen fixes for compile-time
issues and global cleanups, but nobody has actually worked on the items
on the TODO list.

To make things worse, the driver in its current form is incompatible with
the platform code in arch/arm/mach-davinci, i.e. the driver expects to
get its platform_data passed to the device as a 'struct vpfe_config',
but uses a differnet definition for that structure compared to what the
platform uses.

Finally, there is another driver for the same device in
drivers/media/platform/davinci/vpfe_capture.c. From all I can tell, the
staging version was originally a copy of a more featureful driver in TI's
downstream kernels. However, that kernel no longer supports dm365 after
linux-2.6.37, and the mainline version moved in a different direction.
