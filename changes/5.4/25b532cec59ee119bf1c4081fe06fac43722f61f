docs: fs: convert porting to ReST

This file has its own proper style, except that, after a while,
the coding style gets violated and whitespaces are placed on
different ways.

As Sphinx and ReST are very sentitive to whitespace differences,
I had to opt if each entry after required/mandatory/... fields
should start with zero spaces or with a tab. I opted to start them
all from the zero position, in order to avoid needing to break lines
with more than 80 columns, with would make harder for review.

Most of the other changes at porting.rst were made to use an unified
notation with works nice as a text file while also produce a good html
output after being parsed.
