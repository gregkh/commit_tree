null_blk: create a helper for zoned devices

This patch creates a helper function for handling zoned block device
operations.

This patch also restructured the code for null_blk_zoned.c and uses the
pattern to return blk_status_t and catch the error in the function
null_handle_cmd() into cmd->error variable instead of setting it up in
the deeper layer just like the way it is done for flush, badblocks and
memory backed case in the null_handle_cmd(). We also move
null_handle_zoned() to the null_blk_zoned.c to keep the zoned code
separate.
