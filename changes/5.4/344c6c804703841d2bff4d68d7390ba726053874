KVM/Hyper-V: Add new KVM capability KVM_CAP_HYPERV_DIRECT_TLBFLUSH

Hyper-V direct tlb flush function should be enabled for
guest that only uses Hyper-V hypercall. User space
hypervisor(e.g, Qemu) can disable KVM identification in
CPUID and just exposes Hyper-V identification to make
sure the precondition. Add new KVM capability KVM_CAP_
HYPERV_DIRECT_TLBFLUSH for user space to enable Hyper-V
direct tlb function and this function is default to be
disabled in KVM.
