KVM: LAPIC: Micro optimize IPI latency

This patch optimizes the virtual IPI emulation sequence:

write ICR2                     write ICR2
write ICR                      read ICR2
read ICR            ==>        send virtual IPI
read ICR2                      write ICR
send virtual IPI

It can reduce kvm-unit-tests/vmexit.flat IPI testing latency(from sender
send IPI to sender receive the ACK) from 3319 cycles to 3203 cycles on
SKylake server.
