media: v4l2-dev/ioctl: require non-zero device_caps, verify sane querycap results

Now that all V4L2 drivers set device_caps in struct video_device, we can add
a check for this to ensure all future drivers fill this in.

Also verify that when the querycap ioctl is called the driver didn't mess
with the device_caps value and that capabilities is a superset of device_caps.
