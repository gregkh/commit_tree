can: mcp251x: Use devm_clk_get_optional() to get the input clock

Simplify the code which fetches the input clock by using
devm_clk_get_optional(). This comes with a small functional change: previously
all errors were ignored when platform data is present. Now all errors are
treated as errors. If no input clock is present devm_clk_get_optional() will
return NULL instead of an error which matches the behavior of the old code.
