scsi: lpfc: Add NVMe sequence level error recovery support

FC-NVMe-2 added support for sequence level error recovery in the FC-NVME
protocol. This allows for the detection of errors and lost frames and
immediate retransmission of data to avoid exchange termination, which
escalates into NVMeoFC connection and association failures. A significant
RAS improvement.

The driver is modified to indicate support for SLER in the NVMe PRLI is
issues and to check for support in the PRLI response.  When both sides
support it, the driver will set a bit in the WQE to enable the recovery
behavior on the exchange. The adapter will take care of all detection and
retransmission.
