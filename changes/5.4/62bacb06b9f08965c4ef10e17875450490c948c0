PM / devfreq: tegra: Fix kHz to Hz conversion

The kHz to Hz is incorrectly converted in a few places in the code,
this results in a wrong frequency being calculated because devfreq core
uses OPP frequencies that are given in Hz to clamp the rate, while
tegra-devfreq gives to the core value in kHz and then it also expects to
receive value in kHz from the core. In a result memory freq is always set
to a value which is close to ULONG_MAX because of the bug. Hence the EMC
frequency is always capped to the maximum and the driver doesn't do
anything useful. This patch was tested on Tegra30 and Tegra124 SoC's, EMC
frequency scaling works properly now.
