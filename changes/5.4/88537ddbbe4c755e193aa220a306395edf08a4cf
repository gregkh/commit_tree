drm/mcde: Fix DSI transfers

There were bugs in the DSI transfer (read and write) function
as it was only tested with displays ever needing a single byte
to be written. Fixed it up and tested so we can now write
messages of up to 16 bytes and read up to 4 bytes from the
display.

Tested with a Sony ACX424AKP display: this display now self-
identifies and can control backlight in command mode.
