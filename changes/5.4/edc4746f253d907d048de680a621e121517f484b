USB: iowarrior: fix use-after-free on disconnect

A recent fix addressing a deadlock on disconnect introduced a new bug
by moving the present flag out of the critical section protected by the
driver-data mutex. This could lead to a racing release() freeing the
driver data before disconnect() is done with it.

Due to insufficient locking a related use-after-free could be triggered
also before the above mentioned commit. Specifically, the driver needs
to hold the driver-data mutex also while checking the opened flag at
disconnect().
