net: hns3: add handshake with VF for PF reset

Before PF asserting function reset, it should make sure
that all its VFs have been ready, otherwise, it will cause
some hardware errors.

So this patch adds function hclge_func_reset_sync_vf() to
synchronize VF before asserting PF function reset. For new
firmware which supports command HCLGE_OPC_QUERY_VF_RST_RDY,
we will try to query VFs' ready status within 30 seconds.
And keep the old implementation for compatible with firmware
which does not support this command.
