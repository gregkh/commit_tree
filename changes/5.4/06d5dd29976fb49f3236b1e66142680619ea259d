spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Change usage pattern of SPI_MCR_* and SPI_CTAR_* macros

These are macros that accept 0 or 1 as argument (a boolean value). Their
use encourages the abuse of complex ternary operations inside their
argument list, which detracts from the code readability. Replace these
with simple if-else statements.
