usb: common: add USB GPIO based connection detection driver

Due to the requirement of usb-connector.txt binding, the old way
using extcon to support USB Dual-Role switch is now deprecated
when use Type-B connector.
This patch introduces a USB GPIO based connection detection driver,
used to support Type-B connector which typically uses an input GPIO
to detect USB ID pin, and try to replace the function provided
by the extcon-usb-gpio driver
