drop_monitor: Initialize timer and work item upon tracing enable

The timer and work item are currently initialized once during module
init, but subsequent patches will need to associate different functions
with the work item, based on the configured alert mode.

Allow subsequent patches to make that change by initializing and
de-initializing these objects during tracing enable and disable.

This also guarantees that once the request to disable tracing returns,
no more netlink notifications will be generated.
