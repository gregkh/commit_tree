crypto: arm64/aes-ce - switch to library version of key expansion routine

Switch to the new AES library that also provides an implementation of
the AES key expansion routine. This removes the dependency on the
generic AES cipher, allowing it to be omitted entirely in the future.

While at it, remove some references to the table based arm64 version
of AES and replace them with AES library calls as well.
