drm/amd/display: Fix some HUBP programming issues

[Why]
A hubp pointer was being passed to DCN1 functions, which
expect the enclosing structure (for the purpose of container_of macros)
to be dcn10_hubp, but the actual type was dcn20_hubp.

[How]
Copy existing DCN1 functions and alter them slightly for use with
dcn20_hubp.
