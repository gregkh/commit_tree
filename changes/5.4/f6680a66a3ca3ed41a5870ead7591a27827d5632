Revert "of/platform: Fix fn definitons for of_link_is_valid() and of_link_property()"

This reverts commit 0ad0bdd8ba6489d05044aa5ca6c6f7491be7743c.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
