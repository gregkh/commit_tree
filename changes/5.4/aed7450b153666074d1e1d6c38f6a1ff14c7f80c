drm/i915: Add HDCP capability info to i915_display_info.

To identify the HDCP capability of the display connected to CI
systems, we need to add the hdcp capability probing in i915_display_info.

This will also help to populate the HDCP capability of the CI systems
to CI H/W logs maintained at https://intel-gfx-ci.01.org/hardware/.
It will facilitate to determine the kms_content_protection behavior on
a particular CI system.

v2: Reused the intel_hdcp_info() in i915_hdcp_sink_capability_show(). [Ram]
    Shifted intel_hdcp_info() to the end of intel_dp_info. [Ram]
v3: used seq_puts() instead of seq_pritnf(). [Ram]
