KVM: arm64: pmu: Set the CHAINED attribute before creating the in-kernel event

The current convention for KVM to request a chained event from the
host PMU is to set bit[0] in attr.config1 (PERF_ATTR_CFG1_KVM_PMU_CHAINED).

But as it turns out, this bit gets set *after* we create the kernel
event that backs our virtual counter, meaning that we never get
a 64bit counter.

Moving the setting to an earlier point solves the problem.
