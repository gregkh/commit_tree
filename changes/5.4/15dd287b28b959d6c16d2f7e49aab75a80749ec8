tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: Fix issue in software flow control

Although I haven't observed this bug in practice, it seems that the
code for handling x_char of LPUART is pretty much identical to that of
i.MX. So the fix found in commit 7e2fb5aa8d81 ("serial: imx: Fix issue
in software flow control"):

    serial: imx: Fix issue in software flow control

    After send out x_char in UART driver, x_char needs to be cleared
    by UART driver itself, otherwise data in TXFIFO can no longer be
    sent out.
    Also tx counter needs to be increased to keep track of correct
    number of transmitted data.
