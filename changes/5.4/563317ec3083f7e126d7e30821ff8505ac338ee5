smb3: enable offload of decryption of large reads via mount option

Disable offload of the decryption of encrypted read responses
by default (equivalent to setting this new mount option "esize=0").

Allow setting the minimum encrypted read response size that we
will choose to offload to a worker thread - it is now configurable
via on a new mount option "esize="

Depending on which encryption mechanism (GCM vs. CCM) and
the number of reads that will be issued in parallel and the
performance of the network and CPU on the client, it may make
sense to enable this since it can provide substantial benefit when
multiple large reads are in flight at the same time.
