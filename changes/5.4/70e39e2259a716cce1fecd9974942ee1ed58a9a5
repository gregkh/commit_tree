crypto: inside-secure - Remove redundant algo to engine mapping code

This removes some code determine which engine has which algorithms which
was effectively redundant (may have been forward-looking?) due to always
enabling all algorithms for all currently supported engines.
A future patch will use a different, more scalable approach to achieve
this. This is removed now because otherwise the next patch will add new
hardware which would otherwise have to be added to all algorithms, so
now is a convenient time to just get rid of this.
