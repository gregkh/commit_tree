fuse: don't advise readdirplus for negative lookup

If the FUSE_READDIRPLUS_AUTO feature is enabled, then lookups on a
directory before/during readdir are used as an indication that READDIRPLUS
should be used instead of READDIR.  However if the lookup turns out to be
negative, then selecting READDIRPLUS makes no sense.
