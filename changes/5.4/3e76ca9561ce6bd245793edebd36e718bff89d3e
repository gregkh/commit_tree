scsi: csiostor: Prefer pcie_capability_read_word()

Commit 8c0d3a02c130 ("PCI: Add accessors for PCI Express Capability") added
accessors for the PCI Express Capability so that drivers didn't need to be
aware of differences between v1 and v2 of the PCI Express Capability.

Replace pci_read_config_word() and pci_write_config_word() calls with
pcie_capability_read_word() and pcie_capability_write_word().
