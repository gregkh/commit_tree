perf config: Honour $PERF_CONFIG env var to specify alternate .perfconfig

We had this comment in Documentation/perf_counter/config.c, i.e. since
when we got this from the git sources, but never really did that
getenv("PERF_CONFIG"), do it now as I need to disable whatever
~/.perfconfig root has so that tests parsing tool output are done for
the expected default output or that we specify an alternate config file
that when read will make the tools produce expected output.
