ceph: take the inode lock before acquiring cap refs

Most of the time, we (or the vfs layer) takes the inode_lock and then
acquires caps, but ceph_read_iter does the opposite, and that can lead
to a deadlock.

When there are multiple clients treading over the same data, we can end
up in a situation where a reader takes caps and then tries to acquire
the inode_lock. Another task holds the inode_lock and issues a request
to the MDS which needs to revoke the caps, but that can't happen until
the inode_lock is unwedged.

Fix this by having ceph_read_iter take the inode_lock earlier, before
attempting to acquire caps.
