Revert "driver core: Add edit_links() callback for drivers"

This reverts commit 134b23eec9e3a3c795a6ceb0efe2fa63e87983b2.

Based on a lot of email and in-person discussions, this patch series is
being reworked to address a number of issues that were pointed out that
needed to be taken care of before it should be merged.  It will be
resubmitted with those changes hopefully soon.
