um: Enable CONFIG_CONSTRUCTORS

We do need to call the constructors for *modules*, and
at least for KASAN in the future, we must call even the
kernel constructors only later when the kernel has been
initialized.

Instead of relying on libc to call them, emit an empty
section for libc and let the kernel's CONSTRUCTORS code
do the rest of the job.

Tested that it indeed doesn't work in modules, and does
work after the fixes in both, with a few functions with
__attribute__((constructor)) in both dynamic and static
builds.
