soundwire: stream: fix disable sequence

When we disable the stream and then call hw_free, two bank switches
will be handled and as a result we re-enable the stream on hw_free.

Make sure the stream is disabled on both banks.

TODO: we need to completely revisit all this and make sure we have a
mirroring mechanism between current and alternate banks.
