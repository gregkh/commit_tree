tick: Mark tick related hrtimers to expiry in hard interrupt context

The tick related hrtimers, which drive the scheduler tick and hrtimer based
broadcasting are required to expire in hard interrupt context for obvious
reasons.

Mark them so PREEMPT_RT kernels wont move them to soft interrupt expiry.

Make the horribly formatted RCU_NONIDLE bracket maze readable while at it.

No functional change,
