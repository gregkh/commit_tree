cpuidle-haltpoll: Enable kvm guest polling when dedicated physical CPUs are available

The downside of guest side polling is that polling is performed even
with other runnable tasks in the host. However, even if poll in kvm
can aware whether or not other runnable tasks in the same pCPU, it
can still incur extra overhead in over-subscribe scenario. Now we can
just enable guest polling when dedicated pCPUs are available.
