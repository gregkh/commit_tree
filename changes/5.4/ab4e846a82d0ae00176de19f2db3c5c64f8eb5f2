tcp: annotate sk->sk_wmem_queued lockless reads

For the sake of tcp_poll(), there are few places where we fetch
sk->sk_wmem_queued while this field can change from IRQ or other cpu.

We need to add READ_ONCE() annotations, and also make sure write
sides use corresponding WRITE_ONCE() to avoid store-tearing.

sk_wmem_queued_add() helper is added so that we can in
the future convert to ADD_ONCE() or equivalent if/when
available.
