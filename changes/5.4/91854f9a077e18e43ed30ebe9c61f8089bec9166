perf tools: Move everything related to sys_perf_event_open() to perf-sys.h

And remove unneeded include directives from perf-sys.h to prune the
header dependency tree.

Fixup the fallout in places where definitions were being used without
the needed include directives that were being satisfied because they
were in perf-sys.h.
