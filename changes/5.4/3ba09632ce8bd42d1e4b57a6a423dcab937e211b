drm/i915/buddy: use kmemleak_update_trace

Since nodes are cached in a free-list, and potentially marked as free
without actually being destroyed, thus allowing them to be
opportunistically re-allocated, we should apply kmemleak_update_trace
every time a node is given a new owner and marked as allocated, to aid
in debugging.
