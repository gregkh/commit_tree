net/smc: fix fastopen for non-blocking connect()

FASTOPEN does not work with SMC-sockets. Since SMC allows fallback to
TCP native during connection start, the FASTOPEN setsockopts trigger
this fallback, if the SMC-socket is still in state SMC_INIT.
But if a FASTOPEN setsockopt is called after a non-blocking connect(),
this is broken, and fallback does not make sense.
This change complements
commit cd2063604ea6 ("net/smc: avoid fallback in case of non-blocking connect")
and fixes the syzbot reported problem "WARNING in smc_unhash_sk".
