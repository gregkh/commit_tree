perf trace beauty: Disable fd->pathname when close() not enabled

As we invalidate the fd->pathname table in the SCA_CLOSE_FD beautifier,
if we don't have it we may end up keeping an fd->pathname association
that then gets misprinted.

The previous behaviour continues when the close() syscall is enabled,
which may still be a a problem if we lose records (i.e. we may lose a
'close' record and then get that fd reused by socket()) but then the
tool will notify that records are being lost and the user will be warned
that some of the heuristics will fall apart.
