dt-bindings: media: amlogic,vdec: add default compatible

The first version of the bindings is missing a generic compatible that
is used by the base node (GX), and then extended by the SoC device trees
(GXBB, GXL, GXM)

Also change the example to use "video-codec" instead of "video-decoder",
as the former is the one used in almost all cases when it comes to video
decode/encode accelerators.
