ASoC: SOF/Intel: fix selection of SND_INTEL_NHTL

We should only select SND_INTEL_NHLT when ACPI is defined. This was
done for the legacy HDAudio driver but not for DSP-enabled cases,
leading to compilation errors with randconfig.

Fix by aligning on the same solution.

For the Skylake driver this is overkill since there is a top-level
dependency on ACPI, but it doesn't hurt and it's better to have
consistency.
