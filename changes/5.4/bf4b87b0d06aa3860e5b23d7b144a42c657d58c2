pinctrl: freescale: imx: Add of_node_put() before return

Each iteration of for_each_child_of_node() puts the previous node;
however, in the case of a return from the middle of the loop, there is no
put, thus causing a memory leak. Hence put of_node_put() statements as
required before two mid-loop return statements.
Issue found with Coccinelle.
