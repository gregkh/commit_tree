powerpc/nvdimm: use H_SCM_QUERY hcall on H_OVERLAP error

Right now we force an unbind of SCM memory at drcindex on H_OVERLAP error.
This really slows down operations like kexec where we get the H_OVERLAP
error because we don't go through a full hypervisor re init.

H_OVERLAP error for a H_SCM_BIND_MEM hcall indicates that SCM memory at
drc index is already bound. Since we don't specify a logical memory
address for bind hcall, we can use the H_SCM_QUERY hcall to query
the already bound logical address.

Boot time difference with and without patch is:
