MIPS: Add partial 32-bit huge page support

 This adds initial support for huge pages to 32-bit MIPS systems.
Systems with extended addressing enabled (EVA,XPA,Alchemy/Netlogic)
are not yet supported.
 With huge pages enabled, this implementation will increase page table
memory overhead to match that of a 64-bit MIPS system. However, the
cache-friendliness of page table walks is not affected significantly.
