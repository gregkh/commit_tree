hrtimer: Introduce HARD expiry mode

On PREEMPT_RT not all hrtimers can be expired in hard interrupt context
even if that is perfectly fine on a PREEMPT_RT=n kernel, e.g. because they
take regular spinlocks. Also for latency reasons PREEMPT_RT tries to defer
most hrtimers' expiry into soft interrupt context.

But there are hrtimers which must be expired in hard interrupt context even
when PREEMPT_RT is enabled:

  - hrtimers which must expiry in hard interrupt context, e.g. scheduler,
    perf, watchdog related hrtimers

  - latency critical hrtimers, e.g. nanosleep, ..., kvm lapic timer

Add a new mode flag HRTIMER_MODE_HARD which allows to mark these timers so
PREEMPT_RT will not move them into softirq expiry mode.
