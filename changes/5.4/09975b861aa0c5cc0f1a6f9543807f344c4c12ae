drm/i915/execlists: Disable preemption under GVT

Preempt-to-busy uses a GPU semaphore to enforce an idle-barrier across
preemption, but mediated gvt does not fully support semaphores.

v2: Fiddle around with the flags and settle on using has-semaphores for
the core bits so that we retain the ability to preempt our own
semaphores.
