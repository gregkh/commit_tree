cfg80211: always shut down on HW rfkill

When the RFKILL subsystem isn't available, then rfkill_blocked()
always returns false. In the case of hardware rfkill this will
be wrong though, as if the hardware reported being killed then
it cannot operate any longer.

Since we only ever call the rfkill_sync work in this case, just
rename it to rfkill_block and always pass "true" for the blocked
parameter, rather than passing rfkill_blocked().

We rely on the underlying driver to still reject any new attempt
to bring up the device by itself.
