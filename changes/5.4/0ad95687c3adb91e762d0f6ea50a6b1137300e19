xfs: add kmem allocation trace points

When trying to correlate XFS kernel allocations to memory reclaim
behaviour, it is useful to know what allocations XFS is actually
attempting. This information is not directly available from
tracepoints in the generic memory allocation and reclaim
tracepoints, so these new trace points provide a high level
indication of what the XFS memory demand actually is.

There is no per-filesystem context in this code, so we just trace
the type of allocation, the size and the allocation constraints.
The kmem code also doesn't include much of the common XFS headers,
so there are a few definitions that need to be added to the trace
headers and a couple of types that need to be made common to avoid
needing to include the whole world in the kmem code.
