ASoC: soc-core: support snd_soc_dai_link_component for aux_dev

To find aux_dev, ASoC is using .name, codec_name, codec_of_node.
Here, .name is used to fallback in case of no codec.

But, we already have this kind of component finding method by
snd_soc_dai_link_component and soc_find_component().
We shouldn't have duplicated implementation to do same things.
This patch adds snd_soc_dai_link_component support to finding aux_dev.

Now, no driver is using only .name.
All drivers are using codec_name and/or codec_of_node.
This means no driver is finding component from .name so far.
(Actually almost all drivers are using .name as just "device name",
 not for finding component...)

This patch
1) add snd_soc_dai_link_component support for aux_dev. legacy style will
   be removed if all drivers are switched to new style.
2) try to find component via snd_soc_dai_link_component.
   Then, it doesn't try to find via .name, because no driver is using
   it so far.
