btrfs: fix balance convert to single on 32-bit host CPUs

Currently, the command:

	btrfs balance start -dconvert=single,soft .

on a Raspberry Pi produces the following kernel message:

	BTRFS error (device mmcblk0p2): balance: invalid convert data profile single

This fails because we use is_power_of_2(unsigned long) to validate
the new data profile, the constant for 'single' profile uses bit 48,
and there are only 32 bits in a long on ARM.

Fix by open-coding the check using u64 variables.

Tested by completing the original balance command on several Raspberry
Pis.
