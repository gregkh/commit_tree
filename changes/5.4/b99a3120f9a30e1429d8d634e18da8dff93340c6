rtc: meson: mark PM functions as __maybe_unused

The meson_vrtc_set_wakeup_time() function is only used by
the PM functions and causes a warning when they are disabled:

drivers/rtc/rtc-meson-vrtc.c:32:13: error: unused function 'meson_vrtc_set_wakeup_time' [-Werror,-Wunused-function]

Remove the #ifdef around the callers and add a __maybe_unused
annotation as a more reliable way to avoid these warnings.
