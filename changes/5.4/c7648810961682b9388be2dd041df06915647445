ice: Implement Dynamic Device Personalization (DDP) download

Add the required defines, structures, and functions to enable downloading
a DDP package.  Before download, checks are performed to ensure the package
is valid and compatible.

Note that package download is not yet requested by the driver as further
initialization is required to utilize the package.
