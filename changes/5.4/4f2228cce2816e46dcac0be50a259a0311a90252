dmaengine: bcm2835: Allow cyclic transactions without interrupt

The BCM2835 DMA driver currently requests an interrupt from the
controller regardless whether or not the client has passed in the
DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT flag. This causes unnecessary overhead for cyclic
transactions which do not need an interrupt after each period.

We're about to add such a use case, namely cyclic clearing of the SPI
controller's RX FIFO, so amend the DMA driver to request an interrupt
only if DMA_PREP_INTERRUPT was passed in. Ignore the period_len for
such transactions and set it to the buffer length to make the driver's
calculations work.
