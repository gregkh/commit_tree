xfs: factor callbacks out of xlog_state_do_callback()

Simplify the code flow by lifting the iclog callback work out of
the main iclog iteration loop. This isolates the log juggling and
callbacks from the iclog state change logic in the loop.

Note that the loopdidcallbacks variable is not actually tracking
whether callbacks are actually run - it is tracking whether the
icloglock was dropped during the loop and so determines if we
completed the entire iclog scan loop atomically. Hence we know for
certain there are either no more ordered completions to run or
that the next completion will run the remaining ordered iclog
completions. Hence rename that variable appropriately for it's
function.
