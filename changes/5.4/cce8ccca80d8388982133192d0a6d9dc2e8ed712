media: use the BIT() macro

As warned by cppcheck:

	[drivers/media/dvb-frontends/cx24123.c:434]: (error) Shifting signed 32-bit value by 31 bits is undefined behaviour
	[drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/bttv-input.c:87]: (error) Shifting signed 32-bit value by 31 bits is undefined behaviour
	[drivers/media/pci/bt8xx/bttv-input.c:98]: (error) Shifting signed 32-bit value by 31 bits is undefined behaviour
			...
	[drivers/media/v4l2-core/v4l2-ioctl.c:1391]: (error) Shifting signed 32-bit value by 31 bits is undefined behaviour

There are lots of places where we're doing 1 << 31. That's bad,
as, depending on the architecture, this has an undefined behavior.

The BIT() macro is already prepared to handle this, so, let's
just switch all "1 << number" macros by BIT(number) at the header files
with has 1 << 31.
