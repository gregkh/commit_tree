iommu/mediatek: Move reset_axi into plat_data

In mt8173 and mt8183, 0x48 is REG_MMU_STANDARD_AXI_MODE while it is
REG_MMU_CTRL in the other SoCs, and the bits meaning is completely
different with the REG_MMU_STANDARD_AXI_MODE.

This patch moves this property to plat_data, it's also a preparing
patch for mt8183.
