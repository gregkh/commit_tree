samples/bpf: add use of need_wakeup flag in xdpsock

This commit adds using the need_wakeup flag to the xdpsock sample
application. It is turned on by default as we think it is a feature
that seems to always produce a performance benefit, if the application
has been written taking advantage of it. It can be turned off in the
sample app by using the '-m' command line option.

The txpush and l2fwd sub applications have also been updated to
support poll() with multiple sockets.
