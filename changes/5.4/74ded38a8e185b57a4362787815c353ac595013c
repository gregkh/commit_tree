w1: add 1-wire master driver for IP block found in SGI ASICs

Starting with SGI Origin machines nearly every new SGI ASIC contains
an 1-Wire master. They are used for attaching One-Wire prom devices,
which contain information about part numbers, revision numbers,
serial number etc. and MAC addresses for ethernet interfaces.
This patch adds a master driver to support this IP block.
It also adds an extra field dev_id to struct w1_bus_master, which
could be in used in slave drivers for creating unique device names.
