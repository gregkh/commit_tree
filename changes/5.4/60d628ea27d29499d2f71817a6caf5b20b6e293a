ice: Reduce wait times during VF bringup/reset

Currently there are a couple places where the VF is waiting too long when
checking the status of registers. This is causing the AVF driver to
spin for longer than necessary in the __IAVF_STARTUP state. Sometimes
it causes the AVF to go into the __IAVF_COMM_FAILED, which may retrigger
the __IAVF_STARTUP state. Try to reduce the chance of this happening by
removing unnecessary wait times in VF bringup/resets.
