binder: Add binder_proc logging to binderfs

Currently /sys/kernel/debug/binder/proc contains
the debug data for every binder_proc instance.
This patch makes this information also available
in a binderfs instance mounted with a mount option
"stats=global" in addition to debugfs. The patch does
not affect the presence of the file in debugfs.

If a binderfs instance is mounted at path /dev/binderfs,
this file would be present at /dev/binderfs/binder_logs/proc.
This change provides an alternate way to access this file when debugfs
is not mounted.
