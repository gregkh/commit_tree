media: stm32-dcmi: Delete an unnecessary of_node_put() call in dcmi_probe()

A null pointer would be passed to a call of the function “of_node_put”
immediately after a call of the function “of_graph_get_next_endpoint”
failed at one place.
Remove this superfluous function call.

This issue was detected by using the Coccinelle software.
