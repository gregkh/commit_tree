recordmcount: Clarify what cleanup() does

cleanup() mostly frees/unmaps the malloc'd/privately-mapped
copy of the ELF file recordmcount is working on, which is
set up in mmap_file(). It also deals with positioning within
the pseduo prive-mapping of the file and appending to the ELF
file.

Split into two steps:
	mmap_cleanup() for the mapping itself
	file_append_cleanup() for allocations storing the
		appended ELF data.

Also, move the global variable initializations out of the main,
per-object-file loop and nearer to the alloc/init (mmap_file())
and two cleanup functions so we can more clearly see how they're
related.
