scsi: lpfc: Fix upcall to bsg done in non-success cases

The scsi transport fc bsg interface does not expect the bsg_job_done()
callback to be done if the bsg request call returns failure. Several of the
HST_VENDOR cases in the driver unconditionally call bsg_job_done()
regardless of the returning value.

Fix the code to only call bsg_job_done() if the call to lpfc_bsg_request()
will return success.
