btrfs: Make btrfs_find_name_in_ext_backref return struct btrfs_inode_extref

btrfs_find_name_in_ext_backref returns either 0/1 depending on whether it
found a backref for the given name. If it returns true then the actual
inode_ref struct is returned in one of its parameters. That's pointless,
instead refactor the function such that it returns either a pointer
to the btrfs_inode_extref or NULL it it didn't find anything. This
streamlines the function calling convention.
