x86: KVM: svm: eliminate hardcoded RIP advancement from vmrun_interception()

Just like we do with other intercepts, in vmrun_interception() we should be
doing kvm_skip_emulated_instruction() and not just RIP += 3. Also, it is
wrong to increment RIP before nested_svm_vmrun() as it can result in
kvm_inject_gp().

We can't call kvm_skip_emulated_instruction() after nested_svm_vmrun() so
move it inside.
