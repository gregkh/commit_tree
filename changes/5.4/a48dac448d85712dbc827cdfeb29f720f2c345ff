riscv: fp: add missing __user pointer annotations

The __user annotations were removed from the {save,restore}_fp_state()
function signatures by commit 007f5c358957 ("Refactor FPU code in
signal setup/return procedures"), but should be present, and sparse
warns when they are not applied.  Add them back in.

This change should have no functional impact.
