ASoC: Intel: Skylake: Limit large_config_get to single frame

Reply for the very first LARGE_CONFIG_GET request contains total size of
payload to be retrieved by host.
From then on, each subsequent reply carries buffer offset instead. As
looping is not covered by any real-life example, remove it and cleanup
the function for followup overhaul.
