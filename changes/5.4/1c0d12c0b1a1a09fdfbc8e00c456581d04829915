nvme: fail cancelled commands with NVME_SC_HOST_PATH_ERROR

NVME_SC_ABORT_REQ means that the request was aborted due to
an abort command received. In our case, this is a transport
cancellation, so host pathing error is much more appropriate.

Also, convert NVME_SC_HOST_PATH_ERROR to BLK_STS_TRANSPORT for
such that callers can understand that the status is a transport
related error. This will be used by the ns scanning code to
understand if it got an error from the controller or that the
controller happens to be unreachable by the transport.
