ext4: drop legacy pre-1970 encoding workaround

Originally, support for expanded timestamps had a bug in that pre-1970
times were erroneously encoded as being in the the 24th century.  This
was fixed in commit a4dad1ae24f8 ("ext4: Fix handling of extended
tv_sec") which landed in 4.4.  Starting with 4.4, pre-1970 timestamps
were correctly encoded, but for backwards compatibility those
incorrectly encoded timestamps were mapped back to the pre-1970 dates.

Given that backwards compatibility workaround has been around for 4
years, and given that running e2fsck from e2fsprogs 1.43.2 and later
will offer to fix these timestamps (which has been released for 3
years), it's past time to drop the legacy workaround from the kernel.
