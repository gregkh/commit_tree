ASoC: wm8994: Do not register inapplicable controls for WM1811

In case of WM1811 device there are currently being registered controls
referring to registers not existing on that device.
It has been noticed when getting values of "AIF1ADC2 Volume", "AIF1DAC2
Volume" controls was failing during ALSA state restoring at boot time:
 "amixer: Mixer hw:0 load error: Device or resource busy"

Reading some registers through I2C was failing with EBUSY error and
indeed these registers were not available according to the datasheet.

To fix this controls not available on WM1811 are moved to a separate
array and registered only for WM8994 and WM8958.

There are some further differences between WM8994 and WM1811,
e.g. registers 603h, 604h, 605h, which are not covered in this patch.
