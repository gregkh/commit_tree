hwmon: (k10temp) Update documentation and add temp2_input info

It's been a while since the k10temp documentation has been updated.
There are new CPU families supported as well as Tdie temp was added.
This patch adds all missing families which I was able to find from git
history and provides more info about Tctl vs Tdie exported temps.
