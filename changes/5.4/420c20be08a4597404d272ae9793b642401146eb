bcma: fix incorrect update of BCMA_CORE_PCI_MDIO_DATA

An earlier commit re-worked the setting of the bitmask and is now
assigning v with some bit flags rather than bitwise or-ing them
into v, consequently the earlier bit-settings of v are being lost.
Fix this by replacing an assignment with the bitwise or instead.
