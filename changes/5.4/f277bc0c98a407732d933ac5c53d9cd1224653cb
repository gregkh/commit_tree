drm/i915/selftests: Pass intel_context to igt_spinner

Teach igt_spinner to only use our internal structs, decoupling the
interface from the GEM contexts. This makes it easier to avoid
requiring ce->gem_context back references for kernel_context that may
have them in future.

v2: Lift engine lock to verify_wa() caller.
v3: Less than v2, but more so
