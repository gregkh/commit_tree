net: sched: use get_dev() action API in flow_action infra

When filling in hardware intermediate representation tc_setup_flow_action()
directly obtains, checks and takes reference to dev used by mirred action,
instead of using act->ops->get_dev() API created specifically for this
purpose. In order to remove code duplication, refactor flow_action infra to
use action API when obtaining mirred action target dev. Extend get_dev()
with additional argument that is used to provide dev destructor to the
user.
