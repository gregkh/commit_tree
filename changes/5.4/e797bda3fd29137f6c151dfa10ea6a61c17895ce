smp/hotplug: Track booted once CPUs in a cpumask

The booted once information which is required to deal with the MCE
broadcast issue on X86 correctly is stored in the per cpu hotplug state,
which is perfectly fine for the intended purpose.

X86 needs that information for supporting NMI broadcasting via shortcuts,
but retrieving it from per cpu data is cumbersome.

Move it to a cpumask so the information can be checked against the
cpu_present_mask quickly.

No functional change intended.
