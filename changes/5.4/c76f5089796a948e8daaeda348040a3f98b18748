mtd: spi-nor: Rework hwcaps selection for the spi-mem case

The spi-mem layer provides a spi_mem_supports_op() function to check
whether a specific operation is supported by the controller or not.
This is much more accurate than the hwcaps selection logic based on
SPI_{RX,TX}_ flags.

Rework the hwcaps selection logic to use spi_mem_supports_op() when
nor->spimem != NULL.
