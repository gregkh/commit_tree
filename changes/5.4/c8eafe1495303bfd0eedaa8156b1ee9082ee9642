x86/resctrl: Fix potential lockdep warning

rdtgroup_cpus_write() and mkdir_rdt_prepare() call
rdtgroup_kn_lock_live() -> kernfs_to_rdtgroup() to get 'rdtgrp', and
then call the rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts,...}() functions which will check
if rdtgroup_mutex is held/requires its caller to hold rdtgroup_mutex.

But if 'rdtgrp' returned from kernfs_to_rdtgroup() is NULL,
rdtgroup_mutex is not held and calling rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts,...}()
will result in a self-incurred, potential lockdep warning.

Remove the rdt_last_cmd_{clear,puts,...}() calls in these two paths.
Just returning error should be sufficient to report to the user that the
entry doesn't exist any more.
