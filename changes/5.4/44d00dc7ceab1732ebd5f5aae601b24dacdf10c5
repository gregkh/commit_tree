tracing/probe: Fix to allow user to enable events on unloaded modules

Fix to allow user to enable probe events on unloaded modules.

This operations was allowed before commit 60d53e2c3b75 ("tracing/probe:
Split trace_event related data from trace_probe"), because if users
need to probe module init functions, they have to enable those probe
events before loading module.
