usb: gadget: net2280: Add workaround for AB chip Errata 11

The errata description is:

Workaround for Default Duration of LFPS Handshake Signaling for
Device-Initiated U1 Exit is too short.

The default duration of the LFPS handshake generated by USB3380 for a device-initiated U1-exit may not be
long enough for certain SuperSpeed downstream ports (SuperSpeed hubs/hosts) to recognize. This could lead
to USB3380 entering the recovery state pre-maturely and ending up in the SS.Inactive state.

I have observed various enumeration failures, seemingly related to
lost transactions or SETUP status phases on modern hosts (typically
thunderbolt capable systems) without this workaround.
