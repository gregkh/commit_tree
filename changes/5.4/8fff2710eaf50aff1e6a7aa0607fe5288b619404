KVM: VMX: Remove EMULATE_FAIL handling in handle_invalid_guest_state()

Now that EMULATE_FAIL is completely unused, remove the last remaning
usage where KVM does something functional in response to EMULATE_FAIL.
Leave the check in place as a WARN_ON_ONCE to provide a better paper
trail when EMULATE_{DONE,FAIL,USER_EXIT} are completely removed.

Opportunistically remove the gotos in handle_invalid_guest_state().
With the EMULATE_FAIL handling gone there is no need to have a common
handler for emulation failure and the gotos only complicate things,
e.g. the signal_pending() check always returns '1', but this is far
from obvious when glancing through the code.
