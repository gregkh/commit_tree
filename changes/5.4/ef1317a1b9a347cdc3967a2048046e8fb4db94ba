btrfs: do not allow reservations if we have pending tickets

If we already have tickets on the list we don't want to steal their
reservations.  This is a preparation patch for upcoming changes,
technically this shouldn't happen today because of the way we add bytes
to tickets before adding them to the space_info in most cases.

This does not change the FIFO nature of reserve tickets, it simply
allows us to enforce it in a different way.  Previously it was enforced
because any new space would be added to the first ticket on the list,
which would result in new reservations getting a reserve ticket.  This
replaces that mechanism by simply checking to see if we have outstanding
reserve tickets and skipping straight to adding a ticket for our
reservation.
