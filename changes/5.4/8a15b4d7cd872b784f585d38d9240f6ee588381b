block: bypass blk_set_runtime_active for uninitialized q->dev

Some devices may skip blk_pm_runtime_init() and have null pointer
in its request_queue->dev. For example, SCSI devices of UFS Well-Known
LUNs.

Currently the null pointer is checked by the user of
blk_set_runtime_active(), i.e., scsi_dev_type_resume(). It is better to
check it by blk_set_runtime_active() itself instead of by its users.
