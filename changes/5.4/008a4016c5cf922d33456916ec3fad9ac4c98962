drm/amd/display: Set FEC_READY always before link training

[why]
Right now we FEC_READY is set only before the final link training,
i.e. at mode set time. This means FEC_READY won't be set when doing
link training as a response to HPD. It also fails UCD400 FEC test in
DP compliance.

[how]
Move FEC_READY setup to link training.
