rcu/nocb: Allow lockless use of rcu_segcblist_empty()

Currently, rcu_segcblist_empty() assumes that the callback list is not
being changed by other CPUs, but upcoming changes will require it to
operate locklessly.  This commit therefore adds the needed READ_ONCE()
call, along with the WRITE_ONCE() calls when updating the callback list's
->head field.
