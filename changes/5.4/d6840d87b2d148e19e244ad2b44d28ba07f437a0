perf parser: Remove needless include directives

They go on accumulating there like the debug.h one, that was introduced
here:

  f23610245c1a ("perf list: Add debug support for outputing alias string")

But then, when that need is removed via:

  2073ad3326b7 ("perf tools: Factor out PMU matching in parser")

The thing stays there, so continue the house cleaning spree...

list.h not needed, no macros from there are used, and 'struct
list_head' is in linux/types.h, ditto for util.h, no need for that as
well.
