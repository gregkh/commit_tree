fq_codel: Kill useless per-flow dropped statistic

It is almost impossible to get anything other than a 0 out of
flow->dropped statistic with a tc class dump, as it resets to 0
on every round.

It also conflates ecn marks with drops.

It would have been useful had it kept a cumulative drop count, but
it doesn't. This patch doesn't change the API, it just stops
tracking a stat and state that is impossible to measure and nobody
uses.
