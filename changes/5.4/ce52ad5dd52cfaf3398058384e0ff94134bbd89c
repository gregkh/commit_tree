drm/i915: Fix wrong escape clock divisor init for GLK

According to Bspec clock divisor registers in GeminiLake
should be initialized by shifting 1(<<) to amount of correspondent
divisor. While i915 was writing all this time that value as is.

Surprisingly that it by accident worked, until we met some issues
with Microtech Etab.

v2: Added Fixes tag and cc
v3: Added stable to cc as well.
