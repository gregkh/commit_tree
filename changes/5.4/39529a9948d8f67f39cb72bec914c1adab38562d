libbpf: Teach btf_dumper to emit stand-alone anonymous enum definitions

BTF-to-C converter previously skipped anonymous enums in an assumption
that those are embedded in struct's field definitions. This is not
always the case and a lot of kernel constants are defined as part of
anonymous enums. This change fixes the logic by eagerly marking all
types as either referenced by any other type or not. This is enough to
distinguish two classes of anonymous enums and emit previously omitted
enum definitions.
