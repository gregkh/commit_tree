USB: typec: ucsi_ccg: convert i2c driver to use dev_groups

The driver core now supports the option to automatically create and
remove any needed sysfs attribute files for a driver when the device is
bound/removed from it.  Convert the uscsi_ccg code to use that instead
of trying to create sysfs files "by hand".
