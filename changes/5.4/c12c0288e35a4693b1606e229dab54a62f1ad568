perf/imx_ddr: Add support for AXI ID filtering

AXI filtering is used by events 0x41 and 0x42 to count reads or writes
with an ARID or AWID matching a specified filter. The filter is exposed
to userspace as an (ID, MASK) pair, where each set bit in the mask
causes the corresponding bit in the ID to be ignored when matching
against the ID of memory transactions for the purposes of incrementing
the counter.

For example:

  # perf stat -a -e imx8_ddr0/axid-read,axi_mask=0xff,axi_id=0x800/ cmd

will count all read transactions from AXI IDs 0x800 - 0x8ff. If the
'axi_mask' is omitted, then it is treated as 0x0 which means that the
'axi_id' will be matched exactly.
