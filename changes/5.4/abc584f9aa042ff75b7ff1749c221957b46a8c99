drm/i915: Convert i915_gem_init_hw to intel_gt

More removal of implicit dev_priv from using old mmio accessors.

Actually the top level function remains but is split into a part which
writes to i915 and part which operates on intel_gt in order to initialize
the hardware.

GuC and engines are the only odd ones out remaining.
