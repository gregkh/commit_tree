cifs: Fix cifsInodeInfo lock_sem deadlock when reconnect occurs

There's a deadlock that is possible and can easily be seen with
a test where multiple readers open/read/close of the same file
and a disruption occurs causing reconnect.  The deadlock is due
a reader thread inside cifs_strict_readv calling down_read and
obtaining lock_sem, and then after reconnect inside
cifs_reopen_file calling down_read a second time.  If in
between the two down_read calls, a down_write comes from
another process, deadlock occurs.

cifs_strict_readv()
 down_read(&cifsi->lock_sem);
                               _cifsFileInfo_put
                                  OR
                               cifs_new_fileinfo
                                down_write(&cifsi->lock_sem);
cifs_reopen_file()
 down_read(&cifsi->lock_sem);

Fix the above by changing all down_write(lock_sem) calls to
down_write_trylock(lock_sem)/msleep() loop, which in turn
makes the second down_read call benign since it will never
block behind the writer while holding lock_sem.
