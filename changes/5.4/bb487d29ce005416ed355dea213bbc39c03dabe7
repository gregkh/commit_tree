         ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fix it by using the new strscpy_pad() since the commit 458a3bf82df4
("lib/string: Add strscpy_pad() function") which will always
NUL-terminate the string, and avoid possibly leak data through the ring
buffer where non-admin account might enable these events through perf.
