media: dt-bindings: media: Add Allwinner A10 CSI binding

The Allwinner A10 CMOS Sensor Interface is a camera capture interface also
used in later (A10s, A13, A20, R8 and GR8) SoCs.

On some SoCs, like the A10, there's multiple instances of that controller,
with one instance supporting more channels and having an ISP.
