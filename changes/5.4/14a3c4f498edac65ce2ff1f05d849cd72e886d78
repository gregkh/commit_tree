KVM: x86/mmu: Revert "Revert "KVM: MMU: add tracepoint for kvm_mmu_invalidate_all_pages""

Now that the fast invalidate mechanism has been reintroduced, restore
the tracepoint associated with said mechanism.

Note, the name of the tracepoint deviates from the original tracepoint
so as to match KVM's current nomenclature.

This reverts commit 42560fb1f3c6c7f730897b7fa7a478bc37e0be50.
