drm/drv: Use // for comments in example code

This improves Sphinx output in two ways:

- It avoids an unmatched single-quote ('), about which Sphinx complained:

    Documentation/gpu/drm-internals.rst:298:
    WARNING: Could not lex literal_block as "c". Highlighting skipped.

  An alternative approach would be to replace "can't" with a word that
  doesn't have a single-quote.

- It lets Sphinx format the comments in italics and grey, making the
  code slightly easier to read.
