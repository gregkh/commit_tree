of/platform: Pause/resume sync state during init and of_platform_populate()

When all the top level devices are populated from DT during kernel
init, the supplier devices could be added and probed before the
consumer devices are added and linked to the suppliers. To avoid the
sync_state() callback from being called prematurely, pause the
sync_state() callbacks before populating the devices and resume them
at late_initcall_sync().

Similarly, when children devices are populated after kernel init using
of_platform_populate(), there could be supplier-consumer dependencies
between the children devices that are populated. To avoid the same
problem with sync_state() being called prematurely, pause and resume
sync_state() callbacks across of_platform_populate().
