net/mlx5: Fix auto group size calculation

Once all the large flow groups (defined by the user when the flow table
is created - max_num_groups) were created, then all the following new
flow groups will have only one flow table entry, even though the flow table
has place to larger groups.
Fix the condition to prefer large flow group.
