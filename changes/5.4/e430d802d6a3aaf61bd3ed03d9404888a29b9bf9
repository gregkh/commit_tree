timer: Read jiffies once when forwarding base clk

The timer delayed for more than 3 seconds warning was triggered during
testing.

  Workqueue: events_unbound sched_tick_remote
  RIP: 0010:sched_tick_remote+0xee/0x100
  ...
  Call Trace:
   process_one_work+0x18c/0x3a0
   worker_thread+0x30/0x380
   kthread+0x113/0x130
   ret_from_fork+0x22/0x40

The reason is that the code in collect_expired_timers() uses jiffies
unprotected:

    if (next_event > jiffies)
        base->clk = jiffies;

As the compiler is allowed to reload the value base->clk can advance
between the check and the store and in the worst case advance farther than
next event. That causes the timer expiry to be delayed until the wheel
pointer wraps around.

Convert the code to use READ_ONCE()
