ath10k: fix channel info parsing for non tlv target

The tlv targets such as WCN3990 send more data in the chan info event, which is
not sent by the non tlv targets. There is a minimum size check in the wmi event
for non-tlv targets and hence we cannot update the common channel info
structure as it was done in commit 13104929d2ec ("ath10k: fill the channel
survey results for WCN3990 correctly"). This broke channel survey results on
10.x firmware versions.

If the common channel info structure is updated, the size check for chan info
event for non-tlv targets will fail and return -EPROTO and we see the below
error messages

   ath10k_pci 0000:01:00.0: failed to parse chan info event: -71

Add tlv specific channel info structure and restore the original size of the
common channel info structure to mitigate this issue.
