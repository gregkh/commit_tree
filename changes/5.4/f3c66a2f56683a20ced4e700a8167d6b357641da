xprtrdma: Boost maximum transport header size

Although I haven't seen any performance results that justify it,
I've received several complaints that NFS/RDMA no longer supports
a maximum rsize and wsize of 1MB. These days it is somewhat smaller.

To simplify the logic that determines whether a chunk list is
necessary, the implementation uses a fixed maximum size of the
transport header. Currently that maximum size is 256 bytes, one
quarter of the default inline threshold size for RPC/RDMA v1.

Since commit a78868497c2e ("xprtrdma: Reduce max_frwr_depth"), the
size of chunks is also smaller to take advantage of inline page
lists in device internal MR data structures.

The combination of these two design choices has reduced the maximum
NFS rsize and wsize that can be used for most RNIC/HCAs. Increasing
the maximum transport header size and the maximum number of RDMA
segments it can contain increases the negotiated maximum rsize/wsize
on common RNIC/HCAs.
