erofs: move erofs out of staging

EROFS filesystem has been merged into linux-staging for a year.

EROFS is designed to be a better solution of saving extra storage
space with guaranteed end-to-end performance for read-only files
with the help of reduced metadata, fixed-sized output compression
and decompression inplace technologies.

In the past year, EROFS was greatly improved by many people as
a staging driver, self-tested, betaed by a large number of our
internal users, successfully applied to almost all in-service
HUAWEI smartphones as the part of EMUI 9.1 and proven to be stable
enough to be moved out of staging.

EROFS is a self-contained filesystem driver. Although there are
still some TODOs to be more generic, we have a dedicated team
actively keeping on working on EROFS in order to make it better
with the evolution of Linux kernel as the other in-kernel filesystems.

As Pavel suggested, it's better to do as one commit since git
can do moves and all histories will be saved in this way.

Let's promote it from staging and enhance it more actively as
a "real" part of kernel for more wider scenarios!
