arm64: memory: Rewrite default page_to_virt()/virt_to_page()

The default implementations of page_to_virt() and virt_to_page() are
fairly confusing to read and the former evaluates its 'page' parameter
twice in the macro

Rewrite them so that the computation is expressed as 'base + index' in
both cases and the parameter is always evaluated exactly once.
