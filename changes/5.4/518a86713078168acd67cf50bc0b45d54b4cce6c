mm/vmpressure.c: fix a signedness bug in vmpressure_register_event()

The "mode" and "level" variables are enums and in this context GCC will
treat them as unsigned ints so the error handling is never triggered.

I also removed the bogus initializer because it isn't required any more
and it's sort of confusing.
