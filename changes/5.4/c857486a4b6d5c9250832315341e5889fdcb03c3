net: dsa: mv88e6xxx: introduce invalid_port_mask in mv88e6xxx_info

With this it is possible to mark certain chip ports as invalid. This is
required for example for the MV88E6220 (which is in general a MV88E6250
with 7 ports) but the ports 2-4 are not routed to pins.

If a user configures an invalid port, an error is returned.
