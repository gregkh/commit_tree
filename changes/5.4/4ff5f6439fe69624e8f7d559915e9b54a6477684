ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: fix warnings during FW load

The "snd_pcm_substream" handle was not initialized properly
in hda-loader.c for firmware load.

When the HDA DMAs were used to load the firmware,
the interrupts related to firmware load also triggered
calls to snd_sof_pcm_period_elapsed() on a non-existent ALSA
PCM stream.

This caused runtime kernel warnings from
pcm_lib.c:snd_pcm_period_elapsed().
