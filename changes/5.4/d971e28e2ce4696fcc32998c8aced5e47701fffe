EDAC/amd64: Support more than two controllers for chip selects handling

The struct chip_select array that's used for saving chip select bases
and masks is fixed at length of two. There should be one struct
chip_select for each controller, so this array should be increased to
support systems that may have more than two controllers.

Increase the size of the struct chip_select array to eight, which is the
largest number of controllers per die currently supported on AMD
systems.

Fix number of DIMMs and Chip Select bases/masks on Family17h, because
AMD Family 17h systems support 2 DIMMs, 4 CS bases, and 2 CS masks per
channel.

Also, carve out the Family 17h+ reading of the bases/masks into a
separate function. This effectively reverts the original bases/masks
reading code to before Family 17h support was added.
