ceph: fix directories inode i_blkbits initialization

When filling an inode with info from the MDS, i_blkbits is being
initialized using fl_stripe_unit, which contains the stripe unit in
bytes.  Unfortunately, this doesn't make sense for directories as they
have fl_stripe_unit set to '0'.  This means that i_blkbits will be set
to 0xff, causing an UBSAN undefined behaviour in i_blocksize():

  UBSAN: Undefined behaviour in ./include/linux/fs.h:731:12
  shift exponent 255 is too large for 32-bit type 'int'

Fix this by initializing i_blkbits to CEPH_BLOCK_SHIFT if fl_stripe_unit
is zero.
