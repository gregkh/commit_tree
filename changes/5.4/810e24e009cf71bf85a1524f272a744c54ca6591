mm/mmu_notifiers: annotate with might_sleep()

Since mmu notifiers don't exist for many processes, but could block in
interesting places, add some annotations. This should help make sure the
core mm keeps up its end of the mmu notifier contract.

The checks here are outside of all notifier checks because of that.
They compile away without CONFIG_DEBUG_ATOMIC_SLEEP.
