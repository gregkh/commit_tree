spi: spi-fsl-dspi: Remove impossible to reach error check

dspi->devtype_data is under the total control of the driver. Therefore,
a bad value is a driver bug and checking it at runtime (and during an
ISR, at that!) is pointless.

The second "else if" check is only for clarity (instead of a broader
"else") in case other transfer modes are added in the future. But the
printing is dead code and can be removed.
