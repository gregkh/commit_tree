sched/cpufreq: Align trace event behavior of fast switching

Fast switching path only emits an event for the CPU of interest, whereas the
regular path emits an event for all the CPUs that had their frequency changed,
i.e. all the CPUs sharing the same policy.

With the current behavior, looking at cpu_frequency event for a given CPU that
is using the fast switching path will not give the correct frequency signal.
