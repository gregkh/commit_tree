drm/panfrost: Rework runtime PM initialization

There's a few issues with the runtime PM initialization.

The documentation states pm_runtime_set_active() should be called before
pm_runtime_enable(). The pm_runtime_put_autosuspend() could suspend the GPU
before panfrost_perfcnt_init() is called which touches the h/w. The
autosuspend delay keeps things from breaking. There's no need explicitly
power off the GPU only to wake back up with pm_runtime_get_sync(). Just
delaying pm_runtime_enable to the end of probe is sufficient.

Lets move all the runtime PM calls into the probe() function so they are
all in one place and are done after all initialization.
