iio: adc: hx711: fix bug in sampling of data

Fix bug in sampling function hx711_cycle() when interrupt occures while
PD_SCK is high. If PD_SCK is high for at least 60 us power down mode of
the sensor is entered which in turn leads to a wrong measurement.

Switch off interrupts during a PD_SCK high period and move query of DOUT
to the latest point of time which is at the end of PD_SCK low period.

This bug exists in the driver since it's initial addition. The more
interrupts on the system the higher is the probability that it happens.
