KVM: x86: Return to userspace with internal error on unexpected exit reason

Receiving an unexpected exit reason from hardware should be considered
as a severe bug in KVM. Therefore, instead of just injecting #UD to
guest and ignore it, exit to userspace on internal error so that
it could handle it properly (probably by terminating guest).

In addition, prefer to use vcpu_unimpl() instead of WARN_ONCE()
as handling unexpected exit reason should be a rare unexpected
event (that was expected to never happen) and we prefer to print
a message on it every time it occurs to guest.

Furthermore, dump VMCS/VMCB to dmesg to assist diagnosing such cases.
