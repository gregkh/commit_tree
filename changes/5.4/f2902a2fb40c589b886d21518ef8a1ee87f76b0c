powerpc: use the generic dma coherent remap allocator

This switches to using common code for the DMA allocations, including
potential use of the CMA allocator if configured.

Switching to the generic code enables DMA allocations from atomic
context, which is required by the DMA API documentation, and also
adds various other minor features drivers start relying upon.  It
also makes sure we have on tested code base for all architectures
that require uncached pte bits for coherent DMA allocations.

Another advantage is that consistent memory allocations now share
the general vmalloc pool instead of needing an explicit careout
from it.
