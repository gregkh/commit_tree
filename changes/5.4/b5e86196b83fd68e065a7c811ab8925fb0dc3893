iommu/arm-smmu-v3: Disable detection of ATS and PRI

Detecting the ATS capability of the SMMU at probe time introduces a
spinlock into the ->unmap() fast path, even when ATS is not actually
in use. Furthermore, the ATC invalidation that exists is broken, as it
occurs before invalidation of the main SMMU TLB which leaves a window
where the ATC can be repopulated with stale entries.

Given that ATS is both a new feature and a specialist sport, disable it
for now whilst we fix it properly in subsequent patches. Since PRI
requires ATS, disable that too.
