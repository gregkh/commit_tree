phy: renesas: rcar-gen3-usb2: Disable clearing VBUS in over-current

The hardware manual should be revised, but the initial value of
VBCTRL.OCCLREN is set to 1 actually. If the bit is set, the hardware
clears VBCTRL.VBOUT and ADPCTRL.DRVVBUS registers automatically
when the hardware detects over-current signal from a USB power switch.
However, since the hardware doesn't have any registers which
indicates over-current, the driver cannot handle it at all. So, if
"is_otg_channel" hardware detects over-current, since ADPCTRL.DRVVBUS
register is cleared automatically, the channel cannot be used after
that.

To resolve this behavior, this patch sets the VBCTRL.OCCLREN to 0
to keep ADPCTRL.DRVVBUS even if the "is_otg_channel" hardware
detects over-current. (We assume a USB power switch itself protects
over-current and turns the VBUS off.)

This patch is inspired by a BSP patch from Kazuya Mizuguchi.
