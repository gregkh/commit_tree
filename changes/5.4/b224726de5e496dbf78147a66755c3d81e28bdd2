nvme-pci: Fix a race in controller removal

User space programs like udevd may try to read to partitions at the
same time the driver detects a namespace is unusable, and may deadlock
if revalidate_disk() is called while such a process is waiting to
enter the frozen queue. On detecting a dead namespace, move the disk
revalidate after unblocking dispatchers that may be holding bd_butex.
