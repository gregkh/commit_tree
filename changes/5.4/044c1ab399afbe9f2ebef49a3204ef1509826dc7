io_uring: don't touch ctx in setup after ring fd install

syzkaller reported an issue where it looks like a malicious app can
trigger a use-after-free of reading the ctx ->sq_array and ->rings
value right after having installed the ring fd in the process file
table.

Defer ring fd installation until after we're done reading those
values.
