can: c_can: D_CAN: c_can_chip_config(): perform a sofware reset on open

When the CAN interface is closed it the hardwre is put in power down
mode, but does not reset the error counters / state. Reset the D_CAN on
open, so the reported state and the actual state match.

According to [1], the C_CAN module doesn't have the software reset.
