x86/cpu/vmware: Fix platform detection VMWARE_PORT macro

The platform detection VMWARE_PORT macro uses the VMWARE_HYPERVISOR_PORT
definition, but expects it to be an integer. However, when it was moved
to the new vmware.h include file, it was changed to be a string to better
fit into the VMWARE_HYPERCALL set of macros. This obviously breaks the
platform detection VMWARE_PORT functionality.

Change the VMWARE_HYPERVISOR_PORT and VMWARE_HYPERVISOR_PORT_HB
definitions to be integers, and use __stringify() for their stringified
form when needed.
