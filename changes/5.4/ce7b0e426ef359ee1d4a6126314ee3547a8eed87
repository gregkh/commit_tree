perf record: Add an option to take an AUX snapshot on exit

It is sometimes useful to generate a snapshot when perf record exits;
I've been using a wrapper script around the workload that would do a
killall -USR2 perf when the workload exits.

This patch makes it easier and also works when perf record is attached
to a pre-existing task. A new snapshot option 'e' can be specified in
-S to enable this behavior:

root@elsewhere:~# perf record -e intel_pt// -Se sleep 1
[ perf record: Woken up 2 times to write data ]
[ perf record: Captured and wrote 0.085 MB perf.data ]
