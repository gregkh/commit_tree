net/mlx5e: RX, Handle CQE with error at the earliest stage

Just to be aligned with the MPWQE handlers, handle RX WQE with error
for legacy RQs in the top RX handlers, just before calling skb_from_cqe().

CQE error handling will now be called at the same stage regardless of
the RQ type or netdev mode NIC, Representor, IPoIB, etc ..

This will be useful for down stream patch to improve error CQE
handling.
