net/rds: Add a few missing rds_stat_names entries

In a previous commit, fields were added to "struct rds_statistics"
but array "rds_stat_names" was not updated accordingly.

Please note the inconsistent naming of the string representations
that is done in the name of compatibility
with the Oracle internal code-base.

s_recv_bytes_added_to_socket     -> "recv_bytes_added_to_sock"
s_recv_bytes_removed_from_socket -> "recv_bytes_freed_fromsock"

Fixes: 192a798f5299 ("RDS: add stat for socket recv memory usage")
