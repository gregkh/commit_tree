module: move CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS to the sub-menu of MODULES

When CONFIG_MODULES is disabled, CONFIG_UNUSED_SYMBOLS is pointless,
thus it should be invisible.

Instead of adding "depends on MODULES", I moved it to the sub-menu
"Enable loadable module support", which is a better fit. I put it
close to TRIM_UNUSED_KSYMS because it depends on !UNUSED_SYMBOLS.
