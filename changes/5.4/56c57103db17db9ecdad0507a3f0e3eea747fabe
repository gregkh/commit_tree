mm/mmu_notifiers: hoist do_mmu_notifier_register down_write to the caller

This simplifies the code to not have so many one line functions and extra
logic. __mmu_notifier_register() simply becomes the entry point to
register the notifier, and the other one calls it under lock.

Also add a lockdep_assert to check that the callers are holding the lock
as expected.
