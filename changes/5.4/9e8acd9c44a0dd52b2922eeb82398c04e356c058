bpf: lwtunnel: Fix reroute supplying invalid dst

The dst in bpf_input() has lwtstate field set. As it is of the
LWTUNNEL_ENCAP_BPF type, lwtstate->data is struct bpf_lwt. When the bpf
program returns BPF_LWT_REROUTE, ip_route_input_noref is directly called on
this skb. This causes invalid memory access, as ip_route_input_slow calls
skb_tunnel_info(skb) that expects the dst->lwstate->data to be
struct ip_tunnel_info. This results to struct bpf_lwt being accessed as
struct ip_tunnel_info.

Drop the dst before calling the IP route input functions (both for IPv4 and
IPv6).
