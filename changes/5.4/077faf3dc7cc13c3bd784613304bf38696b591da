libtraceevent: Move traceevent plugins in its own subdirectory

All traceevent plugins code is moved to tools/lib/traceevent/plugins
subdirectory. It makes traceevent implementation in trace-cmd and in
kernel tree consistent. There is no changes in the way libtraceevent and
plugins are compiled and installed.

Committer notes:

Applied fixup provided by Steven, fixing the tools/perf/Makefile.perf
target for the plugin dynamic list file. Problem noticed when cross
building to aarch64 from a Ubuntu 19.04 container.
