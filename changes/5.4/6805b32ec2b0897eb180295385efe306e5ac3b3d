io_uring: remove wait loop spurious wakeups

Any changes interesting to tasks waiting in io_cqring_wait() are
commited with io_cqring_ev_posted(). However, io_ring_drop_ctx_refs()
also tries to do that but with no reason, that means spurious wakeups
every io_free_req() and io_uring_enter().

Just use percpu_ref_put() instead.
