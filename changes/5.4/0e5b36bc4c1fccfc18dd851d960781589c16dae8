r8152: adjust the settings of ups flags

The UPS feature only works for runtime suspend, so UPS flags only
need to be set before enabling runtime suspend. Therefore, I create
a struct to record relative information, and use it before runtime
suspend.

All chips could record such information, even though not all of
them support the feature of UPS. Then, some functions could be
combined.
