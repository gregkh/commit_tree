ALSA: usb-audio: Skip bSynchAddress endpoint check if it is invalid

The Linux kernel assumes that get_endpoint(alts,0) and
get_endpoint(alts,1) are eachothers feedback endpoints.
To reassure that validity it will test bsynchaddress to comply with that
assumption. But if the bsyncaddress is 0 (invalid), it will flag that as
a wrong assumption and return an error.
Fix: Skip the test if bSynchAddress is 0.
Note: those with a valid bSynchAddress should have a code quirck added.
