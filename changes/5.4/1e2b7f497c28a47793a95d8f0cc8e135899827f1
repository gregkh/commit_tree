drm/i915: Add test for invalid flag bits in whitelist entries

As per review feedback by Tvrtko, added a check that no invalid bits
are being set in the whitelist flags fields.

Also updated the read/write access definitions to make it clearer that
they are an enum field not a set of single bit flags.
