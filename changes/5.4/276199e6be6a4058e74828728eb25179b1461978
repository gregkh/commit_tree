drm/i915/tgl: rename TRANSCODER_EDP_VDSC to use on transcoder A

On TGL the special EDP transcoder is gone and it should be handled by
transcoder A.

v2 (Lucas):
  - Reuse POWER_DOMAIN_TRANSCODER_EDP_VDSC (suggested by Ville)
  - Use crtc->dev since new_crtc_state->state may be NULL on atomic
    commit (suggested by Maarten)
v3 (Lucas):
  - Rename power domain so it's clear it can also be used for transcoder
    A in TGL (requested by José and Manasi)
