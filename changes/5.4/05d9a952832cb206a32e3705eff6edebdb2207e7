powerpc/prom_init: Undo relocation before entering secure mode

The ultravisor will do an integrity check of the kernel image but we
relocated it so the check will fail. Restore the original image by
relocating it back to the kernel virtual base address.

This works because during build vmlinux is linked with an expected
virtual runtime address of KERNELBASE.
