ice: Fix kernel hang with DCB reset in CEE mode

This patch fixes the set local MIB AQ call failures in the DCB rebuild path
by setting the defaults for the ETS recommended DCB configuration. Also,
willing bits for the DCB configuration needs to be set correctly. Resets
works fine in IEEE mode as the ETS recommended DCB configuration is
populated but not in CEE mode.
Without this patch, PFR causes the kernel hang in CEE mode.
