clk: Constify struct clk_bulk_data * where possible

The following functions:

    - clk_bulk_enable()
    - clk_bulk_prepare()
    - clk_bulk_disable()
    - clk_bulk_unprepare()

already expect const clk_bulk_data * as a second parameter, however
their no-op version have mismatching prototypes that don't. Fix that.

While at it, constify the second argument of clk_bulk_prepare_enable()
and clk_bulk_disable_unprepare(), since the functions they are
comprised of already accept const clk_bulk_data *.
