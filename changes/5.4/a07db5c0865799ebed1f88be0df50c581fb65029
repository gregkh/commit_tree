sched/core: Fix CPU controller for !RT_GROUP_SCHED

On !CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED configurations it is currently not possible to
move RT tasks between cgroups to which CPU controller has been attached;
but it is oddly possible to first move tasks around and then make them
RT (setschedule to FIFO/RR).

E.g.:

  # mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/group1
  # chrt -fp 10 $$
  # echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/group1/tasks
  bash: echo: write error: Invalid argument
  # chrt -op 0 $$
  # echo $$ > /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/group1/tasks
  # chrt -fp 10 $$
  # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu,cpuacct/group1/tasks
  2345
  2598
  # chrt -p 2345
  pid 2345's current scheduling policy: SCHED_FIFO
  pid 2345's current scheduling priority: 10

Also, as Michal noted, it is currently not possible to enable CPU
controller on unified hierarchy with !CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED (if there
are any kernel RT threads in root cgroup, they can't be migrated to the
newly created CPU controller's root in cgroup_update_dfl_csses()).

Existing code comes with a comment saying the "we don't support RT-tasks
being in separate groups". Such comment is however stale and belongs to
pre-RT_GROUP_SCHED times. Also, it doesn't make much sense for
!RT_GROUP_ SCHED configurations, since checks related to RT bandwidth
are not performed at all in these cases.

Make moving RT tasks between CPU controller groups viable by removing
special case check for RT (and DEADLINE) tasks.
