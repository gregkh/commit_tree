stacktrace: Don't skip first entry on noncurrent tasks

When doing cat /proc/<PID>/stack, the output is missing the first entry.
When the current code walks the stack starting in stack_trace_save_tsk,
it skips all scheduler functions (that's OK) plus one more function. But
this one function should be skipped only for the 'current' task as it is
stack_trace_save_tsk proper.

The original code (before the common infrastructure) skipped one
function only for the 'current' task -- see save_stack_trace_tsk before
3599fe12a125. So do so also in the new infrastructure now.
