io_uring: limit parallelism of buffered writes

All the popular filesystems need to grab the inode lock for buffered
writes. With io_uring punting buffered writes to async context, we
observe a lot of contention with all workers hamming this mutex.

For buffered writes, we generally don't need a lot of parallelism on
the submission side, as the flushing will take care of that for us.
Hence we don't need a deep queue on the write side, as long as we
can safely punt from the original submission context.

Add a workqueue with a limit of 2 that we can use for buffered writes.
This greatly improves the performance and efficiency of higher queue
depth buffered async writes with io_uring.
