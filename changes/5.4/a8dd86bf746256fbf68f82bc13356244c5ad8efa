checkpatch.pl: warn on invalid commit id

It can happen that a commit message refers to an invalid commit id,
because the referenced hash changed following a rebase, or simply by
mistake.  Add a check in checkpatch.pl which checks that an hash
referenced by a Fixes tag, or just cited in the commit message, is a valid
commit id.
