KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix race in re-enabling XIVE escalation interrupts

Escalation interrupts are interrupts sent to the host by the XIVE
hardware when it has an interrupt to deliver to a guest VCPU but that
VCPU is not running anywhere in the system.  Hence we disable the
escalation interrupt for the VCPU being run when we enter the guest
and re-enable it when the guest does an H_CEDE hypercall indicating
it is idle.

It is possible that an escalation interrupt gets generated just as we
are entering the guest.  In that case the escalation interrupt may be
using a queue entry in one of the interrupt queues, and that queue
entry may not have been processed when the guest exits with an H_CEDE.
The existing entry code detects this situation and does not clear the
vcpu->arch.xive_esc_on flag as an indication that there is a pending
queue entry (if the queue entry gets processed, xive_esc_irq() will
clear the flag).  There is a comment in the code saying that if the
flag is still set on H_CEDE, we have to abort the cede rather than
re-enabling the escalation interrupt, lest we end up with two
occurrences of the escalation interrupt in the interrupt queue.

However, the exit code doesn't do that; it aborts the cede in the sense
that vcpu->arch.ceded gets cleared, but it still enables the escalation
interrupt by setting the source's PQ bits to 00.  Instead we need to
set the PQ bits to 10, indicating that an interrupt has been triggered.
We also need to avoid setting vcpu->arch.xive_esc_on in this case
(i.e. vcpu->arch.xive_esc_on seen to be set on H_CEDE) because
xive_esc_irq() will run at some point and clear it, and if we race with
that we may end up with an incorrect result (i.e. xive_esc_on set when
the escalation interrupt has just been handled).

It is extremely unlikely that having two queue entries would cause
observable problems; theoretically it could cause queue overflow, but
the CPU would have to have thousands of interrupts targetted to it for
that to be possible.  However, this fix will also make it possible to
determine accurately whether there is an unhandled escalation
interrupt in the queue, which will be needed by the following patch.
