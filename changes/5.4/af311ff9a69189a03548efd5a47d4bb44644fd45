firmware: qcom_scm: Cleanup code in qcom_scm_assign_mem()

There are some questionable coding styles in this function. It looks
quite odd to deref a pointer with array indexing that only uses the
first element. Also, destroying an input/output variable halfway through
the function and then overwriting it on success is not clear. It's
better to use a local variable and the kernel macros to step through
each bit set in a bitmask and clearly show where outputs are set.
