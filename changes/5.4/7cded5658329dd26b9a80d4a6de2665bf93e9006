iwlwifi: pcie: fix merge damage on making QnJ exclusive

Two patches were sent out of order: one removed some conditions from
an if and the other moved the code elsewhere.  When sending the patch
that moved the code, an older version of the original code was moved,
causing the "make QnJ exclusive" code to be essentially undone.

Fix that by removing the inclusive conditions from the check again.
