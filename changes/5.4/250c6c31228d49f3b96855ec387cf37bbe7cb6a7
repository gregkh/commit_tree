Documentation/powerpc: Ultravisor API

Protected Execution Facility (PEF) is an architectural change for
POWER 9 that enables Secure Virtual Machines (SVMs). When enabled,
PEF adds a new higher privileged mode, called Ultravisor mode, to POWER
architecture. Along with the new mode there is new firmware called the
Protected Execution Ultravisor (or Ultravisor for short).

POWER 9 DD2.3 chips (PVR=0x004e1203) or greater will be PEF-capable.

Attached documentation provides an overview of PEF and defines the API
for various interfaces that must be implemented in the Ultravisor
firmware as well as in the KVM Hypervisor.
