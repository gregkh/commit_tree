perf/x86: Make more stuff static

When building with C=2, sparse makes note of a number of things:

  arch/x86/events/intel/rapl.c:637:30: warning: symbol 'rapl_attr_update' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/x86/events/intel/cstate.c:449:30: warning: symbol 'core_attr_update' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/x86/events/intel/cstate.c:457:30: warning: symbol 'pkg_attr_update' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/x86/events/msr.c:170:30: warning: symbol 'attr_update' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/x86/events/intel/lbr.c:276:1: warning: symbol 'lbr_from_quirk_key' was not declared. Should it be static?

And they can all indeed be static.
