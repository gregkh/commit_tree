ASoC: SOF: fix HDA direct MMIO access

The recent change to remove the bus->io_ops callbacks used an older
version of the SOF code base, and when merged into Mark's for-next it
invalidated changes, resulting in broken compilation identified by
kbuild and reproduced during the weekly SOF rebase.

Restore SOF code overridden by git merge and apply Takashi's intended
change in the 'right' location.
