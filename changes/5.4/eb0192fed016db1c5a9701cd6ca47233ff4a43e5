drm/i915: Fix g4x sprite scaling stride check with GTT remapping

I forgot to update the g4x sprite scaling stride check when GTT
remapping was introduced. The stride of the original framebuffer
is irrelevant when remapping is used and instead we want to check
the stride of the remapped view.

Also drop the duplicate width_bytes check. We already check that
a few lines earlier.
