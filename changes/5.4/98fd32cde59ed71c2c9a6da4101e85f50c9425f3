powernv/eeh: Use generic code to handle hot resets

When we reset PCI devices managed by a hotplug driver the reset may
generate spurious hotplug events that cause the PCI device we're resetting
to be torn down accidently. This is a problem for EEH (when the driver is
EEH aware) since we want to leave the OS PCI device state intact so that
the device can be re-set without losing any resources (network, disks,
etc) provided by the driver.

Generic PCI code provides the pci_bus_error_reset() function to handle
resetting a PCI Device (or bus) by using the reset method provided by the
hotplug slot driver. We can use this function if the EEH core has
requested a hot reset (common case) without tripping over the hotplug
driver.
