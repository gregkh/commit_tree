objtool: Ignore intentional differences for the x86 insn decoder

Since we need to build this in !x86, we need to explicitely use the x86
files, not things like asm/insn.h, so we intentionally differ from the
master copy in the kernel sources, add -I diff directives to ignore just
these differences when checking for drift.
