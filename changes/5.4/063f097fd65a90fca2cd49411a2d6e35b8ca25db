intel_th: msu: Fix missing allocation failure check on a kstrndup

Commit 615c164da0eb ("intel_th: msu: Introduce buffer interface") forgot
to add a NULL pointer check for the value returned from kstrdup(), which
will be troublesome if the allocation fails.

Fix that by adding the check.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference null return")
Fixes: 615c164da0eb ("intel_th: msu: Introduce buffer interface")
