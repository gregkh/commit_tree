net: spider_net: Use struct_size() helper

One of the more common cases of allocation size calculations is finding
the size of a structure that has a zero-sized array at the end, along
with memory for some number of elements for that array. For example:

struct spider_net_card {
	...
        struct spider_net_descr darray[0];
};

Make use of the struct_size() helper instead of an open-coded version
in order to avoid any potential type mistakes.

So, replace the following form:

sizeof(struct spider_net_card) + (tx_descriptors + rx_descriptors) * sizeof(struct spider_net_descr)

with:

struct_size(card, darray, tx_descriptors + rx_descriptors)

Notice that, in this case, variable alloc_size is not necessary, hence it
is removed.
