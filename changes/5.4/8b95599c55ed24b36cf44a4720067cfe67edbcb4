net: phy: micrel: Discern KSZ8051 and KSZ8795 PHYs

The KSZ8051 PHY and the KSZ8794/KSZ8795/KSZ8765 switch share exactly the
same PHY ID. Since KSZ8051 is higher in the ksphy_driver[] list of PHYs
in the micrel PHY driver, it is used even with the KSZ87xx switch. This
is wrong, since the KSZ8051 configures registers of the PHY which are
not present on the simplified KSZ87xx switch PHYs and misconfigures
other registers of the KSZ87xx switch PHYs.

Fortunatelly, it is possible to tell apart the KSZ8051 PHY from the
KSZ87xx switch by checking the Basic Status register Bit 0, which is
read-only and indicates presence of the Extended Capability Registers.
The KSZ8051 PHY has those registers while the KSZ87xx switch does not.

This patch implements simple check for the presence of this bit for
both the KSZ8051 PHY and KSZ87xx switch, to let both use the correct
PHY driver instance.
