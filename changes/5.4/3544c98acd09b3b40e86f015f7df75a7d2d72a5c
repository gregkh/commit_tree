net/tls: narrow down the critical area of device_offload_lock

On setsockopt path we need to hold device_offload_lock from
the moment we check netdev is up until the context is fully
ready to be added to the tls_device_list.

No need to hold it around the get_netdev_for_sock().
Change the code and remove the confusing comment.
