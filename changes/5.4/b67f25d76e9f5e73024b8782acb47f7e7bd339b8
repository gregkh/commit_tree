ice: Remove flag to track VF interrupt status

As a result of refactoring of VF VSIs interrupts code, there is no
need to track its configuration status again with ICE_VF_STATE_CFG_INTR
flag - In fact, it is not being checked anywhere in the code right now, so
this patch removes the dead code as applicable to the flag.
