KVM: VMX: Fix and tweak the comments for VM-Enter

Fix an incorrect/stale comment regarding the vmx_vcpu pointer, as guest
registers are now loaded using a direct pointer to the start of the
register array.

Opportunistically add a comment to document why the vmx_vcpu pointer is
needed, its consumption via 'call vmx_update_host_rsp' is rather subtle.
