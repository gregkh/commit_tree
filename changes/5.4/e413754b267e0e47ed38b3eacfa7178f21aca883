fuse: add nocreds to fuse_args

In some cases it makes no sense to set pid/uid/gid fields in the request
header.  Allow fuse_simple_background() to omit these.  This is only
required in the "force" case, so for now just WARN if set otherwise.

Fold fuse_get_req_nofail_nopages() into its only caller.  Comment is
obsolete anyway.
