net/smc: receive returns without data

smc_cdc_rxed_any_close_or_senddone() is used as an end condition for the
receive loop. This conflicts with smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() which could
run in parallel and set the bits checked by
smc_cdc_rxed_any_close_or_senddone() before the receive is processed.
In that case we could return from receive with no data, although data is
available. The same applies to smc_rx_wait().
Fix this by checking for RCV_SHUTDOWN only, which is set in
smc_cdc_msg_recv_action() after the receive was actually processed.
