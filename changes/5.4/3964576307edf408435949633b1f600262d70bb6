can: mcp251x: Use dev_name() during request_threaded_irq()

Passing driver name as name during request_threaded_irq() results in all
CAN IRQs have same name. This does not help much to easily identify which
IRQ belongs to which CAN instance. Therefore pass dev_name() during
request_threaded_irq() so that better identifiable name is listed for
CAN devices in cat /proc/interrupts output.
