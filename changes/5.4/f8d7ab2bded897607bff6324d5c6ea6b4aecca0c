tracing/probe: Fix same probe event argument matching

Commit fe60b0ce8e73 ("tracing/probe: Reject exactly same probe event")
tries to reject a event which matches an already existing probe.

However it currently continues to match arguments and rejects adding a
probe even when the arguments don't match. Fix this by only rejecting a
probe if and only if all the arguments match.
