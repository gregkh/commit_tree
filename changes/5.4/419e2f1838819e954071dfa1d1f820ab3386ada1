dma-mapping: remove arch_dma_mmap_pgprot

arch_dma_mmap_pgprot is used for two things:

 1) to override the "normal" uncached page attributes for mapping
    memory coherent to devices that can't snoop the CPU caches
 2) to provide the special DMA_ATTR_WRITE_COMBINE semantics on older
    arm systems and some mips platforms

Replace one with the pgprot_dmacoherent macro that is already provided
by arm and much simpler to use, and lift the DMA_ATTR_WRITE_COMBINE
handling to common code with an explicit arch opt-in.
