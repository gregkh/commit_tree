can: ti_hecc: keep MIM and MD set

The HECC_CANMIM is set in the xmit path and cleared in the interrupt.
Since this is done with a read, modify, write action the register might
end up with some more MIM enabled then intended, since it is not
protected. That doesn't matter at all, since the tx interrupt disables
the mailbox with HECC_CANME (while holding a spinlock). So lets just
always keep MIM set.

While at it, since the mailbox direction never changes, don't set it
every time a message is send, ti_hecc_reset() already sets them to tx.
