ipv4: fix IPSKB_FRAG_PMTU handling with fragmentation

This patch removes the iph field from the state structure, which is not
properly initialized. Instead, add a new field to make the "do we want
to set DF" be the state bit and move the code to set the DF flag from
ip_frag_next().

Joint work with Pablo and Linus.
