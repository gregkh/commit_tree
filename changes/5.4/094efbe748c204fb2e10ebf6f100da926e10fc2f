media: ti-vpe: fix leaked of_node references

The call to of_get_parent returns a node pointer with refcount
incremented thus it must be explicitly decremented after the last
usage.

Detected by coccinelle with the following warnings:
drivers/media/platform/ti-vpe/cal.c:1621:1-7: ERROR: missing of_node_put; acquired a node pointer with refcount incremented on line 1607, but without a corresponding object release within this function.
