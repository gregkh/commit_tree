bnxt_en: Add TPA ID mapping logic for 57500 chips.

The new TPA feature on 57500 supports a larger number of concurrent TPAs
(up to 1024) divided among the functions.  We need to add some logic to
map the hardware TPA ID to a software index that keeps track of each TPA
in progress.  A 1:1 direct mapping without translation would be too
wasteful as we would have to allocate 1024 TPA structures for each RX
ring on each PCI function.
