net: phy: swphy: emulate register MII_ESTATUS

When the genphy driver binds to a swphy it will call
genphy_read_abilites that will try to read MII_ESTATUS if BMSR_ESTATEN
is set in MII_BMSR. So far this would read the default value 0xffff
and 1000FD and 1000HD are reported as supported just by chance.
Better add explicit support for emulating MII_ESTATUS.
