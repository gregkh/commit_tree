ASoC: soc-core: add NOTE to snd_soc_rtdcom_lookup()

We can find specified name component via snd_soc_rtdcom_lookup().
But, it is not enough under multi CPU/Codec/Platform, because many
components which have same driver name might be connected to same rtd.

Not using this function as much as possible is best solution,
but some drivers are already deeply depended to it.

We can expand this function, for example having "num" which specifies
found order at parameter, etc (In such case, it need to have fixed
probing order).
Or, use different driver name in such component, etc.

We will have such issue if multi CPU/Codec/Platform were supported.
To indicate it, this patch adds NOTE to this function.
