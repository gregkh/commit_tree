powerpc/opalcore: export /sys/firmware/opal/core for analysing opal crashes

Export /sys/firmware/opal/core file to analyze opal crashes. Since OPAL
core can be generated independent of CONFIG_FA_DUMP support in kernel,
add this support under a new kernel config option CONFIG_OPAL_CORE.
Also, avoid code duplication by moving common code used while exporting
/proc/vmcore and/or /sys/firmware/opal/core file(s).
