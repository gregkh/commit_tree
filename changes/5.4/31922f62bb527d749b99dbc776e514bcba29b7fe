iio: adc: stm32-adc: move registers definitions

Move STM32 ADC registers definitions to common header.
This is precursor patch to:
- iio: adc: stm32-adc: fix a race when using several adcs with dma and irq

It keeps registers definitions as a whole block, to ease readability and
allow simple access path to EOC bits (readl) in stm32-adc-core driver.

Fixes: 2763ea0585c9 ("iio: adc: stm32: add optional dma support")
