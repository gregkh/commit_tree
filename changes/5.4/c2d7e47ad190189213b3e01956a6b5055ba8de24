drm: panel-lvds: Spout an error if of_get_display_timing() gives an error

In the patch ("video: of: display_timing: Don't yell if no timing node
is present") we'll stop spouting an error directly in
of_get_display_timing() if no node is present.  Presumably panel-lvds
should take charge of spouting its own error now.

NOTE: we'll print two errors if the node was present but there were
problems parsing the timing node (one in of_parse_display_timing() and
this new one).  Since this is a fatal error for the driver's probe
(and presumably someone will be debugging), this should be OK.
