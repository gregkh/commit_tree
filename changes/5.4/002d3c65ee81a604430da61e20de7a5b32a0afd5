MAINTAINERS: update Cavium ThunderX2 maintainers

jnair is no longer at caviumnetworks.com (or at marvell.com). This also
means that Cavium ThunderX2 will now be maintained by Robert.

This is probably a good time to map various email addresses used for
my patches to my personal email ID, update .mailmap to do this.
