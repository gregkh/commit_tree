drop_monitor: Add support for packet alert mode for hardware drops

In a similar fashion to software drops, extend drop monitor to send
netlink events when packets are dropped by the underlying hardware.

The main difference is that instead of encoding the program counter (PC)
from which kfree_skb() was called in the netlink message, we encode the
hardware trap name. The two are mostly equivalent since they should both
help the user understand why the packet was dropped.
