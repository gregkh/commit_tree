USB: usblcd: fix I/O after disconnect

Make sure to stop all I/O on disconnect by adding a disconnected flag
which is used to prevent new I/O from being started and by stopping all
ongoing I/O before returning.

This also fixes a potential use-after-free on driver unbind in case the
driver data is freed before the completion handler has run.
