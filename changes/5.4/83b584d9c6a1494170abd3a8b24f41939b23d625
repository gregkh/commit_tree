x86/paravirt: Drop {read,write}_cr8() hooks

There is a lot of infrastructure for functionality which is used
exclusively in __{save,restore}_processor_state() on the suspend/resume
path.

cr8 is an alias of APIC_TASKPRI, and APIC_TASKPRI is saved/restored by
lapic_{suspend,resume}().  Saving and restoring cr8 independently of the
rest of the Local APIC state isn't a clever thing to be doing.

Delete the suspend/resume cr8 handling, which shrinks the size of struct
saved_context, and allows for the removal of both PVOPS.
