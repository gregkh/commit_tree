cfg80211: initialize on-stack chandefs

In a few places we don't properly initialize on-stack chandefs,
resulting in EDMG data to be non-zero, which broke things.

Additionally, in a few places we rely on the driver to init the
data completely, but perhaps we shouldn't as non-EDMG drivers
may not initialize the EDMG data, also initialize it there.
