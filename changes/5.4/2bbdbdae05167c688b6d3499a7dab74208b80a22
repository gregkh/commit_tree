posix-cpu-timers: Get rid of zero checks

Deactivation of the expiry cache is done by setting all clock caches to
0. That requires to have a check for zero in all places which update the
expiry cache:

	if (cache == 0 || new < cache)
		cache = new;

Use U64_MAX as the deactivated value, which allows to remove the zero
checks when updating the cache and reduces it to the obvious check:

	if (new < cache)
		cache = new;

This also removes the weird workaround in do_prlimit() which was required
to convert a RLIMIT_CPU value of 0 (immediate expiry) to 1 because handing
in 0 to the posix CPU timer code would have effectively disarmed it.
