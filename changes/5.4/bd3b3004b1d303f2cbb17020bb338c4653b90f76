drm/i915/tgl: Report valid VDBoxes with SFC capability

In Gen11, only even numbered "logical" VDBoxes are hooked up to a SFC
(Scaler & Format Converter) unit. This is not the case in Tigerlake,
where each VDBox can access a SFC.

We will use this information to decide when the SFC units need to be reset
and also pass it to the GuC.
