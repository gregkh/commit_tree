drm/vbox: Remove empty PRIME functions

The vbox driver uses VRAM helpers for memory management. These helpers
provide a basic implementation of PRIME functions, so the vbox driver's
empty implmentation can be removed. As a side effect of this change,
vbox can now use generic framebuffer emulation.
