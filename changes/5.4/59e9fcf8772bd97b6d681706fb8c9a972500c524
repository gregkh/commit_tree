of: restore old handling of cells_name=NULL in of_*_phandle_with_args()

Before commit e42ee61017f5 ("of: Let of_for_each_phandle fallback to
non-negative cell_count") the iterator functions calling
of_for_each_phandle assumed a cell count of 0 if cells_name was NULL.
This corner case was missed when implementing the fallback logic in
e42ee61017f5 and resulted in an endless loop.

Restore the old behaviour of of_count_phandle_with_args() and
of_parse_phandle_with_args() and add a check to
of_phandle_iterator_init() to prevent a similar failure as a safety
precaution. of_parse_phandle_with_args_map() doesn't need a similar fix
as cells_name isn't NULL there.
