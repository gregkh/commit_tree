KVM: vmx: Introduce handle_unexpected_vmexit and handle WAITPKG vmexit

As the latest Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's
Manual, UMWAIT and TPAUSE instructions cause a VM exit if the
RDTSC exiting and enable user wait and pause VM-execution
controls are both 1.

Because KVM never enable RDTSC exiting, the vm-exit for UMWAIT and TPAUSE
should never happen. Considering EXIT_REASON_XSAVES and
EXIT_REASON_XRSTORS is also unexpected VM-exit for KVM. Introduce a common
exit helper handle_unexpected_vmexit() to handle these unexpected VM-exit.
