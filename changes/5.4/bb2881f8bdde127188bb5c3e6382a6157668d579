drm/i915/uc: introduce intel_uc_fw_supported

Instead of always checking in the device config is GuC and HuC are
supported or not, we can save the state in the uc_fw structure and
avoid going through i915 every time from the low-level uc management
code. while at it FIRMWARE_NONE has been renamed to better indicate that
we haven't started the fetch/load yet, but we might have already selected
a blob.
