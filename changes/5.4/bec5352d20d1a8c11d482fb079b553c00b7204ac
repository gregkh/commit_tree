media: i2c: et8ek8: Convert to new i2c device probe()

The I2C core framework provides a simplified probe framework from commit
b8a1a4cd5a98 ("i2c: Provide a temporary .probe_new() call-back type").

This driver does not utilise the i2c_device_id table in the probe, so we can
easily convert it to utilise the simplified i2c driver registration.
