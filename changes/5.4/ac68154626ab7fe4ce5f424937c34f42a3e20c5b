tracing: Add "gfp_t" support in synthetic_events

Add "gfp_t" support in synthetic_events, then the "gfp_t" type
parameter in some functions can be traced.

Prints the gfp flags as hex in addition to the human-readable flag
string.  Example output:

  whoopsie-630 [000] ...1 78.969452: testevent: bar=b20 (GFP_ATOMIC|__GFP_ZERO)
    rcuc/0-11  [000] ...1 81.097555: testevent: bar=a20 (GFP_ATOMIC)
    rcuc/0-11  [000] ...1 81.583123: testevent: bar=a20 (GFP_ATOMIC)
