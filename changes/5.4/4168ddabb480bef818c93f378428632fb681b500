ASoC: soc-core: use device_register()

It is easy to read code if it is cleanly using paired function/naming,
like start <-> stop, register <-> unregister, etc, etc.
But, current ALSA SoC code is very random, unbalance, not paired, etc.

soc-core.c is using device_unregiser(), but there is no its paired
device_regiser(). We can find its code at soc_post_component_init()
which is using device_initialize() and device_add().
Here, device_initialize() + device_add() = device_register().

	-- linux/drivers/base/core.c --
	int device_register(struct device *dev)
	{
		device_initialize(dev);
		return device_add(dev);
	}

device_initialize() is doing each dev member's initialization only,
not related to device parent/release/groups.
Thus, we can postpone it.
let's use device_register() instead of device_initialize()/device_add().
