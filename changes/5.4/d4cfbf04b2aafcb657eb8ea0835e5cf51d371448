smb3: Fix regression in time handling

Fixes: cb7a69e60590 ("cifs: Initialize filesystem timestamp ranges")

Only very old servers (e.g. OS/2 and DOS) did not support
DCE TIME (100 nanosecond granularity).  Fix the checks used
to set minimum and maximum times.

Fixes xfstest generic/258 (on 5.4-rc1 and later)
