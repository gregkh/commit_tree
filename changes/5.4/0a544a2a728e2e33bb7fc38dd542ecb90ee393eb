drm/i915: Fixup preempt-to-busy vs resubmission of a virtual request

As preempt-to-busy leaves the request on the HW as the resubmission is
processed, that request may complete in the background and even cause a
second virtual request to enter queue. This second virtual request
breaks our "single request in the virtual pipeline" assumptions.
Furthermore, as the virtual request may be completed and retired, we
lose the reference the virtual engine assumes is held. Normally, just
removing the request from the scheduler queue removes it from the
engine, but the virtual engine keeps track of its singleton request via
its ve->request. This pointer needs protecting with a reference.

v2: Drop unnecessary motion of rq->engine = owner
