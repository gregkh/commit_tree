PCI: tegra: Add support to enable slot regulators

Add support to get regulator information of 3.3V and 12V supplies of a PCIe
slot from the respective controller's device-tree node and enable those
supplies. This is required in platforms like p2972-0000 where the supplies
to x16 slot owned by C5 controller need to be enabled before attempting to
enumerate the devices.
