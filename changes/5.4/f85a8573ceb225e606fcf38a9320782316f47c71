x86/syscalls: Disallow compat entries for all types of 64-bit syscalls

A "compat" entry in the syscall tables means to use a different entry on
32-bit and 64-bit builds.

This only makes sense for syscalls that exist in the first place in 32-bit
builds, so disallow it for anything other than i386.
