mm: thp: extract split_queue_* into a struct

Patch series "Make deferred split shrinker memcg aware", v6.

Currently THP deferred split shrinker is not memcg aware, this may cause
premature OOM with some configuration.  For example the below test would
run into premature OOM easily:

$ cgcreate -g memory:thp
$ echo 4G > /sys/fs/cgroup/memory/thp/memory/limit_in_bytes
$ cgexec -g memory:thp transhuge-stress 4000

transhuge-stress comes from kernel selftest.

It is easy to hit OOM, but there are still a lot THP on the deferred split
queue, memcg direct reclaim can't touch them since the deferred split
shrinker is not memcg aware.

Convert deferred split shrinker memcg aware by introducing per memcg
deferred split queue.  The THP should be on either per node or per memcg
deferred split queue if it belongs to a memcg.  When the page is
immigrated to the other memcg, it will be immigrated to the target memcg's
deferred split queue too.

Reuse the second tail page's deferred_list for per memcg list since the
same THP can't be on multiple deferred split queues.

Make deferred split shrinker not depend on memcg kmem since it is not
slab.  It doesn't make sense to not shrink THP even though memcg kmem is
disabled.

With the above change the test demonstrated above doesn't trigger OOM even
though with cgroup.memory=nokmem.

This patch (of 4):

Put split_queue, split_queue_lock and split_queue_len into a struct in
order to reduce code duplication when we convert deferred_split to memcg
aware in the later patches.
