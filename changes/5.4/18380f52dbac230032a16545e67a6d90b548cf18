platform/x86: classmate-laptop: remove unused variable

Fixes gcc '-Wunused-but-set-variable' warning:

drivers/platform/x86/classmate-laptop.c: In function cmpc_accel_remove_v4:
drivers/platform/x86/classmate-laptop.c:424:21: warning: variable accel
set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
drivers/platform/x86/classmate-laptop.c: In function cmpc_accel_remove:
drivers/platform/x86/classmate-laptop.c:660:21: warning: variable accel
set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]

In function cmpc_accel_remove_v4 and cmpc_accel_remove, variable accel is
set but not used, so it can be removed. In that case, variable inputdev is
set but not used and can be removed.
