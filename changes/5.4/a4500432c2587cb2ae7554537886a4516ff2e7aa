libbpf: add support for need_wakeup flag in AF_XDP part

This commit adds support for the new need_wakeup flag in AF_XDP. The
xsk_socket__create function is updated to handle this and a new
function is introduced called xsk_ring_prod__needs_wakeup(). This
function can be used by the application to check if Rx and/or Tx
processing needs to be explicitly woken up.
