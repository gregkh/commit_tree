ice: Account for all states of FW DCBx and LLDP

Currently, only the DCBx status is taken into account to
determine if FW LLDP is possible.  But there are NVM version
coming out with DCBx enabled, and FW LLDP disabled.  This
is causing errors where the driver sees that DCBx is not
disabled, and then tries to register for LLDP MIB change
events, and fails.

Change the logic to detect both DCBx and LLDP states in the
FW engine.
