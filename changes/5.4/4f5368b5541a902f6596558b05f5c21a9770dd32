drm/kms: Catch mode_object lifetime errors

Only dynamic mode objects, i.e. those which are refcounted and have a free
callback, can be added while the overall drm_device is visible to
userspace. All others must be added before drm_dev_register and
removed after drm_dev_unregister.

Small issue around drivers still using the load/unload callbacks, we
need to make sure we set dev->registered so that load/unload code in
these callbacks doesn't trigger false warnings. Only a small
adjustement in drm_dev_register was needed.

Motivated by some irc discussions about object ids of dynamic objects
like blobs become invalid, and me going on a bit an audit spree.
