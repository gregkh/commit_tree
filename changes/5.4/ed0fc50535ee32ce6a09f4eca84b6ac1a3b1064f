habanalabs: cap simulator timeout

In the driver timeout functions, we give the simulator a factor of 10
in the timeout. This was necessary when the requested timeout is small
but if it was a few seconds, this can result in a very large timeout which
is unnecessary.

This patch caps the maximum timeout of the simulator to 10 seconds, which
is our largest timeout in the code. That is more then enough for anything
the simulator is doing.
