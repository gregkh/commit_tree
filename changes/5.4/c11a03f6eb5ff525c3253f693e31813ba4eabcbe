drm: kirin: Move kirin_crtc, kirin_plane, kirin_format to kirin_drm_drv.h

As part of refactoring the kirin driver to better support
different hardware revisions, this patch moves some shared
structures and helpers to the common kirin_drm_drv.h

These structures will later used by both kirin620 and
future kirin960 driver
