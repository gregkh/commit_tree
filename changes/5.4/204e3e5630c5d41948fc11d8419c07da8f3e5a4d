RDMA/odp: Check for overflow when computing the umem_odp end

Since the page size can be extended in the ODP case by IB_ACCESS_HUGETLB
the existing overflow checks done by ib_umem_get() are not
sufficient. Check for overflow again.

Further, remove the unchecked math from the inlines and just use the
precomputed value stored in the interval_tree_node.
