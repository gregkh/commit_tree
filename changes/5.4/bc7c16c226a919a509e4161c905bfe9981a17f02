ASoC: soc-core: move soc_probe_link_dais() next to soc_remove_link_dais()

It is easy to read code if it is cleanly using paired function/naming,
like start <-> stop, register <-> unregister, etc, etc.
But, current ALSA SoC code is very random, unbalance, not paired, etc.
It is easy to create bug at the such code, and it will be difficult to
debug.

This patch moves soc_probe_link_dais() next to soc_remove_link_dais()
which is paired function.
