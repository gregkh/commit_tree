drm/i915: Drop the fudge warning on ring restart for ctg/elk

Since we have already stopped the ring, cleared the ring, disabled the
ring (and verifying the ring is clear), a later debug message that the
ring is no longer clear serves no function. It appears it restarts
anyway, and we verify that the ring started correctly afterwards.
