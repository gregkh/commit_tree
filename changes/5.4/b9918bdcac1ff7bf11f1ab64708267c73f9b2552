Documentation/process: Add fallthrough pseudo-keyword

Describe the fallthrough pseudo-keyword.

Convert the coding-style.rst example to the keyword style.
Add description and links to deprecated.rst.

Miguel Ojeda comments on the eventual [[fallthrough]] syntax:
 "Note that C17/C18 does not have [[fallthrough]].

  C++17 introduced it, as it is mentioned above. I would keep the
  __attribute__((fallthrough)) -> [[fallthrough]] change you did,
  though, since that is indeed the standard syntax (given the paragraph
  references C++17).

  I was told by Aaron Ballman (who is proposing them for C) that it is
  more or less likely that it becomes standardized in C2x. However, it
  is still not added to the draft (other attributes are already,
  though). See N2268 and N2269:
