drm/i915: Make debugfs/per_file_stats scale better

Currently we walk the entire list of obj->vma for each obj within a file
to find the matching vma of this context. Since we know we are searching
for a particular vma bound to a user context, we can use the rbtree to
search for it rather than repeatedly walk everything.
