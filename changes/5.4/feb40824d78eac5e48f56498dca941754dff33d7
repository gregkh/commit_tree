mmc: sdhci-omap: Fix Tuning procedure for temperatures < -20C

According to the App note[1] detailing the tuning algorithm, for
temperatures < -20C, the initial tuning value should be min(largest value
in LPW - 24, ceil(13/16 ratio of LPW)). The largest value in LPW is
(max_window + 4 * (max_len - 1)) and not (max_window + 4 * max_len) itself.
Fix this implementation.
