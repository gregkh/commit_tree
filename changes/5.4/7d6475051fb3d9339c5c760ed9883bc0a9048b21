powerpc/powernv: Fix CPU idle to be called with IRQs disabled

Commit e78a7614f3876 ("idle: Prevent late-arriving interrupts from
disrupting offline") changes arch_cpu_idle_dead to be called with
interrupts disabled, which triggers the WARN in pnv_smp_cpu_kill_self.

Fix this by fixing up irq_happened after hard disabling, rather than
requiring there are no pending interrupts, similarly to what was done
done until commit 2525db04d1cc5 ("powerpc/powernv: Simplify lazy IRQ
handling in CPU offline").
