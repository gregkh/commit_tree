scsi: lpfc: Fix sg_seg_cnt for HBAs that don't support NVME

On an SLI-3 adapter which does not support NVMe, but with the driver global
attribute to enable nvme on any adapter if it does support NVMe
(e.g. module parameter lpfc_enable_fc4_type=3), the SGL and total SGE
values are being munged by the protocol enablement when it shouldn't be.

Correct by changing the location of where the NVME sgl information is being
applied, which will avoid any SLI-3-based adapter.
