media: dvb-frontends: fix memory leaks

In dib7000pc_detection(), 'tx' and 'rx' are allocated through kzalloc()
respectively. However, if DiB7000PC is detected, they are not deallocated,
leading to memory leaks. To fix this issue, create a label to free 'tx' and
'rx' before returning from the function.
