drm: kirin: Rename ade_crtc to kirin_crtc

As part of refactoring the kirin driver to better support
different hardware revisions, this patch renames the
struct ade_crtc to kirin_crtc.

The struct kirin_crtc will later used by both kirin620 and
future kirin960 driver, and will be moved to a common
kirin_drm_drv.h in a future patch
