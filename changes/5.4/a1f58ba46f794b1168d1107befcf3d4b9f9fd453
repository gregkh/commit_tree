io_uring: correct timeout req sequence when inserting a new entry

The sequence number of the timeout req (req->sequence) indicate the
expected completion request. Because of each timeout req consume a
sequence number, so the sequence of each timeout req on the timeout
list shouldn't be the same. But now, we may get the same number (also
incorrect) if we insert a new entry before the last one, such as submit
such two timeout reqs on a new ring instance below.

                    req->sequence
 req_1 (count = 2):       2
 req_2 (count = 1):       2

Then, if we submit a nop req, req_2 will still timeout even the nop req
finished. This patch fix this problem by adjust the sequence number of
each reordered reqs when inserting a new entry.
