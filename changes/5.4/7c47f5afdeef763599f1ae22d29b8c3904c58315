s390/qdio: enable drivers to poll for Output completions

While commit d36deae75011 ("qdio: extend API to allow polling") enhanced
the qdio layer so that drivers can poll their Input Queues, we don't
have the corresponding infrastructure for Output Queues yet.

Factor out a helper that scans a single QDIO Queue, so that qeth can
implement TX NAPI on top of it.
While doing so, remove the duplicated tracking of the next-to-scan index
(q->first_to_check vs q->first_to_kick) in this code path.

qdio_handle_aobs() needs to move slightly upwards in the code hierarchy,
so that it's still called from the polling path.
