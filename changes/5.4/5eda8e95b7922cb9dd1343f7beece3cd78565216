regulator: da9211: fix obtaining "enable" GPIO

This fixes 11da04af0d3b, as devm_gpiod_get_from_of_node() does
not do translation "con-id" -> "con-id-gpios" that our bindings expects,
and therefore it was wrong to change connection ID to be simply "enable"
when moving to using devm_gpiod_get_from_of_node().

Fixes: 11da04af0d3b ("regulator: da9211: Pass descriptors instead of GPIO numbers")
