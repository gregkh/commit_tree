cpuidle: teo: Get rid of redundant check in teo_update()

Notice that setting measured_us to UINT_MAX in teo_update() earlier
doesn't change the behavior of the following code, so do that and
eliminate a redundant check used for setting measured_us to UINT_MAX.

This change is not expected to alter functionality.
