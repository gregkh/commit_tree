team: fix nested locking lockdep warning

team interface could be nested and it's lock variable could be nested too.
But this lock uses static lockdep key and there is no nested locking
handling code such as mutex_lock_nested() and so on.
so the Lockdep would warn about the circular locking scenario that
couldn't happen.
In order to fix, this patch makes the team module to use dynamic lock key
instead of static key.

Test commands:
    ip link add team0 type team
    ip link add team1 type team
    ip link set team0 master team1
    ip link set team0 nomaster
    ip link set team1 master team0
    ip link set team1 nomaster

Splat that looks like:
