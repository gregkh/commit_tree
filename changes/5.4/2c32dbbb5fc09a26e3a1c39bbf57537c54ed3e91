mmc: core: Clarify that the ->ack_sdio_irq() callback is mandatory

For the MMC_CAP2_SDIO_IRQ_NOTHREAD case and when using sdio_signal_irq(),
the ->ack_sdio_irq() is already mandatory, which was not the case for those
host drivers that called sdio_run_irqs() directly.

As there are no longer any drivers calling sdio_run_irqs(), let's clarify
the code by dropping the unnecessary check and explicitly state that the
callback is mandatory in the header file.
