PM / devfreq: Fix kernel oops on governor module load

A bit unexpectedly (but still documented), request_module may
return a positive value, in case of a modprobe error.
This is currently causing issues in the devfreq framework.

When a request_module exits with a positive value, we currently
return that via ERR_PTR. However, because the value is positive,
it's not a ERR_VALUE proper, and is therefore treated as a
valid struct devfreq_governor pointer, leading to a kernel oops.

Fix this by returning -EINVAL if request_module returns a positive
value.
