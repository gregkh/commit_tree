drm/amdgpu: put the SMC into the proper state on reset/unload

When doing a GPU reset or unloading the driver, we need to
put the SMU into the apprpriate state for the re-init after
the reset or unload to reliably work.

I don't think this is necessary for BACO because the SMU actually
controls the BACO state to it needs to be active.

For suspend (S3), the asic is put into D3 so the SMU would be
powered down so I don't think we need to put the SMU into
any special state.
