null_blk: move duplicate code to callers

This is a preparation patch which moves the duplicate code for sectors
and nr_sectors calculations for bio vs request mode into their
respective callers (null_queue_bio(), null_qeueue_req()). Now the core
function only deals with the respective actions and commands instead of
having to calculte the bio vs req operations and different sector
related variables. We also move the flush command handling at the top
which significantly simplifies the rest of the code.
