arm64: mm: Introduce 52-bit Kernel VAs

Most of the machinery is now in place to enable 52-bit kernel VAs that
are detectable at boot time.

This patch adds a Kconfig option for 52-bit user and kernel addresses
and plumbs in the requisite CONFIG_ macros as well as sets TCR.T1SZ,
physvirt_offset and vmemmap at early boot.

To simplify things this patch also removes the 52-bit user/48-bit kernel
kconfig option.
