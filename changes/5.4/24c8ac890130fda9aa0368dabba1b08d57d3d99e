media: i2c: ov5640: Fix the order for enabling regulators

According to the OV5640 datasheet the following sequence needs to be
followed when powering the OV5640 supplies:

- DOVDD
- AVDD
- DVDD

So follow this order inside the ov5640_supply_name[] array, so that
the regulator_bulk() functions can enable the regulator in the
correct sequence.
