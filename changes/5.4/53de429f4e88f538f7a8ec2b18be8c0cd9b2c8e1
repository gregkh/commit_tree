net: hisilicon: Fix usage of uninitialized variable in function mdio_sc_cfg_reg_write()

In function mdio_sc_cfg_reg_write(), variable "reg_value" could be
uninitialized if regmap_read() fails. However, "reg_value" is used
to decide the control flow later in the if statement, which is
potentially unsafe.
