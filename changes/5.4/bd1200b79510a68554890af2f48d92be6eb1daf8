drop_monitor: Make timestamps y2038 safe

Timestamps are currently communicated to user space as 'struct
timespec', which is not considered y2038 safe since it uses a 32-bit
signed value for seconds.

Fix this while the API is still not part of any official kernel release
by using 64-bit nanoseconds timestamps instead.
