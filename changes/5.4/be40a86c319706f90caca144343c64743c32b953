s390/qeth: Fix initialization of vnicc cmd masks during set online

Without this patch, a command bit in the supported commands mask is only
ever set to unsupported during set online. If a command is ever marked as
unsupported (e.g. because of error during qeth_l2_vnicc_query_cmds),
subsequent successful initialization (offline/online) would not bring it
back.
