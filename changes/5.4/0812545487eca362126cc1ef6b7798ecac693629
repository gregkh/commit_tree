net: hns3: add interrupt affinity support for misc interrupt

The misc interrupt is used to schedule the reset and mailbox
subtask, and service_task delayed_work is used to do periodic
management work each second.

This patch sets the above three subtask's affinity using the
misc interrupt' affinity.

Also this patch setups a affinity notify for misc interrupt to
allow user to change the above three subtask's affinity.
