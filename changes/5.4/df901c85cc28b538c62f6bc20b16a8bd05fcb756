PCI: mobiveil: Fix the CPU base address setup in inbound window

Current code erroneously sets-up the CPU base address through the
parameter 'pci_addr', which is passed to initialize the CPU (AXI) base
address of the inbound window where the controller maps the PCI address
space into CPU physical address space; furthermore, it also truncates it
by programming only the lower 32-bit value into the inbound CPU address
register.

Fix both issues by introducing a new parameter 'u64 cpu_addr' to
initialize both lower 32-bit and upper 32-bit of the CPU physical
base address mapping PCI inbound transactions into CPU (AXI) ones.
