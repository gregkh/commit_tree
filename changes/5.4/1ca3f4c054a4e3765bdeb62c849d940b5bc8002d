xprtrdma: Combine rpcrdma_mr_put and rpcrdma_mr_unmap_and_put

Clean up. There is only one remaining rpcrdma_mr_put call site, and
it can be directly replaced with unmap_and_put because mr->mr_dir is
set to DMA_NONE just before the call.

Now all the call sites do a DMA unmap, and we can just rename
mr_unmap_and_put to mr_put, which nicely matches mr_get.
