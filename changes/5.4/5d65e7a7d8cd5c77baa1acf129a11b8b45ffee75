mm: untag user pointers in get_vaddr_frames

This patch is a part of a series that extends kernel ABI to allow to pass
tagged user pointers (with the top byte set to something else other than
0x00) as syscall arguments.

get_vaddr_frames uses provided user pointers for vma lookups, which can
only by done with untagged pointers.  Instead of locating and changing all
callers of this function, perform untagging in it.
