staging: rtl8188eu: fix HighestRate check in odm_ARFBRefresh_8188E()

It's incorrect to compare HighestRate with 0x0b twice in the following
manner "if (HighestRate > 0x0b) ... else if (HighestRate > 0x0b) ...". The
"else if" branch is constantly false. The second comparision should be
with 0x03 according to the max_rate_idx in ODM_RAInfo_Init().
