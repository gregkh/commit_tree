net: sched: extend flow_action_entry with destructor

Generalize flow_action_entry cleanup by extending the structure with
pointer to destructor function. Set the destructor in
tc_setup_flow_action(). Refactor tc_cleanup_flow_action() to call
entry->destructor() instead of using switch that dispatches by entry->id
and manually executes cleanup.

This refactoring is necessary for following patches in this series that
require destructor to use tc_action->ops callbacks that can't be easily
obtained in tc_cleanup_flow_action().
