ASoC: SOF: Intel: hda: Make hdac_device device-managed

snd_hdac_ext_bus_device_exit() has been recently modified
to no longer free the hdac device. SOF allocates memory for
hdac_device and hda_hda_priv with kzalloc. Make them
device-managed instead so that they will be freed when the
SOF driver is unloaded.

Because of the above change, hda_codec is device-managed and
it will be freed when the ASoC device is removed. Freeing
the codec in snd_hda_codec_dev_release() leads to kernel
panic while unloading and reloading the ASoC driver. So,
avoid freeing the hda_codec for ASoC driver. This is done in
the same patch to avoid bisect failure.
