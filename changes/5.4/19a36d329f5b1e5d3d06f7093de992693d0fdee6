KVM: VMX: Set VMENTER_L1D_FLUSH_NOT_REQUIRED if !X86_BUG_L1TF

The l1tf_vmx_mitigation is only set to VMENTER_L1D_FLUSH_NOT_REQUIRED
when the ARCH_CAPABILITIES MSR indicates that L1D flush is not required.
However, if the CPU is not affected by L1TF, l1tf_vmx_mitigation will
still be set to VMENTER_L1D_FLUSH_AUTO. This is certainly not the best
option for a !X86_BUG_L1TF CPU.

So force l1tf_vmx_mitigation to VMENTER_L1D_FLUSH_NOT_REQUIRED to make it
more explicit in case users are checking the vmentry_l1d_flush parameter.
