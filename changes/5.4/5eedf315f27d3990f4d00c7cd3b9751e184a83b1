crypto: arm/aes-ce - provide a synchronous version of ctr(aes)

AES in CTR mode is used by modes such as GCM and CCM, which are often
used in contexts where only synchronous ciphers are permitted. So
provide a synchronous version of ctr(aes) based on the existing code.
This requires a non-SIMD fallback to deal with invocations occurring
from a context where SIMD instructions may not be used. We have a
helper for this now in the AES library, so wire that up.
