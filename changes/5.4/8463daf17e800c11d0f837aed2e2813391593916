net/mlx5: Add support to use SMFS in switchdev mode

In case that flow steering mode of the driver is SMFS (Software Managed
Flow Steering), then use the DR (SW steering) API to create the steering

In addition, add a call to the set peer namespace when switchdev gets
devcom pair event. It is required to support VF LAG in SMFS.
