scsi: mpt3sas: Enumerate SES of a managed PCIe switch

SES device of managed PCIe switch will be enumerated same as NVMe drives.

The device info type for this SES device is

        MPI26_PCIE_DEVINFO_SCSI (0x4),

whereas the device info type for NVMe drives is

        MPI26_PCIE_DEVINFO_NVME (0x3).

Based on this device info type driver determines whether the device is NVMe
drive or a SES device of a managed PCIe switch.

This SES device doesn't have the PCIe device page 2 information like NVMe
drives, so driver won't read PCIe device page 2 information for SES device.

This SES device uses only IEEE SGL's, So driver build's IEEE SGL's whenever
it receives any SCSI commands for this SES device.
