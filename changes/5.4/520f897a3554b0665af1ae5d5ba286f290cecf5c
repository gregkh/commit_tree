ext4: use percpu_counters for extent_status cache hits/misses

@es_stats_cache_hits and @es_stats_cache_misses are accessed frequently in
ext4_es_lookup_extent function, it would influence the ext4 read/write
performance in NUMA system. Let's optimize it using percpu_counter,
it is profitable for the performance.

The test command is as below:
fio -name=randwrite -numjobs=8 -filename=/mnt/test1 -rw=randwrite
-ioengine=libaio -direct=1 -iodepth=64 -sync=0 -norandommap
-group_reporting -runtime=120 -time_based -bs=4k -size=5G

And the result is better 10% than the initial implement:
without the patchï¼ŒIOPS=197k, BW=770MiB/s (808MB/s)(90.3GiB/120002msec)
with the patch,  IOPS=218k, BW=852MiB/s (894MB/s)(99.9GiB/120002msec)
