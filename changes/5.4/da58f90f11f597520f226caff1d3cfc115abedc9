netdevsim: Add devlink-trap support

Have netdevsim register its trap groups and traps with devlink during
initialization and periodically report trapped packets to devlink core.

Since netdevsim is not a real device, the trapped packets are emulated
using a workqueue that periodically reports a UDP packet with a random
5-tuple from each active packet trap and from each running netdev.
