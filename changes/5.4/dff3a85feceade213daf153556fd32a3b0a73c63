sched_setattr: switch to copy_struct_from_user()

Switch sched_setattr() syscall from it's own copying struct sched_attr
from userspace to the new dedicated copy_struct_from_user() helper.

The change is very straightforward, and helps unify the syscall
interface for struct-from-userspace syscalls. Ideally we could also
unify sched_getattr(2)-style syscalls as well, but unfortunately the
correct semantics for such syscalls are much less clear (see [1] for
more detail). In future we could come up with a more sane idea for how
the syscall interface should look.

     robustify sched_read_attr() ABI logic and code")
