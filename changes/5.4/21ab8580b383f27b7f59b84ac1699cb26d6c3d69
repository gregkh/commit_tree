LSM: SafeSetID: Stop releasing uninitialized ruleset

The first time a rule set is configured for SafeSetID, we shouldn't be
trying to release the previously configured ruleset, since there isn't
one. Currently, the pointer that would point to a previously configured
ruleset is uninitialized on first rule set configuration, leading to a
crash when we try to call release_ruleset with that pointer.
