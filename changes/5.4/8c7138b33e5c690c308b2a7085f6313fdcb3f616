net: Unpublish sk from sk_reuseport_cb before call_rcu

The "reuse->sock[]" array is shared by multiple sockets.  The going away
sk must unpublish itself from "reuse->sock[]" before making call_rcu()
call.  However, this unpublish-action is currently done after a grace
period and it may cause use-after-free.

The fix is to move reuseport_detach_sock() to sk_destruct().
Due to the above reason, any socket with sk_reuseport_cb has
to go through the rcu grace period before freeing it.

It is a rather old bug (~3 yrs).  The Fixes tag is not necessary
the right commit but it is the one that introduced the SOCK_RCU_FREE
logic and this fix is depending on it.
