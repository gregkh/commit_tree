perf tools: Move event synthesizing routines to separate header

Those are the only routines using the perf_event__handler_t typedef and
are all related, so move to a separate header to reduce the header
dependency tree, lots of places were getting event.h and even stdio.h,
limits.h indirectly, so fix those as well.
