ASoC: bcm: cygnus-pcm: Unneeded variable: "ret".

This patch fixes below issues reported by coccicheck

sound/soc/bcm/cygnus-pcm.c:642:5-8: Unneeded variable: "ret". Return "0"
on line 650
sound/soc/bcm/cygnus-pcm.c:671:5-8: Unneeded variable: "ret". Return "0"
on line 696

We cannot change return type of these functions as they are callback
functions of snd_pcm_ops
