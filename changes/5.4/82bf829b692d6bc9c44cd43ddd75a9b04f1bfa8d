Documentation: sphinx: Don't parse socket() as identifier reference

With the introduction of Documentation/sphinx/automarkup.py, socket() is
parsed as a reference to the in-kernel definition of socket. Sphinx then
decides that struct socket is a good match, which is usually not
intended, when the syscall is meant instead. This was observed in
Documentation/networking/af_xdp.rst.

Prevent socket() from being misinterpreted by adding it to the Skipfuncs
list in automarkup.py.
