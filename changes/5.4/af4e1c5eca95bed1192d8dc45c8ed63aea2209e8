x86/amd_nb: Add PCI device IDs for family 17h, model 70h

The AMD Ryzen gen 3 processors came with a different PCI IDs for the
function 3 & 4 which are used to access the SMN interface. The root
PCI address however remained at the same address as the model 30h.

Adding the F3/F4 PCI IDs respectively to the misc and link ids appear
to be sufficient for k10temp, so let's add them and follow up on the
patch if other functions need more tweaking.

Vicki Pfau sent an identical patch after I checked that no-one had
written this patch. I would have been happy about dropping my patch but
unlike for his patch series, I had already Cc:ed the x86 people and
they already reviewed the changes. Since Vicki has not answered to
any email after his initial series, let's assume she is on vacation
and let's avoid duplication of reviews from the maintainers and merge
my series. To acknowledge Vicki's anteriority, I added her S-o-b to
the patch.

v2, suggested by Guenter Roeck and Brian Woods:
 - rename from 71h to 70h
