ice: Remove enable DCB when SW LLDP is activated

Remove code that enables DCB in initialization when SW LLDP is
activated. DCB flag is set or reset before in ice_init_pf_dcb
based on number of TCs. So there is not need to overwrite it.

Setting DCB without checking number of TCs can cause communication
problems with other cards. Host card sends packet with VLAN priority
tag, but client card doesn't strip this tag and ping doesn't work.
