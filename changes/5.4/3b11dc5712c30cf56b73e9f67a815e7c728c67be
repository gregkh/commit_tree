NFC: nxp-nci: Remove unused macro pr_fmt()

The macro had never been used.

The driver uses mostly the nfc_err(), which, with other macros in the family,
is backed by corresponding dev_err(). pr_fmt() is not used for dev_err()
macro. Moreover, there is no need to print the module name which is part of the
device instance name anyway.
