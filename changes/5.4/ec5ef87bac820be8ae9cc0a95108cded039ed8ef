rcu/nocb: Use build-time no-CBs check in rcu_do_batch()

Currently, rcu_do_batch() invokes rcu_segcblist_is_offloaded() each time
it needs to know whether the current CPU is a no-CBs CPU.  Given that it
is not possible to change the no-CBs status of a CPU after boot, and given
that it is not possible to even have no-CBs CPUs in CONFIG_RCU_NOCB_CPU=n
kernels, this per-callback invocation wastes CPU.  This commit therefore
created a const on-stack variable to allow this check to be done only
once per rcu_do_batch() invocation.
