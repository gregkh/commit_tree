Remove VirtualBox guest shared folders filesystem

This went into staging in rc7.  It turns out that was a mistake, and
apparently it wasn't even supposed to go there at all, but be introduced
as a regular filesystem.

We don't try to sneak in whole new filesystems this late in the rc, just
delete the whole thing, and it can be re-introduced as a proper patch
with proper acks from actual filesystem people instead of some odd
late-rc staging back-door.
