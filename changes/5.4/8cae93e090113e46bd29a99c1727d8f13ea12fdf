media: uapi: h264: Add the concept of start code

Stateless decoders have different expectations about the
start code that is prepended on H264 slices. Add a
menu control to express the supported start code types
(including no start code).

Drivers are allowed to support only one start code type,
but they can support both too.

Note that this is independent of the H264 decoding mode,
which specifies the granularity of the decoding operations.
Either in frame-based or slice-based mode, this new control
will allow to define the start code expected on H264 slices.
