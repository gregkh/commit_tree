usb: gadget: function: u_ether: Downgrade kerneldoc headers which to not make the mark

Kerneldoc expects all function arguments to be documented.  If any
are missed it will complain.  Downgrade one header with 3 missing
argument descriptions and one which makes no attempt.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/usb/gadget/function/u_ether.c:750: warning: Function parameter or member 'dev_addr' not described in 'gether_setup_name'
 drivers/usb/gadget/function/u_ether.c:750: warning: Function parameter or member 'host_addr' not described in 'gether_setup_name'
 drivers/usb/gadget/function/u_ether.c:750: warning: Function parameter or member 'qmult' not described in 'gether_setup_name'
 drivers/usb/gadget/function/u_ether.c:1022: warning: Function parameter or member 'dev' not described in 'gether_cleanup'
