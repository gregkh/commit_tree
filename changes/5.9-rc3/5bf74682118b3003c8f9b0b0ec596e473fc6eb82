Drivers: hv: vmbus: Remove the target_vp field from the vmbus_channel struct

The field is read only in __vmbus_open() and it is already stored twice
(after a call to hv_cpu_number_to_vp_number()) in target_cpu_store() and
init_vp_index(); there is no need to "cache" its value in the channel
data structure.
