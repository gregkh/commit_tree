bnxt_en: Remove PCIe non-counters from ethtool statistics

Remove PCIe non-counters display from ethtool statistics, as
they are not simple counters but register dump.  The next few
patches will add logic to detect counter roll-over and it won't
work with these PCIe non-counters.

There will be a follow up patch to get PCIe information via
ethtool register dump.
