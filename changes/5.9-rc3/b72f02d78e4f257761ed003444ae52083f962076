drm/i915/gt: Prevent timeslicing into unpreemptable requests

We have a I915_REQUEST_NOPREEMPT flag that we set when we must prevent
the HW from preempting during the course of this request. We need to
honour this flag and protect the HW even if we have a heartbeat request,
or other maximum priority barrier, pending. As such, restrict the
timeslicing check to avoid preempting into the topmost priority band,
leaving the unpreemptable requests in blissful peace running
uninterrupted on the HW.

v2: Set the I915_PRIORITY_BARRIER to be less than
I915_PRIORITY_UNPREEMPTABLE so that we never submit a request
(heartbeat or barrier) that can legitimately preempt the current
non-premptable request.
