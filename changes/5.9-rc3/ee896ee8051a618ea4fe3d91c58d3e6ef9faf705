tracing: Remove outdated comment in stack handling

This comment describes the behaviour before commit 2a820bf74918
("tracing: Use percpu stack trace buffer more intelligently").  Since
that commit, interrupts and NMIs do use the per-cpu stacks so the
comment is no longer correct.  Remove it.

(Note that the FTRACE_STACK_SIZE mentioned in the comment has never
existed, it probably should have said FTRACE_STACK_ENTRIES.)
