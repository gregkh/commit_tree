tracing: Move pipe reference to trace array instead of current_tracer

If a process has the trace_pipe open on a trace_array, the current tracer
for that trace array should not be changed. This was original enforced by a
global lock, but when instances were introduced, it was moved to the
current_trace. But this structure is shared by all instances, and a
trace_pipe is for a single instance. There's no reason that a process that
has trace_pipe open on one instance should prevent another instance from
changing its current tracer. Move the reference counter to the trace_array
instead.

This is marked as "Fixes" but is more of a clean up than a true fix.
Backport if you want, but its not critical.
