crc-t10dif: use fallback in initial state

Currently the crc-t10dif module starts out with the fallback disabled
and crct10dif_tfm == NULL.  crc_t10dif_mod_init() tries to allocate
crct10dif_tfm, and if it fails it enables the fallback.

This is backwards because it means that any call to crc_t10dif() prior
to module_init (which could theoretically happen from built-in code)
will crash rather than use the fallback as expected.  Also, it means
that if the initial tfm allocation fails, then the fallback stays
permanently enabled even if a crct10dif implementation is loaded later.

Change it to use the more logical solution of starting with the fallback
enabled, and disabling the fallback when a tfm gets allocated for the
first time.  This change also ends up simplifying the code.

Also take the opportunity to convert the code to use the new static_key
API, which is much less confusing than the old and deprecated one.
