l2tp: check socket address type in l2tp_dfs_seq_tunnel_show

checkpatch warns about indentation and brace balancing around the
conditionally compiled code for AF_INET6 support in
l2tp_dfs_seq_tunnel_show.

By adding another check on the socket address type we can make the code
more readable while removing the checkpatch warning.
