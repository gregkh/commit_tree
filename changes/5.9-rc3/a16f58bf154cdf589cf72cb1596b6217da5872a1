watchdog: dw_wdt: Support devices with asynch clocks

DW Watchdog IP core can be synthesised with asynchronous timer/APB
clocks support (WDT_ASYNC_CLK_MODE_ENABLE == 1). In this case
separate clock signals are supposed to be used to feed watchdog timer
and APB interface of the device. Currently the driver supports
the synchronous mode only. Since there is no way to determine which
mode was actually activated for device from its registers, we have to
rely on the platform device configuration data. If optional "pclk"
clock source is supplied, we consider the device working in asynchronous
mode, otherwise the driver falls back to the synchronous configuration.
