ALSA: hda/hdmi: Add quirk to force connectivity

HDMI on some platforms doesn't enable audio support because its Port
Connectivity [31:30] is set to AC_JACK_PORT_NONE:
Node 0x05 [Pin Complex] wcaps 0x40778d: 8-Channels Digital Amp-Out CP
  Amp-Out caps: ofs=0x00, nsteps=0x00, stepsize=0x00, mute=1
  Amp-Out vals:  [0x00 0x00]
  Pincap 0x0b000094: OUT Detect HBR HDMI DP
  Pin Default 0x58560010: [N/A] Digital Out at Int HDMI
    Conn = Digital, Color = Unknown
    DefAssociation = 0x1, Sequence = 0x0
  Pin-ctls: 0x40: OUT
  Unsolicited: tag=00, enabled=0
  Power states:  D0 D3 EPSS
  Power: setting=D0, actual=D0
  Devices: 0
  Connection: 3
     0x02 0x03* 0x04

For now, use a quirk to force connectivity based on SSID. If there are
more platforms affected by the same issue, we can eye for a more generic
solution.
