btrfs: sysfs: add bdi link to the fsid directory

Since BTRFS uses a private bdi it makes sense to create a link to this
bdi under /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/bdi. This allows size of read ahead to
be controlled. Without this patch it's not possible to uniquely identify
which bdi pertains to which btrfs filesystem in the case of multiple
btrfs filesystems.

It's fine to simply call sysfs_remove_link without checking if the
link indeed has been created. The call path

sysfs_remove_link
 kernfs_remove_by_name
  kernfs_remove_by_name_ns

will simply return -ENOENT in case it doesn't exist.
