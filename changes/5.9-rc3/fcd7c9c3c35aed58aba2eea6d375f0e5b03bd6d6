arm, arm64: Fix selection of CONFIG_SCHED_THERMAL_PRESSURE

Qian reported that the current setup forgoes the Kconfig dependencies and
results in warnings such as:

  WARNING: unmet direct dependencies detected for SCHED_THERMAL_PRESSURE
    Depends on [n]: SMP [=y] && CPU_FREQ_THERMAL [=n]
    Selected by [y]:
    - ARM64 [=y]

Revert commit

  e17ae7fea871 ("arm, arm64: Select CONFIG_SCHED_THERMAL_PRESSURE")

and re-implement it by making the option default to 'y' for arm64 and arm,
which respects Kconfig dependencies (i.e. will remain 'n' if
CPU_FREQ_THERMAL=n).
