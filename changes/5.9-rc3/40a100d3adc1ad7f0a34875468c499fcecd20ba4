fsnotify: pass dir and inode arguments to fsnotify()

The arguments of fsnotify() are overloaded and mean different things
for different event types.

Replace the to_tell argument with separate arguments @dir and @inode,
because we may be sending to both dir and child.  Using the @data
argument to pass the child is not enough, because dirent events pass
this argument (for audit), but we do not report to child.

Document the new fsnotify() function argumenets.
