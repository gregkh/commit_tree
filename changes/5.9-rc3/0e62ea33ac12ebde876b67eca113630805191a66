erofs: remove WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE flag from unbound wq's

The documentation [1] says that WQ_CPU_INTENSIVE is "meaningless" for
unbound wq. I remove this flag from places where unbound queue is
allocated. This is supposed to improve code readability.

[Gao Xiang: since the original treewide patch [2] hasn't been merged
            yet, handling the EROFS part only for the next cycle. ]
