riscv: disable stack-protector for vDSO

Currently, building the vDSO with clang leads assembler errors like the
following:

  /tmp/vgettimeofday-1ae0d2.s: Assembler messages:
  /tmp/vgettimeofday-1ae0d2.s:28: Error: bad expression
  /tmp/vgettimeofday-1ae0d2.s:28: Error: illegal operands `auipc a2,%got_pcrel_hi(__stack_chk_guard)'

Disable the stack-protector for vDSO to fix these.
