media: sur40: Remove uninitialized_var() usage

Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
(or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings (e.g.
"unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized, either
simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes. As a precursor
to removing[2] this[3] macro[4], just remove this variable since it was
actually unused:

drivers/input/touchscreen/sur40.c:459:6: warning: variable 'packet_id' set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
  459 |  u32 packet_id;
      |      ^~~~~~~~~

However, in keeping with the documentation desires outlined in commit
335abaea7a27 ("Input: sur40 - silence unnecessary noisy debug output"),
comment out the assignment instead of removing it.
