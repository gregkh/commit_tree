blk-cgroup: make iostat functions visible to stat printing

Previously, the code which printed io.stat only needed access to the
generic rstat flushing code, but since we plan to write some more
specific code for preparing root cgroup stats, we need to manipulate
iostat structs directly. Since declaring static functions ahead does not
seem like common practice in this file, simply move the iostat functions
up. We only plan to use blkg_iostat_set, but it seems better to keep them
all together.
