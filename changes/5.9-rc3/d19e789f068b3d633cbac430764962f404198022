compiler.h: Move instrumentation_begin()/end() to new <linux/instrumentation.h> header

Linus pointed out that compiler.h - which is a key header that gets included in every
single one of the 28,000+ kernel files during a kernel build - was bloated in:

  655389666643: ("vmlinux.lds.h: Create section for protection against instrumentation")

Linus noted:

Move these primitives into a new header: <linux/instrumentation.h>, and include that
header in the headers that make use of it.

Unfortunately one of these headers is asm-generic/bug.h, which does get included
in a lot of places, similarly to compiler.h. So the de-bloating effect isn't as
good as we'd like it to be - but at least the interfaces are defined separately.

No change to functionality intended.
