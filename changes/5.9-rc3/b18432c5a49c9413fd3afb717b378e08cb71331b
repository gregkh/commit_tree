net: phy: sfp: Cotsworks SFF module EEPROM fixup

Some Cotsworks SFF have invalid data in the first few bytes of the
module EEPROM.  This results in these modules not being detected as
valid modules.

Address this by poking the correct EEPROM values into the module
EEPROM when the model/PN match and the existing module EEPROM contents
are not correct.
