gpio: gpio-mlxbf2.c: Provide __releases() annotation to stop confusing Sparse

Sparse cannot peer into other functions to see when and if locks are
acquired and released, thus it simply warns that a 'context imbalance'
is detected instead.  Let's be kind to Sparse and let it know that
this behaviour is intentional.

 drivers/gpio/gpio-mlxbf2.c:125:12: warning: context imbalance in 'mlxbf2_gpio_lock_acquire' - different lock contexts for basic block
 drivers/gpio/gpio-mlxbf2.c:151:13: warning: context imbalance in 'mlxbf2_gpio_lock_release' - unexpected unlock
