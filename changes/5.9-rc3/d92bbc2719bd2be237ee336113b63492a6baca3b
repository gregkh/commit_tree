mm/hugetlb: unify migration callbacks

There is no difference between two migration callback functions,
alloc_huge_page_node() and alloc_huge_page_nodemask(), except
__GFP_THISNODE handling.  It's redundant to have two almost similar
functions in order to handle this flag.  So, this patch tries to remove
one by introducing a new argument, gfp_mask, to
alloc_huge_page_nodemask().

After introducing gfp_mask argument, it's caller's job to provide correct
gfp_mask.  So, every callsites for alloc_huge_page_nodemask() are changed
to provide gfp_mask.

Note that it's safe to remove a node id check in alloc_huge_page_node()
since there is no caller passing NUMA_NO_NODE as a node id.
