powerpc/mm/radix: Fix PTE/PMD fragment count for early page table mappings

We can hit the following BUG_ON during memory unplug:

This occurs when unplug is attempted for such memory which has
been mapped using memblock pages as part of early kernel page
table setup. We wouldn't have initialized the PMD or PTE fragment
count for those PMD or PTE pages.

This can be fixed by allocating memory in PAGE_SIZE granularity
during early page table allocation. This makes sure a specific
page is not shared for another memblock allocation and we can
free them correctly on removing page-table pages.

Since we now do PAGE_SIZE allocations for both PUD table and
PMD table (Note that PTE table allocation is already of PAGE_SIZE),
we end up allocating more memory for the same amount of system RAM.
Here is a comparision of how much more we need for a 64T and 2G
system after this patch:

1. 64T system
-------------
64T RAM would need 64G for vmemmap with struct page size being 64B.

128 PUD tables for 64T memory (1G mappings)
1 PUD table and 64 PMD tables for 64G vmemmap (2M mappings)

With default PUD[PMD]_TABLE_SIZE(4K), (128+1+64)*4K=772K
With PAGE_SIZE(64K) table allocations, (128+1+64)*64K=12352K

2. 2G system
------------
2G RAM would need 2M for vmemmap with struct page size being 64B.

1 PUD table for 2G memory (1G mapping)
1 PUD table and 1 PMD table for 2M vmemmap (2M mappings)

With default PUD[PMD]_TABLE_SIZE(4K), (1+1+1)*4K=12K
With new PAGE_SIZE(64K) table allocations, (1+1+1)*64K=192K
