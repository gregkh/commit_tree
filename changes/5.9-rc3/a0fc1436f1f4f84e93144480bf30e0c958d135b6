xtensa: add missing exclusive access state management

The result of the s32ex opcode is recorded in the ATOMCTL special
register and must be retrieved with the getex opcode. Context switch
between s32ex and getex may trash the ATOMCTL register and result in
duplicate update or missing update of the atomic variable.
Add atomctl8 field to the struct thread_info and use getex to swap
ATOMCTL bit 8 as a part of context switch.
Clear exclusive access monitor on kernel entry.
