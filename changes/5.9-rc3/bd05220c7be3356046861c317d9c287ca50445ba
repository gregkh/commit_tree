arch/ia64: Restore arch-specific pgd_offset_k implementation

IA-64 is special and treats pgd_offset_k() differently to pgd_offset(),
using different formulae to calculate the indices into the kernel and user
PGDs.  The index into the user PGDs takes into account the region number,
but the index into the kernel (init_mm) PGD always assumes a predefined
kernel region number. Commit 974b9b2c68f3 ("mm: consolidate pte_index() and
pte_offset_*() definitions") made IA-64 use a generic pgd_offset_k() which
incorrectly used pgd_index() for kernel page tables.  As a result, the
index into the kernel PGD was going out of bounds and the kernel hung
during early boot.

Allow overrides of pgd_offset_k() and override it on IA-64 with the old
implementation that will correctly index the kernel PGD.
