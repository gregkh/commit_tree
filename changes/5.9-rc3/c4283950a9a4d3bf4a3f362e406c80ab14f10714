staging: rtl8192u: fix a dubious looking mask before a shift

Currently the masking of ret with 0xff and followed by a right shift
of 8 bits always leaves a zero result.  It appears the mask of 0xff
is incorrect and should be 0xff00, but I don't have the hardware to
test this. Fix this to mask the upper 8 bits before shifting.
