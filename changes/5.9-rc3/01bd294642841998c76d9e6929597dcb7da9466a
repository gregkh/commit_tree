selftests/powerpc: Allow choice of CI memory location in alignment_handler test

The alignment handler selftest needs cache-inhibited memory and
currently /dev/fb0 is relied on to provided this. This prevents running
the test on systems without /dev/fb0 (e.g., mambo). Read the commandline
arguments for an optional path to be used instead, as well as an
optional offset to be for mmaping this path.
