arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Replace invalid bias-pull-none property

msm8916-pins.dtsi specifies "bias-pull-none" for most of the audio
pin configurations. This was likely copied from the qcom kernel fork
where the same property was used for these audio pins.

However, "bias-pull-none" actually does not exist at all - not in
mainline and not in downstream. I can only guess that the original
intention was to configure "no pull", i.e. bias-disable.

Change it to that instead.
