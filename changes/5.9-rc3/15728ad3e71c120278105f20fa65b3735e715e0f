libbpf: Fix BTF-defined map-in-map initialization on 32-bit host arches

Libbpf built in 32-bit mode should be careful about not conflating 64-bit BPF
pointers in BPF ELF file and host architecture pointers. This patch fixes
issue of incorrect initializating of map-in-map inner map slots due to such
difference.
