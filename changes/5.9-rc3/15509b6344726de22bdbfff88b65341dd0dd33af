ALSA: hda: generic: Add vmaster mute LED helper

Like mic-mute LED handling, add a new helper to deal with the master
mute LED with LED classdev.  Unlike the mic-mute case, the playback
master mute is hooked on vmaster, and we suppose no nested hooks
allowed there.

The classdev creation code is factored out to a common function that
is called from both mute and mic-mute LED helpers.
