media: tpg: Add function to return colors' order of test image

Currently there is no method to know the correct order of the colors for
a test image generated by tpg. Write a function that returns a string of
colors' order given a tpg. It returns a NULL pointer in case of test
patterns which do not have a well defined colors' order. Hence add a
NULL check for text in tpg_gen_text().
