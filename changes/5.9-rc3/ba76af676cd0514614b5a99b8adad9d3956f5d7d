nvmet: Add passthru enable/disable helpers

This patch adds helper functions which are used in the NVMeOF configfs
when the user is configuring the passthru subsystem. Here we ensure
that only one subsys is assigned to each nvme_ctrl by using an xarray
on the cntlid.

The subsystem's version number is overridden by the passed through
controller's version. However, if that version is less than 1.2.1,
then we bump the advertised version to that and print a warning
in dmesg.
