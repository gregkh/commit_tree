btrfs: read stripe len directly in btrfs_rmap_block

extent_map::orig_block_len contains the size of a physical stripe when
it's used to describe block groups (calculated in read_one_chunk via
calc_stripe_length or calculated in decide_stripe_size and then assigned
to extent_map::orig_block_len in create_chunk). Exploit this fact to get
the size directly rather than opencoding the calculations. No functional
changes.
