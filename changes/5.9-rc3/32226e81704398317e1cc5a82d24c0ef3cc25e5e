macintosh/adb-iop: Implement idle -> sending state transition

In the present algorithm, the 'idle' state transition does not take
place until there's a bus timeout. Once idle, the driver does not
automatically proceed with the next request.

Change the algorithm so that queued ADB requests will be sent as soon as
the driver becomes idle. This is to take place after the current IOP
message is completed.
