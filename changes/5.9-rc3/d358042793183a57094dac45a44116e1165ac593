powerpc/pmem: Add flush routines using new pmem store and sync instruction

Start using dcbstps; phwsync; sequence for flushing persistent memory range.
The new instructions are implemented as a variant of dcbf and hwsync and on
P8 and P9 they will be executed as those instructions. We avoid using them on
older hardware. This helps to avoid difficult to debug bugs.
