selftests: forwarding: Add a RED test for SW datapath

This test is inspired by the mlxsw RED selftest. It is much simpler to set
up (also because there is no point in testing PRIO / RED encapsulation). It
tests bare RED, ECN and ECN+nodrop modes of operation. On top of that it
tests RED early_drop and mark qevents.
