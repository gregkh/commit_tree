iio: core: fix/re-introduce back parent assignment

This was introduced initially via commit 78289b4a58b58 ("iio: core: pass
parent device as parameter during allocation"), but was accidentally
removed via commit 6d4ebd565d15f ("iio: core: wrap IIO device into an
iio_dev_opaque object").

This looks like a rebase gone wrong, and ends up breaking devicetree
bindings of IIO clients.

This change adds back the parent assignment.

Fixes 6d4ebd565d15f: ("iio: core: wrap IIO device into an iio_dev_opaque object")
