mmc: core: Add MMC_CAP2_FULL_PWR_CYCLE_IN_SUSPEND

The commit 5a36d6bcdf23 ("mmc: core: Add DT-bindings for
MMC_CAP2_FULL_PWR_CYCLE") added the "full-pwr-cycle" property which
is possible to perform a full power cycle of the card at any time.

However, some environment (like r8a77951-salvator-xs) is possible
to perform a full power cycle of the card in suspend via firmware
(PSCI on arm-trusted-firmware). So, in worst case, since we are
not doing a graceful shutdown of the eMMC device (just cut VCCQ
while the eMMC is "sleeping") in suspend, it could lead to internal
data corruptions. So, add MMC_CAP2_FULL_PWR_CYCLE_IN_SUSPEND
to do a graceful shutdown which issues Power Off notification
before entering system suspend.
