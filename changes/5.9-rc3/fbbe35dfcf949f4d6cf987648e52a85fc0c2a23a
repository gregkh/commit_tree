watchdog: use __watchdog_ping in startup

Current watchdog startup functionality does not respect the minimum hw
heartbeat setup and the last watchdog ping timeframe when watchdog is
already running and userspace process attaches to it. Fix this by using
the __watchdog_ping from the startup also. For this code path, we can
also let the __watchdog_ping handle the bookkeeping for the worker and
last keepalive times.
