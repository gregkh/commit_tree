svcrdma: Introduce infrastructure to support completion IDs

The goal is to replace CQE kernel memory addresses in completion-
related tracepoints.

Each completion ID matches an incoming Send or Receive completion
to a Completion Queue and to a previous ib_post_*(). The ID can
then be displayed in an error message or recorded in a trace
record.
