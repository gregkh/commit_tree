vfio/pci: Add QAT devices to denylist

The current generation of Intel® QuickAssist Technology devices
are not designed to run in an untrusted environment because of the
following issues reported in the document "Intel® QuickAssist Technology
(Intel® QAT) Software for Linux" (document number 336211-014):

QATE-39220 - GEN - Intel® QAT API submissions with bad addresses that
             trigger DMA to invalid or unmapped addresses can cause a
             platform hang
QATE-7495  - GEN - An incorrectly formatted request to Intel® QAT can
             hang the entire Intel® QAT Endpoint

The document is downloadable from https://01.org/intel-quickassist-technology

This patch adds the following QAT devices to the denylist: DH895XCC,
C3XXX and C62X.
