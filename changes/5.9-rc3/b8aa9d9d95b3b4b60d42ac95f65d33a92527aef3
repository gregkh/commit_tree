mm/mremap: it is sure to have enough space when extent meets requirement

Patch series "mm/mremap: cleanup move_page_tables() a little", v5.

move_page_tables() tries to move page table by PMD or PTE.

The root reason is if it tries to move PMD, both old and new range should
be PMD aligned.  But current code calculate old range and new range
separately.  This leads to some redundant check and calculation.

This cleanup tries to consolidate the range check in one place to reduce
some extra range handling.

This patch (of 3):

old_end is passed to these two functions to check whether there is enough
space to do the move, while this check is done before invoking these
functions.

These two functions only would be invoked when extent meets the
requirement and there is one check before invoking these functions:

    if (extent > old_end - old_addr)
        extent = old_end - old_addr;

This implies (old_end - old_addr) won't fail the check in these two
functions.
