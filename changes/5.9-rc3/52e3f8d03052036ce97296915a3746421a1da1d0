mm/arc: use general page fault accounting

Use the general page fault accounting by passing regs into
handle_mm_fault().  It naturally solve the issue of multiple page fault
accounting when page fault retry happened.

Fix PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS perf event manually for page fault retries,
by moving it before taking mmap_sem.
