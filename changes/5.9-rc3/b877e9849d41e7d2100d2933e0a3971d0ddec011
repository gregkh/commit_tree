KVM: arm64: Build hyp-entry.S separately for VHE/nVHE

hyp-entry.S contains implementation of KVM hyp vectors. This code is mostly
shared between VHE/nVHE, therefore compile it under both VHE and nVHE build
rules. nVHE-specific host HVC handler is hidden behind __KVM_NVHE_HYPERVISOR__.

Adjust code which selects which KVM hyp vecs to install to choose the correct
VHE/nVHE symbol.
