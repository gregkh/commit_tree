umh: Capture the pid in umh_pipe_setup

The pid in struct subprocess_info is only used by umh_clean_and_save_pid to
write the pid into umh_info.

Instead always capture the pid on struct umh_info in umh_pipe_setup, removing
code that is specific to user mode drivers from the common user path of
user mode helpers.
