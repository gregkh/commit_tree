scsi: ufs: Add program_key() variant op

On Snapdragon SoCs, the Linux kernel isn't permitted to directly access the
standard UFS crypto configuration registers.  Instead, programming and
evicting keys must be done through vendor-specific SMC calls.

To support this hardware, add a ->program_key() method to 'struct
ufs_hba_variant_ops'.  This allows overriding the UFS standard key
programming / eviction procedure.
