mm/sparse: cleanup the code surrounding memory_present()

After removal of CONFIG_HAVE_MEMBLOCK_NODE_MAP we have two equivalent
functions that call memory_present() for each region in memblock.memory:
sparse_memory_present_with_active_regions() and membocks_present().

Moreover, all architectures have a call to either of these functions
preceding the call to sparse_init() and in the most cases they are called
one after the other.

Mark the regions from memblock.memory as present during sparce_init() by
making sparse_init() call memblocks_present(), make memblocks_present()
and memory_present() functions static and remove redundant
sparse_memory_present_with_active_regions() function.

Also remove no longer required HAVE_MEMORY_PRESENT configuration option.
