serial: pch_uart: use generic power management

Drivers using legacy PM have to manage PCI states and device's PM states
themselves. They also need to take care of configuration registers.

With improved and powerful support of generic PM, PCI Core takes care of
above mentioned, device-independent, jobs.

This driver makes use of PCI helper functions like
pci_save/restore_state(), pci_enable_device() and pci_set_power_state()
to do required operations. In generic mode, they are no longer needed.

Change function parameter in both .suspend() and .resume() to
"struct device*" type. Use dev_get_drvdata() to get drv data.

Compile-tested only.
