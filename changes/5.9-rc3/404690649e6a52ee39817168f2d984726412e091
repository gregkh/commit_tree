ALSA: hda - reverse the setting value in the micmute_led_set

Before the micmute_led_set() is introduced, the function of
alc_gpio_micmute_update() will set the gpio value with the
!micmute_led.led_value, and the machines have the correct micmute led
status. After the micmute_led_set() is introduced, it sets the gpio
value with !!micmute_led.led_value, so the led status is not correct
anymore, we need to set micmute_led_polarity = 1 to workaround it.

Now we fix the micmute_led_set() and remove micmute_led_polarity = 1.
