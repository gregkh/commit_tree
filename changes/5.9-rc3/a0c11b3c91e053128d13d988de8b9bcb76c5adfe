misc: habanalabs: firmware_if: Add missing 'fw_name' and 'dst' entries to function header

Looks as though documentation for these function arguments have
been missing since the driver's inception last year.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warnings:

 drivers/misc/habanalabs/firmware_if.c:26: warning: Function parameter or member 'fw_name' not described in 'hl_fw_load_fw_to_device'
 drivers/misc/habanalabs/firmware_if.c:26: warning: Function parameter or member 'dst' not described in 'hl_fw_load_fw_to_device'
