drm/i915/gem: Drop forced struct_mutex from shrinker_taints_mutex

Since we no longer always take struct_mutex around everything, and want
the freedom to create GEM objects, actually taking struct_mutex inside
the lock creation ends up pulling the mutex inside other looks. Since we
don't use generally use struct_mutex, we can relax the tainting.
