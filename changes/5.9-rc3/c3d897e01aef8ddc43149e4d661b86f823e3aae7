hv_netvsc: Fix the queue_mapping in netvsc_vf_xmit()

netvsc_vf_xmit() / dev_queue_xmit() will call VF NIC’s ndo_select_queue
or netdev_pick_tx() again. They will use skb_get_rx_queue() to get the
queue number, so the “skb->queue_mapping - 1” will be used. This may
cause the last queue of VF not been used.

Use skb_record_rx_queue() here, so that the skb_get_rx_queue() called
later will get the correct queue number, and VF will be able to use
all queues.
