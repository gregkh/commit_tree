x86/cpu: Relocate sync_core() to sync_core.h

Having sync_core() in processor.h is problematic since it is not possible
to check for hardware capabilities via the *cpu_has() family of macros.
The latter needs the definitions in processor.h.

It also looks more intuitive to relocate the function to sync_core.h.

This changeset does not make changes in functionality.
