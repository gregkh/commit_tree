ice: fix link event handling timing

When the driver experiences a link event (especially link up)
there can be multiple events generated. Some of these are
link fault and still have a state of DOWN set.  The problem
happens when the link comes UP during the PF driver handling
one of the LINK DOWN events.  The status of the link is updated
and is now seen as UP, so when the actual LINK UP event comes,
the port information has already been updated to be seen as UP,
even though none of the UP activities have been completed.

After the link information has been updated in the link
handler and evaluated for MEDIA PRESENT, if the state
of the link has been changed to UP, treat the DOWN event
as an UP event since the link is now UP.
