staging: greybus: audio: Maintain jack list within GB Audio module

As per the current implementation for GB codec driver, a jack list is
maintained for each module. And it expects the list to be populated by
the snd_soc_jack structure which would require modifications in
mainstream code.

However, this is not a necessary requirement and the list can be easily
maintained within gbaudio_module_info as well. This patch provides the
relevant changes for the same.
