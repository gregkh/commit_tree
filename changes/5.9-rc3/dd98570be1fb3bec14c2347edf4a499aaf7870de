xhci: dbc: Pass dbc pointer to dbc memory init and cleanup functions

Dbc mem_init and mem_cleanup functions used xhci_hcd to get to the device
pointer. The device pointer can be accessed directly from dbc structure,
so pass a pointer to dbc as a parameter instead.

No functional changes
This change helps decoupling xhci and DbC
