x86/mm: Pre-allocate P4D/PUD pages for vmalloc area

Pre-allocate the page-table pages for the vmalloc area at the level
which needs synchronization on x86-64, which is P4D for 5-level and
PUD for 4-level paging.

Doing this at boot makes sure no synchronization of that area is
necessary at runtime. The synchronization takes the pgd_lock and
iterates over all page-tables in the system, so it can take quite long
and is better avoided.
