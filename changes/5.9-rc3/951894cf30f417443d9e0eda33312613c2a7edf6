ALSA: hda/hdmi: Add Intel silent stream support

External HDMI receivers have analog circuitry that needs to be powered-on
when exiting standby, and a mechanism to detect PCM v. IEC61937 data.
These two steps take time and up to 2-3 seconds of audio may be muted
when starting playback.

Intel hardware (Haswell and beyond) can keep the link active
with a 'silent stream', so that the receiver does not go through those
two steps when valid audio is transmitted. This mechanism relies
on an setting the channel_id as 0xf, sending info packet and preventing
the codec from going to D3,  which will increase the platform
static power consumption. The info packet assumes a basic 2ch stereo,
and the silent stream is enabled when connecting a monitor.
In case of format changes the detection of PCM v. IEC61937 needs to
be re-run. In this case there is no way to avoid the 2-3s mute.

The silent stream is enabled with a Kconfig option, as well as a kernel
parameter should there be a need to override the build time default.
This approach is used based on the power_save capability as an example,
but in the future, it may be used with a kcontrol,
depending on UCM support for HDaudio legacy.
