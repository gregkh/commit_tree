staging: wfx: add a debugfs entry to force ps_timeout

In some advanced usage or debug scenarios, it could interesting to
change the value of ps_timeout or eventually to force use of PS-Poll
frames.

The wext API (used by iwconfig) provide a way to change ps_timeout.
However, this API is obsolete and it seems a little weird to use (it
seems it does apply the change, so the user have to disable then
re-enable de power save)

On side of nl80211, there is no way to change the ps_timeout.

This patch provides a file in debugfs to change the value of ps_timeout.
