scripts/bloat-o-meter: Support comparing library archives

Library archives (.a) usually contain multiple object files so their
output of nm --size-sort contains lines like:

<omitted for brevity>
00000000000003a8 t run_test

extent-map-tests.o:
<omitted for brevity>

bloat-o-meter currently doesn't handle them which results in errors when
calling .split() on them.  Fix this by simply ignoring them.  This enables
diffing subsystems which generate built-in.a files.
