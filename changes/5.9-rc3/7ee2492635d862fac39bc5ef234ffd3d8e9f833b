mptcp: fix warn at shutdown time for unaccepted msk sockets

With commit b93df08ccda3 ("mptcp: explicitly track the fully
established status"), the status of unaccepted mptcp closed in
mptcp_sock_destruct() changes from TCP_SYN_RECV to TCP_ESTABLISHED.

As a result mptcp_sock_destruct() does not perform the proper
cleanup and inet_sock_destruct() will later emit a warn.

Address the issue updating the condition tested in mptcp_sock_destruct().
Also update the related comment.
