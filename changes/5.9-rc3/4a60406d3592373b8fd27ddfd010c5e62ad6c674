driver core: platform: expose numa_node to users in sysfs

Some platform devices like ARM SMMU are memory-mapped and populated by ACPI/IORT.
In this case, NUMA topology of those platform devices are exported by firmware as
well. Software might care about the numa_node of those devices in order to achieve
NUMA locality.
This patch will show the numa_node for this kind of devices in sysfs. For those
platform devices without numa, numa_node won't be visible.
