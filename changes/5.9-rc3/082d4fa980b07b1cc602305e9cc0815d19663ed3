tcp: update delivered_ce with delivered

Currently tp->delivered is updated in various places in tcp_ack() but
tp->delivered_ce is updated once at the end. As a result two counts in
OPT_STATS of SCM_TSTAMP_ACK timestamps generated in tcp_ack() may not be
in sync. This patch updates both counts at the same in tcp_ack().
