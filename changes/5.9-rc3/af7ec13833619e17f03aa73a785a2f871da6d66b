bpf: Add bpf_skc_to_tcp6_sock() helper

The helper is used in tracing programs to cast a socket
pointer to a tcp6_sock pointer.
The return value could be NULL if the casting is illegal.

A new helper return type RET_PTR_TO_BTF_ID_OR_NULL is added
so the verifier is able to deduce proper return types for the helper.

Different from the previous BTF_ID based helpers,
the bpf_skc_to_tcp6_sock() argument can be several possible
btf_ids. More specifically, all possible socket data structures
with sock_common appearing in the first in the memory layout.
This patch only added socket types related to tcp and udp.

All possible argument btf_id and return value btf_id
for helper bpf_skc_to_tcp6_sock() are pre-calculcated and
cached. In the future, it is even possible to precompute
these btf_id's at kernel build time.
