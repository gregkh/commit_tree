kvm: x86: Add "last CPU" to some KVM_EXIT information

More often than not, a failed VM-entry in an x86 production
environment is induced by a defective CPU. To help identify the bad
hardware, include the id of the last logical CPU to run a vCPU in the
information provided to userspace on a KVM exit for failed VM-entry or
for KVM internal errors not associated with emulation. The presence of
this additional information is indicated by a new capability,
KVM_CAP_LAST_CPU.
