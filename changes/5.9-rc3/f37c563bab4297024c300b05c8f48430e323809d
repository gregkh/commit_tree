btrfs: add missing check for nocow and compression inode flags

User Forza reported on IRC that some invalid combinations of file
attributes are accepted by chattr.

The NODATACOW and compression file flags/attributes are mutually
exclusive, but they could be set by 'chattr +c +C' on an empty file. The
nodatacow will be in effect because it's checked first in
btrfs_run_delalloc_range.

Extend the flag validation to catch the following cases:

  - input flags are conflicting
  - old and new flags are conflicting
  - initialize the local variable with inode flags after inode ls locked

Inode attributes take precedence over mount options and are an
independent setting.

Nocompress would be a no-op with nodatacow, but we don't want to mix
any compression-related options with nodatacow.
