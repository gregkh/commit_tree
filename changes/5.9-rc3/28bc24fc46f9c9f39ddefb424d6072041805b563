vc: separate state

There are two copies of some members of struct vc_data. This is because
we need to save them and restore later. Move these memebers to a
separate structure called vc_state. So now instead of members like:
  vc_x, vc_y and vc_saved_x, vc_saved_y
we have
  state and saved_state (of type: struct vc_state)
containing
  state.x, state.y and saved_state.x, saved_state.y

This change:
* makes clear what is saved & restored
* eases save & restore by using memcpy (see save_cur and restore_cur)

Finally, we document the newly added struct vc_state using kernel-doc.
