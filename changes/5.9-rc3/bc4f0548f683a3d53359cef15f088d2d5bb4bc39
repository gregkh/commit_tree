bpf: Compute bpf_skc_to_*() helper socket btf ids at build time

Currently, socket types (struct tcp_sock, udp_sock, etc.)
used by bpf_skc_to_*() helpers are computed when vmlinux_btf
is first built in the kernel.

Commit 5a2798ab32ba
("bpf: Add BTF_ID_LIST/BTF_ID/BTF_ID_UNUSED macros")
implemented a mechanism to compute btf_ids at kernel build
time which can simplify kernel implementation and reduce
runtime overhead by removing in-kernel btf_id calculation.
This patch did exactly this, removing in-kernel btf_id
computation and utilizing build-time btf_id computation.

If CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF is not defined, BTF_ID_LIST will
define an array with size of 5, which is not enough for
btf_sock_ids. So define its own static array if
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF is not defined.
