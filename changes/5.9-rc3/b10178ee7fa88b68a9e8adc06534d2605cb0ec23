scsi: ufs: Clean up completed request without interrupt notification

If somehow no interrupt notification is raised for a completed request and
its doorbell bit is cleared by host, UFS driver needs to cleanup its
outstanding bit in ufshcd_abort(). Otherwise, system may behave abnormally
in the following scenario:

After ufshcd_abort() returns, this request will be requeued by SCSI layer
with its outstanding bit set. Any future completed request will trigger
ufshcd_transfer_req_compl() to handle all "completed outstanding bits". At
this time the "abnormal outstanding bit" will be detected and the "requeued
request" will be chosen to execute request post-processing flow. This is
wrong because this request is still "alive".
