misc: habanalabs: gaudi: Remove ill placed asterisk from kerneldoc header

W=1 kernel builds report a lack of description of gaudi_set_asic_funcs()'s
'hdev' argument.  In reality it is documented, but the formatting
was not as expected '@.*:'.  Instead, there was a misplaced asterisk
which was confusing the kerneldoc validator.

Squashes the following W=1 warning:

 drivers/misc/habanalabs/gaudi/gaudi.c:6746: warning: Function parameter or member 'hdev' not described in 'gaudi_set_asic_funcs'
