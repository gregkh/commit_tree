fanotify: report parent fid + name + child fid

For a group with fanotify_init() flag FAN_REPORT_DFID_NAME, the parent
fid and name are reported for events on non-directory objects with an
info record of type FAN_EVENT_INFO_TYPE_DFID_NAME.

If the group also has the init flag FAN_REPORT_FID, the child fid
is also reported with another info record that follows the first info
record. The second info record is the same info record that would have
been reported to a group with only FAN_REPORT_FID flag.

When the child fid needs to be recorded, the variable size struct
fanotify_name_event is preallocated with enough space to store the
child fh between the dir fh and the name.
