i2c: revert "i2c: core: Allow drivers to disable i2c-core irq mapping"

This manually reverts commit d1d84bb95364ed604015c2b788caaf3dbca0262f.
The only user has gone two years ago with commit 589edb56b424 ("ACPI /
scan: Create platform device for INT33FE ACPI nodes") and no new user
has showed up. Remove and hope we will never need it again.
