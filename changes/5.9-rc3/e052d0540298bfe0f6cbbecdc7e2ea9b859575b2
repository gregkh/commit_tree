can: j1939: transport: j1939_xtp_rx_dat_one(): compare own packets to detect corruptions

Since the stack relays on receiving own packets, it was overwriting own
transmit buffer from received packets.

At least theoretically, the received echo buffer can be corrupt or
changed and the session partner can request to resend previous data. In
this case we will re-send bad data.

With this patch we will stop to overwrite own TX buffer and use it for
sanity checking.
