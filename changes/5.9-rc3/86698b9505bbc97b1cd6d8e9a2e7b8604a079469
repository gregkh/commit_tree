media: mtk-mdp: convert mtk_mdp_dev.comp array to list

The functions mtk_mdp_register/unregister_component have been created to
add / remove items from the list of components.

This will eventually enable us to specify a list of components in the
device tree instead of hardcoding them into this driver.

The list is modified by a single thread at driver probe time, and will
not be traversed by another thread until the call to pm_runtime_enable
at the end of probing.
