vt: defer kfree() of vc_screenbuf in vc_do_resize()

syzbot is reporting UAF bug in set_origin() from vc_do_resize() [1], for
vc_do_resize() calls kfree(vc->vc_screenbuf) before calling set_origin().

Unfortunately, in set_origin(), vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin() might access
vc->vc_pos when scroll is involved in order to manipulate cursor, but
vc->vc_pos refers already released vc->vc_screenbuf until vc->vc_pos gets
updated based on the result of vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin().

Preserving old buffer and tolerating outdated vc members until set_origin()
completes would be easier than preventing vc->vc_sw->con_set_origin() from
accessing outdated vc members.
