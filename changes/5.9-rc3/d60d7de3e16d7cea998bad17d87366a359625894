lib/vdso: Allow to add architecture-specific vdso data

The initial assumption that all VDSO related data can be completely generic
does not hold. S390 needs architecture specific storage to access the clock
steering information.

Add struct arch_vdso_data to the vdso data struct. For architectures which
do not need extra data this defaults to an empty struct. Architectures
which require it, enable CONFIG_ARCH_HAS_VDSO_DATA and provide their
specific struct in asm/vdso/data.h.
