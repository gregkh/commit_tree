umd: Stop using split_argv

There is exactly one argument so there is nothing to split.  All
split_argv does now is cause confusion and avoid the need for a cast
when passing a "const char *" string to call_usermodehelper_setup.

So avoid confusion and the possibility of an odd driver name causing
problems by just using a fixed argv array with a cast in the call to
call_usermodehelper_setup.
