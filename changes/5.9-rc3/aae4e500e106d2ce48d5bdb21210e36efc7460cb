net: mscc: ocelot: generalize the "ACE/ACL" names

Access Control Lists (and their respective Access Control Entries) are
specifically entries in the VCAP IS2, the security enforcement block,
according to the documentation.
Let's rename the structures and functions to something more generic, so
that VCAP IS1 structures (which would otherwise have to be called
Ingress Classification Entries) can reuse the same code without
confusion.

Some renaming that was done:

struct ocelot_ace_rule -> struct ocelot_vcap_filter
struct ocelot_acl_block -> struct ocelot_vcap_block
enum ocelot_ace_type -> enum ocelot_vcap_key_type
struct ocelot_ace_vlan -> struct ocelot_vcap_key_vlan
enum ocelot_ace_action -> enum ocelot_vcap_action
struct ocelot_ace_stats -> struct ocelot_vcap_stats
enum ocelot_ace_type -> enum ocelot_vcap_key_type
struct ocelot_ace_frame_* -> struct ocelot_vcap_key_*

No functional change is intended.
