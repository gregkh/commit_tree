md/raid5: set default stripe_size as 4096

In RAID5, if issued bio size is bigger than stripe_size, it will be
split in the unit of stripe_size and process them one by one. Even
for size less then stripe_size, RAID5 also request data from disk at
least of stripe_size.

Nowdays, stripe_size is equal to the value of PAGE_SIZE. Since filesystem
usually issue bio in the unit of 4KB, there is no problem for PAGE_SIZE
as 4KB. But, for 64KB PAGE_SIZE, bio from filesystem requests 4KB data
while RAID5 issue IO at least stripe_size (64KB) each time. That will
waste resource of disk bandwidth and compute xor.

To avoding the waste, we want to make stripe_size configurable. This
patch just set default stripe_size as 4096. User can also set the value
bigger than 4KB for some special requirements, such as we know the
issued io size is more than 4KB.

To evaluate the new feature, we create raid5 device '/dev/md5' with
4 SSD disk and test it on arm64 machine with 64KB PAGE_SIZE.

1) We format /dev/md5 with mkfs.ext4 and mount ext4 with default
 configure on /mnt directory. Then, trying to test it by dbench with
 command: dbench -D /mnt -t 1000 10. Result show as:

 'stripe_size = 64KB'

 It show that setting stripe_size as 4KB has higher thoughput, i.e.
 (376.777 vs 307.799) and has smaller latency than that setting as 64KB.

 2) We try to evaluate IO throughput for /dev/md5 by fio with config:

 [4KB randwrite]
 direct=1
 numjob=2
 iodepth=64
 ioengine=libaio
 filename=/dev/md5
 bs=4KB
 rw=randwrite

 [64KB write]
 direct=1
 numjob=2
 iodepth=64
 ioengine=libaio
 filename=/dev/md5
 bs=1MB
 rw=write

 The result as follow:

               +                   +
               | stripe_size(64KB) | stripe_size(4KB)
 +----------------------------------------------------+
 4KB randwrite |     15MB/s        |      100MB/s
 +----------------------------------------------------+
 1MB write     |   1000MB/s        |      700MB/s

 The result show that when size of io is bigger than 4KB (64KB),
 64KB stripe_size has much higher IOPS. But for 4KB randwrite, that
 means, size of io issued to device are smaller, 4KB stripe_size
 have better performance.

Normally, default value (4096) can get relatively good performance.
But if each issued io is bigger than 4096, setting value more than
4096 may get better performance.

Here, we just set default stripe_size as 4096, and we will try to
support setting different stripe_size by sysfs interface in the
following patch.
