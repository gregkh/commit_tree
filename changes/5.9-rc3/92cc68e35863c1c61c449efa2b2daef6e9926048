drm/vblank: Use spin_(un)lock_irq() in drm_crtc_vblank_on()

This is only called from:
* Atomic modesetting hooks
* Module probing routines
* Legacy modesetting hooks

All of which have IRQs enabled, so we can also get rid of
irqsave/restore here to make the IRQ context of this function more
obvious.
