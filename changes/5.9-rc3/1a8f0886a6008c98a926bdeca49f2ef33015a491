powerpc/perf/hv-24x7: Add cpu hotplug support

Patch here adds cpu hotplug functions to hv_24x7 pmu.
A new cpuhp_state "CPUHP_AP_PERF_POWERPC_HV_24x7_ONLINE" enum
is added.

The online callback function updates the cpumask only if its
empty. As the primary intention of adding hotplug support
is to designate a CPU to make HCALL to collect the
counter data.

The offline function test and clear corresponding cpu in a cpumask
and update cpumask to any other active cpu.
