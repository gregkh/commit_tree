inotify: do not set FS_EVENT_ON_CHILD in non-dir mark mask

FS_EVENT_ON_CHILD has currently no meaning for non-dir inode marks. In
the following patches we want to use that bit to mean that mark's
notification group cares about parent and name information. So stop
setting FS_EVENT_ON_CHILD for non-dir marks.
