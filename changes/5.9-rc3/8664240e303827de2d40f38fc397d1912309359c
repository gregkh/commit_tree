net: atlantic: add alignment checks in hw_atl2_utils_fw.c

This patch adds alignment checks in all the helper macros in
hw_atl2_utils_fw.c
These alignment checks are compile-time, so runtime is not affected.

All these helper macros assume the length to be aligned (multiple of 4).
If it's not aligned, then there might be issues, e.g. stack corruption.
