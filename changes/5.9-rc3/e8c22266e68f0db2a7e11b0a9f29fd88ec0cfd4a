KVM: async_pf: change kvm_setup_async_pf()/kvm_arch_setup_async_pf() return type to bool

Unlike normal 'int' functions returning '0' on success, kvm_setup_async_pf()/
kvm_arch_setup_async_pf() return '1' when a job to handle page fault
asynchronously was scheduled and '0' otherwise. To avoid the confusion
change return type to 'bool'.

No functional change intended.
