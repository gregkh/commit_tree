xfs: preserve inode versioning across remounts

The MS_I_VERSION mount flag is exposed via the VFS, as documented
in the mount manpages etc; see the iversion and noiversion mount
options in mount(8).

As a result, mount -o remount looks for this option in /proc/mounts
and will only send the I_VERSION flag back in during remount it it
is present.  Since it's not there, a remount will /remove/ the
I_VERSION flag at the vfs level, and iversion functionality is lost.

xfs v5 superblocks intend to always have i_version enabled; it is
set as a default at mount time, but is lost during remount for the
reasons above.

The generic fix would be to expose this documented option in
/proc/mounts, but since that was rejected, fix it up again in the
xfs remount path instead, so that at least xfs won't suffer from
this misbehavior.
