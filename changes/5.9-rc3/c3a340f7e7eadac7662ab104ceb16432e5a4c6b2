sched: Have sched_class_highest define by vmlinux.lds.h

Now that the sched_class descriptors are defined by the linker script, and
this needs to be aware of the existance of stop_sched_class when SMP is
enabled or not, as it is used as the "highest" priority when defined. Move
the declaration of sched_class_highest to the same location in the linker
script that inserts stop_sched_class, and this will also make it easier to
see what should be defined as the highest class, as this linker script
location defines the priorities as well.
