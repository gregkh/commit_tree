net/mlx5: E-switch, Use eswitch total_vports

Currently steering table and rx group initialization helper
routines works on the total_vports passed as input parameter.

Both eswitch helpers work on the mlx5_eswitch and thereby have access
to esw->total_vports. Hence use it directly instead of passing it
via function input arguments.
