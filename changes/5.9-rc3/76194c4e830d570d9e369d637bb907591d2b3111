seccomp: Lift wait_queue into struct seccomp_filter

Lift the wait_queue from struct notification into struct seccomp_filter.
This is cleaner overall and lets us avoid having to take the notifier
mutex in the future for EPOLLHUP notifications since we need to neither
read nor modify the notifier specific aspects of the seccomp filter. In
the exit path I'd very much like to avoid having to take the notifier mutex
for each filter in the task's filter hierarchy.
