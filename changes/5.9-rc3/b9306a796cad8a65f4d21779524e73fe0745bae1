mm: filemap: clear idle flag for writes

Since commit bbddabe2e436aa ("mm: filemap: only do access activations on
reads"), mark_page_accessed() is called for reads only.  But the idle flag
is cleared by mark_page_accessed() so the idle flag won't get cleared if
the page is write accessed only.

Basically idle page tracking is used to estimate workingset size of
workload, noticeable size of workingset might be missed if the idle flag
is not maintained correctly.

It seems good enough to just clear idle flag for write operations.
