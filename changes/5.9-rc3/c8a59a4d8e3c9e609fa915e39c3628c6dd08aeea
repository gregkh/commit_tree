x86/microcode: Do not select FW_LOADER

The x86 microcode support works just fine without FW_LOADER. In fact,
these days most people load microcode early during boot so FW_LOADER
never gets into the picture anyway.

As almost everyone on x86 needs to enable MICROCODE, this by extension
means that FW_LOADER is always built into the kernel even if nothing
uses it. The FW_LOADER system is about two thousand lines long and
contains user-space facing interfaces that could potentially provide an
entry point into the kernel (or beyond).

Remove the unnecessary select of FW_LOADER by MICROCODE. People who need
the FW_LOADER capability can still enable it.
