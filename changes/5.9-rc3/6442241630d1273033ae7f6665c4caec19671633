media: ti-vpe: cal: Index CSI-2 port starting at 0

The datasheet numbers the CSI-2 PHYs (external to the CAL) starting from
1, but the PPI inputs to the CAL starting from 0. Update the numbering
scheme for csi2_port to match the datasheet, which also simplifies the
driver by removing the need to constantly subtract 1 from the value.
