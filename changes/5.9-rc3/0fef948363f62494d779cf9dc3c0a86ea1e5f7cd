io_uring: make offset == -1 consistent with preadv2/pwritev2

The man page for io_uring generally claims were consistent with what
preadv2 and pwritev2 accept, but turns out there's a slight discrepancy
in how offset == -1 is handled for pipes/streams. preadv doesn't allow
it, but preadv2 does. This currently causes io_uring to return -EINVAL
if that is attempted, but we should allow that as documented.

This change makes us consistent with preadv2/pwritev2 for just passing
in a NULL ppos for streams if the offset is -1.
