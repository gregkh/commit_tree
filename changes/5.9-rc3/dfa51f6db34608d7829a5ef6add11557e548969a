spi: spi-ep93xx: Fix API slippage

ep93xx_spi_read_write() changed is parameters, but the function
documentation was left unchanged.  Let's realign.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/spi/spi-ep93xx.c:227: warning: Function parameter or member 'master' not described in 'ep93xx_spi_read_write'
 drivers/spi/spi-ep93xx.c:227: warning: Excess function parameter 'espi' description in 'ep93xx_spi_read_write'
