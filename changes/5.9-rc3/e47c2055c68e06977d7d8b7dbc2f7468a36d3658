KVM: arm64: Make struct kvm_regs userspace-only

struct kvm_regs is used by userspace to indicate which register gets
accessed by the {GET,SET}_ONE_REG API. But as we're about to refactor
the layout of the in-kernel register structures, we need the kernel to
move away from it.

Let's make kvm_regs userspace only, and let the kernel map it to its own
internal representation.
