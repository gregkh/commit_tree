regulator: Allow regulators to verify enabled during enable()

Some regulators might need to verify that they have indeed been enabled
after the enable() call is made and enable_time delay has passed.

This is implemented by repeatedly checking is_enabled() upto
poll_enabled_time, waiting for the already calculated enable delay in
each iteration.
