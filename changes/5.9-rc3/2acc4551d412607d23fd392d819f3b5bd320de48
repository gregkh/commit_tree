net/mlx5e: CT: Return err_ptr from internal functions

Instead of having to deal with converting between int and ERR_PTR for
return values in mlx5_tc_ct_flow_offload(), make the internal helper
functions return a ptr to mlx5_flow_handle instead of passing it as
output param, this will also avoid gcc confusion and false alarms,
thus we remove the redundant ERR_PTR rule initialization.
