powerpc/papr_scm: Add support for fetching nvdimm 'fuel-gauge' metric

We add support for reporting 'fuel-gauge' NVDIMM metric via
PAPR_PDSM_HEALTH pdsm payload. 'fuel-gauge' metric indicates the usage
life remaining of a papr-scm compatible NVDIMM. PHYP exposes this
metric via the H_SCM_PERFORMANCE_STATS.

The metric value is returned from the pdsm by extending the return
payload 'struct nd_papr_pdsm_health' without breaking the ABI. A new
field 'dimm_fuel_gauge' to hold the metric value is introduced at the
end of the payload struct and its presence is indicated by by
extension flag PDSM_DIMM_HEALTH_RUN_GAUGE_VALID.

The patch introduces a new function papr_pdsm_fuel_gauge() that is
called from papr_pdsm_health(). If fetching NVDIMM performance stats
is supported then 'papr_pdsm_fuel_gauge()' allocated an output buffer
large enough to hold the performance stat and passes it to
drc_pmem_query_stats() that issues the HCALL to PHYP. The return value
of the stat is then populated in the 'struct
nd_papr_pdsm_health.dimm_fuel_gauge' field with extension flag
'PDSM_DIMM_HEALTH_RUN_GAUGE_VALID' set in 'struct
nd_papr_pdsm_health.extension_flags'
