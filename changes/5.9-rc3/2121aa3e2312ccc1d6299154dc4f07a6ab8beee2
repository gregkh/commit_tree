mips: cdmm: Add mti,mips-cdmm dtb node support

Since having and mapping the CDMM block is platform specific, then
instead of just returning a zero-address, lets make the default CDMM
base address search method (mips_cdmm_phys_base()) to do something
useful. For instance to find the address in a dedicated dtb-node in
order to support of-based platforms by default.
