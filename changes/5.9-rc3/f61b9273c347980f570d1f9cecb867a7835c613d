ASoC: fsl_spdif: Add support for imx6sx platform

The one difference on imx6sx platform is that the root clock
is shared with ASRC module, so we add a new flags
"shared_root_clock" which means the root clock is not independent,
then we will not do the clk_set_rate and clk_round_rate to avoid
impact ASRC module usage.

As add a new flags, we include the soc specific data struct.
