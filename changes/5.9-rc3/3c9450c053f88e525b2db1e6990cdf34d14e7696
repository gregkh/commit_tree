powerpc/perf: Fix missing is_sier_aviable() during build

Compilation error:
  arch/powerpc/perf/perf_regs.c:80:undefined reference to `.is_sier_available'

Currently is_sier_available() is part of core-book3s.c, which is added
to build based on CONFIG_PPC_PERF_CTRS.

A config with CONFIG_PERF_EVENTS and without CONFIG_PPC_PERF_CTRS will
have a build break because of missing is_sier_available().

In practice it only breaks when CONFIG_FSL_EMB_PERF_EVENT=n because
that also guards the usage of is_sier_available(). That only happens
with CONFIG_PPC_BOOK3E_64=y and CONFIG_FSL_SOC_BOOKE=n.

Patch adds is_sier_available() in asm/perf_event.h to fix the build
break for configs missing CONFIG_PPC_PERF_CTRS.
