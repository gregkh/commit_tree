scsi: firmware: qcom_scm: Add support for programming inline crypto keys

Add support for the Inline Crypto Engine (ICE) key programming interface
that's needed for the ufs-qcom driver to use inline encryption on
Snapdragon SoCs.  This interface consists of two SCM calls: one to program
a key into a keyslot, and one to invalidate a keyslot.

Although the UFS specification defines a standard way to do this, on these
SoCs the Linux kernel isn't permitted to access the needed crypto
configuration registers directly; these SCM calls must be used instead.
