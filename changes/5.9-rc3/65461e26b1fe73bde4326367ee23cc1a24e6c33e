interconnect: Allow inter-provider pairs to be configured

This patch adds support for a new boolean 'inter_set' field in struct
icc_provider. Setting it to 'true' enables calling '->set' for
inter-provider node pairs. All existing users of the interconnect
framework allocate this structure with kzalloc, and are therefore
unaffected by this change.

This makes it easier for hierarchies like exynos-bus, where every bus
is probed separately and registers a separate interconnect provider, to
model constraints between buses.
