KVM: arm64: Handle calls to prefixed hyp functions

Once hyp functions are moved to a hyp object, they will have prefixed symbols.
This change declares and gets the address of the prefixed version for calls to
the hyp functions.

To aid migration, the hyp functions that have not yet moved have their prefixed
versions aliased to their non-prefixed version. This begins with all the hyp
functions being listed and will reduce to none of them once the migration is
complete.

        comments around symbol aliases.]
