gre6: Fix reception with IP6_TNL_F_RCV_DSCP_COPY

When receiving an IPv4 packet inside an IPv6 GRE packet, and the
IP6_TNL_F_RCV_DSCP_COPY flag is set on the tunnel, the IPv4 header would
get corrupted. This is due to the common ip6_tnl_rcv() function assuming
that the inner header is always IPv6. This patch checks the tunnel
protocol for IPv4 inner packets, but still defaults to IPv6.
