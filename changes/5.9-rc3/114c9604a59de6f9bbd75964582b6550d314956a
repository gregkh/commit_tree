arm64: dts: exynos: Remove generic arm,armv8-pmuv3 compatible

The ARM PMU node is described enough with first compatible so remove the
arm,armv8-pmuv3 to fix dtschema warnings like:

    arm-pmu: compatible: Additional items are not allowed ('arm,armv8-pmuv3' was unexpected)
    arm-pmu: compatible: ['arm,cortex-a57-pmu', 'arm,armv8-pmuv3'] is too long
