s390/pci: fix PF/VF linking on hot plug

Currently there are four places in which a PCI function is scanned
and made available to drivers:
 1. In pci_scan_root_bus() as part of the initial zbus
    creation.
 2. In zpci_bus_add_devices() when registering
    a device in configured state on a zbus that has already been
    scanned.
 3. When a function is already known to zPCI (in reserved/standby state)
    and configuration is triggered through firmware by PEC 0x301.
 4. When a device is already known to zPCI (in standby/reserved state)
    and configuration is triggered from within Linux using
    enable_slot().

The PF/VF linking step and setting of pdev->is_virtfn introduced with
commit e5794cf1a270 ("s390/pci: create links between PFs and VFs") was
only triggered for the second case, which is where VFs created through
sriov_numvfs usually land. However unlike some other platforms but like
POWER VFs can be individually enabled/disabled through
/sys/bus/pci/slots.

Fix this by doing VF setup as part of pcibios_bus_add_device() which is
called in all of the above cases.

Finally to remove the PF/VF links call the common code
pci_iov_remove_virtfn() function to remove linked VFs.
This takes care of the necessary sysfs cleanup.
