media: mach-pxa: palmz72/pcm990: remove soc_camera dependencies

The soc_camera driver is about to be removed, so drop camera
support from this board. Note that the soc_camera driver itself has
long since been deprecated and can't be compiled anymore (it depends
on BROKEN), so camera support on this board has been broken for a long
time (at least since 4.9 when the pxa_camera.c was removed from soc_camera).

Note that there is a new pxa_camera.c driver that replaced the old
soc_camera based driver, but using that would require these boards to
be converted to use the device tree.
