powerpc/perf: Update cpu_hw_event to use `struct` for storing MMCR registers

core-book3s currently uses array to store the MMCR registers as part
of per-cpu `cpu_hw_events`. This patch does a clean up to use `struct`
to store mmcr regs instead of array. This will make code easier to read
and reduces chance of any subtle bug that may come in the future, say
when new registers are added. Patch updates all relevant code that was
using MMCR array ( cpuhw->mmcr[x]) to use newly introduced `struct`.
This includes the PMU driver code for supported platforms (power5
to power9) and ISA macros for counter support functions.
