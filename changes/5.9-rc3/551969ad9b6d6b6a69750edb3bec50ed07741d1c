arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for Sony Xperia Z5 (SoMC Sumire-RoW)

Add device tree support for the Sony Xperia Z5 smartphone.
It's based on Sony Kitakami platform (msm8994) and hence
a Kitakami-common DTSI has been created so as to reduce
clutter when remaining devices are added.

The board currently supports
* Serial
* SDHCI
* I2C
* Regulator configuration
* pstore log dump
* GPIO keys
