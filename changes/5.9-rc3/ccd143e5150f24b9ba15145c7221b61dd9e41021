net: ena: Make missed_tx stat incremental

Most statistics in ena driver are incremented, meaning that a stat's
value is a sum of all increases done to it since driver/queue
initialization.

This patch makes all statistics this way, effectively making missed_tx
statistic incremental.
Also added a comment regarding rx_drops and tx_drops to make it
clearer how these counters are calculated.
