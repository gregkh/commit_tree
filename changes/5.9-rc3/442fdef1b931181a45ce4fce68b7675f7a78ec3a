serial: 8250_dw: Simplify the ref clock rate setting procedure

Really instead of twice checking the clk_round_rate() return value
we could do it once, and if it isn't error the clock rate can be changed.
By doing so we decrease a number of ret-value tests and remove a weird
goto-based construction implemented in the dw8250_set_termios() method.
