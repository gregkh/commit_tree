icmp: prepare rfc 4884 for ipv6

The RFC 4884 spec is largely the same between IPv4 and IPv6.
Factor out the IPv4 specific parts in preparation for IPv6 support:

- icmp types supported

- icmp header size, and thus offset to original datagram start

- datagram length field offset in icmp(6)hdr.

- datagram length field word size: 4B for IPv4, 8B for IPv6.
