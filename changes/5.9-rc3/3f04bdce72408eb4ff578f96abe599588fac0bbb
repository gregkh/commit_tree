drm/i915: Reboot CI if we get wedged during driver init

Getting wedged device on driver init is pretty much unrecoverable.
Since we're running various scenarios that may potentially hit this in
CI (module reload / selftests / hotunplug), and if it happens, it means
that we can't trust any subsequent CI results, we should just apply the
taint to let the CI know that it should reboot (CI checks taint between
test runs).

v2: Comment that WEDGED_ON_INIT is non-recoverable, distinguish
    WEDGED_ON_INIT from WEDGED_ON_FINI (Chris)
v3: Appease checkpatch, fixup search-replace logic expression mindbomb
    in assert (Chris)
