drm/ast: Move VRAM size detection to ast_mm.c

VRAM size detection is only relevant to the memory management. Move
the code into ast_mm.c.

While at it, rename the function to ast_get_vram_size(). The function
argument's type is now struct ast_private. The result is stored in a
local variable and not in struct ast_private any longer.
