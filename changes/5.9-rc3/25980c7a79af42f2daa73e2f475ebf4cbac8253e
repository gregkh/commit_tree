arch_topology, sched/core: Cleanup thermal pressure definition

The following commit:

  14533a16c46d ("thermal/cpu-cooling, sched/core: Move the arch_set_thermal_pressure() API to generic scheduler code")

moved the definition of arch_set_thermal_pressure() to sched/core.c, but
kept its declaration in linux/arch_topology.h. When building e.g. an x86
kernel with CONFIG_SCHED_THERMAL_PRESSURE=y, cpufreq_cooling.c ends up
getting the declaration of arch_set_thermal_pressure() from
include/linux/arch_topology.h, which is somewhat awkward.

On top of this, sched/core.c unconditionally defines
o The thermal_pressure percpu variable
o arch_set_thermal_pressure()

while arch_scale_thermal_pressure() does nothing unless redefined by the
architecture.

arch_*() functions are meant to be defined by architectures, so revert the
aforementioned commit and re-implement it in a way that keeps
arch_set_thermal_pressure() architecture-definable, and doesn't define the
thermal pressure percpu variable for kernels that don't need
it (CONFIG_SCHED_THERMAL_PRESSURE=n).
