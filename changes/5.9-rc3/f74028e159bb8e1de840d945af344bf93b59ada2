ASoC: tegra: Add Tegra210 based ADMAIF driver

ADMAIF is the interface between ADMA and AHUB. Each ADMA channel that
sends/receives data to/from AHUB must intreface through an ADMAIF channel.
ADMA channel sending data to AHUB pairs with an ADMAIF Tx channel and
similarly ADMA channel receiving data from AHUB pairs with an ADMAIF Rx
channel. Buffer size is configurable for each ADMAIF channel, but currently
SW uses default values.

This patch registers ADMAIF driver with ASoC framework. The component
driver exposes DAPM widgets, routes and kcontrols for the device. The DAI
driver exposes ADMAIF interfaces, which can be used to connect different
components in the ASoC layer. Makefile and Kconfig support is added to
allow to build the driver. The ADMAIF device can be enabled in the DT via
"nvidia,tegra210-admaif" compatible binding.

Tegra PCM driver is updated to expose required PCM interfaces and
snd_pcm_ops callbacks.
