audit: remove unused !CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL __audit_inode* stubs

Added 14 years ago in commit 73241ccca0f7 ("[PATCH] Collect more inode
information during syscall processing.") but never used however
needlessly churned no less than 10 times since.  Remove the unused
__audit_inode* stubs in the !CONFIG_AUDITSYSCALL case.
