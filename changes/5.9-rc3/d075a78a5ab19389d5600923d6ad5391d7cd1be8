tools/memory-model/README: Expand dependency of klitmus7

klitmus7 is independent of the memory model but depends on the
build-target kernel release.
It occasionally lost compatibility due to kernel API changes [1, 2, 3].
It was remedied in a backwards-compatible manner respectively [4, 5, 6].

Reflect this fact in README.

[1]: b899a850431e ("compiler.h: Remove ACCESS_ONCE()")
[2]: 0bb95f80a38f ("Makefile: Globally enable VLA warning")
[3]: d56c0d45f0e2 ("proc: decouple proc from VFS with "struct proc_ops"")
[4]: https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/commit/e87d7f9287d1
     ("klitmus: Use WRITE_ONCE and READ_ONCE in place of deprecated ACCESS_ONCE")
[5]: https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/commit/a0cbb10d02be
     ("klitmus: Avoid variable length array")
[6]: https://github.com/herd/herdtools7/commit/46b9412d3a58
     ("klitmus: Linux kernel v5.6.x compat")

NOTE: [5] was ahead of herdtools7 7.53, which did not make an
official release.  Code generated by klitmus7 without [5] can still be
built targeting Linux 4.20--5.5 if you don't care VLA warnings.
