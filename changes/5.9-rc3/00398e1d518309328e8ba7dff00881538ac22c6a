Bluetooth: Add support for BT_PKT_STATUS CMSG data for SCO connections

This change adds support for reporting the BT_PKT_STATUS to the socket
CMSG data to allow the implementation of a packet loss correction on
erroneous data received on the SCO socket.

The patch was partially developed by Marcel Holtmann and validated by
Hsin-yu Chao.
