dma-mapping: inline the fast path dma-direct calls

Inline the single page map/unmap/sync dma-direct calls into the now
out of line generic wrappers.  This restores the behavior of a single
function call that we had before moving the generic calls out of line.
Besides the dma-mapping callers there are just a few callers in IOMMU
drivers that have a bypass mode, and more of those are going to be
switched to the generic bypass soon.
