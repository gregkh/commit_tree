drm: use drm_dev_has_vblank more

For historical reasons it's called dev->num_crtcs, which is rather
confusing ever since kms was added. But now we have a nice helper, so
let's use it for better readability!

Only code change is in atomic helpers: vblank support means that
dev->irq_enabled must be set too. Another one of these quirky things
... But since it's implied we can simplify that check.
