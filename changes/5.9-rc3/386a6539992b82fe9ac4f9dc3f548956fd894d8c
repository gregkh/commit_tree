ALSA: hda - fix the micmute led status for Lenovo ThinkCentre AIO

After installing the Ubuntu Linux, the micmute led status is not
correct. Users expect that the led is on if the capture is disabled,
but with the current kernel, the led is off with the capture disabled.

We tried the old linux kernel like linux-4.15, there is no this issue.
It looks like we introduced this issue when switching to the led_cdev.
