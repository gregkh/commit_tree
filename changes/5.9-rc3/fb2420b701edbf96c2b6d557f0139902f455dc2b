drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: Fix disabling dithering

While we expose the ability to turn off hardware dithering for nouveau,
we actually make the mistake of turning it on anyway, due to
dithering_depth containing a non-zero value if our dithering depth isn't
also set to 6 bpc.

So, fix it by never enabling dithering when it's disabled.
