mmc: sdhci-of-arasan: fix timings allocation code

The initial code that was adding delays was doing a cast over undefined
memory. This meant that the delays would be all gibberish.

This change, allocates all delays on the stack, and assigns them from the
ZynqMP & Versal macros/phase-list. And then finally copies them over the
common iclk_phase & oclk_phase variables.
