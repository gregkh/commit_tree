KVM: arm64: Split hyp/debug-sr.c to VHE/nVHE

debug-sr.c contains KVM's code for context-switching debug registers, with some
code shared between VHE/nVHE. These common routines are moved to a header file,
VHE-specific code is moved to vhe/debug-sr.c and nVHE-specific code to
nvhe/debug-sr.c.

Functions are slightly refactored to move code hidden behind `has_vhe()` checks
to the corresponding .c files.
