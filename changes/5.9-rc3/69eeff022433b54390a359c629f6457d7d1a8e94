powerpc/32s: Remove TAUException wart in traps.c

All 32 and 64-bit builds that don't have CONFIG_TAU_INT enabled (all
of them), get a definition of TAUException() in traps.c.

On 64-bit it's completely useless, and just wastes ~120 bytes of text.
On 32-bit it allows the kernel to link because head_32.S calls it
unconditionally.

Instead follow the example of altivec_assist_exception(), and if
CONFIG_TAU_INT is not enabled just point it at unknown_exception using
the preprocessor.
