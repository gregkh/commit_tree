tty: Use the preferred form for passing the size of a structure type

Use the preferred form for passing the size of a structure type. The
alternative form where the structure type is spelled out hurts
readability and introduces an opportunity for a bug when the object
type is changed but the corresponding object identifier to which the
sizeof operator is applied is not.
