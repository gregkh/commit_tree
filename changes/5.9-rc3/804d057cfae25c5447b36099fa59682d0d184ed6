habanalabs: fix incorrect check on failed workqueue create

The null check on a failed workqueue create is currently null checking
hdev->cq_wq rather than the pointer hdev->cq_wq[i] and so the test
will never be true on a failed workqueue create. Fix this by checking
hdev->cq_wq[i].

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference before null check")
Fixes: 5574cb2194b1 ("habanalabs: Assign each CQ with its own work queue")
