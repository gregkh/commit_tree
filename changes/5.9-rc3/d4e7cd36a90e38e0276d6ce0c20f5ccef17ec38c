io_uring: sanitize double poll handling

There's a bit of confusion on the matching pairs of poll vs double poll,
depending on if the request is a pure poll (IORING_OP_POLL_ADD) or
poll driven retry.

Add io_poll_get_double() that returns the double poll waitqueue, if any,
and io_poll_get_single() that returns the original poll waitqueue. With
that, remove the argument to io_poll_remove_double().

Finally ensure that wait->private is cleared once the double poll handler
has run, so that remove knows it's already been seen.
