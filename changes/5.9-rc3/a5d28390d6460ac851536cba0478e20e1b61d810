ARM: dts: aspeed: cmm: Fixup I2C tree

Create all the i2c switches in device tree and use aliases to assign
child channels with consistent bus numbers.

Besides, "i2c-mux-idle-disconnect" is set for all the i2c switches to
avoid potential conflicts when multiple devices (beind the switches)
use the same device address.
