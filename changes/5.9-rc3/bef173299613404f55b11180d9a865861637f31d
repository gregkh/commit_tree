initrd: switch initrd loading to struct file based APIs

There is no good reason to mess with file descriptors from in-kernel
code, switch the initrd loading to struct file based read and writes
instead.

Also Pass an explicit offset instead of ->f_pos, and to make that easier,
use file scope file structs and offsets everywhere except for
identify_ramdisk_image instead of the current strange mix.
