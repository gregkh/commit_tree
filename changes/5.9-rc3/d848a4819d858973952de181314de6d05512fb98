remoteproc: Introducing function rproc_attach()

Introducing function rproc_attach() to enact the same actions as
rproc_start(), but without the steps related to the handling of
a firmware image.  That way we can properly deal with scenarios
where the remoteproc core needs to attach with a remote processsor
that has been booted by another entity.
