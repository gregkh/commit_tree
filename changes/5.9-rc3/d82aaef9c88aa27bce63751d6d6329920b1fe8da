KVM: nSVM: use nested_svm_load_cr3() on guest->host switch

Make nSVM code resemble nVMX where nested_vmx_load_cr3() is used on
both guest->host and host->guest transitions. Also, we can now
eliminate unconditional kvm_mmu_reset_context() and speed things up.

Note, nVMX has two different paths: load_vmcs12_host_state() and
nested_vmx_restore_host_state() and the later is used to restore from
'partial' switch to L2, it always uses kvm_mmu_reset_context().
nSVM doesn't have this yet. Also, nested_svm_vmexit()'s return value
is almost always ignored nowadays.
