ARM: 8992/1: Fix unwind_frame for clang-built kernels

Since clang does not push pc and sp in function prologues, the current
implementation of unwind_frame does not work. By using the previous
frame's lr/fp instead of saved pc/sp we get valid unwinds on clang-built
kernels.

The bounds check on next frame pointer must be changed as well since
there are 8 less bytes between frames.

This fixes /proc/<pid>/stack.
