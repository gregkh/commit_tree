net: fddi: skfp: smt: Remove seemingly unused variable 'ID_sccs'

This variable is present in many source files and has not been used
anywhere (at least internally) since it was introduced.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/net/fddi/skfp/smt.c:24:19: warning: ‘ID_sccs’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
