mux: adgs1408: Add mod_devicetable.h and remove of_match_ptr

Enables probing via the ACPI PRP0001 route but more is mostly about
removing examples of this that might get copied into new drivers.

Also fixes
  drivers/mux/adgs1408.c:112:34: warning: unused variable 'adgs1408_of_match
as has been reported recently.
