ASoC: AMD: Restore PME_EN state at Power On

PME_EN state needs to restored to the value set by fmw.
For the devices which are not using I2S wake event which gets
enabled by PME_EN bit, keeping PME_EN enabled burns considerable amount
of power as it blocks low power state.
For the devices using I2S wake event, PME_EN gets enabled in fmw and the
state should be maintained after ACP Power On.
