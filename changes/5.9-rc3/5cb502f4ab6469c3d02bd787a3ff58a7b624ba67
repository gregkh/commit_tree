btrfs: relocation: allow signal to cancel balance

Although btrfs balance can be canceled with "btrfs balance cancel"
command, it's still almost muscle memory to press Ctrl-C to cancel a
long running btrfs balance.

So allow btrfs balance to check signal to determine if it should exit.
The cancellation points are in known location and we're only adding one
more reason, so this should be safe.
