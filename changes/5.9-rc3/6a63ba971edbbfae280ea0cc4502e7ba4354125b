Revert "serial: amba-pl011: Make sure we initialize the port.lock spinlock"

This reverts commit 8508f4cba308f785b2fd4b8c38849c117b407297.

There has been a quick fix against uninitialised lock revealed by
the commit f743061a85f5 ("serial: core: Initialise spin lock before use
in uart_configure_port()"). Since we have now better fix in serial core,
this may be safely reverted.
