bnx2x: use generic power management

With legacy PM, drivers themselves were responsible for managing the
device's power states and takes care of register states.

After upgrading to the generic structure, PCI core will take care of
required tasks and drivers should do only device-specific operations.

The driver was also calling bnx2x_set_power_state() to set the power state
of the device by changing the device's registers' value. It is no more
needed.

Compile-tested only.
