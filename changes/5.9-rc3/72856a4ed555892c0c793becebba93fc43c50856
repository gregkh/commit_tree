clk: bcm: rpi: Use clk_hw_register for pllb_arm

The pllb_arm clock is defined as a fixed factor clock with the pllb
clock as a parent. However, all its configuration is entirely static,
and thus we don't really need to call clk_hw_register_fixed_factor() but
can simply call clk_hw_register() with a static clk_fixed_factor
structure.
