vdpa/mlx5: Avoid warnings about shifts on 32-bit platforms

Clang warns several times when building for 32-bit ARM along the lines
of:

drivers/vdpa/mlx5/net/mlx5_vnet.c:1462:31: warning: shift count >= width
of type [-Wshift-count-overflow]
                ndev->mvdev.mlx_features |= BIT(VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1);
                                            ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is related to the BIT macro, which uses an unsigned long literal,
which is 32-bit on ARM so having a shift equal to or larger than 32 will
cause this warning, such as the above, where VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1 is 32.
To avoid this, use BIT_ULL, which will be an unsigned long long. This
matches the size of the features field throughout this driver, which is
u64 so there should be no functional change.
