clk: rockchip: Handle clock tree for rk3288w variant

The revision rk3288w has a different clock tree about "hclk_vio"
clock, according to the BSP kernel code.

This patch handles this difference by detecting which device-tree
we are using. If it is a "rockchip,rk3288-cru", let's register
the clock tree as it was before. If the device-tree node is
"rockchip,rk3288w-cru", we will apply the difference with this
version of this SoC.

Noticed that this new device-tree compatible must be handled in
bootloader such as u-boot.
