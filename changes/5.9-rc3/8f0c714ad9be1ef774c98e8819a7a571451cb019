media: staging: tegra-vde: Turn ON power domain on shutdown

On some devices bootloader isn't ready to a clamped VDE power, and thus,
machine hangs on a warm reboot (CPU reset). The VDE power partition is
turned ON by default on a cold boot, hence VDE driver should keep power
partition enabled on system's reboot too. This fixes hang on a warm reboot
on a Tegra20 Acer A500 device, which is handy if Embedded Controller
driver is unavailable, i.e. cold reboot can't be performed.
