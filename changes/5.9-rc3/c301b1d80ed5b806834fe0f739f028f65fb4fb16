perf/x86/intel/lbr: Add a function pointer for LBR read

The method to read Architectural LBRs is different from previous
model-specific LBR. Perf has to implement a different function.

A function pointer for LBR read is introduced. Perf should initialize
the corresponding function at boot time, and avoid checking lbr_format
at run time.

The current 64-bit LBR read function is set as default.
