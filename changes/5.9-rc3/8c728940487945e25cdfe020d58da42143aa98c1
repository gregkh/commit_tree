mptcp: silence warning in subflow_data_ready()

since commit d47a72152097 ("mptcp: fix race in subflow_data_ready()"), it
is possible to observe a regression in MP_JOIN kselftests. For sockets in
TCP_CLOSE state, it's not sufficient to just wake up the main socket: we
also need to ensure that received data are made available to the reader.
Silence the WARN_ON_ONCE() in these cases: it preserves the syzkaller fix
and restores kselftests	when they are ran as follows:

  # while true; do
  > make KBUILD_OUTPUT=/tmp/kselftest TARGETS=net/mptcp kselftest
  > done
