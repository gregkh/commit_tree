initrd: Remove erroneous comment

Most architectures have been passing the location of an initrd via the
initrd= option since their inception.  Remove the comment as it's both
wrong and unrelated to the commit that introduced it.

For a bit more context, I assume there's been some confusion between
"initrd" being a keyword in things like extlinux.conf and also that for
quite a long time now initrd information is passed via device tree and
not the command line on relevant architectures. But it's still true that
it's been a valid command line option to the kernel since the 90s. It's
just the case that in 2018 the code was consolidated from under arch/
and in to this file.

 [ bp: Move the context clarification up into the commit message proper. ]
