thermal: qcom: tsens-v0_1: Add support for MSM8939

The TSENS integrated on MSM8939 is a v0_1 device with 10 sensors.
Different from its predecessor MSM8916, where 'calib_sel' bits sit in
separate qfprom word, MSM8939 has 'cailb' and 'calib_sel' bits mixed and
spread on discrete offsets.  That's why all qfprom bits are read as one
go and later mapped to calibration data for MSM8939.
