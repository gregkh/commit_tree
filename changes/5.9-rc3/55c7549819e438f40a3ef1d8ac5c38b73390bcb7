scripts: add dummy report mode to add_namespace.cocci

When running `make coccicheck` in report mode using the
add_namespace.cocci file, it will fail for files that contain
MODULE_LICENSE. Those match the replacement precondition, but spatch
errors out as virtual.ns is not set.

In order to fix that, add the virtual rule nsdeps and only do search and
replace if that rule has been explicitly requested.

In order to make spatch happy in report mode, we also need a dummy rule,
as otherwise it errors out with "No rules apply". Using a script:python
rule appears unrelated and odd, but this is the shortest I could come up
with.

Adjust scripts/nsdeps accordingly to set the nsdeps rule when run trough
`make nsdeps`.
