MIPS: checksum: fix sparse flooding on asm/checksum.h

csum_fold() in MIPS' asm/checksum.h is another source of sparse flooding
when building different networking source code.
The thing is that only half of __wsum <--> u32 casts inside the function
is forced, which is insufficient.
Add all necessary forced typecasting to stop floods and simplify actual
bug hunting.
