Revert "serial: sunhv: Initialize lock for non-registered console"

This reverts commit 0f87aa66e8c314f95c00eeff978c8a0b41e05d50.

There has been a quick fix against uninitialised lock revealed by
the commit f743061a85f5 ("serial: core: Initialise spin lock before use
in uart_configure_port()"). Since we have now better fix in serial core,
this may be safely reverted.
