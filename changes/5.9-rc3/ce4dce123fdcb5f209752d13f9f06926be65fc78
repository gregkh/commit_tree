rcu: Introduce 2 arg kvfree_rcu() interface

kvmalloc() can allocate two types of objects: SLAB backed
and vmalloc backed. How it behaves depends on requested
object's size and memory pressure.

Add a kvfree_rcu() interface that can free memory allocated
via kvmalloc(). It is a simple alias to kfree_rcu() which
can now handle either type of object.

<snip>
    struct test_kvfree_rcu {
        struct rcu_head rcu;
        unsigned char array[100];
    };

    struct test_kvfree_rcu *p;

    p = kvmalloc(10 * PAGE_SIZE);
    if (p)
        kvfree_rcu(p, rcu);
