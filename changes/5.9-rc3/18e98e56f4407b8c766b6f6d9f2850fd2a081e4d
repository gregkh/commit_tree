mm: cma: fix the name of CMA areas

Patch series "mm: fix the names of general cma and hugetlb cma", v2.

The current code of CMA can only work when users pass a const string as
name parameter.  we need to fix the way to handle names in CMA.  On the
other hand, to avoid name conflicts after enabling CMA_DEBUGFS, each
hugetlb should get a different CMA name.

This patch (of 2):

If users give a name saved in stack, the current code will generate magic
pointer.  if users don't give a name(NULL), kasprintf() will always return
NULL as we are at the early stage.  that means cma_init_reserved_mem()
will return -ENOMEM if users set name parameter as NULL.
