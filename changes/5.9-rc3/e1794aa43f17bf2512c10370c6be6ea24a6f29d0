regulator: core: Add destroy_regulator()

Part of the regulator_get() code is already factored out into
create_regulator(). This patch factors out some of the regulator_put()
code into destroy_regulator() so that create_regulator() has a
corresponding unwind function. Subsequent patches will use this
function.
