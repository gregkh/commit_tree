clk: rockchip: Revert "fix wrong mmc sample phase shift for rk3328"

This reverts commit 82f4b67f018c88a7cc9337f0067ed3d6ec352648.

According to a subsequent revert in the vendor kernel, the original
change was based on unclear documentation and was in fact incorrect.

Emprically, my board's HS200 eMMC at 200MHZ apparently gets lucky with a
phase where this had no impact, but limiting max-frequency to 150MHz to
match the nominal capability of the I/O pins made it virtually unusable,
constantly throwing errors and retuning. With this revert, it starts
behaving perfectly at 150MHz too.
