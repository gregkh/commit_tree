net: ethernet: stmmac: Disable hardware multicast filter

The IPQ806x does not appear to have a functional multicast ethernet
address filter. This was observed as a failure to correctly receive IPv6
packets on a LAN to the all stations address. Checking the vendor driver
shows that it does not attempt to enable the multicast filter and
instead falls back to receiving all multicast packets, internally
setting ALLMULTI.

Use the new fallback support in the dwmac1000 driver to correctly
achieve the same with the mainline IPQ806x driver. Confirmed to fix IPv6
functionality on an RB3011 router.
