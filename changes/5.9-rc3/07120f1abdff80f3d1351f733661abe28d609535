xfs: Add xfs_has_attr and subroutines

This patch adds a new functions to check for the existence of an
attribute. Subroutines are also added to handle the cases of leaf
blocks, nodes or shortform. Common code that appears in existing attr
add and remove functions have been factored out to help reduce the
appearance of duplicated code.  We will need these routines later for
delayed attributes since delayed operations cannot return error codes.
