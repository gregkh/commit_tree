arm64: dts: renesas: r8a774a1-hihope-rzg2m[-ex/-ex-idk-1110wr]: Rename HiHope RZ/G2M boards

The existing DTS files for HiHope RZ/G2M boards are for Rev.2.0 version
so reflect the same for the DTS file names so that the existing naming
convention can be used for Rev.3.0/4.0 boards.

While at it also added a comment about switch SW43 to be OFF for pciec1
to be activated.
