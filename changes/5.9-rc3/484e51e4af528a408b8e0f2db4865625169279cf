mm/xtensa: use general page fault accounting

Use the general page fault accounting by passing regs into
handle_mm_fault().  It naturally solve the issue of multiple page fault
accounting when page fault retry happened.

Remove the PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS_[MAJ|MIN] perf events because it's
now also done in handle_mm_fault().

Move the PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS event higher before taking mmap_sem for
the fault, then it'll match with the rest of the archs.
