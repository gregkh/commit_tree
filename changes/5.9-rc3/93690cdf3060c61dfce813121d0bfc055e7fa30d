leds: trigger: add support for LED-private device triggers

Some LED controllers may come with an internal HW triggering mechanism
for the LED and the ability to switch between SW control and the
internal HW control. This includes most PHYs, various ethernet switches,
the Turris Omnia LED controller or AXP20X PMIC.

This adds support for registering such triggers.
