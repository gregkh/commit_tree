powerpc/book3s64/pkeys: Use PVR check instead of cpu feature

We are wrongly using CPU_FTRS_POWER8 to check for P8 support. Instead, we should
use PVR value. Now considering we are using CPU_FTRS_POWER8, that
implies we returned true for P9 with older firmware. Keep the same behavior
by checking for P9 PVR value.
