tpm_ftpm_tee: register driver on TEE bus

OP-TEE based fTPM Trusted Application depends on tee-supplicant to
provide NV RAM implementation based on RPMB secure storage. So this
dependency can be resolved via TEE bus where we only invoke fTPM
driver probe once fTPM device is registered on the bus which is only
true after the tee-supplicant is up and running. Additionally, TEE bus
provides auto device enumeration.
