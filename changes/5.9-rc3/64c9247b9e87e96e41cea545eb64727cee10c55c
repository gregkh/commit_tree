clk: at91: clk-generated: pass the id of changeable parent at registration

Pass the ID of changeable parent at registration. This will allow
the scalability of this clock driver with regards to the changeable
parent ID for versions of this IP where changeable parent is not the
last one in the parents list (e.g. SAMA7G5). With this the clock flags
are set to zero in case we have no changeable parent. Also in
clk_generated_best_diff() the *best_diff variable is check against
tmp_diff variable using ">=" operator instead of ">" so that in case
the requested frequency could be obtained using fix parents + gck
dividers but the clock also supports changeable parent to be able
to force the usage of the changeable parent.
