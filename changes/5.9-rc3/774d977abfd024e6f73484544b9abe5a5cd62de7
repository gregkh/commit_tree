net: dsa: b53: check for timeout

clang static analysis reports this problem

b53_common.c:1583:13: warning: The left expression of the compound
  assignment is an uninitialized value. The computed value will
  also be garbage
        ent.port &= ~BIT(port);
        ~~~~~~~~ ^

ent is set by a successful call to b53_arl_read().  Unsuccessful
calls are caught by an switch statement handling specific returns.
b32_arl_read() calls b53_arl_op_wait() which fails with the
unhandled -ETIMEDOUT.

So add -ETIMEDOUT to the switch statement.  Because
b53_arl_op_wait() already prints out a message, do not add another
one.
