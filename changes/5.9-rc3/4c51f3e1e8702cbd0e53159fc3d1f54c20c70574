powerpc/powernv/sriov: Make single PE mode a per-BAR setting

Using single PE BARs to map an SR-IOV BAR is really a choice about what
strategy to use when mapping a BAR. It doesn't make much sense for this to
be a global setting since a device might have one large BAR which needs to
be mapped with single PE windows and another smaller BAR that can be mapped
with a regular segmented window. Make the segmented vs single decision a
per-BAR setting and clean up the logic that decides which mode to use.
