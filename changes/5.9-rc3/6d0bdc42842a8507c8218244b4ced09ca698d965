USB: serial: ch341: fix missing simulated-break margin

On devices which do not support break signalling a break condition is
simulated by sending a NUL byte at the lowest possible speed. The break
condition will be 9 bit periods long (start bit and eight data bits),
but the transmission itself also includes the stop bit.

Add the missing safety margin of one bit which is intended to account
for timing differences, and fix up the corresponding comment.
