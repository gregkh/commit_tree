perf bench: Add benchmark of find_next_bit

for_each_set_bit, or similar functions like for_each_cpu, may be hot
within the kernel. If many bits were set then one could imagine on Intel
a "bt" instruction with every bit may be faster than the function call
and word length find_next_bit logic. Add a benchmark to measure this.

This benchmark on AMD rome and Intel skylakex shows "bt" is not a good
option except for very small bitmaps.
