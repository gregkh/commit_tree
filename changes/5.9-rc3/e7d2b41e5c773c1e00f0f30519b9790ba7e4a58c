crypto: ecdh - check validity of Z before export

SP800-56A rev3 section 5.7.1.2 step 2 mandates that the validity of the
calculated shared secret is verified before the data is returned to the
caller. Thus, the export function and the validity check functions are
reversed. In addition, the sensitive variables of priv and rand_z are
zeroized.
