io_uring: retain iov_iter state over io_read/io_write calls

Instead of maintaining (and setting/remembering) iov_iter size and
segment counts, just put the iov_iter in the async part of the IO
structure.

This is mostly a preparation patch for doing appropriate internal retries
for short reads, but it also cleans up the state handling nicely and
simplifies it quite a bit.
