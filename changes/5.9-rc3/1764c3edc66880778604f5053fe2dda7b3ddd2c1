arm64: use a common .arch preamble for inline assembly

Commit 7c78f67e9bd9 ("arm64: enable tlbi range instructions") breaks
LLVM's integrated assembler, because -Wa,-march is only passed to
external assemblers and therefore, the new instructions are not enabled
when IAS is used.

This change adds a common architecture version preamble, which can be
used in inline assembly blocks that contain instructions that require
a newer architecture version, and uses it to fix __TLBI_0 and __TLBI_1
with ARM64_TLB_RANGE.
