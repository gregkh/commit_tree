x86/xen: remove 32-bit Xen PV guest support

Xen is requiring 64-bit machines today and since Xen 4.14 it can be
built without 32-bit PV guest support. There is no need to carry the
burden of 32-bit PV guest support in the kernel any longer, as new
guests can be either HVM or PVH, or they can use a 64 bit kernel.

Remove the 32-bit Xen PV support from the kernel.
