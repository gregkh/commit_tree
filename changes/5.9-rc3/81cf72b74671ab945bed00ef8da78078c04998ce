prism54: islpci_hotplug: use generic power management

Drivers using legacy power management .suspen()/.resume() callbacks
have to manage PCI states and device's PM states themselves. They also
need to take care of standard configuration registers.

Switch to generic power management framework using a single
"struct dev_pm_ops" variable to take the unnecessary load from the driver.
This also avoids the need for the driver to directly call most of the PCI
helper functions and device power state control functions as through
the generic framework, PCI Core takes care of the necessary operations,
and drivers are required to do only device-specific jobs.
