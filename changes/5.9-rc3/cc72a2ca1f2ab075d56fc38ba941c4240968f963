USB: phy: fsl-usb: remove sysfs abuse

This file has a HUGE debugging sysfs file that spews out a lot of
information all at once, which violates the one-value-per-file rule for
sysfs.  If this is really needed, it should go into debugfs, but given
the age of this driver, I strongly doubt anyone is using it anymore.

So just remove the file entirely, it was never documented, so obviously,
no one actually needed it :)
