KVM: arm: Add trace name for ARM_NISV

Commit c726200dd106d ("KVM: arm/arm64: Allow reporting non-ISV data aborts
to userspace") introduced a mechanism to deflect MMIO traffic the kernel
can not handle to user space. For that, it introduced a new exit reason.

However, it did not update the trace point array that gives human readable
names to these exit reasons inside the trace log.

Let's fix that up after the fact, so that trace logs are pretty even when
we get user space MMIO traps on ARM.
