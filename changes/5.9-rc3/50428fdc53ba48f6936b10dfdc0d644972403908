powerpc: Add a ppc_inst_as_str() helper

There are quite a few places where instructions are printed, this is
done using a '%x' format specifier. With the introduction of prefixed
instructions, this does not work well. Currently in these places,
ppc_inst_val() is used for the value for %x so only the first word of
prefixed instructions are printed.

When the instructions are word instructions, only a single word should
be printed. For prefixed instructions both the prefix and suffix should
be printed. To accommodate both of these situations, instead of a '%x'
specifier use '%s' and introduce a helper, __ppc_inst_as_str() which
returns a char *. The char * __ppc_inst_as_str() returns is buffer that
is passed to it by the caller.

It is cumbersome to require every caller of __ppc_inst_as_str() to now
declare a buffer. To make it more convenient to use __ppc_inst_as_str(),
wrap it in a macro that uses a compound statement to allocate a buffer
on the caller's stack before calling it.
