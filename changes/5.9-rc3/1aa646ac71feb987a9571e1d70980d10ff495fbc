l2tp: don't BUG_ON session magic checks in l2tp_ppp

checkpatch advises that WARN_ON and recovery code are preferred over
BUG_ON which crashes the kernel.

l2tp_ppp.c's BUG_ON checks of the l2tp session structure's "magic" field
occur in code paths where it's reasonably easy to recover:

 * In the case of pppol2tp_sock_to_session, we can return NULL and the
   caller will bail out appropriately.  There is no change required to
   any of the callsites of this function since they already handle
   pppol2tp_sock_to_session returning NULL.

 * In the case of pppol2tp_session_destruct we can just avoid
   decrementing the reference count on the suspect session structure.
   In the worst case scenario this results in a memory leak, which is
   preferable to a crash.

Convert these uses of BUG_ON to WARN_ON accordingly.
