powerpc/rtasd: simplify handle_rtas_event(), emit message on events

prrn_is_enabled() always returns false/0, so handle_rtas_event() can
be simplified and some dead code can be removed. Use machine_is()
instead of #ifdef to run this code only on pseries, and add an
informational ratelimited message that we are ignoring the
events. PRRN events are relatively rare in normal operation and
usually arise from operator-initiated actions such as a DPO (Dynamic
Platform Optimizer) run.

Eventually we do want to consume these events and update the device
tree, but that needs more care to be safe vs LPM and DLPAR.
