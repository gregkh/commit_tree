serial: samsung: Minor whitespace cleanups

Make the code slightly more readable by removing unneeded line breaks,
adding missing line breaks and white spaces.  This also fixes few strict
checkpatch suggestions:

	CHECK: spaces preferred around that '-' (ctx:VxV)
	CHECK: Unbalanced braces around else statement
	CHECK: Lines should not end with a '('
