fsl/fman: use 32-bit unsigned integer

Potentially overflowing expression (ts_freq << 16 and intgr << 16)
declared as type u32 (32-bit unsigned) is evaluated using 32-bit
arithmetic and then used in a context that expects an expression of
type u64 (64-bit unsigned) which ultimately is used as 16-bit
unsigned by typecasting to u16. Fixed by using an unsigned 32-bit
integer since the value is truncated anyway in the end.
