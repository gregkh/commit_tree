net: qrtr: fix usage of idr in port assignment to socket

Passing large uint32 sockaddr_qrtr.port numbers for port allocation
triggers a warning within idr_alloc() since the port number is cast
to int, and thus interpreted as a negative number. This leads to
the rejection of such valid port numbers in qrtr_port_assign() as
idr_alloc() fails.

To avoid the problem, switch to idr_alloc_u32() instead.
