drm/i915: Identify Cometlake platform

Cometlake is a small refresh of Coffeelake, but since we have found out a
difference in the plaforms, we need to identify them as separate platforms.

Since we previously took Coffeelake/Cometlake as identical, update all
IS_COFFEELAKE() to also include IS_COMETLAKE().
