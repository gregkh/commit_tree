io_uring: kill REQ_F_LINK_NEXT

After pulling nxt from a request, it's no more a links head, so clear
REQ_F_LINK_HEAD. Absence of this flag also indicates that there are no
linked requests, so replacing REQ_F_LINK_NEXT, which can be killed.

Linked timeouts also behave leaving the flag intact when necessary.
