vhost-vdpa: support IOTLB batching hints

This patches extend the vhost IOTLB API to accept batch updating hints
form userspace. When userspace wants update the device IOTLB in a
batch, it may do:

1) Write vhost_iotlb_msg with VHOST_IOTLB_BATCH_BEGIN flag
2) Perform a batch of IOTLB updating via VHOST_IOTLB_UPDATE/INVALIDATE
3) Write vhost_iotlb_msg with VHOST_IOTLB_BATCH_END flag

Vhost-vdpa may decide to batch the IOMMU/IOTLB updating in step 3 when
vDPA device support set_map() ops. This is useful for the vDPA device
that want to know all the mappings to tweak their own DMA translation
logic.

For vDPA device that doesn't require set_map(), no behavior changes.

This capability is advertised via VHOST_BACKEND_F_IOTLB_BATCH capability.
