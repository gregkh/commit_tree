rcutorture: Add races with task-exit processing

Several variants of Linux-kernel RCU interact with task-exit processing,
including preemptible RCU, Tasks RCU, and Tasks Trace RCU.  This commit
therefore adds testing of this interaction to rcutorture by adding
rcutorture.read_exit_burst and rcutorture.read_exit_delay kernel-boot
parameters.  These kernel parameters control the frequency and spacing
of special read-then-exit kthreads that are spawned.
