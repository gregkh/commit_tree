docs: networking: reorganize driver documentation again

Organize driver documentation by device type. Most documents
have fairly verbose yet uninformative names, so let users
first select a well defined device type, and then search for
a particular driver.

While at it rename the section from Vendor drivers to
Hardware drivers. This seems more accurate, besides people
sometimes refer to out-of-tree drivers as vendor drivers.
