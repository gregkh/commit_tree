ALSA: hda/tegra: Disable sync-write operation

Commit f34a4c9dd4ca ("ALSA: hda: Enable sync-write operation as default
for all controllers") enabled sync-write for all controllers and this is
causing audio playback on the Tegra186 HDA device to fail. For now,
disable sync-write support for Tegra to fix this.
