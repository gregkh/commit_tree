fanotify: distinguish between fid encode error and null fid

In fanotify_encode_fh(), both cases of NULL inode and failure to encode
ended up with fh type FILEID_INVALID.

Distiguish the case of NULL inode, by setting fh type to FILEID_ROOT.
This is just a semantic difference at this point.

Remove stale comment and unneeded check from fid event compare helpers.
