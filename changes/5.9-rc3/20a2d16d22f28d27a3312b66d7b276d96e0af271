staging: octeon: Add the license identifier

This patch fixes the checkpatch.pl warning:
WARNING: Missing or malformed SPDX-License-Identifier tag

Add a the SPDX-License-Identifier tag on line 1

Other files in this folder have GPL-2.0 license. So this file should
have the same license which was missing before and checkpatch.pl was
giving the warning.
