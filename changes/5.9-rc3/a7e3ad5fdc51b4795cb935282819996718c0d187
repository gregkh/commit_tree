drm/vblank: Use spin_(un)lock_irq() in drm_crtc_vblank_off()

This got me confused for a bit while looking over this code: I had been
planning on adding some blocking function calls into this function, but
seeing the irqsave/irqrestore variants of spin_(un)lock() didn't make it
very clear whether or not that would actually be safe.

So I went ahead and reviewed every single driver in the kernel that uses
this function, and they all fall into three categories:

* Driver probe code
* ->atomic_disable() callbacks
* Legacy modesetting callbacks

All of these will be guaranteed to have IRQs enabled, which means it's
perfectly safe to block here. Just to make things a little less
confusing to others in the future, let's switch over to
spin_lock_irq()/spin_unlock_irq() to make that fact a little more
obvious.
