kcsan: fix a kernel-doc warning

One of the kernel-doc markups there have two "note" sections:

	./include/linux/kcsan-checks.h:346: warning: duplicate section name 'Note'

While this is not the case here, duplicated sections can cause
build issues on Sphinx. So, let's change the notes section
to use, instead, a list for those 2 notes at the same function.
