VFAT/FAT/MSDOS FILESYSTEM: replace HTTP links with HTTPS ones

Rationale:
Reduces attack surface on kernel devs opening the links for MITM
as HTTPS traffic is much harder to manipulate.

Deterministic algorithm:
For each file:
  If not .svg:
    For each line:
      If doesn't contain `xmlns`:
        For each link, `http://[^# 	]*(?:\w|/)`:
	  If neither `gnu\.org/license`, nor `mozilla\.org/MPL`:
            If both the HTTP and HTTPS versions
            return 200 OK and serve the same content:
              Replace HTTP with HTTPS.
