mm/ia64: use general page fault accounting

Use the general page fault accounting by passing regs into
handle_mm_fault().  It naturally solve the issue of multiple page fault
accounting when page fault retry happened.

Add the missing PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS perf events too.  Note, the
other two perf events (PERF_COUNT_SW_PAGE_FAULTS_[MAJ|MIN]) were done in
handle_mm_fault().
