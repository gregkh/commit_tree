scsi: block: pm: Simplify resume handling

Commit 05d18ae1cc8a ("scsi: pm: Balance pm_only counter of request queue
during system resume") fixed a problem in the block layer's runtime-PM
code: blk_set_runtime_active() failed to call blk_clear_pm_only().
However, the commit's implementation was awkward; it forced the SCSI
system-resume handler to choose whether to call blk_post_runtime_resume()
or blk_set_runtime_active(), depending on whether or not the SCSI device
had previously been runtime suspended.

This patch simplifies the situation considerably by adding the missing
function call directly into blk_set_runtime_active() (under the condition
that the queue is not already in the RPM_ACTIVE state).  This allows the
SCSI routine to revert back to its original form.  Furthermore, making this
change reveals that blk_post_runtime_resume() (in its success pathway) does
exactly the same thing as blk_set_runtime_active().  The duplicate code is
easily removed by making one routine call the other.

No functional changes are intended.
