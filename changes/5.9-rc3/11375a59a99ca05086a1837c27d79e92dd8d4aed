cifs: only update prefix path of DFS links in cifs_tree_connect()

For DFS root mounts that contain a prefix path, do not change them
after failover.

E.g., if the user mounts

	//srvA/root/dir1

and then lost connection to srvA, it will reconnect to

	//srvB/root/dir1

In case of DFS links, which may resolve to different prefix paths
depending on their list of targets, the following must be supported:

	- mount //srvA/root/link/bar
	- connect to //srvA/share
	- set prefix path to "bar"
	- lost connection to srvA
	- reconnect to next target: //srvB/share/foo
	- set new prefix path to "foo/bar"

In cifs_tree_connect(), check the server_type field of the cached DFS
referral to determine whether or not prefix path should be updated.
