KVM: x86/mmu: Don't put invalid SPs back on the list of active pages

Delete a shadow page from the invalidation list instead of throwing it
back on the list of active pages when it's a root shadow page with
active users.  Invalid active root pages will be explicitly freed by
mmu_free_root_page() when the root_count hits zero, i.e. they don't need
to be put on the active list to avoid leakage.

Use sp->role.invalid to detect that a shadow page has already been
zapped, i.e. is not on a list.

WARN if an invalid page is encountered when zapping pages, as it should
now be impossible.
