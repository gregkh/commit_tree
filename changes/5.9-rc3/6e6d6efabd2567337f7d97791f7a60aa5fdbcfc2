sched,psci: Convert to sched_set_fifo*()

Because SCHED_FIFO is a broken scheduler model (see previous patches)
take away the priority field, the kernel can't possibly make an
informed decision.

Effectively changes prio from 99 to 50.

XXX this thing is horrific, it basically open-codes a stop-machine and
idle.
