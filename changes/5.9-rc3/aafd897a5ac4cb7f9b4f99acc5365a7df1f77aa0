ARM: dts: am335x-boneblack: add gpio-line-names

The BeagleBone Black has P8 and P9 headers [0] which expose many of the
AM3358 ZCZ SoC balls to stacking expansion boards called "capes", or to
other external connections like jumper wires connected to a breadboard.
BeagleBone users will often refer to the "Cape Exanpsion Headers" pin
diagram [1] as it is in the "Bone101" getting started tutorial. [2]

Most of the P8 and P9 header pins can muxed to a GPIO line.  The
gpio-line-names describe which P8 or P9 pin that line goes to and the
default mux for that P8 or P9 pin if it is not GPIO.

For example, gpiochip 1 line 0 is connected to P8 header pin 25 (P8_25)
however the default device tree has the corresponding BGA ball (ZCZ U7)
muxed to mmc1_dat0 as it is used for the on-board eMMC chip.  For that
GPIO line to be used, one would need to modify the device tree to
disable the eMMC and change the pin mux for that ball to GPIO mode.

Some of the AM3358 ZCZ balls corresponding to GPIO lines are not routed
to a P8 or P9 header, but are instead wired to some peripheral device
like on-board eMMC, HDMI framer IC, or status LEDs.  Those names are in
brackets to denote those GPIO lines can not be used.

Some GPIO lines are named "[NC]" as the corresponding balls are not
routed to anything on the PCB.

The goal for these names is to make it easier for a user viewing the
output of gpioinfo to determine which P8 or P9 pin is connected to a
GPIO line.  The output of gpioinfo on a BeagleBone Black would be:
