scsi: iscsi: Optimize work queue flush use

There is no need for one session to flush the entire iscsi_eh_timer_workq
when removing/unblocking a session. During removal we need to make sure our
works are not running anymore. And iscsi_unblock_session only needs to make
sure its work is done. The unblock work function will flush/cancel the
works it has conflicts with.
