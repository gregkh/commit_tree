drm/amd/sriov skip vcn powergating and dec_ring_test

1.Skip decode_ring test in VF, because VCN in SRIOV does not
support direct register read/write.

2.Skip powergating configuration in hw fini because
VCN3.0 SRIOV doesn't support powergating.

V2: delete unneccessary white lines and refine implementation.
