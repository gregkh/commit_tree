regulator: gpio: Honor regulator-boot-on property

When requesting the enable GPIO, the driver should do so with the
correct output level matching some expected state. This is especially
important if the regulator is a critical one, such as a supply for
the boot CPU. This is currently done by checking for the enable-at-boot
property, but this is not documented in the device tree binding, nor
does it match the common regulator properties.

Honor the common regulator-boot-on property by checking the boot_on
constraint setting within the DT probe path. This is the same as what
is done in the fixed regulator driver.

Also add a comment stating that the enable-at-boot property should not
be used.
