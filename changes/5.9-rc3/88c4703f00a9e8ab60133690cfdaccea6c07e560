btrfs: open-code remount flag setting in btrfs_remount

When we're (re)mounting a btrfs filesystem we set the
BTRFS_FS_STATE_REMOUNTING state in fs_info to serialize against async
reclaim or defrags.

This flag is set in btrfs_remount_prepare() called by btrfs_remount().
As btrfs_remount_prepare() does nothing but setting this flag and
doesn't have a second caller, we can just open-code the flag setting in
btrfs_remount().

Similarly do for so clearing of the flag by moving it out of
btrfs_remount_cleanup() into btrfs_remount() to be symmetrical.
