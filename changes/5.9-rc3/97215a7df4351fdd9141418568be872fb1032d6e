iommu/renesas: Expand COMPILE_TEST coverage

This driver shouldn't need anything architecture-specific (that isn't
under CONFIG_ARM protection already), and has already been accessible
from certain x86 configurations by virtue of the previously-cleaned-up
"ARM || IOMMU_DMA" dependency. Allow COMPILE_TEST for all architectures.
