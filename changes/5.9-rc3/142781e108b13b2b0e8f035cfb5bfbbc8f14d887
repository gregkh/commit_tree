entry: Provide generic syscall entry functionality

On syscall entry certain work needs to be done:

   - Establish state (lockdep, context tracking, tracing)
   - Conditional work (ptrace, seccomp, audit...)

This code is needlessly duplicated and  different in all
architectures.

Provide a generic version based on the x86 implementation which has all the
RCU and instrumentation bits right.

As interrupt/exception entry from user space needs parts of the same
functionality, provide a function for this as well.

syscall_enter_from_user_mode() and irqentry_enter_from_user_mode() must be
called right after the low level ASM entry. The calling code must be
non-instrumentable. After the functions returns state is correct and the
subsequent functions can be instrumented.
