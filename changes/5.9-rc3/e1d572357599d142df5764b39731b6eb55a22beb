Bluetooth: Configure controller address resolution if available

When the LL Privacy support is available, then as part of enabling or
disabling passive background scanning, it is required to set up the
controller based address resolution as well.

Since only passive background scanning is utilizing the whitelist, the
address resolution is now bound to the whitelist and passive background
scanning. All other resolution can be easily done by the host stack.
