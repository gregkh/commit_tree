io_uring: get rid of kiocb_wait_page_queue_init()

The 5.9 merge moved this function io_uring, which means that we don't
need to retain the generic nature of it. Clean up this part by removing
redundant checks, and just inlining the small remainder in
io_rw_should_retry().

No functional changes in this patch.
