bnxt_en: Fill HW RSS table from the RSS logical indirection table.

Now that we have the logical table, we can fill the HW RSS table
using the logical table's entries and converting them to the HW
specific format.  Re-initialize the logical table to standard
distribution if the number of RX rings changes during ring reservation.

v4: Use bnxt_get_rxfh_indir_size() to get the RSS table size.

v2: Use ALIGN() to roundup the RSS table size.
