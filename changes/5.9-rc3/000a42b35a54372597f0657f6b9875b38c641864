powerpc/book3s64/keys/kuap: Reset AMR/IAMR values on kexec

As we kexec across kernels that use AMR/IAMR for different purposes
we need to ensure that new kernels get kexec'd with a reset value
of AMR/IAMR. For ex: the new kernel can use key 0 for kernel mapping and the old
AMR value prevents access to key 0.

This patch also removes reset if IAMR and AMOR in kexec_sequence. Reset of AMOR
is not needed and the IAMR reset is partial (it doesn't do the reset
on secondary cpus) and is redundant with this patch.
