block: use bd_prepare_to_claim directly in the loop driver

The arcane magic in bd_start_claiming is only needed to be able to claim
a block_device that hasn't been fully set up.  Switch the loop driver
that claims from the ioctl path with a fully set up struct block_device
to just use the much simpler bd_prepare_to_claim directly.
