block: defer flush request no matter whether we have elevator

Commit 7520872c0cf4 ("block: don't defer flushes on blk-mq + scheduling")
tried to fix deadlock for cycled wait between flush requests and data
request into flush_data_in_flight. The former holded all driver tags
and wait for data request completion, but the latter can not complete
for waiting free driver tags.

After commit 923218f6166a ("blk-mq: don't allocate driver tag upfront
for flush rq"), flush requests will not get driver tag before queuing
into flush queue.

* With elevator, flush request just get sched_tags before inserting
  flush queue. It will not get driver tag until issue them to driver.
  data request on list fq->flush_data_in_flight will complete in
  the end.

* Without elevator, each flush request will get a driver tag when
  allocate request. Then data request on fq->flush_data_in_flight
  don't worry about lacking driver tag.

In both of these cases, cycled wait cannot be true. So we may allow
to defer flush request.
