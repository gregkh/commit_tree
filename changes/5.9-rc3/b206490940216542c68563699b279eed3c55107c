net/mlx5: DR, Change push vlan action sequence

The DR TX state machine supports the following order:
modify header, push vlan and encapsulation.
Instead fs_dr would pass:
push vlan, modify header and encapsulation.

The above caused the rule creation to fail on invalid action
sequence provided error.
