torture: Dump ftrace at shutdown only if requested

If there is a large number of torture tests running concurrently,
all of which are dumping large ftrace buffers at shutdown time, the
resulting dumping can take a very long time, particularly on systems
with rotating-rust storage.  This commit therefore adds a default-off
torture.ftrace_dump_at_shutdown module parameter that enables
shutdown-time ftrace-buffer dumping.
