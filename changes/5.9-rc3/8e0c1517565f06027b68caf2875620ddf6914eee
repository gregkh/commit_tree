bpf, selftests: Add tests for sock_ops load with r9, r8.r7 registers

Loads in sock_ops case when using high registers requires extra logic to
ensure the correct temporary value is used. We need to ensure the temp
register does not use either the src_reg or dst_reg. Lets add an asm
test to force the logic is triggered.

The xlated code is here,

  30: (7b) *(u64 *)(r9 +32) = r7
  31: (61) r7 = *(u32 *)(r9 +28)
  32: (15) if r7 == 0x0 goto pc+2
  33: (79) r7 = *(u64 *)(r9 +0)
  34: (63) *(u32 *)(r7 +916) = r8
  35: (79) r7 = *(u64 *)(r9 +32)

Notice r9 and r8 are not used for temp registers and r7 is chosen.
