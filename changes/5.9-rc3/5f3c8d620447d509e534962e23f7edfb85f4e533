rcu/tree: Maintain separate array for vmalloc ptrs

To do so, we use an array of kvfree_rcu_bulk_data structures.
It consists of two elements:
 - index number 0 corresponds to slab pointers.
 - index number 1 corresponds to vmalloc pointers.

Keeping vmalloc pointers separated from slab pointers makes
it possible to invoke the right freeing API for the right
kind of pointer.

It also prepares us for future headless support for vmalloc
and SLAB objects. Such objects cannot be queued on a linked
list and are instead directly into an array.
