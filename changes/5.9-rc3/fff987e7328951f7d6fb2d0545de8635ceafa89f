ARM: dts: rockchip: rename label and nodename pinctrl subnodes that end with gpio

A test with the command below gives for example this error:

arch/arm/boot/dts/rk3288-tinker.dt.yaml: tsadc: otp-gpio:
{'phandle': [[54]], 'rockchip,pins': [[0, 10, 0, 118]]}
is not of type 'array'

'gpio' is a sort of reserved nodename and should not be used
for pinctrl in combination with 'rockchip,pins', so change
nodes that end with 'gpio' to end with 'pin' or 'pins'.

make ARCH=arm dtbs_check
DT_SCHEMA_FILES=~/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/
dtschema/schemas/gpio/gpio.yaml
