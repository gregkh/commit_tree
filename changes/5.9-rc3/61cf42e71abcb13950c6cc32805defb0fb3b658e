ice: move auto FEC checks into ice_cfg_phy_fec()

The call to ice_cfg_phy_fec() requires the caller to perform certain
actions before calling it. Instead of imposing these preconditions move
the operations into the function and perform them ourselves.

Also, fix some style issues in nearby touched code.
