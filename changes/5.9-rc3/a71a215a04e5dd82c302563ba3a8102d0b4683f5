drm/vgem: remove _unlocked suffix in drm_gem_object_put_unlocked

Spelling out _unlocked for each and every driver is a annoying.
Especially if we consider how many drivers, do not know (or need to)
about the horror stories involving struct_mutex.

Just drop the suffix. It makes the API cleaner.

Done via the following script:

__from=drm_gem_object_put_unlocked
__to=drm_gem_object_put
for __file in $(git grep --name-only $__from); do
  sed -i  "s/$__from/$__to/g" $__file;
done
