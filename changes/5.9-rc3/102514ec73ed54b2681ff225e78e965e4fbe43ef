dma-buf: minor doc touch-ups

Just some tiny edits:
- fix link to struct dma_fence
- give slightly more meaningful title - the polling here is about
  implicit fences, explicit fences (in sync_file or drm_syncobj) also
  have their own polling

v2: I misplaced the .rst include change corresponding to this patch.
