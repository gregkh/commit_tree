ASoC: intel/skl/hda - fix probe regression on systems without i915

Starting in commit cbc7a6b5a87a ("ASoC: soc-card: add
snd_soc_card_add_dai_link()"), error value from ASoc add_dai_link() is
no longer ignored.

The generic HDA machine driver relied on the old semantics to disable
i915 HDMI/DP audio codec at runtime. If no display codec was present,
add_dai_link() returned an error, but this was ignored and rest of the
card was successfully probed.

Fix the problem by changing the machine driver add_dai_link() to not
return an error in this case.
