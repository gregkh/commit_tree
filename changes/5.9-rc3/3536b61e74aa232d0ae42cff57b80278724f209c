xfs: unwind log item error flagging

When an buffer IO error occurs, we want to mark all
the log items attached to the buffer as failed. Open code
the error handling loop so that we can modify the flagging for the
different types of objects directly and independently of each other.

This also allows us to remove the ->iop_error method from the log
item operations.
