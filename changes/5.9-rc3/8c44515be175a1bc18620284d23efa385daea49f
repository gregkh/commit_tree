drm/amd/display: clip plane rects in DM before passing into DC

[Why]
DC global validation can fail when userspace requests to draw large
plane without performing the clipping themselves.

This is observed in the IGT kms_plane panning tests for 4K displays
where they draw an 8K plane without any clipping while expecting only
the top 4K to be drawn.

[How]
DRM already has helpers to take care of the clipping necessary and to
mark whether a plane is visible or not, so make use of these helpers
in DM before passing the plane to DC.
