bpf: Switch btf_parse_vmlinux to btf_find_by_name_kind

btf_parse_vmlinux() implements manual search for struct bpf_ctx_convert
since at the time of implementing btf_find_by_name_kind() was not
available.

Later btf_find_by_name_kind() was introduced in 27ae7997a661 ("bpf:
Introduce BPF_PROG_TYPE_STRUCT_OPS"). It provides similar search
functionality and can be leveraged in btf_parse_vmlinux(). Do it.
