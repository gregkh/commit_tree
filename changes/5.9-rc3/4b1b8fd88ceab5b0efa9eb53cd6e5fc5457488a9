arm64: dts: mt8183-evb: Fix unit name warnings

Remove the unit address from the DT nodes that doesn't have a reg
property. This fixes the following unit name warnings:

    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): /soc/pinctrl@10005000/mmc0@0: node has a unit name, but no reg or ranges property
    Warning (unit_address_vs_reg): /soc/pinctrl@10005000/mmc1@0: node has a unit name, but no reg or ranges property
