mm: memcontrol: restore proper dirty throttling when memory.high changes

Commit 8c8c383c04f6 ("mm: memcontrol: try harder to set a new
memory.high") inadvertently removed a callback to recalculate the
writeback cache size in light of a newly configured memory.high limit.

Without letting the writeback cache know about a potentially heavily
reduced limit, it may permit too many dirty pages, which can cause
unnecessary reclaim latencies or even avoidable OOM situations.

This was spotted while reading the code, it hasn't knowingly caused any
problems in practice so far.
