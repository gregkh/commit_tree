exec: Implement kernel_execve

To allow the kernel not to play games with set_fs to call exec
implement kernel_execve.  The function kernel_execve takes pointers
into kernel memory and copies the values pointed to onto the new
userspace stack.

The calls with arguments from kernel space of do_execve are replaced
with calls to kernel_execve.

The calls do_execve and do_execveat are made static as there are now
no callers outside of exec.

The comments that mention do_execve are updated to refer to
kernel_execve or execve depending on the circumstances.  In addition
to correcting the comments, this makes it easy to grep for do_execve
and verify it is not used.
