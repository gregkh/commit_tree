ext4: don't BUG on inconsistent journal feature

A customer has reported a BUG_ON in ext4_clear_journal_err() hitting
during an LTP testing. Either this has been caused by a test setup
issue where the filesystem was being overwritten while LTP was mounting
it or the journal replay has overwritten the superblock with invalid
data. In either case it is preferable we don't take the machine down
with a BUG_ON. So handle the situation of unexpectedly missing
has_journal feature more gracefully. We issue warning and fail the mount
in the cases where the race window is narrow and the failed check is
most likely a programming error. In cases where fs corruption is more
likely, we do full ext4_error() handling before failing mount / remount.
