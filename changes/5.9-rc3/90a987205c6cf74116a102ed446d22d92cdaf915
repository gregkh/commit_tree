drm/i915/gt: Only swap to a random sibling once upon creation

The danger in switching at random upon intel_context_pin is that the
context may still actually be inflight, as it will not be scheduled out
until a context switch after it is complete -- that may be a long time
after we do a final intel_context_unpin.
