firmware: smccc: Add ARCH_SOC_ID support

SMCCC v1.2 adds a new optional function SMCCC_ARCH_SOC_ID to obtain a
SiP defined SoC identification value. Add support for the same.

Also using the SoC bus infrastructure, let us expose the platform
specific SoC atrributes under sysfs.

There are various ways in which it can be represented in shortened form
for efficiency and ease of parsing for userspace. The chosen form is
described in the ABI document.
