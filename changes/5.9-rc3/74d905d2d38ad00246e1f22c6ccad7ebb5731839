Input: atmel_mxt_ts - only read messages in mxt_acquire_irq() when necessary

The workaround of reading all messages until an invalid is received is a
way of forcing the CHG line high, which means that when using
edge-triggered interrupts the interrupt can be acquired.

With level-triggered interrupts the workaround is unnecessary.

Also, most recent maXTouch chips have a feature called RETRIGEN which, when
enabled, reasserts the interrupt line every cycle if there are messages
waiting. This also makes the workaround unnecessary.

Note: the RETRIGEN feature is only in some firmware versions/chips, it's
not valid simply to enable the bit.
