selftest: Add tests for XDP programs in CPUMAP entries

Similar to what have been done for DEVMAP, introduce tests to verify
ability to add a XDP program to an entry in a CPUMAP.
Verify CPUMAP programs can not be attached to devices as a normal
XDP program, and only programs with BPF_XDP_CPUMAP attach type can
be loaded in a CPUMAP.
