btrfs: tracepoints: convert flush states to using EM macros

Only 6 out of all flush states were being printed correctly since
only they were exported via the TRACE_DEFINE_ENUM macro. This patch
converts all flush states to use the newly introduced EM macro so that
they can all be printed correctly.
