asm-generic/io.h: Fix sparse warnings on big-endian architectures

On big-endian architectures like OpenRISC, sparse outputs below warnings on
asm-generic/io.h.  This is due to io statements like:

  __raw_writel(cpu_to_le32(value), PCI_IOBASE + addr);

The __raw_writel() function expects native endianness, however
cpu_to_le32() returns __le32.  On little-endian machines these match up
and there is no issue.  However, on big-endian we get warnings, for IO
that is defined as little-endian the mismatch is expected.

The fix I propose is to __force to native endian.
