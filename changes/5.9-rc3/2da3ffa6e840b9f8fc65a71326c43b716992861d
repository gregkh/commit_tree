arm64: kvm: Remove kern_hyp_va from get_vcpu_ptr

get_vcpu_ptr is an assembly accessor for the percpu value
kvm_host_data->host_ctxt.__hyp_running_vcpu. kern_hyp_va only applies to
nVHE however __hyp_running_vcpu is always assigned a pointer that has
already had kern_hyp_va applied in __kvm_vcpu_run_nvhe.

kern_hyp_va is currently idempotent as it just masks and inserts the
tag, but this could change in future and the second application is
unnecessary.
