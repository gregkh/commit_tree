gpio: crystalcove: Free IRQ on error path

It appears that all, but request_irq(), calls in the driver are device managed.
In unlikely case of devm_gpiochip_add_data() failure the IRQ left requested.
Free IRQ on error path by switching to devm_request_threaded_irq() API.

Byproduct of this change is a drop of ->remove() callback completely.
