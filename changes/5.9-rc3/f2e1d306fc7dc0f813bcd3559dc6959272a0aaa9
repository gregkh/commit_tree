misc: pti: Repair kerneldoc formatting issues

W=1 kernel builds report a lack of descriptions for various
function arguments.  In reality they are documented, but the
formatting was not as expected '@.*:'.  Instead, '-'s were
used as separators.

This change fixes the following warnings:

 drivers/misc/pti.c:748: warning: Function parameter or member 'port' not described in 'pti_port_activate'
 drivers/misc/pti.c:748: warning: Function parameter or member 'tty' not described in 'pti_port_activate'
 drivers/misc/pti.c:765: warning: Function parameter or member 'port' not described in 'pti_port_shutdown'
 drivers/misc/pti.c:793: warning: Function parameter or member 'pdev' not described in 'pti_pci_probe'
 drivers/misc/pti.c:793: warning: Function parameter or member 'ent' not described in 'pti_pci_probe'
