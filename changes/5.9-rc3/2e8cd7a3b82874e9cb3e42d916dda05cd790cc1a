kvm: x86: limit the maximum number of vPMU fixed counters to 3

Some new Intel platforms (such as TGL) already have the
fourth fixed counter TOPDOWN.SLOTS, but it has not been
fully enabled on KVM and the host.

Therefore, we limit edx.split.num_counters_fixed to 3,
so that it does not break the kvm-unit-tests PMU test
case and bad-handled userspace.
