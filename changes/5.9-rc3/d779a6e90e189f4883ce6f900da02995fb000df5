scsi: ufs: Add quirk to fix abnormal ocs fatal error

Some controller like Exynos determines if FATAL ERROR (0x7) in OCS field in
UTRD occurs for values other than GOOD (0x0) in STATUS field in response
upiu as well as errors that a host controller can't cover.  This patch is
to prevent from reporting command results in those cases.
