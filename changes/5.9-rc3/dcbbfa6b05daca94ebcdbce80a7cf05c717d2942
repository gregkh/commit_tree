powerpc/powernv/idle: Rename pnv_first_spr_loss_level variable

Replace the variable name from using "pnv_first_spr_loss_level" to
"deep_spr_loss_state".

pnv_first_spr_loss_level is supposed to be the earliest state that
has OPAL_PM_LOSE_FULL_CONTEXT set, in other places the kernel uses the
"deep" states as terminology. Hence renaming the variable to be coherent
to its semantics.
