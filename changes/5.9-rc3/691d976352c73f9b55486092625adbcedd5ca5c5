fanotify: report parent fid + child fid

Add support for FAN_REPORT_FID | FAN_REPORT_DIR_FID.
Internally, it is implemented as a private case of reporting both
parent and child fids and name, the parent and child fids are recorded
in a variable length fanotify_name_event, but there is no name.

It should be noted that directory modification events are recorded
in fixed size fanotify_fid_event when not reporting name, just like
with group flags FAN_REPORT_FID.
