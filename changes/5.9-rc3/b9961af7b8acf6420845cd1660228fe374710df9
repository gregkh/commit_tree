net/mlx5e: Remove redundant RQ state query

When received a CQE error, the driver inspect the syndrome given by the
firmware. RQ recovery is initiated only as a result of a fatal syndrome;
syndrome which set the RQ into an error state. Hence no need to query
the RQ state at the beginning of the recovery process. Add additional
debug prints before recovering.
