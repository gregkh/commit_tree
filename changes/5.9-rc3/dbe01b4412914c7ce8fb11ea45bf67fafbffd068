Revert "clk: bcm2835: remove pllb"

This reverts commit 2256d89333bd17b8b56b42734a7e1046d52f7fc3. Since we
will be expanding the firmware clock driver, we'll need to remove the
quirks to deal with the PLLB. However, we still want to expose the clock
tree properly, so having that clock in the MMIO driver will allow that.
