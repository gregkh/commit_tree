ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw: add support for systems without i915 audio

Extend the generic SOF Soundwire machine driver to support systems where
iDisp HDMI/DP audio codec is disabled for some reason (i915 driver
disabled, HDMI/DP implemented with a discrete GPU, etc). Switch codecs
to SoC dummy in the affected DAI links. This allows to reuse existing
topologies for this case.
