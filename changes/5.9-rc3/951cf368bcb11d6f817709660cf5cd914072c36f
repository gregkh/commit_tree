bpf: net: Use precomputed btf_id for bpf iterators

One additional field btf_id is added to struct
bpf_ctx_arg_aux to store the precomputed btf_ids.
The btf_id is computed at build time with
BTF_ID_LIST or BTF_ID_LIST_GLOBAL macro definitions.
All existing bpf iterators are changed to used
pre-compute btf_ids.
