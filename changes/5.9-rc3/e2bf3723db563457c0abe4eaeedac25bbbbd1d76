drm/amd/powerplay: Fix hardmins not being sent to SMU for RV

[Why]
DC uses these to raise the voltage as needed for higher dispclk/dppclk
and to ensure that we have enough bandwidth to drive the displays.

There's a bug preventing these from actuially sending messages since
it's checking the actual clock (which is 0) instead of the incoming
clock (which shouldn't be 0) when deciding to send the hardmin.

[How]
Check the clocks != 0 instead of the actual clocks.
