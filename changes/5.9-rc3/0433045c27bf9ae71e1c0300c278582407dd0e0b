selftests: forwarding: forwarding.config.sample: Add port with no cable connected

Add NETIF_NO_CABLE port to tests topology.

The port can also be declared as an environment variable and tests can be
run like that:
NETIF_NO_CABLE=eth9 ./test.sh eth{1..8}

The NETIF_NO_CABLE port will be used by ethtool_extended_state test.
