bpf: revert "test_bpf: Flag tests that cannot be jited on s390"

This reverts commit 3203c9010060 ("test_bpf: flag tests that cannot
be jited on s390").

The s390 bpf JIT previously had a restriction on the maximum program
size, which required some tests in test_bpf to be flagged as expected
failures. The program size limitation has been removed, and the tests
now pass, so these tests should no longer be flagged.
