drm/vkms: change the max cursor width/height

This change expands the coverage for the IGT kms_cursor_crc test, where
the size varies between 64 and 512 for a square cursor. With this, in
addition to the cursor 64x64, this patch enables the test of cursors with
sizes: 128x128, 256x256, and 512x512.
