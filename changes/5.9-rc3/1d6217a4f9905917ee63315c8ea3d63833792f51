fscrypt: rename FS_KEY_DERIVATION_NONCE_SIZE

The name "FS_KEY_DERIVATION_NONCE_SIZE" is a bit outdated since due to
the addition of FSCRYPT_POLICY_FLAG_DIRECT_KEY, the file nonce may now
be used as a tweak instead of for key derivation.  Also, we're now
prefixing the fscrypt constants with "FSCRYPT_" instead of "FS_".

Therefore, rename this constant to FSCRYPT_FILE_NONCE_SIZE.
