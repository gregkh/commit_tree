tty: keyboard, do not speculate on func_table index

It is very unlikely for processor to speculate on the func_table index.
The index is uchar and func_table is of size 256. So the compiler would
need to screw up and generate a really bad code.

But to stay on the safe side, forbid speculation on this user passed
index.
