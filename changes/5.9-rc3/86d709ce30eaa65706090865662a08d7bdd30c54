x86/acrn: Allow ACRN guest to use X2APIC mode

The ACRN Hypervisor did not support x2APIC and thus x2APIC support was
disabled by always returning false when VM checked for x2APIC support.

ACRN received full support of x2APIC and exports the capability through
CPUID feature bits.

Let VM decide if it needs to switch to x2APIC mode according to CPUID
features.
