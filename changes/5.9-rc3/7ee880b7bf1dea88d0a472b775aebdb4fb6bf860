rcu: Initialize and destroy rcu_synchronize only when necessary

The __wait_rcu_gp() function unconditionally initializes and cleans up
each element of rs_array[], whether used or not.  This is slightly
wasteful and rather confusing, so this commit skips both initialization
and cleanup for duplicate callback functions.
