hwmon: add Corsair Commander Pro driver

This is v7 of a driver for the Corsair Commander Pro.
It provides sysfs attributes for:
- Reading fan speed
- Reading temp sensors
- Reading voltage values
- Writing pwm and reading last written pwm
- Reading fan and temp connection status

It is an usb driver, so it needs to be ignored by usbhid.
The Corsair Commander Pro is a fan controller and provides
no means for user interaction.
The two device numbers are there, because there is a slightly
different version of the same device. (Only difference
seem to be in some presets.)

Squashed:
 hwmon: (corsair-cpro) add fan_target

 This adds fan_target entries to the corsair-cpro driver.
 Reading the attribute from the device does not seem possible, so
 it returns the last set value (same as pwm).

 send_usb_cmd now has one more argument, which is needed for the
 fan_target command.

 hwmon: corsair-cpro: Change to HID driver

 This changes corsair-cpro to a hid driver using hid reports.
