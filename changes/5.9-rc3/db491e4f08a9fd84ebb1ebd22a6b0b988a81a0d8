habanalabs: Add dropped cs statistics info struct

Add command submission statistics structure which can be obtained
through the info ioctl. Each drop counter describes the reason for
which the command submission was dropped.
This information is needed for the user to be aware of the specific
reason for which the submitted work was dropped. The user can then
utilize the driver more efficiently.
