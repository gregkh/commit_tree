usb: typec: ucsi: Hold con->lock for the entire duration of ucsi_register_port()

Commit 081da1325d35 ("usb: typec: ucsi: displayport: Fix a potential race
during registration") made the ucsi code hold con->lock in
ucsi_register_displayport(). But we really don't want any interactions
with the connector to run before the port-registration process is fully
complete.

This commit moves the taking of con->lock from ucsi_register_displayport()
into ucsi_register_port() to achieve this.
