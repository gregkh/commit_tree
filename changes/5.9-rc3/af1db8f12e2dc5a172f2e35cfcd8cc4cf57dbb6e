xfs: remove unnecessary quota type masking

When XFS' quota functions take a parameter for the quota type, they only
care about the three quota record types (user, group, project).
Internal state flags and whatnot should never be passed by callers and
are an error.  Now that we've moved responsibility for filtering out
internal state to the callers, we can drop the masking everywhere else.

In other words, if you call a quota function, you must only pass in
one of XFS_DQTYPE_{USER,GROUP,PROJ}.
