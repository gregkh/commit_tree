dt-bindings: dma: dw: Convert DW DMAC to DT binding

Modern device tree bindings are supposed to be created as YAML-files
in accordance with dt-schema. This commit replaces the Synopsis
Designware DMA controller legacy bare text bindings with YAML file.
The only required prorties are "compatible", "reg", "#dma-cells" and
"interrupts", which will be used by the driver to correctly find the
controller memory region and handle its events. The rest of the properties
are optional, since in case if either "dma-channels" or "dma-masters" isn't
specified, the driver will attempt to auto-detect the IP core
configuration.
