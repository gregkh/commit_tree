staging: wfx: Use flex_array_size() helper in memcpy()

Make use of the flex_array_size() helper to calculate the size of a
flexible array member within an enclosing structure.

This helper offers defense-in-depth against potential integer
overflows, while at the same time makes it explicitly clear that
we are dealing with a flexible array member.
