mm, dump_page: do not crash with bad compound_mapcount()

If a compound page is being split while dump_page() is being run on that
page, we can end up calling compound_mapcount() on a page that is no
longer compound.  This leads to a crash (already seen at least once in the
field), due to the VM_BUG_ON_PAGE() assertion inside compound_mapcount().

(The above is from Matthew Wilcox's analysis of Qian Cai's bug report.)

A similar problem is possible, via compound_pincount() instead of
compound_mapcount().

In order to avoid this kind of crash, make dump_page() slightly more
robust, by providing a pair of simpler routines that don't contain
assertions: head_mapcount() and head_pincount().

For debug tools, we don't want to go *too* far in this direction, but this
is a simple small fix, and the crash has already been seen, so it's a good
trade-off.
