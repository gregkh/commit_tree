vdpa/mlx5: Add shared memory registration code

Add code to support registering address space region for the device. The
virtio driver can run as either:
1. Guest virtio driver
2. Userspace virtio driver on the host
3. Kernel virtio driver on the host

In any case a memory key object is required to provide access to memory
for the device.

This code will be shared by network or block driver implementations.
