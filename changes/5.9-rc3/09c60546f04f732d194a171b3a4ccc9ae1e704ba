./Makefile: add debug option to enable function aligned on 32 bytes

Recently 0day reported many strange performance changes (regression or
improvement), in which there was no obvious relation between the culprit
commit and the benchmark at the first look, and it causes people to doubt
the test itself is wrong.

Upon further check, many of these cases are caused by the change to the
alignment of kernel text or data, as whole text/data of kernel are linked
together, change in one domain may affect alignments of other domains.

gcc has an option '-falign-functions=n' to force text aligned, and with
that option enabled, some of those performance changes will be gone, like
[1][2][3].

Add this option so that developers and 0day can easily find performance
bump caused by text alignment change, as tracking these strange bump is
quite time consuming.  Though it can't help in other cases like data
alignment changes like [4].

Following is some size data for v5.7 kernel built with a RHEL config used
in 0day:

    text      data      bss	 dec	   filename
  19738771  13292906  5554236  38585913	 vmlinux.noalign
  19758591  13297002  5529660  38585253	 vmlinux.align32

Raw vmlinux size in bytes:

	v5.7		v5.7+align32
	253950832	254018000	+0.02%

Some benchmark data, most of them have no big change:

  * hackbench:		[ -1.8%,  +0.5%]

  * fsmark:		[ -3.2%,  +3.4%]  # ext4/xfs/btrfs

  * kbuild:		[ -2.0%,  +0.9%]

  * will-it-scale:	[ -0.5%,  +1.8%]  # mmap1/pagefault3

  * netperf:
    - TCP_CRR		[+16.6%, +97.4%]
    - TCP_RR		[-18.5%,  -1.8%]
    - TCP_STREAM	[ -1.1%,  +1.9%]
