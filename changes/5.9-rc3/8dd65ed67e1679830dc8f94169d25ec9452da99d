media: cec: remove unused waitq and phys_addrs fields

The cec_adapter struct contained a waitq field that isn't used
anywhere, so drop this.

It also contained a phys_addrs array to store any reported physical
addresses. However, this was never actually used, so this field is
removed as well. The original idea was to let the core keep track of
this information, but nothing was ever done with this. Should this
be needed in the future then it is easy enough to resurrect this.
