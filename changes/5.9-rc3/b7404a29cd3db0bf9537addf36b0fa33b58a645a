usb: typec: intel_pmc_mux: Definitions for response status bits

Adding definitions for the two status bits that we have in
the command response data structure.

Also, from now on only considering the second status bit,
which tells was the failure fatal or not, if the first bit
is set. If the first bit is not set, then the command was
successful, and we need to ignore the second bit.
