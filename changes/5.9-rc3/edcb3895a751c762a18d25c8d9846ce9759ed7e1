video: fbdev: neofb: fix memory leak in neo_scan_monitor()

neofb_probe() calls neo_scan_monitor() that can successfully allocate a
memory for info->monspecs.modedb and proceed to case 0x03. There it does
not free the memory and returns -1. neofb_probe() goes to label
err_scan_monitor, thus, it does not free this memory through calling
fb_destroy_modedb() as well. We can not go to label err_init_hw since
neo_scan_monitor() can fail during memory allocation. So, the patch frees
the memory directly for case 0x03.
