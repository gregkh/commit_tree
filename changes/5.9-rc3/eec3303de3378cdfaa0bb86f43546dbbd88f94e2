drm/amd/display: Improve DisplayPort monitor interop

[Why]
DC is very fast at link training and stream enablement
which causes issues such as blackscreens for non-compliant
monitors.

[How]
After debugging with scaler vendors we implement the
minimum delays at the necessary locations to ensure
the monitor does not hang.  Delays are generic due to
lack of IEEE OUI information on the failing displays.
