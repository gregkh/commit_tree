arm64: dts: msm8916-samsung/longcheer: Move pinctrl/regulators to end of file

It is helpful to be able to see all hardware components in one part
of the device tree, without having to scroll over the large amount
of regulator/pinctrl nodes. Keep those separated at the end of the file
to make navigation a bit easier.

This also makes it consistent with the order used in apq8016-sbc.dtsi.
