drm/i915: Release shortlived maps of longlived objects

Some objects we map once during their construction, and then never
access their mappings again, even if they are kept around for the
duration of the driver. Keeping those pages mapped, often vmapped, is
therefore wasteful and we should release the maps as soon as we no
longer need them.
