powerpc/kexec_file: Setup backup region for kdump kernel

Though kdump kernel boots from loaded address, the first 64KB of it is
copied down to real 0. So, setup a backup region and let purgatory
copy the first 64KB of crashed kernel into this backup region before
booting into kdump kernel. Update reserve map with backup region and
crashed kernel's memory to avoid kdump kernel from accidentially using
that memory.
