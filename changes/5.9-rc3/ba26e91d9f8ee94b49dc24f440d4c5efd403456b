dt-bindings: mmc: Add full-pwr-cycle-in-suspend property

The commit 5a36d6bcdf23 ("mmc: core: Add DT-bindings for
MMC_CAP2_FULL_PWR_CYCLE") added the "full-pwr-cycle" property which
is possible to perform a full power cycle of the card at any time.

However, some environment (like r8a77951-salvator-xs) is possible
to perform a full power cycle of the card in suspend via firmware
(PSCI on arm-trusted-firmware). So, add a new property for such
environment.
