backlight: backlight: Add backlight_is_blank()

The backlight support has three properties that express the state:
 - power
 - state
 - fb_blank

It is un-documented and easy to get wrong.
Add backlight_is_blank() helper to make it simpler
for drivers to get the check of the state correct.

A lot of drivers also includes checks for fb_blank.
This check is redundant when the state is checked
and thus not needed in this helper function.
But added anyway to avoid introducing subtle bugs
due to the creative use of fb_blank in some drivers.
Introducing this helper will for some drivers results in
added support for fb_blank. This will be a change in
functionality, which will improve the backlight driver.

Rolling out this helper to all relevant backlight drivers
will eliminate almost all accesses to fb_blank.
