iio: gyro: fxas21002c: Move 'fxas21002c_reg_fields' to the only file its used

'fxas21002c_reg_fields' is only used in '*core*', meaning that '*i2c*'
and '*spi*' complain of a defined but not used const variable.  Let's
move it into the source file.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 In file included from drivers/iio/gyro/fxas21002c_i2c.c:14:
