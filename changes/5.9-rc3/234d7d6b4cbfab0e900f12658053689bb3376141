arm64: dts: qcom: Add support for Sony Xperia 10/10 Plus (Ganges platform)

Add device tree support for the Sony Xperia 10 and 10
Plus smartphones. They are all based on the Sony Ganges
platform (sdm630/636) and share a lot of common code.
The differences are really minor, so a Ganges-common DTSI
has been created to reduce clutter.

10 - Kirin
10 Plus - Mermaid

This platform is based on SoMC Nile, but there are some
major differences when it comes to pin configuration and
panel setup (among others).

The boards currently support:
* Screen console
* SDHCI
* I2C
* pstore log dump
* GPIO keys
* PSCI idle states
