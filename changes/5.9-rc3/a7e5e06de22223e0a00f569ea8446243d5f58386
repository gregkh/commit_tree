drm/vblank: Register drmm cleanup action once per drm_vblank_crtc

Since we'll be allocating resources for kthread_create_worker() in the
next commit (which could fail and require us to clean up the mess),
let's simplify the cleanup process a bit by registering a
drm_vblank_init_release() action for each drm_vblank_crtc so they're
still cleaned up if we fail to initialize one of them.

Changes since v3:
* Use drmm_add_action_or_reset() - Daniel Vetter
