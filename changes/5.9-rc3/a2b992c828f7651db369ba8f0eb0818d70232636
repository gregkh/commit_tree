debugfs: make sure we can remove u32_array files cleanly

debugfs_create_u32_array() allocates a small structure to wrap
the data and size information about the array. If users ever
try to remove the file this leads to a leak since nothing ever
frees this wrapper.

That said there are no upstream users of debugfs_create_u32_array()
that'd remove a u32 array file (we only have one u32 array user in
CMA), so there is no real bug here.

Make callers pass a wrapper they allocated. This way the lifetime
management of the wrapper is on the caller, and we can avoid the
potential leak in debugfs.
