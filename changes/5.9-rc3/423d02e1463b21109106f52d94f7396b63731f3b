sched/fair: Optimize dequeue_task_fair()

While looking at enqueue_task_fair and dequeue_task_fair, it occurred
to me that dequeue_task_fair can also be optimized as Vincent described
in commit 7d148be69e3a ("sched/fair: Optimize enqueue_task_fair()").

When encountering throttled cfs_rq, dequeue_throttle label can ensure
se not to be NULL, and rq->nr_running remains unchanged, so we can also
skip the early balance check.
