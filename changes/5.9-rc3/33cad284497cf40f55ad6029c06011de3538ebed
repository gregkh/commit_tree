perf/x86/intel/lbr: Create kmem_cache for the LBR context data

A new kmem_cache method is introduced to allocate the PMU specific data
task_ctx_data, which requires the PMU specific code to create a
kmem_cache.

Currently, the task_ctx_data is only used by the Intel LBR call stack
feature, which is introduced since Haswell. The kmem_cache should be
only created for Haswell and later platforms. There is no alignment
requirement for the existing platforms.
