powerpc/64s: restore_math remove TM test

The TM test in restore_math added by commit dc16b553c949e ("powerpc:
Always restore FPU/VEC/VSX if hardware transactional memory in use") is
no longer necessary after commit a8318c13e79ba ("powerpc/tm: Fix
restoring FP/VMX facility incorrectly on interrupts"), which removed
the cases where restore_math has to restore if TM is active.
