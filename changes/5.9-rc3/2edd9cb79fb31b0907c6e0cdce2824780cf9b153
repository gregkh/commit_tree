kvm: detect assigned device via irqbypass manager

vDPA devices has dedicated backed hardware like
passthrough-ed devices. Then it is possible to setup irq
offloading to vCPU for vDPA devices. Thus this patch tries to
manipulated assigned device counters by
kvm_arch_start/end_assignment() in irqbypass manager, so that
assigned devices could be detected in update_pi_irte()

We will increase/decrease the assigned device counter in kvm/x86.
Both vDPA and VFIO would go through this code path.

Only X86 uses these counters and kvm_arch_start/end_assignment(),
so this code path only affect x86 for now.
