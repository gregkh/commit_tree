irqchip/brcmstb-l2: Set controller as wake-up source

Utilize the Broadcom interrupt controller standard property
"brcm,irq-can-wake" to flag whether this particular interrupt controller
instance is wake-up capable.

Since we do not know what type of parent interrupt controller we are
interfaced with, ensure that enable_irq_wake() is called early on.
