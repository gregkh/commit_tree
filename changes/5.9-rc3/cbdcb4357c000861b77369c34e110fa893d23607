io_uring: do grab_env() just before punting

Currently io_steal_work() is disabled, and every linked request should
go through task_work for initialisation. Do io_req_work_grab_env()
just before io-wq punting and for the whole link, so any request
reachable by io_steal_work() is prepared.

This is also interesting for another reason -- it localises
io_req_work_grab_env() into one place just before io-wq punting, helping
to to better manage req->work lifetime and add some neat
cleanup/optimisations later.
