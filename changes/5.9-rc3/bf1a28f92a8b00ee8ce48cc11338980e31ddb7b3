scsi: scsi_transport_srp: Sanitize scsi_target_block/unblock sequences

The SCSI midlayer does not allow state transitions from SDEV_BLOCK to
SDEV_BLOCK so calling scsi_target_block() from __rport_fast_io_fail() is
wrong as the port is already blocked.  Similarly, we don't need to call
scsi_target_unblock() afterwards as the function has already done this.
