gpio: max77620: Use irqchip template

This change addresses one of the GPIO-core TODOs for the MAX77620 driver
which requires modern drivers to use the irqchip template. Instead of
using the GPIO's irqchip-helpers for creating the IRQ domain, the
gpio_irq_chip structure is now filled by the driver itself and then
gpiochip_add_data() takes care of instantiating the IRQ domain for us.
