libbpf bpf_helpers: Use __builtin_offsetof for offsetof

The non-builtin route for offsetof has a dependency on size_t from
stdlib.h/stdint.h that is undeclared and may break targets.
The offsetof macro in bpf_helpers may disable the same macro in other
headers that have a #ifdef offsetof guard. Rather than add additional
dependencies improve the offsetof macro declared here to use the
builtin that is available since llvm 3.7 (the first with a BPF backend).
