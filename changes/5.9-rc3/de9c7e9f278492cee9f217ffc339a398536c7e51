USB: serial: cp210x: add support for TIOCGICOUNT

Enable TIOCGICOUNT to allow reading out the (unused) interrupt counters
and error statistics.

Note that modem-status events are currently left unimplemented as they
appear to be buffered on at least CP2102 and therefore cannot be used to
implement TIOCMIWAIT.
