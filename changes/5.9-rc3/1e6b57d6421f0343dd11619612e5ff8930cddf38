unexport linux/elfcore.h

It's unusable from userland - it uses elf_gregset_t, which is not
provided by exported headers.  glibc has it in sys/procfs.h, but
the same file defines struct elf_prstatus, so linux/elfcore.h can't
be included once sys/procfs.h has been pulled.  Same goes for uclibc
and dietlibc simply doesn't have elf_gregset_t defined anywhere.

IOW, no userland source is including that thing.
