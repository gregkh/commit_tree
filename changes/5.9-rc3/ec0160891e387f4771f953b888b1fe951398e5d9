irqdomain/treewide: Free firmware node after domain removal

Commit 711419e504eb ("irqdomain: Add the missing assignment of
domain->fwnode for named fwnode") unintentionally caused a dangling pointer
page fault issue on firmware nodes that were freed after IRQ domain
allocation. Commit e3beca48a45b fixed that dangling pointer issue by only
freeing the firmware node after an IRQ domain allocation failure. That fix
no longer frees the firmware node immediately, but leaves the firmware node
allocated after the domain is removed.

The firmware node must be kept around through irq_domain_remove, but should be
freed it afterwards.

Add the missing free operations after domain removal where where appropriate.
