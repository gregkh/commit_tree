scsi: target: Check enforce_pr_isids during registration

Move the check for enforce_pr_isids to the registration code where we can
fail at the time an initiator tries to register a path without an isid. In
its current place in __core_scsi3_locate_pr_reg, it is too late because it
can be registered and be reported in PR in commands and it is stuck in this
state because we cannot unregister it.
