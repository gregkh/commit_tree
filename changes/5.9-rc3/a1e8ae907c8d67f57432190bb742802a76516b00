net/devlink: Support setting hardware address of port function

PCI PF and VF devlink port can manage the function represented by a
devlink port.

Allow users to set port function's hardware address.

Example of a PCI VF port which supports a port function:
$ devlink port show pci/0000:06:00.0/2
pci/0000:06:00.0/2: type eth netdev enp6s0pf0vf1 flavour pcivf pfnum 0 vfnum 1
  function:
    hw_addr 00:00:00:00:00:00

$ devlink port function set pci/0000:06:00.0/2 hw_addr 00:11:22:33:44:55

$ devlink port show pci/0000:06:00.0/2
pci/0000:06:00.0/2: type eth netdev enp6s0pf0vf1 flavour pcivf pfnum 0 vfnum 1
  function:
    hw_addr 00:11:22:33:44:55
