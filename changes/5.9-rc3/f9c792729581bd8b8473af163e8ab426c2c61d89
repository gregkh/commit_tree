bpf: Refactor to provide aux info to bpf_iter_init_seq_priv_t

This patch refactored target bpf_iter_init_seq_priv_t callback
function to accept additional information. This will be needed
in later patches for map element targets since a particular
map should be passed to traverse elements for that particular
map. In the future, other information may be passed to target
as well, e.g., pid, cgroup id, etc. to customize the iterator.
