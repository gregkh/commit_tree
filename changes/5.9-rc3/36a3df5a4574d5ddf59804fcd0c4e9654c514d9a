blk-mq: put driver tag when this request is completed

It is natural to release driver tag when this request is completed by
LLD or device since its purpose is for LLD use.

One big benefit is that the released tag can be re-used quicker since
bio_endio() may take too long.

Meantime we don't need to release driver tag for flush request.
