drm/i915/psr: Program default IO buffer Wake and Fast Wake

The IO buffer Wake and Fast Wake bit size and value have been changed from
Gen12+. It programs the default value of IO buffer Wake and Fast Wake on
Gen12+. It adds definitions of IO buffer Wake and Fast Wake for pre Gen12
and Gen12+. And it aligns PSR2 definition macros.

v2: Fix macro definitions. (José)
v3: Addressed review comments from José
  - Add missing default values of IO_BUFFER_WAKE and FAST_WAKE for GEN9+
  - Change a style of macro naming in order to use lines as input.
  - Update Todo comments.
v4: Add parentheses to macros to avoid precedence issues.
