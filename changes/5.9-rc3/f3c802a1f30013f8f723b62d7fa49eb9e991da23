crypto: algif_aead - Only wake up when ctx->more is zero

AEAD does not support partial requests so we must not wake up
while ctx->more is set.  In order to distinguish between the
case of no data sent yet and a zero-length request, a new init
flag has been added to ctx.

SKCIPHER has also been modified to ensure that at least a block
of data is available if there is more data to come.
