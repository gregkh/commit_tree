spi: spi-geni-qcom: Don't keep a local state variable

The variable "cur_mcmd" kept track of our current state (idle, xfer,
cs, cancel).  We don't really need it, so get rid of it.  Instead:
* Use separate condition variables for "chip select done", "cancel
  done", and "abort done".  This is important so that if a "done"
  comes through (perhaps some previous interrupt finally came through)
  it can't confuse the cancel/abort function.
* Use the "done" interrupt only for when a chip select or transfer is
  done and we can tell the difference by looking at whether "cur_xfer"
  is NULL.

This is mostly a no-op change.  However, it is possible it could fix
an issue where a super delayed interrupt for a cancel command could
have confused our waiting for an abort command.
