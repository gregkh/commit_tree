inet: Remove an unnecessary argument of syn_ack_recalc().

Commit 0c3d79bce48034018e840468ac5a642894a521a3 ("tcp: reduce SYN-ACK
retrans for TCP_DEFER_ACCEPT") introduces syn_ack_recalc() which decides
if a minisock is held and a SYN+ACK is retransmitted or not.

If rskq_defer_accept is not zero in syn_ack_recalc(), max_retries always
has the same value because max_retries is overwritten by rskq_defer_accept
in reqsk_timer_handler().

This commit adds three changes:
- remove redundant non-zero check for rskq_defer_accept in
   reqsk_timer_handler().
- remove max_retries from the arguments of syn_ack_recalc() and use
   rskq_defer_accept instead.
- rename thresh to max_syn_ack_retries for readability.
