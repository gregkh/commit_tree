md/raid5-cache: clear MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING before flushing stripes

In recovery, if we process too much data, raid5-cache may set
MD_SB_CHANGE_PENDING, which causes spinning in handle_stripe().
Fix this issue by clearing the bit before flushing data only
stripes. This issue was initially discussed in [1].
