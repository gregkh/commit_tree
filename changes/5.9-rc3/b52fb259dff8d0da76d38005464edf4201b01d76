mmc: core: Always allow the card detect uevent to be consumed

The approach to allow userspace ~5s to consume the uevent, which is
triggered when a new card is inserted/initialized, currently requires the
mmc host to support system wakeup.

This is unnecessary limiting, especially for an mmc host that relies on a
GPIO IRQ for card detect. More precisely, the mmc host may not support
system wakeup for its corresponding struct device, while the GPIO IRQ still
could be configured as a wakeup IRQ via enable_irq_wake().

To support all various cases, let's simply drop the need for the wakeup
support. Instead let's always register a wakeup source and activate it for
all card detect IRQs by calling __pm_wakeup_event().
