docs: move remaining stuff under Documentation/*.txt to Documentation/staging

There are several files that I was unable to find a proper place
for them, and 3 ones that are still in plain old text format.

Let's place those stuff behind the carpet, as we'd like to keep the
root directory clean.

We can later discuss and move those into better places.
