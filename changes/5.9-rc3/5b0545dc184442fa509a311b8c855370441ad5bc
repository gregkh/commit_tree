Revert "HID: usbhid: do not sleep when opening device"

This reverts commit d3132792285859253c466354fd8d54d1fe0ba786.

This patch causes a regression with quite a few devices, as probing fails
because of the race where the first IRQ is dropped on the floor (after
hid_device_io_start() happens, but before the 50ms timeout passess), and
report descriptor never gets parsed and populated.

As this is just a boot time micro-optimization, let's revert the
patch for 5.9 now, and fix this properly eventually for next merge
window.
