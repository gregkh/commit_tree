powerpc/powernv/pci: Refactor pnv_ioda_alloc_pe()

Rework the PE allocation logic to allow allocating blocks of PEs rather
than individually. We'll use this to allocate contigious blocks of PEs for
the SR-IOVs.

This patch also adds code to pnv_ioda_alloc_pe() and pnv_ioda_reserve_pe() to
use the existing, but unused, phb->pe_alloc_mutex. Currently these functions
use atomic bit ops to release a currently allocated PE number. However,
the pnv_ioda_alloc_pe() wants to have exclusive access to the bit map while
scanning for hole large enough to accomodate the allocation size.
