ASoC: fsl-asoc-card: Add MQS support

The MQS codec isn't an i2c device, so use of_find_device_by_node
to get platform device pointer.

Because MQS only support playback, then add a new audio map.

And there maybe "model" property or no "audio-routing" property in
devicetree, so add some enhancement for these two property.
