dma-buf: Remove custom seqcount lockdep class key

Commit 3c3b177a9369 ("reservation: add support for read-only access
using rcu") introduced a sequence counter to manage updates to
reservations. Back then, the reservation object initializer
reservation_object_init() was always inlined.

Having the sequence counter initialization inlined meant that each of
the call sites would have a different lockdep class key, which would've
broken lockdep's deadlock detection. The aforementioned commit thus
introduced, and exported, a custom seqcount lockdep class key and name.

The commit 8735f16803f00 ("dma-buf: cleanup reservation_object_init...")
transformed the reservation object initializer to a normal non-inlined C
function. seqcount_init(), which automatically defines the seqcount
lockdep class key and must be called non-inlined, can now be safely used.

Remove the seqcount custom lockdep class key, name, and export. Use
seqcount_init() inside the dma reservation object initializer.
