usb: core: fix quirks_param_set() writing to a const pointer

The function quirks_param_set() takes as argument a const char* pointer
to the new value of the usbcore.quirks parameter. It then casts this
pointer to a non-const char* pointer and passes it to the strsep()
function, which overwrites the value.

Fix this by creating a copy of the value using kstrdup() and letting
that copy be written to by strsep().
