s390/ism: indicate correct error reason in ism_alloc_dmb()

When the ism driver allocates a new dmb in ism_alloc_dmb() it must
first check for and reserve a slot in the sba bitmap. When
find_next_zero_bit() finds no free slot then the return code is -ENOMEM.
This code conflicts with the error when the alloc() fails later in the
code. As a result of that the caller can not differentiate
between out-of-memory conditions and sba-bitmap-full conditions.
Fix that by using the return code -ENOSPC when the sba slot
reservation failed.
