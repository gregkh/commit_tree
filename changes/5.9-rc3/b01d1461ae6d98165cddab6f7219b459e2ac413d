xfs: call xfs_buf_iodone directly

All unmarked dirty buffers should be in the AIL and have log items
attached to them. Hence when they are written, we will run a
callback to remove the item from the AIL if appropriate. Now that
we've handled inode and dquot buffers, all remaining calls are to
xfs_buf_iodone() and so we can hard code this rather than use an
indirect call.
