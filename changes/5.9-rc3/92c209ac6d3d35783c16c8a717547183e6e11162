kcsan: Improve IRQ state trace reporting

To improve the general usefulness of the IRQ state trace events with
KCSAN enabled, save and restore the trace information when entering and
exiting the KCSAN runtime as well as when generating a KCSAN report.

Without this, reporting the IRQ trace events (whether via a KCSAN report
or outside of KCSAN via a lockdep report) is rather useless due to
continuously being touched by KCSAN. This is because if KCSAN is
enabled, every instrumented memory access causes changes to IRQ trace
events (either by KCSAN disabling/enabling interrupts or taking
report_lock when generating a report).

Before "lockdep: Prepare for NMI IRQ state tracking", KCSAN avoided
touching the IRQ trace events via raw_local_irq_save/restore() and
lockdep_off/on().
