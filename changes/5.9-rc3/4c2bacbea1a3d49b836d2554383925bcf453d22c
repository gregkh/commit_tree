qede: refactor XDP Tx processing

Current XDP Tx logic is suboptimal and can't be reused for XDP_REDIRECT
path.
Make qede_xdp_{tx_int,xmit}() more universal and effective in general to
allow future expanding.

Misc: use unlikely() hints where appropriate and replace "fallthrough"
comments with pseudo-keywords.
