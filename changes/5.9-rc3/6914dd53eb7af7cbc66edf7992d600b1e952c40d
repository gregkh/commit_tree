crypto: ecc - SP800-56A rev 3 local public key validation

After the generation of a local public key, SP800-56A rev 3 section
5.6.2.1.3 mandates a validation of that key with a full validation
compliant to section 5.6.2.3.3.

Only if the full validation passes, the key is allowed to be used.

The patch adds the full key validation compliant to 5.6.2.3.3 and
performs the required check on the generated public key.
