Revert "dma-buf: Report signaled links inside dma-fence-chain"

This reverts commit 5de376bb434f80a13138f0ebedc8351ab73d8b0d.

This change breaks synchronization of a timeline.
dma_fence_chain_find_seqno() might be a bit of a confusing name but
this function is not trying to find a particular seqno, is supposed to
give a fence to wait on for a particular point in the timeline.

In a timeline, a particular value is reached when all the points up to
and including that value have signaled.
