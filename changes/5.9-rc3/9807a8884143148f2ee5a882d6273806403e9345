dt-bindings: watchdog: Convert DW WDT binding to DT schema

Modern device tree bindings are supposed to be created as YAML-files
in accordance with dt-schema. This commit replaces the DW Watchdog
legacy bare text bindings with YAML file. As before the binding states
that the corresponding dts node is supposed to have a registers
range, a watchdog timer references clock source, optional reset line and
pre-timeout interrupt.
