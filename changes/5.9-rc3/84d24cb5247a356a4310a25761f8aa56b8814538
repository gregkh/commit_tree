drm/i915: Correct discard i915_vma_compare assertion

As a last minute addition, I added an assertion to make sure that the
new i915_vma view would be equal to the discard. However, the positive
encouragement from CI only goes to show that we rarely take this path,
and it wasn't until the post-merge run did we hit the assert -- because
it compared the wrong view. Fixup the copy'n'paste error and compare
against both the old view and the expected new view.
