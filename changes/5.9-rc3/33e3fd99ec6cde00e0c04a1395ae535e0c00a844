iwlwifi: Extended Key ID support for mvm and dvm

All iwlwifi cards below the 22000 series are able to handle multiple
keyids per STA and allow the selection of the encryption key per MPDU.

These are therefore fully compatible with the Extended Key ID support
implementation in mac80211.

Enable Extended Key ID support for all dvm cards and the mvm cards not
using the incompatible new Tx API introduced for the 22000 series.
