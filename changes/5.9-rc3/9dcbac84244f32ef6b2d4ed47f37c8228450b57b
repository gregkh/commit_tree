software node: Use software_node_unregister() when unregistering group of nodes

After the commit
  46d26819a505 ("software node: implement software_node_unregister()")
has been applied a new helper appears that may be utilised in other places.
For time being there is one such place, i.e. in
software_node_unregister_node_group() which will benefit of the clean up.

Use software_node_unregister() when unregistering group of nodes.
