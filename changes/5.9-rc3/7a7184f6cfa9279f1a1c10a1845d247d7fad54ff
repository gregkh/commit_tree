arm64: dts: rockchip: fix rk3399-puma vcc5v0-host gpio

The puma vcc5v0_host regulator node currently uses opposite active-values
for the enable pin. The gpio-declaration uses active-high while the
separate enable-active-low property marks the pin as active low.

While on the kernel side this works ok, other DT users may get
confused - as seen with uboot right now.

So bring this in line and make both properties match, similar to the
gmac fix.
