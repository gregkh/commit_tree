xfs: Remove kmem_zone_alloc() usage

Use kmem_cache_alloc() directly.

All kmem_zone_alloc() users pass 0 as flags, which are translated into:
GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOWARN, and kmem_zone_alloc() loops forever until the
allocation succeeds.

We can use __GFP_NOFAIL to tell the allocator to loop forever rather
than doing it ourself, and because the allocation will never fail, we do
not need to use __GFP_NOWARN anymore. Hence, all callers can be
converted to use GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_NOFAIL
