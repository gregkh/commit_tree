dt-bindings: clock: Fix YAML schemas for LPASS clocks on SC7180

The YAML schemas that landed forgot one clock: "bi_tcxo".  Presumably
the bindings were developed against the v4 version of the driver and
when the ".name" was removed in v5 of the driver things broke.

While touching this, add the needed includes in each example.  I
believe both examples are supposed to be independent of each other.

Let's fix the bindings.
