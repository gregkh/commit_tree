powerpc/papr_scm: Fetch nvdimm performance stats from PHYP

Update papr_scm.c to query dimm performance statistics from PHYP via
H_SCM_PERFORMANCE_STATS hcall and export them to user-space as PAPR
specific NVDIMM attribute 'perf_stats' in sysfs. The patch also
provide a sysfs ABI documentation for the stats being reported and
their meanings.

During NVDIMM probe time in papr_scm_nvdimm_init() a special variant
of H_SCM_PERFORMANCE_STATS hcall is issued to check if collection of
performance statistics is supported or not. If successful then a PHYP
returns a maximum possible buffer length needed to read all
performance stats. This returned value is stored in a per-nvdimm
attribute 'stat_buffer_len'.

The layout of request buffer for reading NVDIMM performance stats from
PHYP is defined in 'struct papr_scm_perf_stats' and 'struct
papr_scm_perf_stat'. These structs are used in newly introduced
drc_pmem_query_stats() that issues the H_SCM_PERFORMANCE_STATS hcall.

The sysfs access function perf_stats_show() uses value
'stat_buffer_len' to allocate a buffer large enough to hold all
possible NVDIMM performance stats and passes it to
drc_pmem_query_stats() to populate. Finally statistics reported in the
buffer are formatted into the sysfs access function output buffer.
