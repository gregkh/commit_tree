btrfs: don't allocate anonymous block device for user invisible roots

[BUG]
When a lot of subvolumes are created, there is a user report about
transaction aborted:

  BTRFS: Transaction aborted (error -24)

  BTRFS: error (device sda1) in cleanup_transaction:1831: errno=-24 unknown

[CAUSE]
The error is EMFILE (Too many files open) and comes from the anonymous
block device allocation. The ids are in a shared pool of size 1<<20.

The ids are assigned to live subvolumes, ie. the root structure exists
in memory (eg. after creation or after the root appears in some path).
The pool could be exhausted if the numbers are not reclaimed fast
enough, after subvolume deletion or if other system component uses the
anon block devices.

[WORKAROUND]
Since it's not possible to completely solve the problem, we can only
minimize the time the id is allocated to a subvolume root.

Firstly, we can reduce the use of anon_dev by trees that are not
subvolume roots, like data reloc tree.

This patch will do extra check on root objectid, to skip roots that
don't need anon_dev.  Currently it's only data reloc tree and orphan
roots.
