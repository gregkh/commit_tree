s390/bpf: Use brcl for jumping to exit_ip if necessary

"BPF_MAXINSNS: Maximum possible literals" test causes panic with
bpf_jit_harden = 2. The reason is that BPF_JMP | BPF_EXIT is always
emitted as brc, however, after removal of JITed image size
limitations, brcl might be required.

Fix by using brcl when necessary.
