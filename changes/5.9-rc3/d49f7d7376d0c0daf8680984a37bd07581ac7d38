arm64: Move handling of erratum 1418040 into C code

Instead of dealing with erratum 1418040 on each entry and exit,
let's move the handling to __switch_to() instead, which has
several advantages:

- It can be applied when it matters (switching between 32 and 64
  bit tasks).
- It is written in C (yay!)
- It can rely on static keys rather than alternatives
