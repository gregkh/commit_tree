RDMA/bnxt_re: introduce wqe mode to select execution path

The bnxt_re driver need to decide on how much SQ and RQ memory should to
be allocated and which wqe posting/polling algorithm to use.

Making changes to set the wqe-mode to a default value during device
registration sequence. The wqe-mode is passed to the lower layer driver as
well. Going forward in the lower layer driver wqe-mode will be used to
decide execution path. Initializing the wqe-mode to static wqe type for
now.
