scsi: ufs-mediatek: Fix unbalanced clock on/off

MediaTek UFS clocks are separated to two parts and controlled by different
modules: ufs-mediatek and phy-ufs-mediatek.

If both Auto-Hibern8 and clk-gating feature are enabled, mphy power control
is not balanced thus unbalanced control also happens to the clocks probed
by phy-ufs-mediatek module.

Fix this issue by:

 - Promise usage of phy_power_on/off balanced

 - Remove phy_power_on/off control in suspend/resume vops since both can be
   handled in setup_clock vops only
