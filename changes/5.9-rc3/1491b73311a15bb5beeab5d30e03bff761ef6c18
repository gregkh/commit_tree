s390/bpf: Tolerate not converging code shrinking

"BPF_MAXINSNS: Maximum possible literals" unnecessarily falls back to
the interpreter because of failing sanity check in bpf_set_addr. The
problem is that there are a lot of branches that can be shrunk, and
doing so opens up the possibility to shrink even more. This process
does not converge after 3 passes, causing code offsets to change during
the codegen pass, which must never happen.

Fix by inserting nops during codegen pass in order to preserve code
offets.
