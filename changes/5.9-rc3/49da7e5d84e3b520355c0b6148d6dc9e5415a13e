drm: bridge: dw-hdmi: Pass private data pointer to .configure_phy()

The .configure_phy() operation takes a dw_hdmi_plat_data pointer as a
context argument. This differs from .mode_valid() that takes a custom
private context pointer, causing possible confusion. Make the
dw_hdmi_plat_data operations more consistent by passing the private
context pointer to .configure_phy() as well.
