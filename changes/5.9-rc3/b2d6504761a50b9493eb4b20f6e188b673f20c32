perf/x86/lbr: Add interface to get LBR information

The LBR records msrs are model specific. The perf subsystem has already
obtained the base addresses of LBR records based on the cpu model.

Therefore, an interface is added to allow callers outside the perf
subsystem to obtain these LBR information. It's useful for hypervisors
to emulate the LBR feature for guests with less code.
