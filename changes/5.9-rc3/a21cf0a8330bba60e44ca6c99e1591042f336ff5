devlink: Add a new devlink port lanes attribute and pass to netlink

Add a new devlink port attribute that indicates the port's number of lanes.

Drivers are expected to set it via devlink_port_attrs_set(), before
registering the port.

The attribute is not passed to user space in case the number of lanes is
invalid (0).
