tty: serial: fsl_lpuart: minimum baud rate support

The formula for the baud rate is
baud rate = "baud clock / ((OSR+1) Ã— SBR)

Algorithm used in function lpuart32_serial_setbrg() only changes
the SBR. Even with maxmum value put in, OSR stays at 0x7 and the
lowest baud rate would be ~ 2600 bps

Update the algorithm to allow driver operation at 1200,2400 or 600 bps
