drm/panfrost: Fix inbalance of devfreq record_busy/idle()

The calls to panfrost_devfreq_record_busy() and
panfrost_devfreq_record_idle() must be balanced to ensure that the
devfreq utilisation is correctly reported. But there are two cases where
this doesn't work correctly.

In panfrost_job_hw_submit() if pm_runtime_get_sync() fails or the
WARN_ON() fires then no call to panfrost_devfreq_record_busy() is made,
but when the job times out the corresponding _record_idle() call is
still made in panfrost_job_timedout(). Move the call up to ensure that
it always happens.

Secondly panfrost_job_timedout() only makes a single call to
panfrost_devfreq_record_idle() even if it is cleaning up multiple jobs.
Move the call inside the loop to ensure that the number of
_record_idle() calls matches the number of _record_busy() calls.
