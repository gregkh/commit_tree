dmaengine: dw: Initialize min and max burst DMA device capability

According to the DW APB DMAC data book the minimum burst transaction
length is 1 and it's true for any version of the controller since
isn't parametrised in the coreAssembler so can't be changed at the
IP-core synthesis stage. The maximum burst transaction can vary from
channel to channel and from controller to controller depending on a
IP-core parameter the system engineer activated during the IP-core
synthesis. Let's initialise both min_burst and max_burst members of the
DMA controller descriptor with extreme values so the DMA clients could
use them to properly optimize the DMA requests. The channels and
controller-specific max_burst length initialization will be introduced
by the follow-up patches.
