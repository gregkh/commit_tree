selftests/bpf: Add a test for out of bound rdonly buf access

If the bpf program contains out of bound access w.r.t. a
particular map key/value size, the verification will be
still okay, e.g., it will be accepted by verifier. But
it will be rejected during link_create time. A test
is added here to ensure link_create failure did happen
if out of bound access happened.
  $ ./test_progs -n 4
  ...
  #4/23 rdonly-buf-out-of-bound:OK
  ...
