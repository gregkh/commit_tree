sched, vmlinux.lds: Increase STRUCT_ALIGNMENT to 64 bytes for GCC-4.9

For some mysterious reason GCC-4.9 has a 64 byte section alignment for
structures, all other GCC versions (and Clang) tested (including 4.8
and 5.0) are fine with the 32 bytes alignment.

Getting this right is important for the new SCHED_DATA macro that
creates an explicitly ordered array of 'struct sched_class' in the
linker script and expect pointer arithmetic to work.
