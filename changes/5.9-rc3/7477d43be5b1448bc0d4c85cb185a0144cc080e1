s390/bpf: Fix sign extension in branch_ku

Both signed and unsigned variants of BPF_JMP | BPF_K require
sign-extending the immediate. JIT emits cgfi for the signed case,
which is correct, and clgfi for the unsigned case, which is not
correct: clgfi zero-extends the immediate.

s390 does not provide an instruction that does sign-extension and
unsigned comparison at the same time. Therefore, fix by first loading
the sign-extended immediate into work register REG_1 and proceeding
as if it's BPF_X.
