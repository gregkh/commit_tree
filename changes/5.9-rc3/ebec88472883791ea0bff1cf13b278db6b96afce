drm/nouveau/kms/nv50-: Expose nv50_outp_atom in disp.h

In order to make sure that we flush disable updates at the right time
when disabling CRCs, we'll need to be able to look at the outp state to
see if we're changing it at the same time that we're disabling CRCs.

So, expose the struct in disp.h.
