drm/i915/tgl: Make sure TC-cold is blocked before enabling TC AUX power wells

The dependency between power wells is determined by the ordering of the
power well list: when enabling the power wells for a domain, this
happens walking the power well list forward, while disabling them
happens in the reverse direction. Accordingly a power well on the list
must follow any other power well it depends on.

Since the TC AUX power wells depend on TC-cold being blocked, move the
TC-cold off power well before all AUX power wells.
