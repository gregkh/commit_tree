btrfs: remove no longer used log_list member of struct btrfs_ordered_extent

The 'log_list' member of an ordered extent was used keep track of which
ordered extents we needed to wait after logging metadata, but is not used
anymore since commit 5636cf7d6dc86f ("btrfs: remove the logged extents
infrastructure"), as we now always wait on ordered extent completion
before logging metadata. So just remove it since it's doing nothing and
making each ordered extent structure waste more memory (2 pointers).
