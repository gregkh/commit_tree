xfs: mark dquot buffers in cache

dquot buffers always have write IO callbacks, so by marking them
directly we can avoid needing to attach ->b_iodone functions to
them. This avoids an indirect call, and makes future modifications
much simpler.

This is largely a rearrangement of the code at this point - no IO
completion functionality changes at this point, just how the
code is run is modified.
