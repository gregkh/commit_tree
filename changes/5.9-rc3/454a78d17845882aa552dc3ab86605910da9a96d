net: phy: clean up cortina workaround

Move the Cortina PHY workaround out of the "devices in package" loop;
it doesn't need to be in there as the control flow will terminate the
loop once we enter the workaround irrespective of the workaround's
outcome. The workaround is triggered by the ID being mostly 1's, which
will in any case terminate the loop.
