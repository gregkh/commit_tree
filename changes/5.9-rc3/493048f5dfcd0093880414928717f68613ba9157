l2tp: WARN_ON rather than BUG_ON in l2tp_session_queue_purge

l2tp_session_queue_purge is used during session shutdown to drop any
skbs queued for reordering purposes according to L2TP dataplane rules.

The BUG_ON in this function checks the session magic feather in an
attempt to catch lifetime bugs.

Rather than crashing the kernel with a BUG_ON, we can simply WARN_ON and
refuse to do anything more -- in the worst case this could result in a
leak.  However this is highly unlikely given that the session purge only
occurs from codepaths which have obtained the session by means of a lookup
via. the parent tunnel and which check the session "dead" flag to
protect against shutdown races.

While we're here, have l2tp_session_queue_purge return void rather than
an integer, since neither of the callsites checked the return value.
