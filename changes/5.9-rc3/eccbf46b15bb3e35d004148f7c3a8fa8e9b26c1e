brcmfmac: keep SDIO watchdog running when console_interval is non-zero

brcmfmac host driver makes SDIO bus sleep and stops SDIO watchdog if no
pending event or data. As a result, host driver does not poll firmware
console buffer before buffer overflow, which leads to missing firmware
logs. We should not stop SDIO watchdog if console_interval is non-zero
in debug build.
