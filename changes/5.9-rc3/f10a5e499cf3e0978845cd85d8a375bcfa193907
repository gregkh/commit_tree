regulator: tps65217-regulator: Remove pointless 'is unsigned int <0' check

'rid' is declared as unsigned int, so there is little point checking for <0.

Removing these checks fixes the following W=1 warnings:

 drivers/regulator/tps65217-regulator.c: In function ‘tps65217_pmic_set_suspend_enable’:
 drivers/regulator/tps65217-regulator.c:127:10: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false [-Wtype-limits]
 127 | if (rid < TPS65217_DCDC_1 || rid > TPS65217_LDO_4)
 | ^
 drivers/regulator/tps65217-regulator.c: In function ‘tps65217_pmic_set_suspend_disable’:
 drivers/regulator/tps65217-regulator.c:140:10: warning: comparison of unsigned expression < 0 is always false [-Wtype-limits]
 140 | if (rid < TPS65217_DCDC_1 || rid > TPS65217_LDO_4)
 | ^
