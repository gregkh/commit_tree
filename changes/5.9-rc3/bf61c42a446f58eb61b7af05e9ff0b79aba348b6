ALSA: hda: generic: Always call led-trigger for mic mute LED

Instead of adding a special hook to trigger the mic-mute LED device,
call it always from the common callback function.  It won't hurt even
if no corresponding led cdev is present.

This is basically a preliminary change for the later patches to
convert the all mic-mute LED handling to LED class cdev.
