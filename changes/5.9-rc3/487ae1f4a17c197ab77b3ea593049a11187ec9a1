tools lib traceevent: Add support for more printk format specifiers

The printk format specifiers used in event's print format files extend
the standard printf formats. There are a lot of new options related to
printing pointers and kernel specific structures. Currently trace-cmd
does not support many of them.

Support for these new printk specifiers is added to the pretty_print()
function:

 - UUID/GUID address: %pU[bBlL]
 - Raw buffer as a hex string: %*ph[CDN]

These are improved:

 - MAC address: %pMF, %pM and %pmR
 - IPv4 adderss: %p[Ii]4[hnbl]

Function pretty_print() is refactored. The logic for printing pointers
%p[...] is moved to its own function.
