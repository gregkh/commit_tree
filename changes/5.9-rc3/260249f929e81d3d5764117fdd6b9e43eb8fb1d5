clk: vc5: Enable addition output configurations of the Versaclock

The existing driver is expecting the Versaclock to be pre-programmed,
and only sets the output frequency.  Unfortunately, not all devices
are pre-programmed, and the Versaclock chip has more options beyond
just the frequency.

This patch enables the following additional features:

   - Programmable voltage: 1.8V, 2.5V, or 3.3Vâ€‹
   - Slew Percentage of normal: 85%, 90%, or 100%
   - Output Type: LVPECL, CMOS, HCSL, or LVDS
