drm/shmem-helpers: Don't call get/put_pages on imported dma-buf in vmap

There's no direct harm, because for the shmem helpers these are noops
on imported buffers. The trouble is in the locks these take - I want
to change dma_buf_vmap locking, and so need to make sure that we only
ever take certain locks on one side of the dma-buf interface: Either
for exporters, or for importers.
