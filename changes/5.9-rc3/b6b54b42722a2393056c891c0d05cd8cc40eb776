powerpc/sstep: Add tests for prefixed integer load/stores

Add tests for the prefixed versions of the integer load/stores that
are currently tested. This includes the following instructions:
  * Prefixed Load Doubleword (pld)
  * Prefixed Load Word and Zero (plwz)
  * Prefixed Store Doubleword (pstd)

Skip the new tests if ISA v3.1 is unsupported.
