powerpc/kernel: Cleanup machine check function declarations

__machine_check_early_realmode_p*() are currently declared as extern
in cputable.c and because of this when compiled with "C=1" (which
enables semantic checker) produces these warnings.

    CHECK   arch/powerpc/kernel/mce_power.c
  arch/powerpc/kernel/mce_power.c:709:6: warning: symbol '__machine_check_early_realmode_p7' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/powerpc/kernel/mce_power.c:717:6: warning: symbol '__machine_check_early_realmode_p8' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/powerpc/kernel/mce_power.c:722:6: warning: symbol '__machine_check_early_realmode_p9' was not declared. Should it be static?
  arch/powerpc/kernel/mce_power.c:740:6: warning: symbol '__machine_check_early_realmode_p10' was not declared. Should it be static?

Patch here moves the declaration to asm/mce.h and includes the same in
cputable.c
