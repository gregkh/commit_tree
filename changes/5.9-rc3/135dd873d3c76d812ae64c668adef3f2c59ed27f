spi: stm32h7: fix race condition at end of transfer

The caller of stm32_spi_transfer_one(), spi_transfer_one_message(),
is waiting for us to call spi_finalize_current_transfer() and will
eventually schedule a new transfer, if available.
We should guarantee that the spi controller is really available
before calling spi_finalize_current_transfer().

Move the call to spi_finalize_current_transfer() _after_ the call
to stm32_spi_disable().
