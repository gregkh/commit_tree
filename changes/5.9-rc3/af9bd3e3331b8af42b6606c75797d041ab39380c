samples: bpf: Fix bpf programs with kprobe/sys_connect event

Currently, BPF programs with kprobe/sys_connect does not work properly.

Commit 34745aed515c ("samples/bpf: fix kprobe attachment issue on x64")
This commit modifies the bpf_load behavior of kprobe events in the x64
architecture. If the current kprobe event target starts with "sys_*",
add the prefix "__x64_" to the front of the event.

Appending "__x64_" prefix with kprobe/sys_* event was appropriate as a
solution to most of the problems caused by the commit below.

    commit d5a00528b58c ("syscalls/core, syscalls/x86: Rename struct
    pt_regs-based sys_*() to __x64_sys_*()")

However, there is a problem with the sys_connect kprobe event that does
not work properly. For __sys_connect event, parameters can be fetched
normally, but for __x64_sys_connect, parameters cannot be fetched.

    ffffffff818d3520 <__x64_sys_connect>:
    ffffffff818d3520: e8 fb df 32 00        callq   0xffffffff81c01520
    <__fentry__>
    ffffffff818d3525: 48 8b 57 60           movq    96(%rdi), %rdx
    ffffffff818d3529: 48 8b 77 68           movq    104(%rdi), %rsi
    ffffffff818d352d: 48 8b 7f 70           movq    112(%rdi), %rdi
    ffffffff818d3531: e8 1a ff ff ff        callq   0xffffffff818d3450
    <__sys_connect>
    ffffffff818d3536: 48 98                 cltq
    ffffffff818d3538: c3                    retq
    ffffffff818d3539: 0f 1f 80 00 00 00 00  nopl    (%rax)

As the assembly code for __x64_sys_connect shows, parameters should be
fetched and set into rdi, rsi, rdx registers prior to calling
__sys_connect.

Because of this problem, this commit fixes the sys_connect event by
first getting the value of the rdi register and then the value of the
rdi, rsi, and rdx register through an offset based on that value.
