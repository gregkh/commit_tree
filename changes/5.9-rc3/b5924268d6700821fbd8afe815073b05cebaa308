soundwire: extend SDW_SLAVE_ENTRY

The SoundWire 1.2 specification adds new capabilities that were not
present in previous version, such as the class ID.

To enable support for class drivers, and well as drivers that address
a specific version, all fields of the sdw_device_id structure need to
be exposed. For SoundWire 1.0 and 1.1 devices, a wildcard is used so
class and version information are ignored.
