powerpc/eeh: Remove eeh_dev_phb_init_dynamic()

This function is a one line wrapper around eeh_phb_pe_create() and despite
the name it doesn't create any eeh_dev structures. Replace it with direct
calls to eeh_phb_pe_create() since that does what it says on the tin
and removes a layer of indirection.
