refperf: Convert reader_task structure's "start" field to int

This commit converts the reader_task structure's "start" field to int
in order to demote a full barrier to an smp_load_acquire() and also to
simplify the code a bit.  While in the area, and to enlist the compiler's
help in ensuring that nothing was missed, the field's name was changed
to start_reader.

Also while in the area, change the main_func() store to use
smp_store_release() to further fortify against wait/wake races.
