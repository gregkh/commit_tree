usb: xhci: Fix ASMedia ASM1142 DMA addressing

I've confirmed that the ASMedia ASM1142 has the same problem as the
ASM2142/ASM3142, in that it too reports that it supports 64-bit DMA
addresses when in fact it does not. As with the ASM2142/ASM3142, this
can cause problems on systems where the upper bits matter, and adding
the XHCI_NO_64BIT_SUPPORT quirk completely fixes the issue.
