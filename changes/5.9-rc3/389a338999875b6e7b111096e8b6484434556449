net: phy: read MMD ID from all present MMDs

Expand the device_ids[] array to allow all MMD IDs to be read rather
than just the first 8 MMDs, but only read the ID if the MDIO_STAT2
register reports that a device really is present here for these new
devices to maintain compatibility with our current behaviour.  Note
that only a limited number of devices have MDIO_STAT2.

88X3310 PHY vendor MMDs do are marked as present in the
devices_in_package, but do not contain IEE 802.3 compatible register
sets in their lower space.  This avoids reading incorrect values as MMD
identifiers.
