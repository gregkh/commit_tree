mt76: mt7663u: sync probe sampling with rate configuration

On usb device rate configuration for sampling is performed relying on a
workqueue since it is not possible to access the device in the interrupt
context. Move the configuration of the probe_rate flag in the workqueue
in order to keep probe sampling in sync with actual rate configuration
