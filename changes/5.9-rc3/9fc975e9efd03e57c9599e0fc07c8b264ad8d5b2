x86/kvm/svm: Add hardirq tracing on guest enter/exit

Entering guest mode is more or less the same as returning to user
space. From an instrumentation point of view both leave kernel mode and the
transition to guest or user mode reenables interrupts on the host. In user
mode an interrupt is served directly and in guest mode it causes a VM exit
which then handles or reinjects the interrupt.

The transition from guest mode or user mode to kernel mode disables
interrupts, which needs to be recorded in instrumentation to set the
correct state again.

This is important for e.g. latency analysis because otherwise the execution
time in guest or user mode would be wrongly accounted as interrupt disabled
and could trigger false positives.

Add hardirq tracing to guest enter/exit functions in the same way as it
is done in the user mode enter/exit code, respecting the RCU requirements.
