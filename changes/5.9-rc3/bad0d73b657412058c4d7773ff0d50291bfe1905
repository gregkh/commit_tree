firmware: arm_scmi: Use signed integer to report transfer status

Currently the trace event 'scmi_xfer_end' reports the status of the
transfer using the unsigned status field read from the firmware which
may not be easy to interpret. It may also miss to emit any timeouts
that happen in the driver resulting in emitting garbage in the status
field in those scenarios.

Let us use signed integer so that error values are emitted out after
they are mapped from firmware error formats to standard linux error
codes. While at this, also include any timeouts in the driver itself.
