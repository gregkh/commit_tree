block: add max_open_zones to blk-sysfs

Add a new max_open_zones definition in the sysfs documentation.
This definition will be common for all devices utilizing the zoned block
device support in the kernel.

Export max open zones according to this new definition for NVMe Zoned
Namespace devices, ZAC ATA devices (which are treated as SCSI devices by
the kernel), and ZBC SCSI devices.

Add the new max_open_zones member to struct request_queue, rather
than as a queue limit, since this property cannot be split across stacking
drivers.
