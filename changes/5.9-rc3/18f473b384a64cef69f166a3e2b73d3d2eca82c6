ceph: periodically send perf metrics to MDSes

This will send the caps/read/write/metadata metrics to any available MDS
once per second, which will be the same as the userland client.  It will
skip the MDS sessions which don't support the metric collection, as the
MDSs will close socket connections when they get an unknown type
message.

We can disable the metric sending via the disable_send_metrics module
parameter.
