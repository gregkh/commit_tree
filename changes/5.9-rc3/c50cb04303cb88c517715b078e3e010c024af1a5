KVM: arm64: Remove __hyp_text macro, use build rules instead

With nVHE code now fully separated from the rest of the kernel, the effects of
the __hyp_text macro (which had to be applied on all nVHE code) can be
achieved with build rules instead. The macro used to:
  (a) move code to .hyp.text ELF section, now done by renaming .text using
      `objcopy`, and
  (b) `notrace` and `__noscs` would negate effects of CC_FLAGS_FTRACE and
      CC_FLAGS_SCS, respectivelly, now those flags are  erased from
      KBUILD_CFLAGS (same way as in EFI stub).

Note that by removing __hyp_text from code shared with VHE, all VHE code is now
compiled into .text and without `notrace` and `__noscs`.

Use of '.pushsection .hyp.text' removed from assembly files as this is now also
covered by the build rules.

For MAINTAINERS: if needed to re-run, uses of macro were removed with the
following command. Formatting was fixed up manually.

  find arch/arm64/kvm/hyp -type f -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' \
       -exec sed -i 's/ __hyp_text//g' {} +
