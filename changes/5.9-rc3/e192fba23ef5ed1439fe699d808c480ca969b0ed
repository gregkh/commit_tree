drm/dsi: use stack buffer in mipi_dsi_dcs_write()

Currently the function heap allocates when we have any payload. Where in
many case the payload is 1 byte - ouch.

>From casual observation, vast majority of the payloads are smaller than
8 bytes - so use a stack array tx[8] to avoid the senseless kmalloc and
kfree dance.
