thermal: core: Fix thermal zone lookup by ID

When a thermal zone is looked up by an ID and no zone is found matching
that ID, the thermal_zone_get_by_id() function will return a pointer to
the thermal zone list head which isn't actually a valid thermal zone.

This can lead to a subsequent crash because a valid pointer is returned
to the called, but dereferencing that pointer as struct thermal_zone is
not safe.
