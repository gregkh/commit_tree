copy_regset_to_user(): do all copyout at once.

Turn copy_regset_to_user() into regset_get_alloc() + copy_to_user().
Now all ->get() calls have a kernel buffer as destination.

Note that we'd already eliminated the callers of copy_regset_to_user()
with non-zero offset; now that argument is simply unused.

Uninlined, while we are at it.
