ARM: 8989/1: use .fpu assembler directives instead of assembler arguments

Explicit FPU selection has been introduced in commit 1a6be26d5b1a
("[ARM] Enable VFP to be built when non-VFP capable CPUs are selected")
to make use of assembler mnemonics for VFP instructions.

However, clang currently does not support passing assembler flags
like this and errors out with:
clang-10: error: the clang compiler does not support '-Wa,-mfpu=softvfp+vfp'

Make use of the .fpu assembler directives to select the floating point
hardware selectively. Also use the new unified assembler language
mnemonics. This allows to build these procedures with Clang.
