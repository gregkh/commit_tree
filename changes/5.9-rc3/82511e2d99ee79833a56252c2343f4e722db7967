usb: host: pci-quirks: Demote function header from kerneldoc to comment block

quirk_usb_handoff_xhci()'s function header is the only one across
the sourcefile which is denoted as a kerneldoc header.  Despite
no attempt to document its arguments.  Drop it down in status from
kerneldoc to a standard comment block to match the other headers
in the file.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning:

 drivers/usb/host/pci-quirks.c:1145: warning: Function parameter or member 'pdev' not described in 'quirk_usb_handoff_xhci'
