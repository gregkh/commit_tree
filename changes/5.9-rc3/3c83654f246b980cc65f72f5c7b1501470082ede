net: mscc: ocelot: rename ocelot_ace.{c, h} to ocelot_vcap.{c,h}

Access Control Lists (and their respective Access Control Entries) are
specifically entries in the VCAP IS2, the security enforcement block,
according to the documentation.

Let's rename the files that deal with generic operations on the VCAP
TCAM, so that VCAP IS1 and ES0 can reuse the same code without
confusion.
