rcu/tree: Keep kfree_rcu() awake during lock contention

On PREEMPT_RT kernels, the krcp spinlock gets converted to an rt-mutex
and causes kfree_rcu() callers to sleep. This makes it unusable for
callers in purely atomic sections such as non-threaded IRQ handlers and
raw spinlock sections. Fix it by converting the spinlock to a raw
spinlock.

Vetting all code paths, there is no reason to believe that the raw
spinlock will hurt RT latencies as it is not held for a long time.
