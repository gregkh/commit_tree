powerpc/eeh: Move vf_index out of pci_dn and into eeh_dev

Drivers that do not support the PCI error handling callbacks are handled by
tearing down the device and re-probing them. If the device being removed is
a virtual function then we need to know the VF index so it can be removed
using the pci_iov_{add|remove}_virtfn() API.

Currently this is handled by looking up the pci_dn, and using the vf_index
that was stashed there when the pci_dn for the VF was created in
pcibios_sriov_enable(). We would like to eliminate the use of pci_dn
outside of pseries though so we need to provide the generic EEH code with
some other way to find the vf_index.

The easiest thing to do here is move the vf_index field out of pci_dn and
into eeh_dev.  Currently pci_dn and eeh_dev are allocated and initialized
together so this is a fairly minimal change in preparation for splitting
pci_dn and eeh_dev in the future.
