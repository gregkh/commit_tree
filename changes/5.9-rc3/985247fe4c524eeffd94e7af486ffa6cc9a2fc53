xhci: dbc: Use dev_info() and similar instead of xhci_info()

To make this change possible we also need to change
dbc_handle_port_status() to take dbc pointer as parameter instead of
xhci_hcd pointer.

Note that xhci_info() used xhci_to_hcd(xhci)->self.controller as the
device while for dev_info we use xhci_to_hcd(xhci)->self.sysdev.

In many cases those are the same, but not for some device where
a dwc3 controller creates a xhci platform device. In th this case
self.controller may be the platform device while self.sysdev is
the actual device known to firmware (dwc3).

This change helps decoupling xhci and DbC
