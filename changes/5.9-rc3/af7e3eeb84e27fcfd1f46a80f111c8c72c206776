pinctrl: intel: Disable input and output buffer when switching to GPIO

It's possible scenario that pin has been in different mode, while
the respective GPIO register has a leftover output buffer enabled.
In such case when we request GPIO it will switch to GPIO mode, and
thus to output with unknown value, followed by switching to input
mode. This can produce a glitch on the pin.

Disable input and output buffer when switching to GPIO to avoid
potential glitches.
