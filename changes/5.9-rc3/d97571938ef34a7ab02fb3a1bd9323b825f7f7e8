drm/i915/sdvo: Make SDVO deal with HDMI pixel repeat

With SDVO the pipe config pixel_multiplier only concerns itself with the
data on the SDVO bus. Any HDMI specific pixel repeat must be handled by
the SDVO device itself. To do that simply configure the SDVO pixel
replication factor appropriately. We already set up the infoframe PRB
values correctly via the infoframe helpers.

There is no cap we can check for this. The spec says that 1X,2X,4X are
mandatory, anything else is optional. 1X and 2X are all we need so
we should be able to assume they work.
