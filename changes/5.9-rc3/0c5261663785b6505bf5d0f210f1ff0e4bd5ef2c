regulator: wm8400-regulator: Repair dodgy kerneldoc header formatting

W=1 kernel builds report a lack of descriptions for various
function arguments.  In reality they are documented, but the
formatting was not as expected '@.*:'.  Instead, some weird
arg identifiers were used.

This change fixes the following warnings:

 drivers/regulator/wm8400-regulator.c:243: warning: Function parameter or member 'dev' not described in 'wm8400_register_regulator'
 drivers/regulator/wm8400-regulator.c:243: warning: Function parameter or member 'reg' not described in 'wm8400_register_regulator'
 drivers/regulator/wm8400-regulator.c:243: warning: Function parameter or member 'initdata' not described in 'wm8400_register_regulator'
