cfg80211: invert HE BSS color 'disabled' to 'enabled'

This is in fact 'disabled' in the spec, but there it's in a
place where that actually makes sense. In our internal data
structures, it doesn't really make sense, and in fact the
previous commit just fixed a bug in that area.

Make this safer by inverting the polarity from 'disabled' to
'enabled'.
