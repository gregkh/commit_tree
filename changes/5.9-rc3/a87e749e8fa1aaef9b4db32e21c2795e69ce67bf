sched: Remove struct sched_class::next field

Now that the sched_class descriptors are defined in order via the linker
script vmlinux.lds.h, there's no reason to have a "next" pointer to the
previous priroity structure. The order of the sturctures can be aligned as
an array, and used to index and find the next sched_class descriptor.
