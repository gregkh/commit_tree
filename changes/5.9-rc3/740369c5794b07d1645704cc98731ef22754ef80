docs: crypto: descore-readme.txt: convert to ReST format

Convert this readme file to ReST file format, preserving its
contents as-is as much as possible. The only changes are:

- Added chapter and title markups;
- Added blank lines where needed;
- Added list markups where needed;
- Use a table markup;
- replace markups like `foo' to ``foo``;
- add one extra literal markup to avoid warnings.
