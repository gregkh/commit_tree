xfs: clean up whacky buffer log item list reinit

When we've emptied the buffer log item list, it does a list_del_init
on itself to reset it's pointers to itself. This is unnecessary as
the list is already empty at this point - it was a left-over
fragment from the list_head conversion of the buffer log item list.
Remove them.
