arm64/hugetlb: Reserve CMA areas for gigantic pages on 16K and 64K configs

Currently 'hugetlb_cma=' command line argument does not create CMA area on
ARM64_16K_PAGES and ARM64_64K_PAGES based platforms. Instead, it just ends
up with the following warning message. Reason being, hugetlb_cma_reserve()
never gets called for these huge page sizes.

[   64.255669] hugetlb_cma: the option isn't supported by current arch

This enables CMA areas reservation on ARM64_16K_PAGES and ARM64_64K_PAGES
configs by defining an unified arm64_hugetlb_cma_reseve() that is wrapped
in CONFIG_CMA. Call site for arm64_hugetlb_cma_reserve() is also protected
as <asm/hugetlb.h> is conditionally included and hence cannot contain stub
for the inverse config i.e !(CONFIG_HUGETLB_PAGE && CONFIG_CMA).
