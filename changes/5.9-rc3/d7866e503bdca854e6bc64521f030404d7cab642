crypto: x86 - Remove include/asm/inst.h

Current minimum required version of binutils is 2.23,
which supports PSHUFB, PCLMULQDQ, PEXTRD, AESKEYGENASSIST,
AESIMC, AESENC, AESENCLAST, AESDEC, AESDECLAST and MOVQ
instruction mnemonics.

Substitute macros from include/asm/inst.h with a proper
instruction mnemonics in various assmbly files from
x86/crypto directory, and remove now unneeded file.

The patch was tested by calculating and comparing sha256sum
hashes of stripped object files before and after the patch,
to be sure that executable code didn't change.
