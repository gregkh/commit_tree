spi: stm32: clear only asserted irq flags on interrupt

Previously the stm32h7 interrupt thread cleared all non-masked interrupts.
If an interrupt was to occur during the handling of another interrupt its
flag would be unset, resulting in a lost interrupt.
This patches fixes the issue by clearing only the currently set interrupt
flags.
