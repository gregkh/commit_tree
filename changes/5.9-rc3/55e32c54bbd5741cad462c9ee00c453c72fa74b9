fscrypt: don't load ->i_crypt_info before it's known to be valid

In fscrypt_set_bio_crypt_ctx(), ->i_crypt_info isn't known to be
non-NULL until we check fscrypt_inode_uses_inline_crypto().  So, load
->i_crypt_info after the check rather than before.  This makes no
difference currently, but it prevents people from introducing bugs where
the pointer is dereferenced when it may be NULL.
