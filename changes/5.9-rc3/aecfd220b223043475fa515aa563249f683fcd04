x86/mm/numa: Remove uninitialized_var() usage

Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
(or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings (e.g.
"unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized, either
simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes. As a precursor
to removing[2] this[3] macro[4], refactor code to avoid its need.

The original reason for its use here was to work around the #ifdef
being the only place the variable was used. This is better expressed
using IS_ENABLED() and a new code block where the variable can be used
unconditionally.
