sfc: null out channel->rps_flow_id after freeing it

If an ef100_net_open() fails, ef100_net_stop() may be called without
 channel->rps_flow_id having been written; thus it may hold the address
 freed by a previous ef100_net_stop()'s call to efx_remove_filters().
 This then causes a double-free when efx_remove_filters() is called
 again, leading to a panic.
To prevent this, after freeing it, overwrite it with NULL.
