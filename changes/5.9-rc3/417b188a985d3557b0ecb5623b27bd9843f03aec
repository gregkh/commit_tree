ARM: dts: rockchip: Add USB for RockPI N8/N10

Radxa dalang carrier board has 2x USB 2.0 and 1x USB 3.0
ports.

This patch adds support to enable all these USB ports for
N10 and N8 combinations SBCs.

Note that the USB 3.0 port on RockPI N8 combination works
as USB 2.0 OTG since it is driven from RK3288.
