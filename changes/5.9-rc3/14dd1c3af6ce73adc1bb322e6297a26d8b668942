clk: st: Remove uninitialized_var() usage

Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
(or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings (e.g.
"unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized, either
simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes. As a precursor
to removing[2] this[3] macro[4], just remove this variable since it was
actually unused:

drivers/clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c: In function ‘quadfs_set_rate’:
drivers/clk/st/clkgen-fsyn.c:793:6: warning: unused variable ‘i’ [-Wunused-variable]
  793 |  int i;
      |      ^
