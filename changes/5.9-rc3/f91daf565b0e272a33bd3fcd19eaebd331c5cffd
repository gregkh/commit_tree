io_uring: short circuit -EAGAIN for blocking read attempt

One case was missed in the short IO retry handling, and that's hitting
-EAGAIN on a blocking attempt read (eg from io-wq context). This is a
problem on sockets that are marked as non-blocking when created, they
don't carry any REQ_F_NOWAIT information to help us terminate them
instead of perpetually retrying.
