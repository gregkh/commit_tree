of/irq: Make of_msi_map_rid() PCI bus agnostic

There is nothing PCI bus specific in the of_msi_map_rid()
implementation other than the requester ID tag for the input
ID space. Rename requester ID to a more generic ID so that
the translation code can be used by all busses that require
input/output ID translations.

No functional change intended.
