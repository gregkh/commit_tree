ceph: set sec_context xattr on symlink creation

Symlink inodes should have the security context set in their xattrs on
creation. We already set the context on creation, but we don't attach
the pagelist. The effect is that symlink inodes don't get an SELinux
context set on them at creation, so they end up unlabeled instead of
inheriting the proper context. Make it do so.
