ipv6: fib6: avoid indirect calls from fib6_rule_lookup

It was reported that a considerable amount of cycles were spent on the
expensive indirect calls on fib6_rule_lookup. This patch introduces an
inline helper called pol_route_func that uses the indirect_call_wrappers
to avoid the indirect calls.

This patch saves around 50ns per call.

Performance was measured on the receiver by checking the amount of
syncookies that server was able to generate under a synflood load.

Traffic was generated using trafgen[1] which was pushing around 1Mpps on
a single queue. Receiver was using only one rx queue which help to
create a bottle neck and make the experiment rx-bounded.

These are the syncookies generated over 10s from the different runs:
