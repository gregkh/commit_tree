dyndbg: fix a BUG_ON in ddebug_describe_flags

ddebug_describe_flags() currently fills a caller provided string buffer,
after testing its size (also passed) in a BUG_ON.  Fix this by
replacing them with a known-big-enough string buffer wrapped in a
struct, and passing that instead.

Also simplify ddebug_describe_flags() flags parameter from a struct to
a member in that struct, and hoist the member deref up to the caller.
This makes the function reusable (soon) where flags are unpacked.
