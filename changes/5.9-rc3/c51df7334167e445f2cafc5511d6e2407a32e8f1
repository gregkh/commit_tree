xfs: stop using q_core.d_id in the quota code

Add a dquot id field to the incore dquot, and use that instead of the
one in qcore.  This eliminates a bunch of endian conversions and will
eventually allow us to remove qcore entirely.

We also rearrange the start of xfs_dquot to remove padding holes, saving
8 bytes.
