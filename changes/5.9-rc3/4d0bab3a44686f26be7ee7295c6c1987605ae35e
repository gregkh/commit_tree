xfs: remove SYNC_WAIT from xfs_reclaim_inodes()

Clean up xfs_reclaim_inodes() callers. Most callers want blocking
behaviour, so just make the existing SYNC_WAIT behaviour the
default.

For the xfs_reclaim_worker(), just call xfs_reclaim_inodes_ag()
directly because we just want optimistic clean inode reclaim to be
done in the background.

For xfs_quiesce_attr() we can just remove the inode reclaim calls as
they are a historic relic that was required to flush dirty inodes
that contained unlogged changes. We now log all changes to the
inodes, so the sync AIL push from xfs_log_quiesce() called by
xfs_quiesce_attr() will do all the required inode writeback for
freeze.

Seeing as we now want to loop until all reclaimable inodes have been
reclaimed, make xfs_reclaim_inodes() loop on the XFS_ICI_RECLAIM_TAG
tag rather than having xfs_reclaim_inodes_ag() tell it that inodes
were skipped. This is much more reliable and will always loop until
all reclaimable inodes are reclaimed.
