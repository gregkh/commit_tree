lib/vsprintf: Replace custom spec to print decimals with generic one

When printing phandle via %pOFp the custom spec is used. First of all,
it has a SMALL flag which makes no sense for decimal numbers. Second,
we have already default spec for decimal numbers. Use the latter in
the %pOFp case as well.
