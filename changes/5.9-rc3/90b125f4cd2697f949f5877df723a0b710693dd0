hv_utils: return error if host timesysnc update is stale

If for any reason, host timesync messages were not processed by
the guest, hv_ptp_gettime() returns a stale value and the
caller (clock_gettime, PTP ioctl etc) has no means to know this
now. Return an error so that the caller knows about this.
