tools/bpftool: Make skeleton code C++17-friendly by dropping typeof()

Seems like C++17 standard mode doesn't recognize typeof() anymore. This can
be tested by compiling test_cpp test with -std=c++17 or -std=c++1z options.
The use of typeof in skeleton generated code is unnecessary, all types are
well-known at the time of code generation, so remove all typeof()'s to make
skeleton code more future-proof when interacting with C++ compilers.
