RDMA/mlx5: Refactor mlx5_ib_alloc_ucontext() response

Refactor mlx5_ib_alloc_ucontext() to set its response fields in a
cleaner way.

It includes,
- Move the relevant code to a self contained function.
- Calculate the response length once and drop redundant code all around.
- Reuse previously set ucontext fields once preparing the response.

The self contained function will be used in next patch as part of
implementing the query ucontext functionality.
