mtd: rawnand: toshiba: Choose the interface configuration for TH58NVG2S3HBAI4

The Kioxia/Toshiba TH58NVG2S3HBAI4 NAND memory is not ONFI compliant.
The timings of the NAND chip memory are quite close to ONFI mode 4 but
is breaking that spec.

By providing our own set of timings, erase block read speed is increased
from 6910 kiB/s to 13490 kiB/s and erase block write speed is increased
from 3350 kiB/s to 4410 kiB/s.

Tested on IMX6SX which has a NAND controller supporting EDO mode.
