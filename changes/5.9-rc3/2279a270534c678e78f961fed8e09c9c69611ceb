btrfs: make get_state_failrec return failrec directly

Only failure that get_state_failrec can get is if there is no failure
for the given address. There is no reason why the function should return
a status code and use a separate parameter for returning the actual
failure rec (if one is found). Simplify it by making the return type
a pointer and return ERR_PTR value in case of errors.
