sch_cake: add RFC 8622 LE PHB support to CAKE diffserv handling

Change tin mapping on diffserv3, 4 & 8 for LE PHB support, in essence
making LE a member of the Bulk tin.

Bulk has the least priority and minimum of 1/16th total bandwidth in the
face of higher priority traffic.

NB: Diffserv 3 & 4 swap tin 0 & 1 priorities from the default order as
found in diffserv8, in case anyone is wondering why it looks a bit odd.
