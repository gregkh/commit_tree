irqchip/ti-sci-inta: Do not store TISCI device id in platform device id field

Even though DT doesn't make active use of id field in platform_device, we cannot
hijack it to store TISCI device id. So create a field in struct ti_sci_inta
for storing TISCI id and drop usage of id field in platform_device.
