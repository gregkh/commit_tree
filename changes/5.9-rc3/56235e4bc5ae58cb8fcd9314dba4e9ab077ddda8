ASoC: q6afe-dai: mark all widgets registers as SND_SOC_NOPM

Looks like the q6afe-dai dapm widget registers are set as "0",
which is a not correct.

As this registers will be read by ASoC core during startup
which will throw up errors, Fix this by making the registers
as SND_SOC_NOPM as these should be never used.

With recent changes to ASoC core, every register read/write
failures are reported very verbosely. Prior to this fails to reads
are totally ignored, so we never saw any error messages.
