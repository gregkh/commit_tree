powerpc/pmem: Add new instructions for persistent storage and sync

POWER10 introduces two new variants of dcbf instructions (dcbstps and dcbfps)
that can be used to write modified locations back to persistent storage.

Additionally, POWER10 also introduce phwsync and plwsync which can be used
to establish order of these writes to persistent storage.

This patch exposes these instructions to the rest of the kernel. The existing
dcbf and hwsync instructions in P8 and P9 are adequate to enable appropriate
synchronization with OpenCAPI-hosted persistent storage. Hence the new
instructions are added as a variant of the old ones that old hardware
won't differentiate.
