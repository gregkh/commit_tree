dmaengine: idxd: add work queue drain support

Add wq drain support. When a wq is being released, it needs to wait for
all in-flight operation to complete.  A device control function
idxd_wq_drain() has been added to facilitate this. A wq drain call
is added to the char dev on release to make sure all user operations are
complete. A wq drain is also added before the wq is being disabled.

A drain command can take an unpredictable period of time. Interrupt support
for device commands is added to allow waiting on the command to
finish. If a previous command is in progress, the new submitter can block
until the current command is finished before proceeding. The interrupt
based submission will submit the command and then wait until a command
completion interrupt happens to complete. All commands are moved to the
interrupt based command submission except for the device reset during
probe, which will be polled.
