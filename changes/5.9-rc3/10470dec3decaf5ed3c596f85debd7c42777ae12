cpufreq: dt: fix oops on armada37xx

Commit 0c868627e617e43a295d8 (cpufreq: dt: Allow platform specific
intermediate callbacks) added two function pointers to the
struct cpufreq_dt_platform_data. However, armada37xx_cpufreq_driver_init()
has this struct (pdata) located on the stack and uses only "suspend"
and "resume" fields. So these newly added "get_intermediate" and
"target_intermediate" pointers are uninitialized and contain arbitrary
non-null values, causing all kinds of trouble.

For instance, here is an oops on espressobin after an attempt to change
the cpefreq governor:

[   29.174554] Unable to handle kernel execute from non-executable memory at virtual address ffff00003f87bdc0
...
[   29.269373] pc : 0xffff00003f87bdc0
[   29.272957] lr : __cpufreq_driver_target+0x138/0x580
...

Fixed by zeroing out pdata before use.
