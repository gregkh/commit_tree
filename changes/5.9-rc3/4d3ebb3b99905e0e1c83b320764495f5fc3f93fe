remoteproc: Refactor function rproc_free_vring()

When function rproc_free_vring() clears the virtio device section
it does so on the cached resource table rather than the one
installed in the remote processor memory.  When a remote processor
has been booted by another entity there is no need to use a cached
table and as such, no need to clear the virtio device section in
it.
