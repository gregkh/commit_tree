selftests/bpf: Fix spurious test failures in core_retro selftest

core_retro selftest uses BPF program that's triggered on sys_enter
system-wide, but has no protection from some unrelated process doing syscall
while selftest is running. This leads to occasional test failures with
unexpected PIDs being returned. Fix that by filtering out all processes that
are not test_progs process.
