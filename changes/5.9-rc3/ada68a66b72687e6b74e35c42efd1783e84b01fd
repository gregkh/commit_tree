powerpc/64s: Move HMI IRQ stat from percpu variable to paca.

With the proposed change in percpu bootmem allocator to use page
mapping [1], the percpu first chunk memory area can come from vmalloc
ranges. This makes the HMI (Hypervisor Maintenance Interrupt) handler
crash the kernel whenever percpu variable is accessed in real mode.
This patch fixes this issue by moving the HMI IRQ stat inside paca for
safe access in realmode.
