arm64: defconfig: enable TSN features for ENETC and similiar hardware

Newer network cards and switches support offloading of certain packet
scheduling, classifying and actions onto the hardware itself. For
example, time-aware and credit based schedulers. To use this feature we
have to enable the corresponding modules. Please note, that this will
also enable NET_SCHED and NET_CLS_ACT as builtin because there is no
module option. The enabled modules should get us a good foundation.
