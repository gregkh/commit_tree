drm/vc4: crtc: Only access the PixelValve registers if we have to

The CRTC hooks are called both for the TXP and the pixelvalve, yet some
will read / write the registers as if the device was a pixelvalve, which
won't really work.

Let's make sure we only access those registers if we are running on a
PixelValve.
