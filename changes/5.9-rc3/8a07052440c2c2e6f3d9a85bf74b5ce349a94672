drm/panel: simple: Add support for KOE TX26D202VM0BWA panel

This patch adds support for Kaohsiung Opto-Electronics Inc.
10.1" TX26D202VM0BWA WUXGA(1920x1200) TFT LCD panel with LVDS interface.
The panel has dual LVDS channels.

My panel is manufactured by US Micro Products(USMP).  There is a tag at
the back of the panel, which indicates the panel type is 'TX26D202VM0BWA'
and it's made by KOE in Taiwan.

The panel spec from USMP can be found at:
https://www.usmicroproducts.com/sites/default/files/datasheets/USMP-T101-192120NDU-A0.pdf

The below panel spec from KOE is basically the same to the one from USMP.
However, the panel type 'TX26D202VM0BAA' is a little bit different.
It looks that the two types of panel are compatible with each other.
