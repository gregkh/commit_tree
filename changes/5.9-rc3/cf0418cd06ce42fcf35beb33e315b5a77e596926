ASoC: Intel: sof_sdw_rt711: remove properties in card remove

The rt711 jack detection properties are set from the machine drivers
during the card probe, as done in other ASoC examples.

KASAN reports a use-after-free error when unbinding drivers due to a
confusing sequence between the ACPI core, the device core and the
SoundWire device cleanups.

Rather than fixing this sequence, follow the recommendation to have
the same caller add and remove properties, add an explicit
device_remove_properties() in the card .remove() callback.

In future patches the use of device_add/remove_properties will be
replaced by a direct handling of a swnode, but the sequence will
remain the same.
