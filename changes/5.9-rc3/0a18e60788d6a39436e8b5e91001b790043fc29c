mm: remove vm_total_pages

The global variable "vm_total_pages" is a relic from older days.  There is
only a single user that reads the variable - build_all_zonelists() - and
the first thing it does is update it.

Use a local variable in build_all_zonelists() instead and remove the
global variable.
