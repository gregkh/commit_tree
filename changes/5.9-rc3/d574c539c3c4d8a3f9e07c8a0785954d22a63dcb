KVM: x86: move MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES emulation to common x86 code

state_test/smm_test selftests are failing on AMD with:
"Unexpected result from KVM_GET_MSRS, r: 51 (failed MSR was 0x345)"

MSR_IA32_PERF_CAPABILITIES is an emulated MSR on Intel but it is not
known to AMD code, we can move the emulation to common x86 code. For
AMD, we basically just allow the host to read and write zero to the MSR.

Fixes: 27461da31089 ("KVM: x86/pmu: Support full width counting")
