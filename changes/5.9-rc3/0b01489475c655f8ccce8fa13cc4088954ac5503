clk: qcom: clk-alpha-pll: same regs and ops for trion and lucid

Fixed ops were already identical, this adds support for non-fixed ops by
sharing between trion and lucid.

This also changes the names for trion ops to be consistent with the rest.

Note LUCID_PCAL_DONE is renamed to TRION_PCAL_DONE because it is wrong for
lucid, LUCID_PCAL_DONE should be BIT(27). Next patch will address this.
