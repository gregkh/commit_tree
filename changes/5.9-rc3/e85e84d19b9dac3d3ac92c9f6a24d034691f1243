dt-bindings: arm-smmu: add compatible string for Marvell Armada-AP806 SMMU-500

Add specific compatible string for Marvell usage due to errata of
accessing 64bits registers of ARM SMMU, in AP806.

AP806 SoC uses the generic ARM-MMU500, and there's no specific
implementation of Marvell, this compatible is used for errata only.
