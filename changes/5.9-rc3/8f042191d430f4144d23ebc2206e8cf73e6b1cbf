nvmem: qcom-spmi-sdam: Enable multiple devices

Using pdev->id as the nvmem's config ID (which, by default, is
NVMEM_DEVID_NONE) prevents multiple instances of this driver from
probing because of the following error:

  sysfs: cannot create duplicate filename '/bus/nvmem/devices/spmi_sdam'

Use NVMEM_DEVID_AUTO as the NVMEM config ID to fix the issue.
