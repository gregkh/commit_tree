net: dccp: Add SIOCOUTQ IOCTL support (send buffer fill)

This adds support for the SIOCOUTQ IOCTL to get the send buffer fill
of a DCCP socket, like UDP and TCP sockets already have.

Regarding the used data field: DCCP uses per packet sequence numbers,
not per byte, so sequence numbers can't be used like in TCP. sk_wmem_queued
is not used by DCCP and always 0, even in test on highly congested paths.
Therefore this uses sk_wmem_alloc like in UDP.
