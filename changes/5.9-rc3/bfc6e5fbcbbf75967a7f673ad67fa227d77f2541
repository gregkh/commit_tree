bnxt_en: Update firmware interface to 1.10.1.54.

Main changes are 200G support and fixing the definitions of discard and
error counters to match the hardware definitions.

Because the HWRM_PORT_PHY_QCFG message size has now exceeded the max.
encapsulated response message size of 96 bytes from the PF to the VF,
we now need to cap this message to 96 bytes for forwarding.  The forwarded
response only needs to contain the basic link status and speed information
and can be capped without adding the new information.

v2: Fix bnxt_re compile error.
