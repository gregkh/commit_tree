arm64: tegra: Remove parent clock from display controllers

The display controller's parent clock depends on the output that's
consuming data from the display controller, so it needs to be specified
as the parent of the corresponding output. The device tree bindings do
specify this, so just correct the existing device trees that get this
wrong.
