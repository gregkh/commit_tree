mptcp: token: move retry to caller

Once syncookie support is added, no state will be stored anymore when the
syn/ack is generated in syncookie mode.

When the ACK comes back, the generated key will be taken from the TCP ACK,
the token is re-generated and inserted into the token tree.

This means we can't retry with a new key when the token is already taken
in the syncookie case.

Therefore, move the retry logic to the caller to prepare for syncookie
support in mptcp.
