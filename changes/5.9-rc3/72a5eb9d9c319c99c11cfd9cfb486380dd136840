firmware: arm_scmi: Remove fixed size fields from reports/scmi_event_header

Event reports are used to convey information describing events to the
registered user-callbacks: they are necessarily derived from the underlying
raw SCMI events' messages but they are not meant to expose or directly
mirror any of those messages data layout, which belong to the protocol
layer.

Using fixed size types for report fields, mirroring messages structure,
is at odd with this: get rid of them using more generic, equivalent,
typing.

Substitute scmi_event_header fixed size fields with generic types too and
shuffle around fields definitions to minimize implicit padding while
adapting involved functions.
