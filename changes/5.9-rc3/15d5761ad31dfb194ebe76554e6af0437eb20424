kbuild: introduce ccflags-remove-y and asflags-remove-y

CFLAGS_REMOVE_<file>.o filters out flags when compiling a particular
object, but there is no convenient way to do that for every object in
a directory.

Add ccflags-remove-y and asflags-remove-y to make it easily.

Use ccflags-remove-y to clean up some Makefiles.

The add/remove order works as follows:

 [1] KBUILD_CFLAGS specifies compiler flags used globally

 [2] ccflags-y adds compiler flags for all objects in the
     current Makefile

 [3] ccflags-remove-y removes compiler flags for all objects in the
     current Makefile (New feature)

 [4] CFLAGS_<file> adds compiler flags per file.

 [5] CFLAGS_REMOVE_<file> removes compiler flags per file.

Having [3] before [4] allows us to remove flags from most (but not all)
objects in the current Makefile.

For example, kernel/trace/Makefile removes $(CC_FLAGS_FTRACE)
from all objects in the directory, then adds it back to
trace_selftest_dynamic.o and CFLAGS_trace_kprobe_selftest.o

The same applies to lib/livepatch/Makefile.

Please note ccflags-remove-y has no effect to the sub-directories.
In contrast, the previous notation got rid of compiler flags also from
all the sub-directories.

The following are not affected because they have no sub-directories:

  arch/arm/boot/compressed/
  arch/powerpc/xmon/
  arch/sh/
  kernel/trace/

However, lib/ has several sub-directories.

To keep the behavior, I added ccflags-remove-y to all Makefiles
in subdirectories of lib/, except the following:

  lib/vdso/Makefile        - Kbuild does not descend into this Makefile
  lib/raid/test/Makefile   - This is not used for the kernel build

I think commit 2464a609ded0 ("ftrace: do not trace library functions")
excluded too much. In the next commit, I will remove ccflags-remove-y
from the sub-directories of lib/.
