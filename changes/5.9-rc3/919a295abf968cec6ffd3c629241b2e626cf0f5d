scsi: iscsi: Register sysfs for workqueue iscsi_destroy

Register sysfs for workqueue iscsi_destroy so that users can set CPU
affinity through "cpumask" for this workqueue to get better isolation in
cloud multi-tenant scenario.

This patch unfolded create_singlethread_workqueue(), added WQ_SYSFS and
drop __WQ_ORDERED_EXPLICIT since __WQ_ORDERED_EXPLICIT workqueue isn't
allowed to change "cpumask".
