scsi: zfcp: Fix use-after-free in request timeout handlers

Before v4.15 commit 75492a51568b ("s390/scsi: Convert timers to use
timer_setup()"), we intentionally only passed zfcp_adapter as context
argument to zfcp_fsf_request_timeout_handler(). Since we only trigger
adapter recovery, it was unnecessary to sync against races between timeout
and (late) completion.  Likewise, we only passed zfcp_erp_action as context
argument to zfcp_erp_timeout_handler(). Since we only wakeup an ERP action,
it was unnecessary to sync against races between timeout and (late)
completion.

Meanwhile the timeout handlers get timer_list as context argument and do a
timer-specific container-of to zfcp_fsf_req which can have been freed.

Fix it by making sure that any request timeout handlers, that might just
have started before del_timer(), are completed by using del_timer_sync()
instead. This ensures the request free happens afterwards.

Space time diagram of potential use-after-free:

Basic idea is to have 2 or more pending requests whose timeouts run out at
almost the same time.

req 1 timeout     ERP thread        req 2 timeout
----------------  ----------------  ---------------------------------------
zfcp_fsf_request_timeout_handler
fsf_req = from_timer(fsf_req, t, timer)
adapter = fsf_req->adapter
zfcp_qdio_siosl(adapter)
zfcp_erp_adapter_reopen(adapter,...)
                  zfcp_erp_strategy
                  ...
                  zfcp_fsf_req_dismiss_all
                  list_for_each_entry_safe
                    zfcp_fsf_req_complete 1
                    del_timer 1
                    zfcp_fsf_req_free 1
                    zfcp_fsf_req_complete 2
                                    zfcp_fsf_request_timeout_handler
                    del_timer 2
                                    fsf_req = from_timer(fsf_req, t, timer)
                    zfcp_fsf_req_free 2
                                    adapter = fsf_req->adapter
                                              ^^^^^^^ already freed
