drm/i915: WARN if max vswing/pre-emphasis violates the DP spec

According to the DP spec a DPTX must support vswing/pre-emphasis
up to and including level 2. Level 3 is optional (actually DP 1.4a
seems to make even level 3 mandatory for HBR2/3, while leaving it
optional for RBR/HBR1).

WARN if out encoders' .voltage_max()/.preemph_max() return
an illegal value.
