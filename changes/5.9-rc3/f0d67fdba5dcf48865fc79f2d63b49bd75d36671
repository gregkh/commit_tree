ASoC: qcom: common: Parse properties with "qcom," prefix

The apq8016_sbc device tree binding uses a "qcom," vendor prefix
for all device tree properties, while qcom_snd_parse_of() uses the
same properties without a prefix.

In the future it would be nice to make this consistent, however,
for backwards compatibility we need to parse both names to allow
apq8016_sbc to use the common qcom_snd_parse_of() function.
