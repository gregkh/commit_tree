ide: Remove uninitialized_var() usage

Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
(or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings (e.g.
"unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized, either
simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes. As a precursor
to removing[2] this[3] macro[4], just remove this variable since it was
actually unused:

drivers/ide/ide-taskfile.c:232:34: warning: unused variable 'flags' [-Wunused-variable]
        unsigned long uninitialized_var(flags);
                                        ^
