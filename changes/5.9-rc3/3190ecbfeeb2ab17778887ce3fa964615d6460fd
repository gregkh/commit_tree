powerpc/watchpoint: Fix 512 byte boundary limit

Milton Miller reported that we are aligning start and end address to
wrong size SZ_512M. It should be SZ_512. Fix that.

While doing this change I also found a case where ALIGN() comparison
fails. Within a given aligned range, ALIGN() of two addresses does not
match when start address is pointing to the first byte and end address
is pointing to any other byte except the first one. But that's not true
for ALIGN_DOWN(). ALIGN_DOWN() of any two addresses within that range
will always point to the first byte. So use ALIGN_DOWN() instead of
ALIGN().
