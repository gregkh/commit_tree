block: fix get_max_io_size()

A previous commit aligning splits to physical block sizes inadvertently
modified one return case such that that it now returns 0 length splits
when the number of sectors doesn't exceed the physical offset. This
later hits a BUG in bio_split(). Restore the previous working behavior.
