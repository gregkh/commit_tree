dt-bindings: arm: bcm: Add a select to the RPI Firmware binding

The RaspberryPi firmware binding uses two compatible, include simple-bus.
The select statement generated by default will thus select any node that
has simple-bus, not all of them being the raspberrypi firmware node.

This results in warnings being wrongfully reported. Let's add a custom
select statement to fix that.
