drm/amd/display: Compare v_front_porch when checking if streams are synchronizable

[Why]
If the front porch of the two timings differ, then there may not be
enough time while both streams are in vertical blank to perform a memory
clock change. This can hang the system.

[How]
Check the each streams timing.v_front_porch when determining if the two
streams are synchronizable.
