x86/entry: Rename idtentry_enter/exit_cond_rcu() to idtentry_enter/exit()

They were originally called _cond_rcu because they were special versions
with conditional RCU handling.  Now they're the standard entry and exit
path, so the _cond_rcu part is just confusing.  Drop it.

Also change the signature to make them more extensible and more foolproof.

No functional change -- it's pure refactoring.
