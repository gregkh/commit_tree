drivers/base/memory: rename base_memory_block_id to memory_block_id

memory_block may have a larger granularity than section, this is why we
have base_section_nr. But base_memory_block_id seems a little
misleading, since there is no larger granularity concept which groups
several memory_block.

What we need here is the exact memory_block_id to a section_nr. Let's
rename it to make it more precise.
