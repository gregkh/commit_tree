tcp: rename request_sock cookie_ts bit to syncookie

Nowadays output function has a 'synack_type' argument that tells us when
the syn/ack is emitted via syncookies.

The request already tells us when timestamps are supported, so check
both to detect special timestamp for tcp option encoding is needed.

We could remove cookie_ts altogether, but a followup patch would
otherwise need to adjust function signatures to pass 'want_cookie' to
mptcp core.

This way, the 'existing' bit can be used.
