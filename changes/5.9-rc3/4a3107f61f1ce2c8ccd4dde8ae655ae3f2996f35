tty: serial: qcom-geni-serial: Drop the icc bw votes in suspend for console

When using the geni-serial as console, its important to be
able to hit the lowest possible power state in suspend,
even with no_console_suspend.
The only thing that prevents it today on platforms like the sc7180
is the interconnect BW votes, which we certainly don't need when
the system is in suspend. So in the suspend handler mark them as
ACTIVE_ONLY (0x3) and on resume switch them back to the ALWAYS tag (0x7)
