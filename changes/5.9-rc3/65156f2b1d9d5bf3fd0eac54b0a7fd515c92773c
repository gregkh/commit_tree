powerpc/perf: Initialize power10 PMU registers in cpu setup routine

Initialize Monitor Mode Control Register 3 (MMCR3)
SPR which is new in power10. For PowerISA v3.1, BHRB disable
is controlled via Monitor Mode Control Register A (MMCRA) bit,
namely "BHRB Recording Disable (BHRBRD)". This patch also initializes
MMCRA BHRBRD to disable BHRB feature at boot for power10.
