selftests/powerpc: Fix pkey syscall redefinitions

On distros using older glibc versions, the pkey tests encounter build
failures due to redefinition of the pkey syscall numbers.

For compatibility, commit 743f3544fffb added a wrapper for the
gettid() syscall and included syscall.h if the version of glibc used
is older than 2.30. This leads to different definitions of SYS_pkey_*
as the ones in the pkey test header set numeric constants where as the
ones from syscall.h reuse __NR_pkey_*. The compiler complains about
redefinitions since they are different.

This replaces SYS_pkey_* definitions with __NR_pkey_* such that the
definitions in both syscall.h and pkeys.h are alike. This way, if
syscall.h has to be included for compatibility reasons, builds will
still succeed.
