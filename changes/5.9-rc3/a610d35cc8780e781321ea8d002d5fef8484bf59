powerpc/powernv/sriov: Factor out M64 BAR setup

The sequence required to use the single PE BAR mode is kinda janky and
requires a little explanation. The API was designed with P7-IOC style
windows where the setup process is something like:

1. Configure the window start / end address
2. Enable the window
3. Map the segments of each window to the PE

For Single PE BARs the process is:

1. Set the PE for segment zero on a disabled window
2. Set the range
3. Enable the window

Move the OPAL calls into their own helper functions where the quirks can be
contained.
