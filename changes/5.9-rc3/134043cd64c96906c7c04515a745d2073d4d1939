ACPI: PAD: Eliminate usage of uninitialized_var() macro

This is an effort to eliminate the uninitialized_var() macro[1].

The use of this macro is the wrong solution because it forces off ANY
analysis by the compiler for a given variable. It even masks "unused
variable" warnings.

Quoted from Linus[2]:

"It's a horrible thing to use, in that it adds extra cruft to the
source code, and then shuts up a compiler warning (even the _reliable_
warnings from gcc)."

The gcc option "-Wmaybe-uninitialized" has been disabled and this change
will not produce any warnnings even with "make W=1".
