powerpc/powernv/sriov: Explain how SR-IOV works on PowerNV

SR-IOV support on PowerNV is a byzantine maze of hooks. I have no idea
how anyone is supposed to know how it works except through a lot of
stuffering. Write up some docs about the overall story to help out
the next sucker^Wperson who needs to tinker with it.
