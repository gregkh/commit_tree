tulip: uli526x: use generic power management

With the support of generic PM callbacks, drivers no longer need to use
legacy .suspend() and .resume() in which they had to maintain PCI states
changes and device's power state themselves.

Legacy PM involves usage of PCI helper functions like pci_enable_wake()
which is no longer recommended.

Compile-tested only.
