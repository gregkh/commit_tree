kvm: x86: Toggling CR4.PKE does not load PDPTEs in PAE mode

See the SDM, volume 3, section 4.4.1:

If PAE paging would be in use following an execution of MOV to CR0 or
MOV to CR4 (see Section 4.1.1) and the instruction is modifying any of
CR0.CD, CR0.NW, CR0.PG, CR4.PAE, CR4.PGE, CR4.PSE, or CR4.SMEP; then
the PDPTEs are loaded from the address in CR3.
