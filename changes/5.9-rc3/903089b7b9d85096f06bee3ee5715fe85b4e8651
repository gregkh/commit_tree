xhci: dbc: Change to pass dbc pointer to xhci_do_dbc_stop()

Pass the dbc pointer instead of xhci_hcd pointer in order to
decouple xhci and dbc.

xhci_do_dbc_stop() only used xhci to get the dbc pointer.
Pass the dbc pointer instead as a parameter

No functional changes
This change helps decoupling xhci and DbC
