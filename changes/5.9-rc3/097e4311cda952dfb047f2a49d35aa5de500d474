perf/x86: Add constraint to create guest LBR event without hw counter

The hypervisor may request the perf subsystem to schedule a time window
to directly access the LBR records msrs for its own use. Normally, it would
create a guest LBR event with callstack mode enabled, which is scheduled
along with other ordinary LBR events on the host but in an exclusive way.

To avoid wasting a counter for the guest LBR event, the perf tracks its
hw->idx via INTEL_PMC_IDX_FIXED_VLBR and assigns it with a fake VLBR
counter with the help of new vlbr_constraint. As with the BTS event,
there is actually no hardware counter assigned for the guest LBR event.
