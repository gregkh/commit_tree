fbcon: prevent user font height or width change from causing potential out-of-bounds access

Add a check to fbcon_resize() to ensure that a possible change to user font
height or user font width will not allow a font data out-of-bounds access.
NOTE: must use original charcount in calculation as font charcount can
change and cannot be used to determine the font data allocated size.
