RDMA/mlx5: Allow SQ modification

Currently the SQ is set to a ready state when the RAW QP is modified to
INIT.  When the TIS is modified, e.g. to change the lag_tx_affinity, then
SQs which are already in the ready state will not be affected.

Open a window to modify the SQ behavior by setting the SQ as ready only
when QP was modified to RTS.
