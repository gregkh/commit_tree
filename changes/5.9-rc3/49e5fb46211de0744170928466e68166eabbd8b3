btrfs: qgroup: export qgroups in sysfs

This patch will add the following sysfs interface:

  /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/qgroups/<qgroup_id>/referenced
  /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/qgroups/<qgroup_id>/exclusive
  /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/qgroups/<qgroup_id>/max_referenced
  /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/qgroups/<qgroup_id>/max_exclusive
  /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/qgroups/<qgroup_id>/limit_flags

Which is also available in output of "btrfs qgroup show".

  /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/qgroups/<qgroup_id>/rsv_data
  /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/qgroups/<qgroup_id>/rsv_meta_pertrans
  /sys/fs/btrfs/<UUID>/qgroups/<qgroup_id>/rsv_meta_prealloc

The last 3 rsv related members are not visible to users, but can be very
useful to debug qgroup limit related bugs.

Also, to avoid '/' used in <qgroup_id>, the separator between qgroup
level and qgroup id is changed to '_'.

The interface is not hidden behind 'debug' as we want this interface to
be included into production build and to provide another way to read the
qgroup information besides the ioctls.
