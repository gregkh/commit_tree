btrfs: use helper btrfs_get_block_group

Use the helper function where it is open coded to increment the
block_group reference count As btrfs_get_block_group() is a one-liner we
could have open-coded it, but its partner function
btrfs_put_block_group() isn't one-liner which does the free part in it.
