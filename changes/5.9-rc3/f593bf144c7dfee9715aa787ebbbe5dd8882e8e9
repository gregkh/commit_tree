xfs: mark inode buffers in cache

Inode buffers always have write IO callbacks, so by marking them
directly we can avoid needing to attach ->b_iodone functions to
them. This avoids an indirect call, and makes future modifications
much simpler.

While this is largely a refactor of existing functionality, we
broaden the scope of the flag to beyond where inodes are explicitly
attached because future changes need to know what type of log items
are attached to the buffer. Adding this buffer flag may invoke the
inode iodone callback in cases where it wouldn't have been
previously, but this is not a functional change because the callback
is identical to the normal buffer write iodone callback when inodes
are not attached.
