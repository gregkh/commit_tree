iomap: Make sure iomap_end is called after iomap_begin

Make sure iomap_end is always called when iomap_begin succeeds.

Without this fix, iomap_end won't be called when a filesystem's
iomap_begin operation returns an invalid mapping, bypassing any
unlocking done in iomap_end.  With this fix, the unlocking will still
happen.

This bug was found by Bob Peterson during code review.  It's unlikely
that such iomap_begin bugs will survive to affect users, so backporting
this fix seems unnecessary.
