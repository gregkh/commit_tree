powerpc/watchpoint: Enable watchpoint functionality on power10 guest

CPU_FTR_DAWR is by default enabled for host via CPU_FTRS_DT_CPU_BASE
(controlled by CONFIG_PPC_DT_CPU_FTRS). But cpu-features device-tree
node is not PAPR compatible and thus not yet used by kvm or pHyp
guests. Enable watchpoint functionality on power10 guest (both kvm
and powervm) by adding CPU_FTR_DAWR to CPU_FTRS_POWER10. Note that
this change does not enable 2nd DAWR support.
