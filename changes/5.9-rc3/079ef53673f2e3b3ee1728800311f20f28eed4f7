bpf: Fix build for disabled CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF option

Stephen reported following linker warnings on powerpc build:

  ld: warning: orphan section `.BTF_ids' from `kernel/trace/bpf_trace.o' being placed in section `.BTF_ids'
  ld: warning: orphan section `.BTF_ids' from `kernel/bpf/btf.o' being placed in section `.BTF_ids'
  ld: warning: orphan section `.BTF_ids' from `kernel/bpf/stackmap.o' being placed in section `.BTF_ids'
  ld: warning: orphan section `.BTF_ids' from `net/core/filter.o' being placed in section `.BTF_ids'
  ld: warning: orphan section `.BTF_ids' from `kernel/trace/bpf_trace.o' being placed in section `.BTF_ids'

It's because we generated .BTF_ids section even when
CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF is not enabled. Fixing this by
generating empty btf_id arrays for this case.
