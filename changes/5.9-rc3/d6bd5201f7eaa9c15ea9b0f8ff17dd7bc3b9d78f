mailmap: Restore dictionary sorting

Several names had been recently appended (instead of inserted). While
git-shortlog doesn't need this file to be sorted, it helps humans to
keep it organized this way. Sort the entire file (which includes some
minor shuffling for dictionary order).

Done with the following commands:

	grep -E '^(#|$)' .mailmap > .mailmap.head
	grep -Ev '^(#|$)' .mailmap > .mailmap.body
 	sort -f .mailmap.body > .mailmap.body.sort
	cat .mailmap.head .mailmap.body.sort > .mailmap
	rm .mailmap.head .mailmap.body.sort
