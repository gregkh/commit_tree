s390/qdio: fix statistics for 128 SBALs

Old code would only scan up to 127 SBALs at once. So the last statistics
bucket was set aside to count "discovered 127 SBALs with new work"
events.

But nowadays we allow to scan all 128 SBALs for Output Queues, and a
subsequent patch will introduce the same for Input Queues.
So fix up the accounting to use the last bucket only when all 128 SBALs
have been discovered with new work.
