Documentation/litmus-tests/atomic: Add a test for smp_mb__after_atomic()

We already use a litmus test in atomic_t.txt to describe atomic RMW +
smp_mb__after_atomic() is stronger than acquire (both the read and the
write parts are ordered). So make it a litmus test in atomic-tests
directory, so that people can access the litmus easily.

Additionally, change the processor numbers "P1, P2" to "P0, P1" in
atomic_t.txt for the consistency with the processor numbers in the
litmus test, which herd can handle.
