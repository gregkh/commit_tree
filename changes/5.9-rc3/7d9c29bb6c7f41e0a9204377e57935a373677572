MAINTAINERS: use my kernel.org address

There were enough problems with suse.{com,cz} MTAs recently. I am bored
by restoring lost e-mails from public archives. Let's switch (all) my
MAINTAINERS addresses to @kernel.org and forward the e-mails there as I
wish.

And add the whole history to .mailmap.
