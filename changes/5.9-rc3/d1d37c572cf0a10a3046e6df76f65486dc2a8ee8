ALSA: hda/sigmatel: Use the new vmaster mute LED helper

Convert the mute LED handling in Sigmatel/IDT codec to the new vmaster
mute helper.  A point to be cautiously handled is that the value
passed to the callback is inverted; the vmaster passes "enabled"
(0 = mute), while LED classdev passes "brightness" (1 = mute).

A positive side-effect by this change is that the driver gets also the
enum controls for the mute behavior like other drivers already had.
