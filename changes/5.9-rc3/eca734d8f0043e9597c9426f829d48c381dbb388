vt_ioctl: eliminate use of uival and ucval

They were used for the first parameter of put_user. But put_user accepts
constants in the parameter and also determines the type only by the
second parameter. So we can safely drop these helpers and simplify the
code a bit.

Including the removal of set_int label.
