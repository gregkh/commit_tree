Drivers: hv: vmbus: Only notify Hyper-V for die events that are oops

Hyper-V currently may be notified of a panic for any die event. But
this results in false panic notifications for various user space traps
that are die events. Fix this by ignoring die events that aren't oops.

Fixes: 510f7aef65bb ("Drivers: hv: vmbus: prefer 'die' notification chain to 'panic'")
