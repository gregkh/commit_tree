dt-bindings: phy: zynqmp-psgtr: Fix example's numbers of cells in reg

The DT examples are by default compiled in a parent that has
 #address-cells and #size-cells both set to 1. Fix the example
accordingly, even if it doesn't match the actual hardware, as this is
the recommended practice for DT bindings examples.
