libbpf: Make BTF finalization strict

With valid ELF and valid BTF, there is no reason (apart from bugs) why BTF
finalization should fail. So make it strict and return error if it fails. This
makes CO-RE relocation more reliable, as they are not going to be just
silently skipped, if BTF finalization failed.
