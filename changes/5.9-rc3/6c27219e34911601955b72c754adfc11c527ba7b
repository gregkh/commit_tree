mfd: Add support for the Khadas System control Microcontroller

This Microcontroller is present on the Khadas VIM1, VIM2, VIM3 and Edge
boards.

It has multiple boot control features like password check, power-on
options, power-off control and system FAN control on recent boards.

This implements a very basic MFD driver with the fan control and User
NVMEM cells.
