bareudp: Reverted support to enable & disable rx metadata collection

The commit fe80536acf83 ("bareudp: Added attribute to enable & disable
rx metadata collection") breaks the the original(5.7) default behavior of
bareudp module to collect RX metadadata at the receive. It was added to
avoid the crash at the kernel neighbour subsytem when packet with metadata
from bareudp is processed. But it is no more needed as the
commit 394de110a733 ("net: Added pointer check for
dst->ops->neigh_lookup in dst_neigh_lookup_skb") solves this crash.
