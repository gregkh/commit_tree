bpf: Introduce SK_LOOKUP program type with a dedicated attach point

Add a new program type BPF_PROG_TYPE_SK_LOOKUP with a dedicated attach type
BPF_SK_LOOKUP. The new program kind is to be invoked by the transport layer
when looking up a listening socket for a new connection request for
connection oriented protocols, or when looking up an unconnected socket for
a packet for connection-less protocols.

When called, SK_LOOKUP BPF program can select a socket that will receive
the packet. This serves as a mechanism to overcome the limits of what
bind() API allows to express. Two use-cases driving this work are:

 (1) steer packets destined to an IP range, on fixed port to a socket

     192.0.2.0/24, port 80 -> NGINX socket

 (2) steer packets destined to an IP address, on any port to a socket

     198.51.100.1, any port -> L7 proxy socket

In its run-time context program receives information about the packet that
triggered the socket lookup. Namely IP version, L4 protocol identifier, and
address 4-tuple. Context can be further extended to include ingress
interface identifier.

To select a socket BPF program fetches it from a map holding socket
references, like SOCKMAP or SOCKHASH, and calls bpf_sk_assign(ctx, sk, ...)
helper to record the selection. Transport layer then uses the selected
socket as a result of socket lookup.

In its basic form, SK_LOOKUP acts as a filter and hence must return either
SK_PASS or SK_DROP. If the program returns with SK_PASS, transport should
look for a socket to receive the packet, or use the one selected by the
program if available, while SK_DROP informs the transport layer that the
lookup should fail.

This patch only enables the user to attach an SK_LOOKUP program to a
network namespace. Subsequent patches hook it up to run on local delivery
path in ipv4 and ipv6 stacks.
