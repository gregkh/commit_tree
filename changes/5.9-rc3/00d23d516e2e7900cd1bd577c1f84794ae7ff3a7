io_uring: ensure read requests go through -ERESTART* transformation

We need to call kiocb_done() for any ret < 0 to ensure that we always
get the proper -ERESTARTSYS (and friends) transformation done.

At some point this should be tied into general error handling, so we
can get rid of the various (mostly network) related commands that check
and perform this substitution.
