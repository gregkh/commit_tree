IIO: Ingenic JZ47xx: Add touchscreen mode.

The SADC component in JZ47xx SoCs provides support for touchscreen
operations (pen position and pen down pressure) in single-ended and
differential modes.

The touchscreen component of SADC takes a significant time to stabilize
after first receiving the clock and a delay of 50ms has been empirically
proven to be a safe value before data sampling can begin.

Of the known hardware to use this controller, GCW Zero and Anbernic RG-350
utilize the touchscreen mode by having their joystick(s) attached to the
X/Y positive/negative input pins.

JZ4770 and later SoCs introduce a low-level command feature. With it, up
to 32 commands can be programmed, each one corresponding to a sampling
job. It allows to change the low-voltage reference, the high-voltage
reference, have them connected to VCC, GND, or one of the X-/X+ or Y-/Y+
pins.

This patch introduces support for 6 stream-capable channels:
- channel #0 samples X+/GND
- channel #1 samples Y+/GND
- channel #2 samples X-/GND
- channel #3 samples Y-/GND
- channel #4 samples X+/X-
- channel #5 samples Y+/Y-

Being able to sample X-/GND and Y-/GND is useful on some devices, where
one joystick is connected to the X+/Y+ pins, and a second joystick is
connected to the X-/Y- pins.

All the boards which probe this driver have the interrupt provided from
Device Tree, with no need to handle a case where the IRQ was not provided.
