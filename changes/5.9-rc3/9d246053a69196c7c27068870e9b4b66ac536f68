sched: Add a tracepoint to track rq->nr_running

Add a bare tracepoint trace_sched_update_nr_running_tp which tracks
->nr_running CPU's rq. This is used to accurately trace this data and
provide a visualization of scheduler imbalances in, for example, the
form of a heat map.  The tracepoint is accessed by loading an external
kernel module. An example module (forked from Qais' module and including
the pelt related tracepoints) can be found at:

  https://github.com/auldp/tracepoints-helpers.git

A script to turn the trace-cmd report output into a heatmap plot can be
found at:

  https://github.com/jirvoz/plot-nr-running

The tracepoints are added to add_nr_running() and sub_nr_running() which
are in kernel/sched/sched.h. In order to avoid CREATE_TRACE_POINTS in
the header a wrapper call is used and the trace/events/sched.h include
is moved before sched.h in kernel/sched/core.
