arm64/panic: Unify all three existing notifier blocks

Currently there are three different registered panic notifier blocks. This
unifies all of them into a single one i.e arm64_panic_block, hence reducing
code duplication and required calling sequence during panic. This preserves
the existing dump sequence. While here, just use device_initcall() directly
instead of __initcall() which has been a legacy alias for the earlier. This
replacement is a pure cleanup with no functional implications.
