thunderbolt: Retry USB4 block read operation

Especially when accessing retimers over USB4 sideband operations the
possibility to get read errors seems to be higher so make the
usb4_do_read_data() retry a couple of times if it sees any other error
than -ENODEV (device is gone). We can only do this for read side because
it carries the offset as part of metadata (as opposed to writes).
