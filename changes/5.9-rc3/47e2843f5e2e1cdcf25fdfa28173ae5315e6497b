dts: hi3660: Add support for basic usb gadget on Hikey960

This patch adds basic core dwc3, usb phy and rt1711h nodes for
usb support on Hikey960.

This does not enable the mux/hub functionality on the board, so
the USB-A host ports will not function, but does allow the USB-C
port to function in gadget mode (unfortunately not in host, as
the hub/mux functionality is needed to enable vbus output to
power devices in host mode).

This is based on an old patch originally by Yu Chen.
