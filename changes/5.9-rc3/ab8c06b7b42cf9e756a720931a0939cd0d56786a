mlxsw: spectrum_span: Add support for global mirroring triggers

Global mirroring triggers are triggers that are only keyed by their
trigger, as opposed to per-port triggers, which are keyed by their
trigger and port.

Such triggers allow mirroring packets that were tail/early dropped or
ECN marked to a SPAN agent.

Implement the previously added trigger operations for these global
triggers. Since such triggers are only supported from Spectrum-2
onwards, have the Spectrum-1 operations return an error.
