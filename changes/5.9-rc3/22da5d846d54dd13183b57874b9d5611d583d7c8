drm/i915/display: Only query DP state of a DDI encoder

Avoid a NULL dereference for a mismatched encoder type, hit when
probing state for all encoders.

This is a band aid to prevent the OOPS as the right fix is "probably to
swap the psr vs infoframes.enable checks, or outright disappear from
this function" (Ville).
