drm/amd/display: Improve compatibility by re-ordering info-packets

[why]
On DCN20, Some features would not be activated when ALLM was turned on.
TV seemed to activate only the latest info packet sent, and the ALLM
info packet was sent after the VSIF info packet.

The packet indices was also inconsistent between DCN10 and DCN20.

[how]
Change the packet indices of DCN20 to match those of DCN10.
This makes them consistent and also makes the vendor info packet
be sent after the hfvsif info packet.
