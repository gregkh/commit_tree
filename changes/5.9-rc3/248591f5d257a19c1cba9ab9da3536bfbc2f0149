kcsan: Make KCSAN compatible with new IRQ state tracking

The new IRQ state tracking code does not honor lockdep_off(), and as
such we should again permit tracing by using non-raw functions in
core.c. Update the lockdep_off() comment in report.c, to reflect the
fact there is still a potential risk of deadlock due to using printk()
from scheduler code.
