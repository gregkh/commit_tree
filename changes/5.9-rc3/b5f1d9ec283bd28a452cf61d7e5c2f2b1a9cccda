net: bridge: add a flag to avoid refreshing fdb when changing/adding

When we modify or create a new fdb entry sometimes we want to avoid
refreshing its activity in order to track it properly. One example is
when a mac is received from EVPN multi-homing peer by FRR, which doesn't
want to change local activity accounting. It makes it static and sets a
flag to track its activity.
