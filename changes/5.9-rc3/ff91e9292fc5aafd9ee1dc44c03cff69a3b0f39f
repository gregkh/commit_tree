tcp: call tcp_ack_tstamp() when not fully acked

When skb is coalesced tcp_ack_tstamp() still needs to be called when not
fully acked in tcp_clean_rtx_queue(), otherwise SCM_TSTAMP_ACK
timestamps may never be fired. Since the original patch series had
dependent commits, this patch fixes the issue instead of reverting by
restoring calls to tcp_ack_tstamp() when skb is not fully acked.

Fixes: fdb7eb21ddd3 ("tcp: stamp SCM_TSTAMP_ACK later in tcp_clean_rtx_queue()")
