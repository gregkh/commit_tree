tpm: Add support for event log pointer found in TPM2 ACPI table

In case a TPM2 is attached, search for a TPM2 ACPI table when trying
to get the event log from ACPI. If one is found, use it to get the
start and length of the log area. This allows non-UEFI systems, such
as SeaBIOS, to pass an event log when using a TPM2.
