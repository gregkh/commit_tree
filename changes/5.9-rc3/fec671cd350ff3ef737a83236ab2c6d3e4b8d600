xfs: clean up the buffer iodone callback functions

Now that we've sorted inode and dquot buffers, we can apply the same
cleanups to dirty buffers with buffer log items. They only have one
callback, too, so we don't need the log item callback. Collapse the
iodone functions and remove all the now unnecessary infrastructure
around callback processing.
