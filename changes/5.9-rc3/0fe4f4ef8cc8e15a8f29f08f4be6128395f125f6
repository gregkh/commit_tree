x86: Bump ZO_z_extra_bytes margin for zstd

Bump the ZO_z_extra_bytes margin for zstd.

Zstd needs 3 bytes per 128 KB, and has a 22 byte fixed overhead.
Zstd needs to maintain 128 KB of space at all times, since that is
the maximum block size. See the comments regarding in-place
decompression added in lib/decompress_unzstd.c for details.

The existing code is written so that all the compression algorithms use
the same ZO_z_extra_bytes. It is taken to be the maximum of the growth
rate plus the maximum fixed overhead. The comments just above this diff
state that:
