ice: Fix link broken after GLOBR reset

After a GLOBR, the link was broken so that a link
up situation was being seen as a link down.

The problem was that the rebuild process was updating
the port_info link status without doing any of the
other things that need to be done when link changes.

This was causing the port_info struct to have current
"UP" information so that any further UP interrupts
were skipped as redundant.

The rebuild flow should *not* be updating the port_info
struct link information, so eliminate this and leave
it to the link event handling code.
