perf/x86/intel/lbr: Factor out rdlbr_all() and wrlbr_all()

The previous model-specific LBR and Architecture LBR (legacy way) use a
similar method to save/restore the LBR information, which directly
accesses the LBR registers. The codes which read/write a set of LBR
registers can be shared between them.

Factor out two functions which are used to read/write a set of LBR
registers.

Add lbr_info into structure x86_pmu, and use it to replace the hardcoded
LBR INFO MSR, because the LBR INFO MSR address of the previous
model-specific LBR is different from Architecture LBR. The MSR address
should be assigned at boot time. For now, only Sky Lake and later
platforms have the LBR INFO MSR.
