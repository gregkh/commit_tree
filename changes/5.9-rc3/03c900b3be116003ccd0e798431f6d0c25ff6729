soc: qcom: geni: Fix NULL pointer dereference

pdev struct doesn't exits for the devices whose status are disabled
from DT node, in such cases NULL is returned from 'of_find_device_by_node'
Later when we try to get drvdata from pdev struct NULL pointer dereference
is triggered.

Add a NULL check for return values to fix the issue.

We were hitting this issue when one of QUP is disabled.
