drm/msm/a6xx: fix frequency not always being restored on GMU resume

The patch reorganizing the set_freq function made it so the gmu resume
doesn't always set the frequency, because a6xx_gmu_set_freq() exits early
when the frequency hasn't been changed. Note this always happens when
resuming GMU after recovering from a hang.

Use a simple workaround to prevent this from happening.
