soundwire: intel_init: use EXPORT_SYMBOL_NS

Make sure all symbols in this soundwire-intel-init module are exported
with a namespace.

The MODULE_IMPORT_NS will be used in Intel/SOF HDaudio modules to be
posted in a separate series.

Namespaces are only introduced for the Intel parts of the SoundWire
code at this time, in future patches we should also add namespaces for
Cadence parts and the SoundWire core.
