drm/i915/gt: Ignore irq enabling on the virtual engines

We do not use the virtual engines for interrupts (they have physical
components), but we do use them to decouple the fence signaling during
submission. Currently, when we submit a completed request, we try to
enable the interrupt handler for the virtual engine, but we never disarm
it. A quick fix is then to mark the irq as enabled, and it will then
remain enabled -- and this prevents us from waking the device and never
letting it sleep again.
