ext4: correctly restore system zone info when remount fails

When remounting filesystem fails late during remount handling and
block_validity mount option is also changed during the remount, we fail
to restore system zone information to a state matching the mount option.
This is mostly harmless, just the block validity checking will not match
the situation described by the mount option. Make sure these two are always
consistent.
