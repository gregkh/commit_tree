PCI: Use 'pci_channel_state_t' instead of 'enum pci_channel_state'

The method struct pci_error_handlers.error_detected() is defined and
documented as taking an 'enum pci_channel_state' for the second argument,
but most drivers use 'pci_channel_state_t' instead.

This 'pci_channel_state_t' is not a typedef for the enum but a typedef for
a bitwise type in order to have better/stricter typechecking.

Consolidate everything by using 'pci_channel_state_t' in the method's
definition, in the related helpers and in the drivers.

Enforce use of 'pci_channel_state_t' by replacing 'enum pci_channel_state'
with an anonymous 'enum'.

Note: Currently, from a typechecking point of view this patch changes
nothing because only the constants defined by the enum are bitwise, not the
enum itself (sparse doesn't have the notion of 'bitwise enum'). This may
change in some not too far future, hence the patch.
