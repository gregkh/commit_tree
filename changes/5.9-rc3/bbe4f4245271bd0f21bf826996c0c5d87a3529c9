RDMA/qedr: Add EDPM mode type for user-fw compatibility

In older FW versions the completion flag was treated as the ack flag in
edpm messages.  commit ff937b916eb6 ("qed: Add EDPM mode type for user-fw
compatibility") exposed the FW option of setting which mode the QP is in
by adding a flag to the qedr <-> qed API.

This patch adds the qedr <-> libqedr interface so that the libqedr can set
the flag appropriately and qedr can pass it down to FW.  Flag is added for
backward compatibility with libqedr.

For older libs, this flag didn't exist and therefore set to zero.

Fixes: ac1b36e55a51 ("qedr: Add support for user context verbs")
