devlink: Rework devlink health reporter destructor

Devlink keeps its own reference to every reporter in a list and inits
refcount to 1 upon reporter's creation. Existing destructor waits to
free the memory indefinitely using msleep() until all references except
devlink's own are put.

Rework this mechanism by moving memory free routine to a separate
function, which is called when the last reporter reference is put.

Besides, it allows to call __devlink_health_reporter_destroy() while
locked on a reporters list mutex in symmetry to
__devlink_health_reporter_create(), which is required in follow-up
patch.
