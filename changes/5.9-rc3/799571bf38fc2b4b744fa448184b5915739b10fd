perf/x86/intel/lbr: Add the function pointers for LBR save and restore

The MSRs of Architectural LBR are different from previous model-specific
LBR. Perf has to implement different functions to save and restore them.

The function pointers for LBR save and restore are introduced. Perf
should initialize the corresponding functions at boot time.

The generic optimizations, e.g. avoiding restore LBR if no one else
touched them, still apply for Architectural LBRs. The related codes are
not moved to model-specific functions.

Current model-specific LBR functions are set as default.
