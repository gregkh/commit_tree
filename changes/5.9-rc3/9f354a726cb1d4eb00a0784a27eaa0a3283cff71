perf/x86/intel/lbr: Add a function pointer for LBR reset

The method to reset Architectural LBRs is different from previous
model-specific LBR. Perf has to implement a different function.

A function pointer is introduced for LBR reset. The enum of
LBR_FORMAT_* is also moved to perf_event.h. Perf should initialize the
corresponding functions at boot time, and avoid checking lbr_format at
run time.

The current 64-bit LBR reset function is set as default.
