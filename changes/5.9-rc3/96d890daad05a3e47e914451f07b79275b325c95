mptcp: add msk interations helper

mptcp_token_iter_next() allow traversing all the MPTCP
sockets inside the token container belonging to the given
network namespace with a quite standard iterator semantic.

That will be used by the next patch, but keep the API generic,
as we plan to use this later for PM's sake.

Additionally export mptcp_token_get_sock(), as it also
will be used by the diag module.
