powerpc/watchpoint: Remove 512 byte boundary

Power10 has removed 512 bytes boundary from match criteria i.e. the watch
range can cross 512 bytes boundary.

Note: ISA 3.1 Book III 9.4 match criteria includes 512 byte limit but that
is a documentation mistake and hopefully will be fixed in the next version
of ISA. Though, ISA 3.1 change log mentions about removal of 512B boundary:

  Multiple DEAW:
  Added a second Data Address Watchpoint. [H]DAR is
  set to the first byte of overlap. 512B boundary is
  removed.
