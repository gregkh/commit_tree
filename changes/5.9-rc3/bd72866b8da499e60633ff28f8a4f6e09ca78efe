alpha: fix annotation of io{read,write}{16,32}be()

These accessors must be used to read/write a big-endian bus.  The value
returned or written is native-endian.

However, these accessors are defined using be{16,32}_to_cpu() or
cpu_to_be{16,32}() to make the endian conversion but these expect a
__be{16,32} when none is present.  Keeping them would need a force cast
that would solve nothing at all.

So, do the conversion using swab{16,32}, like done in asm-generic for
similar situations.
