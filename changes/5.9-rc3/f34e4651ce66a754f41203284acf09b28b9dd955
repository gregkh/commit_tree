clk: bcm2835: Do not use prediv with bcm2711's PLLs

Contrary to previous SoCs, bcm2711 doesn't have a prescaler in the PLL
feedback loop. Bypass it by zeroing fb_prediv_mask when running on
bcm2711.

Note that, since the prediv configuration bits were re-purposed, this
was triggering miscalculations on all clocks hanging from the VPU clock,
notably the aux UART, making its output unintelligible.
