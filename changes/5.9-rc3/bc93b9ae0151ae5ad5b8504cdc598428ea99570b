vfio-pci: Avoid recursive read-lock usage

A down_read on memory_lock is held when performing read/write accesses
to MMIO BAR space, including across the copy_to/from_user() callouts
which may fault.  If the user buffer for these copies resides in an
mmap of device MMIO space, the mmap fault handler will acquire a
recursive read-lock on memory_lock.  Avoid this by reducing the lock
granularity.  Sequential accesses requiring multiple ioread/iowrite
cycles are expected to be rare, therefore typical accesses should not
see additional overhead.

VGA MMIO accesses are expected to be non-fatal regardless of the PCI
memory enable bit to allow legacy probing, this behavior remains with
a comment added.  ioeventfds are now included in memory access testing,
with writes dropped while memory space is disabled.
