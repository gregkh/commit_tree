ext4: fix checking of directory entry validity for inline directories

ext4_search_dir() and ext4_generic_delete_entry() can be called both for
standard director blocks and for inline directories stored inside inode
or inline xattr space. For the second case we didn't call
ext4_check_dir_entry() with proper constraints that could result in
accepting corrupted directory entry as well as false positive filesystem
errors like:

EXT4-fs error (device dm-0): ext4_search_dir:1395: inode #28320400:
block 113246792: comm dockerd: bad entry in directory: directory entry too
close to block end - offset=0, inode=28320403, rec_len=32, name_len=8,
size=4096

Fix the arguments passed to ext4_check_dir_entry().
