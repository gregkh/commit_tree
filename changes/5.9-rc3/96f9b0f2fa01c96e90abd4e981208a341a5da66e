btrfs: simplify checks when adding excluded ranges

Adresses held in 'logical' array are always guaranteed to fall within
the boundaries of the block group. That is, 'start' can never be
smaller than cache->start. This invariant follows from the way the
address are calculated in btrfs_rmap_block:

    stripe_nr = physical - map->stripes[i].physical;
    stripe_nr = div64_u64(stripe_nr, map->stripe_len);
    bytenr = chunk_start + stripe_nr * io_stripe_size;

I.e it's always some IO stripe within the given chunk.

Exploit this invariant to simplify the body of the loop by removing the
unnecessary 'if' since its 'else' part is the one always executed.
