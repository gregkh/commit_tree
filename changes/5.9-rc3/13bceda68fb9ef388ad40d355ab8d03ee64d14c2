platform/x86: asus-nb-wmi: add support for ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 and G15

Add device support for the new ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (GA401I) and
G15 (GA502I) series.

This is accomplished by two new quirk entries (one per each series),
as well as all current available G401I/G502I DMI_PRODUCT_NAMEs to match
the corresponding devices.
