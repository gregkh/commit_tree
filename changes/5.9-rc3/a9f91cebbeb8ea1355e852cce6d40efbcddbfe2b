misc: vmw_vmci_defs: Mark 'struct vmci_handle VMCI_ANON_SRC_HANDLE' as __maybe_unused

vmw_vmci_defs.h is included by multiple source files.  Some of which
do not make use of 'struct vmci_handle VMCI_ANON_SRC_HANDLE' rendering
it unused.  Ensure the compiler knows that this is in fact intentional
by marking it as __maybe_unused.  This fixes the following W=1 warnings:
