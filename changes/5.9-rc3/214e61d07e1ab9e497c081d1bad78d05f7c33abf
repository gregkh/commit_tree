btrfs: perform data management operations outside of inode lock

btrfs_alloc_data_chunk_ondemand and btrfs_free_reserved_data_space_noquota
don't really use the guts of the inodes being passed to them. This
implies it's not required to call them under extent lock. Move code
around in prealloc_file_extent_cluster to do the heavy, data alloc/free
operations outside of the lock. This also makes the 'out' label
unnecessary, so remove it.
