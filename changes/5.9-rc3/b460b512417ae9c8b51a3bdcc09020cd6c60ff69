powerpc/perf: Fix crashes with generic_compat_pmu & BHRB

The bhrb_filter_map ("The Branch History Rolling Buffer") callback is
only defined in raw CPUs' power_pmu structs. The "architected" CPUs
use generic_compat_pmu, which does not have this callback, and crashes
occur if a user tries to enable branch stack for an event.

This add a NULL pointer check for bhrb_filter_map() which behaves as
if the callback returned an error.

This does not add the same check for config_bhrb() as the only caller
checks for cpuhw->bhrb_users which remains zero if bhrb_filter_map==0.
