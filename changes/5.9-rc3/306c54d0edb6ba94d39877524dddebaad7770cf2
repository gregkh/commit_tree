usb: hcd: Try MSI interrupts on PCI devices

It appears that some platforms share same IRQ line between several devices,
some of which are EHCI and OHCI controllers. This is neither practical nor
performance-wise, especially in the case when they are supporting MSI.

In order to improve the situation try to allocate MSI and fallback to legacy
IRQ if no MSI available.
