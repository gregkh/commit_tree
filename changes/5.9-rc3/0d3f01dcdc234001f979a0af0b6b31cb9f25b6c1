ASoC: meson: axg-tdm-formatters: fix sclk inversion

After carefully checking, it appears that both tdmout and tdmin require the
rising edge of the sclk they get to be synchronized with the frame sync
event (which should be a rising edge of lrclk).

TDMIN was improperly set before this patch. Remove the sclk_invert quirk
which is no longer needed and fix the sclk phase.
