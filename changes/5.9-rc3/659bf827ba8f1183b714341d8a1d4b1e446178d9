block: add max_active_zones to blk-sysfs

Add a new max_active zones definition in the sysfs documentation.
This definition will be common for all devices utilizing the zoned block
device support in the kernel.

Export max_active_zones according to this new definition for NVMe Zoned
Namespace devices, ZAC ATA devices (which are treated as SCSI devices by
the kernel), and ZBC SCSI devices.

Add the new max_active_zones member to struct request_queue, rather
than as a queue limit, since this property cannot be split across stacking
drivers.

For SCSI devices, even though max active zones is not part of the ZBC/ZAC
spec, export max_active_zones as 0, signifying "no limit".
