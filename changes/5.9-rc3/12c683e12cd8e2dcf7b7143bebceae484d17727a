drm: bridge: Pass drm_display_info to drm_bridge_funcs .mode_valid()

When validating a mode, bridges may need to do so in the context of a
display, as specified by drm_display_info. An example is the meson
dw-hdmi bridge that needs to consider the YUV 4:2:0 output format to
perform clock calculations.

Bridges that need the display info currently retrieve it from the
drm_connector created by the bridge. This gets in the way of moving
connector creation out of bridge drivers. To make this possible, pass
the drm_display_info to drm_bridge_funcs .mode_valid().

Changes to the bridge drivers have been performed with the following
coccinelle semantic patch and have been compile-tested.
