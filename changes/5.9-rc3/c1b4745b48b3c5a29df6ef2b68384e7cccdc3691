perf pmu: List kernel supplied event aliases for arm64

In commit dc098b35b56f ("perf list: List kernel supplied event aliases"),
the aliases for events are supplied in addition to CPU event in perf list.

This relies on the name of the core PMU being "cpu", which is not the case
for arm64, so arm64 has always missed this. Use generic is_pmu_core()
helper which takes account of arm64 to make this feature work for arm64
(and possibly other archs).

Sample, before:

  armv8_pmuv3_0/br_mis_pred/          [Kernel PMU event]

after:

  br_mis_pred OR armv8_pmuv3_0/br_mis_pred/          [Kernel PMU event]
