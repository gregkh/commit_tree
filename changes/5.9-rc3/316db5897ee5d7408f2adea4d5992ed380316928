torture: Avoid duplicate specification of qemu command

Currently, the qemu command is constructed twice, once to dump it
to the qemu-cmd file and again to execute it.  This is of course an
accident waiting to happen, but is done to ensure that the remainder
of the script has an accurate idea of the running qemu command's PID.
This commit therefore places both the qemu command and the PID capture
into a new temporary file and sources that temporary file.  Thus the
single construction of the qemu command into the qemu-cmd file suffices
for both purposes.
