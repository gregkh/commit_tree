rcu/tree: Skip entry into the page allocator for PREEMPT_RT

To keep the kfree_rcu() code working in purely atomic sections on RT,
such as non-threaded IRQ handlers and raw spinlock sections, avoid
calling into the page allocator which uses sleeping locks on RT.

In fact, even if the  caller is preemptible, the kfree_rcu() code is
not, as the krcp->lock is a raw spinlock.

Calling into the page allocator is optional and avoiding it should be
Ok, especially with the page pre-allocation support in future patches.
Such pre-allocation would further avoid the a need for a dynamically
allocated page in the first place.
