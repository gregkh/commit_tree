device property: Fix the secondary firmware node handling in set_primary_fwnode()

When the primary firmware node pointer is removed from a
device (set to NULL) the secondary firmware node pointer,
when it exists, is made the primary node for the device.
However, the secondary firmware node pointer of the original
primary firmware node is never cleared (set to NULL).

To avoid situation where the secondary firmware node pointer
is pointing to a non-existing object, clearing it properly
when the primary node is removed from a device in
set_primary_fwnode().
