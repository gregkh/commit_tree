PCI: altera: Use pci_host_probe() to register host

The altera host driver does the same host registration and bus scanning
calls as pci_host_probe, so let's use it instead.

The only difference is pci_assign_unassigned_bus_resources() was called
instead of pci_bus_size_bridges() and pci_bus_assign_resources(). This
should be the same.
