bpf: Fix cross build for CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF option

Stephen and 0-DAY CI Kernel Test Service reported broken cross build
for arm (arm-linux-gnueabi-gcc (GCC) 9.3.0), with following output:

   /tmp/ccMS5uth.s: Assembler messages:
   /tmp/ccMS5uth.s:69: Error: unrecognized symbol type ""
   /tmp/ccMS5uth.s:82: Error: unrecognized symbol type ""

Having '@object' for .type  diretive is  wrong because '@' is comment
character for some architectures. Using STT_OBJECT instead that should
work everywhere.

Also using HOST* variables to build resolve_btfids so it's properly
build in crossbuilds (stolen from objtool's Makefile).
