powerpc/powernv/pci: Add explicit tracking of the DMA setup state

There's an optimisation in the PE setup which skips performing DMA
setup for a PE if we only have bridges in a PE. The assumption being
that only "real" devices will DMA to system memory, which is probably
fair. However, if we start off with only bridge devices in a PE then
add a non-bridge device the new device won't be able to use DMA because
we never configured it.

Fix this (admittedly pretty weird) edge case by tracking whether we've done
the DMA setup for the PE or not. If a non-bridge device is added to the PE
(via rescan or hotplug, or whatever) we can set up DMA on demand.

This also means the only remaining user of the old "DMA Weight" code is
the IODA1 DMA setup code that it was originally added for, which is good.
