ceph: use frag's MDS in either mode

When doing some tests with multiple mds, we were seeing many mds
forwarding requests between them, causing clients to resend.

If the request is a modification operation and the mode is set to
USE_AUTH_MDS, then the auth mds should be selected to handle the
request. If auth mds for frag is already set, then it should be returned
directly without further processing.

The current logic is wrong because it only returns directly if
mode is USE_AUTH_MDS, but we want to do that for all modes. If we don't,
then when the frag's mds is not equal to cap session's mds, the request
will get sent to the wrong MDS needlessly.

Drop the mode check in this condition.
