of: address: Work around missing device_type property in pcie nodes

Recent changes to the DT PCI bus parsing made it mandatory for
device tree nodes describing a PCI controller to have the
'device_type = "pci"' property for the node to be matched.

Although this follows the letter of the specification, it
breaks existing device-trees that have been working fine
for years.  Rockchip rk3399-based systems are a prime example
of such collateral damage, and have stopped discovering their
PCI bus.

In order to paper over it, let's add a workaround to the code
matching the device type, and accept as PCI any node that is
named "pcie",

A warning will hopefully nudge the user into updating their
DT to a fixed version if they can, but the incentive is
obviously pretty small.
