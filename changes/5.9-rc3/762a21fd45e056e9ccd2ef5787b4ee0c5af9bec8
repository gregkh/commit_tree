irqchip: Fix IRQCHIP_PLATFORM_DRIVER_* compilation by including module.h

The newly introduced IRQCHIP_PLATFORM_DRIVER_* macros expand into
module-related macros, but do so without including module.h.
Depending on the driver and/or architecture, this happens to work,
or not.

Unconditionnaly include linux/module.h to sort it out.
