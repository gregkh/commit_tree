clk: Add support for enabling/disabling clocks from debugfs

For test and debug purposes, it's simple enough to enable or disable
clocks from shell. Add a new debugfs file 'clk_prepare_enable' that
calls clk_prepare_enable() when writing "1" and clk_disable_unprepare()
when writing "0".

This can have security implications, so only support it when the code
has been modified to #define CLOCK_ALLOW_WRITE_DEBUGFS.
