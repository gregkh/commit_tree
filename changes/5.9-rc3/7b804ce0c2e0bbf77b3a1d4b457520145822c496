regulator: cpcap-regulator: Demote kerneldoc header to standard comment

Nothing about this comment identifies it as a kerneldoc header.
They're missing all of their struct's property descriptions and
the correct 'struct *' header.

Fixes the following W=1 warning(s):

 drivers/regulator/cpcap-regulator.c:99: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'struct cpcap_regulator '
 drivers/regulator/cpcap-regulator.c:337: warning: cannot understand function prototype: 'const struct cpcap_regulator omap4_regulators[] = '
