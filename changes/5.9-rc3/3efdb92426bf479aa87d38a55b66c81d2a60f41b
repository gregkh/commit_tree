dt-bindings: net: dwmac-meson: Add a compatible string for G12A onwards

Amlogic Meson G12A, G12B and SM1 have the same (at least as far as we
know at the time of writing) PRG_ETHERNET glue register implementation.
This implementation however is slightly different from AXG as it now has
an undocument "auto cali idx val" register in PRG_ETH1[17:16] which
seems to be related to RGMII Ethernet.

Add a compatible string for G12A and newer so the new registers can be
used.
