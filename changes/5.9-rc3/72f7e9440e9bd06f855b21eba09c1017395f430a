udp: Run SK_LOOKUP BPF program on socket lookup

Following INET/TCP socket lookup changes, modify UDP socket lookup to let
BPF program select a receiving socket before searching for a socket by
destination address and port as usual.

Lookup of connected sockets that match packet 4-tuple is unaffected by this
change. BPF program runs, and potentially overrides the lookup result, only
if a 4-tuple match was not found.
