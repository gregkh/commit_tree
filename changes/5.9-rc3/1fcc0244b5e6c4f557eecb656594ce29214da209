media: staging: rkisp1: stats: read the stats in the isr

Currently the stats are read in a work queue. Defering the
reading of the stats is not needed and it is fine to read them
inside the irq handler.
This patch fixes and remove the TODO item:
'Use threaded interrupt for rkisp1_stats_isr(), remove work queue.'
