dyndbg: refine debug verbosity; 1 is basic, 2 more chatty

The verbose/debug logging done for `cat $MNT/dynamic_debug/control` is
voluminous (2 per control file entry + 2 per PAGE).  Moreover, it just
prints pointer and sequence, which is not useful to a dyndbg user.
So just drop them.

Also require verbose>=2 for several other debug printks that are a bit
too chatty for typical needs;

ddebug_change() prints changes, once per modified callsite.  Since
queries like "+p" will enable ~2300 callsites in a typical laptop, a
user probably doesn't need to see them often.  ddebug_exec_queries()
still summarizes with verbose=1.

ddebug_(add|remove)_module() also print 1 line per action on a module,
not needed by typical modprobe user.

This leaves verbose=1 better focussed on the >control parsing process.
