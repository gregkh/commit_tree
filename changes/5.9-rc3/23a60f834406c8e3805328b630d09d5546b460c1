s390/kvm: diagnose 0x318 sync and reset

DIAGNOSE 0x318 (diag318) sets information regarding the environment
the VM is running in (Linux, z/VM, etc) and is observed via
firmware/service events.

This is a privileged s390x instruction that must be intercepted by
SIE. Userspace handles the instruction as well as migration. Data
is communicated via VCPU register synchronization.

The Control Program Name Code (CPNC) is stored in the SIE block. The
CPNC along with the Control Program Version Code (CPVC) are stored
in the kvm_vcpu_arch struct.

This data is reset on load normal and clear resets.
