perf/x86/rapl: Add Hygon Fam18h RAPL support

Hygon Family 18h(Dhyana) support RAPL in bit 14 of CPUID 0x80000007 EDX,
and has MSRs RAPL_PWR_UNIT/CORE_ENERGY_STAT/PKG_ENERGY_STAT. So add Hygon
Dhyana Family 18h support for RAPL.

The output is available via the energy-pkg pseudo event:

  $ perf stat -a -I 1000 --per-socket -e power/energy-pkg/

[ mingo: Tidied up the initializers. ]
