ASoC: Intel: Boards: tgl_max98373: add dai_trigger function

Speaker amplifier feedback is not modeled as being dependent on any
active output. Even when there is no playback happening, parts of the
graph, specifically the IV sense->speaker protection->output remains
active and this prevents the DSP from entering low-power states.

This patch suggests a machine driver level approach where the speaker
pins are enabled/disabled dynamically depending on stream start/stop
events. DPAM graph representations show the feedback loop is indeed
disabled and low-power states can be reached.
