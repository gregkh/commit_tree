drm: bridge: dw-hdmi: Pass drm_display_info to .mode_valid()

Replace the drm_connector pointer passed to the .mode_valid() function
with a const drm_display_info pointer, as that's all the function should
need. Use the display info passed to the bridge .mode_valid() operation
instead of retrieving it from the connector, to prepare for make
connector creation optional.
