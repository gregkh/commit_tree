usb: bdc: Halt controller on suspend

GISB bus error kernel panics have been observed during S2 transition
tests on the 7271t platform. The errors are a result of the BDC
interrupt handler trying to access BDC register space after the
system's suspend callbacks have completed.

Adding a suspend hook to the BDC driver that halts the controller before
S2 entry thus preventing unwanted access to the BDC register space during
this transition.
