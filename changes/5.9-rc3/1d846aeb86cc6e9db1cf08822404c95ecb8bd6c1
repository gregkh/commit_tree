perf intel-pt: Use itrace error flags to suppress some errors

The itrace "e" option may be followed by flags which affect what errors
will or will not be reported.  Each flag must be preceded by either '+' or '-'.
The flags supported by Intel PT are:

		-o	Suppress overflow errors
		-l	Suppress trace data lost errors
For example, for errors but not overflow or data lost errors:

	--itrace=e-o-l

Suppressing those errors can be useful for testing and debugging because
they are not due to decoding.
