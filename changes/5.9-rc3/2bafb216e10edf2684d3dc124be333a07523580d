mlxsw: spectrum_span: Add APIs to enable / disable global mirroring triggers

While the binding of global mirroring triggers to a SPAN agent is
global, packets are only mirrored if they belong to a port and TC on
which the trigger was enabled. This allows, for example, to mirror
packets that were tail-dropped on a specific netdev.

Implement the operations that allow to enable / disable a global
mirroring trigger on a specific port and TC.
