ASoC: Add bindings for Samsung Aries audio complex

The audio system on S5PV210 Aries boards have a wm8994 codec connected
to the Samsung I2S0 DAI.  Jack detection is done via GPIOs, an ADC, and
an extcon device (fsa9480).

There are two main variants, one with an FM radio and where the wm8994 is
the master for the modem audio and the other without FM and the modem is
the master.
