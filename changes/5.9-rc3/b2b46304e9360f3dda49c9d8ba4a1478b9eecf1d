powerpc: re-initialise lazy FPU/VEC counters on every fault

When a FP/VEC/VSX unavailable fault loads registers and enables the
facility in the MSR, re-set the lazy restore counters to 1 rather
than incrementing them so every fault gets the same number of
restores before the next fault.

This probably shouldn't be a practical change because if a lazy counter
was non-zero then it should have been restored and would not cause a
fault when userspace tries to access it. However the code and comment
implies otherwise so that's misleading and unnecessary.
