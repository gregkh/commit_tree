torture: Pass --kmake-arg to all make invocations

We need to pass the arguments provided to --kmake-arg to all make
invocations. In particular, the make invocations generating the configs
need to see the final make arguments, e.g. if config variables depend on
particular variables that are passed to make.

For example, when using '--kcsan --kmake-arg CC=clang-11', we would lose
CONFIG_KCSAN=y due to 'make oldconfig' not seeing that we want to use a
compiler that supports KCSAN.
