drm/i915/rkl: Don't try to read out DSI transcoders

RKL doesn't have DSI outputs, so we shouldn't try to read out the DSI
transcoder registers.

v2(MattR):
 - Just set the 'extra panel mask' to edp | dsi0 | dsi1 and then mask
   against the platform's cpu_transcoder_mask to filter out the ones
   that don't exist on a given platform.  (Ville)

v3(MattR):
 - Only include DSI transcoders on gen11+ again. (Ville)
 - Use for_each_cpu_transcoder_masked() for loop. (Ville)
