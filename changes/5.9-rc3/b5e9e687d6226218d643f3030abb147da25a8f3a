soundwire: cadence: allocate/free dma_data in set_sdw_stream

The current memory allocation is somewhat strange: the dma_data is
allocated in set_sdw_stream, but released in the intel DAI
shutdown. This no longer works with the multi-cpu implementation,
since the dma_data is released in the dai shutdown which takes place
before the dailink shutdown.

Move to a more symmetric allocation where the dma_data is allocated
with non-NULL SoundWire stream, and conversely released when a NULL
stream is provided - for consistency with the stream startup and
shutdown operations.
