hw_breakpoint: Remove unused __register_perf_hw_breakpoint() declaration

Commit:

  b326e9560a28 ("hw-breakpoints: Use overflow handler instead of the event callback")

removed __register_perf_hw_breakpoint() function usage and replaced it
with register_perf_hw_breakpoint() function.

Remove the left-over unused __register_perf_hw_breakpoint() declaration
from <linux/hw_breakpoint.h> as well.
