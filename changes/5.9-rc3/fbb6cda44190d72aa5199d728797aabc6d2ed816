crypto: algapi - introduce the flag CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY

Introduce a new algorithm flag CRYPTO_ALG_ALLOCATES_MEMORY.  If this
flag is set, then the driver allocates memory in its request routine.
Such drivers are not suitable for disk encryption because GFP_ATOMIC
allocation can fail anytime (causing random I/O errors) and GFP_KERNEL
allocation can recurse into the block layer, causing a deadlock.

For now, this flag is only implemented for some algorithm types.  We
also assume some usage constraints for it to be meaningful, since there
are lots of edge cases the crypto API allows (e.g., misaligned or
fragmented scatterlists) that mean that nearly any crypto algorithm can
allocate memory in some case.  See the comment for details.

Also add this flag to CRYPTO_ALG_INHERITED_FLAGS so that when a template
is instantiated, this flag is set on the template instance if it is set
on any algorithm the instance uses.
