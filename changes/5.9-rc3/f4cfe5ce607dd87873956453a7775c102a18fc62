usb: cdns3: gadget: improve the set_configuration handling

- Delete the duplicated EP_CMD_ERDY and EP_CMD_REQ_CMPL setting
- Prepare the next setup before setting EP_CMD_ERDY and EP_CMD_REQ_CMPL,
it could avoid a bug that DMA hang at EP0 OUT for DEV_VER_NXP_V1
- Delete the duplicated cdns3_set_hw_configuration calling at
cdns3_req_ep0_set_configuration, the composite.c will handle
this request, and call .ep0_queue back, and at .ep_queue it will
call cdns3_set_hw_configuration.
- Move cdns3_allow_enable_l1 into cdns3_set_hw_configuration since
it is part of this function.
