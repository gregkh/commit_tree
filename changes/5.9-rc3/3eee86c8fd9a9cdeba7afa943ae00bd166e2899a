btrfs: don't check for btrfs_device::bdev in btrfs_end_bio

btrfs_map_bio ensures that all submitted bios to devices have valid
btrfs_device::bdev so this check can be removed from btrfs_end_bio. This
check was added in june 2012 597a60fadedf ("Btrfs: don't count I/O
statistic read errors for missing devices") but then in October of the
same year another commit de1ee92ac3bc ("Btrfs: recheck bio against
block device when we map the bio") started checking for the presence of
btrfs_device::bdev before actually issuing the bio.
