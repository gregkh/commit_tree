drm/mipi-dbi: Remove ->enabled

The atomic helpers try really hard to not lose track of things,
duplicating enabled tracking in the driver is at best confusing.
Double-enabling or disabling is a bug in atomic helpers.

In the fb_dirty function we can just assume that the fb always exists,
simple display pipe helpers guarantee that the crtc is only enabled
together with the output, so we always have a primary plane around.

Now in the update function we need to be a notch more careful, since
that can also get called when the crtc is off. And we don't want to
upload frames when that's the case, so filter that out too.
