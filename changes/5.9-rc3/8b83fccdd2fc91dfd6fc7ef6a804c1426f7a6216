perf intel-pt: Use itrace debug log flags to suppress some messages

The "d" option may be followed by flags which affect what debug messages
will or will not be logged. Each flag must be preceded by either '+' or
'-'. The flags support by Intel PT are:

		-a	Suppress logging of perf events

Suppressing perf events is useful for decreasing the size of the log.
