refperf: Rename refperf.c to refscale.c and change internal names

This commit further avoids conflation of refperf with the kernel's perf
feature by renaming kernel/rcu/refperf.c to kernel/rcu/refscale.c,
and also by similarly renaming the functions and variables inside
this file.  This has the side effect of changing the names of the
kernel boot parameters, so kernel-parameters.txt and ver_functions.sh
are also updated.

The rcutorture --torture type remains refperf, and this will be
addressed in a separate commit.
