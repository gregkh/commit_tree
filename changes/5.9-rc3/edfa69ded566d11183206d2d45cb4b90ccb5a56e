mmc: sdhci-iproc: Do not define 'struct acpi_device_id' when !CONFIG_ACPI

Since ACPI_PTR() is used to NULLify the value when !CONFIG_ACPI,
'struct sdhci_iproc_acpi_ids' becomes defined but unused.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning:

 mmc/host/sdhci-iproc.c:297:36: warning: ‘sdhci_iproc_acpi_ids’ defined but not used [-Wunused-const-variable=]
