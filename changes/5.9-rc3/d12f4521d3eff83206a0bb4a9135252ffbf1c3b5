net/mlx5e: CT: Expand tunnel register mappings

Reg_c1 is 32 bits wide. Originally, 24 bit were allocated for the tuple_id,
6 bits for tunnel mapping and 2 bits for tunnel options mappings.

Restoring the ct state from zone lookup instead of tuple id requires
reg_c1 to store 8 bits mapping the ct zone, leaving 24 bits for tunnel
mappings.

Expand tunnel and tunnel options register mappings to 12 bit each.
