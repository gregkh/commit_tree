media: ti-vpe: cal: Hardcode virtual channel to 0

Using the endpoint reg value to pass the CSI-2 source virtual channel ID
in DT is a hack, isn't documented in the DT bindings, and isn't used in
neither upstream DT nor TI official overlays. Hardcode the virtual
channel to 0 to simplify reworking the code, proper virtual channel
support will be implemented later.
