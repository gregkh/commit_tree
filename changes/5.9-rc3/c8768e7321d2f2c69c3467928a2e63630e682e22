ionic: set netdev default name

If the host system's udev fails to set a new name for the
network port, there is no NETDEV_CHANGENAME event to trigger
the driver to send the name down to the firmware.  It is safe
to set the lif name multiple times, so we add a call early on
to set the default netdev name to be sure the FW has something
to use in its internal debug logging.  Then when udev gets
around to changing it we can update it to the actual name the
system will be using.
