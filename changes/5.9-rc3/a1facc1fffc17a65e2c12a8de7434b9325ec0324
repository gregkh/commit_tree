ACPI: NFIT: Add runtime firmware activate support

Plumb the platform specific backend for the generic libnvdimm firmware
activate interface. Register dimm level operations to arm/disarm
activation, and register bus level operations to report the dynamic
platform-quiesce time relative to the number of dimms armed for firmware
activation.

A new nfit-specific bus attribute "firmware_activate_noidle" is added to
allow the activation to switch between platform enforced, and OS
opportunistic device quiesce. In other words, let the hibernate cycle
handle in-flight device-dma rather than the platform attempting to
increase PCI-E timeouts and the like.
