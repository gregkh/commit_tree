btrfs: handle errors from async submission

Btrfs' async submit mechanism is able to handle errors in the submission
path and the meta-data async submit function correctly passes the error
code to the caller.

In btrfs_submit_bio_start() and btrfs_submit_bio_start_direct_io() we're
not handling the errors returned by btrfs_csum_one_bio() correctly though
and simply call BUG_ON(). This is unnecessary as the caller of these two
functions - run_one_async_start - correctly checks for the return values
and sets the status of the async_submit_bio. The actual bio submission
will be handled later on by run_one_async_done only if
async_submit_bio::status is 0, so the data won't be written if we
encountered an error in the checksum process.

Simply return the error from btrfs_csum_one_bio() to the async submitters,
like it's done in btree_submit_bio_start().
