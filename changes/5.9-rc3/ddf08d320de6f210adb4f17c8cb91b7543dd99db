drm/i915/fbc: Enable fbc on i865

Unlike all the other pre-snb desktop platforms i865 actually
supports FBC. Let's enable it.

Quote from the spec:
"DevSDG provides the same Run-Length Encoded Frame Buffer
 Compression (RLEFBC) function as exists in DevMGM."

As i865 only has the one pipe we want to skip massaging the
plane<->pipe assignment aimed at getting FBC+LVDS working on
the mobile platforms.
