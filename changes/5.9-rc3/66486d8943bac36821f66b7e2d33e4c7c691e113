ice: replace single-element array used for C struct hack

Convert the pre-C90-extension "C struct hack" method (using a single-
element array at the end of a structure for implementing variable-length
types) to the preferred use of C99 flexible array member.

Additional code cleanups were done near areas affected by this change.
