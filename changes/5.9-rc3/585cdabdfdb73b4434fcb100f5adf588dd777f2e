ice: rename misleading grst_delay variable

The grst_delay variable in ice_check_reset contains the maximum time
(in 100 msec units) that the driver will wait for a reset event to
transition to the Device Active state. The value is the sum of three
separate components:
1) The maximum time it may take for the firmware to process its
outstanding command before handling the reset request.
2) The value in RSTCTL.GRSTDEL (the delay firmware inserts between first
seeing the driver reset request and the actual hardware assertion).
3) The maximum expected reset processing time in hardware.

Referring to this total time as "grst_delay" is misleading and
potentially confusing to someone checking the code and cross-referencing
the hardware specification.

Fix this by renaming the variable to "grst_timeout", which is more
descriptive of its actual use.
