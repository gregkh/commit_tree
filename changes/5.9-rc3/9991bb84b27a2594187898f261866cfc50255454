kernfs: do not call fsnotify() with name without a parent

When creating an FS_MODIFY event on inode itself (not on parent)
the file_name argument should be NULL.

The change to send a non NULL name to inode itself was done on purpuse
as part of another commit, as Tejun writes: "...While at it, supply the
target file name to fsnotify() from kernfs_node->name.".

But this is wrong practice and inconsistent with inotify behavior when
watching a single file.  When a child is being watched (as opposed to the
parent directory) the inotify event should contain the watch descriptor,
but not the file name.
