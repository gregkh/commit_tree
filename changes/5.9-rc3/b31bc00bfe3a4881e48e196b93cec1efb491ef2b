Bluetooth: Translate additional address type during le_conn

When using controller based address resolution, then the new address
types 0x02 and 0x03 are used. These types need to be converted back into
either public address or random address types.

This patch is specially during LE_CREATE_CONN if using own_add_type as 0x02
or 0x03.
