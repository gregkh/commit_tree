nvme: introduce nvme_execute_passthru_rq to call nvme_passthru_[start|end]()

Introduce a new nvme_execute_passthru_rq() helper which calls
nvme_passthru_[start|end]() around blk_execute_rq(). This ensures
all passthru calls (including nvme_submit_io()) will be wrapped
appropriately.

nvme_execute_passthru_rq() will also be useful for the nvmet passthru
code and is exported in the NVME_TARGET_PASSTHRU namespace.
