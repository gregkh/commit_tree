selftests/powerpc: Add test of memcmp at end of page

Update our memcmp selftest, to test the case where we're comparing up
to the end of a page and the subsequent page is not mapped. We have to
make sure we don't read off the end of the page and cause a fault.

We had a bug there in the past, fixed in commit
d9470757398a ("powerpc/64: Fix memcmp reading past the end of src/dest").
