dt-bindings: media: xilinx: Replace HTTP links with HTTPS ones

Rationale:
Reduces attack surface on kernel devs opening the links for MITM
as HTTPS traffic is much harder to manipulate.

Deterministic algorithm:
For each file:
  If not .svg:
    For each line:
      If doesn't contain `\bxmlns\b`:
        For each link, `\bhttp://[^# \t\r\n]*(?:\w|/)`:
          If both the HTTP and HTTPS versions
          return 200 OK and serve the same content:
            Replace HTTP with HTTPS.
