KVM: arm64: Use common code's approach for __GFP_ZERO with memory caches

Add a "gfp_zero" member to arm64's 'struct kvm_mmu_memory_cache' to make
the struct and its usage compatible with the common 'struct
kvm_mmu_memory_cache' in linux/kvm_host.h.  This will minimize code
churn when arm64 moves to the common implementation in a future patch, at
the cost of temporarily having somewhat silly code.

Note, GFP_PGTABLE_USER is equivalent to GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT | GFP_ZERO:

  #define GFP_PGTABLE_USER  (GFP_PGTABLE_KERNEL | __GFP_ACCOUNT)
  |
  -> #define GFP_PGTABLE_KERNEL        (GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ZERO)

  == GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ACCOUNT | __GFP_ZERO

versus

  #define GFP_KERNEL_ACCOUNT (GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ACCOUNT)

    with __GFP_ZERO explicitly OR'd in

  == GFP_KERNEL | __GFP_ACCOUNT | __GFP_ZERO

No functional change intended.
