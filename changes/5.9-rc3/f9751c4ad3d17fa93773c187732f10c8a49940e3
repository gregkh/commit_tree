xfs: drop the type parameter from xfs_dquot_verify

xfs_qm_reset_dqcounts (aka quotacheck) is the only xfs_dqblk_verify
caller that actually knows the specific quota type that it's looking
for.  Since everything else just pass in type==0 (including the buffer
verifier), drop the parameter and open-code the check like
xfs_dquot_from_disk already does.
