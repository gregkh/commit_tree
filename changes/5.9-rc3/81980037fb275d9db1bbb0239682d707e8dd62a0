drm: bridge: dw-hdmi: Pass drm_connector to internal functions as needed

To prepare for making connector creation optional in the driver, pass
the drm_connector explicitly to the internal functions that require it.
The functions that still access the connector from the dw_hdmi structure
are dw_hdmi_connector_create() and __dw_hdmi_probe(). The former access
is expected, as that's where the internal connector is created. The
latter will be addressed separately.
