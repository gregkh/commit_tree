arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Pull down PDM GPIOs during sleep

The original qcom kernel changed the PDM GPIOs to be pull-down
during sleep at some point. Reportedly this was done because
there was some "leakage at PDM outputs during sleep":

I cannot say how effective this is, but everything seems to work
fine with this change so let's apply the same to mainline just
to be sure.
