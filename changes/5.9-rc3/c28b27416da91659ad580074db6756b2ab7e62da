openrisc: Implement proper SMP tlb flushing

Up until now when flushing pages from the TLB on SMP OpenRISC was always
resorting to flush the entire TLB on all CPUs.  This patch adds the
mechanics for flushing specific ranges and pages based on the usage.

The function switch_mm is updated to account for cpu usage by updating
mm_struct's cpumask.  This is used in the SMP flush routines.

This mostly follows the riscv implementation.
