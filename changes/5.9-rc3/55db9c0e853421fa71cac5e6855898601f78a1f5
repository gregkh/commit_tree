net: remove compat_sys_{get,set}sockopt

Now that the ->compat_{get,set}sockopt proto_ops methods are gone
there is no good reason left to keep the compat syscalls separate.

This fixes the odd use of unsigned int for the compat_setsockopt
optlen and the missing sock_use_custom_sol_socket.

It would also easily allow running the eBPF hooks for the compat
syscalls, but such a large change in behavior does not belong into
a consolidation patch like this one.
