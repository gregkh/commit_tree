drm/i915: Introduce for_each_dbuf_slice_in_mask macro

We quite often need now to iterate only particular dbuf slices
in mask, whether they are active or related to particular crtc.

v2: - Minor code refactoring
v3: - Use enum for max slices instead of macro

Let's make our life a bit easier and use a macro for that.
