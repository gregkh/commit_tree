soundwire: intel: add wake interrupt support

When system is suspended in clock stop mode on intel platforms, both
master and slave are in clock stop mode and soundwire bus is taken
over by a glue hardware. The bus message for jack event is processed
by this glue hardware, which will trigger an interrupt to resume audio
pci device. Then audio pci driver will resume soundwire master and slave,
transfer bus ownership to master, finally slave will report jack event
to master and codec driver is triggered to check jack status.

if a slave has been attached to a bus, the slave->dev_num_sticky
should be non-zero, so we can check this value to skip the
ghost devices defined in ACPI table but not populated in hardware.
