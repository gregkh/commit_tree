nvme: just check the status code type in nvme_is_path_error

Check the SCT sub-field for a path related status instead of enumerating
invididual status code.  As of NVMe 1.4 this adds "Internal Path Error"
and "Controller Pathing Error" to the list, but it also future proofs for
additional status codes added to the category.
