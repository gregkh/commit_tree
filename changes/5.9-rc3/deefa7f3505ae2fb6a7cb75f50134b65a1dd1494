fs: Add receive_fd() wrapper for __receive_fd()

For both pidfd and seccomp, the __user pointer is not used. Update
__receive_fd() to make writing to ufd optional via a NULL check. However,
for the receive_fd_user() wrapper, ufd is NULL checked so an -EFAULT
can be returned to avoid changing the SCM_RIGHTS interface behavior. Add
new wrapper receive_fd() for pidfd and seccomp that does not use the ufd
argument. For the new helper, the allocated fd needs to be returned on
success. Update the existing callers to handle it.
