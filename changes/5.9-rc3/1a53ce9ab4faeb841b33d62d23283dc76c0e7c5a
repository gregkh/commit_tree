soc: qcom: rpmh-rsc: Set suppress_bind_attrs flag

rpmh-rsc driver is fairly core to system and should not be removable
once its probed. However it allows to unbind driver from sysfs using
below command which results into a crash on sc7180.

echo 18200000.rsc > /sys/bus/platform/drivers/rpmh/unbind

Lets prevent unbind at runtime by setting suppress_bind_attrs flag.
