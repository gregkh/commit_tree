net/smc: unique reason code for exceeded max dmb count

When the maximum dmb buffer limit for an ism device is reached no more
dmb buffers can be registered. When this happens the reason code is set
to SMC_CLC_DECL_MEM indicating out-of-memory. This is the same reason
code that is used when no memory could be allocated for the new dmb
buffer.
This is confusing for users when they see this error but there is more
memory available. To solve this set a separate new reason code when the
maximum dmb limit exceeded.
