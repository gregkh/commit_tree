mlxsw: spectrum_cnt: Use flex_array_size() helper in memcpy()

Make use of the flex_array_size() helper to calculate the size of a
flexible array member within an enclosing structure.

This helper offers defense-in-depth against potential integer
overflows, while at the same time makes it explicitly clear that
we are dealing witha flexible array member.

Also, remove unnecessary pointer identifier sub_pool.
