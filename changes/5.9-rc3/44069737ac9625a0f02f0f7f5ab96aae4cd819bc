crypto: aesni - add compatibility with IAS

Clang's integrated assembler complains "invalid reassignment of
non-absolute variable 'var_ddq_add'" while assembling
arch/x86/crypto/aes_ctrby8_avx-x86_64.S. It was because var_ddq_add was
reassigned with non-absolute values several times, which IAS did not
support. We can avoid the reassignment by replacing the uses of
var_ddq_add with its definitions accordingly to have compatilibility
with IAS.
