b43: Remove uninitialized_var() usage

Using uninitialized_var() is dangerous as it papers over real bugs[1]
(or can in the future), and suppresses unrelated compiler warnings (e.g.
"unused variable"). If the compiler thinks it is uninitialized, either
simply initialize the variable or make compiler changes. As a precursor
to removing[2] this[3] macro[4], just initialize this variable to NULL.
No later NULL deref is possible due to the early returns outside of the
(phy->rev >= 7 && phy->rev < 19) case, which explicitly tests for NULL.
