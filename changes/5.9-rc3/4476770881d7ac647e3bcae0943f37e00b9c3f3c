remoteproc: Add remoteproc character device interface

Add the character device interface into remoteproc framework.
This interface can be used in order to boot/shutdown remote
subsystems and provides a basic ioctl based interface to implement
supplementary functionality. An ioctl call is implemented to enable
the shutdown on release feature which will allow remote processors to
be shutdown when the controlling userspace application crashes or hangs.
