arm64: dts: qcom: sm8250: change ufs node name to ufshc

The ufs-qcom driver checks that the name matches the androidboot.bootdevice
parameter provided by the bootloader, which uses the name ufshc. Without
this change UFS fails to probe.

I think this is broken behavior from the ufs-qcom driver, but using the
name ufshc is consistent with dts for sdm845/sm8150/etc.
