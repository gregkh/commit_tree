io_uring: remove sequence from io_kiocb

req->sequence is used only for deferred (i.e. DRAIN) requests, but
initialised for every request. Remove req->sequence from io_kiocb
together with its initialisation in io_init_req().

Replace it with a new field in struct io_defer_entry, that will be
calculated only when needed in io_req_defer(), which is a slow path.
