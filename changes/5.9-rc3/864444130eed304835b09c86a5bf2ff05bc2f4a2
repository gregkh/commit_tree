iommu/mediatek: Modify MMU_CTRL register setting

The MMU_CTRL register of MT8173 is different from other SoCs.
The in_order_wr_en is bit[9] which is zero by default.
Other SoCs have the vitcim_tlb_en feature mapped to bit[12].
This bit is set to one by default. We need to preserve the bit
when setting F_MMU_TF_PROT_TO_PROGRAM_ADDR as otherwise the
bit will be cleared and IOMMU performance will drop.
