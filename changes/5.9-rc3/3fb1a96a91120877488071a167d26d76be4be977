libbpf: Fix build on ppc64le architecture

On ppc64le we get the following warning:

  In file included from btf_dump.c:16:0:
  btf_dump.c: In function ‘btf_dump_emit_struct_def’:
  ../include/linux/kernel.h:20:17: error: comparison of distinct pointer types lacks a cast [-Werror]
    (void) (&_max1 == &_max2);  \
                   ^
  btf_dump.c:882:11: note: in expansion of macro ‘max’
      m_sz = max(0LL, btf__resolve_size(d->btf, m->type));
             ^~~

Fix by explicitly casting to __s64, which is a return type from
btf__resolve_size().
