mm/gup: restrict CMA region by using allocation scope API

We have well defined scope API to exclude CMA region.  Use it rather than
manipulating gfp_mask manually.  With this change, we can now restore
__GFP_MOVABLE for gfp_mask like as usual migration target allocation.  It
would result in that the ZONE_MOVABLE is also searched by page allocator.
For hugetlb, gfp_mask is redefined since it has a regular allocation mask
filter for migration target.  __GPF_NOWARN is added to hugetlb gfp_mask
filter since a new user for gfp_mask filter, gup, want to be silent when
allocation fails.

Note that this can be considered as a fix for the commit 9a4e9f3b2d73
("mm: update get_user_pages_longterm to migrate pages allocated from CMA
region").  However, "Fixes" tag isn't added here since it is just
suboptimal but it doesn't cause any problem.
