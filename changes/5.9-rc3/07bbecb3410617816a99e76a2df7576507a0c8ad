net: Restrict receive packets queuing to housekeeping CPUs

With the existing implementation of store_rps_map(), packets are queued
in the receive path on the backlog queues of other CPUs irrespective of
whether they are isolated or not. This could add a latency overhead to
any RT workload that is running on the same CPU.

Ensure that store_rps_map() only uses available housekeeping CPUs for
storing the rps_map.
