cpufreq: acpi-cpufreq: Mark 'dummy' variable as __always_unused

If we fail to use a variable, even a 'dummy' one, then the compiler
complains that it is set but not used.  We know this is fine, so we
set it as __always_unused to let the compiler know.

Fixes the following W=1 kernel build warning(s):

 drivers/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c: In function ‘cpu_freq_read_intel’:
 drivers/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c:247:11: warning: variable ‘dummy’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
 drivers/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c: In function ‘cpu_freq_read_amd’:
 drivers/cpufreq/acpi-cpufreq.c:265:11: warning: variable ‘dummy’ set but not used [-Wunused-but-set-variable]
