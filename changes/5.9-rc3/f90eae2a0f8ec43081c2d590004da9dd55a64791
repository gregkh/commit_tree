mm/swap_slots.c: simplify alloc_swap_slot_cache()

Patch series "clean up some functions in mm/swap_slots.c".

When I studied the code of mm/swap_slots.c, I found some places can be
improved.

This patch (of 3):

Both "slots" and "slots_ret" are only need to be freed when cache already
allocated.  Make them closer, seems more clear.

No functional change.
