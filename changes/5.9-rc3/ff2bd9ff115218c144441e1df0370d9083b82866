KVM: SVM: Fix sev_pin_memory() error handling

The sev_pin_memory() function was modified to return error pointers
instead of NULL but there are two problems.  The first problem is that
if "npages" is zero then it still returns NULL.  Secondly, several of
the callers were not updated to check for error pointers instead of
NULL.

Either one of these issues will lead to an Oops.
