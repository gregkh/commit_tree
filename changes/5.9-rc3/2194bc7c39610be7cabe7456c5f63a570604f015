PCI: Add device even if driver attach failed

device_attach() returning failure indicates a driver error while trying to
probe the device. In such a scenario, the PCI device should still be added
in the system and be visible to the user.

When device_attach() fails, merely warn about it and keep the PCI device in
the system.

This partially reverts ab1a187bba5c ("PCI: Check device_attach() return
value always").
