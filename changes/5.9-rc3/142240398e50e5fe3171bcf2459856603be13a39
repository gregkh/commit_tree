audit: add gfp parameter to audit_log_nfcfg

Fixed an inconsistent use of GFP flags in nft_obj_notify() that used
GFP_KERNEL when a GFP flag was passed in to that function.  Given this
allocated memory was then used in audit_log_nfcfg() it led to an audit
of all other GFP allocations in net/netfilter/nf_tables_api.c and a
modification of audit_log_nfcfg() to accept a GFP parameter.
