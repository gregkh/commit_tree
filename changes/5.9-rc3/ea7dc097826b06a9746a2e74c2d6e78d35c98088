ASoC: amd: Replacing component->name with codec_dai->name.

Replacing string compare with "codec_dai->name" instead of comparing with
"codec_dai->component->name" in hw_params because,
Here the component name for codec RT1015 is "i2c-10EC5682:00"
and will never be "rt1015-aif1" as it is codec-dai->name.
So, strcmp() always compares and fails to set the
sysclk,pll,bratio for expected codec-dai="rt1015-aif1".
