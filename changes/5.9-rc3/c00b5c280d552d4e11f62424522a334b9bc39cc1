arm64: dts: qcom: msm8916: Set #address-cells for lpass

As of commit 4ff028f6c108 ("ASoC: qcom: lpass-cpu: Make I2S SD lines
configurable"), lpass now supports children nodes to configure the
MI2S SD lines to use for one of the I2S ports. For example:

lpass@7708000 {
	dai@3 {
		reg = <MI2S_QUATERNARY>;
		qcom,playback-sd-lines = <1>;
	};
};

The "reg" property refers to the DAI number in this case,
so we need to set #address-cells and #size-cells appropriately
to avoid DTC warnings.
