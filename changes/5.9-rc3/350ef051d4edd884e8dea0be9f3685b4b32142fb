padata: remove stop function

padata_stop() has two callers and is unnecessary in both cases.  When
pcrypt calls it before padata_free(), it's being unloaded so there are
no outstanding padata jobs[0].  When __padata_free() calls it, it's
either along the same path or else pcrypt initialization failed, which
of course means there are also no outstanding jobs.

Removing it simplifies padata and saves text.
