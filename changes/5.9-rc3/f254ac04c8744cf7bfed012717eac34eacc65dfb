io_uring: enable lookup of links holding inflight files

When a process exits, we cancel whatever requests it has pending that
are referencing the file table. However, if a link is holding a
reference, then we cannot find it by simply looking at the inflight
list.

Enable checking of the poll and timeout list to find the link, and
cancel it appropriately.
