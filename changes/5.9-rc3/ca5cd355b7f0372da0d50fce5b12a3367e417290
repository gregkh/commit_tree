bpf, selftests: use :: 1 for localhost in tcp_server.py

Using localhost requires the host to have a /etc/hosts file with that
specific line in it. By default my dev box did not, they used
ip6-localhost, so the test was failing. To fix remove the need for any
/etc/hosts and use ::1.

I could just add the line, but this seems easier.
