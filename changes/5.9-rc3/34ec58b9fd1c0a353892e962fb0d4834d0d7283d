Revert "Bluetooth: btusb: Disable runtime suspend on Realtek devices"

This reverts commit 7ecacafc240638148567742cca41aa7144b4fe1e.

Testing this change on a board with RTL8822CE, I found that enabling
autosuspend has no effect on the stability of the system. The board
continued working after autosuspend, suspend and reboot.

The original commit makes it impossible to enable autosuspend on working
systems so it should be reverted. Disabling autosuspend should be done
via module param or udev in userspace instead.
