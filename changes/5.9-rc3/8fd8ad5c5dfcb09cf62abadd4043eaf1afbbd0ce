lockdep: Add preemption enabled/disabled assertion APIs

Asserting that preemption is enabled or disabled is a critical sanity
check.  Developers are usually reluctant to add such a check in a
fastpath as reading the preemption count can be costly.

Extend the lockdep API with macros asserting that preemption is disabled
or enabled. If lockdep is disabled, or if the underlying architecture
does not support kernel preemption, this assert has no runtime overhead.
