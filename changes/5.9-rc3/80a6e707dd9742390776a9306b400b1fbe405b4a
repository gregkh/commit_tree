kprobes: Remove show_registers() function prototype

Remove show_registers() function prototype because this function
has been renamed by commit 57da8b960b9a ("x86: Avoid double stack
traces with show_regs()"), and commit 80006dbee674 ("kprobes/x86:
Remove jprobe implementation") has removed the caller in kprobes.
So this doesn't exist anymore.
