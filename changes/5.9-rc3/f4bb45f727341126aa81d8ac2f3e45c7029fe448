drm/i915: Trim set_timer_ms() intervals

Use the plain msec_to_jiffies() rather than the _timeout variant so we
round down and do not add an extra jiffy to our interval. For example,
with timeslicing we do not want to err on the longer side as any
fairness depends on catching hogging contexts on the GPU. Bring on
CFS.
