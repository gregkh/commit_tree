selftests: pmtu.sh: Add tests for bridged UDP tunnels

The new tests check that IP and IPv6 packets exceeding the local PMTU
estimate, both locally generated and forwarded by a bridge from
another node, result in the correct route exceptions being created,
and that communication with end-to-end fragmentation over VXLAN and
GENEVE tunnels is now possible as a result of PMTU discovery.

Part of the existing setup functions aren't generic enough to simply
add a namespace and a bridge to the existing routing setup. This
rework is in progress and we can easily shrink this once more generic
topology functions are available.
