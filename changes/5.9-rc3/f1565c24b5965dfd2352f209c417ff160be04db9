powerpc: use the generic dma_ops_bypass mode

Use the DMA API bypass mechanism for direct window mappings.  This uses
common code and speed up the direct mapping case by avoiding indirect
calls just when not using dma ops at all.  It also fixes a problem where
the sync_* methods were using the bypass check for DMA allocations, but
those are part of the streaming ops.

Note that this patch loses the DMA_ATTR_WEAK_ORDERING override, which
has never been well defined, as is only used by a few drivers, which
IIRC never showed up in the typical Cell blade setups that are affected
by the ordering workaround.
