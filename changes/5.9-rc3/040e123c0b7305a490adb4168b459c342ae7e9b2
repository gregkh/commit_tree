drm/i915/gem: Avoid kmalloc under i915->mm_lock

Rearrange the allocation of the mm_struct registration to avoid
allocating underneath the i915->mm_lock, so that we avoid tainting the
lock (and in turn many other locks that may be held as i915->mm_lock is
taken, and those locks we may want on the free [shrinker] paths). In
doing so, we convert the lookup to be RCU protected by courtesy of
converting the free-worker to be an rcu_work.

v2: Remember to use hash_rcu variants to protect the list iteration from
concurrent add/del.
