ARM: dts: rockchip: Fix VBUS on rk3288-vyasa

Connect the voltage regulator of vbus to the otg connector.
Depending on the current mode this is enabled (in "host" mode")
or disabled (in "peripheral" mode). The regulator must be updated
if the controller is configured in "otg" mode and the status changes
between "host" and "peripheral".
