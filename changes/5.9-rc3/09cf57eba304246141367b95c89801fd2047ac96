KVM: arm64: Split hyp/switch.c to VHE/nVHE

switch.c implements context-switching for KVM, with large parts shared between
VHE/nVHE. These common routines are moved to a header file, VHE-specific code
is moved to vhe/switch.c and nVHE-specific code is moved to nvhe/switch.c.

Previously __kvm_vcpu_run needed a different symbol name for VHE/nVHE. This
is cleaned up and the caller in arm.c simplified.
