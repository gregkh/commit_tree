iio: remove left-over comments about parent assignment

These were obtained by doing a 'git diff | grep \/\*', in the previous diff
to find comments. These needed a bit more manual review, as the semantic
patch isn't great for catching these.

The result is:
 	/* Initialize Counter device and driver data */
 	/* Initialize IIO device */
 	/* Establish that the iio_dev is a child of the spi device */
 	/* Estabilish that the iio_dev is a child of the spi device */
 	/* Initiate the Industrial I/O device */
 	/* Establish that the iio_dev is a child of the device */
-	/* establish that the iio_dev is a child of the i2c device */
-	/* establish that the iio_dev is a child of the i2c device */
 	/* This is only used for removal purposes */
 	/* setup the industrialio driver allocated elements */
 	/* variant specific configuration */
 	/* Setup for userspace synchronous on demand sampling. */
 	st->readback_delay_us += 5; /* Add tWAIT */
-	/* Establish that the iio_dev is a child of the i2c device */
 	/* Establish that the iio_dev is a child of the i2c device */

Out of which, 4 are really left-over comments about parent assignment.
3 of them are removed by the semantic patch, as the comment removed (by
spatch) would be for an empty line.
