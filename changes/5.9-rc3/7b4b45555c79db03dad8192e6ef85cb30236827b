media: videobuf2: add queue memory consistency parameter

Preparations for future V4L2_FLAG_MEMORY_NON_CONSISTENT support.

Extend vb2_core_reqbufs() parameters list to accept requests'
->flags, which will be used for memory consistency configuration.

An attempt to allocate a buffer with consistency requirements
which don't match queue's consistency model will fail.
