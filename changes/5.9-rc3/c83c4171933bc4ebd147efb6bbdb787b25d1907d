habanalabs: halt device CPU only upon certain reset

Currently the driver halts the device CPU in the halt engines function,
which halts all the engines of the ASIC. The problem is that if later on we
stop the reset process (due to inability to clean memory mappings in time),
the CPU will remain in halt mode. This creates many issues, such as
thermal/power control and FLR handling.

Therefore, move the halting of the device CPU to the very end of the reset
process, just before writing to the registers to initiate the reset. In
addition, the driver now needs to send a message to the device F/W to
disable it from sending interrupts to the host machine because during halt
engines function the driver disables the MSI/MSI-X interrupts.
