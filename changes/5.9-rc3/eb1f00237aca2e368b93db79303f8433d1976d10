lockdep,trace: Expose tracepoints

The lockdep tracepoints are under the lockdep recursion counter, this
has a bunch of nasty side effects:

 - TRACE_IRQFLAGS doesn't work across the entire tracepoint

 - RCU-lockdep doesn't see the tracepoints either, hiding numerous
   "suspicious RCU usage" warnings.

Pull the trace_lock_*() tracepoints completely out from under the
lockdep recursion handling and completely rely on the trace level
recusion handling -- also, tracing *SHOULD* not be taking locks in any
case.
