arm64: dts: sdm845: add Inline Crypto Engine registers and clock

Add the vendor-specific registers and clock for Qualcomm ICE (Inline
Crypto Engine) to the device tree node for the UFS host controller on
sdm845, so that the ufs-qcom driver will be able to use inline crypto.

Use a separate register range rather than extending the main UFS range
because there's a gap between the two, and the ICE registers are
vendor-specific.  (Actually, the hardware claims that the ICE range also
includes the array of standard crypto configuration registers; however,
on this SoC the Linux kernel isn't permitted to access them directly.)
