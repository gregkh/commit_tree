net/tls: fix sign extension issue when left shifting u16 value

Left shifting the u16 value promotes it to a int and then it
gets sign extended to a u64.  If len << 16 is greater than 0x7fffffff
then the upper bits get set to 1 because of the implicit sign extension.
Fix this by casting len to u64 before shifting it.
