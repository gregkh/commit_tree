kcov: unconditionally add -fno-stack-protector to compiler options

Unconditionally add -fno-stack-protector to KCOV's compiler options, as
all supported compilers support the option.  This saves a compiler
invocation to determine if the option is supported.

Because Clang does not support -fno-conserve-stack, and
-fno-stack-protector was wrapped in the same cc-option, we were missing
-fno-stack-protector with Clang. Unconditionally adding this option
fixes this for Clang.
