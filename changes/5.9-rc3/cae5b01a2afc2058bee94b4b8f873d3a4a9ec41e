nvmet: introduce the passthru configfs interface

When CONFIG_NVME_TARGET_PASSTHRU as 'passthru' directory will
be added to each subsystem. The directory is similar to a namespace
and has two attributes: device_path and enable. The user must set the
path to the nvme controller's char device and write '1' to enable the
subsystem to use passthru.

Any given subsystem is prevented from enabling both a regular namespace
and the passthru device. If one is enabled, enabling the other will
produce an error.
