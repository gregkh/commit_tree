rcu: Simplify the calculation of rcu_state.ncpus

There is only 1 bit set in mask, which means that the only difference
between oldmask and the new one will be at the position where the bit is
set in mask.  This commit therefore updates rcu_state.ncpus by checking
whether the bit in mask is already set in rnp->expmaskinitnext.
