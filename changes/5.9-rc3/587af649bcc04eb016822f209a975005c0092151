x86/build: Move max-page-size option to LDFLAGS_vmlinux

This option is only required for vmlinux on 64-bit, to enforce 2MiB
alignment, so set it in LDFLAGS_vmlinux instead of KBUILD_LDFLAGS. Also
drop the ld-option check: this option was added in binutils-2.18 and all
the other places that use it already don't have the check.

This reduces the size of the intermediate ELF files
arch/x86/boot/setup.elf and arch/x86/realmode/rm/realmode.elf by about
2MiB each. The binary versions are unchanged.

Move the LDFLAGS settings to all be together and just after CFLAGS
settings are done.
