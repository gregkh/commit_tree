misc: cb710: sgbuf2: Add missing documentation for cb710_sg_dwiter_write_next_block()'s 'data' arg

An attempt was made to provide a proper kerneldoc header for
cb710_sg_dwiter_write_next_block(), but a description for it's 'data'
argument was missed.

Squashes W=1 kernel build warning:

 drivers/misc/cb710/sgbuf2.c:131: warning: Function parameter or member 'data' not described in 'cb710_sg_dwiter_write_next_block'
