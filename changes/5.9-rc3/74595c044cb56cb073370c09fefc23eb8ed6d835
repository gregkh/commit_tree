scsi: scsi_debug: Fix in_use bitmap corruption

Heavy testing indicates the irqsave() spinlock around the __set_bit() is
insufficient to stop following clear_bit() calls being rarely applied
out-of-order. Also the nearby failed kzalloc() path leading to
SCSI_MLQUEUE_HOST_BUSY does not properly undo the in_use bitmap and
num_in_q, fix.
