media: rc: return proper error code on error handling path in init

If lirc_dev_init() fails during module initialization, rc_core_init()
returns 0 denoting success. This can cause different issues during
further operation of the module. The patch fixes the return value of
rc_core_init() on the corresponding error handling path.
