[elf-fdpic] use elf_dump_thread_status() for the dumper thread as well

the only reason to have it open-coded for the first (dumper) thread is
that coredump has a couple of process-wide notes stuck right after the
first (NT_PRSTATUS) note of the first thread.  But we don't need to
make the data collection side irregular for the first thread to handle
that - it's only the logics ordering the calls of writenote() that
needs to take care of that.
