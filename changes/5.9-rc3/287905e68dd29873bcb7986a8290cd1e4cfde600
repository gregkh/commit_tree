driver core: Expose device link details in sysfs

It's helpful to be able to look at device link details from sysfs. So,
expose it in sysfs.

Say device-A is supplier of device-B. These are the additional files
this patch would create:

/sys/class/devlink/device-A:device-B/
	auto_remove_on
	consumer/ -> .../device-B/
	runtime_pm
	status
	supplier/ -> .../device-A/
	sync_state_only

/sys/devices/.../device-A/
	consumer:device-B/ -> /sys/class/devlink/device-A:device-B/

/sys/devices/.../device-B/
	supplier:device-A/ -> /sys/class/devlink/device-A:device-B/

That way:
To get a list of all the device link in the system:
ls /sys/class/devlink/

To get the consumer names and links of a device:
ls -d /sys/devices/.../device-X/consumer:*

To get the supplier names and links of a device:
ls -d /sys/devices/.../device-X/supplier:*
