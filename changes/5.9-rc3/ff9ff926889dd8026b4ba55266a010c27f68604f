perf/core: Factor out functions to allocate/free the task_ctx_data

The method to allocate/free the task_ctx_data is going to be changed in
the following patch. Currently, the task_ctx_data is allocated/freed in
several different places. To avoid repeatedly modifying the same codes
in several different places, alloc_task_ctx_data() and
free_task_ctx_data() are factored out to allocate/free the
task_ctx_data. The modification only needs to be applied once.
