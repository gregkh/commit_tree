regulator: pwm-regulator: Demote kerneldoc header to standard comment

This particular comment doesn't have anything to do with documenting
functions or data structures.  Instead it is used as a section header.

Fixes W=1 warning:

 drivers/regulator/pwm-regulator.c:55: warning: Function parameter or member 'rdev' not described in 'pwm_regulator_init_state'
