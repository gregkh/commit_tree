powerpc/hv-24x7: Add sysfs files inside hv-24x7 device to show cpumask

Patch here adds a cpumask attr to hv_24x7 pmu along with ABI documentation.

Primary use to expose the cpumask is for the perf tool which has the
capability to parse the driver sysfs folder and understand the
cpumask file. Having cpumask file will reduce the number of perf command
line parameters (will avoid "-C" option in the perf tool
command line). It can also notify the user which is
the current cpu used to retrieve the counter data.

command:# cat /sys/devices/hv_24x7/interface/cpumask
0
