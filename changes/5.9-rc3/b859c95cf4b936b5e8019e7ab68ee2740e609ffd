powerpc/test_emulate_step: Add testcases for divde[.] and divdeu[.] instructions

Add testcases for divde, divde., divdeu, divdeu. emulated instructions
to cover few scenarios,
  - with same dividend and divisor to have undefine RT
    for divdeu[.]
  - with divide by zero to have undefine RT for both
    divde[.] and divdeu[.]
  - with negative dividend to cover -|divisor| < r <= 0 if
    the dividend is negative for divde[.]
  - normal case with proper dividend and divisor for both
    divde[.] and divdeu[.]
