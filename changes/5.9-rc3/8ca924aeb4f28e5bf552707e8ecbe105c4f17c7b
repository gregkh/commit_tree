Documentation/barriers: Remove references to [smp_]read_barrier_depends()

The [smp_]read_barrier_depends() barrier macros no longer exist as
part of the Linux memory model, so remove all references to them from
the Documentation/ directory.

Although this is fairly mechanical on the whole, we drop the "CACHE
COHERENCY" section entirely from 'memory-barriers.txt' as it doesn't
make any sense now that the dependency barriers have been removed.
