rtc: goldfish: Enable interrupt in set_alarm() when necessary

When use goldfish rtc, the "hwclock" command fails with "select() to
/dev/rtc to wait for clock tick timed out". This is because "hwclock"
need the set_alarm() hook to enable interrupt when alrm->enabled is
true. This operation is missing in goldfish rtc (but other rtc drivers,
such as cmos rtc, enable interrupt here), so add it.
