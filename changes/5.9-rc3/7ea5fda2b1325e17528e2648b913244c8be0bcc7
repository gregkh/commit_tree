ptp: ptp_clockmatrix: update to support 4.8.7 firmware

With 4.8.7 firmware, adjtime can change delta instead of absolute time,
which greately increases snap accuracy. PPS alignment doesn't have to
be set for every single TOD change. Other minor changes includes:
adding more debug logs, increasing snap accuracy for pre 4.8.7 firmware
and supporting new tcs2bin format.
