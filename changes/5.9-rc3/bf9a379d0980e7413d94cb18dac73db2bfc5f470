ext4: don't allow overlapping system zones

Currently, add_system_zone() just silently merges two added system zones
that overlap. However the overlap should not happen and it generally
suggests that some unrelated metadata overlap which indicates the fs is
corrupted. We should have caught such problems earlier (e.g. in
ext4_check_descriptors()) but add this check as another line of defense.
In later patch we also use this for stricter checking of journal inode
extent tree.
