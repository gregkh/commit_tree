usb: typec: ucsi: Rework ppm_lock handling

The ppm_lock really only needs to be hold during 2 functions:
ucsi_reset_ppm() and ucsi_run_command().

Push the taking of the lock down into these 2 functions, renaming
ucsi_run_command() to ucsi_send_command() which was an existing
wrapper already taking the lock for its callers.

This simplifies things for the callers and removes the difference
between ucsi_send_command() and ucsi_run_command() which has led
to various locking bugs in the past.
