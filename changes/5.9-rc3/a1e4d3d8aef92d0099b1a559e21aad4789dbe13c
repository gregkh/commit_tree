scsi: lpfc: Fix FCoE speed reporting

Current Link speed was shown as "unknown" in sysfs for FCoE ports. In this
scenario, the port was working in 20G speed, which happens to not be a
speed handled by the driver.

Add support for all possible link speeds that could get reported from
port_speed field in link state ACQE.

Additionally, as supported_speeds can't be manipulated via the FCoE driver
on a converged ethernet port (it must be managed by the nic function),
don't fill out the supported_speeds field for the fc host object in sysfs.

Revise debug logging to report Link speed mgmt valuess.
