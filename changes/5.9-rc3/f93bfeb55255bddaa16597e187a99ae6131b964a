macintosh/via-macii: Poll the device most likely to respond

Poll the most recently polled device by default, rather than the lowest
device address that happens to be enabled in autopoll_devs. This improves
input latency. Re-use macii_queue_poll() rather than duplicate that logic.
This eliminates a static struct and function.
