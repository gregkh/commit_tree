s390/qdio: remove internal polling in non-thinint path

For non-thinint devices in LPAR, qdio polls an idle Input Queue for a
little while to catch more work. But platform support for thinints has
been around practically _forever_ by now, so this micro-optimization is
seeing 0 actual use. Remove it to reduce the overall complexity of the
hot path.

In the meantime we also grew support for driver-level polling
(eg. NAPI in qeth), so it's quite questionable how useful this would
actually be on current kernels.
