x86/cpufeatures: Add Architectural LBRs feature bit

CPUID.(EAX=07H, ECX=0):EDX[19] indicates whether an Intel CPU supports
Architectural LBRs.

The "X86_FEATURE_..., word 18" is already mirrored from CPUID
"0x00000007:0 (EDX)". Add X86_FEATURE_ARCH_LBR under the "word 18"
section.

The feature will appear as "arch_lbr" in /proc/cpuinfo.

The Architectural Last Branch Records (LBR) feature enables recording
of software path history by logging taken branches and other control
flows. The feature will be supported in the perf_events subsystem.
