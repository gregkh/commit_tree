powerpc/powernv/sriov: Move SR-IOV into a separate file

pci-ioda.c is getting a bit unwieldly due to the amount of stuff jammed in
there. The SR-IOV support can be extracted easily enough and is mostly
standalone, so move it into a separate file.

This patch also moves the PowerNV SR-IOV specific fields from pci_dn and
moves them into a platform specific structure. I'm not sure how they ended
up in there in the first place, but leaking platform specifics into common
code has proven to be a terrible idea so far so lets stop doing that.
