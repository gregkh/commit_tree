tipc: set ub->ifindex for local ipv6 address

Without ub->ifindex set for ipv6 address in tipc_udp_enable(),
ipv6_sock_mc_join() may make the wrong dev join the multicast
address in enable_mcast(). This causes that tipc links would
never be created.

So fix it by getting the right netdev and setting ub->ifindex,
as it does for ipv4 address.
