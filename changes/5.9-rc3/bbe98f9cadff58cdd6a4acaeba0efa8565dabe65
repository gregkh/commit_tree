khugepaged: khugepaged_test_exit() check mmget_still_valid()

Move collapse_huge_page()'s mmget_still_valid() check into
khugepaged_test_exit() itself.  collapse_huge_page() is used for anon THP
only, and earned its mmget_still_valid() check because it inserts a huge
pmd entry in place of the page table's pmd entry; whereas
collapse_file()'s retract_page_tables() or collapse_pte_mapped_thp()
merely clears the page table's pmd entry.  But core dumping without mmap
lock must have been as open to mistaking a racily cleared pmd entry for a
page table at physical page 0, as exit_mmap() was.  And we certainly have
no interest in mapping as a THP once dumping core.
