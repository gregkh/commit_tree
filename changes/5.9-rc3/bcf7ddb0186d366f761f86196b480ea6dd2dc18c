selftests: disable rp_filter for icmp_redirect.sh

h1 is initially configured to reach h2 via r1 rather than the
more direct path through r2. If rp_filter is set and inherited
for r2, forwarding fails since the source address of h1 is
reachable from eth0 vs the packet coming to it via r1 and eth1.
Since rp_filter setting affects the test, explicitly reset it.
