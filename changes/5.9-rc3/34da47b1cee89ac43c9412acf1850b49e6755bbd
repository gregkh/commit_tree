arm64: dts: qcom: apq8016-sbc: Replace spaces with tabs

apq8016-sbc.dtsi uses spaces on some lines instead of tabs.
Make this consistent by converting them to tabs.

Also remove some redundant comments from the DAI link definitions
- this is already visible from the comment block before the "sound"
node or the device node entries itself.
