drivers/acpi: Remove function cast

Remove the function cast in the ACPI_DECLARE_PROBE_ENTRY macro to ensure
that the functions passed as a last parameter to this macro have the
right prototype.

This is an effort to enable -Wcast-function-type in the top-level Makefile
to support Control Flow Integrity builds.
