macintosh/via-macii: Remove read_done state

The driver state machine may enter the 'read_done' state when leaving the
'idle' or 'reading' state. This transition is pointless, as is the extra
interrupt it requires. The interrupt is produced by the transceiver
(even when it has no data to send) because an extra EVEN/ODD toggle
was signalled by the driver. Drop the extra state to simplify the code.
