cpuidle: pseries: Set the latency-hint before entering CEDE

As per the PAPR, each H_CEDE call is associated with a latency-hint to
be passed in the VPA field "cede_latency_hint". The CEDE states that
we were implicitly entering so far is CEDE with latency-hint = 0.

This patch explicitly sets the latency hint corresponding to the CEDE
state that we are currently entering. While at it, we save the
previous hint, to be restored once we wakeup from CEDE. This will be
required in the future when we expose extended-cede states through the
cpuidle framework, where each of them will have a different
cede-latency hint.
