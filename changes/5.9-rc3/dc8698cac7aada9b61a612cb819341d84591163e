libbpf: Add support for BPF XDP link

Sync UAPI header and add support for using bpf_link-based XDP attachment.
Make xdp/ prog type set expected attach type. Kernel didn't enforce
attach_type for XDP programs before, so there is no backwards compatiblity
issues there.

Also fix section_names selftest to recognize that xdp prog types now have
expected attach type.
