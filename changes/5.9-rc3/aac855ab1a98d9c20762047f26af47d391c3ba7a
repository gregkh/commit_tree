xfs: make inode IO completion buffer centric

Having different io completion callbacks for different inode states
makes things complex. We can detect if the inode is stale via the
XFS_ISTALE flag in IO completion, so we don't need a special
callback just for this.

This means inodes only have a single iodone callback, and inode IO
completion is entirely buffer centric at this point. Hence we no
longer need to use a log item callback at all as we can just call
xfs_iflush_done() directly from the buffer completions and walk the
buffer log item list to complete the all inodes under IO.
