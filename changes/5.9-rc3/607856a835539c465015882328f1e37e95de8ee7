drm/i915/display: fix missing null check on allocated dsb object

Currently there is no null check for a failed memory allocation
on the dsb object and without this a null pointer dereference
error can occur. Fix this by adding a null check.

Note: added a drm_err message in keeping with the error message style
in the function.

Addresses-Coverity: ("Dereference null return")
Fixes: afeda4f3b1c8 ("drm/i915/dsb: Pre allocate and late cleanup of cmd buffer")
