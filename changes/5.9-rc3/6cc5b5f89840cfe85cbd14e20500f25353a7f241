xfs: Refactor xfs_attr_try_sf_addname

To help pre-simplify xfs_attr_set_args, we need to hoist transaction
handling up, while modularizing the adjacent code down into helpers. In
this patch, hoist the commit in xfs_attr_try_sf_addname up into the
calling function, and also pull the attr list creation down.
