dmaengine: Actions: get rid of bit fields from dma descriptor

At the moment, Driver uses bit fields to describe registers of the DMA
descriptor structure that makes it less portable and maintainable, and
Andre suugested(and even sketched important bits for it) to make use of
array to describe this DMA descriptors instead. It gives the flexibility
while extending support for other platform such as Actions S700.

This commit removes the "owl_dma_lli_hw" (that includes bit-fields) and
uses array to describe DMA descriptor.
