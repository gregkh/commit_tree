fs: dlm: implement tcp graceful shutdown

During my code inspection I saw there is no implementation of a graceful
shutdown for tcp. This patch will introduce a graceful shutdown for tcp
connections. The shutdown is implemented synchronized as
dlm_lowcomms_stop() is called to end all dlm communication. After shutdown
is done, a lot of flush and closing functionality will be called. However
I don't see a problem with that.

The waitqueue for synchronize the shutdown has a timeout of 10 seconds, if
timeout a force close will be exectued.
