kselftests: cgroup: add kernel memory accounting tests

Add some tests to cover the kernel memory accounting functionality.  These
are covering some issues (and changes) we had recently.

1) A test which allocates a lot of negative dentries, checks memcg slab
   statistics, creates memory pressure by setting memory.max to some low
   value and checks that some number of slabs was reclaimed.

2) A test which covers side effects of memcg destruction: it creates
   and destroys a large number of sub-cgroups, each containing a
   multi-threaded workload which allocates and releases some kernel
   memory.  Then it checks that the charge ans memory.stats do add up on
   the parent level.

3) A test which reads /proc/kpagecgroup and implicitly checks that it
   doesn't crash the system.

4) A test which spawns a large number of threads and checks that the
   kernel stacks accounting works as expected.

5) A test which checks that living charged slab objects are not
   preventing the memory cgroup from being released after being deleted by
   a user.
