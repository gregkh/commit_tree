drm/i915/gt: Harden the heartbeat against a stuck driver

If the driver gets stuck holding the kernel timeline, we cannot issue a
heartbeat and so fail to discover that the driver is indeed stuck and do
not issue a GPU reset (which would hopefully unstick the driver!).
Switch to using a trylock so that we can query if the heartbeat's
timeline mutex is locked elsewhere, and then use the timer to probe if it
remains stuck at the same spot for consecutive heartbeats, indicating
that the mutex has not been released and the engine has not progressed.
