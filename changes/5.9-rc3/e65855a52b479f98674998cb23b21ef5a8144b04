sched/uclamp: Fix a deadlock when enabling uclamp static key

The following splat was caught when setting uclamp value of a task:

  BUG: sleeping function called from invalid context at ./include/linux/percpu-rwsem.h:49

   cpus_read_lock+0x68/0x130
   static_key_enable+0x1c/0x38
   __sched_setscheduler+0x900/0xad8

Fix by ensuring we enable the key outside of the critical section in
__sched_setscheduler()
