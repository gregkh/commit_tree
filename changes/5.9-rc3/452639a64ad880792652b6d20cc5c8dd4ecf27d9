vdpa: make sure set_features is invoked for legacy

Some legacy guests just assume features are 0 after reset.
We detect that config space is accessed before features are
set and set features to 0 automatically.
Note: some legacy guests might not even access config space, if this is
reported in the field we might need to catch a kick to handle these.
