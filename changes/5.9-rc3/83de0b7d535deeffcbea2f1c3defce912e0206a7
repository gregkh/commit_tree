perf metric: Collect referenced metrics in struct metric_ref_node

Collecting referenced metrics in struct metric_ref_node object,
so we can process them later on.

The change will parse nested metric names out of expression and
'resolve' them.

All referenced metrics are dissolved into one context, meaning all
nested metrics events and added to the parent context.
