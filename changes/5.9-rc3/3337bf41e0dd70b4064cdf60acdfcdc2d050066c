selftests/powerpc: Purge extra count_pmc() calls of ebb selftests

An extra count on ebb_state.stats.pmc_count[PMC_INDEX(pmc)] is being per-
formed when count_pmc() is used to reset PMCs on a few selftests. This
extra pmc_count can occasionally invalidate results, such as the ones from
cycles_test shown hereafter. The ebb_check_count() failed with an above
the upper limit error due to the extra value on ebb_state.stats.pmc_count.

Furthermore, this extra count is also indicated by extra PMC1 trace_log on
the output of the cycle test (as well as on pmc56_overflow_test):
