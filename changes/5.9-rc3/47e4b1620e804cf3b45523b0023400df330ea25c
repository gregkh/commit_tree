mlxsw: reg: Increase trap identifier to 10 bits

The trap identifier was increased to 10 bits in new versions of the
Programmer's Reference Manual (PRM).

Increase it accordingly in the Host PacKet Trap (HPKT) register and in
the Completion Queue Element (CQE).

This is significant for subsequent patches that will introduce trap
identifiers which utilize the extended range.
