usb: dwc3: gadget: Don't setup more than requested

The SG list may be set up with entry size more than the requested
length. Check the usb_request->length and make sure that we don't setup
the TRBs to send/receive more than requested. This case may occur when
the SG entry is allocated up to a certain minimum size, but the request
length is less than that. It can also occur when the request is reused
for a different request length.
