bpf: cpumap: Implement XDP_REDIRECT for eBPF programs attached to map entries

Introduce XDP_REDIRECT support for eBPF programs attached to cpumap
entries.
This patch has been tested on Marvell ESPRESSObin using a modified
version of xdp_redirect_cpu sample in order to attach a XDP program
to CPUMAP entries to perform a redirect on the mvneta interface.
In particular the following scenario has been tested:

rq (cpu0) --> mvneta - XDP_REDIRECT (cpu0) --> CPUMAP - XDP_REDIRECT (cpu1) --> mvneta

$./xdp_redirect_cpu -p xdp_cpu_map0 -d eth0 -c 1 -e xdp_redirect \
	-f xdp_redirect_kern.o -m tx_port -r eth0

tx: 285.2 Kpps rx: 285.2 Kpps

Attaching a simple XDP program on eth0 to perform XDP_TX gives
comparable results:

tx: 288.4 Kpps rx: 288.4 Kpps
