xhci: Always restore EP_SOFT_CLEAR_TOGGLE even if ep reset failed

Some device drivers call libusb_clear_halt when target ep queue
is not empty. (eg. spice client connected to qemu for usb redir)

Before commit f5249461b504 ("xhci: Clear the host side toggle
manually when endpoint is soft reset"), that works well.
But now, we got the error log:

    EP not empty, refuse reset

xhci_endpoint_reset failed and left ep_state's EP_SOFT_CLEAR_TOGGLE
bit still set

So all the subsequent urb sumbits to the ep will fail with the
warn log:

    Can't enqueue URB while manually clearing toggle

We need to clear ep_state EP_SOFT_CLEAR_TOGGLE bit after
xhci_endpoint_reset, even if it failed.
