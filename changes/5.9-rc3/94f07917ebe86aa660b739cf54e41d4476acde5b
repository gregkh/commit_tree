drm/panel-simple: Add missing connector type for some panels

The DRM panel bridge core requires connector type to be set up properly,
otherwise it rejects the panel. The missing connector type problem popped
up while I was trying to wrap CLAA070WP03XG panel into a DRM bridge in
order to test whether panel's rotation property work properly using
panel-simple driver on NVIDIA Tegra30 Nexus 7 tablet device, which uses
CLAA070WP03XG display panel.

The NVIDIA Tegra DRM driver recently gained DRM bridges support for the
RGB output and now driver wraps directly-connected panels into DRM bridge.
Hence all panels should have connector type set properly now, otherwise
the panel's wrapping fails.

This patch adds missing connector types for the LVDS panels that are found
on NVIDIA Tegra devices:

  1. AUO B101AW03
  2. Chunghwa CLAA070WP03XG
  3. Chunghwa CLAA101WA01A
  4. Chunghwa CLAA101WB01
  5. EDT ET057090DHU
  6. Innolux N156BGE L21
  7. Samsung LTN101NT05
