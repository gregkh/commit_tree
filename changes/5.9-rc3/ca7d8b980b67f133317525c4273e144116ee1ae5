memory: add Renesas RPC-IF driver

Add the memory driver for Renesas RPC-IF which registers either SPI or
HyperFLash device depending on the contents of the device tree subnode.
It also provides the absract "back end" device APIs that can be used by
the "front end" SPI/MTD drivers to talk to the real hardware.

Based on the original patch by Mason Yang <masonccyang@mxic.com.tw>.
