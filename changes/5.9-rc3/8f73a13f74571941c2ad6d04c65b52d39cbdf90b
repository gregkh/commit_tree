iio: remove left-over parent assignments

These were found by doing some shell magic:
------------
for file in $(git grep -w devm_iio_device_alloc | cut -d: -f1 | sort | uniq) ; do
	if grep 'parent =' $file | grep -v trig | grep -vq devm_; then
		echo "$file -> $(grep "parent =" $file)"
	fi
done
-----------

The output is bearable [after the semantic patch is applied].
There is a mix of trigger assignments with some iio device parent
assignments that are removed via this patch.

JC: A few more added via inspection of all parent =
statements in drivers/iio. Some of these may just have crossed with this
series, others were less obvious to scripting due to some cross
file / module boundary calls.
