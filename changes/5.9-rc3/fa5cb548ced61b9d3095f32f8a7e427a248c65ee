bpf: Setup socket family and addresses in bpf_prog_test_run_skb

Now it's impossible to test all branches of cgroup_skb bpf program which
accesses skb->family and skb->{local,remote}_ip{4,6} fields because they
are zeroed during socket allocation. This commit fills socket family and
addresses from related fields in constructed skb.
