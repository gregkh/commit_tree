net: ena: cosmetic: change ena_com_stats_admin stats to u64

The size of the admin statistics in ena_com_stats_admin is changed
from 32bit to 64bit so to align with the sizes of the other statistics
in the driver (i.e. rx_stats, tx_stats and ena_stats_dev).

This is done as part of an effort to create a unified API to read
statistics.
