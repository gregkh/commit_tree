selftests/bpf: Add test for CGROUP_STORAGE map on multiple attaches

This test creates a parent cgroup, and a child of that cgroup.
It attaches a cgroup_skb/egress program that simply counts packets,
to a global variable (ARRAY map), and to a CGROUP_STORAGE map.
The program is first attached to the parent cgroup only, then to
parent and child.

The test cases sends a message within the child cgroup, and because
the program is inherited across parent / child cgroups, it will
trigger the egress program for both the parent and child, if they
exist. The program, when looking up a CGROUP_STORAGE map, uses the
cgroup and attach type of the attachment parameters; therefore,
both attaches uses different cgroup storages.

We assert that all packet counts returns what we expects.
