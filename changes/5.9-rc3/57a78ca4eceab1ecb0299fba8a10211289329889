drm/i915/gem: Mark the buffer pool as active for the cmdparser

If the execbuf is interrupted after building the cmdparser pipeline, and
before we commit to submitting the request to HW, we would attempt to
clean up the cmdparser early. While we held active references to the vma
being parsed and constructed, we did not hold an active reference for
the buffer pool itself. The result was that an interrupted execbuf could
still have run the cmdparser pipeline, but since the buffer pool was
idle, its target vma could have been recycled.

Note this problem only occurs if the cmdparser is running async due to
pipelined waits on busy fences, and the execbuf is interrupted.
