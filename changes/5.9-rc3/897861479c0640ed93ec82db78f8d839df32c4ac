KVM: x86: Add helper functions for illegal GPA checking and page fault injection

This patch adds two helper functions that will be used to support virtualizing
MAXPHYADDR in both kvm-intel.ko and kvm.ko.

kvm_fixup_and_inject_pf_error() injects a page fault for a user-specified GVA,
while kvm_mmu_is_illegal_gpa() checks whether a GPA exceeds vCPU address limits.
