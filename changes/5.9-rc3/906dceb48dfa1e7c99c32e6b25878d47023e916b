media: staging: rkisp1: rsz: fix resolution limitation on sink pad

Resizer sink pad is limited by what the ISP can generate.
The configurations describes what the resizer can produce.

This was tested on a Scarlet device with ChromiumOs, where the selfpath
receives 2592x1944 and produces 1600x1200 (which isn't possible without
this fix).
