KVM: LAPIC: Set the TDCR settable bits

It is a little different between Intel and AMD, Intel's bit 2
is 0 and AMD is reserved. On bare-metal, Intel will refuse to set
APIC_TDCR once bits except 0, 1, 3 are setting, however, AMD will
accept bits 0, 1, 3 and ignore other bits setting as patch does.
Before the patch, we can get back anything what we set to the
APIC_TDCR, this patch improves it.
